        <p>Ed Sheeran's property portfolio is now said to be worth £61million, after the singer reportedly purchased new homes during lockdown.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old musician, who is estimated to be worth north of £200million, has added boosted his portfolio by £4.5million after making the cash purchases, according to The Sun.</p>

<p>Chart-topping superstar Ed reportedly filed documents of the new purchases under his two firms, the Maverick Properties Limited and Maverick Commercial Properties Limited, with Companies House. </p>

<p>Big bucks: Ed Sheeran's property portfolio is now said to be worth £61million, after the singer reportedly purchased new homes during lockdown. Pictured in 2017 </p>

<p>Back in May, it was reported that the star paid for his entire property portfolio was paid for in cash, leaving him completely mortgage-free.</p>

<p>The chart-topping pop superstar has splashed £10million on the London property market over the years, growing his empire to 27 flats, houses, and mansions.</p>

<p>And the star is said to have used his financial standing to his advantage as he snapped up the properties, by building his empire without relying on any bank loans</p>

<p>Hot property: Ed splashed £10million on the London property market over the years, growing his empire to 27 flats, houses, and mansions, as well as his own 16-acre estate in Suffolk</p>

<p>Suffolk pile: He's also said to be making himself self-sufficient on his sprawling 16-acre Suffolk pile, by setting up a beehive on the edge of his estate</p>

<p>Country living: After amassing an estimated £160million fortune, the superstar set about creating his own extraordinary estate – dubbed Sheeranville</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'He has a great portfolio of properties and he owns the lot free and clear. There was no need to borrow the cash from a lender because he already had it.</p>

<p>'Some people have the cash tied up so need to raise a mortgage but Ed has piles of the cash in the bank so there was no point in letting a bank earn money by lending him the money. He just bought them outright.'</p>

<p>He's also said to be making himself self-sufficient on his sprawling 16-acre Suffolk pile, by setting up a beehive on the edge of his estate, where he can make his own honey – in addition to growing vegetables, owning an orchard and raising livestock.</p>

<p>'Ed’s placed a wooden beehive at the edge of his estate,' another source close to the singer told The Sun. 'He’s already got other produce growing and some animals so he’s clearly enjoying the idea of that lifestyle.' </p>

<p>Big purchases: MailOnline previously reported that Sheeran bought several Notting Hill properties to prevent complaints about 'loud music and parties' (stock image)</p>

<p>Living it up: The star lives in the lap of luxury with his wife Cherry Seaborn and their newborn daughter Lyra. Pictured in 2018</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a representative for Ed Sheeran for comment. </p>

<p>In May the singer-songwriter was officially named as the UK's richest musician under the age of 30.</p>

<p>Ed saw his wealth soar by another £40million, meaning his total wealth is £200million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.</p>

<p>And the global pop star – who is married to his childhood sweetheart Cherry Seaborn, with whom he welcomed daughter Lyra over the summer – now boasts enough properties to fill a Monopoly board.</p>

<p>Flats: Sheeran has bought a pair of flats by the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home (stock image) </p>

<p>Streets: Properties on Reckitt Road form part of his £57million property empire (stock image)</p>

<p>Fortune: The pop star has also recently acquired two expensive flats down Floral Street in Covent Garden (stock image of Floral Street pictured above) </p>

<p>Five assets in the capital have been incorporated into Sheeran's vast 'Edopoly' property empire, taking the number he owns in London up to 22. </p>

<p>His latest additions include two properties on Floral Street in Covent Garden, and a pair of flats by the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home down Palmer Road.</p>

<p>These four homes alone are thought to be among his most expensive, with conservative estimates putting them at a total value of £9million.  </p>

<p>Sheeran also owns five apartments in Wiverton Tower in Whitechapel worth £3.9million and a mansion in Holland Park valued at nearly £20million. </p>

<p>The Shape of You singer has another four properties in Holland Park worth £11million, and a trendy Portobello Road restaurant called Bertie Blossoms which will soon be converted into a pub. </p>

<p>Upscale: Queensdale Place in Holland Park is another brick in Sheeran's empire (stock image)</p>

<p>Chiswick: The multi-millionaire 29-year-old has a property worth £2.4million in Chiswick (stock image of Queen Anne's Gardens in Chiswick pictured above)</p>

<p>Impressive: Sheeran's impressive 'Edopoly' property empire also includes three down Findon Road in Hammersmith (stock image of Findon Road pictured)</p>

<p>MailOnline previously reported that Sheeran bought several Notting Hill properties to prevent complaints about 'loud music and parties'. </p>

<p>Outside of London, the musician owns a vast £3.7million Suffolk country estate dubbed 'Sheeranville' by local villagers.</p>

<p>After moving into a Grade II-listed farmhouse in his hometown of Framlington in 2012, Sheeran bought another four homes.</p>

<p>Ed Sheeran has accumulated an unbelievable 27 properties since 2012, both within and outside of London. To date, his portfolio includes:  </p>

<p>He has had a pub, a swimming pool, and a treehouse built, and last November submitted proposals to have a 'place of worship' constructed.</p>

<p>The multimillionaire chart-topper is in lockdown with wife Cherry Seaborn, 28, at the mansion where he also grows fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>It comes after Ed refused to furlough any of his ten staff at his Notting Hill pub - in sharp contrast to other celebrities who have been blasted for demanding state cash.</p>

<p>The star will be using his personal fortune to prop up his bar Bertie Blossoms in west London, said to be named after his wife Cherry.</p>

<p>The bar was forced to close in March because of the coronavirus shutdown, but it appears workers in its bar and kitchen are being paid by the singer to be at home.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Sheeran has confirmed that he will not ask the Treasury to pay up to 80 per cent of their salaries, up to a threshold of £2,500 per month.</p>

<p>The A Team hitmaker opened the doors to Bertie Blossoms in September 2019 with a snazzy launch which saw the likes of Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy in attendance.</p>

<p>Co-owned with his manager Stuart Camp, the pub has been billed as a 'bright green, low-lit bar set over two floors with extensive drinks list including house cocktails'. </p>

<p>Sheeran announced he would take a break from his music career after finishing his Divide Tour, which ran from 2017, last year. It is the highest-grossing tour of all time. </p>

<p>Wow: The singer, 29, also acquired properties on Portland Road in Holland Park (stock image)</p>

<p>Trendy: Sheeran has another four properties in Holland Park worth £11million, and a trendy Portobello Road restaurant (pictured) called Bertie Blossoms, to be turned into a pub</p>

<p>Tower: The Suffolk-born singer-songwriter also has five apartments in Wiverton Tower in Whitechapel (stock image pictured), estimated to be worth around £3.9million</p>

<p>Sheeranville: Outside of London, the Shape of You singer owns a vast £3.7million Suffolk country estate dubbed 'Sheeranville' by local villagers, to which he moved in 2012</p>
