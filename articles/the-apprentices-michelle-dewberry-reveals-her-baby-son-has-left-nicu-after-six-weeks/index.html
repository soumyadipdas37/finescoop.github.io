        <p>The Apprentice star Michelle Dewberry has revealed that her baby son has left neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after six weeks.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur, 40, took to Instagram on Thursday to post a sweet picture of herself and ex-Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, 52, wearing face masks while holding the tot in a carrier.</p>

<p>Alongside the snap, Michelle posted a lengthy caption as she reflected on their 'incredibly challenging, upsetting and draining' journey after her son was born prematurely at 31 weeks.</p>

<p>Journey: The Apprentice star Michelle Dewberry has revealed that her baby son has left neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after six weeks (pictured with partner and ex-Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, 52) </p>

<p>She also admitted that it is an experience she will 'never forget' and it's left her 'more anxious' about her son that she would like to be.  </p>

<p>The Apprentice star penned: 'And so a new chapter begins... After almost 6 weeks, our little boy graduated the NICU.</p>

<p>'What an emotional roller coaster...Incredibly challenging, upsetting &amp; draining-Yet also so often awe-inspiring.'</p>

<p>Michelle then reflected on the milestones they have encountered so far, she continued: 'So many ups/downs &amp; so many milestones to celebrate; from the complex (being able to breathe unassisted, or feed without a tube etc) through to the simple (finally wearing clothes).</p>

<p>Challenging: Alongside the snap, Michelle posted a lengthy caption as she reflected on their 'incredibly challenging, upsetting and draining' journey after her son was born prematurely at 31 weeks</p>

<p>Anxiety: She also admitted that it is an experience she will 'never forget' and it's left her 'more anxious' about her son that she would like to be</p>

<p>'Neonatology &amp; neonatologists are incredible &amp; premmies are so strong, true fighters.'</p>

<p>Speaking about her anxiety, she continued: 'It was an experience which I'll never forget &amp; one which has made me slightly more anxious about my son than I'd like to be (I hope that settles in time!).'</p>

<p>Preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) is a pregnancy complication that occurs when an expectant mother's waters break before 37 weeks.</p>

<p>Once the amniotic sac has broken, it raises the risk the baby will be born prematurely, or the mother or baby will suffer an infection.</p>

<p>PPROM affects just three per cent of pregnancies in the UK and US, but is thought to be responsible for around 30-to-40 per cent of premature births.</p>

<p>Its cause is usually unknown.</p>

<p>Previously having a preterm birth, an infection of the reproductive system or vaginal bleeding raises the risk, as does smoking during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Symptoms can include:</p>

<p>PPROM is diagnosed via a speculum that looks inside the vagina for fluid leaking from the cervix.</p>

<p>A pH test then determines if the fluid is amniotic, vaginal or urine.</p>

<p>Treatment depends on the symptoms, pregnancy and a woman's general health.</p>

<p>Bed rest may be required, with doctors monitoring for signs of labour, as well the baby's health and indications of infection.</p>

<p>Steroids may be given to help the baby's lungs grow and antibiotics might be prescribed to reduce the risk of infection.</p>

<p>Tocolytic medicines may be given to prevent premature labour.</p>

<p>However, in some cases, labour may be the best option, such as if there are complications.</p>

<p>Pregnant women are rarely induced before 34 weeks.</p>

<p>PPROM's main complication is a premature birth, however, it can also lead to infections of the amniotic fluid or membranes, separation of the placenta from the uterus, or a C-section. </p>

<p>Source: University of Rochester </p>

<p>Michelle admitted that her pregnancy hasn't been what she 'imagined' and it has caused her a lot of 'upset' and 'grief'. </p>

<p>She continued: 'My pregnancy was not what I'd imagined &amp; I'll be honest &amp; say this has all caused me a lot of upset/grief.'</p>

<p>Listing her experience, she said: 'It included; my waters breaking entirely unexpectedly 3 months early, a 4 week hospital stay for me full of scary moments, an emergency c-section.</p>

<p>'My son being taken straight from me &amp; me not meeting him for 8 hours (&amp; that being a simple glimpse of him in intensive care, in an incubator with multiple lines into/monitors on him), leaving hospital without him, painful breast expressing &amp; then almost 6 weeks of being at his incubator every day, as we tried to get him strong.'</p>

<p>She added: 'All of that during a pandemic, which often made things twice as hard.'</p>

<p>As well as reflecting on their journey so far, Michelle also noted the 'hurdles' they will need to overcome in the future.</p>

<p>She said: 'My son still has some hurdles to overcome but it is lovely to finally be able to start a 'normal' life with him. I'm privileged to be his mummy &amp; I can't wait to see the little boy he will become. The world is his oyster...❤️'</p>

<p>Michelle also explained the reason why she has been so open about her pregnancy and baby journey. </p>

<p>She said: 'Not every pregnancy/birth is perfect &amp; the reason I've been so open about my journey is because we only seem to see/read about the happy side-I feel it important to show the other side.</p>

<p>'Unless you've been through PPROM &amp;/or NICU, it's hard to truly understand it, but it leaves a mark on your heart &amp; soul, which I suspect will be there forever. To those who have, or are yet to experience it, know that you are not alone. ❤️.'</p>

<p>Michelle signed off her post by using a collection of hashtags, which included  #ppromawareness, #nicumom and #firsttimemum.'</p>

<p>The Apprentice star revealed in July that she had welcomed her first child to the world, a son born at 31 weeks.  </p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, she shared a trio of images of the tot from within hospital and added a gushing caption about the arrival and her complicated pregnancy. </p>

<p>Filling fans in on the birth, she wrote: 'I am super proud and happy to share the news that I am now a Mummy!! My beautiful little man was brought into this world way too early (31 weeks) following further complications.'</p>

<p>Michelle went on: 'He is already showing that he takes after his mamma and is a strong, feisty little human. Having got through my complicated pregnancy, I have now entered the next chapter on our journey, that of NICU. </p>

<p>'I wouldn’t wish NICU on anybody and certainly not in a pandemic. It is exhausting, draining and often very scary... Here’s hoping we graduate this chapter as quickly, as healthy and as safely as humanly possible'. </p>

<p>Just a fortnight earlier, Michelle revealed she had been in hospital for a month after her waters broke early.</p>

<p>He's here: The Apprentice star revealed in July that she had welcomed her first child to the world, a son born at 31 weeks</p>

<p>The star took to social media to reveal she'd passed the 30th week of her pregnancy, but had been hospitalised after suffering from preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), which can trigger early labour.</p>

<p>She has since kept fans updated with her journey, sharing her 'painful' breast pumping journey and giving her son 'skin-to-skin contact'. </p>

<p>Michelle first announced she was expecting her first child in April, but confessed that the COVID-19 pandemic had 'taken away many of the small joys of pregnancy.' </p>

<p>The star revealed she'd been diagnosed with PPROM, which is a complication in pregnancy when the amniotic sac, or waters, burst before the 37th week, and sometimes triggers premature labour. </p>

<p>Due to COVID-19 limitations, Michelle also revealed she had been unable to have visitors during her time in hospital, calling the early days 'horrendous and traumatic.'</p>

<p>Worrying: Just a fortnight earlier, Michelle revealed she had been in hospital for a month after her waters broke early </p>

<p>In a post shared on 26 June she wrote: ''You can now visit a loved one'', they said. After months of lockdown, I didn't need asking twice! I couldn't get over to Hull to see my Mum quick enough!</p>

<p>'Sadly, no sooner had I arrived, my waters unexpectedly broke, <em>very, very</em> prematurely (this is called PPROM). </p>

<p>'Que me immediately being admitted to the nearest hospital. What followed next was pretty horrendous I'm not gonna lie and traumatic, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>'Over a week later, I haven't moved and that hospital has become my current home - looks like I won't be going anywhere for a while. No visitors are allowed, at all-no exceptions-because of Covid so it's just been me and my bump.'</p>

<p>Michelle sadly suffered a miscarriage in 2006. The TV star was believed to be three months pregnant with The Apprentice co-star Syed Ahmed.</p>

<p>Little fighter: She has since kept fans updated with her journey, sharing her 'painful' breast pumping journey and giving her son 'skin-to-skin contact'</p>

<p>A spokesperson told The Mirror at the time: 'Michelle and Syed are both extremely upset and are currently supporting each other through this difficult period.'</p>

<p>Michelle confirmed her relationship with partner Simon in July 2019, just a few months after revealing her plans to become a parent via a sperm donor. </p>

<p>In January 2019, the presenter said on her Sky News debate show The Pledge: 'I don't have a partner and I want to be a mum. </p>

<p>'So I'm going through the process of looking at sperm donor and in this country there is a law where when the children get to 18 they have the legal right to access various identifying information about the father. </p>

<p>'So in this country when you do a donor you have to log identifying information and non-identifying information and when the child reaches 16 and 18, depending on the differences of the information, your child has a right to find out essentially who their father is.</p>

<p>Candid: Michelle admitted that her pregnancy hasn't been what she 'imagined' and it has caused her a lot of 'upset' and 'grief'</p>

<p>'And for me personally I’m in this really complex situation. I wouldn’t regard the donor as my children’s father.' </p>

<p>On Michelle and Simon's blossoming romance, a source told MailOnline the pair put on an affectionate display during a The Specials concert, describing Jordan as 'affectionate, smitten and the perfect gentleman.'</p>

<p>The insider said: 'They met when they were both on the Matthew Wright show. He took her to The Specials concert in London... </p>

<p>Change of plan: Michelle confirmed her romance with ex- Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan in July 2019 (pictured) on social media</p>

<p>'Michelle stood in the sound box - I’m guessing to avoid the crowd following her surgery - and Simon was the perfect gentleman towards her. He was very attentive and affectionate towards her and seemed to be smitten.'</p>

<p>Simon shares an 11-year-old daughter with former Page 3 girl Suzi Walker, the ex-wife of former Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Ian Walker. </p>

<p>Michelle, who grew up on a Hull council estate and dropped out of school at 16 with just two GCSEs, shot to stardom after becoming Lord Alan Sugar's Apprentice in 2006. </p>

<p>In the 14 years which followed, she forged a successful career in business and TV, and even aimed to become an MP for the Brexit Party, which ended in defeat as she lost to Labour's Emma Hardy late last year.  </p>
