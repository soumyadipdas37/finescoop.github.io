        <p>Selena Gomez has firmly planted herself in the competitive world of makeup with her new Rare cosmetics line.</p>

<p>But on Thursday the Texas native proved she is up for the task as she expertly made herself in a video for Vogue.</p>

<p>The Fetish singer spent 11 minutes going from makeup free to glam with cat eyes and red lip gloss as she talked fans through her process proving she has what it takes to become the next Kylie Jenner makeup mogul.</p>

<p>She did it well: Selena Gomez went from makeup free, left, to glammed, right, in a new makeup tutorial shared on Thursday by Vogue to promote her Rare beauty line</p>

<p>She did it first: Kylie Jenner has made a fortune by selling makeup with the help of her long tutorials for Kylie Cosmetics</p>

<p>All the while the siren passes on friendly advice as she says she knows women feel 'pressure' to look a 'certain way.' But she reminds everyone that 'You're special, you're supposed to be who you are.</p>

<p>Gomez then adds: 'I have met thousands of people in my life and I wish they could see what I see in them.'</p>

<p>She is first seen makeup free with only long eyelashes in place as she talks while in the bathroom of her Los Angeles home.</p>

<p>In her mansion: She is first seen makeup free with only long eyelashes in place as she talks while in the bathroom of her Los Angeles home</p>

<p>'Being in different facets of the industry, it's been really fun to play with [beauty] because it makes a character when you're on set, it creates something magical,' she said.</p>

<p>'I was heavily involved in the entire process because I also care so much about mental health and I believe it's a part of your self esteem, it's a part of the way you see yourself.' </p>

<p>The Wizards Of Waverly Place star shared it's important to take care of your skin. </p>

<p>All fun: 'Being in different facets of the industry, it's been really fun to play with [beauty] because it makes a character when you're on set, it creates something magical,' she said</p>

<p>The way it goes: 'I was heavily involved in the entire process because I also care so much about mental health and I believe it's a part of your self esteem, it's a part of the way you see yourself'</p>

<p>The basics: Then comes Rare Beauty Touch Weightless Foundation</p>

<p>An expert: The Monte Carlo actress used a sponge to dab on the makeup carefully</p>

<p>'When you're taking care of your skin, you're taking care of your body, and your mind, and soul—I think it's all connected,' said the Wolves singer. </p>

<p>Then she moved on to her acne.</p>

<p>'I try not to pick at anything—something that's hard!' </p>

<p>She uses Tatcha's cult-favorite Dewy Skin Moisturizer and Drunk Elephant sunscreen. </p>

<p>More: And she out Soft Pinch Liquid Blush on her cheeks. 'It lifts your cheekbones a bit,' she said before adding Benefit's Hoola Matte Bronzer</p>

<p>'I like to put sunscreen on, not only because it's important to keeping your skin looking fresh, but I have Lupus, so being in the sun is kind of difficult for me,' said Selena.</p>

<p>Then comes Rare Beauty Touch Weightless Foundation and Soft Pinch Liquid Blush on her cheeks. </p>

<p>'It lifts your cheekbones a bit,' she said before adding Benefit's Hoola Matte Bronzer. </p>

<p>Gomez uses the Marc Jacobs Beauty Eye-Conic Multi-Finish Eyeshadow Palette in Scandalust.</p>

<p>She takes time to do her cat-eye, sharing a trick.</p>

<p>Using Perfect Strokes Matte Liquid Liner, she draws the outline of the cat eye on the cornes of her eyes then fills in.</p>

<p>Selena certainly has a steady hand and it looks professional.</p>

<p>'Watch this part, it's heaven!' she says as she adds Fuchsia Ascend shade of her Lip Souffle lipstick. </p>

<p>Color on her eyes: Gomez uses the Marc Jacobs Beauty Eye-Conic Multi-Finish Eyeshadow Palette in Scandalust</p>

<p>'I believe makeup should be [an accessory] to complement what's beautiful about you,' said Gomez. </p>

<p>This comes a day after she said she felt 'really frustrated' without a diagnosis for her mental health.</p>

<p>The Heart Wants What It Wants hitmaker previously revealed she had bipolar disorder, but admits before she got a diagnosis, she felt 'really alone' because she didn't know anyone else felt the way she did.</p>

<p>'It is something that is very close to me. I've been honest about things in mental health and about my story, so I knew that it was going to be something that I should include,' the Rare singer told Bustle this week. 'I know that there is still such a stigma, but there's still so many people who don't even know their diagnosis.'</p>

<p>Meow: She takes time to do her cat-eye, sharing a trick. Using Perfect Strokes Matte Liquid Liner, she draws the outline of the cat eye on the corners of her eyes then fills in</p>

<p>The ex of Justin Bieber added, 'And it is really frustrating because when people don't know, it feels like you're really alone, and you feel crazy. Because like, why doesn't anyone else feel like I feel?'</p>

<p>Selena has also offered her advice to her fans who are worried about their mental health and how it has been affected during the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, as she praised her family and 'chosen family' for helping her through it and keeping her 'sane'.</p>

<p>She added: 'I just really ... it breaks my heart, because I actually don't know what to say. </p>

<p>Dreamy: The cat eyes make her eyes look wider will adding intrigue to her glam</p>

<p>'I would just say that I would not have been able to walk through any of this without my family, even my chosen family. I think having a connection to people is what keeps me sane. </p>

<p>'And I also feel like taking walks around, being in nature - all of that sounds cliche, but it's actually very true.'</p>

<p>Earlier this week the siren talked to Cosmopolitan magazine about her changing weight and how she feels 'insecure' these days.  </p>

<p>A year ago the Rare songbird said that she was body shamed online for putting on a few pounds. The cause of the weight gain was medications she took to help her combat Lupus.</p>

<p>The former child star was diagnosed with Lupus, an autoimmune condition causing inflammation to the joints, skin and other organs, according to the National Health Society (NHS). </p>

<p>The lips are last: 'Watch this part, it's heaven!' she says as she adds Fuchsia Ascend shade of her Lip Souffle lipstick</p>

<p>Her condition got so dire, Selena had to have kidney transplant surgery after facing kidney failure.</p>

<p>The star talked about her body as she plugged her new beauty brand Rare to Cosmo. </p>

<p>She said she worked on the line after feeling 'insecure' with her looks. </p>

<p>'I've gotten insecure. I also have lupus so I fluctuate in my weight a lot, so I've had to learn pretty early to have thick skin when it comes to this stuff and to understand that it doesn't matter at all. It's just hateful. It's all it is,' she admitted to the publication this week.</p>

<p>How it all holds in: And lastly she siren spritzes her face as she closes her eyes</p>

<p>'So I wanted to find a way to make this brand into a community - into a lifestyle that's beyond make-up and showing you how to apply it.'</p>

<p>The Texas native added: 'It's about talking about makeup and the relationship you have [with it]. </p>

<p>'I don't want this to be about me. I know obviously it's created by me, but I would be more proud to see the mission we have behind it as well as enjoy it.'</p>

<p>In November 2019 the star told vodcast Giving Back Generation she had to go on medication to treat her Lupus. That made her add some weight.</p>

<p>'I have lupus and deal with kidney issues and high blood pressure, so I deal with a lot of health issues, and for me, that's when I really started noticing more of the body image stuff,' she stated.</p>

<p>Up close: The singer also told Cosmo that after growing up in the spotlight, she soon became aware of her looks by comparing herself to others in the industry</p>

<p>The cover girl felt attacked on social media for her new shape. No one knew at the time she was treating her Lupus. 'It's the medication I have to take for the rest of my life—it depends on even the month, to be honest,' she said.</p>

<p>'So for me, I really noticed when people started attacking me for that. And in reality, that's just my truth. I fluctuate. It depends on what's happening in my life.'</p>

<p>The cruel comments caused her to hide. 'That got me big time,' she said. 'That really messed me up for a bit.'</p>

<p>In 2019 she found a way to deal with the pressure. 'I'm very happy with living my life and being present,' she said. </p>

<p>Makeup is a part of her life: 'This area has always been a part of my life. I've been working since I was seven. And as I got older and started working on my show [Wizards of Waverly Place], it was such an important part of my character,' she noted</p>

<p>'Because that's it. Similar to me posting a photo and walking away; for me that's it. I will do a red carpet, I will do whatever; I don't need to see it; I participated; I felt wonderful and that's where the extent of it is. </p>

<p>'I don't care to expose myself to everyone and hear what they have to say.' </p>

<p>The singer also told Cosmo that she has been wearing makeup since age seven.</p>

<p>'This area has always been a part of my life. I've been working since I was seven. And as I got older and started working on my show [Wizards of Waverly Place], it was such an important part of my character,' she said.</p>
