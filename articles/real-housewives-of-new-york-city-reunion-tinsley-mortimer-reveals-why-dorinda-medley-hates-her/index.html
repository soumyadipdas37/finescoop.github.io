        <p>Tinsley Mortimer revealed the hidden reason Dorinda Medley 'hates' her Thursday on the first part of The Real Housewives Of New York City's season 12 reunion.</p>

<p>According to 45-year-old blond socialite, Dorinda, 55, could not get over the fact that her ex, dry cleaner John Mahdessian, also 55, received money from Tinsley's fiancé, Scott Kluth, 41.</p>

<p>She recalled that during the previous season, Dorinda had gotten in a 'horrific' fight with John after learning that Scott had given him a financial gift.</p>

<p>Hidden reason: Tinsley Mortimer revealed the hidden reason Dorinda Medley 'hates' her Thursday on the first part of The Real Housewives Of New York City's season 12 reunion</p>

<p>'You called John screaming,' Tinsley said. 'The producers wanted me to not stay in the house that night because you were going so crazy. They were actually worried about my safety. You turned on me the moment that John got that money.'</p>

<p>Dorinda's anger over the matter led her to lash out at Tinsley over the years, it was claimed.</p>

<p>'The betrayal that you felt towards John manifested in anger towards me,' Tinsley told Dorinda.</p>

<p>Dorinda denied it all, saying she'd never heard about the gift or gotten involved in John's finances, but she was shown in a flashback giving him a hard time about Scott.</p>

<p>Money matter: According to 45-year-old blond socialite, Dorinda, 55, could not get over the fact that her ex, dry cleaner John Mahdessian, also 55, received money from Tinsley's fiancé, Scott Kluth, 41</p>

<p>Video proof: Dorinda denied it all, saying she'd never heard about the gift or gotten involved in John's finances, but she was shown in a flashback giving him a hard time about Scott</p>

<p>'I have done nothing for you to hate me the way that you do,' Tinsley continued. 'Your jealousy, your hatred, your obsession with my relationship… hey girl, I'm engaged, we're getting married, so you can just move on.'</p>

<p>'With no financial security,' Dorinda said. 'Tinsley, I hate your life.'</p>

<p>Tinsley was asked by show host Andy Cohen, 52, what, if anything, had prevented her from finding her 'fairytale' with Scott sooner.</p>

<p>Life hater: 'With no financial security,' Dorinda said. 'Tinsley, I hate your life'</p>

<p>'Being in New York and Chicago, even though they are fairly close, was a big issue,' Tinsley noted, adding that she'd dated a man from Chicago in an attempt to make Scott jealous.</p>

<p>'Scott never made me choose between him and the show,' Tinsley went on. 'I knew that the show was definitely an issue for him and I knew that when we got back together, it was a decision we had to make. I chose him over being here with everybody. I didn't want to put him in the mix of all this because it could be toxic, and it could be bad for my relationship.'</p>

<p>Being quarantined during the coronavirus epidemic been 'amazing' for the two of them, she added. 'I was the housewife I always wanted to be. I was cooking and cleaning, and making the house. I was finally able to show him that I was this person, too. I think he never saw me in a normal situation of being at home and being together.'</p>

<p>Long distance: 'Being in New York and Chicago, even though they are fairly close, was a big issue,' Tinsley noted, adding that she'd dated a man from Chicago in an attempt to make Scott jealous</p>

<p>Tinsley said she'd never gotten a great deal of support from the cast about her relationship with Scott, and explained that she'd been secretive about their renewed fling because she was 'embarrassed' that she'd cried over him 'so many times.'</p>

<p>On the day Tinsley announced she was leaving the show, Dorinda suggested that Tinsley take a turkey baster and try to get pregnant.</p>

<p>Tinsley was still upset about it, and considered it an insult to women doing IVF.</p>

<p>Baster remark: On the day Tinsley announced she was leaving the show, Dorinda suggested that Tinsley take a turkey baster and try to get pregnant</p>

<p>'I am shamed for not having a child,' she said. 'I am shamed for wanting one.'</p>

<p>'I'm surprised you're not pregnant already,' Dorinda observed. 'You've been talking about getting pregnant non-stop.'</p>

<p>She then apologized for having made the comment, though no one believed her.</p>

<p>Said sorry: Dorinda then apologized for having made the comment, though no one believed her</p>

<p>Asked what her real issue with Tinsley was, she said, 'I believe half of what I hear in life and all of what I see. You guys saw just what was on the show. There was a lot of stuff, Tinsley, that went on.'</p>

<p>The RHONY reunion was the first live one Bravo had shot since March, and it took place in a warehouse decorated with old show relics.</p>

<p>Everyone showed up in masks and black dresses, sitting at a safe distance from one another.</p>

<p>Pandemic precautions: The RHONY reunion was the first live one Bravo had shot since March, and it took place in a warehouse decorated with old show relics</p>

<p>Leah McSweeney, 38, sported a see-through dress that looked like she was wearing it over black underwear, while Sonja Morgan, 56, had a new hairstyle and a touch-up.</p>

<p>'I lifted the drapes again, this time permanently,' she confessed. 'I had a neck lift, and a lower lift, and I wanted to look like Ellen Barkin.'</p>

<p>Many of the women had left the city during the height of the coronavirus quarantine.</p>

<p>Show newcomer: Leah McSweeney, 38, sported a see-through dress that looked like she was wearing it over black underwear</p>

<p>Sonja confirmed that she had been 'trapped at a spa in Palm Springs,' where she went through three weeks of colonics to cleanse her system from so much RHONY partying.</p>

<p>Ramona had stayed in Florida with her ex-husband Mario Singer, and daughter Avery, 25.</p>

<p>She told Andy there was no chance of a romantic reunion with Mario, saying she still loved him but was no longer 'in love' with him.</p>

<p>New look: Sonja Morgan, 56, had a new hairstyle and a touch-up</p>

<p>On social media, Leah had proclaimed herself 'disgusted' with Ramona's Florida sojourn, and addressed it during the reunion, telling her it showed 'a total lack of awareness.'</p>

<p>'In New York City, people are dying and they can't even say 'bye' to their families, and on Instagram, you're posting, 'Here I am with my workout, and I just upgraded to a new modern suite,' she told Ramona.</p>

<p>'I don't even care if you don't wear a mask,' she continued. 'It was more about the total lack of empathy of how many people are suffering in this country and the world.'</p>

<p>So disgusted: On social media, Leah had proclaimed herself 'disgusted' with Ramona's Florida sojourn, and addressed it during the reunion, telling her it showed 'a total lack of awareness'</p>

<p>Ramona protested, 'I would wake up every morning at 4:00, and read all the horrific news, about 100,000 cases, 100,000 deaths, it's climbing, it's climbing. It was scarier than s***. And then I would live my day the best I could with what I had.'</p>

<p>Ramona revealed that she'd been feeling ill in February and thought it was Lyme disease, so went to Aspen, Colorado, to recuperate, followed by Florida, where she quarantined for two months. In May, she tested for the COVID antibodies, and found out she'd had it.</p>

<p>'I followed the rules in Florida, and I was allowed to come back, b****!' she told Leah.</p>

<p>Health history: Ramona revealed that she'd been feeling ill in February and thought it was Lyme disease, so went to Aspen, Colorado, to recuperate, followed by Florida, where she quarantined for two months</p>

<p>Dorinda was irritated by the fact that Ramona attended a bash with Donald Trump Jr., and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who then tested positive.</p>

<p>She remembered that Ramona had gone to a speakeasy in Florida without her mask on.</p>

<p>'I don't wear a mask in the ocean,' Ramona repeated over and over, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>No mask: 'I don't wear a mask in the ocean,' Ramona repeated over and over, clapping her hands</p>

<p>'It's not about wearing a mask, you f***ing idiot!' Leah yelled. 'It's about showing yourself dancing, like you're not being respectful during a pandemic.'</p>

<p>'Stop! Shut up!' Andy called out.</p>

<p>He turned his attention to Leah, noting that she'd gained many fans during the season.</p>

<p>Fan favorite: Leah immediately  became a fan favorite during her first season on the Bravo show</p>

<p>'Housewives super-fan and actress Sarah Paulson, when I asked her to rate your freshman season on a scale of 1 to 10, she gave you a 25,' he said. 'John Oliver said, 'I think she's good. Throwing tiki torches, naked diving into a pool and basically trashing Ramona's house. I'm not sure I've laughed at anything this year harder than I've laughed at that episode.'</p>

<p>Leah had started drinking just before making her first appearance on the show, but had since quit again and gotten a new apartment.</p>

<p>Her parents and daughter Kier, 12, all watched RHONY, she added, noting that her dad had 'big freakin' crush on Sonja.'</p>

<p>The host: Andy Cohen looked dapper while interviewing the women in-person amid the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Asked to explain why she got a tattoo of wings on her vagina, Leah said she'd hallucinated purple wings during a drug trip at age 17, and wanted to put them somewhere unusual.</p>

<p>When a viewer asked about the abundance of drinking that occurred on the show, Andy addressed Dorinda, wondering if she'd any inclination to stop.</p>
