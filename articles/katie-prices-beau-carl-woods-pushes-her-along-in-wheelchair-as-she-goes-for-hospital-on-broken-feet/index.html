        <p>She recently returned to social media just a week after announcing she was taking a break to recover from surgery on her two broken feet.</p>

<p>And Katie Price, 42, was seen getting a helping hand from her beau Carl Woods, 31, on Monday, as she went to London's Chelsea &amp; Westminster hospital for a checkup.</p>

<p>The former glamour model looked happy and relaxed as she was pushed out of the main building in a wheelchair, before her boyfriend lifted her into their car.</p>

<p>Checkup: Katie Price was seen getting a helping hand from her beau Carl Woods on Monday, as she went to London's Chelsea &amp; Westminster hospital for a checkup on her broken feet</p>

<p>Wearing a plain black top with matching patent bottoms, Katie boosted her golden locks with extra-long extensions, which fell beyond her shoulders.</p>

<p>Highlighting her famous looks with a rich palette of makeup, the TV personality accessorised with a pair of gold pendant necklaces.</p>

<p>With a face mask resting around her wrist, the star sat with her two feet elevated in casts as she prepared to make her way home from the hospital.</p>

<p>Getting a lift: The former glamour model looked happy and relaxed as she was pushed out of the main building in a wheelchair, before her boyfriend lifted her into their car</p>

<p>Ensemble: Wearing a plain black top with matching patent bottoms, Katie boosted her golden locks with extra-long extensions, which fell beyond her shoulders</p>

<p>Golden girl: Highlighting her famous looks with a rich palette of makeup, the TV personality accessorised with a pair of gold pendant necklaces</p>

<p>For his part, hunky Carl looked casually cool in a white T-shirt, which he teamed with a pair of distressed jeans and running shoes.</p>

<p>Her outing comes after she took to Instagram to share a snap from her wheelchair as she reflected on her 'tough journey' and reassured fans she's 'feeling stronger and determined' on Saturday.</p>

<p>One week earlier, Katie announced that she was taking a break from social media to heal after breaking both her feet and ankles in a horror accident.</p>

<p>Katie shared a recent snap of her sat in her wheelchair with her booted feet, and wrote: 'Happy Saturday. I’m back online and just want to thank everyone for all the love and support! </p>

<p>Glamour: Looking as glam as ever despite her injury, the star sat with her feet elevated in casts</p>

<p>Nailed it! She sported the perfect manicure as she was pushed through the hospital grounds</p>

<p>'It’s a tough journey, but I’m feeling stronger and determined to get through this with all the support of my family, friends, followers and my amazing man @carljwoods.</p>

<p>'Carl and I will be posting a lot more content together on our joint page @adventuresofkatieandcarl and look out for our new YouTube travel channel coming very soon.'</p>

<p>Mere hours later Katie went onto share a loved-up snap with her beau Carl and penned the caption: 'Saturday Vibes with my prince @carljwoods.'  </p>

<p>It comes after Katie revealed she feared that her horrific foot injury would leave her 'paralysed,' after she plummeted 25ft off a wall at a theme park in Turkey and landed on her feet. </p>

<p>Tough journey: Her outing comes after she took to Instagram to share a snap from her wheelchair as she reflected on her 'tough journey'</p>

<p>Casually cool: For his part, hunky Carl looked casually cool in a white T-shirt, which he teamed with a pair of distressed jeans and running shoes</p>

<p>Right by your side: Carl has remained former glamour model Katie's side throughout her ordeal</p>

<p>Katie explained how her feet are 'destroyed' following the incident, and admitted she has returned to The Priory to learn to 'walk again.'</p>

<p>The star, who was on holiday with her boyfriend Carl and her children Princess, 13, and Junior, 15, at the time, said doctors told her they have amputated legs with injuries similar to hers.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, she said: 'The doctors said I'm lucky I'm not dead. I could have hit my head and I could have been paralysed, I am actually lucky I landed on my feet.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I thought, "I'm never going to walk again". The doctors said they've cut off legs before after seeing injuries like mine.'</p>

<p>Katie underwent an eight-hour operation to rebuild her feet after she was 'mucking about' following a few drinks and jumped off what she thought was a 'small wall' at the Land of Legends theme park. </p>

<p>Driver: Shielding his eyes with a pair of stylish sunglasses, Carl drove them to the appointment</p>

<p>Loved up: The pair looked as loved up as ever as they stepped out for the latest hospital visit</p>

<p>The model revealed how she has returned to The Priory because her 'mental health' has been 'badly affected' by her injuries.  </p>

<p>She last visited The Priory in September 2018 and spent 28 days in the facility after her family urged her to seek help following wild partying antics in Mallorca. </p>

<p>It comes as the star revealed how 'everything' has hit her 'so hard' and she feels 'humiliated' at the prospect of having to learn to 'walk again'.</p>

<p>She spoke of how everyday tasks are 'impossible' including going to the toilet, cooking, reaching for the cupboards and taking a bath where she could 'drown'.</p>

<p>Katie, who is also mother to Harvey, 18, Jett, seven, and Bunny, six, explained how she is 'embarrassed' of having to be pushed around and told how people treat her 'differently'.   </p>

<p>She's back! Katie returned to social media on Saturday, just a week after announcing she was taking a break to recover from surgery on her broken feet</p>

<p>Back to business: The former glamour model reflected on her 'tough journey' and reassured fans she's 'feeling stronger and determined' in her first post after returning to the platform</p>

<p>She explained how she 'feels sorry' for boyfriend Carl who has doted on her since the accident and said that it is 'demoralising' seeing him push her in the wheelchair.</p>

<p>But the CBB star described how she would be 'lost' without her beau and revealed how she can still 'keep Carl happy in the bedroom' with him having 'no complaints'. </p>

<p>However Katie also vowed that she is 'never drinking again' following the traumatising accident and plans to cover up her 'mangled' feet with tattoos. </p>

<p>It comes as Katie recently revealed she was stepping out of the spotlight on Thursday on medical advice as she has been told to 'rest in order to heal'.</p>

<p>Amid the social media hiatus, Katie appeared in a promotional fake tan video shared on her Instagram on Sunday evening - with her representatives confirming this was a pre-scheduled post. </p>

<p>Exciting: Katie also announced her plans to launch a travel YouTube channel with beau Carol as she recovers from her injury</p>

<p>Nasty: It comes after Katie revealed she feared that her horrific foot injury would leave her 'paralysed,' after she plummeted 25ft off a wall at a theme park in Turkey</p>

<p>They said: 'I can confirm that Katie has not returned to social media.  Katie's team posted the Instagram and this was not posted by Katie herself. It was filmed prior to her hiatus.' </p>

<p>The star posted a statement to Instagram Stories last month which read: 'Katie is taking some time out of the media spotlight. </p>

<p>'Her family and Dr's have told Katie that she must rest in order to heal. Katie wants to thank everyone for their ongoing support and will be back when she feels ready.'    </p>

<p>Katie's representative told MailOnline: 'Katie is taking a much needed break. Katie has found the past few weeks terribly draining, both mentally and physically challenging and in order to bounce back is convalescing.'  </p>

<p>Take a break: The-mother-of-five announced the week before that she was following doctor's orders and taking a break from social media to heal following the horrific injuries</p>

<p>Stay strong: Katie also vowed that she is 'never drinking again' following the traumatising accident and plans to cover up her 'mangled' feet with tattoos</p>
