<p>The star was smiling as she held up her pink rose bouquet with one hand and in the other held the hand of her new wife while the two walked on a white floor.</p>

<p>Celebrity fans wished them well. Lena Waithe said, 'Congrats @niecynash1!! Sending y’all so much love!!!' while Sarah Paulson said, 'I love you so much.' </p>

<p>The Scream Queens star also shared an image with her new wife on Instagram Stories with a hashtag for 'plot twist.' </p>

<p>The two go back in time. Jessica sang at Niecy's wedding to Jay in 2011 in Malibu.  </p>

<p>In June 2018 the two were together on the set of Claws and two months later, Betts posted a video where she was singing to the star at her wedding to Tucker: 'This woman of God, I’m honored and blessed in her presence. She’s anointed and appointed. She singin my tune.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Carol Denise Betts 💍 @jessicabettsmusic #LoveWins🌈 📸 @robertector</p>

<p>A post shared by  Niecy Nash (@niecynash1) on Aug 31, 2020 at 12:23pm PDT</p>

<p>In February, Jessica shared a topless photo of Niecy to Instagram to wish her a happy birthday. 'Happy Birthday to a Real One,' said the songbird.</p>

<p>Jessica is a singer and songwriter who also plays the guitar. She started her career when she Stonecreek Records in 1998 the two years later worked on the 2000 release of Get Up which was featured on the soundtrack for Big Mommas House.</p>

<p>In 2005 Betts won Road to Stardom and has gone on to be inducted as a BET Music Matters artists. Her hit song is Catch Me. </p>

<p>Niecy filed for divorce from Jay in December and they finalized their divorce in March with the star officially singe on June 21. </p>

<p>'Wishing you both happiness': Filmmaker Ava DuVernay shared an image from the ceremony on social media and said it had been 'an honor' to witness their wedding</p>

<p>In October, DailyMail.com exclusively reported that the couple's troubles began amid strain over living in different cities, Nash's graphic sex scenes on television and her sexy new look.</p>

<p>In her property settlement, the actress 'gets their house in Bell Canyon, CA and the 2016 Tesla. She also gets to keep her production company, Chocolate Chick,' TMZ reported.</p>

<p>Additionally, the outlet said that Jay, who is an electrical engineer, will keep his 2011 Ford F-150 truck and a $184,820 payout from his ex-wife.</p>

<p>The money is Tucker's cut from the sale of a property they once shared, and aside from that, both parties agreed not to request spousal support. </p>

<p>Interestingly, prior to news of their split being made public, Nash had quietly listed the Bell Canyon home for $1.2 million in July of 2019.</p>

<p>According to sources who spoke with DailyMail.com, the couple had been having issues for nearly two years prior to finally calling it quits. </p>

<p>Betts was there for the last wedding: The two go back in time. Jessica sang at Niecy's wedding to Jay in 2011 in Malibu</p>

<p>Niecy and Jay were married in Malibu in 2011 but their relationship took a turn in part due to the star's full-body cosmetic surgery makeover and her 'extreme career ambitions.'</p>

<p>A source close to the former couple told DailyMail.com at the time: 'Niecy got a brand new body right before she went to film Claws down in New Orleans and that's when their troubles began. Jay was really uncomfortable with her graphic sex scenes on the show and that made their problems worse.</p>

<p>'They were living in two different cities and Jay expressed he didn't like his wife being in New Orleans while he was in LA.'</p>

<p>“You got Divorced? Betts, say less” 😂👽💍</p>

<p>A post shared by  Jessica Betts (@jessicabettsmusic) on Sep 4, 2020 at 4:36pm PDT</p>

<p>When the comedy-drama had its big premiere in LA in June of 2017, Tucker didn't attend because the couple had been fighting about the show, according to the source.</p>

<p>And while Tucker did attend Nash's ceremony for her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the summer of 2018, he wasn't by her side in September when she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie for her role in When They See Us.</p>

<p>Niecy was also previously married to Don Nash from 1994 to 2007. </p>

<p>Happier days: Dividing assets: Her last marriage was to Jay Tucker; they wed in 2011 (pictured together September 2016). Niecy and Jay reportedly had issues over her role in Claws; seen in 2018 at the  NAACP Image Awards at Pasadena Civic Auditorium</p>
