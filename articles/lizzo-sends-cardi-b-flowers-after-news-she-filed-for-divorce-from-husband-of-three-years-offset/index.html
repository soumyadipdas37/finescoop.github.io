        <p>Lizzo supported friend and fellow musical artist Cardi B after the bombshell news the WAP songstress is divorcing husband of three-years Offset emerged Tuesday.</p>

<p>Cardi shared how the Truth Hurts singer reached out in a quick clip on her Instagram Story, posting video of flowers and sweet note she was sent.</p>

<p>'Isn't Lizzo the nicest person in the world?' the I Like It rapper, 27, told fans as she showed off the fresh bundle of blooms. </p>

<p>There for her: Lizzo supported friend and fellow musical artist Cardi B after the bombshell news the WAP songstress is divorcing husband of three-years Offset. The couple are seen in January 2020</p>

<p>'Look what she sent me!' Cardi squealed.</p>

<p>She was truly touched by the gift, telling fans Lizzo 'is just a beautiful a** person. I just love her, so much.' </p>

<p>The Juice artist's message to Cardi celebrated her accomplishments instead of wasting time on drama.</p>

<p>'Flowers for a flower!' it read. 'Congrats on all of your successes this summer—know you are loved and are love.' </p>

<p>The singer - full name Melissa Viviane Jefferson - promised another treat for Cardi soon, adding: 'P.S. I'm sending you something good this week. Love, Lizzo!'</p>

<p>Touched: 'Isn't Lizzo the nicest person in the world?' the I Like It rapper, 27, told fans as she showed off the fresh bundle of blooms</p>

<p>Sending love: She was truly touched by the gift, telling fans Lizzo 'is just a beautiful a** person. I just love her, so much' </p>

<p>So kind: 'Flowers for a flower!' it read. 'Congrats on all of your successes this summer—know you are loved and are love'</p>

<p>Though Cardi and Lizzo have yet to collaborate on music, both were featured as dancers in Hustlers.</p>

<p>The Bodak Yellow songstress also recently revealed she wanted Lizzo to be in her racy WAP music video but their schedules just didn't match up. </p>

<p>Lizzo has been keen on supporting the women on her industry. </p>

<p>In July she also reached out to Megan Thee Stallion with love after she was shot in both feet, allegedly during an argument with Canadian rapper Tory Lanez.</p>

<p>Details about Cardi and Offset's divorce emerged after TMZ obtained documents filed in Superior Court, Fulton County, Georgia on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Shock split: Cardi B filed for divorce from her rapper husband Offset after just three years of marriage, amid claims he cheated throughout their entire relationship. They are seen in December 2019 above</p>

<p>Cardi, 27, married the hitmaker, 28, in a secret ceremony in 2017 and they share daughter Kulture, two.</p>

<p>In the documents Cardi - real name Belcalis Almanzar - said the relationship was 'irretrievably broken' amid claims he 'cheated throughout the relationship.'  </p>

<p>Offset's infidelity appears to have been the breaking point as a source told People: 'Offset has pretty much cheated the entire time but Cardi looked the other way because of the baby. She also didn't want to be embarrassed. But she's had enough.'</p>

<p>The court documents state that 'there are no prospects for a reconciliation' and that the relationship is 'irretrievably broken.'</p>

<p>Divorce: Cardi, 27, married the hitmaker, 28, in a secret ceremony in 2017 and they share two-year-old daughter Kulture, however their doomed romance is now over as it has been claimed that he 'pretty much' cheated throughout the marriage (the couple are pictured at their daughter's second birthday party)</p>

<p>However, the documents add that Cardi hopes the divorce 'will be settled by agreement of the parties', according to E! News.</p>

<p>News of the split was first reported by Hollywood Unlocked.  </p>

<p>As well as details of the alleged infidelity, in Cardi's divorce filing, she stated she 'is seeking primary physical custody as well as legal custody' of the couple's child.  </p>

<p>New reports have claimed she is softening her approach to seek a joint custody agreement. </p>

<p>The Bronx-born recording artist is also seeking child support, although TMZ states the exact amount is unclear. </p>

<p>Tried to make it work: Her husband's infidelity appears to have been the breaking point for the female rapper. A source told People Tuesday: 'Offset has pretty much cheated the entire time but Cardi looked the other way because of the baby'</p>

<p>With the incredible success of her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy, Cardi's assumed net worth is around $24 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, while 28-year-old Offset's fortune is estimated at $26 million.  </p>

<p>Despite what appeared to be an amorous relationship on social media, Offset's last appearance on his wife's Instagram was on August 20 when she shared a clip from his video, Need It. </p>

<p>Cardi previously accused Offset of infidelity in 2018 just five months after the birth of their daughter. </p>

<p>After she declared they 'grew out of love' and were 'not together anymore, Offset publicly pleaded with her to give him another chance. </p>

<p>In a lengthy post on his Instagram, he wrote: 'We're going through a lot of things right now, a lot of things in the media. I want to apologize to you Cardi. I embarrassed you. I made you go crazy.'</p>

<p>Drama: Cardi previously accused Offset of infidelity in 2018. After she declared they 'grew out of love' and were 'not together anymore, he publicly pleaded with her to give him another chance (pictured November 2018)</p>

<p>Sorry: In December 2018, Offset (pictured in January) declared on Instagram: 'I was partaking in activity that I shouldn't have been partaking in, and I apologize.... For breaking your heart, for breaking our promise, for breaking God's promise and being a selfish, messed up husband'</p>

<p>He went on: 'I was partaking in activity that I shouldn't have been partaking in, and I apologize. You know what I'm saying? For breaking your heart, for breaking our promise, for breaking God's promise and being a selfish, messed up husband.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I'm trying to be a better person..... I apologize to you Cardi. I love you.' </p>

<p>Offset, who's real name is Kiari Kendrell Cephus, has three children with other women: Kalea Marie Cephus, Kody Cephus and Jordan Cephus. </p>

<p>Cardi's divorce filings indicate that she and Offset have been living separately for some time.</p>

<p>The rapper also requested that Offset cover all of her attorney fees and legal costs throughout the divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>The two apparently don't have a prenuptial agreement, so Cardi is requesting that all assets earned during their marriage be split, as well as any debts accrued during that time.</p>

<p>July 10, 2018: Cardi reveals on Instagram that she has welcomed a daughter called Kulture Kiari Cephus. </p>

<p>September 20, 2018: The star confirmed she married Offset on September 20, 2017, where she wore a tracksuit during the nuptials </p>

<p>December 5, 2018: Cardi announces that she has 'fallen out of love' with the rapper. In a video on Instagram, she detailed: 'It’s nobody fault, it’s just like, I guess we just grew out of love but we are not together anymore.'</p>

<p>December 15, 2018: Offset reaches out to his ex, writing: 'I know I embarrassed you. I was partaking in activity I shouldn’t have been taking in'. He then took to the stage during her appearance at a festival to beg her forgiveness. She said: 'I get that he’s trying. It’s hard.

<p>December 2019: Cardi discusses forgiving the rapper, saying: 'When me and my husband got into our issues—you know, he cheated and everything—and I decided to stay with him and work together with him, a lot of people were so mad at me; a lot of women felt disappointed in me. </p>

<p>'But it’s real-life s**t. If you love somebody and you stop being with them and you’re depressed and social media is telling you not to talk to that person because he cheated, you’re not really happy on the inside until you have the conversation. Then if you get back with them, it’s like, how could you? You let all of us down. People that be in marriages for years, when they say till death do us part, they not talking about little arguments like if you leave the fridge open. That’s including everything'.</p>

<p>May 11, 2020: The couple mark Mother's Day on social media. He gifts her two Birkin handbags.</p>
