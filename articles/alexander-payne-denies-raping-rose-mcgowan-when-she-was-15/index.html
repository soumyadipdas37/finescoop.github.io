    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Filmmaker Alexander Payne has denied allegations that he 'groomed' and sexually assaulted actress Rose McGowan when she was just 15 years old. </p>

<p>Instead, Payne insists that he and McGowan first crossed paths when she was 18 years old and that she asked him out on a date after she failed an audition for his first directorial gig. </p>

<p>The acclaimed director broke his silence on Friday - three weeks after McGowan accused him of ‘grooming’ her and having sex with her when she was underage and he was 28 years old.</p>

<p>Payne released a statement to Deadline in which denies the allegations.</p>

<p>‘Rose is mistaken in saying we met when she was fifteen, in the late 1980s,’ Payne wrote.</p>

<p>‘I was a full-time film student at UCLA from 1984 until 1990, and I know that our paths never crossed.’</p>

<p>Alexander Payne (left), 59, the Oscar-winning director, has denied claims by Rose McGowan (right), 46, that he raped the actress when she was just 15 years old</p>

<p>In a social media post from last month, McGowan named Payne as the ‘well-endowed’ man who allegedly 'sat me down and played a soft-core porn movie' when she was 15 - an incident she first described in 2018 without identifying Payne.</p>

<p>'If you are out there trying to have sex with an underage minor, you are committing a crime, even if the minor doesn't know it,' McGowan wrote in the August 18 'bomb of truth' post on Instagram.</p>

<p>‘I was attracted to him, so I thought it was on me, but that's not correct. I was not an adult.'</p>

<p>But Payne countered on Friday that McGowan has her facts wrong.</p>

<p>‘She claims that I showed her a “soft-core porn movie” I had directed for Showtime “under a different name”,’ Payne writes.</p>

<p>‘This would have been impossible, since I had never directed anything professionally, lurid or otherwise.</p>

<p>‘I have also never worked for Showtime or directed under any name other than my own.’</p>

<p>Payne then recalled the first time he and McGowan met and then briefly dated, though he notes that by this time she was of legal age.</p>

<p>McGowan made her allegations against Payne in a second 'bomb of truth' Instagram post on August 18, having earlier named him on Twitter </p>

<p>He writes: ‘Rose and I did meet years later, in 1991, during my first directing job, when she auditioned for a comic short I was making for a Playboy Channel series.</p>

<p>‘Although she did not get the part, she left a note for me at the casting desk asking that I call her.</p>

<p>‘I had no reason to question how old she was, since the role she read for required an actor who was of age.</p>

<p>Alexander Payne was born in Omaha in 1961 to his restaurant owning parents Peggy and George.  </p>

<p>Payne co-wrote and directed the critically acclaimed films 'Citizen Ruth,' 'Election,' 'About Schmidt,' 'Sideways' and 'The Descendants.' He also directed the 2013 film 'Nebraska' and the recent sci-fi satire 'Downsizing.'</p>

<p>He has been nominated for seven Academy Awards and won two Oscars for best adapted screenplay for 'Sideways' and 'The Descendants.'</p>

<p>'Sideways' also won a Golden Globe award for best motion picture-musical or comedy in 2004.</p>

<p>Payne graduated from Creighton Prep in Omaha and earned a bachelor's degree from Stanford University and a master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. </p>

<p>A third-generation Greek-American Payne married second wife Maria Kontos in 2015. The couple have one child, born in 2017. </p>

<p>He was previously married to Killing Eve star Sandra Oh for two years. The couple separated in 2005. </p>

<p>In 2018 he received an honorary doctorate degree in fine arts from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. </p>

<p>‘We later went out on a couple of dates and remained on friendly terms for years.’</p>

<p>Payne continued: ‘While I cannot allow false statements about events twenty-nine years ago to go uncorrected, I will continue to wish only the best for Rose.’</p>

<p>When asked to respond to Payne's denial on Friday, McGowan told Variety: 'F*** him and his lies is my comment.' </p>

<p>Before Friday, Payne, who co-wrote and directed the critically acclaimed films 'Citizen Ruth,' 'Election,' 'About Schmidt,' 'Sideways' and 'The Descendants', had yet to comment on the allegations. </p>

<p>McGowan - a pioneer of the #MeToo movement who was one of the first women to come forward against Harvey Weinstein - said the alleged ordeal led her to quit acting before she returned to Hollywood after being 'discovered' at age 21.   </p>

<p>McGowan told Variety 'it was time' to name Payne after telling Ronan Farrow in 2018 she had been the victim of a man who 'picked me up when I was 15 years old'.</p>

<p>McGowan had made her first allegation on Twitter on August 17, asking for an 'acknowledgement and an apology' from the director. </p>

<p>'Alexander Payne. You sat me down and played a soft-core porn movie you directed for Showtime under a different name,' she said. </p>

<p>'I still remember your apartment in Silverlake. You are very well-endowed. You left me on a street corner afterwards. I was 15.'</p>

<p>She also tweeted a picture of herself at age 15, saying: 'I just want an acknowledgement and an apology. I do not want to destroy.' </p>

<p>Later that same day, McGowan followed up with a longer Instagram post in which she described the alleged 'grooming'.  </p>

<p>'For years I had thought a man I had sexual relations with was a a sexual experience I had. I now know I was groomed,' she said. </p>

<p>'I auditioned for him at 15. After my experience with him, I quit acting entirely until I was "discovered" at 21. </p>

<p>'When that happened, I was like, f*** it, let's do this. I even tweeted a congratulations on his Oscar win in 2012, that's how deep in the Cult of Hollywood I was. </p>

<p>'It wasn't until three weeks after the Weinstein story broke that I re-evaluated the situation.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I feel badly about throwing a bomb into someone's life and career, but I guess that's social conditioning.</p>

<p>'I'm more sad than angry. Sad for 15 year-old me. Sad for the adult me that still thought it was a choice I made. </p>

<p>'Grooming is real. I want you all to know that it's not your fault if you were mentally massaged into thinking it's okay. It is not. I know this now. </p>

<p>'I would even go up to this director at events and ask him, with a smile, 'remember when you had sex with me at 15?' And I would laugh it off. That is deep societal programming. </p>

<p>'When it happened, I'd recently been left behind in Hollywood by a family member to fend for myself. The wolves preyed. </p>

<p>'Please recognize that if this has happened to you, the shame is not yours, it's theirs. Give it back. Groomers are skilled operators and at 15, I was not aware of the warning signs.'</p>

<p>She concluded: 'Goddess bless us all, except for those that abuse their power. Here's to freedom, yours and mine.'   </p>

<p>The actress, 46, took to Twitter on August 17 to make allegations that the Oscar-winning director, 59, was 'very well-endowed' and had 'left her on a street corner' after showing her the pornographic material</p>

<p>McGowan then posted a black and white headshot of herself as a teenager, adding: 'I just want an acknowledgement and an apology. I do not want to destroy. This was me at 15.'</p>

<p>Payne and wife Maria Kontos attending a screening in Los Angeles in 2017.</p>

<p>Payne was previously married to Killing Eve star Sandra Oh for two years. The couple separated in 2005</p>

<p>Payne subsequently rose to fame for movies such as Sideways (2004), Election (1999) and About Schmidt (2002). </p>

<p>It was reported in December last year that Payne was set to direct a remake of Babette’s Feast. It is not known where these allegations leave the project. </p>

<p>McGowan was an early face of the #MeToo movement in the fall of 2017 after she accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her. </p>

<p>In January 2018, she gave some details of the Payne allegation - but without identifying the director by name. </p>

<p>Speaking to Ronan Farrow, she said she had been the victim of a man who 'picked me up when I was 15 years old'. </p>

<p>'He took he home after he met me and he showed me a soft-porn movie he'd made for Showtime under a different name,' she said at the time. </p>

<p>'And then he had sex with me and then he left me next to Cafe Tropicale in Silverlake standing on a street corner.' </p>

<p>McGowan hinted at the time that she would reveal the director's name when she was ready, having previously given the name to Farrow.   </p>

<h1>MeToo movement: McGowan, 46, who was one of the leading activists of the global movement and accused Harvey Weinstein of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s, has now shared that she is 'in a good place' following his conviction (pictured together in 2007) </h1>
