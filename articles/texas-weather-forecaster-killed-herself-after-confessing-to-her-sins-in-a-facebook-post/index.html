        <p>A Texas TV weather forecaster took her own life moments after she confessed to her 'sins' in a heartbreaking Facebook post, her colleague has revealed.   </p>

<p>Kelly Plasker, a reporter with NBC affiliate KCBD 11 in Lubbock, died on Sunday at the age of 42, the station said.   </p>

<p>In a lengthy Facebook post earlier in the day, Plasker shared a 'final confession for the sins I am responsible for' and claimed that she had a five-year relationship with a teacher who groomed her when she was in high school.  </p>

<p>'My brain is broken and I cannot take it anymore,' she wrote. </p>

<p>Plasker's colleague Karin McKay paid tribute the weekend forecaster on the air on Monday night, describing how she had lost her son to suicide in 2018 and never recovered.  </p>

<p>'What you couldn't see on TV was a broken heart,' McKay told viewers. 'I remember one day two years ago when she and I sat and talked in the studio and she told me her world would never be the same.' </p>

<p>TV weather forecaster Kelly Plasker (pictured) took her own life on Sunday moments after she confessed to her 'sins' in a heartbreaking Facebook post, her colleague has revealed</p>

<p>In a Facebook post, Plasker shared a 'final confession for the sins I am responsible for' and claimed a teacher her groomed her for a five-year relationship when she was in high school</p>

<p>Plasker's colleague Karin McKay (pictured) paid tribute the weekend forecaster on the air on Monday night, describing how she had lost her son to suicide in 2018 and never recovered</p>

<p>'She said: "He was 19 years old, two weeks away from turning 20." Kelly was referring to her son, Thomas, who took his life in February of 2018,' McKay said. </p>

<p>The station then played a clip of Plasker speaking about her son months after his death in an interview with KCBD in June 2018. </p>

<p>In the clip the mother says through tears: 'With somebody in the house, he still felt so alone that he made that choice. It's very difficult for those of us who knew him to comprehend why.' </p>

<p>In the same interview, Plasker spoke about how she hoped other families can avoid the suffering altogether and prevent suicide by talking about it.</p>

<p>She said that she'd talked to her younger son about it, telling him: 'Please don't do this.' </p>

<p>Continuing her tribute, McKay said: 'Now, this weekend, our sweet Kelly took her own life, a cry for help that she made very public on her Facebook page.'</p>

<p>She described Plasker as 'a bright spot in our weekend mornings, arguably the prettiest on our First Alert Forecast team'.</p>

<p>'Kelly Plasker had a passion for sharing the forecast and keeping us safe... in more ways than just the weather,' McKay said. </p>

<p>She concluded the tribute by saying: 'The KCBD family extends our sympathy to Kelly Plasker's family. But we also express our gratitude for the time we shared with Kelly, someone who always brought joy to the newsroom.'  </p>

<p>In a statement, KCBD Vice President Dan Jackson said: 'We are deeply saddened by the tragic and sudden loss of KCBD weekend morning forecaster Kelly Plasker. </p>

<p>'Kelly was a dedicated member of the KCBD weather staff, well-liked by viewers, and admired by her co-workers. </p>

<p>'Our deepest sympathies go out to Kelly's family in this time of great loss.</p>

<p>'We would like to thank the many viewers who have reached out through our social media channels in kindness and support to honor Kelly's memory. </p>

<p>'Grief counselors have been made available to all members of the KCBD family struggling with this heartbreaking news.' </p>

<p> Plasker's death came two and a half years after her son Thomas (above together) died by suicide</p>

<p>Plasker described her grief over her son's suicide in an interview in June 2018 (pictured). 'With somebody in the house, he still felt so alone that he made that choice. It's very difficult for those of us who knew him to comprehend why,' she said through tears</p>

<p>The Facebook post Kelly published on the day of her death talked about her high school band director who she claimed was a predator.</p>

<p>'I got thrown off course in high school by a man twice my age. My band director, using his time at Frenship high school to find his new "soul mate!"' she wrote.</p>

<p>'He was supposed to be somebody looking out for me, but instead of looking out for me he looked at me in ways that men should not look at children.￼ And I realize now that predators pick off easy prey. Particularly those without much family support or resources.'</p>

<p>She described how teacher's 'grooming, abuse and manipulation' affected the relationships she had later in life and said she had been 'convinced that I wasn't worthy, that I was never going to be good enough for anybody'. </p>

<p>'He snuffed out my future and my ambitions in the most influential time of my life, my prime when I had so many doors and opportunities to explore,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Plasker also alleged that the teacher groomed another student, and said she's spoke to other woman with similar stories. </p>

<p>'Thanks all I needed to get out there as my final confession for the sins I am responsible for adding to the cross,' she wrote.  </p>

<p>'I love you my friends. My brain is broken and I cannot take it anymore.' </p>

<p>McKay described Plasker as 'a bright spot in our weekend mornings, arguably the prettiest on our First Alert Forecast team'. Plasker is pictured in a weather segment </p>

<p>KCBD did not report the circumstances surrounding Kelly's death in its first announcement Sunday night, but anchor Kase Wilbanks hinted that she took her own life by mentioning National Suicide Prevention.</p>

<p>He told viewers: 'Experts say stopping suicide means increasing the conversations about mental and emotional health.</p>

<p>'They say to reach out for help, so ask for help if you’re struggling or have had thoughts of suicide. Everyone should educate themselves on warning signs for those we love.'</p>

<p>Wes Nessman, a host for Lubbock's FMX 94.4 rock radio station and friend of Plasker, said she was in 'great spirits' the last time he talked to her.  </p>

<p>But he said: 'The last time she texted, I thought she was having physical problems.' </p>

<p>Nessman said that Plasker's passing was still too raw for him to speak more personally but did say that they had made each other laugh for years and he wished they had had a few more years of laughter.    </p>

<p>Other people took to Twitter to pay tribute to Kelly.</p>

<p>Lauren Linahan of WTVM said: 'My heart is heavy. Thinking of Kelly Plasker’s family, friends, and coworkers tonight.'</p>

<p>Bryanna Gallagher of Fox23 provided details for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline and tweeted: 'Heartbreaking, my thoughts &amp; prayers are with her family during this extremely difficult time.'</p>

<p>WKRN's Elizabeth Lane tweeted: 'Kelly Plasker was a staple in Lubbock and will be missed. So sad to hear this news and for the @KCBD11 family.'</p>

<p>While WJHL's Sydney Kessler said in a tweet: 'It’s hard to lose such an amazing friend. Kelly Plasker, I’m missing you more and more every minute. You were the best co-worker, work wife &amp; friend a girl could ask for. I love you so much and I’ll always wish I would have done more. #SuicideSucks.' </p>

<p>Tributes were paid on Twitter by other people, with condolences being paid to her family and her co-workers at KCBD11</p>
