        <p>Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump attended an outdoor service celebrating Rosh Hashanah with their family, including Joshua Kushner and Karlie Kloss, on Sunday. </p>

<p>The Kushner's continued their brief getaway from Capitol Hill, where warring over the Supreme Court Justice vacancy raged on, and observed the Jewish New Year surrounded by family.  </p>

<p>Just the day before, Jared was spotted helping an older gentleman who accidentally fell while strolling with his father, one of his sons and later Ivanka.</p>

<p>Photos obtained by DailyMail.com showed the Kushner sons and their families returning to their parent's opulent home in Long Branch, New Jersey, after the religious service.</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump  (center), pictured with one of her young sons (left) was spotted returning to the massive Kushner family home in Long Branch, New Jersey, on Sunday</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump (left) and her daughter, Arabella Kushner (right), donned face masks as they spoke to each other after a service celebrating Rosh Hashanah on Sunday</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump (left) converted to Judaism in 2009 after marrying Jared Kushner (right), who was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family in New Jersey</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump (left), pictured with Arabella and one of her sons, arrived in New Jersey from New York City after campaigning for her father's reelection </p>

<p>Ivanka, Advisor to the President and President Trump's first daughter, donned all black as she escorted her children into the home.</p>

<p>The black overcoat flowed in the cool breeze as Ivanka, 38, walked beside her daughter, Arabella, and one of her two young sons into the grand front doors. </p>

<p>Jared, 39, Senior Advisor to the President, was briefly seen wearing a similar dark overcoat and what appeared to be a kippah, or yarmulke. </p>

<p>Large SUV's courtesy of the United States Secret Service assigned to the family lined the driveway outside the illustrious home. </p>

<p>Rosh Hashanah is a Jewish New Year festival that began Friday and  will continue until through Sunday.</p>

<p>Also photographed at the Charles and Seryl Kushner's home was their youngest son, Joshua Kushner, and his wife Karlie Kloss. </p>

<p>Joshua Kushner (left) also returned to his parent's New Jersey home on Sunday to celebrate Rosh Hashanah with his wife, model and philanthropist Karlie Kloss</p>

<p>Joshua Kushner to Vogue: 'It is no secret that liberal values have guided my life and that I have supported political leaders that share similar values'</p>

<p>Despite Ivanka and Jared being key member of the Trump administration, both Joshua and Karlie have said they're more liberal and aligned with progressive ideologies </p>

<p>Pictured: Large SUV's courtesy of the United States Secret Service assigned to the family lined the driveway outside the illustrious home</p>

<p>Joshua, an businessman and investor, was dressed in a dark gray suit with a blue face mask while Kloss, 28, trailed behind in a tan overcoat.</p>

<p>The couple, who married in October 2018, have been known for the stark political stance against the Trump administration.</p>

<p>In a 2017 interview with Forbes, Joshua laid bare his liberal ideologies and acknowledged that they differed from his family's.</p>

<p>'It is no secret that liberal values have guided my life and that I have supported political leaders that share similar values,' he told the publication.</p>

<p> 'But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country. It's important to be open minded and learn from differing opinions.'</p>

<p>Photos taken by DailyMail.com showed Senior Advisor Jared Kushner (center) helping up a man who fell on a walkway in Long Beach, New Jersey, on Saturday</p>

<p>Jared Kushner (center) was spotted walking with his father, Charles Kushner (right), and one of his sons (left) along a Long Beach shoreline on Saturday</p>

<p>And Karlie Kloss, a model known for her noted for her Hollywood friendships, has said publicly that she will not vote for Trump in the upcoming November election. </p>

<p>In fact, she joined Biden and Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani for an event promoting girls and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics).</p>

<p>On Saturday, Kushner wore a ball cap, a black sweater and sweatpants as he strolled with his father, Charles, through Long Branch Township. </p>

<p>One of his sons rolled alongside the men on scooter, while personnel with the United States Secret Service trailed nearby.</p>

<p>Neither Kushner (center) nor anybody else on the weekend stroll wore Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face coverings as the pandemic continues</p>

<p>During their walk along the bay, a man stumbles and fell to the sidewalk and appeared to need assistance. </p>

<p>Luckily, the Senior Advisor to President Trump rushed over and kindly checked to see if he was okay. </p>

<p>Kushner could be seen helping the man to his feet as the rest of the family stood nearby. </p>

<p>During the Kushner family's Friday stroll, none of them appeared to don CDC recommended face masks during their walk through Long Beach, which is nestled in Ocean County. The county has recorded at 12,160 confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 1,050 deaths. </p>

<p>The Ocean County Health Department extended their beach seasons into early fall this year, but cautioned locals and visitors against flouting health guidelines.</p>

<p>'We certainly want our residents and visitors to enjoy this beautiful resource, but the pandemic isn’t over, and we need everyone to do their part in mitigating the transmission of the COVID-19 virus by adhering to all the social distancing measures and by wearing a mask when appropriate,' said Ocean County Freeholder Gerry P. Little in a statement. </p>

<p>Jared was joined on the stroll by his notorious father Charles Kushner, who was jailed for 14 months in 2005 for after a sensational trial that saw the millionaire real estate developer plead guilty to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations.</p>

<p>At the center of the trial was the revelation that Charles had hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, who at the time was cooperating with federal officials in an investigation into possible campaign finance violations committed by Charles. Charles then filmed the encounter between his brother-in-law and the woman, who was paid $10,000.</p>

<p>In photos taken later on Saturday, Kushner reappeared at the same beach side walkway with his wife, Ivanka, after his father and son returned home.</p>

<p>Ivanka, Advisor to the President and his oldest daughter, dressed near identical to her husband as the couple chatted.</p>

<p>At one point, the Kushner's deviated from the path and decided to take their shoes off for a detour in the sand.</p>

<p>Neither of them wore face masks while on the walkway, but 38-year-old Ivanka slipped one on while on the beach. </p>

<p>Later on Saturday, Ivanka Trump (left) joined Kushner (right) for a second stroll along a walkway in Long Beach, New Jersey, on Saturday</p>

<p>The couple's visit to the Kushner home comes amid Rosh Hashanah, a Jewish New Year festival that began Friday and celebrations will continue until through Sunday. Pictured: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner</p>

<p> Ivanka converted to Judaism in 2009 after marrying Kushner  who was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family. </p>

<p>In an interview with Vogue in 2015, Ivanka opened up about the conversion and called it 'such a personal thing.'</p>

<p>'We’re pretty observant, more than some, less than others. I just feel like it’s such an intimate thing for us,' she told Vogue.</p>

<p>'It’s been such a great life decision for me. I am very modern, but I’m also a very traditional person, and I think that’s an interesting juxtaposition in how I was raised as well.</p>

<p>'I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity. </p>
