        <p>Giant queues formed outside Costco stores today as panic-buyers raced to bulk-buy essentials like toilet roll and tinned goods on the day tighter coronavirus restrictions were announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>

<p>Supermarket shelves aross Britain have been emptied of pasta, rice and flour as desperate Britons prepare to hunker down at home for a second lockdown. </p>

<p>It comes as the Prime Minister made a speech in the House of Commons announcing tightened coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>The frenzied buying has echoes of the empty shelves seen in March as shoppers stocked up on essential items ahead of the first nationwide lockdown</p>

<p>This shopper's car was packed with loo roll as she prepared to depart the Costco store in Leeds this morning</p>

<p>An industrial trolley was needed for this massive haul of toilet tissue at the Leeds Costco superstore first thing today</p>

<p>These Manchester customers left Costco with stacks of loo roll as it emerged stocks of other essential items like pasta, flour and tinned goods are also selling fast</p>

<p>Two trollies were needed to carry this shoppers purchases as they were seen loading it in to the back of their car in Leeds</p>

<p>As customers flooded social media with pictures of empty aisles, one shopper declared: 'It's happening again' (pictured: Costco customer in Manchester)</p>

<p>This shopper did not appear to have brought any groceries on his visit to the Leeds Costco store, instead choosing to stock up on loo roll amid fears of panic-buying</p>

<p>His announcement comes after Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said yesterday the UK could hit 50,000 cases a day by mid-October and 200 plus daily deaths by November unless Britain changes course. </p>

<p>The new restrictions, announced by Boris Johnson in a speech at the House of Commons, include:</p>

<p>Amid growing concern that a second lockdown is on the way, shoppers have been emptying supermarket shelves of essential items.   </p>

<p>Toilet rolls, frozen food and long-life produce was wiped from the shelves in some stores in scenes familiar to March before lockdown was announced.</p>

<p>Wholesale shop Costco was inundated with customers with stores in Leeds, London and Manchester seeing a surge in visitors. </p>

<p>Many stores had to erect barriers to regulate the growing queues, and shoppers were seen leaving with overflowing trollies as they stocked up on supplies. </p>

<p>As customers flooded social media with pictures of empty aisles, one shopper declared: 'It's happening again.'</p>

<p>Another wrote on Twitter: 'Masks, toilet paper, pasta, flour, bread and fresh meat. Queues at supermarkets for the above and empty shelves.' </p>

<p>But shoppers have been urged to restrain themselves from panic-buying, with retailers insisting there is not need for it. </p>

<p>Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said yesterday: 'We urge consumers to be considerate of others and shop as they normally would.'</p>

<p>He played down the presence of panic-buying and paid tribute to the 'excellent job' of retailers to provide food during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Reassuring the public, he added: 'Supply chains are stronger than ever before and we do not anticipate any issues in the availability of food or other goods under any future lockdown.' </p>

<p>The toilet roll section at a supermarket in Ashford, Kent, was looking sparse today as shoppers cleared the shelves</p>

<p>The bulk packs of toilet tissue flew off the shelves of shops in Ashford, Kent, as customers across the country emptied supermarkets of essential items in the wake of Boris Johnson's speech this morning</p>

<p>The Prime Minister is set to address the nation tonight amid fears over a second lockdown, which sparked a surge in people buying toilet tissue just like in March before the first lockdown</p>

<p>Extra security was on hand to police the growing queues as shoppers waited to get inside the Chingford Costco in north London to pick up essential items</p>

<p>People could be seen wearing masks as they queued behind barriers outside the Chingford Costco in north London</p>

<p>The queues could be seen stretching into the car park in this north London branch of wholeale shop Costco</p>

<p>Loading up his car with loo roll and other shopping, a man at the Leeds Costco store is seen wearing a mask</p>

<p>Customers at Costco in Leeds stock up on toilet roll amid the fear that another national lockdown is on the way</p>

<p>But supermarkets are bolstering security at their doors and have doubled the number of delivery slots. </p>

<p>One supermarket worker in Birmingham told The Mirror: 'Some people are definitely panic buying again. We have 4,000 more items this weekend than we usually would. </p>

<p>'When the panic buying started months ago, we hadn't experienced it. We are prepared now.' </p>

<p>Another tweeted today: ' I just finished my shift at work and witnessed so many customers panic buying again. Please don’t - there is no need for it!' </p>

<p>It comes as Morrisons announced it will be reinstating marshals at its doors to limit the number of shoppers coming in and out, while also reminding them to wear face masks.</p>

<p>Shoppers have shared their concern on Twitter about fears of a second wave of coronavirus fuelling the return of panic-buying, which was seen at the beginning of the crisis in March</p>

<p>One person on Twitter recalled the first lockdown and how people started panic buying items around that time in March</p>

<p>Listing the most sought after essential items, this social media user reported empty shelves and long queues at shops</p>

<p>Branding panic buyers 'idiots' this person posted that they were informed of the panic buying by their Morrisons delivery man</p>

<p>Asda has increased its online delivery slots by 65 per cent - from 450,000 to 700,000, with Tesco also increasing their slots</p>

<p>Concerned shoppers took to Twitter over the weekend to share photographs of their local supermarkets, showing shelves completely emptied of essential items.</p>

<p>One Twitter user shared photographs of an ASDA in London where cereals seemed in short supply, leaving shoppers with fewer brands to choose from.</p>

<p>Another shopper posted pictures of a Tesco in the West Midlands, where kitchen roll and toilet roll was in short supply - but had not been completely cleared out.</p>

<p>Email tips@dailymail.com </p>

<p>One person shared pictures on Twitter, writing: 'This was my local Tesco! People are already panic buying once again! Even though supermarkets do stay open.' </p>

<p>An ASDA shopper said: 'This is our ASDA it's madness and as you say even though they are staying open.'</p>

<p>And another person predicted that 'It's happening again'.</p>

<p>Tesco's weekly ordering capacity has risen from 600,000 to 1.5million - but it remains fully booked until Wednesday.</p>

<p>Asda has increased its online delivery slots by 65 per cent - from 450,000 to 700,000.  </p>

<p>There are three-day waiting times for Ocado, while Sainsbury's is experiencing high demand. </p>

<p>Sainsbury's revealed the number of Christmas pudding searches was four times higher than this time last year.</p>

<p>The online supermarkets pasted notices on their 'pick a slot' page warning customers the sites were experiencing high demand.</p>

<p>Ocado's read: 'Delivery slots are selling out faster than usual. If you can't find a slot now, please use the 'Next 3 days' button to see available slots further in advance.' </p>

<p>A notice on Sainsbury's delivery slots page said: 'Slots are still in high demand. We have been working hard to expand our service.  More slots are now available and we are able to offer some of them to other customers. </p>

<p>'Customers who are vulnerable will get priority access and are able to book slots in advance of anyone else. We're releasing new slots regularly so please check back if you can't see any available.'</p>

<p>On Saturday, Tesco was fully booked until Wednesday with an available slots all priced at £5.50 - and there were no available spaces until Monday at Asda.</p>

<p>Crowds gathered as people queued to get into the large wholesale stores. Here cutomers at Costco in Leeds wait for entry</p>

<p>An overloaded trolley is pushed through the car park of a Costco store in Leeds as bulk-buying was seen at stores across the UK</p>

<p>One shopper in Leeds left Costco with at least 36 rolls of toilet roll, amid warnings from supermarkets not to bulk buy </p>

<p>These two men also stocked up on loo roll while shopping at the Leeds branch of Costco. The spate of bulk-buying comes ahead of Boris Johnson's speech later today, in which he is expected to announce tighter coronavirus restrictions</p>
