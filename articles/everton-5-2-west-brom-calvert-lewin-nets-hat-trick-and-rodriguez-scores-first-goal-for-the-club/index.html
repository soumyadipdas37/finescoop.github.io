        <p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first senior hat-trick helped Everton maintain their perfect start to the season against 10-man West Brom who also had manager Slaven Bilic dismissed for an outburst at referee Mike Dean.</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin was just one of several stories to emerge from an eventful lunchtime game that also saw Everton signing James Rodriguez score his first goal for the club and get involved in the incident that saw Albion's Kieran Gibbs sent off.</p>

<p>Everton have won all three of their games this season while newly-promoted West Brom are still looking for their first league point, but neither will have a more incident-packed match all season.</p>

<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin's hat-trick inspired Everton to a thumping win over West Brom</p>

<p>The striker's first came with a delightful backheel before adding two more in the second half </p>

<p>James Rodriguez also ran the show for Everton again with a superb display from midfield</p>

<p>West Brom were reduced to 10 before half time with Kieran Gibbs sent off for violent conduct</p>

<p>Everton (4-3-3): Pickford 6; Coleman 7, Mina 6.5, Keane 7, Digne 7; Doucoure 6 (Sigurdsson 65' 6), Allan 6, Andre Gomes 6; Rodriguez 7.5 (Kean 78' 6), Calvert-Lewin 9 (Iwobi 71'), Richarlison 8</p>

<p>Subs not used: Kenny, Bernard, Davies, Virginia</p>

<p>Booked: Doucoure</p>

<p>Goals: Calvert-Lewin 31', 62', 66', Rodriguez 45', Keane 54'</p>

<p>West Brom (5-4-1): Johnstone 6; Furlong 5, Ajayi 6, Bartley 5, O'Shea 5, Gibbs 4; Matheus Pereira 6.5 (Phillips 71' 6), Livermore 6, Sawyers 4 (Field 75' 6), Diangana 7 (Edwards 71' 6); Robinson 6</p>

<p>Subs not used: Robson-Kanu, Harper, Kipre, Button</p>

<p>Booked: None</p>

<p>Sent off: Gibbs </p>

<p>Goals: Diangana 10', Pereira 47'</p>

<p>Referee: Mike Dean 6</p>

<p>Early kick-offs are sometimes dull – but not this one. After Grady Diangana had fired Albion ahead, Everton hit back through Calvert-Lewin and Rodriguez before Gibbs was sent off on the stroke of half-time with Bilic then confronting Dean as the teams walked off at the interval.</p>

<p>Pereira then levelled for the visitors before Everton made the extra man count with further goals from Michael Keane and two more from Calvert-Lewin.</p>

<p>Ironically, West Brom made a lively start and were rewarded by taking a surprise lead after 10 minutes.</p>

<p>A mix-up between Everton's Andre Gomes and Rodriguez surrendered possession in Albion's half and the visitor's counter was lethal.</p>

<p>Pereira played a ball around the corner to Diangana and he sped from the halfway line before beating Jordan Pickford with a left-footed finish from the edge of the box.</p>

<p>It was Diangana's first West Brom goal since making his loan move from West Ham permanent, a £15million deal that had angered Hammers skipper Mark Noble and their supporters.</p>

<p>Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti cut a frustrated figure in the technical area and waved his arms around in frustration when Albion almost added a second goal – captain Jake Livermore striking the post.</p>

<p>But the home side were able to level after 31 minutes when Calvert-Lewin's clever backheel was allowed to stand after a lengthy VAR check.</p>

<p>Seamus Coleman created the chance with a dink to the far post but referee's assistant Darren Cann flagged because he believed Richarlison was offside flicking on to the scorer.</p>

<p>However, replays showed the decisive touch had come off the head of Albion defender Darnell Furlong allowing the goal to stand.</p>

<p>If the game was already lively, it exploded shortly before half-time.</p>

<p>First, Rodriguez netted his first Everton goal when he cleverly bent in Richarlison's pass with his trusted left foot from 18 yards.</p>

<p>West Brom boss Slaven Bilic was also sent off after he voiced his protests to Mike Dean</p>

<p>It all started with former West Ham forward Diangana scoring with an excellent left-foot strike</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin flicked home an equaliser with the help of VAR after offside had been given</p>

<p>Rodriguez then began to run the show and started finding further openings for Everton</p>

<p>The Colombian was then involved in further controversy when he gave Kieran Gibbs a shove by the touchline with the Albion defender lashing out in frustration and catching Rodriguez in the cheek with a raised arm.</p>

<p>Everton's former Real Madrid Galactico milked the clash by rolling around clutching his face but referee Dean saw little choice but to send off Gibbs.</p>

<p>The half-time whistle blew immediately and Bilic marched on to the pitch to argue furiously with Mr Dean about the decision, the Croatian finding himself given a red card.</p>

<p>Bilic initially would have enjoyed his view of the second half from the stands when Portuguese midfielder Pereira curled a brilliant free-kick past Pickford to make it 2-2.</p>

<p>And the Colombian star put the hosts into the lead with a fine low finish from outside the area</p>

<p>It got worse for West Brom as a clash between Rodriguez and Gibbs saw the latter see red</p>

<p>It proved a false dawn for the visitors however as Everton then proceeded to make their class tell against 10 men.</p>

<p>The important third goal arrived after 54 minutes when Lucas Digne's free-kick was headed goalwards by Richarlison.</p>

<p>Albion 'keeper Sam Johnstone, clad in pink, pushed the ball out but only to defender Michael Keane, who prodded home.</p>

<p>From then onwards, it was a romp with Calvert-Lewin following up his winner at Spurs on the opening day by claiming his first senior hat-trick.</p>

<p>Bilic walked over to Dean to voice his frustrations and was also sent off by the referee</p>

<p>West Brom rallied at the start of the second half through Matheus Pereira's brilliant free-kick</p>

<p>The centre-forward was a fox in the box to turn in Richarlison's cross-shot after 62 minutes after Rodriguez had again set up an Everton attack.</p>

<p>And four minutes later Calvert-Lewin was able to claim the match ball with a header from Rodriguez's centre before getting mobbed by delighted team-mates.</p>

<p>Everton could have had more with Digne hitting the crossbar. Calvert-Lewin was taken off with his job done and Albion also replaced their danger-men Pereira and Diangana with the contest over.</p>

<p>But the floodgates then opened as Michael Keane tapped home after Richarlison was denied</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin poked home a fourth and then completed a hat-trick with an effort off his back</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>The Premier League football comes thick and fast on what is a packed weekend of live action.</p>

<p>We're off to Elland Road next for Leeds United's first home Premier League game in 16 years as they take on fellow newly-promoted side Fulham.</p>

<p>Join my colleague SAM BLITZ for full coverage of that one by clicking the link below.</p>

<p>Thanks for joining me this afternoon.</p>

<p>In order to read Joe Bernstein's match report from Goodison Park, please refresh this page in a few minutes' time. </p>

<p>A thoroughly entertaining game to begin our Premier League weekend and it's two wins in two for Everton, who are the early Premier League leaders.</p>

<p>They fell behind early on here thanks to Grady Diangana but had recovered the situation before half-time. Dominic Calvert-Lewin equalised with the assistance of VAR before James Rodriguez opened his scoring account just before the break.</p>

<p>Then a moment of madness from Kieran Gibbs, who shoved James in the face and earned a straight red was followed by Slaven Bilic also being sent off for arguing with referee Mike Dean.</p>

<p>Remarkably, 10-man West Brom levelled just after the break thanks to Matheus Pereira's superlative free-kick but Everton's numerical advantage told in the end.</p>

<p>Michael Keane restored their lead at 3-2 before Calvert-Lewin completed his hat-trick with a couple of goals within the space of five minutes.</p>

<p>Another encouraging day for the Toffees.</p>

<p>The game slowing down a little but Everton still pushing for more goals. Sigurdsson with the long diagonal out to Digne, who crossed invitingly to Richarlison. </p>

<p>The Brazilian probably should have done better with the finish as it glances off his head and goes wide.</p>

<p>Plenty of speculation about the future of Moise Kean at Everton following what was a difficult first season.</p>

<p>He doesn't get too much game time and snatched at a shot that sat up nicely for him there, the ball flying wide.</p>

<p>Perhaps Kean will get more goals, however, in what is clearly a more creative Everton team this season. </p>

<p>3 - Dominic Calvert-Lewin (23y &amp; 187d) is the youngest Englishman to score a top-flight hat-trick for Everton since @TonyCottee9 (23y 47d) vs Newcastle in August 1988. Clinical. https://t.co/VRqrkqxAJ1</p>

<p>Another very good afternoon for James Rodriguez, who gets a lovely hug from Carlo Ancelotti as he is replaced by Moise Kean. </p>

<p>That was an emphatic a finish as you'll ever see, expertly dispatched by Richarlison into the top corner with a satisfying clunk of the goal frame. </p>

<p>But celebrations are cut short by an offside flag.</p>

<p>They've had a real examination today but Everton now cruising towards a second league victory of the season. </p>

<p>West Brom are a man light and starting to flag and you wouldn't be surprised if Everton find another goal or two to really continue the feel good factor here.</p>

<p>Sam Field comes on for Romaine Sawyers as we enter the final 15.</p>

<p>What a shame there isn't a crowd inside Goodison Park to applaud Dominic Calvert-Lewin off the field after that poacher's hat-trick today.</p>

<p>Alex Iwobi is the man to replace him as Richarlison moves into a central role.</p>

<p>West Brom will make a couple of changes now</p>

<p>Matheus Pereira taken off for Matt Phillips. </p>

<p>Grady Diangana going off as well for Kyle Edwards</p>

<p>It's three brilliant goals by Calvert-Lewin and his excellent scoring start to the season continues. </p>

<p>This one was simple enough, he improvised to duck down and header home another tempting corner kick, getting to the ball just ahead of Michael Keane.</p>

<p>A memorable day for the Everton striker and West Brom must really fear a hiding now. </p>

<p>Everton won a free-kick in a great position just before that sub and Lucas Digne steps up ahead of Sigurdsson to strike it and it takes a deflection to clip the top of the crossbar. So close!</p>

<p>The first sub of the afternoon - it's Doucoure replaced by Gylfi Sigurdsson as Everton go for more goals.</p>

<p>That was just down a sheer weight of numbers. Everton working the ball around on the edge of the West Brom box just waiting for the gaps to appear.</p>

<p>In the end, it was that magic left boot by James Rodriguez that made all the difference, a scooped ball over the top into Richarlison, who'd timed his run perfectly.</p>

<p>Richarlison's shot may well have been going in but Calvert-Lewin made sure.</p>

<p>And for the first time, Everton have some breathing space in this game. </p>

<p>This has been a superb start to the Premier League weekend.</p>

<p>All those who thought Everton would win it comfortably... West Brom have played their full part.</p>

<p>And they attack again, slicing through the Everton back line with Diangana and Robinson but the ball across the box is cut out by Mina just in time. </p>

<p>Ah, West Brom's bubble has been burst again.</p>

<p>No sooner had the 10 men equalised, they're behind once again. It was a simple set piece goal and Bilic, sat in the stands, will be fuming behind his face mask.</p>

<p>Delivered from the left side by Digne, Richarlison got the initial header that was blocked really well by Sam Johnstone. Nobody reacted for West Brom to the rebound and Keane was alert to tap it home from just a few yards out.</p>

<p>We have another twist here.</p>

<p>Brilliance from Pereira!The Brazilian has 10-man West Brom on level terms with a pinpoint freekick 🎯 pic.twitter.com/CRVcgLGdiG</p>

<p>WHAT A GOAL!</p>

<p>West Brom start the second half on the front foot and win a free-kick that must be between 30 and 35 yards from goal. </p>

<p>That doesn't faze Matheus Pereira in the slightest. He steps up and curls the most magnificent free-kick strike into the top corner, offering Pickford no chance.</p>

<p>It could not have been struck any better! Pereria continuing his magic from last season in the Premier League.</p>

<p>That'll cheer Bilic up, wherever he is.</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic's assistants continuing the debate with Mike Dean as the referee walks out for the second half. </p>

<p>Given all the Covid protocols, and the fact the away dressing room is out in the Goodison car park, is that why Bilic pursued the officials to have the discussion about that red card as they left the field? </p>

<p>That was quite a finale to what had been a really entertaining half anyway. </p>

<p>Having taken the lead early on, West Brom have fallen apart. Not only conceding twice to trail, but down to 10 men for the second half after that moment of stupidity by Kieran Gibbs. </p>

<p>And then Slaven Bilic seeing red as well as the teams went off the the break.</p>

<p>Oh goodness me, Slaven Bilic has not taken that Gibbs red card very well at all.</p>

<p>The half-time whistle blows and he pursued Mike Dean and his assistants off the field arguing it shouldn't have been a sending off.</p>

<p>'Check the foul, check the red card,' Bilic was saying. </p>

<p>Dean wasn't willing to have the argument, turned around and flashed the red card to Bilic. </p>

<p>It's all unravelled very quickly for West Brom here.</p>

<p>A goal and a red card to finish off the half, it's all gone wrong for West Brom!Slaven Bilic vents is frustrations at Mike Dean 😡 pic.twitter.com/JqHclWwgQ8</p>

<p>Well, that escalated quickly</p>

<p>James Rodriguez is off the mark! 🔵He finds the bottom corner to put Everton in front. pic.twitter.com/3dwMzGhBQp</p>

<p>Bad to worse for West Brom and that is absolute stupidity by Gibbs. </p>

<p>There's a little nudge off the ball as he came together with James Rodriguez close to the right touchline. </p>

<p>And Gibbs responded by raising his arms and shoving the Colombian in the face. James fell straight to the ground and Mike Dean had no hesitation in showing a straight red.</p>

<p>Joe Bernstein at Goodison Park: James Rodriguez was always going to make an impact at Everton. So far this lunchtime, he's blundered for West Brom's goal, scored a beauty himself to put his side 2-1 ahead and has now been taken out to get West Brom's Kieran Gibbs sent off. All you'd want and expect from a silky Real Mardid Galactico!</p>

<p>STAR QUALITY</p>

<p>A certain Colombian is off and running then in Everton colours and it's a cracking finish. </p>

<p>James received the ball about 20 yards from goal, one touch to push it into a shooting position followed by a sweet left-footed shot across keeper Johnstone and it nestled in the far corner.</p>

<p>Lovely finish. </p>

<p>More corners for Everton but nobody is able to get on the end of Digne's deep cross and West Brom clear their lines. They'll be pleased to get in at half time at 1-1.</p>

<p>Five minutes remaining of what has been a very watchable first half with chances - and a goal - for both sides.</p>

<p>Neat football by the visitors as they look to restore their lead. Allan dawdles on the ball and Callum Robinson almost nips in, only for Pickford to block. </p>

<p>And there is the leveller for Everton... with a little bit of VAR assistance. </p>

<p>A delivery from the right side by Seamus Coleman appeared initially to have been knocked down by Richarlison and fell to Calvert-Lewin, right in front of goal, and beyond the final defender.</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin finished with a cheeky backheel but the offside flag was raised.</p>

<p>However, Richarlison was insistent he hadn't touched the ball, instead it came off the defender to Calvert-Lewin.</p>

<p>Simon Hooper, the VAR official, checked the replays and confirmed it did touch the West Brom man and so Calvert-Lewin was played onside. The goal counts. We have parity. </p>

<p>Everton forcing a series of corners as they search for that equaliser. Lucas Digne swings it in, Michael Keane rises highest but can't steer his header on target.</p>

<p>Better from the home side though as Carlo Ancelotti waves his arms on the sideline.</p>

<p>A bit of spark from Everton at last - the pace of Richarlison driving a hole in the Baggies defence as he trades passes with Andre Gomes. Not the best shot from the Brazilian, however, as the ball skews wide.</p>

<p>West Brom absolutely brimming with confidence here. This is the free-flowing football of their promotion season last year on display.</p>

<p>Darnell Furlong with a great floated ball from the right side that Jake Livermore controls superbly, spinning and firing a shot that had Pickford beaten but cannons off the post.</p>

<p>Desperately unlucky not to be two goals ahead at least here.</p>

<p>That's much better from Jordan Pickford.</p>

<p>Inspired by Diangana earlier, Callum Robinson decides to take aim from just outside the box. It's a sweet strike and on target, with Pickford diving across to his right to push it away. </p>

<p>It's fair to say few predicted such a good start by the visitors. </p>

<p>Everton trying to respond to the shock of that early goal. </p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin with a sharp turn inside the box amid a crowd but his shot is blocked. </p>

<p>A minute or two later, Allan tries his luck with a low shot but it's easy enough for Sam Johnstone in goal for West Ham.</p>

<p>Joe Bernstein at Goodison Park: If Mark Noble was "gutted" to see Grady Diangana leave West Ham, he'll be absolutely livid now. The Albion winger has been the stand-out player at Goodison so far, not just the goal but his bravery to run at Everton's defence whenever he can</p>

<p>That's a superb individual goal - but why on earth did Everton's defenders back off him? </p>

<p>Diangana collected the ball about 10 yards inside his own half, advanced and advanced all the way to the edge of the Everton box with their players almost inviting him to hit it.</p>

<p>So he did and the ball has flown into the bottom corner - it's a lovely finish for Diangana's first Premier League goal. </p>

<p>Questions have to be asked of the defenders - and Pickford, whose positioning was hardly ideal. </p>

<p>That's the second sloppy clearance by Pickford of the opening few minutes. His defence have to cover to prevent West Brom capitalising. </p>

<p>A bright opening here and this time it's Everton's turn to threaten. Really they should be ahead and Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be disappointed.</p>

<p>They win a corner, it's floated nicely to the back post by James Rodriguez and the striker sees the ball skim off his head and go wide. </p>

<p>Not even 30 seconds on the clock and West Brom with the game's first chance.</p>

<p>Some slack defending and a poor clearance by Jordan Pickford allows the ball to fall nicely to Grady Diangana after Callum Robinson teed him up and whose low shot is clean connection but not powerful enough to beat Pickford.</p>

<p>We're off and running on Merseyside. Can Everton continue their encouraging start to the new season, or will West Brom thwart them and get their first points on the board? </p>

<p>Slaven Bilic greets Carlo Ancelotti and Duncan Ferguson on the touchline and we're underway. </p>

<p>The referee today is Mike Dean. </p>

<p>Time for some action, then. </p>

<p>No crowd inside Goodison Park, of course, but still a very real sense of anticipation as Everton's players, wearing some very smart white tracksuit tops, make their way out onto the pitch as the Z-Cars theme plays over the PA system. </p>

<p>They will start as heavy favourites to beat West Brom this afternoon as the Baggies, in their green and yellow striped away kits this afternoon, emerge from one corner of the ground. They have changed in what is a temporary dressing room in the Goodison car park. </p>

<p>Not too much longer to wait now until our Premier League Saturday gets started.</p>

<p>The two teams have returned to the dressing rooms at Goodison Park for their final preparations and will soon make their - socially distanced - entrance onto the pitch for the game.</p>

<p>Here's a reminder of the two starting line-ups for you: </p>

<p>Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Mina, Digne, Doucoure, Allan, Rodriguez, Gomes, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin</p>

<p>West Brom: Johnstone, O’Shea, Bartley, Ajayi, Furlong, Livermore, Sawyers, Gibbs, Diangana, Pereira, Robinson</p>

<p>Gareth Barry has high hopes for Everton's new-look midfield, with the former Toffee hopeful that star signing James Rodriguez will bring the best out of his new team-mates as they look to close the gap on the Premier League's top teams.</p>

<p>Carlo Ancelotti's side got off to a flyer in their season opener at Tottenham last weekend, with a Dominic Calvert-Lewin header enough to see off Jose Mourinho's side.</p>

<p>The Italian fielded Rodriguez, Allan and Abdoulaye Doucouré, who all joined the club this summer, and the trio impressed and offered hope for Everton fans that they can pose a threat to the Big Six.</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic would be 'extremely disappointed' if West Bromwich Albion fail to re-sign his key target Filip Krovinovic and urged the club board to find the funds to make the deal happen.</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed last month that Bilic was growing increasingly frustrated at Albion's work in the market and on Thursday he sent a clear message to his bosses about the importance of bringing in midfielder Krovinovic from Benfica.</p>

<p>Bilic's fellow Croatian made 43 appearances in all competitions as Albion were promoted to the Premier League last term and would like to return, yet the club have still not agreed terms with Benfica, who are believed to be seeking a loan fee with an obligation to buy at the end of the campaign.</p>

<p>Everton paid no transfer fee for James Rodriguez, a startling coup that has been revealed by Argentine club Banfield.</p>

<p>The Merseyside outfit pulled off the shock signing of the Real Madrid forward this summer, signing a two-year deal at Goodison Park.</p>

<p>It had been thought that Everton had paid as much as £20million to land the Colombia international, but it has now been claimed this is not the case.</p>

<p>Greetings one and all and welcome to our coverage of the second Premier League weekend of the season.</p>

<p>Once again, the games are spaced out and without overlap to allow for blanket television coverage with fans still unable to get back into grounds.</p>

<p>We begin at Goodison Park watching an Everton side creating quite a buzz following some exciting summer acquisitions, with optimism soaring after last Sunday's 1-0 win at Tottenham in their season opener. </p>

<p>Today, they host newly-promoted West Bromwich Albion, whose return to the top-flight started in ominous fashion with a 3-0 home loss to Leicester. They'll hope for better here.</p>

<p>Plenty of build-up ahead for what is a 12.30pm kick-off and we will bring you all the team news in a few minutes' time. </p>
