        <p>A student teacher who would spend $160-a-week on takeaway meals has revealed how she dropped four dress sizes - without depriving herself of all the 'naughty' food she loves.</p>

<p>Renee Roberts, from Sydney, lived off a McDonald's, KFC and takeaway-heavy diet - an unhealthy lifestyle that saw her weight spiralled to 105kg.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old said she would go through a 'vicious cycle' of dieting but would later find herself secretly eating a KFC Zinger box meal alone in her car before driving home just in time to enjoy a 'massive dinner with a side of chocolate'.</p>

<p>Determined to get on top of her weight once and for all, she shed 35 kilos within 12 months just by counting her macros rather than follow strict diets.</p>

<p>'This might come as a surprise... but I have been taught how to have your cake and eat it too,' Renee told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>Renee Roberts (pictured before and after) whose weight escalated after leading an unhealthy lifestyle has dropped four dress sizes without depriving herself of foods she loves</p>

<p>She shed 35 kilos within 12 months just by counting her macros rather than follow strict diets</p>

<p>She credits 'flexible dieting' for her size 10 physique where she eats 80 per cent wholefoods and 20 per cent of anything she wants - within reason.</p>

<p>Before her weight loss, the young woman - who wore size 18 clothing - actually stopped weighing herself after she saw the three digits on the scale.</p>

<p>'I was so ashamed and disappointed in myself that I decided to direct the blame to the scales,' she said.</p>

<p>'I thought that if I just stopped looking at the numbers, the problem would go away and it would stop the overwhelming upset that it caused me to feel.'</p>

<p>Renee said her biggest expenditure was takeaway meals.</p>

<p>'I was personally funding my Uber Eats drivers' new car by ordering takeaway a minimum of four times a week. I was spending an average of $160 a week plus buying my own groceries on top of it,' she said. </p>

<p>Her turning point to lose weight came after she realised she needed to opt for a size 20 after she couldn't fit into her favourite size 18 blue denim skirt</p>

<p>Before her weight loss, Renee said she had an 'extremely unhealthy lifestyle with poor eating habits to match' when she was at her heaviest weight of 105 kilos</p>

<p>She credits 'flexible dieting' for her size 10 physique where she eats 80 per cent wholefoods and 20 per cent of anything she wants, within reason</p>

<p>She tried every diet imaginable to lose weight - but nothing seemed to work. </p>

<p>'I was a yo-yo dieter, trying everything from Keto, to weight loss shakes, extreme restriction, eating clean with a cheat day and my personal favourite - only eating meat on Tuesdays and Thursdays,' she recalled. </p>

<p>'I was in this vicious cycle of dieting like a mad women for a week, then having an insane blow where I eat anything and everything I could get my hands on... before deciding to re-try next month.</p>

<p>'I was paying for a gym membership that I didn't use and going out eating and drinking with my friends twice a week.' </p>

<p>Renee said she became fixated with social media influencers.</p>

<p>'I would watch fitness and health YouTubers thinking that it would influence me but instead I would sit on my bed for hours on end watching them in envy as I sat there eating my takeaway and never committing to a change,' she said. </p>

<p>The 21-year-old (pictured with her boyfriend during her weight loss) said she believed her weight gain was 'ultimately caused by my sheer lack of control' </p>

<p>Determined to get on top of her weight once and for all, she shed 35 kilos within 12 months just by counting her macros rather than follow strict diets</p>

<p>It took her over a year to shed 35 kilos altogether - and lose a total of 81.9 cm all over her body</p>

<p>She believed her weight gain was caused by her 'sheer lack of control when it came to the amount of food I was consuming'. </p>

<p>'I remember days where I would eat no breakfast, binge out at lunch and say to myself that I would start my extremely restrictive diet tomorrow, drive into a KFC or a Maccas drive-thru after work and quickly eat it in the car before I got home and would then eat a massive dinner with a side of chocolates,' she said. </p>

<p>'This was a constant unhealthy cycle that I tried time and time again to break without success and due to this lack of success, I would get upset with myself and eat my feelings away.' </p>

<p>As she struggled with body image and self-confidence, Renee said she felt deterred from shopping for size-18 clothing.</p>

<p>'When I was at my biggest, I found it very hard to find clothes at my favourite shops as the largest size they'd stock would be a size 16,' she said.</p>

<p>'This resulted in me developing a hate for trying things on in store as I didn't want the people working in the change rooms to know I couldn't fit into the pieces I selected.</p>

<p>'Once I took them home and they fit, I would cut the tags off my clothes so people didn't see what size they were. </p>

<p>'Overall I feel like my body was a result of how I felt inside instead of the other way around, the way I looked definitely added to what I was feeling however I believe my heaviest weight reflected a time in my life where I was at my lowest.'</p>

<p>Since her weight loss, Renee said she feels happier about herself more than ever</p>

<p>The student teacher revealed she would spend $160-a-week on takeaway meals </p>

<p>But her turning point to lose weight came when she realised she needed to opt for a size 20 after she couldn't fit into her favourite size 18 blue denim skirt. </p>

<p>'I remember being late to pick up my boyfriend for the event we were going to because I simply just couldn't stop crying, it was like the realisation finally hit me in. The face like a truck and I knew that I needed to make a change,' she said. </p>

<p>'A fire started in my belly, determined to never ever feel that way and I started writing down all the things I wanted to change or incorporate into my life. The top of the list was to learn about food and the second was exercise.'</p>

<p>At first, she assumed weight loss programs were expensive but after going through her bank statements, she discovered the large amount of money she was spending on takeaway meals every week.</p>

<p>'I soon realised my problem was the fact that I wasn't prioritising my health,' she said.</p>

<p>'Not only was I wasting so much money on food each week, I was wasting so much time and energy being trapped in such a negative cycle.'</p>

<p>And so she turned to Equalution - a science-based nutrition program which involves meeting daily targets of macronutrients - protein, carbohydrate and fat - that have been calculated based on the dieter's age, gender, activity level and any condition.</p>

<p>'I have learnt so much about food and nutrition from the team that has helped me develop a positive relationship with food. Seeing food as fuel and energy instead of the enemy,' she said.</p>

<p>'I was learning how to count my macros. I didn't feel as I was eating less though. I was eating more if anything, just not as calorie dense.'</p>

<p>Determined to get on top of her weight once and for all, she shed 35 kilos within 12 months just by counting her macros rather than follow strict diets</p>

<p>Renee said she now enjoys six meals a day without restricting herself of her favourite food</p>

<p>BREAKFAST: Cafe-style avocado on toast with poached eggs</p>

<p>MORNING SNACK: Ham, lettuce, cream cheese and tomato toast</p>

<p>LUNCH: Beef ragu pasta</p>

<p>AFTERNOON SNACK: Frozen yoghurt with mixed berries</p>

<p>DINNER: Coconut crusted chicken with Asian veggie noodle salad</p>

<p>DESSERT: Classic Magnum ice cream</p>

<p>Total: 1,900 calories</p>

<p>It took her over a year to shed 35 kilos altogether - and lose a total of 81.9 cm all over her body. </p>

<p>'I currently weigh 70kg and am shocked to be buying size 10 or small in clothing,' she said.</p>

<p>Renee said she now enjoys six meals a day without restricting herself.</p>

<p>'I have become more informed about the decisions I am making in regards to food and eating, resulting in me being able to make better food decisions that are align with my goals without restricting myself,' she said. </p>

<p>'I still eat pizza, pasta, rice, chocolate, ice cream and takeaway, regularly going out for social events which I love because what's life if you can't eat the things you love with the people you love. I am currently on 1,900 calories per day.'</p>

<p>She said she no longer feels 'guilty' when she treats herself to her favourite foods.</p>

<p>'Honestly, I don't have guilty pleasure foods anymore as I eat dessert every night and still have pasta, rice, burgers and pizza so I never really feel like I'm missing out or indulge in a guilty pleasure food as I eat it every day,' she said.</p>

<p>'In saying that, I still love going out and getting some dumplings with my boyfriend, going to local cafes with my friends and indulging in that juicy Zinger burger.'</p>

<p>It took her over a year to shed 35 kilos altogether - and lose a total of 81.9 cm all over her body </p>

<p>Since her weight loss, Renee said she feels happier about herself more than ever</p>

<p>Her exercises included F45 which involves a mix of cardio and weight training between three to six days a week and walking at least 10,000 steps a day.</p>

<p>Since her weight loss, Renee - who documents her astonishing weight loss journey on Instagram - said she feels happier about herself more than ever. </p>

<p>'I have never loved the body I am blessed with more than I do right now, I feel so confident and full of appreciation for what I have accomplished,' she said.</p>

<p>'I frequently look back at progress photos and cry, not because I am sad but because I just get an overwhelming sense of pride and happiness. </p>

<p>'I genuinely get shocked sometimes and have a habit of occasionally buying clothes that are too big for me or are the wrong size simply because I still get shocked that I am able to buy a small or a size 10. </p>
