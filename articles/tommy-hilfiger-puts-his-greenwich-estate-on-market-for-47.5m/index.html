        <p>Designer Tommy Hilfiger is selling his Greenwich estate for $47.5million just weeks after he listed his mansion in Miami for $24.5million. </p>

<p>The sprawling French Normandy-style estate was purchased by Hilfiger and his wife, 53-year-old former model Dee Ocleppo, bought the nearly 22-acre property in 2010 for $31.3million, according to the Wall Street Journal. </p>

<p>Hilfiger, who has fixed up and sold seven homes in the affluent town over the last 35 years.</p>

<p>The home is being sold at a time when New Yorkers fleeing the COVID-19 pandemic are driving up Greenwich property values.</p>

<p>Hilfiger told the Journal: 'I hear from my friends in real estate that the market is very strong, and it hasn’t been this strong in years.' </p>

<p>While he's waiting for a buyer, he and his wife are looking for a new home in Palm Beach, Florida. Hilfiger said the he and his wife have been considering the move for long time, but COVID-19 accelerated their time line. </p>

<p>Designer Tommy Hilfiger is selling his Greenwich estate (pictured) for $47.5million just weeks after he listed his mansion in Miami for $24.5million</p>

<p>The sprawling French Normandy-style estate (kitchen pictured) was purchased by Hilfiger and his wife, 53-year-old former model Dee Ocleppo, bought the nearly 22-acre property in 2010 for $31.3million</p>

<p>The home is being sold at a time when New Yorkers fleeing the COVID-19 pandemic are driving up Greenwich property values</p>

<p>Hilfiger said: 'I hear from my friends in real estate that the market is very strong, and it hasn’t been this strong in years'</p>

<p>While he's waiting for a buyer, he and his wife are looking for a new home in Palm Beach, Florida</p>

<p>Hilfiger said the he and his wife have been considering the move for long time, but COVID-19 accelerated their time line</p>

<p>The home features a screening room that was inspired by Hilfiger’s Turkish heritage </p>

<p>And while the pandemic is partly to blame for the couple's move, Hilfiger said it isn't the only reason. </p>

<p>'As creative people, we’re always looking for that next project,' he told the Journal.  </p>

<p>The home, which was built in 1939 for real estate investor Charles Vincent Paterno, sits at the top of Round Hill Road.</p>

<p>According to the Journal, the residence was also owned by financier and prolific art collector Joseph Hirshhorn. </p>

<p>Hilfiger said that he and his wife spent three years working on the home after it fell into disrepair.   </p>

<p>He told the newspaper that they redid the home's mechanicals and rewiring. They also added new plumbing and ventilation. </p>

<p>Hilfiger said they even contracted a company in Turkey to fabricate the terra-cotta tiles to match the originals and hired landscape architect Miranda Brooks to design the gardens, hedges and fountains.</p>

<p>The couple spent millions on the project, which Hilfiger said 'took a lot of patience'. </p>

<p>Hilfiger said that he and his wife spent three years working on the home after it fell into disrepair</p>

<p>The residence features a beautifully designed tennis court that was part of the repairs Hilfiger had to do on the home  </p>

<p>The swimming pool is one of the home's outdoor features. Others include a fountained rose garden, a koi pond, and a lawn that looks out to the Long Island Sound</p>

<p>Hilfiger said he and his wife made sure that the mechanicals and rewiring on the home were redone. The entrance of the home is seen </p>

<p>In the family room, an 18th-century French fireplace was installed and there's also a wine cellar and tasting room. </p>

<p>The residence also comes with a guest house that is equipped with a kitchen, two bedrooms and a separate garage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the outdoor features are nothing shy of breathtaking.  </p>

<p>The home has a pool and renovated tennis court as well as a rose garden, a koi pond, and a lawn that looks out to the Long Island Sound. </p>

<p>The home is listed by real estate agent Janet Milligan of Sotheby’s. </p>

<p>The home is equipped with a lower-level wine cellar (pictured) and tasting room</p>

<p>The home has plenty of space to meet the next buyer's needs, including this closet area </p>

<p>The ceilings down to the floors complement one another as do the furnishings in each room </p>

<p>This kitchen fit for any chef is decorated with antler chandeliers (top center) </p>

<p>The home features three spacious powder rooms, including this one, which was used by Hilfiger's wife</p>

<p>A staircase in the home is accented by floral vases with flowers </p>

<p>In the family room, an 18th-century French fireplace was installed </p>

<p>The home (dining area pictured) is listed by real estate agent Janet Milligan of Sotheby’s</p>

<p>This sparkling bathroom is one of seven full bathrooms in Hilfiger's residence </p>

<p>In several rooms of the home, antlers are seen hanging along with animal statues with antlers </p>

<p>The new listing comes just two weeks after Hilfiger put his flamboyant mansion in Miami on the market for $24.5 million,</p>

<p>According to Variety, Hilfiger and his wife purchased the Florida property back in 2013 for $17.25million and have been trying to sell it on and off since early 2017. </p>

<p>The beachfront estate, that comprises a main residence plus two guest apartments, spans approximately 15,000 square feet and boasts a total of seven bedrooms and 10 bathrooms. </p>

<p>Variety describes the mansion as 'equal parts blue-chip pop-art gallery and chic family home.'</p>

<p>Its audacious interiors were designed, the outlet says, as a fitting space in which the German designer could house his art collection that includes pieces by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. </p>
