    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>When my first marriage ended, my two boys were four and 18 months old and the challenges felt huge. Suddenly, I had to sell a house, rent a new one and work out how to cope financially on my own.</p>

<p>At first, I struggled — I remember phoning the solicitor and crying down the line because I couldn't get the word 'divorce' out. I didn't eat properly for months.</p>

<p>But I was still a mum, so I couldn't totally sink. I had to take Tom to the park and get him ready to start primary school. I had to change Jonny's nappy and make sure they were both happy, well-fed and loved. And I had to find time for me, too.</p>

<p>That was when I decided I needed a plan of action, a way to organise my life that would stop me feeling permanently frazzled and help me fulfil my ambitions. Today, I call it The Organised Time Technique (TOTT).</p>

<p>For women who feel their time is overstretched Gemma Bray provides five easy 'time bootcamp' steps to follow (stock)</p>

<p>Some of you will already know me from my first book, The Organised Mum Method, which I devised to help me manage the housework. That built me an online following of more than 200,000 on Instagram and social media.</p>

<p>But TOTT is bigger. It's a master plan, a way of keeping the whole show on the road for all women, not just mothers.</p>

<p>Today, I am happily remarried, a mum to three boys — Ben arrived five years ago — and a stepmum, too. And TOTT is how I manage all the calls on my time while keeping enough of it aside for me. My time plan is an antidote to the craziness of modern women's lives.</p>

<p>Ignore the 'time cuckoos' that try to steal your new nest-eggs of time. They will see you doing nice things and try to use up your time to lighten their own load.</p>

<p>For example, your other half spots you reading and, because you're 'not doing anything', asks you to help with the washing up (even though you cooked dinner). 'Oh, come on,' they say. 'It'll only take ten minutes.' But they are not entitled to your time!</p>

<p>Ditch the guilt. When you start to add in chunks of relaxation time it may feel, at first, as if you are rebelling. One reason for this is that you're planning your levelthree time on a regular basis now, not just once in a blue moon.</p>

<p>But all you're doing is breaking the habit of self-neglect. </p>

<p>Just do it. It may well be that your five spare units a day don't come in a neatly packaged single chunk of time — but all those bits and pieces add up. </p>

<p>Spend 30 minutes a day doing marketing calls for your new business, or de-cluttering the garage, or learning the guitar — and by Christmas you'll have put in 45 hours, enough to really get to grips with something new.</p>

<p>Too many of us, in thrall to the never-ending to-do list, feel ground down by responsibilities — taking care of our family, running a household, succeeding in our career — all of which is made harder by the pandemic. What we need is a framework for life that takes the stress out of all that plate-spinning.</p>

<p>TOTT will give you the tools and the headspace you need.</p>

<p>After you have followed my 'time bootcamp', you will always know where you are supposed to be, what you are supposed to be doing and when.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you will carve out time to start fulfilling those dreams you put on hold when adult life got in the way.</p>

<p>So let's get to it! Simply follow this step-by-step guide...</p>

<ol>
<li>TIME BOOT CAMP</li>
</ol>

<p>Over the next week, I want you to write down everything you spend your time on.</p>

<p>That means how much sleep you're getting, how long it takes you to shower, to get to the office, to take the kids to after-school club, to do the laundry, right down to how long you spend scrolling on your phone.</p>

<p>Be honest and accurate. And track your emotions, as well — this will be crucial information later on. If you feel stressed because you're late for work or didn't have time to cook dinner from scratch, note it down.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>THE CULL</li>
</ol>

<p>In this step, I want you to start thinking of your day, not in terms of minutes and hours but as a series of half-hour units — so 48 units in each day.</p>

<p>Now take a good look at your boot camp notes and, next to each entry, write down the number of units it takes.</p>

<p>So, sleeping might be 15 units, looking at social media two units, and so on. By creating a clear list, you can start to cull or change anything that looks wasteful.</p>

<p>Gemma tells women struggling for time to 'be ruthless' and put themselves first over 'unit-sapping' tasks</p>

<p>Say you spent two units going to the shops every day after work. By doing a weekly online shop instead, you're saving 14 units a week or 728 units a year, which is an annual time saving of 364 hours. Fifteen days a year wasted on 'popping to the shop'!</p>

<ol>
<li>At the end of the day you climb into bed feeling:</li>
</ol>

<p>A. A failure for not getting through your to-do list.</p>

<p>B. Optimistic — tomorrow will be a better day, thanks to the detailed plans you've made.</p>

<p>C. Puzzled. You have no idea where the day went.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>You're asked to help with the parent–teacher association (PTA) at your teenager's school. Do you:</li>
</ol>

<p>A. Say yes and offer to chair it. You'll make the time.</p>

<p>B. Say yes and start to plan an amazing Christmas Fair, with rides as well as a celebrity Santa.</p>

<p>C. Panic! You're never quite sure what's happening in your own house, let alone school.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>WHEN it comes to work, you live for:</li>
</ol>

<p>A. A promotion. They must notice the hours you put in.</p>

<p>B. Strategy meetings. You love a coloured mind map.</p>

<p>C. Lunchtime, as you never have time for breakfast.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>You love a weekend lie-in. How often do you get one?</li>
</ol>

<p>A. Never. You're up at dawn to make pancakes and smoothies for the children.</p>

<p>B. Rarely, but it would be nice.</p>

<p>C. Regularly — and, ahem, quite often during the week, too.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>You've made time for a weekend lunch with friends. Do you spend the morning:</li>
</ol>

<p>A. Doing housework, rushing to the shops for your self-isolating neighbour and checking your work emails.</p>

<p>B. Planning a new outfit but, at the last minute, slinging on your old tea dress anyway.</p>

<p>C. Failing to get the children off to football training. Again.</p>

<p>6You've decided you need to go on a diet. Do you:</p>

<p>A. Vow to cook low-fat vegan meals from scratch for all the family, even if it takes hours.</p>

<p>B. Browse through hundreds of online diets, eating crisps.</p>

<p>C. Realise at 9pm you're out of veg so order a Deliveroo.</p>

<p>Mostly As: You're an Overachiever.</p>

<p>You are competitive and would hate anyone to think you were lazy. You find it impossible to say no and pride yourself on being busy, yet find yourself overwhelmed at times. Be careful as you are at risk of burnout.</p>

<p>You need to slow down and value your health as highly as you value what other people think of you. Make time for lie-ins, baths and book-reading.</p>

<p>Mostly Bs : You're a Dreamer.</p>

<p>You love to plan but rarely have time to actually do the things you've planned.</p>

<p>You're fond of stationery and bullet journals, but never keep a new diary up for more than a fortnight. You love strategy meetings at work but rarely get down to the details. Take TOTT step-by-step. To achieve the things you dream of, keep your focus.</p>

<p>Mostly Cs: You're a Spendthrift.</p>

<p>You tend to leave everything to the last minute, have little patience and find it hard to concentrate. You're never sure where the kids' clean school shirts are.</p>

<p>Taking control of your time will revolutionise your life and that of others around you. It's so much easier than you think.</p>

<p>For each unit-sapping task, ask yourself the question: What would happen if I didn't do it?</p>

<p>If you didn't visit your elderly mother twice a week (six units), for example, she would feel lonely. However, if you didn't volunteer at a charity shop on a Tuesday afternoon (three units), you would cause a minor inconvenience until they found someone else. Cull the latter, not the former.</p>

<p>Be ruthless!</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>CHORE DUMP</li>
</ol>

<p>On the social media channels I run, on the subjects of household management and cleaning, 98 per cent of my followers are female. I wish there were more men.</p>

<p>Why do women carry so much of the weight? No wonder resentment starts to creep in and affect other areas of the relationship.</p>

<p>Big hint: the average woman finds it hard to get into the sexy vibe when she has spent all evening tidying up and he is sitting on the sofa.</p>

<p>This is where the boot camp comes in handy — and even handier if he does the same exercise, as the evidence of what you both do around the house will be there in black and white.</p>

<p>When you talk to him about how your time is disappearing into housework and his isn't, it will take away the 'I think' and 'I feel' part of the conversation. The facts will be there.</p>

<p>Or, if you're really feeling underappreciated, you could do what one of my followers did and stick a Post-it note on every item relating to a household job you do in a day. 'At the end of the day the house was full of Post-its!' she told me. 'There was one stuck on the TV saying, 'I dusted this'. There was one next to the slow cooker, which had dinner in it, saying, 'I cooked this'. There was one on the fridge saying, 'I filled this with food'. And so on ...'</p>

<p>Once you have the evidence, have the conversation and ask him to step up.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>LEVEL UP</li>
</ol>

<p>At last! This is where you start to find that precious me-time.</p>

<p>Take all the jobs you've identified in your notes and divide them into three levels.</p>

<p>Level-one jobs you need to do every day to keep yourself and your dependents healthy — bathing, eating, cooking for children, caring for an elderly relative, sleeping.</p>

<p>Level-two jobs are important but can wait if need be — doing your tax return, cleaning the house, doing laundry, going to work (because if you take a sick day, the world won't stop).</p>

<p>And level-three jobs (cue chorus of angels) are those activities you want to do but never quite manage to fit in — having a long bath, taking up a hobby, reading a book, setting up a side-business, getting to Pilates, going to the spa.</p>

<p>Think of your level-one and level-two jobs as the legs of the swan working hard under the surface, while the level threes will make it appear that you are gliding effortlessly to hot yoga sessions three times a week.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>BUILD YOUR DAY</li>
</ol>

<p>Put in your level-one jobs first. They are the scaffolding that will hold up the rest of your TOTT plan and your life.</p>

<p>Don't be shocked at how much time they take up, just move on to adding in your level twos. When that is done, we can work out how much time you have left for the longed-for level-three treats.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<p>This leaves you with 4.5 units for your level-three 'me time'. That's two hours 15 minutes — which is a fair bit, don't you think?</p>
