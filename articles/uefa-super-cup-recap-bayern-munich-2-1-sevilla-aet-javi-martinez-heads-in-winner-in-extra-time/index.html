<p>PETE JENSON: Bayern Munich finally crushed the spirit of Sevilla to win the UEFA Super Cup final 2-1.</p>

<p>But as the relentless red machine added another trophy to the Champions League it won last month and extended its run of straight wins to 23 games, it was tested to the limit by the Europe League holders</p>

<p>Spanish substitute Javi Martinez got the winner for Bayern, heading past Bono after the Sevilla keeper had parried a David Alaba shot straight to him. There were 104 draining minutes on the clock when Bayern finally got themselves in front.</p>

<p>CLICK BELOW TO READ THE FULL MATCH REPORT</p>

<p>There goes the full-whistle and treble-winners Bayern Munich will lift yet another trophy in the Super Cup.</p>

<p>Sevilla will feel like they should've won it in normal time but it's the German champions to win this campaign's first piece of European silverware.</p>

<p>118min: With just a couple minutes left on the clock, Bayern are just playing keep-ball to see out the game. But Sevilla now have a rare bit of possession and are looking to lump the ball forward. Bayern deal with it well though.</p>

<p>114min: He's still looking for that goal but it doesn't look like he's going to it, Lewandowski. He breaks through but still has a man to beat so he smacks it towards Sevilla's net but it goes over and wide.</p>

<p>112min: A blue-haired Jerome Boateng comes on for David Alaba, who has had a strong game but was the man to give away the penalty early on in the encounter.</p>

<p>110min: Bayern aren't resting on their laurels. They're continuing to press forward and Alphonso Davies is proving to be quite the problem for those tired Sevilla legs on the left. Bayern have a corner.</p>

<p>Can Bayern hold on, or even extend their lead to become the new Super Cup champions? We have 15 more minutes of action here, so let's find out.</p>

<p>Bayern have got themselves in front and nearly scored another just before the whistle but Diego Carlos superbly blocked on the line before the whistle.</p>

<p>Martinez was on the pitch for just five minutes before making what could be the crucial difference for the German champions.</p>

<p>104min: It's the substitute Javi Martinez that gives Bayern the lead with a brilliant header after some lapse goalkeeping from Bono. Just before conceding the corner that led to the goal, Bono was frustrated with Diego Carlos following a breakdown in communication. Sloppy all round from the Spanish side.</p>

<p>102min: Tolisso manages to catch the Sevilla defence napping as he makes his way into the opposition area before firing a shot at Bono's near post. The Sevilla goalkeeper is equal to it but it's the first time Sevilla have switched off in a long while.</p>

<p>98min: Goalscorer Goretzka makes way for Alphonso Davies while it's a like-for-like swap as Lucas Hernandez makes way for Javi Martinez.</p>

<p>It's going to be a late night in Budapest as these two sides will have to slog it out for another half an hour, not that we're complaining.</p>

<p>Alaba gets an free-kick early on in the first half of extra time but can't direct it on goal. Just before that, Youssef En Nesyri's snap shot at goal is save by Neuer and tipped onto the post in an electric start to the return of action.</p>

<p>Bayern had a couple of goals ruled out but Sevilla should've won it late on through Youssef En Nesyri.</p>

<p>We'll have a short break before another 30 minutes of football.</p>

<p>90+2min: There's just no breaking down this Sevilla side and Diego Carlos. They've been brilliant this second half and have defended everything thrown at them. We look to be heading for extra time.</p>

<p>87min: Sevilla should be 2-1 up but are denied by UEFA Mens Player of the Year nominee Manuel Neuer. With a quick counter-attack, Youssef En Nesyri is through one-on-one and all the space in the world to score. But the substitute gave away where he was going to put the ball, allowing Neuer to read the situation and make a brilliant save to deny Sevilla a winning goal.</p>

<p>84min: Sevilla have a low block in place to deal with any Bayern threat as two rows of five sit just above their own box while the Germans work the ball round, looking for an opening. </p>

<p>80min: The Spanish side haven't had many chances at goal but when they've gone forward, they've looked threatening. A cross is whipped into the back post where Ocampos hangs in the air for what seems an eternity but fouls his man in the process.</p>

<p>76min: It's another chance for Bayern as Serge Gnabry squares the ball back across the face of goal to an on-rushing Lewandowski but his shot in front of goal is blocked and it's out for a corner, which comes to nothing. Bayern continue to knock at the door.</p>

<p>72min: Julen Lopetegui makes another change as he sends on Nemanja Gudelj for Suso.</p>

<p>70min: Leroy Sane makes way for Corentin Tolisso and gets a pat on the back for a good shift in Budapest.</p>

<p>66min: Bayern win a dangerous free-kick after a foul on Thomas Muller which David Alaba steps up to take. However, there's too much on it and it fails to come back down in time after going over the wall.</p>

<p>63min: Leroy Sane has the ball in the back of the net but Anthony Taylor blew his whistle in the build up for a foul from Lewandowski. The Polish striker headed the ball back for Leon Goretzka to fire at goal but was adjudged to have fouled his man. Goretzka's shot was saved by Bono before Sane smashed the ball home.</p>

<p>58min: Bayern have been denied twice by a wonderful save and block, after Serge Gnabry's initial shot was palmed away by Bono for Sane's follow-up effort to be blocked by Diego Carlos.</p>

<p>56min: Ivan Rakitic's second debut comes to an end after he is subbed off for Oliver Torres. He made the desired impact for Sevilla having won the penalty for Ocampos to score.</p>

<p>52min: We're back to 1-1 after a quick VAR review reveals that Lewandowski was offside in the build-up but only marginally. </p>

<p>It was a fantastic goal but the replays confirm the infringement.</p>

<p>51min: Bayern finally get their go-ahead goal as Robert Lewandowski puts into the back of the net after toying with the Sevilla defence.</p>

<p>46min: What a quick start from Sevilla! They've gone straight up Bayern's end and nearly regained the lead. Luuk de Jong is the man to force Neuer into a smart save and it's the Spanish team that are piling on the early pressure.</p>

<p>Sevilla have shown how tactically astute they are with how they've set up against the in-form Bayern but the German champions have been wasteful in front of goal up until Goretzka's equaliser.</p>

<p>Who's going to come out on top in this one?</p>

<p>Celtic and Tottenham have made it into the final round of qualifying but Motherwell's short European campaign comes to an end after they were comfortably beaten 3-0 by Beer Sheva.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Rangers, AC Milan and Wolfsburg are all leading while Aberdeen trail to Sporting.</p>

<p>And there goes the final whistle in Macedonia. It's job done for Jose Mourinho's men but there was a moment where it looked like an upset could be on the cards.</p>

<p>However, when you have the likes of Harry Kane and Lucas Moura coming off the bench, there was no doubt in the result. They march on to the play-off rounds where they will face Rostov or Maccabi Haifa for a place in the group stage of the Europa League.</p>

<p>And it's all level at the break in what has been an entertaining first half in Hungary. Bayern have had a wealth of chances – one of which has been dispatched – but they should probably have more.</p>

<p>Sevilla have matched them but have defended more than what they have attacked, which is to be expected.</p>

<p>Play to resume in the 15 minutes or so.</p>

<p>43min: Sevilla are finding a lot more space in between the German backline but Bayern are doing well to defend any attacks thrown at them following Ocampos' opener. You'll feel they'll be disappointed that they don't have the lead going into half-time.</p>

<p>80min: And that's job done for Tottenham as Harry Kane heads in a third goal with 10 minutes of play left. The Spurs talisman managed to get on to the end of a beautifully whipped in cross from Son, leaving the Shkendija backline rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>34min: Normal service has been resumed as Bayern finally get their goal through Leon Goretzka. The midfielder arrives late into the box as he thumps home from the penalty spot after a beautifully cushioned lay off from Lewandowski.</p>

<p>30min: Yes you read that right. The prolific striker has failed to beat Sevilla's Bono one-on-one after attempting to chip the goalkeeper, who stood tall. That's two big opportunities gone begging.</p>

<p>26min: It was a brilliant chance to equalise for the German outfit but Benjamin Pavard's effort sails just wide of the Sevilla goal. The Frenchman did ever so well to lose his marker inside the box to get a shot off.</p>

<p>70min: Tottenham have regained the lead and it's through Son Heung-min who manages to smash his shot into the roof of the goal, past the men who were stood on the Shkendija line. It's a sigh of relief for Jose who will now want his men to push on and maintain this lead.</p>

<p>23min: Bayern have responded well to going a goal down and should've equalised through Thomas Muller but the German couldn't direct his effort on target in what would've been a certain goal.</p>

<p>13min: And it's first blood to Sevilla from the penalty spot as Lucas Ocampos scored a no-look spot-kick past the helpless Manuel Neuer! What nerve to try that in the Super Cup final. Great start to the final.</p>

<p>It's all happening at once! But just as I say Sevilla haven't threatened, Ivan Rakitic has won a penalty after he is bundled over in the box by Alaba.</p>

<p>55min: What an equaliser from the Macedonian outfit! Valmir Nafiu picks up the ball outside the Tottenham area after some sustained pressure and absolutely thumps one in the top right hand corner to make it 1-1. Harry Kane has been brought on for the visitors in response.</p>

<p>9min: There were a few worrying signs that Bayern would dominate from the get go with their high press but Sevilla are enjoying a lot more possession and have had a few chances at goal - but nothing threatening.</p>

<p>2min: Only a couple of minutes have gone but Bayern are already pressing high and winning the ball in advanced areas. Can Sevilla manage what PSG couldn't and exploit the German's high-line?</p>

<p>Screams of 'come on!' come from the Bayern contingent as the national athemn finishes. There's no artificial noises for this one and it's wonderful to hear.</p>

<p>But who will displace Liverpool as the new Super Cup champions? Let's find out.</p>

<p>A third of the Puskas Arena is filled with socially-distanced fans but the stage is set.</p>

<p>Will Bayern continue their dominance or can Sevilla show why they're specialists in European competitions?</p>

<p>Tottenham go into the break 1-0 up thanks to Erik Lamela's early goal but it should have been more, given how much Spurs have dominated.</p>

<p>Elsewhere across Europe, Celtic have netted a stoppage-time winner against Riga to put them through to the final qualifying round while Motherwell trail by one goal in their tie with Beer Sheva.</p>

<p>40min: Were just five minutes until the half-time interval and Spurs have predictably been on top. Mourinho's men should've been 2-0 up but Dele Alli saw his effort cleared off the line in what would have been a good way to respond to his critics amid talk he could move away from the club.</p>

<p>The mayor of Budapest Gergely Karácsony has warned against UEFA's decision to allow fans into the stadium for the Super Cup final between Bayern Munich and Sevilla.</p>

<p>The final, played between the winner of last season's Champions League and Europa League, is to be held at the Puskas Arena in Hungary's capital. </p>

<p>Whilst UEFA hoped that the ceremonious final would open the gateway for the return of fans for the upcoming season, their plan is now under threat with the rising cases of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Every player and member of staff has their temperature checked on arrival while facemasks are worn to adhere to Covid safety measures.</p>

<p>Not sure about the social distancing that's going on but it feels like a cup final of yesteryear.</p>

<p>Let's hope everyone stays safe, adheres to the social distancing rules and enjoys the game.</p>

<p>Six trophies in fifteen years has proven Sevilla are well worthy of their 'Europa League specialists' label, but such dominance has failed to translate in the UEFA Super Cup final. </p>

<p>The Spanish club have been victorious in just one of their previous five appearances in the showpiece event, and will have their work cut out against Bayern Munich, winners of Europe's premier competition after their 1-0 triumph over PSG. </p>

<p>Hansi Flick's relentless side currently boast a 31-match unbeaten run, yet Sevilla are known to thrive in their role as underdogs, conceding an early penalty in each of their last three matches of last season's Europa League competition and ultimately culminating in a 3-2 final victory over Inter Milan in Cologne.</p>

<p>4min: Well, that's exactly the start Tottenham wanted, wasn't it? Son Heung-min picks up the ball outside a crowded box but manages to slip through Erik Lamela who calmly finishes to make it 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's men. That will settle any nerves for the Premier League side.</p>

<p>Tottenham are wearing their bright yellow strips for the encounter while the hosts are wearing their red and blue strip.</p>

<p>Can Spurs avoid another banana skin against a team that's never made the group stages? Let's find out...</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for Sevilla, Europa League finalist hero Luuk De Jong will lead the line for the Spanish side tonight while Ivan Rakitic is handed his second debut for the club.</p>

<p>Now onto Super Cup team news: Hansi Flick has named a strong starting lineup to face Sevilla, which sees Bayern's two UEFA Men's Player of the Year nominees in Robert Lewandowski and Manuel Neuer start in Budapest.</p>

<p>It comes just a week after Premier Sports were forced to apologise to viewers for their coverage out in Bulgaria, where fans missed red cards and plenty of goals in Spurs' win over Lokomotiv Plovdiv.</p>

<p>Tonight's game can be watched on Premier Sports 1...</p>

<p>It is currently 0-0 at half-time in Celtic's clash with Riga in their qualifying game, while there have also been no goals in Motherwell's encounter with Beer Sheva.</p>

<p>That game is only 20 minutes in so there's still plenty of time for Steve Robinson's team to get a goal out in Israel.</p>

<p>Rangers and Aberdeen are due to kick off at 8pm BST.</p>

<p>I'm not going to lie, I'm not too familiar with many of the names in their starting XI, but Spurs fans will be hoping Jose has done his homework for tonight's clash.</p>
