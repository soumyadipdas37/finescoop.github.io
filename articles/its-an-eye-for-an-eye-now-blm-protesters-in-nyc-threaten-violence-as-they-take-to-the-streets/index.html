<p>'All of this anger, and they still have billions of our dollars,' another speaker told the crowd at Barclays, referring to the police.</p>

<p>'They're using our money, taxpayer money, to brutalize us. To murder us!' </p>

<p>Another speaker asked demonstrators to lie down on the pavement in front of the arena for 8 minutes and 46 seconds - the amount of time that Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, pressed his knee against the neck of George Floyd on May 25. Floyd died in police custody. </p>

<p>'Today, you're Eric Garner,' the speaker said. </p>

<p>Another speaker said: 'You ain't feel this f****** s***, you ain't f****** human.'</p>

<p>'That's real talk.' </p>

<p>Video images from social media showed the peaceful crowd listening to speakers in what was a subdued atmosphere.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, the large crowd began marching toward Manhattan Bridge. An estimated 2,000 people made their way north on Flatbush Avenue.</p>

<p>The protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter' and were encouraged by motorists honking their horns. They occupied all inbound and outbound lanes of the Manhattan Bridge while walking across both the upper and lower roadways into Manhattan.</p>

<p>Holding signs, thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Chinatown. Many of them chanted 'No justice, no peace.'</p>

<p>Massive marches were also seen in the East Village and SoHo.</p>

<p>In Buffalo, New York, a protester was injured after being struck by a pickup truck at a protest in Niagara Square. Police say the victim's injuries were not considered life threatening.</p>

<p>All indications as of late Wednesday evening are that the New York Police Department has taken a hands-off approach and allowed the protesters to march unimpeded in what have so far been peaceful demonstrations. </p>

<p>In Louisville, authorities said two officers were shot and wounded Wednesday night during the demonstrations expressing anger over the killings of black people at the hands of police.</p>

<p>Interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said a suspect was in custody but did not offer details about whether that person was participating in the demonstrations. He says both officers are expected to recover, and one is undergoing surgery.</p>

<p>He says the officers were shot after investigating reports of gunfire at an intersection where there was a large crowd.</p>

<p>Several shots rang out as protesters in downtown Louisville tried to avoid police blockades, moving down an alleyway as officers lobbed pepper balls, according to an Associated Press journalist. </p>

<p>People covered their ears, ran away and frantically looked for places to hide. Police with long guns swarmed the area, then officers in riot gear and military-style vehicles blocked off roadways.</p>

<p>The violence comes after prosecutors said two officers who fired their weapons at Taylor, a black woman, were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend. </p>

<p>The only charges were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into a home next to Taylor's with people inside.</p>

<p>The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in connection with the raid at Taylor's home on March 13. </p>

<p>Scuffles broke out between police and protesters, and some were arrested. </p>

<p>Officers fired flash bangs and a few small fires burned in a square that's been at the center of protests, but it had largely cleared out ahead of a nighttime curfew as demonstrators marched through other parts of downtown Louisville. </p>

<p>Dozens of patrol cars blocked the city´s major thoroughfare and more police arrived after the officer was shot.</p>

<p>Demonstrators also marched in cities like Chicago, Washington, DC, Atlanta and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Police say they have deployed chemical agents on Atlanta protesters demonstrating against the grand jury's decision not to indict officers for the fatal shooting of Taylor.</p>

<p>Georgia State Patrol Spokesperson Franka Young has told The Associated Press the chemical agents were fired after 'some unruly protesters' attempted to climb on top of a SWAT vehicle that was stationed in the city.</p>

<p>'They were given orders to get off of the vehicle and when they ignored the orders, the SWAT team was forced to utilize less lethal gas to deter them,' Young said. </p>

<p>Some protesters were also arrested after refusing orders to disperse from roads and to walk on sidewalks, Young said. </p>

<p>It is not clear how many people were arrested. Young said many protesters had followed police orders. </p>

<p>Hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Chicago and various neighborhoods around the city to protest the lack of charges directly connected to Taylor's shooting death.</p>

<p>Other demonstrators gathered in downtown's Millennium Park chanting demands for justice as passing motorists on Michigan Avenue honked their horns.</p>

<p>Activist priest the Reverend Michael Pfleger told protesters gathered in the middle of an intersection that they should peacefully let those who represent the status quo know of their unhappiness with the Taylor decision.</p>

<p>'We're here tonight because we do care,' Pfleger said. </p>

<p>'And we're here because we want to say, 'We object and we don't accept it. Somebody has to be held accountable'.'</p>

<p>Protesters also gathered outside the Chicago Police Department headquarters. </p>

<p>In Seattle, several arrests were made after protesters threw fireworks at the East Precinct on Capitol Hill, 'nearly striking officers in the process,' according to police. </p>

<p>The SPD also said protesters had been throwing glass bottles at officers. The protesters were charged with obstruction, assaulting an officer, and property damage.</p>

<p>Two separate protests were held in the city, one at Westlake Center where a candlelight vigil was held at 7pm, and the other at Cal Anderson Park. </p>

<p>State Attorney General Daniel Cameron, however, said the investigation showed the officers announced themselves before entering. </p>

<p>The warrant used to search her home was connected to a suspect who did not live there, and no drugs were found inside.</p>

<p>Along with the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, Taylor's case became a major touchstone for nationwide protests that have drawn attention to entrenched racism and demanded police reform. </p>

<p>Taylor's image has been painted on streets, emblazoned on protest signs and silk-screened on T-shirts worn by celebrities. </p>

<p>Several prominent African American celebrities joined those urging that the officers be charged.</p>

<p>The announcement drew sadness, frustration and anger that the grand jury did not go further. </p>

<p>The wanton endangerment charges each carry a sentence of up to five years.</p>

<p>Morgan Julianna Lee, a high school student in Charlotte, North Carolina, watched the announcement at home.</p>

<p>'It's almost like a slap in the face,' the 15-year-old said by phone. 'If I, as a black woman, ever need justice, I will never get it.'</p>

<p>Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said he authorized a limited deployment of the National Guard. </p>

<p>Police and protesters are facing off in Louisville after a Kentucky grand jury cleared three officers of charges for the shooting death of Breonna Taylor (pictured) </p>

<p>Beshear also urged Cameron, the state attorney general, to post online all the evidence that could be released without affecting the charges filed.</p>

<p>'Those that are currently feeling frustration, feeling hurt, they deserve to know more,' he said.</p>

<p>The case exposed the wide gulf between public opinion on justice for those who kill black Americans and the laws under which those officers are charged, which regularly favor police and do not often result in steep criminal accusations.</p>

<p>At a news conference, Cameron spoke to that disconnect: 'Criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief.'</p>

<p>'But my heart breaks for the loss of Miss Taylor. ... My mother, if something was to happen to me, would find it very hard,' he added, choking up.</p>

<p>But Cameron, who is the state's first black attorney general, said the officers acted in self-defense after Taylor's boyfriend fired at them. </p>

<p>He added that Hankison and the two other officers who entered Taylor's apartment announced themselves before entering - and so did not execute the warrant as 'no knock,' according to the investigation. </p>

<p>The city has since banned such warrants.</p>

<p>'According to Kentucky law, the use of force by (Officers Jonathan) Mattingly and (Myles) Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves,' he said. </p>

<p>'This justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylor's death.'</p>

<p>Cameron said an FBI crime lab determined that Cosgrove fired the bullet that killed Taylor.</p>

<p>Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, opened fire when police burst in, hitting Mattingly. </p>

<p>Walker told police he heard knocking but didn't know who was coming in and fired in self-defense.</p>

<p>Cameron, who is a Republican, is a protégé of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and has been tagged by some as his heir apparent. </p>

<p>His was also one of 20 names on President Donald Trump's list to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy.</p>

<p>At a news conference, Trump read a statement from Cameron saying 'justice is not often easy.' </p>

<p>Fired Louisville detective Brett Hankison (above in his mugshot) was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment in connection to the police raid on the night of March 13</p>

<p>He praised both Cameron's handling of the case and the governor calling up of the National Guard.</p>

<p>Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden told reporters that he didn't have enough information on the decision to comment fully but warned protesters to stay peaceful.</p>

<p>'Do not sully her memory or her mother's by engaging in any violence,' he said.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate and a former prosecutor, also told reporters she hadn't fully read the decision.</p>

<p>'But there's no question that Breonna Taylor and her family deserved justice yesterday, today and tomorrow, so I'll review it,' she said.</p>

<p>Hankison was fired on June 23. </p>

<p>A termination letter sent by interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said he had violated procedures by showing 'extreme indifference to the value of human life' when he 'wantonly and blindly' fired his weapon.</p>

<p>Mattingly, Cosgrove and the detective who sought the warrant, Joshua Jaynes, were placed administrative reassignment.</p>

<p>Last week, the city settled a lawsuit against the three officers brought by Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, agreeing to pay her $12million and enact police reforms.   </p>
