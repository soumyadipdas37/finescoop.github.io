        <p>Lisa Rinna angrily accused Denise Richards of 'gaslighting' her castmates during The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills season 10 reunion that aired Wednesday on Bravo.</p>

<p>During the first of three virtual reunion episodes, Lisa, 57, vented her fury at Denise, 49, for her repeated criticisms of the cast.</p>

<p>Above all, she couldn't let go of the fact that Denise had chastised them for discussing threesomes during a barbecue at her house, within earshot of her kids.</p>

<p>Season reunion: Lisa Rinna angrily accused Denise Richards of 'gaslighting' her castmates during The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills season 10 reunion that aired Wednesday on Bravo</p>

<p>Lisa quickly reminded Denise that she'd shared plenty of her own dirty stories on camera.</p>

<p>'You bring up your husband's penis almost every show,' she yelled, referring to a remark the actress made about her husband Aaron Phypers, 47, at that same dinner.</p>

<p>'I think she was trying to make us as a group look bad,' Erika Girardi, 49, opined, recalling the proximity of the kids' table to the adults', where sex talk was sure to be had.</p>

<p>Lisa also mentioned a tale Denise told last season about the sexual encounters she and Aaron had enjoyed with certain masseurs.</p>

<p>Under fire: During the first of three reunion episodes, Lisa, 57, vented her fury at Denise, 49, for her repeated criticisms of the cast</p>

<p>'The whole world knows about Denise's husband going and getting a happy ending from like, a 100-year old woman,' Lisa shouted.</p>

<p>Erika recalled that Denise had taken her out to coffee to talk to her about the threesome conversation, and emphasized that she'd felt singled out by Denise's anger.</p>

<p>'I took it on the chin; I apologized sincerely,' Erika said. 'Then I find out you take it to Teddi [Mellencamp-Arroyave, 39] and Sutton [Stracke]. Motherf<strong><em>er, I'm out. That's bulls</em></strong>.'</p>

<p>Look bad: 'I think she was trying to make us as a group look bad,' Erika Girardi, 49, opined of Denise, recalling the proximity of the kids' table to the adults', where sex talk was sure to be had</p>

<p>Denise denied singling out Erika or complaining about her, which made Erika apoplectic.</p>

<p>'Denise, oh my God,' she blurted. 'Am I on another f***ing planet?'</p>

<p>'No, you're just being gaslit, Erika,' Lisa cracked.</p>

<p>Another planet: 'Denise, oh my God,' Erika blurted. 'Am I on another f***ing planet?'</p>

<p>Denise told reunion host Andy Cohen, 52, that she hadn't been trying to distract viewers by suddenly getting prudish, as some had claimed.</p>

<p>Instead, she felt like her castmates were just making her a target by repeating old stories, and added, 'Agree to disagree and move on from it.'</p>

<p>'I wasn't the one who brought it up every single dinner,' Denise emphasized.</p>

<p>The host: Denise told reunion host Andy Cohen, 52, that she hadn't been trying to distract viewers by suddenly getting prudish, as some had claimed</p>

<p>'Yes, you were,' Lisa said, singing, 'Gaslighting, gaslighting, let's have some gaslighting. That's what I have to say about all this bulls***. It's all gaslighting. Good job, Denise, good job.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Lisa Rinna,' Denise said, looking horrified.</p>

<p>The former Wild Things star had been at odds with her castmates all season.</p>

<p>Original song: 'Yes, you were,' Lisa said, singing, 'Gaslighting, gaslighting, let's have some gaslighting. That's what I have to say about all this bulls***. It's all gaslighting. Good job, Denise, good job'</p>

<p>Several of them took her to task for saying she wouldn't bring her kids around them again after they discussed their sexual proclivities during the barbecue.</p>

<p>The actress rightly pointed out that Sutton and Lisa had already suggested she not bring her kids to adult parties, and noted that she didn't want the kids to see her attacked.</p>

<p>'My experience is, with the husbands around, when's the last time we've ever talked about sex with this group?' she asked, suggesting that the problem lay with her pals.</p>

<p>Sex talk: 'My experience is, with the husbands around, when's the last time we've ever talked about sex with this group?' Denise asked, suggesting that the problem lay with her gal pals</p>

<p>'We talk about sex all the time,' Lisa countered.</p>

<p>Denise promised that she hadn't kept bringing the incident up, and only spoke to Teddi and Sutton 'mom-to-mom' to discuss how awkward things could get with kids.</p>

<p>Erika and Kyle noted that when the barbecue episode aired, Denise's daughter Sami, 15, looked amused by the conversation, and they hadn't heard anything else since.</p>

<p>Together again: The cast gathered virtually for the season 10 reunion due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Erika had taken heat for saying on the show that Denise's kids probably knew about threesomes, and clarified at the reunion that she'd simply meant teens understood such things.</p>

<p>'Stop the false outrage,' she urged Denise.</p>

<p>Denise acknowledged that she had gotten upset when she heard the remark, to which Erika replied, 'Of course you did. It was convenient for you.'</p>

<p>That's convenient: Denise acknowledged that she had gotten upset when she heard Erika's remark, to which Erika replied, 'Of course you did. It was convenient for you'</p>

<p>'Have you seen how the fans have come at us because of it?' asked Lisa, referring to a tweet posted online that had suggested she be fired, and called her a racist, too.</p>

<p>Denise had liked the tweet, but told the women that she'd only read the part of it that was addressed to Erika, and didn't know those things were said.</p>

<p>'You did it in a public forum!' Lisa spat. 'You liked a tweet like that, that was so vile and nasty. You knew exactly what you were doing. Don't you f*** around and lie to me about that.'</p>

<p>Liked it: 'You did it in a public forum!' Lisa spat to Denise. 'You liked a tweet like that, that was so vile and nasty. You knew exactly what you were doing. Don't you f*** around and lie to me about that'</p>

<p>Denise reiterated that she wasn't lying, and when she said she had the post taken down, Lisa yelled, 'Because Bravo f***ing called you and said, ''Take it down''.'</p>

<p>'F***ing shut up,' Lisa told her former pal. 'Denise, you lie, lie, lie, lie.'</p>

<p>When Andy asked Denise whether she'd spoken to her kids about all the sexual stories she'd told on the show, Denise said her kids didn't watch the show, which Erika called 'bulls***.'</p>

<p>Shut it: 'F***ing shut up,' Lisa told her former pal. 'Denise, you lie, lie, lie, lie'</p>

<p>'They did hear about some things from their friends…' Denise conceded.</p>

<p>'Did they hear about the happy ending?' Erika asked. 'Or did they just hear about the bad things about us as a group?'</p>

<p>Throughout the episode, RHOBH's newest cast member, Garcelle Beauvais, 53, defended Denise, her friend of 20 years.</p>

<p>New addition: Throughout the episode, RHOBH's newest cast member, Garcelle Beauvais, 53, defended Denise, her friend of 20 years</p>

<p>As the show opened, Andy also addressed Garcelle's beef with Kyle Richards, 51.</p>

<p>Garcelle had said several times on the show that Kyle 'glazed over' what she was saying in conversations, and intimated that she was the least welcoming of the housewives.</p>

<p>She amended that during the reunion by insisting that she'd never said Kyle was horrible to her, and joking that she made the last comment after drinking and forgetting other names.</p>

<p>Ongoing beef: As the show opened, Andy also addressed Garcelle's beef with Kyle Richards, 51</p>

<p>Denise and Dorit Kemsley, 44, agreed that Kyle could sometimes make the other women feel like what they had to say was unimportant, and Kyle apologized.</p>

<p>To Garcelle, Kyle added, 'It felt like you were picking a problem with me that was disingenuous. You were never there; we had no time to bond.'</p>

<p>Pressing on, Kyle added, 'Then you came to my charity event, and raised your paddle to donate $5,000 to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and never paid.'</p>

<p>Never paid: Pressing on, Kyle added, 'Then you came to my charity event, and raised your paddle to donate $5,000 to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and never paid'</p>

<p>'What?' Garcelle yelped, leaning forward. 'That is not true. You better watch what you're saying.'</p>

<p>She stressed that something must have gone wrong, and later sent an email to her business manager to check on the payment.</p>

<p>When Kyle added that Garcelle had not been nice to her, Garcelle said, 'Stop. I've seen your tweets,' as a nasty one appeared onscreen.</p>

<p>Full stop: When Kyle added that Garcelle had not been nice to her, Garcelle said, 'Stop. I've seen your tweets,' as a nasty one appeared onscreen</p>

<p>'Garcelle snickering that my outfit is hideous while wearing stretchy purple knee high boots with a pink suit dress… that her stylist picked out for her,' Kyle had written.</p>

<p>Andy asked Garcelle how it felt being 'the first Black housewife of Beverly Hills,' and Garcelle replied, 'It's really cool. I mean, it's always great to be the first anything, right?'</p>

<p>She revealed that she had felt pressure to come in and 'just snap at everybody,' noting, 'We're labeled angry women a lot, Black women, because we are outspoken, we're strong. And sometimes I hate that word 'strong,' because it makes people negate my pain.'</p>

<p>Nothing but: Kyle in June posted that she had been nothing but nice and nothing but kind to Garcelle</p>

<p>Andy reminded Garcelle that she'd said the RHOBH cast might be afraid of 'Black social media coming for them' if they made a wrong step with her, and she stood by that, saying that because she was Black, her role in show disagreements might be seen as 'a racial thing.'</p>

<p>'I never felt like that,' Kyle said. 'If I had had an issue with you, I would have addressed it.'</p>

<p>Touching on current events, Garcelle said she'd always spoken to her 12-year-old twin boys about racial injustices and urged them to be careful and respectful with the police.</p>

<p>Racial injustice: Touching on current events, Garcelle said she'd always spoken to her 12-year-old twin boys about racial injustices and urged them to be careful and respectful with the police</p>

<p>Months before the reunion, she had been pulled over by police with her son Jax in the backseat.</p>

<p>'I was so happy that Jax actually got to see my interaction with the police,' Garcelle affirmed. 'Obviously, I was respectful, I had my hands on the wheel, ten and two; I said, ''I'm reaching for my wallet.'' And it's interesting you know because when I say this to my other friends, who happen to be white, they're like, ''Wow, would someone like you have to do that?'' And I was like, ''Absolutely, someone like me. It doesn't matter what my resumé said, or what I've done.''</p>

<p>She marveled that it had taken COVID-19 for everybody to 'be still and to watch George Floyd, and to be able to get things to finally change. And I feel hopeful, but it's still been like… It's been a long time coming.'</p>

<p>At home: Andy hosted the reunion remotely as the women talked about racial injustice</p>

<p>Kyle said she'd spoken to her daughters about what was going on, and Garcelle said she'd be happy for her friends to ask her questions so they could 'grow from it' as a group.</p>

<p>Erika, whose son is a policeman, acknowledged that Garcelle was the first person to reach out to her about him after protests started happening.</p>

<p>Andy then turned his attention to new cast member Sutton Stracke, whose penchant for couture and plain-speaking sometimes lands her in hot water.</p>

<p>First reunion: Andy then turned his attention to new cast member Sutton Stracke, whose penchant for couture and plain-speaking sometimes lands her in hot water</p>

<p>At an event hosted by Lisa Rinna's daughters during the season, Sutton thought she spotted her old makeup artist and declared she might 'freak out.'</p>

<p>Dorit had made Sutton sound threatening when retelling the story, and apologized on the reunion for mistakenly painting her as angry.</p>

<p>Lisa said she loved Sutton, though Sutton sniped that Lisa threw her 'out to the sharks' anyway.</p>

<p>Apology offered: Dorit Kemsley had made Sutton sound threatening when retelling the story, and apologized on the reunion for mistakenly painting her as angry</p>

<p>Natural look: The show opened with cast members going through a technical rehearsal at home, including Dorit who showed her natural beauty without full makeup</p>

<p>Teddi still resented Sutton for once saying her pregnancy was 'ugh.'</p>

<p>'Something I'm so grateful for and I think is such a miracle, you're kind of mocking?' Teddi asked. 'Like, eff off.'</p>

<p>'We all have insecurities, and I think mine came out at the beginning,' Sutton admitted. 'I did kind of look like an a<strong>hole. I looked like a snotty a</strong>hole. But that's not who I am.'</p>

<p>The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Reunion part two will air next week on Bravo.</p>

<p>Still resentful: Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave still resented Sutton for once saying her pregnancy was 'ugh.'</p>
