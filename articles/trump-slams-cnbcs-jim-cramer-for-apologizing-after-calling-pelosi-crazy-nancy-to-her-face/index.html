        <p>Donald Trump on Wednesday chastised CNBC host Jim Cramer for apologizing for calling Speaker Nancy Pelosi 'crazy' - a moniker the president has given her.</p>

<p>'Jim, you didn't make a mistake. It's true, and that's why you said it. No pandering!,' Trump wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>Cramer, in an interview with the speaker on his CNBC's 'Squawk On The Street' show on Tuesday morning, called Pelosi 'crazy' to her face.</p>

<p>He apologized right afterward to Pelosi, saying he was channeling the president. Additionally, he took to Twitter to apologize some more and then offered a longer apology on air later in the day as outrage against him blew up on social media. </p>

<p>Donald Trump on Wednesday chastised CNBC host Jim Cramer for apologizing for calling Speaker Nancy Pelosi 'crazy' - a moniker the president has given her</p>

<p>'I made a very stupid comment,' Cramer said. 'It was tongue-in-cheek attempt to make a point about the harsh tone of the negotiations in Washington but it fell completely flat and I apologize for that. As I said immediately after the comment I want to make it clear that I have an incredible amount of respect for both the speaker and the office she holds.'</p>

<p>Trump and Pelosi have an acrimonious relationship. He often refers to her as 'crazy' both in his tweets and at campaign rallies, a remark that gets his supporters cheering. She has called him 'morbidly obese.'</p>

<p>Their first Oval Office meeting - which took place shortly after Democrats retook control of the House in the 2018 election - resulted in the two leaders engaging in a bickering back-and-forth - all in front of the cameras. From there, things got worse. Pelosi eventually called a formal impeachment inquiry against him - Trump was acquitted by the Senate - and he refused to shake her hand at his State of the Union address while she ripped up the text of his remarks when he was done speaking. </p>

<p>Trump has never apologized for his words on the speaker, the most powerful woman in government and second in line to the presidency.</p>

<p>Cramer did so after, in an interview on Tuesday, when he was asking Pelosi about the prospects for a deal between Democrats and Republicans on a new coronavirus economic aid bill when he said to her: 'What deal can we have, Crazy Nancy?' </p>

<p>'Sorry, that was the president,' Cramer immediately said after the comment. 'I have such reverence for the office, I would never use that term.'  </p>

<p>Pelosi laughed and said, 'but you just did, but you just did,' and then called Trump the 'master of projection.' </p>

<p>CNBC's Jim Cramer (left) called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (right) 'crazy Nancy,' the nickname given to her by President Donald Trump. Cramer immediately walked back the comment  </p>

<p>Jim Cramer tried to walk back using the term 'crazy Nancy' to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's face in an interview Tuesday, saying that he found the Trump nickname 'horrifying' </p>

<p>'Let me just say this, anything the president says is a projection of his own insecurities. He calls other people crazy because he knows he is,' she said. </p>

<p>'So anytime he says something you say, 'Uh-oh, that's what he's thinking of himself,' she continued. </p>

<p>Cramer tried to walk back his comments several times throughout the 'Squawk on the Street' interview.  </p>

<p>'You know, I was being facetious when I used the term involving you,' he said. 'I respect you. Anyone who gives their life to public service and is speaker of the House should not be called that name.'</p>

<p>'I don't even want to use it again,' he continued.  </p>

<p>Later he tweeted, 'It disgusts me that she is called 'crazy Nancy.' She has spent her whole life in public services. My critics didn't listen to why i mentioned it-because it is horrifying.'  </p>

<p>During the interview, Pelosi waved it off, saying she had 'great respect' for the 'Mad Money' host. </p>

<p>'Don't worry about that, she offered. 'Let that be your biggest problem today.' </p>

<p>Some of Pelosi's allies weren't so keen on letting Cramer off the hook. </p>

<p>'This is the end of Jim Cramer as a serious finance commentator. He might as well hang it up and go to work for Fox,' tweeted former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean, sharing the video clip. </p>

<p>Criticism: A series of Democratic commentators and Trump critics slammed Jim Cramer</p>

<p>Backing from Trump world: The president's supporters - including Ryan Fournier, of Students for Trump - reveled in the use of the nickname</p>

<p>Journalist Joan Walsh called it 'appalling,' as Trump's 'Art of the Deal' ghost writer Tony Schwartz lambasted the president, saying he 'decimated civility and dragged all of us down with him.' </p>

<p>'Example: CNBC's awful Jim Cramer calls Speaker Pelosi 'crazy Nancy' to her face, as if that's OK to say to the speaker of the House,' Schwartz tweeted.    </p>

<p>During the interview, Pelosi also said she saw no point in calling up Trump in order to get another coronavirus relief bill deal. </p>

<p>'What is the point?' she asked Cramer. 'The president has sent his representatives and if he has confidence in them, than I do too.' </p>

<p>She called out Trump for his deceptions and proclivity for lying.  </p>

<p>'So if you're talking to him you're almost wasting your time,' she said. </p>

<p>Pelosi also pointed out that it had been under a year since she'd talked with Trump, having spoken to him last October and interacted with him at the early February State of the Union.   </p>

<p>May 2020</p>

<p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi  compares President Donald Trump to a little kid who comes in with doggy do on his shoes.</p>

<p>She describes Trump as 'a child who comes in with mud on his pants' when she was asked about his propensity to hurl insults at people - usually via Twitter. </p>

<p>'It's like a child who comes in with mud on their pants or something,' Pelosi said. 'He comes in with doggy doo on his shoes and everybody who works with him has that on their shoes too for a very long time to come.' </p>

<p>Pelosi says she didn't know President Donald Trump would be 'so sensitive' about his weight after she calls him 'morbidly obese' and he shoots back she has 'mental problems.'  The two were in a war of words after she questioned his taking of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against the coronavirus.</p>

<p>'I didn't know that he would be so sensitive. He's always talking about other people's avoirdupois, their weight, their pounds,' she said.</p>

<p>'Pelosi is a sick woman. She's got a lot of problems, a lot of mental problems,' President Trump said after she questioned his weight. </p>

<p>February 2020</p>

<p>After the impeachment inquiry was over, President Trump mocks Speaker Pelosi's faith at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C. </p>

<p>'I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say I pray for you when they know that's not so. So many people have been hurt, and we can't let that go on,' he said. </p>

<p>Pelosi, a devout Catholic, has repeatedly said she prays for the president. She sat at the head table during Trump's remarks and shakes her head. She purses her lips a few times as he spoke. </p>

<p>Also, President Trump refuses to shake Speaker Pelosi's hand earlier that month when he arrived in the House chamber to give his annual State of the Union address. </p>

<p>At the end of the speech she tears up the text of his remarks and throws the ripped pages on the floor. </p>

<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped apart her copy of President Trump's State of the Union address after he finished speaking</p>

<p>September 2019</p>

<p>Speaker Pelosi announces a formal House inquiry into the impeachment of President Trump. The House will vote on two charges against him but he is acquitted on both by the Senate. </p>

<p>October 2019</p>

<p>During a meeting at the White House on Syria, Speaker Pelosi and other top Democrats walk out.   </p>

<p>She accuses Trump of having a meltdown. 'We have to pray for his health - because this was a very serious meltdown,' she said. Democrats said Trump called Pelosi a 'third-rate politician' during the meeting.</p>

<p>Trump tweets official White House photographs from inside the meeting captioning one: 'Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!'</p>

<p>It shows his aides and the country's most senior military leader staring at the table as Pelosi, standing, points a finger toward Trump. Pelosi embraces the picture, later making that image her Twitter cover photo.  </p>

<p>Trump tweeted a picture taken by the White House photographer as evidence of what he claimed was Pelosi's 'unhinged meltdown'</p>

<p>May 2019 </p>

<p>Speaker Pelosi suggests President Trump's behavior is so erratic it requires an 'intervention' from his family and staff after he walks out of an infrastructure meeting at the White House with Democrats. She says he acted like a 'baby' in their sit-down.</p>

<p>'I wish that his family or his administration or his staff would have an intervention for the good of the country,' she said. </p>

<p>He questions her intellectual capacities after he walks out of meeting and straight into White House Rose Garden to complain about her to reporters.</p>

<p>'I'll tell you what, I've been watching her, and I have been watching her for a long period of time, she's not the same person. She's lost it,' Trump said.</p>

<p>'I haven't changed very much. Been very consistent. I am an extremely stable genius,' he notes. </p>

<p>December 2018</p>

<p>In an Oval Office meeting on an impending government shut down, the two bicker over Trump's request for funding for his border wall. </p>

<p>'Mr. President,' Pelosi told him at one point, 'please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.' </p>
