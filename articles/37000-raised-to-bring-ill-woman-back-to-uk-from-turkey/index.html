        <p>Insurers have backed down and agreed to cover a British mother's £10,000-a-day hospital bills as she fights for her life in a Turkish hospital - as her daughter thanks the Good Samaritans who raised £37,000 for a flight home. </p>

<p>Stephanie Uyar said her dream holiday turned into a 'horror movie,' after her mother collapsed at her husband's home and was given just 48 hours to live on August 18.</p>

<p>Since then Carole Fleming, 67, has been in the hospital with a blood disorder related to a potential bone marrow deficiency. </p>

<p>The British Consulate had said they will not repatriate the breast cancer-survivor while she is still alive, Stephanie claimed, </p>

<p>Her family say insurer Axa initially refused to pay the the hospital bills - due to a link to her previous illness.</p>

<p>The desperate daughter launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise £25,000 for a commercial air ambulance to bring the mother-of-two back to Britain and into the hands of the NHS. </p>

<p>Since MailOnline shared the family's appeal last night, they have raised over £37,000 - and Axa have agreed to start paying the medical bills.</p>

<p>Speaking today, Mrs Uyar, 36, said: 'This morning, the Doctors at Mugla Hospital told me it was now or never – either we start Mum on the desperately-needed IVIG treatment, or she dies today.</p>

<p>'It was as simple at that. </p>

<p>British mother Carole Fleming, 67, (pictured in hospital) is fighting for her life in a Turkish hospital after coming down with a mystery illness</p>

<p>Carole's daughter Stephanie Uyar (pictured together in Turkey), launched a desperate fundraiser to try and pay for her mother's treatment and get her home  </p>

<p>'When we first asked MailOnline for help, our GoFundMe page was stuck on £4,000 and nobody was listening to us.</p>

<p>'Less than 24 hours later, we've raised over £37,000 to give mum the lifeline she deserves.</p>

<p>'The money you helped us raise by donating so generously to our GoFundMe page means that she is starting her IVIG treatment as I write this from an uncomfortable hospital chair.</p>

<p>'We are truly humbled by the way that thousands of total strangers pulled together and did their bit to bring our beloved mum home.</p>

<p>'Your kindness in our darkest hour is an extraordinary testament to the human spirit, and has brought us more hope and comfort than we could ever fully convey.</p>

<p>'As wonderful as today's news is, we're not out of the woods yet. After the MailOnline story went viral, AXA promised to do their bit to bring her home – but even with the treatment, she's not stable enough to fly on an air ambulance.' </p>

<p>Carole Fleming (middle right) pictured with her daughter Elizabeth (bottom left), was visiting in laws in Turkey, before she collapsed on August 18</p>

<p>Mrs Uyar said she feels like she's 'trapped in a horror movie'. Her mother's condition in intensive care in Muğla is so dire she 'cries blood' due to her body's inability to clot. Pictured: Ms Fleming with her son-in-law's mother Hilal</p>

<p>Ms Fleming's brother Ian, 55, claims medics in Turkey mistakenly believed his sister's illness was brought about by a medication related to her breast cancer - which she was recovered from last year. </p>

<p>The link to her previous condition meant her medical insurer would not cover the costs.</p>

<p>Earlier today her insurer, Axa, backed down.  </p>

<p>Doctors backtracked when they took Ms Fleming off the medication and her condition got worse. </p>

<p>Ms Fleming was in Turkey visiting her daughter's husband Alper Uyar's family when she felt tired before collapsing on August 18. </p>

<p>She was rushed to hospital where doctors tested her blood. They found her platelet count was just 6,000 per microlitre of blood – the minimum safe level is 150,000. This means she's unable to form clots, and needs regular transfusions just to stay alive.</p>

<p>Mrs Uyar has thanked 'Carole's angels' who raised £30,000 in the space of a day  </p>

<p>She's been moved around several hospitals in Turkey. Her platelet count is now just 1,000 per microlitre.</p>

<p>Mrs Uyar said yesterday: 'In the last three weeks, there have only been two nights when I've not stayed by her side in a hospital chair.</p>

<p>'It's not even a duty, it's a reflex. After everything she's done for me the least I can do is be by her side.</p>

<p>'It's like I'm trapped in a horror movie. The things I've seen and witnessed in the last three weeks, I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy.</p>

<p>'No child should see their mother in a condition like that.</p>

<p>'To see the woman who's always been my rock, who's always been there to help me, to see her so vulnerable in a strange place. I'll have nightmares about this ward for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>'I've been trying to keep her mind off it by talking about EastEnders or gossiping about people we met on the beach, but it's hard to stay composed when I look up and see my mum like this.</p>

<p>'Her blood can't clot, so she has constant uncontrollable nosebleeds – sometimes she even cries blood. At one point her tongue was just one huge blood blister, she could barely talk.</p>

<p>'Back on August 18 the doctors gave her 48 hours to live. But she's a fighter, and she's still here – even though they don't know what's wrong with her yet. She's refusing to give up. She's told me she's not going to die in this hospital.</p>

<p>Ms Fleming was in Turkey visiting her daughter's husband Alper Uyar's family when she felt tired before collapsing on August 18. Pictured: Mr and Mrs Ulyar </p>

<p>'She'll make it home, somehow. I don't care what I have to do to make that happen, I'll do it.</p>

<p>'When the doctors said they couldn't start treatment without the money, I immediately asked if there was a form I could sign where they'd start it and if I didn't pay, I'd go to prison.</p>

<p>'I don't care how bad the prisons are out here. I don't care if it's 15 years, 20 years, 25 years – I'd do that time in a heartbeat if it gave mum a chance of making it.</p>

<p>'She's been my best friend for my entire life. She was there when I met my husband – we were on holiday in Turkey like best friends, and I tripped over outside Alper's shop, and he just caught me.</p>

<p>'It was like a movie – I think she knew on the spot that I'd marry him.</p>

<p>'I might lose my mum and my best friend because of an insurance loophole, and that's what's hardest to come to terms with.</p>

<p>'It's not right that my mum could be taken away because of a form in an office somewhere.</p>

<p>'I just hope the insurance underwriters have a heart and realise what's at stake.'</p>

<p>Mr Fleming told how Turkish doctors mistakenly revoked her cover by telling the insurance firm the low platelet count was down to Carole's breast cancer medication.</p>

<p>Mrs Uyar (right and left with her husband Alper, mother Ms Fleming and brother Alex Haworth before her mother fell ill) was trying to raise £25,000 for a commercial air ambulance to bring the mother-of-two - who is currently in intensive care in Muğla - back to Britain and into the hands of the NHS</p>

<p>He raged: 'They said Carole's issues were a side-effect of hormone tablets she was taking for her breast cancer recovery.</p>

<p>'But when she stopped taking them nothing changed. If anything, she got worse.</p>

<p>'The doctors admitted they were wrong and the insurance company is looking into her case, but these things take time.</p>

<p>'Every hour counts. At the moment all they can do is keep up the blood transfusions, but she needs immunoglobulin therapy just to get her in shape to fly home.</p>

<p>'That costs £10,000 a day. So far we've dug deep to pay £7,000, but that kind of money just isn't possible.</p>

<p>Mrs Fleming was rushed to hospital where doctors tested her blood. Mrs Fleming (left) with her son-in-law's parents Hilal and Osman</p>

<p>'The doctors are ready and waiting to start, but they can't do anything until they know who's paying for it. That's just how it works.</p>

<p>'It's such a difficult situation – if I was out in Turkey I would have lost my temper by now.</p>

<p>'Carole means the world to me. She helped raise me, she's more than just a sister.</p>

<p>'She's just an incredibly kind, incredibly warm, caring person.</p>

<p>'She spent her life helping disadvantaged kids into apprenticeships, and those success stories always gave her such a lift.</p>

<p>'After all she's done to help people, it's awful to think that she could die because of something like an insurance error.</p>

<p>Ms Fleming (right with Mr and Mrs Uyar) has been moved around several hospitals in Turkey. Her platelet count is now just 1,000 per microlitre</p>

<p>'Steph has been amazing throughout all of this, her and Alper are just such an incredibly warm, supporting people who would move heaven and earth to help Carole.</p>

<p>'She's going through hell, and probably feels like her mum is being unnecessarily ripped away.</p>

<p>'I'm trying to be strong for them, but I feel so helpless. So utterly helpless.</p>

<p>'There's nothing we can do from the UK. We're just sat here going around in circles while Carole is fighting for her life out in Turkey.</p>

<p>'We called the Foreign Office and they said there was nothing they can do – but then told us they'd "repatriate" her if she died.</p>

<p>'We're the fifth richest nation in the world. It's not that we don't have the means to fly a citizen home.' </p>
