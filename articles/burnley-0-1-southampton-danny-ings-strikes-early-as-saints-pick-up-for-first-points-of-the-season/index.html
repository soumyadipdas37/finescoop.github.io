        <p>Southampton’s Danny Ings pushed his claims for a first England start by scoring at former club Burnley to earn his side their first points of the season.</p>

<p>Ings, who spent four years at Turf Moor until joining Liverpool in 2015, exposed a depleted Burnley defence to cleverly fire Saints ahead early on.</p>

<p>The in-form striker’s two caps have both been off the bench but he’ll expect to be included in Gareth Southgate’s squad announced next Thursday and will hope to be in the XI for at least one of their games against Wales, Belgium or Denmark.</p>

<p>Danny Ings (right) celebrates scoring their first goal with team-mate Che Adams</p>

<p>Ings had the simple task of finish into an empty net with Burnley keeper Nick Pope stranded</p>

<p>The Burnley players could only watch on as Ings netted this third goal of the season </p>

<p>Burnley (4-4-2): Pope 6; Bardsley 6, Long 5.5, Dunne 5.5, Taylor 7; Stephens 6, Brownlow 6.5, Westwood 6, McNeil 6; Wood 7, Vydra 5.5</p>

<p>Subs: Peacock-Farrell (Gk), Lowton, Pieters, Thomas, Benson, Goodridge, Driscoll-Glennon</p>

<p>Booked: Bardsley</p>

<p>Southampton (4-4-2): McCarthy 6.5; Walker-Peters 7.5, Vestergaard 6, Bednarek 6, Bertrand 6; Djenepo 6.5 (Tella 77 6), Romeu 6, Ward-Prowse 6, Armstrong 6; Ings 7, Adams 7 (Obafemi 77 6)</p>

<p>Subs: Forster (Gk), Valery, Stephens, Smallbone, Tella, Obafemi, Long</p>

<p>Goal: Ings 5</p>

<p>Referee: Andre Marriner 5.5</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Burnley were without a number of key players on Saturday night and have now lost both their Premier League games this season.</p>

<p>Sean Dyche has been disgruntled about a lack of new signings but at least he was able to give £2million buy Dale Stephens his Clarets debut.</p>

<p>With neat symmetry, it was Stephens’ 100th Premier League appearance, the others coming at Brighton, in Dyche’s 400th game as a manager.</p>

<p>James Tarkowski was again absent as Leicester and West Ham continue to show interest while reports of an American takeover at Turf Moor rumble on.</p>

<p>Dyche’s bench was filled mainly with academy youngsters to underline the point why more recruits are needed before transfer deadline day.</p>

<p>Burnley manager Sean Dyche was without a number of key players on Saturday night</p>

<p>Southampton’s slow start to the season wasn’t reflected by manager Ralph Hasenhuttl making only two changes from the team beaten 5-2 at home by Spurs.</p>

<p>The visitors made a quick start and were rewarded by taking the lead with a fine goal after five minutes.</p>

<p>Kyle Walker-Peters advanced down the right and threaded a pass into Che Adams. He cleverly cut back for Ings who finished with typical composure from eight yards despite the best efforts of Jimmy Dunne to intercept.</p>

<p>It was the England forward’s third goal of the campaign and 26th since the start of last season – nobody has scored more in that period. It was also an example of how 4-4-2, a system both sides deployed last night, can work at its best.</p>

<p>Ings celebrates with his team-mates after scoring the opening goal in the fifth minute</p>

<p>Burnley, who uncharacteristically shipped four goals in their Premier League opener at Leicester, looked rocky with Nick Pope having an unfamiliar centre-back pairing of Kevin Long and Dunne in front of him.</p>

<p>Dunne, who only made his Premier League debut a week ago, was forced into a hurried clearance when more experienced colleagues allowed Ings and Adams to run through them.</p>

<p>Dyche was missing Ben Mee, Robbie Brady, Ashley Barnes and Jay Rodriguez besides Tarkowski but that shouldn’t deflect from Southampton’s impressive first-half performance with plenty of movement off the ball.</p>

<p>All Burnley offered only fleeting responses. Matej Vydra lashed over the bar but and Chris Wood appealed for a penalty fell after a nudge by Jan Bednarek that also had Dyche raising his arms.</p>

<p>Saints led Spurs until first-half injury time and ended up losing heavily. So Burnley knew they were in the game as long as they didn’t concede a second.</p>

<p>Defender Phil Bardsley needed treatment after being caught on his ear by Moussa Djenepo’s elbow in an aerial challenge but it was deemed accidental by the Saints winger.</p>

<p>Burnley started the second half sharper and Wood forced Alex McCarthy into a flying save in the opening minute. Bardsley then got his revenge on Djenepo with a hack that got the full-back a yellow card.</p>

<p>Charlie Taylor tested McCarthy and Wood was then staggered as he chased a long punt by Pope, dispossessed Ryan Bertrand and finished from an acute angle only for the whistle to have already been blown for offside.</p>

<p>It begged the question why Scott Ledger had raised his flag on a marginal call instead of letting the move run its course as instructed. But fortunately for them replays did show Wood off by the slenderest of margins. To add to the confusion, referee Marriner complained of headset malfunction in communicating with Mike Dean at Stockley Park.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Huge celebrations from Hasenhuttl. Southampton's first points of the season and their first win here since 1971.</p>

<p>Ings puts the ball in the net with a fine finish after being played in on the left but he was well offside.</p>

<p>There will be three minutes of added time.</p>

<p> Southampton look to launch a quick attack after winning the ball in their own half, but Ward-Prowse misplaces his pass towards Tella and Burnley now have a throw-in on their right wing.</p>

<p>Double substitution for the visitors as Adam and Djenepo are replaced by Nathan Tella and Michael Obafemi.</p>

<p>Waste.</p>

<p>Westwood intercepts the ball on the right and plays a quick through ball for Vydra.</p>

<p>Te Czech, who is capable of the spectacular, tries to catch the keeper off his line with an audacious chip but gets it all wrong.</p>

<p>Djenepo catches Bardsley late and is lucky not to receive a yellow.</p>

<p>A good battle between those two today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Close!</p>

<p>A ball is cleared into the path of Charlie Taylor ion the edge of the box and he lets fly with a fierce first-time effort whoch forces a great save out of McCarthy at his near post.</p>

<p>Almost his first Burnley goal.</p>

<p>Wood has the ball in the net but it won't count.</p>

<p>Bertand fails to deal with a long ball properly and Wood is able to run on to it and chip cutely over the keeper.</p>

<p>However, the lineman's flag is up for offside. </p>

<p>Bardsley picks up the game's second yellow as he catches Djenepo late.</p>

<p>The Saints man looks in some discomfort but is OK to carry on.</p>

<p>Chance for Burnley!</p>

<p>Almost the perfect start to the half as Westwood picks out Wood at the back post with a fine ball.</p>

<p>He tries to steer his header into the far corner but tghe keeper is able to dive and make the save.</p>

<p>Burnley get us back underway.</p>

<p>Close game here. Danny Ings with the only goal, against his former club.</p>

<p>There will be one minute of added time.</p>

<p>Brownhill takes an unintentional elbow to the rib from Romeu as they jump for the ball.</p>

<p>He's in some discomfort but no booking for the Saint mans.</p>

<p>Bertand continuing to cause problems.</p>

<p>He reaches the byline before whipping in another good ball to Ings, who can't quite control it and the danger is cleared.</p>

<p>Ashley Westwood whips in a right-footed free-kick from the left which almost catches out McCarthy and finds the top right corner.</p>

<p>Luckily for the Saints stopper it flies narrowly wide.</p>

<p>First booking of the game as Stuart Armstrong takes out Charlie Taylor on the left.</p>

<p>No complaints there.</p>

<p>Bardsley catches an elbow competing for a header with Djenepo. VAR has a look at it and decides against taking any action. </p>

<p>Bardsley needs a little patching up.</p>

<p>Penalty shout for Burnley as Chris Wood latches on to a fine long ball over the top from Bardsley.</p>

<p>The striker goes down under pressure but the referee isn't interested.</p>

<p>Dyche mot impressed.</p>

<p>Vydra attempts a spectacular bicycle kick but completely misses the ball. However, the defensive clearance falls back to him, allowing him a strike at goal, which goes well over the crossbar.</p>

<p>Half-chance for the home side as a cross reaches Brownhill at the back post. He heads the ball straight into a defender but the ball falls back to him. He swipes at it but it's deflected behind.</p>

<p>Chance for Southampton!</p>

<p>Djenepo and Bertand link up well on the left and the latter gets a good low cross in to Adams, who fires his first-time effort well over.</p>

<p>There real has only been one opening in this game so far and the visitors made the most of it.</p>

<p>Two structured sides cancelling each other out for the most part so far.</p>

<p>Burnley get the ball forward properly for the first time in the game. They force couple of corners but Southampton are up to the task on both occasions.</p>

<p>Ralph Hasenhuttl's side looking well organised so far.</p>

<p>First chance, first goal!</p>

<p>Che Adams is played through on the right and cuts it back for Danny Ings who is able to finish into an empty net under pressure.</p>

<p>What a start.</p>

<p>All players take the knee and Southampton get us underway.</p>

<p>Neither of tonight's teams are yet to pick up a point in this season's Premier League.</p>

<p>Burnley sit 16th, having played just once, losing 4-2 to Leicester.</p>

<p>Southampton, meanwhile, sit bottom after defeats to Crystal Palace and Tottenham.</p>
