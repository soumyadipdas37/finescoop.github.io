        <p>Viewers tuned into last night's SoccerAid commented on the 'irony of John Terry taking a knee,' as the former Chelsea star joined teammates in a show of solidarity for the Black Lives Matter movement - despite being fined for racism in the past. </p>

<p>England captain Olly Murs and the rest of the Soccer Aid players took the knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement during the annual charity game at Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday. </p>

<p>But it was the former Chelsea and England captain, John Terry, who caught the eye of viewers, as one commented 'the irony of John Terry taking a knee'.</p>

<p>In 2012, Terry, now a coach at Aston Villa, was fined £220,000 and banned for four games after calling Anton Ferdinand a 'f****** black c***,' during a match against Queen's Park Rangers in 2011.</p>

<p>A trial at Westminster Magistrates Court cleared Terry of racially abusing the defender.</p>

<p>American footballer Colin Kaepernick's national anthem kneeling protest staged in 2016 has since become synonymous with the movement.</p>

<p>Scroll down for video </p>

<p>Powerful: Olly Murs and fellow celebrity players showed their support towards the Black Lives Matter movement at annual charity game Soccer Aid at Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday</p>

<p>John Terry followed the players in taking the knee, nearly eight years after accepting a four game ban and £220,000 fine from the FA for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand</p>

<p>Premier League teams took the knee before games after the season restarted following the coronavirus shutdown and had Black Lives Matters on team shirts. </p>

<p>The England team also took the knee before Nations League games against Iceland and Denmark and the teams took the knee before last month's Community Shield.</p>

<p>It is unclear what is going to happen this season. Premier League clubs are due to discuss Black Lives Matter tributes at their next shareholders meeting later this month.</p>

<p>Sky Sports pundit Alex Scott has urged English football to press on with support for the campaign..</p>

<p>The former Arsenal women's star said clubs, players and staff should continue their displays against discrimination. </p>

<p>Making a statement: The captain for the England team, 36, knelt to the ground alongside the likes of Danny Jones, DJ Locksmith and Sergio Pizzorno as a symbol against racism (pictured)</p>

<p>'We need to keep it at the forefront': Sky Sports pundit Alex Scott has urged English football to press on with support for the campaign next season (pictured with Dermot O'Leary)</p>

<p>Unity: The former Chelsea captain, 39, was joined by (L-R) Lianne Sanderson, Kelly Smith and Tom Davis</p>

<p>Impressive: Thanks to the generosity of ITV viewers, Soccer Aid raised a record £11,552,577 – the most the match has ever generated in the history of the show</p>

<p>'We still need to keep the Black Lives Matter movement going,' former Strictly star Alex, 35, said after England's 1-0 win over Iceland in the Nations League on Saturday. </p>

<p>'Basketball players in the play-offs are boycotting games. We just need to keep going. We need to keep it at the forefront of people's conversation. So any opportunity we can, we need to shine a light on it.'  </p>

<p>Viewers took to Twitter to claim it was 'ironic' that Chelsea icon John Terry had also took the knee, nearly eight years after accepting a four game ban and £220,000 fine from the FA for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The sportsman was found not guilty of the racially aggravated public order offence in July 2012, nine months after the incident during Chelsea's defeat against QPR at Loftus Road. </p>

<p>Awkward: Viewers took to Twitter to claim it was 'ironic' that Chelsea icon John had also took the knee due to his past, while others disagreed</p>

<p>Social media users wrote: 'I enjoyed watching John Terry, a player banned for 4 games and fined over £200k for racist remarks during a match, take the knee for BLM #SoccerAid.</p>

<p>'John Terry taking a knee “in support” of black lives matter [confused emoji]. </p>

<p>'I missed the kick off. Twitter says John Terry took the knee - after what he said to Anton Ferdinand? Say it ain’t so? #SoccerAid.' </p>

<p>Others disagreed: 'People banging on about John Terry taking the knee for BLM....if he didn’t do it people would be making comments, guy can’t win can he?'</p>

<p>'Keep seeing posts about John Terry taking the knee as being hypocritical. That's the same John Terry who was found 'Not Guilty' in a court of law. That's also the same John Terry who has friends and former teammates who are of different ethnic backgrounds. Give it a rest!'  </p>

<p>Controversy: Others slammed viewers who stopped watching the event and donating towards the cause when they realised female footballers were playing and stars took the knee</p>

<p>'As I stated in the criminal case, with the benefit of hindsight my language was clearly not an appropriate reaction to the situation for someone in my position.</p>

<p>'My response was below the level expected by Chelsea Football Club, and by me, and it will not happen again. Looking forward, I will continue to do my part in assisting the club to remove all types of discriminatory behaviour from football.</p>

<p>'I am extremely grateful for the consistent support of Chelsea FC, the fans and my family.' </p>

<p>Rest of the World triumphed once again in penalty shootout as comedian Lee Mack missed from the spot for England for a third year in a row. </p>

<p>Wahay! Rest of the World triumphed once again in penalty shootout at as comedian Lee Mack missed from the spot for England for a third year in a row</p>

<p>The penalty shootout had been brought about by a 1-1 final score, following a game in which both sides had plenty of fun. </p>

<p>Soccer Aid raised a record £11,552,577 – the most the match has ever generated in the history of the show.  </p>

<p>'I think I'll pass!' Earlier in the event, Olly was left disappointed as Olivia Colman declined his offer to join the England football team</p>

<p>Pretty please? Speaking via a video call, the Voice judge attempted to persuade the award-winning actress, 46, to play in the match</p>

<p>Earlier in the event, Olly was left disappointed as Olivia Colman declined his offer to join the England football team in a funny sketch.</p>

<p>Speaking via a video call, he attempted to persuade the award-winning actress, 46, to play in the match, but the screen star made it clear she'd only be interested in taking part in TV, theatre and film roles. </p>

<p>The Voice judge later reached out to will.i.am, Dolly Parton, Alan Carr, Alison Hammond and Rylan Clark-Neal, before settling with comedian Joel Dommett.  </p>

<p>The hilarious skit kicked off with the former X Factor star approaching manager Sam Allardyce, joined by fellow coach Wayne Rooney, for advice on who to recruit for the group.</p>

<p>Olly's description of the job clearly confused The Crown star Olivia, who believed she was signing up for an acting stint. </p>

<p>'Do you have a script you can send me? I can research the striker and it can grow originally! Do you have Dame Judi on board?', the thespian asked, before the musician said: 'Just Mark Wright!'</p>

<p>An unimpressed Olivia boldly replied: 'I think I'll pass!'  </p>

<p>The desperate artist later called host Alan, 44, and This Morning's Alison, 45, who said respectively: 'Yes, I will manage your England team. My dad used to manage Northampton footcball club... I'm talking about my singing career, not football!' </p>

<p>Failing to find potential teammates, former Big Brother presenter Rylan, 31, added salt to the wound as he asked: 'I haven't got to wear one of them football shirts do I?, before American singer Dolly, 74, admitted: 'Sorry Olly, I'm working 9 to 5!'</p>

<p>Olly's fellow The Voice coach will.i.am, 45, was enthusiastic for the wrong reasons as he suggested: 'Every time we score, I want to sing and change our outfits. Who else is playing that sings? Come on bro, most of the time you're just on Instagram!'</p>

<p>'It's made me emotional see how far Soccer Aid has come. I'm very proud and patriotic.' </p>
