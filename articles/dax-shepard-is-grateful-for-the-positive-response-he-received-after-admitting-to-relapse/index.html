        <p>After admitting he had recently relapsed with Oxycodone, Dax Shepard is grateful for the positive response he has received from supportive fans.</p>

<p>Shephard, 45, confessed last week he had recently begun battling a dependence on painkillers once again, and since been met with an outpouring of love from fans.  </p>

<p>'My fears were the opposite of what the result was,' Shephard explained on the Monday episode of his podcast, Armchair Expert. '[I'm] struggling with some fraudulent feelings of receiving love based on a f**k-up. But at any rate, I'm really, really grateful and there's so many beautiful, nice people.'</p>

<p>Grateful: After admitting he had recently relapsed with Oxycodone, Dax Shepard is grateful for the positive response he has received from fans (pictured with wife Kristen Bell in 2019)</p>

<p>While admitting he was 'so grateful' for the support, Dax admitted the love initially felt odd to him.  </p>

<p>'I did have this kind of weird, just childhood emotional reaction which was like, "I'm being recognized for having failed and for having been weak." And I think it just circles back to not feeling worthy of love and kindness, maybe, I don't know. It wasn't just super easy for me to navigate.'</p>

<p>Shepard admitted on the Friday episode of Armchair Expert that he had relapsed with Oxycodone and kept it a secret while celebrating 16 years of sobriety.</p>

<p>On the episode, the actor discussed his history with painkillers and how he recently found himself battling a dependence on the pills again and keeping it a secret from those closest to him.  </p>

<p>Remorse: He admitted he felt immense guilt about hiding 'this enormous secret' and expressed regret for 'gaslighting' his wife Kristen Bell, and podcast co-host, Monica Padman (pictured with Bell in 2019)</p>

<p>He admitted he felt immense guilt about hiding 'this enormous secret' and expressed regret for 'gaslighting' his wife Kristen Bell, and podcast co-host, Monica Padman.</p>

<p>In the episode entitled 'Day 7' in reference to being seven day's sober when it was recorded on September 21, the actor began to explain what has been going on. </p>

<p>'I felt so terrible about the lying,' he said, adding, 'I was just very scared and I felt very, very lonely.'</p>

<p>The father-of-two said he was very proud of his making it 16 years with no alcohol or cocaine - and added that during his recent relapse he had no desire to take those substances. </p>

<p>Shepard said the problems started around six months ago after injuring his hand and shoulder, and then followed by a serious motorbike accident in August. He said he noticed he started 'getting shadier and shadier.'</p>

<p>'And I've not ever yet bought them,' he said. 'And then I do...For the last eight weeks maybe, I don't know…I'm on them all day. I'm allowed to be on them at some dosage because I have a prescription.  </p>

<p>'And then I'm also augmenting that. And then all the prescriptions run out and I'm now just taking 30 mil Oxys that I've bought whenever I decide I can do [it].' </p>

<p>Gratitude: On September 1 the Bless This Mess actor's family rallied around him as he marked 16 years sober, not knowing he was secretly battling a pill addiction</p>

<p>Shepard didn't think there was a big problem because he was managing his day-to-day responsibilities.</p>

<p>But his podcast co-host confronted him and he began lying to her. </p>

<p>'And I'm lying to other people and I know I have to quit,' he confessed. 'But my tolerance is going up so quickly that I'm now in a situation where I'm taking, you know, eight 30s a day, and I know that's an amount that's going to result in a pretty bad withdrawal. </p>

<p>'And I start getting really scared, and I'm starting to feel really lonely. And I just have this enormous secret.'</p>

<p>He tried to lower his dosage but didn't stick to the schedule he made for himself. </p>

<p>Secret: Shepard said didn't think there was a big problem because he was managing his day-to-day responsibilities. He tried to lower the dosage he was taking daily but then realized he needed help</p>

<p>'I now start getting pretty visibly detoxy and withdrawly,' he said. 'And I lie and start saying I'm having an arthritis flare up.' </p>

<p>One day he was in the car with Padman, about three weeks ago, and he finally admitted his problem.</p>

<p>'I'm gaslighting you and I know I am,' he told her. 'And I'm making you feel crazy and I'm making Kristen feel crazy.'</p>

<p>He then admitted everything to Bell and Padman and followed up with a Alcoholics Anonymous meeting where he cried as he revealed what had happened. </p>

<p>'It was very emotional,' he said about the meeting. 'It was a really surreal kind of experience.</p>

<p>'When it was over, I actually, mentally - for the first time in a very long time - felt optimistic,' he explained. </p>

<p>Proud: Kristen and her daughters celebrated Shepard's 16th 'sobriety birthday' on September 1</p>

<p>Sweetest thing: 'Happy Sobriety Birthday Dady,' their youngster scrawled in red marker. On the back she added the Harry Potter character Ron Weasley and a red heart-shaped balloon</p>

<p>'Because for the last - a long time - I've known intellectually that things were going to get worse, that each encounter with it has gotten more shady and more dangerous. And I recognize that the next go-round would be 'Oh, I can't get pills, let's snort heroin.''</p>

<p>Reflecting on his sobriety journey Shepard said, 'The huge gift that the 16 years did give me was, I used to be able to gaslight people daily, and it didn't bother me,</p>

<p>'And I've had a good 15 1/2 years, or maybe more, of maybe not gaslighting people, and I just don't have that tolerance for it.' </p>

<p>As he began to detox, he recalled, 'I'm sweating bullets; I'm jerky; my back kills. It's terrible,' </p>

<p>'I've never detoxed from opiates, and I have so much compassion for these junkies who have like f**king cycled through this 20-30 times.'</p>

<p>Shepard admitted his problems began when his father passed away in 2012.</p>

<p>Family man: Bell and Shepard share Delta, five, and Lincoln, seven</p>

<p>'Eight years into sobriety, I had not done a single shady thing,' he recalled of that year. 'I hadn't done anything gray.'</p>

<p>It was a difficult time for Shepard, he had been visiting his father who was undergoing cancer treatment in hospital. He also suffered a motorcycle accident on his way to the Parenthood set. </p>

<p>'I immediately called my sponsor, and I said, 'I'm in a ton of pain and I gotta work all day. And we have friends that have Vicodin,'' Shepard recalled. </p>

<p>'He said, 'OK, you can take a couple Vicodin to get through the day of work, but you have to go to the doctor, and you have to get a prescription, and then you have to have Kristen [Bell] dole out the prescription.''</p>

<p>The CHiPs star said he followed the advice but at one point he had to travel, without wife Kristen Bell, to see his dad.</p>

<p>Without his pills, Shepard says he ended up taking some Percocet - double the dose he would take of his usual pills - after giving his sick father a dose. </p>

<p>'You know, we had so little in common and so much f**king friction,' Shepard remembered. </p>

<p>Ouch! Shepard was recovering from a serious motorcycle crash which left him with four broken ribs in August</p>

<p>'But the no. 1 thing we had in common was we were both f**king addicts and we had never used anything together. And we sat there stoned and looked at the lake. And in that moment, I felt elation and I was just happy.' </p>

<p>On September 1 the Bless This Mess actor's family rallied around him as he marked 16 years sober.</p>

<p>Bell took to Instagram to praise her other half for his hard work and dedication. </p>

<p>The Good Place star, 40, wasn't the only one giving Shepard congrats, she also shared a precious 'Happy Sobriety Birthday' card one of their daughters made for their dad in the post.</p>

<p>'Happy Sobriety Birthday Dady,' their youngster scrawled in red marker. On the back she added the Harry Potter character Ron Weasley and a red heart-shaped balloon.</p>

<p>Bell - who has been married to Shepard since 2013 - didn't say whether daughter Delta, five, or Lincoln, seven, was responsible for the sweet note.</p>

<p>She joined in the praise in her caption, writing: 'Today is my husband's 16th sobriety birthday. My daughter woke him up with this sign, and a sketch of the one and only Ronald Weasley(absolutely random, and also perfect).'</p>

<p>'Happy birthday Daxy. Thank you for dedicating your life to the hard and wonderful work of sobriety, so that we could share it with you.' </p>

<p>Scary: Shepard broke several ribs in a motorcycle last month </p>
