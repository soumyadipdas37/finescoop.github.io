    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>As England toiled here in Copenhagen, you couldn’t help but ponder what Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden were thinking back home in Manchester.</p>

<p>The team they had left in disgrace just 24 hours prior were labouring, void of any invention or craft whatsoever.</p>

<p>How Gareth Southgate could have done with his fledglings last night. That, above all else, should hurt Greenwood and Foden more than anything else.   </p>

<p>England were held to a goalless draw against Denmark in their Nations League match </p>

<p>Denmark missed a number of good chances to take the lead, and the match ended 0-0</p>

<p>Their team-mates were clearly in need of their own brand of youthful genius, but neither were able to answer the call. What’s worse, they only have themselves to blame.</p>

<p>Denmark 4-3-3: Schmeichel, Skov, Christensen, Zanka, Wass, Delaney, Eriksen, Norgaard (Holbjerg 73), Braithwaite (Kjaer 82), Dolberg (Falk 76), Poulsen</p>

<p>Subs not used: Andersen, Vestergaard, Maehle, Dalsgaard, Lossl, Christiansen, Larsen, Cornelius, Roennow</p>

<p>Yellows: Braithwaite</p>

<p>England 3-4-3: Pickford, Alexander-Arnold (Maitland-Niles 87), Trippier, Coady, Gomez, Dier, Phillips (Grealish 76), Rice, Kane, Sterling, Sancho (Mount 60)</p>

<p>Subs not used: Ward-Prowse, Abraham, Pope, Mings, Keane, Ings, Henderson</p>

<p>But the unavailability of his two youngster, and the reasons behind it, was neither here nor there for the England manager as he watched his side struggle to lay a glove on Denmark during a truly forgettable night of international football.</p>

<p>Following the tumultuous events of the past fortnight, Southgate would have been relieved to turn his focus elsewhere for 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Last night’s clash would provide only temporary respite, of course. The repercussions of Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden’s clandestine meeting with two Icelandic models on Sunday will continue long into the future for England manager. </p>

<p>So, too, will the question marks over Harry Maguire’s integrity ahead of his re-trial next year. Southgate has all that to look forward to, or not as the case may be.</p>

<p>But that’s life as England manager, Southgate’s faced enough crises during his tenure to know the drill.</p>

<p>Winning football matches will help diminish whatever anxieties Southgate may suffer over how he navigates the headaches that lie ahead.</p>

<p>Judging by this performance, Southgate can add winning football matches to his list of headaches.</p>

<p>Here in Copenhagen, he took the opportunity to blood two new players - Kalvin Phillips and Conor Coady were handed their England debuts from the start as Southgate switched to a back-three. </p>

<p>Gareth Southgate gave debuts to four players, including Calvin Phillips and Conor Coady</p>

<p>These two got starts, but England failed to impress while playing a new system in the 3-4-3</p>

<p>Fans have been calling out for Jack Grealish's inclusion, and he came on as a substitute</p>

<p>England captain Kane reacts after his chance is cleared off the line in injury time</p>

<p>It’s a system Southgate is believed to be giving serious consideration to persisting with until next summer’s European Championships.</p>

<p>Coady certainly appeared to benefit from the formation switch as the Wolves central defender made an accomplished start to life on the international stage.</p>

<p>The fact this was his first time in an England senior shirt - or in the squad for that matter - made no odds to the Liverpudlian as he loudly set about organising his defence with authority.</p>

<p>He certainly wasn’t all talk either - three missile-like long range passes out to Trent Alexander-Arnold inside the opening 25 minutes all found their target to set England away on attacks.</p>

<p>Phillips, in contrast, didn’t necessarily find the transition from the Championship to international football straightforward.</p>

<p>His first attempted pass was wasteful, soon after he was disposed inside his own half as he tried to carry the ball away from his own area. </p>

<p>The whole point of an experiment is to see if something works, but for most of this match, England’s 3-4-3 didn’t.</p>

<p>The left wing back role was an issue. Kieran Trippier is right-footed and, with Eric Dier as the left centre half, there was no balance.</p>

<p>It was all a bit awkward and there was no rhythm to England’s passing.</p>

<p>In midfield, Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice are not dictators who are going to make things tick. It is not all down to them, though. This is a problem that England have had for a long time.</p>

<p>England were crying out for Jack Grealish, who only got 14 minutes off the bench. The issue? Gareth Southgate doesn’t see him as a central midfielder.</p>

<p>So it was very difficult for the front three. Harry Kane was feeding off scraps and Jadon Sancho was non-existent. A large part of that is the system and the rest of the team not being able to get them the ball.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There was also an appearance for Ainsley Maitland-Niles with a few minutes to go in the game</p>

<p>Kasper Dolberg and Christian Eriksen missed chances to give the hosts a precious win</p>

<p>But the Leeds midfielder wasn't the only England player who struggled for rhythm, either. Southgate’s men were largely comfortable - but Jadon Sancho's scuffed effort from Kieran Trippier’s clever corner in the 11th minute was all they had to show from the opening 35 minutes.</p>

<p>Indeed, their lack of creativity would certainly have been a concern for Southgate following this insipid first half display.</p>

<p>Alexander-Arnold had threatening openings down the right, Raheem Sterling had his moments down the opposite flank.</p>

<p>But those moments were too infrequent - and when England were in a position to penetrate the final pass was rushed or misjudged.</p>

<p>England had their goalkeeper to thank for keeping them on level terms at half time, Jordan Pickford’s save to deny Kasper Dolberg in the 38th minute after Christian Eriksen made his former Tottenham team-mate Eric Dier look a fool provided the highlight of the first-half. </p>

<p>It was a frustrating night for Harry Kane, who had a chance cleared off the line at the death</p>

<p>Kieran Trippier was in the wars, especially after a clash of heads in training earlier in the day</p>

<p>Southgate’s decision to deploy two holding central midfielders in Phillips and Declan Rice appeared to be stunting England’s creative flow.</p>

<p>England faced a similar problem in Iceland, having to rely on Sterling’s late penalty to earn them victory last weekend.</p>

<p>Yet, Southgate refused any temptation to alter his personnel or system at half-time.</p>

<p>Blind faith? It appeared so, England started the second half just as disjointed as they finished the first.</p>

<p>This performance was in need of inspiration. Southgate’s first change arrived on the hour, Mason Mount replacing Sancho, who has flattered to deceive during England’s visit to Scandinavia, as the England manager tried to add some pizazz to a midfield that was workmanlike at best. </p>

<p>Joe Gomez of England puts the pressure on Denmark's Dolberg in the second half of the game</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling takes the knee with his team-mates in support of the fight against racism</p>

<p>Kane’s back post header from Trippier’s deep cross in the 69th minute followed by Sterling’s long-range effort that was turned behind by Kasper Schmeichel soon after at least provided some attacking punch.</p>

<p>But the fact Sterling’s effort - that arrived in the 70th minute - was England’s first on target of the night told its own story.</p>

<p>Jack Grealish replaced Phillips in the 76th minute for his England debut as Southgate searched of further inspiration.</p>

<p>Denmark could have wrapped victory in the 81st minute - Eriksen blazing over from close range after Yussuf Poulsen’s knock back.</p>

<p>But Harry Kane, who was deprived of service all night, was brilliantly denied by Mathias Jorgensen’s brilliant goalline clearance with virtually the last kick of the game as England threatened to snatch a dramatic - but undeserved - victory. </p>

<p>Sportsmail's MATT PORTER provided live Nations League coverage including score, lineups and build-up, with full commentary of the match. </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>A goalless draw then, but at least it wasn't any worse for Gareth Southgate's men. They'll play an important game against Belgium as they aim for the top of the group next month.</p>

<p>Keep an eye out for Sportsmail's full match report of Denmark v England coming soon</p>

<p>And we've limped across the finish line. The second half was marginally better for England, but they still haven't scored a goal from open play in the tournament so far...</p>

<p>Four debuts for England players tonight, so perhaps some hope for the future in there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Belgium have pulled away at the top of the group with their big 5-1 win over Iceland</p>

<p>90+4 min: The ball comes out to Grealish, and then to Gomez, who puts a cross through to Trippier. The linesman says it's gone out of play though... and that should be that</p>

<p>90+3 min: Final attack then for England... Harry Kane has the ball, Schmeichel has a moment of madness and is in no man's land! Kane rolls it in but... off the line!</p>

<p>90 min: Any late drama? Trippier delivers, it's pinged high into the air, but the referee calls for a foul after Kane pushed his man</p>

<p>89 min: Maitland-Niles is forward, and uses his strength to get on the end of a long ball. Kane tries a shot as the ball runs to him, but it's gone wide thanks to a deflection</p>

<p>Another one some fans have been looking forward to</p>

<p>86 min: Not long to go now, and this could still go either way. It's brought down in the box, and Kane comes up with it, carrying it out. But England still can't get anything going forward</p>

<p>81 min: Eriksen, who's been on good form tonight, wastes an opportunity as the ball falls to him kindly in the box. He tries to volley from around the penalty spot, but it's well over the bar. Gomez was close to putting in a challenge... but not that close</p>

<p>80 min: Sterling still has his pace, but can't find a route through into the box. England come again though, this time sub Grealish weaving his way into the box, but Denmark clear at the last moment</p>

<p>What a lot of fans have been waiting for... Can he take advantage of some tiring legs?</p>

<p>74 mins: Players are starting to find a little more space as we head towards the final 15 minutes... Will there be more late drama like there was against Iceland?</p>

<p>69 min: Kane finds a cross at the back post, but it's just sailing over the top of him and he can't get his header underneath the bar. One of England's better chances though...</p>

<p>Another decent effort from Sterling moments later, as Schmeichel gets down low to push the ball wide</p>

<p>65 min: Eriksen dances his way into the box, but Alexander-Arnold is able to get the ball away. However, Denmark come back and win a free-kick in a dangerous position... It's a little too far out for a shot, but Eriksen goes for it anyway and blasts it over the bar</p>

<p>60 min: Sterling lifts a ball over the box for Harry Kane, who's in acres of space in the box. He gets a shot away which is blocked by Schmeichel... but he was offside anyway</p>

<p>Ah here we go... here comes Mason Mount</p>

<p>58 min: A simple pick up for Pickford as Delaney tries a long range shot which doesn't have much power behind it.</p>

<p>So far, it's been much of the same. Surely there are substitutions on the horizon?</p>

<p>54 min: Trippier, who is already sporting a black eye from his clash in training earlier today, will have another bruise to take back to Spain after a heavy, but fair challenge. He gets a bit of treatment but is ready to continue</p>

<p>52 min: Rice puts a foot in to grab the ball and England come on the attack. Kane and Sancho link up, and then it's a wayward challenge from Braithwaite, who goes into the referee's book. Dier got away with a similar one a few minutes ago...</p>

<p>50 min: A bit of space for England, and now Sterling has a chance to show off some footwork. He tries to feed Trippier, but Denmark put it out for a throw in</p>

<p>48 min: Sterling tries to beat his man for pace, but brings down Wass on his way. The referee calls the foul, and doesn't pay any mind to the Englishman's complaints</p>

<p>Alright, here we go. Denmark get us underway and immediately get forward as Eriksen tries a shot from distance, which is blocked</p>

<p>No subs just yet</p>

<p>Denmark definitely had the better 45 minutes of the two teams, with three decent chances. England meanwhile haven't had much to be happy about</p>

<p>45 min: Similar situation here for England. Alexander-Arnols sends it in... but there's no one near it, despite the number of England players around</p>

<p>43 min: Good position for Denmark with not long left in the first half. It's sent into the box, and comes back out again for a throw in. Eventually it comes to nothing, but England can't keep giving their opponents these opportunities</p>

<p>38 min: Beautiful turn from Eriksen, who dribbles into the box past his former team-mate Dier. He feeds Dolberg who should do better, but Pickford palms it wide. England clear both resulting corners, and it was Kane both times who's just happy to be involved</p>

<p>36 min: Sterling gets the ball in a good position, and dribbles to the edge of the six yard box at the byline. He tries to sneak a cross in to Kane, but Denmark have bodies back and get it clear</p>

<p>34 min: The long ball is England's only outlet at the moment. Both Coady and Gomez are showing off their passing prowess, but once it gets downfield England still can't get anything going. Not enough creativity through the middle yet</p>

<p>31 min: Braithwaite takes a couple of great touches to take the ball away from Phillips, and he shoots low just past Pickford's post. More worrying signs for England</p>

<p>27 min: Kane is cutting a frustrated figure. He's having to come all the way back to the halfway line to get the ball most of the time, and when he does get forward he doesn't have many options around him.</p>

<p>Eric Dier tries the miracle pass through the middle, and it's hit way too hard</p>

<p>Unimpressive so far from England. If it stays like this you have to expect some changes at half time</p>

<p>20 min: More danger for England, as Denmark get forward in numbers. It's hectic in the box, but Poulsen can't bring the ball under his feet for the shot</p>

<p>19 min: Dolberg finds himself in some space and lashes a shot from the edge of the box, and it's just inches over the bar and Pickford's fingertips. Half a chance, but the best effort we've had so far</p>

<p>16 min: Wonderful ball across to Alexander-Arnold from Coady, and his cross looks dangerous, but it's just too close to the keeper.</p>

<p>14 min: A long way out, but potential for a shot... Skov skies it</p>

<p>13 min: Christensen lifts the ball towards Poulsen in the box. Very route one, and it nearly comes off, but he's not quite tall enough to get his head on it</p>

<p>11 min: Alexander-Arnold ventures forward for the first time and wins a corner for his team. Trippier delivers low towards Sancho on the penalty spot, but he doesn't get a clean connection on his shot, and it's cleared away. Pitch looking a bit bobbly there</p>

<p>9 min: Kane has started dropping deeper to help England keep possession, and finally they get something going down the left with Sterling. Denmark get it clear, but England can now start a press of their own</p>

<p>7 min: Sterling is brought down again, but England can't get anything going forward just yet. A real test for the 3-4-3 at the moment</p>

<p>5 min: Denmark have had the majority of possession so far, with nearly all the action taking place inside England's half. They're looking lively, but we'll have to see how long they can keep these energy levels up. Nothing too troubling for England's defence so far. Sterling then tries to get off to the races, and is pulled back for a free kick.</p>

<p>3 min: Phillips leaps into action on his debut, cutting in front of his man to steal the ball and get England going downfield</p>

<p>2 min: Denmark are pressing high, and Joe Gomez almost gets into trouble near his own corner flag, but his team-mates bail him out</p>

<p>1 min: Early free kick to Denmark in their own box as Sancho tries to wrestle his way in behind</p>

<p>England get us underway after the players take a knee to highlight the fight against racism. 90 minutes of Nations League action to come</p>

<p>The teams are heading out onto the pitch, ready for the national anthems</p>

<p>England will be running a new system tonight, a 3-4-3 with Trippier and Alexander-Arnold pushing forward and able to drop back when necessary. Expect Sancho on the right, Sterling on the left, and Kane in the middle of the front three. We haven't seen this from Southgate for a while... will it be a good gamble this evening?</p>

<p>Here's England boss Gareth Southgate speaking to Sky Sports about the commotion in the England camp:</p>

<p>'We have had total focus. We dealt with everything yesterday as soon as we left the hotel in Iceland. The players had already trained well and they know that is something they can’t affect. It is something that brings the group tighter together...</p>

<p>'I was fortunate enough to hand two players their first England shirt today, and we just talked a little about what the badge means. The requirements. To leave the shirt in a better place than you found it. And they know the responsibility that comes with it and the privilege and honour.'</p>

<p>Plenty of other Nations League matches going on tonight, and we've got you covered for all those updates as well.</p>

<p>England fans will be interested in the other match in League A Group 2 as Belgium host Iceland. Belgium are ahead of England on goal difference, but the Three Lions will be hoping to overcome that deficit this evening. </p>

<p>Conor Coady and Kalvin Phillips will be looking to impress on their debuts, and they're out on the pitch warming up right now.</p>

<p>...and the teams are in the building</p>

<p>📍 Parken StadiumThe boss and the boys have arrived! pic.twitter.com/6DLpXFrldM</p>

<p>There have been plenty of off-field incidents over the years. Can Gareth Southgate steer his men despite all the drama? </p>

<p>Here's a rundown of all the controversial moments surrounding the England team...</p>

<p>Kieran Trippier is starting then, despite an unfortunate accident in training earlier today... </p>

<p>Starting XI: Schmeichel, Skov, Christensen, Zanka, Wass, Delaney, Eriksen, Norgaard, Braithwaite, Dolberg, Poulsen</p>

<p>Here's why Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood were sent back to the UK this week</p>

<p>Starting XI: Pickford, Alexander-Arnold, Trippier, Coady, Gomez, Dier, Phillips, Rice, Kane, Sterling, Sancho</p>

<p>Subs: Mings, Pope, Keane, Maitland-Niles, Ward-Prowse, Grealish, Mount, Abraham, Ings, Henderson</p>

<p>No Phil Foden or Mason Greenwood of course, after their Covid-restriction-breaking antics in the team hotel this week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are debuts for Conor Coady and Kalvin Phillips.</p>

<p>Two debutants in the #ThreeLions starting line-up tonight!Congratulations, lads 👏 pic.twitter.com/N1hUpqcu1m</p>
