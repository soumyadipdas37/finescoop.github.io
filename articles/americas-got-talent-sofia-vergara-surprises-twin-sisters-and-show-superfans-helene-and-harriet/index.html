        <p>Sofia Vergara surprised two beloved superfans by crashing their interview with producers on Wednesday's episode of America's Got Talent.</p>

<p>Twin sisters Helene and Harriet were stunned when the Colombian actress, 48, walked into a room where they had been watching their favorite show on a TV.</p>

<p>At first, the pair kept cheering for Peruvian twin singers Double Dragon, who were still singing onscreen, but then the tape paused.</p>

<p>Surprising superfans: Sofia Vergara surprised two beloved superfans by crashing their interview with producers on Wednesday's results episode of America's Got Talent</p>

<p>'Why did it stop?' asked Sofia, a major Double Dragon fan, creeping in with a bowl of popcorn. 'That was the best part, no?'</p>

<p>The sisters, who became AGT favorites after cameras showed them at every taping this season, gasped as Sofia perched herself on the arm of their couch, a safe distance away.</p>

<p>'Hello!' came another knock on the door. 'You're going to party without me?' </p>

<p>Heidi Klum, 47, then walked in, and the sisters covered their mouths in amazement.</p>

<p>Twin sisters: Twin sisters Helene and Harriet were stunned when the Colombian actress, 48, walked into a room where they had been watching their favorite show on a TV</p>

<p>The German model revealed that her husband, musician Tom Kaulitz, 31, was an identical twin just like Helene and Harriet.</p>

<p>'OMG!' yelled Howie Mandel, 64, as he entered with a pizza, followed by show host Terry Crews, 52, who came bearing flowers.</p>

<p>'Harriet and Helene!' Terry cried. 'I love you guys!'</p>

<p>Second surprise: Heidi Klum, 47, then walked in, and the sisters covered their mouths in amazement</p>

<p>Viewing party: 'OMG!' yelled Howie Mandel, 64, as he entered with a pizza</p>

<p>Howie observed that Helene and Harriet's neighbor was 'so angry, because he pulled flowers out of their garden.'</p>

<p>The group giggled as they watched Sofia's ventriloquism act from a few weeks ago, which had her joking that she was 'a natural.'</p>

<p>Helene and Harriet had not attended a live taping since March, when AGT closed its set to audience members because of the coronavirus epidemic.</p>

<p>Good times: The group giggled as they watched Sofia's ventriloquism act from a few weeks ago, which had her joking that she was 'a natural</p>

<p>The host: Terry Crews brought flowers for the superfans</p>

<p>Howie noted that the one thing all of the judges missed during season 15 was being with fans in studio.</p>

<p>'And if the audience doesn't come to you…' he cracked.</p>

<p>The judges said goodbye and left, leaving one of the twins to blurt, 'Well that's heart attack material.'</p>

<p>Memorable moment: The judges said goodbye and left, leaving one of the twins to blurt, 'Well that's heart attack material'</p>

<p>During the results show, five of the 11 acts who performed on Tuesday's AGT episode would be sent through to the program's finals, airing in two weeks.</p>

<p>Terry emphasized that performances in the semifinals had to be stellar for people to survive.</p>

<p>He also noted that the high level of competition had inspired even the judges to get creative.</p>

<p>Heidi was then shown dancing ballet-style around an easel as she painted a giant, brightly colored butterfly.</p>

<p>Sofia sighed when her pal unveiled the art, saying, 'Heidi you really do everything good.'</p>

<p>The show also boasted appearances by famed magicians David Copperfield and Piff the Magic Dragon, as well as season 14 finalists the Ndlovu Youth Choir.</p>

<p>Virtual episode: The results show included some acts appearing remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Terry kicked the evening off in dramatic fashion, calling the Spyros Bros., a diabolo-slinging act, to the stage, along with the 49-member Dance Town Family.</p>

<p>'The first act going through is…. None of you,' he revealed, as the contestants' faces fell.</p>

<p>Terry gave the first spot instead to Broken Roots, a Chicago-based singing duo made up of pals Joey Kar and Austin Edwards.</p>

<p>Brandon Leake, a 27-year-old poet from Stockton, California, was next to go through, winning his slot for a piece about a father and son's estrangement.</p>

<p>'You are the king of spoken word,' Howie told him. 'There aren't any words that I can give you that would add anything to what you do. You just gotta keep doing what you do.'</p>

<p>Roberta Battaglia, an 11-year-old singer from Toronto, also made the finals on the strength of her mature, confident cover of Pink's What About Us.</p>

<p>The tween sobbed as she heard the news, pronouncing herself 'so grateful' for the votes.</p>

<p>'Just be yourself, because you're so perfect,' said Sofia, who had given Roberta her Golden Buzzer during the audition rounds. 'Every time you come out, you come better and better.'</p>

<p>Brazilian acrobat Alan Silva then made it through, winning the Dunkin' Save vote for his work on Tuesday's show, which saw him hanging from chains and flying around a stage.</p>

<p>The diminutive performer, who'd been bullied much of his life, cried tears of joy.</p>

<p>The fifth act to make it was Archie Williams, the 59-year-old singer from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who'd spent 36 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of a crime.</p>

<p>Getting emotional: Brazilian acrobat Alan Silva then made it through, winning the Dunkin' Save vote for his work on Tuesday's show, which saw him hanging from chains and flying around a stage</p>

<p>He earned the judges' vote to win his spot in the finals after facing off against the other remaining member of the Dunkin' Save group, Malik DOPE, 27, an electrifying drummer from Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>'Archie, you've had most of your life taken away from you so I'm not gonna do it to you right now,' Heidi announced, after Sofia also chose him. 'I'm gonna pick you, Archie.'</p>

<p>During a break in the show's announcements, a familiar face came back to do some tricks.</p>

<p>Piff the Magic Dragon, aka 40-year-old British magician John van der Put, had lost AGT in 2015, but recently starred in a show on the Las Vegas strip.</p>

<p>Suddenly, David Copperfield, the 21-time Emmy-winning magician, appeared out of nowhere and helped him finish the skit.  </p>
