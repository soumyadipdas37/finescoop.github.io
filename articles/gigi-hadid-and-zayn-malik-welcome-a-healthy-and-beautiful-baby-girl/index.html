        <p>Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have welcomed their first child, a baby girl.</p>

<p>The One Direction stand-out announced the birth in a touching social media post on Wednesday, calling their precious gift 'healthy and beautiful.'</p>

<p>'Our baby girl is here, healthy &amp; beautiful' the 27-year-old Pillowtalk singer wrote along with a black and white photo of his heavily tattooed hand holding on to his and the 25-year-old supermodel's pride and joy.</p>

<p>'To try put into words how i am feeling right now would be an impossible task. The love i feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine, &amp; thankful for the life we will have together x'</p>

<p>Shortly after mama Gigi shared her own touching message, writing: 'Our girl joined us earth-side this weekend and she’s already changed our world. So in love.'</p>

<p>Precious: Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have welcomed their first child, a baby girl </p>

<p>Parental pride! 'Our baby girl is here, healthy &amp; beautiful' the 27-year-old Pillowtalk singer wrote along with a black and white photo of his heavily tattooed hand holding on to his pride and joy </p>

<p>Baby girl: Shortly after mama Gigi posted her own touching message, sharing: 'Our girl joined us earth-side this weekend and she’s already changed our world. So in love'</p>

<p>New granddad: Gigi's father Mohamed used the word 'Jido' in his comment, which means 'grandfather' in Arabic</p>

<p>Friends, family and fans flocked in to send their love.</p>

<p>Gigi's father Mohamed shared a sweet comment on Gigi's post, writing, 'Congrats .. Jido's heart belongs to you.. baby girl.'</p>

<p>The real estate developer used the word 'Jido' in his comment, which means 'grandfather' in Arabic.</p>

<p>Along with a slew of hearts, Hailey Bieber wrote: 'Welcome babygirl!! So happy for you guys.'</p>

<p>Emily Ratajkowski said: 'Congratulations Gigi and Zayn' with several crown emojis. </p>

<p>Model Devon Windsor was tickled, sharing: 'Sooooo tiny and delicious!!!'</p>

<p>Yara Shahidi and Hailey Clauson sent simple 'Congratulations!' </p>

<p>Love fest: Friends, family and fans flocked in to send their love in the comments</p>

<p>Word Gigi and Zayn were expecting first emerged in April after a 'family source' spilled the beans about the IMG beauty and her on/off boyfriend of five years. </p>

<p>Shortly after she confirmed the news herself. </p>

<p>Gigi said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. </p>

<p>'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.' </p>

<p>Gigi seemed to hint that her child was on the way at the end of August when she shared a stunning photo of herself at 33-weeks.</p>

<p>At the time it was unclear whether she was counting down from the time of the post or the photoshoot.</p>

<p>Expecting the best! The couple's baby news first emerged back in April from a 'family' source </p>

<p>Growing bump: Gigi shared throwback photos from her 27th week of pregnancy last week</p>

<p>And her parents have been keeping fans on edge with their hints about the impending birth.</p>

<p>Father Mohamed had the world talking when he appeared to announce the baby's arrival after sharing a tender poem for his grandchild on Instagram last week.</p>

<p>But he later clarified that the family was still waiting when asked if Gigi had in fact given birth in the comment section.</p>

<p>When a fan wondered 'Did Gigi give birth to her baby, please can anyone answer,' he said 'No, not yet.' </p>

<p>Overjoyed: The model's father Mohamed Hadid posted a tender note for his future grandchild on Instagram earlier this month, making people think the baby had arrived</p>

<p>Jumping the gun! He later clarified that the family was still waiting when asked if Gigi had given birth in the comment section</p>

<p>Mom Yolanda Hadid furthered the gossip with her own post last week as well.</p>

<p>The retired model looked thrilled about being a grandma as she rested on her head on her daughter's belly in a stunning black and white set of photos.</p>

<p>Alongside the sweet black and white photos, the 56-year-old Dutch model said she was 'waiting patiently for her angel to be born.' </p>

<p>Sister Bella Hadid, 23, couldn't hide her excitement either, taking to social media earlier this month to share a photo with her glowing sister.</p>

<p>Fans began wondering if Gigi and Zayn had welcomed their child after Bella's throwback, which she captioned: with a baby angel emoji and:  'I love you both so freaking much -can’tstopcrying.'</p>

<p>Waiting: Mom Yolanda Hadid furthered the gossip with her own post last week as well</p>

<p>Two tummies: Younger sister Bella Hadid, 23, posted a throwback photo with her pregnant sibling earlier this month, giving fans another reason to believe the baby had arrived</p>

<p>Things have been going well for the couple as they readied themselves to start a family.</p>

<p>An insider told Us Weekly magazine last month that the couple had been getting along great ahead of the birth of their baby girl.</p>

<p>'[They are] closer than ever. Gigi has been living at her mom’s farm with Zayn,' the source revealed. 'She came back to NYC recently but she plans to spend most of her pregnancy there at the farm.'</p>

<p>The couple spent much of her pregnancy at her mother Yolanda farm in Pennsylvania, where her family isolated during the pandemic. </p>

<p>The baby girl seems to be just the start for the young family.</p>

<p>Back in May People said the celebrity couple 'plan to have a large family.'</p>

<p>Partners: An insider told Us Weekly magazine last month that the couple was 'closer than ever' during the pregnancy</p>

<p>'They've been through their ups and downs, but neither stopped caring about the other.'</p>

<p>Of expanding their brood, they went on: 'They've jumped on the timing of having a baby and are preparing for their new lives.</p>

<p>'Gigi is young but always said she wants several kids. She's sensitive and nurturing and will be a great mom.' </p>

<p>Hadid and Malik's relationship has not always been perfect.</p>

<p>The duo began dating in in November 2015, three months after the musician called off his engagement to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards. </p>

<p>But after just over two years together, the couple confirmed their break-up on Twitter in March 2018.</p>

<p>The pair reconciled in December of 2019 after a year long split, during which time Gigi briefly dated former Bachelorette contestant Tyler Cameron. </p>

<p>November 2015: Romance rumours first swirled between Gigi Hadid, 25, and Zayn Malik, 27, who are expecting their first child together, when they were spotted exiting Justin Bieber's American Music Awards after-party together.  </p>

<p>Going public? Gigi and Zayn appeared in his steamy music video for his 2016 song "Pillowtalk"</p>

<p>January 2016: The pair added further fuel to the fire when Gigi appeared in Zayn's steamy "Pillowtalk" music video. Although Zayn says the pair are "just good friends" they are pictured holding hands together.</p>

<p>February 2016: During a radio interview with 'Zach Sang &amp; The Hang' Zayn appeared to confirm their relationship when the interviewers refer to Gigi as his girlfriend and he fails to correct them. </p>

<p>Glam couple: Zayn and Gigi attended the Met Gala together in 2016</p>

<p>April 2016: The burgeoning super couple take part in a shoot for Vogue where Zayn is referred to as Gigi's "real-life" boyfriend, and they attend the Met Gala together the following month. </p>

<p>June 2016: The first signs of trouble appear when reports claim Gigi and Zayn have split up. Just two weeks later, reports suggest they are back together again and have been on more of a "break" than officially splitting.  </p>

<p>July 2017: The couple face backlash when appearing on the cover of Vogue for an issue about being gender fluid, when neither of them identify as such, </p>

<p>It couple: Zayn and Gigi pictured heading for the Vogue Dinner for Paris Fashion Week in March 2017</p>

<p>September 2017: Having appeared in yet more fashion spreads together, the couple took their relationship to the next level by vacationing with Gigi's family including her mother Yolanda Foster, proving Zayn is a hit with the family.</p>

<p>March 2018: Following another report of a split, this time Gigi and Zayn confirm it themselves. Zayn posted on Twitter: "Gigi and I had an incredibly meaningful, loving and fun relationship and I have a huge amount of respect and adoration for Gigi as a woman and a friend," while Hadid wrote: "I'm forever grateful for the love, time, and life lessons that Z and I shared."</p>

<p>A hit with the family: The pair began vacationing together with Gigi's mother Yolanda</p>
