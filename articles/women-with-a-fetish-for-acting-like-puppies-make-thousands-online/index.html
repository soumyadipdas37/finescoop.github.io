        <p>A former optician who has a fetish for acting like a dog is making six figures a month off of her puppy play videos in which she barks, crawls on all fours, and chews toys — and she isn't the only woman who is drawn to the sexual subculture. </p>

<p>Jenna Phillips, 21, from Austin, Texas, is best known as 'Puppy Girl Jenna' on TikTok, where she has earned more than 196,000 fans since March, thanks to her playful videos that show her doing everything from being walked on a leash to getting scolded for 'peeing' on the floor. </p>

<p>She parlayed her online fame into a lucrative gig on her Only Fans page, which earns her thousands of dollars a month. Speaking with Vice, she admitted that she has been surprised by her sudden success. </p>

<p>Scroll down for video  </p>

<p>Puppy play: Jenna Phillips, 21, from Austin, Texas, has a fetish for acting like a puppy. She is best known as 'Puppy Girl Jenna' on TikTok, where she has earned more than 196,000 fans </p>

<p>Big money: The former optician makes six figures a month off of her custom videos and exclusive content featured on her Only Fans page</p>

<p>'It’s insane,' she told the publication over Twitter DMs. 'I never thought my weird dog kink would be looked at by a broad audience, or that so many people would like/care about it. It still blows my mind.'</p>

<p>In her most recent TikTok video, she can be seen excitedly panting and crawling across the kitchen as she makes her way toward her food and water bowls that sitting in a rack on the floor. </p>

<p>After taking a few bites of dog food, she tips the rack over with her teeth. She begins suggestively licking the food off of the ground and then spitting it out while eyeing up the camera. </p>

<p>Another that has been viewed over 1.1 million times shows Jenna on all fours and wearing a metal leash at an outdoor restaurant as she begs her 'owner' for table food. After he finally acquiesces, he gives her a bite of his leftover steak. </p>

<p>Puppy play is a subculture of BDSM in which a person or persons act like young dogs. The sexual subculture is more prevalent in the queer community, and some participants like to wear masks, hoods, muzzles, leashes, and other gear.     </p>

<p>All in: Puppy play is a subculture of BDSM in which a person or persons act like young dogs. Jenna said she has always enjoyed acting like a dog, even when she was younger </p>

<p>Role play: Jenna shares videos of herself doing everything from being walked on a leash to getting scolded for 'peeing' on the floor</p>

<p>However, there is no one way to engage in puppy play. It can be sexual or nonsexual, one can sport the gear or not, and a pup may or may not have a handler, someone who gives commands, such as speak and roll over, or sexual orders.  </p>

<p>Puppy play is often geared towards men, but cis, heterosexual women, like Jenna, who have become drawn to the fetish, have put a softer, more feminine spin on it.  </p>

<p>In a recent interview with The Mirror, Jenna explained that she just feels 'like a dog' and has always enjoyed acting like one.   </p>

<p>'I just want to roll around, play fetch, get head scratches, run around and play. All of that,' she said. 'I have always acted like a puppy but not in a sexual way at first. I used to pretend I was a puppy when I was growing up.</p>

<p>'I really love praise. I love hearing "good girl." It makes my heart melt every time,' she added. 'Looking back on it now, it's kind of always been there. I just didn't know there was a scene, I just thought it was my personality.'</p>

<p>Hungry? One popular TikTok video shows Jenna on all fours and wearing a metal leash at an outdoor restaurant as she begs her 'owner' for table food</p>

<p>Cashing in: Jenna initially started her OnlyFans account as a hobby and was doing 'vanilla' stuff, but she decided to turn her passion for puppy play into a money-making opportunity</p>

<p>Money maker: Most of her earnings come from custom videos, with one person paying her a whopping $1,200 for an exclusive clip</p>

<p>Prices: 'If somebody tells me what they want, I will give them a quote. The more kinky you want, the more it will cost,' Jenna explained</p>

<p>While she has always been drawn to puppy play, it wasn't until two men in Chicago introduced her to the subculture that she really started exploring it.   </p>

<p>Jenna explained that she initially started her OnlyFans account as a hobby and was doing 'vanilla' stuff, but then she decided to turn her passion for puppy play into a money-making opportunity.  </p>

<p>'I thought, "Screw it, why don't I create the market?" I know there's a demand for it so why don't I supply it?' she said. 'It's now my full-time job. My revenue has increased 100 times since I moved to puppy play content. I'm making six figures monthly.'</p>

<p>She charges $20 per month for a subscription to her OnlyFans content, which features footage of her engaging in puppy play, often while naked. However, most of her earnings come from custom videos, with one person paying her a whopping $1,200 for an exclusive clip.   </p>

<p>'If somebody tells me what they want, I will give them a quote. The more kinky you want, the more it will cost,' she explained. </p>

<p>Invested: 'Puppygirl' Dani and her 'owner' Jack, as they're known on Instagram, see puppy play as a form of intimacy in their relationship</p>

<p>Side hustle: They both hold down regular day-jobs and make sexy puppy play videos on the side that bring them in an extra $400 a month</p>

<p>My first reel is one of my favorite tiktoks  just a cute lil puppy</p>

<p>A post shared by  Puppygirl Dani and Jack (@realjackanddani) on Aug 12, 2020 at 1:50pm PDT</p>

<p>While she considers herself fairly open and non-judgmental, she admitted that some of the requests she gets are 'a bit too much' — and she has no problem saying no to something she doesn't agree to.   </p>

<p>'People have asked me to film with a real dog and I can't say no quickly enough. There are no animals involved in my filming and never will be,' she stressed.  </p>

<p>Jenna's rising popularity online has spawned a number of reaction videos mocking her content, but she insisted that she doesn't mind being labeled as 'weird.'   </p>

<p>'I absolutely love those videos. They’re so funny,” she told Vice, admitting that the whole thing is 'super weird.'  </p>

<p>'It’s usually a big joke. I can tell if it’s mean-spirited or not — and that’s OK too,' she said. 'I’m OK with not everyone understanding it.' </p>

<p>While Jenna is a one-woman dog show with an 'owner' behind the scenes, there are also heterosexual couples diving into the world. </p>

<p>Rules: Dani puts on her collar to signify that she is ready for puppy play, and she will park to communicate with Jack. When the collar is off, she is her 'regular self' </p>

<p>Behind the scenes: Though their puppy play appears sexual online, Dani said it is mostly 'intimate' and 'affectionate' </p>

<p>In the case of 'Puppygirl' Dani and her 'owner' Jack, as they're known on Instagram, puppy play has become a form of intimacy in their relationship. </p>

<p>Like Jenna, Dani will wear a collar, play with dog toys, and eat treats that Jack gives her as her dutiful dog owner. Dani puts on her collar to signify that she is ready for puppy play, and once they get started, she will no longer talk. </p>

<p>'During play, we use barks and whines as a way of communicating,' she told Vice. 'Jack will ask a yes or no question and then tell me to bark once for no, twice for yes. It helps to keep us immersed in the scene while also providing check-in.'</p>

<p>Dani and Jack are careful to tone down their puppy play in public as to avoid accidentally involving anyone without their consent. </p>

<p>They both hold down regular day-jobs and make sexy puppy play videos on the side that bring them in an extra $400 a month. But when Dani's collar is off, it is a sign to Jack that she is her 'regular self.' </p>

<p>'It’s mostly non-sexual in our day-to-day lives,' she said. 'It appears strictly sexual online because that's how we choose to present it, but for us, it's pretty much just intimate and affectionate. It's almost childish and just fun by myself and definitely more intimate with my partner.' </p>
