        <p>The Kardashian family have denied reports that Kris Jenner decided to pull the plug on the show after three of her daughters threatened to quit.</p>

<p>It was suggested that the mother-of-six, 64, apparently called time on the show after 14 years when Kim Kardashian, 39, Kourtney Kardashian, 41, and Kylie Jenner, 23, all expressed their desire to end the programme.</p>

<p>However MailOnline now understands that it was a decision made by the whole family, not just one person and it was just as 'emotional' for everyone.</p>

<p>Denied! The Kardashian family have denied reports that Kris Jenner decided to pull the plug on the show after three of her daughters threatened to quit</p>

<p>The family have apparently been 'locked in an ongoing debate' over the future of the show for 'months', before announcing on Tuesday that they would no longer be filming the hit production.</p>

<p>Discussing the decision to end the show with executive producer Ryan Seacrest on Wednesday, Kris said: 'I think the number 20 used to sound good until 2020, but the number 20 just seemed like the right time I think for us to take a minute and breathe and everybody slow down a bit… figure out what our next steps are.</p>

<p>'We've had such an amazing run and we're so grateful … for every single moment and everyone we work with.' </p>

<p>Claims: It was suggested that the mother-of-six, 64, apparently called time on the show after 14 years when Kim Kardashian , 39, Kourtney Kardashian , 41, and Kylie Jenner, 23, all expressed their desire to end the programme </p>

<p>The denial comes following the Sun's claims that the three sisters had made it clear they no longer wanted to appear on the show.</p>

<p>An insider told the publication: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'</p>

<p>Discussing Kylie's departure, they added: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.' </p>

<p>They also noted that she is free to tour with her daughter Stormi's father Travis Scott.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kourtney had already taken a step back from the show and decided to become a secondary character during the most recent season to focus on raising her three children Mason, 10, eight, and Reign, five.</p>

<p>Kourtney previously said she felt the show had become a 'toxic environment' and was consuming to much of her day-to-day life. The insider claimed she is 'glad' the show has finally come to an end.</p>

<p>Discussing Kylie's departure, they added: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight'</p>

<p>A different source told the Sun however that the decision was not made by one person and was decided following a discussion between the whole family.  </p>

<p>On Tuesday, Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show would be ending after 14 years on the air.</p>

<p>The announcement was an open love letter to the devout fan following they have accumulated over their years on the air, but it did not explicitly state a reason for pulling the plug on the series. </p>

<p>Debate: The family have apparently been 'locked in an ongoing debate' over the future of the show for 'months', before announcing on Tuesday that they would no longer be filming the hit production</p>

<p>While viewership has dwindled and the cast members' pay-cheques have only increased, it has long been questioned when the reality show would air its final season. </p>

<p>Sources close to the situation claimed to TMZ that the Kardashian-Jenner family decided to step away from the show because their 'brand [gets] way more play on social media outlets and through their personal businesses than on TV.'</p>

<p>According to the sources, the Kardashians initially used their television series, which premiered in 2007, as a means of marketing themselves and the plethora of products they have put out over the years.</p>

<p>Together: A different source told the Sun however that the decision was not made by one person and was decided following a discussion between the whole family</p>

<p>But with the growth of social media and streaming platforms threatening the fate of cable, motivation to maintain the series diminished.</p>

<p>A source explained: 'Social media has largely replaced what 'Keeping Up' once provided.'</p>

<p>It is no secret that viewership has dropped in recent years and less than 900,000 live viewers on average tuned into the 18th and most recent series of the programme.</p>

<p>With the Kardashian family now arguably bigger than the show, it can also be called into question whether it is justifiable to keep paying them millions of pounds per season to keep the show going.</p>

<p>It was previously reported by TMZ that the family received a $150million pay day in 2017 when they signed on for a five season deal, meaning they are paid $30million per episode.</p>

<p>The family have also been hit by personal struggles as Kim's husband Kanye, 43, suffered a very public breakdown and Kim reportedly refused to reference Kanye's episode on the show.</p>

<p>Not happy: However a source told the Sun that Khloe Kardashian, 36, and Scott Disick, 37, are believed to be 'devastated' the reality show is coming off air early next year after 20 seasons</p>

<p>Kim's concern for her family life may well be behind the decision to call it quits on the show, as the majority of scenes are now based around Kim and her sister Khloe. </p>

<p>Kourtney also featured heavily on the show before she decided to take a step back to focus on motherhood last series, which sparked a physical fight between herself and Kim.</p>

<p>The brawl was widely-panned by fans who said that they were portraying negative behaviour on their programme, which may also have been a consideration when pulling the plug on the show.</p>

<p>Sisters: Kourtney previously said she felt the show had become a 'toxic environment' and was consuming to much of her day-to-day life</p>

<p>Discussing their decision to end the show, Kim wrote in her statement: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  </p>

<p>'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.'</p>

<p>'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she added. </p>

<p>Statement: On Tuesday, Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show would be ending after 14 years on the air</p>

<p>'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.</p>

<p>'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.</p>

<p>'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.' </p>

<p>Goodbye! A joint statement from the family expressed their gratitude to their fans</p>

<p> Kim Kardashian announced that her family's signature show Keeping Up With the Kardashians will come to an end next year after 20 seasons.  </p>

<p>Season 19 is set to air later this year and the final 20th season will air in early 2021, according to Kim's Tuesday announcement on Instagram. </p>

<p>The hit E! show has already aired 266 episodes and five specials, and has spawned 12 spin-off series, and has provided fans with countless moments of drama, wild fun and private moments with the famous family.  </p>

<p>A look back: Keeping Up With The Kardashian will end next year after 20 seasons, a look back at their memorable moments</p>

<p>From births to divorces and break-ups, the Kardashian-Jenner clan has exposed their lives on the show for nearly 14 years.  </p>

<p>As fans prepare to say goodbye to the show take a look back at the most memorable moments from Keeping Up With the Kardashians. </p>

<ol start="20">
<li>Kim losing her diamond earring in the French Polynesian (season six)</li>
</ol>

<p>Not so much fun: In season 6, during a family trip to Bora Bora Kim's soon-to-be husband Kris Humphries threw her into the water which caused her to lose a $75k diamond earring </p>

<p>Laughing now: Her big sister Kourtney had perhaps the funniest and most-memed response to Kim's hysterics saying 'Kim, there's people that are dying'  </p>

<p>While on a family trip to Bora Bora, Kim's soon-to-be husband Kris Humphries threw her into the water, only for her to emerge with one $75k diamond earring missing. </p>

<p>In the moment, the star was distressed and crying over the loss as Kris and Kylie stayed in the water to look. </p>

<p>Her big sister Kourtney had perhaps the funniest and most-memed response to Kim's hysterics saying 'Kim, there's people that are dying.' </p>

<li>Tristan Thompson's first cheating scandal right before Khloe gave birth (season 15)</li>
