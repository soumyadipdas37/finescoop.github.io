        <p>Cake Boss star Buddy Valastro saw his right hand get severely injured last week when he tried to fix the bowling pinsetter inside his bowling alley at his New Jersey home.</p>

<p>The TV star gave more details on his injury and his 'long road to recovery' as he revealed he has 'major tendon, nerve and muscle damage' during a TMZ Live on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old TV vet called it 'the worst pain I ever experienced in my life' as he said the metal rod, which was 3 x 2 inches, went through his right and middle finger of his right hand and it kept going in and out until his sons and brother-in-law got him out of the machine. </p>

<p>The latest: Cake Boss star Buddy Valastro saw his right hand get severely injured last week when he tried to fix the bowling pinsetter inside his bowling alley at his New Jersey home. The TV star gave more details on his injury and his 'long road to recovery' as he revealed he has 'major tendon, nerve and muscle damage' during a TMZ Live on Tuesday; pictured November 11, 2019 in Universal City</p>

<p>He noted that 'the doctor said 'its going to be a long road to recovery. We're not a 100% sure,' explaining that he 'had major tendon, nerve and muscle damage.'</p>

<p>During the interview with the outlet, the star explained exactly why the injury was so extensive: 'I had basically a metal rod that was probably three inches by two inches. It blew through my right finger and my middle finger.'</p>

<p>Adding: 'And the crazy part is, it wasn't sharp it was just a blunt, brute force right through and then once it went through, I was kind of hooked on the machine' as he explained that the rod 'was going back and forth' in his hand and shattering his thumb.</p>

<p>Buddy said he has a high tolerance of pain but 'the pain was the worst pain I ever experienced in my life. It was totally nuts.'</p>

<p>Get well soon: The 43-year-old TV vet called it 'the worst pain I ever experienced in my life' as he said the metal rod, which was 3 x 2 inches, went through his right and middle finger of his right hand and it kept going in and out until his sons and brother-in-law got him out of the machine</p>

<p>He added that he was 'so proud of my family, my sons, my brother-in-law who were there.'</p>

<p>Buddy said he somehow remained calm, and was able to direct his sons to grab tools to get him loose because he was stuck.</p>

<p>He told TMZ: 'My sons got pliers, they took a bolt out' and sawed off the machine.</p>

<p>'You appreciate doctors and what they do' when going through situations like this, noting that 'it just really shows you how much they do and how great they are. Between Morristown Hospital and HHS City - Dr. Carlson. They are miracle workers. God bless them for what they do.'</p>

<p>The TV veteran had to endure two surgeries and was in the hospital for several days as seen in Instagram photos.</p>

<p>On Monday he described the horrible incident while on the Today show as he called it a 'freak accident' that was 'crazy' before crediting his son with 'jumping into action' to free him from the machine that repeatedly cut into his hand.</p>

<p>First interview: Buddy talked to the Today show on Monday</p>

<p>He said he feels 'as good as I can.'</p>

<p>'It's just a really freak accident. You know, it was crazy just the way it went down,' said the pastry chef as he propped his bandaged hand on top of a pillow while wearing a white T-shirt and gold medallion as he sat inside his home in Montville, New Jersey.</p>

<p>'But I really am so proud of my sons and brother-in-laws who were here and really helped jump into action to set me free and help put me on the road to recovery.'</p>

<p>His has sons Buddy Jr., 16, Marco, 13, and Carlo, nine, as well as daughter Sofia, 17, with wife Lisa. </p>

<p>Buddy Jr was also present during the Today interview. </p>

<p>By his side: The star's son Buddy Jr, who helped him during the harrowing home accident, was also on the morning show </p>

<p>He said, 'I mean, he's my dad… I knew I had to do something. My aunt was going crazy, people were crying. So, he told me to grab the saw, the tools. So I ran up and got them and got him out.' </p>

<p>Buddy said he jumped on the machine to fix it, which he has done many times in the past. </p>

<p>'The machine got stuck and I went behind it to fix it, which I've done 100 times, and for one split moment I must've turned my head and then my right hand got caught between a fork and this other mechanism that goes through the fork and it kind of wedged my hand in there,' he explained.</p>

<p>'It blew through my ring finger and my middle finger as it barbed in my hand and I was stuck. It kind of crushed my thumb cause it was still moving back and forth.</p>

<p>'For some crazy reason I'm on top of this thing and got this metal rod through my hand, blood is everywhere, I don't know what kept me calm cause I was in excruciating pain.</p>

<p>Good son: He called the incident a 'freak accident' that was 'crazy' before crediting his son with 'jumping into action' to free him from the machine that repeatedly cut into his hand</p>

<p>Out of the blue: 'It's just a really freak accident. You know, it was crazy just the way it went down,' said the pastry chef</p>

<p>'Something told me to stay calm and I told my sons, "You have to get me off this machine."</p>

<p>“I couldn't be prouder of my two sons - they jumped into action - and within five minutes they had to undo a bolt, saw off one piece of metal, and then I was in my driveway. We jumped into my brother in law's car and drove down to Morristown Hospital.'</p>

<p> Valastro also thanked first responders and doctors, saying, 'when push really comes to shove, you see what a miracle worker they are.' </p>

<p>Family first: 'But I really am so proud of my sons and brother-in-laws who were here and really helped jump into action to set me free and help put me on the road to recovery,' he said</p>

<p>'I hope to make a full recovery. I'm praying, we've got a lot of prayers,' he said. 'Moments like this actually do other things for you because I've always appreciated doctors and first responders and people who take care of us but when you wind up in a situation like this and they just took care of me and nursed me back to where I am. I am so forever grateful I want to kiss their hands and just thank them for doing what they did.' </p>

<p>Buddy then started crying when he said he was so proud of his son and expressed he felt bad that his son had to experience the accident. He then thanked his child.</p>

<p>He will be spending the next few months in recovery as he tries to regain use of his hand.</p>

<p>The injury, which he has described as 'terrible,' happened over a week ago when he was bowling with his wife Lisa and their kids at his home in New Jersey.</p>

<p>His son was a hero: He said, 'I mean, he's my dad… I knew I had to do something. So, he told me to grab the saw, the tools. So I ran up and got them and got him out'</p>

<p>Buddy shared the news on Facebook when he uploaded a photo of himself in a hospital bed with his arm propped up.</p>

<p>'I was involved in a terrible accident a few days ago,' he wrote in the caption. 'What do you think of my new accessory?' he joked about his cast.   </p>

<p>'Hey guys, Buddy here, I had a really bad accident the other day at my house with my hand ... thank you for all your love and support, we're going to get through this together,' he added on Instagram.</p>

<p>He was released from the hospital last Wednesday and is recovering at home.  </p>

<p>Sweet things: Valastro is best known as the star of the reality television series Cake Boss, which premiered in April 2009</p>

<p>Gruesome: His rep told People how the accident took place. 'There was a malfunction with the bowling pinsetter, a common fix in the past, but turned into a terrible accident,' the rep said. 'After trying to release the bowling pin from the cage mechanism, his right hand became lodged and compressed inside the unit,' they continued; seen in 2019</p>

<p>His rep told People how the accident took place. 'There was a malfunction with the bowling pinsetter, a common fix in the past, but turned into a terrible accident,' the rep said.</p>

<p>'After trying to release the bowling pin from the cage mechanism, his right hand became lodged and compressed inside the unit,' they continued.</p>

<p>'Unable to remove his hand, he can see a 1-1/2' metal rod slowly and repeatedly impale his hand three times between his ring finger and middle finger.'</p>

<p>He endured five minutes of the same move, crushing his hand.</p>

<p>His cute kids: His has sons Buddy Jr., 16, Marco, 13, and Carlo, nine, as well as daughter Sofia, 17 with the family dogs</p>

<p>His sons Buddy Jr and Marco sprung into action by using a reciprocating saw 'to cut through the metal rod and relieve his father from the machine,' according to the rep.</p>

<p>He was rushed to Morristown Memorial in New Jersey for his first surgery then Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan for his second operation where orthopedic surgeon Dr Michelle Carlson worked on him. </p>

<p>'It will be an uphill battle as it's Buddy's dominant right hand and he will need prolonged recovery and therapy,' Valastro's rep added.  </p>

<p>Valastro is best known as the star of the reality television series Cake Boss, which premiered in April 2009. </p>

<p>She was by his side: His wife Lisa Valastro helped him after the accident; seen at the 2019 E! People's Choice Awards in November 2019 in Santa Monica, California</p>
