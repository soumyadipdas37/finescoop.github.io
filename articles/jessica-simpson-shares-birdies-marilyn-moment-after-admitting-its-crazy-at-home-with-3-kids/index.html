        <p>Jessica Simpson poked fun of a sweet photo of her youngest child, daughter Birdie. </p>

<p>The 40-year-old entrepreneur pointed out that her little girl was having a 'Marilyn Moment' as she stood over an air vent at home.</p>

<p>Birdie, one, rocked an adorable red-and-white gingham dress with white shoes for the snap shared to her mother's millions of followers.  </p>

<p>Just for fun: Jessica Simpson pointed out that her little girl was having a 'Marilyn Moment' as she stood over an air vent at home</p>

<p>Best in show: Marilyn's classic dress incident in the classic '55 film The Seven Year Itch catapulted her to stardom</p>

<p>Marilyn's classic dress incident in the classic '55 film The Seven Year Itch catapulted her to stardom.</p>

<p>Last week, Jessica plugged her fall fashion collection with her mother Tina on the Home Shopping Network.</p>

<p>And during the two-hour show, Simpson touched on how things are going at home with her three kids during lockdown.</p>

<p>On the air! Jessica Simpson plugged her fall fashion collection with her mother Tina on the Home Shopping Network; here she is seen with her dog</p>

<p>Ready to sell: The 40-year-old singer and actress was bubbly and unfiltered as she wore a low-cut leopard print dress from her collection. Here mother is seen left in the showroom</p>

<p>The star said it has been 'crazy' with three children inside her Calabasas, California mansion she shares with her husband Eric Johnson.</p>

<p>But the Dukes Of Hazzard actress relayed to her fans they are 'dealing with it' just fine, but it's been 'tough' getting used to Zoom. </p>

<p>They have daughter Maxwell, aged eight, son Ace, aged seven, and daughter, Birdie Mae, aged one. </p>

<p>'We're trying our best,' admitted the blonde. 'It can be overwhelming, there is so much going on.' </p>

<p>So much fun together: Here the mother and daughter try on the fuzzy fall jackets Jessica has designed for her collection</p>

<p>Trying her best: During the two hour show the 40-year-old touched on how things are going at home with her three kids during lockdown</p>

<p>Coping skills: The star said it has been 'crazy' with three children inside her Calabasas, California mansion she shares with her husband Eric Johnson. But the Dukes Of Hazzard actress relayed to her fans they are 'dealing with it' just fine</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She also said her kids are 'coping way better than I would ever expect.'</p>

<p>'Eric does the math part because that's not my specialty and I'm better with the English part,' she added.</p>

<p>The siren also sold her tell-all memoir Open Book on HSN, which she said will leave people with 'no questions' about her because she covered every topic in her life. </p>

<p>And Simpson also said that she is most proud of being sober for three years. 'It is the best thing I have ever done in my life, I am very proud of it.'</p>

<p>In the past she has said a history of sexual abuse contributed to an alcohol and stimulant addiction. </p>

<p>Happy to be sober: The siren also sold on HSN her tell-all memoir Open Book, which she said will leave people with 'no questions' about her because she covered every topic in her life. And Simpson also said that she is most proud of being sober for three years. 'It is the best thing I have ever done in my life, I am very proud of it'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>CEO Jessica and her mother Tina, who is the president of Jessica Simpson Collection, were being filmed from their showroom in Los Angeles that they said is not far from Jessica's Calabasas, California home.</p>

<p>Simpson seemed game to plug her wares as she tried on several different pairs of shoes and recommended what certain things should be paired with.</p>

<p>Her figure looked sensational in the dress after losing 100lbs in 2019 after welcoming her third child.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday the former pop singer showed off her toned shape as she sat in a chair with a sleeveless white leotard on and a pair of wild-looking boots. </p>

<p>Perfect shape: Simpson's figure looks better than ever after losing 100lbs in 2019 after welcoming her third child. And on Thursday the former pop singer showed off her toned shape as she sat in a chair with a sleeveless white leotard on</p>

<p>'Tune in to @HSN tonight while my business boss/mom, @TinaSimpsonOfficial, and I go live from our @JessicaSimpsonStyle LA Showroom at 7-9pm EST/ 4-6pm PST,' she stated.</p>

<p>'We will be sharing some of our favorite new Fall styles including the first pair of flat boots that I have fallen in love with since high school.'</p>

<p>The star was on a small green velvet chair inside her walk-in closet.</p>

<p>Her blonde hair was worn down with a black hat on top as she had on a white top while looking to the side.</p>

<p>Her look is loved: She has been dutifully showing off her designs all month as she ramps up for fall sales. Last week she showed off these Daisy Duke shorts with a crop top and heels</p>

<p>The Public Affair hitmaker was showing off her new shoes, which she said were the first flat boots she has loved since high school. </p>

<p>She has been dutifully showing off her designs all month as she ramps up for fall sales.</p>

<p>The star had on one of her tops as she was hugged by her husband Eric Johnson to celebrate his 41st birthday.</p>

<p>The successful designer who makes clothes, purses, sunglasses and shoes, among other things, had on skintight jeans and a hoodie.</p>

<p>'Oh how I love you!!! When I was in my mommy’s belly God formed me and placed you in my heart,' Jessica began her caption.</p>

<p>Look by Jess: She has been dutifully showing off her designs all month as she ramps up for fall sales. The star had on one of her tops as she was hugged by her husband Eric Johnson to celebrate his 41st birthday </p>

<p>The TV star took up with Eric in 2010 and married him in 2014, welcoming three children with him - Maxwell, eight, Ace, seven, and Birdie, one.</p>

<p>'It took me 29yrs to discover my soulmate and colliding with your heart was our spiritual destiny,' she wrote of the former NFL star.</p>

<p>'You are the human that all should aspire to be. A force of transformative inspiration to all that know and love you and are lucky enough to have you love them back.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I am so excited to see all that you have been working on so beautifully to be introduced into the world this year!'</p>

<p>Her second daughter: On the star's hip was her latest edition, daughter Birdie Mae</p>

<p>Jessica soldiered ahead with a plug for her husband's new brand Legendary Disciplines, which made the hoodie she was wearing in the Instagram picture.</p>

<p>Eric joined Instagram just to start an account for the brand and Jessica swung by Insta Stories to welcome 'the most social guy I know' to the platform. </p>

<p>'Everyone get ready to be enlightened by my legendary spiritual guru... @legendarydisciplines,' she wrote. 'Thank God ERIC JOHNSON was born this day 41yrs ago! Happy Birthday hubba hubba hubby of mine!!!'</p>

<p>Before Jessica married Eric, whose football position was tight end, she spent 2002 until 2006 married to her fellow singer Nick Lachey.</p>

<p>Nick has gone on to marry Vanessa Minnillo, whom he was infamously pap-snapped getting intimate with in a hot tub in Mexico while they were dating.</p>

<p>Jessica's younger sister and fellow pop act Ashlee Simpson is currently expecting her own third child, her second by her current husband Evan Ross.</p>

<p>Like his wife Evan comes from a showbiz family - his mother is legendary singer Diana Ross and his sister is actress Tracee Ellis Ross.</p>
