    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Ivana Trump was dressed to impress in a red pantsuit as she picked up some food — likely a hot dog or sausage —  from her favorite New York City food cart while out for a neighborhood stroll with her dog. </p>

<p>The 71-year-old Czech-born businesswoman was seen buying some street meat near her Manhattan townhouse on Monday, the day after The New York Times released a bombshell report about the tax returns filed by ex-husband her President Donald Trump, which also implicated their daughter Ivanka.  </p>

<p>Ivana, who recently faced backlash for her controversial comments about immigration, hasn't let any of the drama keep her from enjoying the fall weather or her favorite foods. </p>

<p>Out and about: Ivana Trump, 71, was seen enjoying a stroll through her neighborhood with her teacup Yorkshire terrier, Tiger, who is also a certified comfort dog  </p>

<p>She's a regular! Ivana stopped by her favorite street vendor to pick up some street meat. The socialite regularly eats hot dogs and sausages from a food cart at 64th and Madison</p>

<p>The former model donned a red collarless jacket with gold zipper details and a matching pair of dress pants while out for a walk with her teacup Yorkshire terrier, Tiger, who is also a certified comfort dog.</p>

<p>Ivana wore comfortable shoes, opting for a pair of classic red flats. She accessorized her look with gold bauble earrings and her beloved Lady Dior mini bag.</p>

<p>She also sported a black fabric face mask, but she had it pulled down below her nose, essentially defeating the purpose of wearing it. </p>

<p>Her platinum blonde hair was teased at the top and pulled back into a ponytail, with her bangs framing her perfectly made-up face. </p>

<p>She sported thick black liner around her eyes and rosy-pink lipstick, her preferred beauty look in recent years. </p>

<p>Ivana was seen waiting in line at the street vendor, and she kept her eyes on the food that was being prepared in front of her. </p>

<p>Waiting game: Ivana was dressed to impress in a red pantsuit and gold earrings. She also wore a black face mask, but it was pulled down below her nose, defeating the purpose </p>

<p>She paid with cash before returning to her home with her meal, which was placed in a brown paper bag. </p>

<p>This isn't the first time she has visited the good cart, and it likely won't be her last. The Manhattan socialite's love of street vendor hot dogs is actually well documented by her neighbors. </p>

<p>In April 2018, Page Six reported that Ivana had a 'secret street meat habit' and regularly eats at a food cart at 64th and Madison, which has been there for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>'I see her all the time. It’s her favorite restaurant,' one source told the outlet. </p>

<p>Ivana opts for a hot dog or a sausage during her visits, according to local sources.</p>

<p>The mother-of-three previously spoke about her love of hot dogs while promoting Gianluca Mech's Italiano Diet, which involves eating low-calorie packaged meals, including $20 cookies, $24 crunchy bars with berries, and $14 pasta.</p>

<p>On the go: She paid with cash before returning to her home with her meal, which was placed in a brown paper bag</p>

<p>Former model: Ivana's platinum blonde hair was teased at the top and pulled back into a ponytail, with her bangs framing her perfectly made-up face</p>

<p>'I was always very disciplined — I didn’t gain weight my whole life,' she told the New York Post, but she noted she does occasionally splurge on her favorite foods.</p>

<p>'There’s a street vendor on my block and I get a hot dog once a month — no bread,' she said. 'It’s New York — live and let live.'</p>

<p>Ivana also admitted that she loves Kentucky Fried Chicken.</p>

<p>'I dream of it,' she said. 'I have it once a year, and I’ll have it and won’t eat anything for two days.'</p>

<p>Monday's trip to the food cart was only unusual for Ivana in the sense that she was out and about the day after The New York Times published its report about her ex-husband's tax returns. </p>

<p>Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, after years of reporting heavy losses from his business enterprises to offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income, the Times reported, citing tax-return data.</p>

<p>His tax records show he is carrying a total of $421 million in loans and debt with a number of his properties said to be struggling financially. </p>

<p>Timing: Ivana stepped out the day after The New York Times published a report about her ex President Donald Trump only paying $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017 </p>

<p>Opinion: Ivana met Trump at a modeling event in New York City in 1976, and they married in April 1977. They are pictured in 1989. They divorced a year later in 1990</p>

<p>In the report, dismissed by President Trump as 'fake news,' the newspaper claimed that most of that debt comes from the Doral golf resort in Florida — $125 million — and Trump's Washington hotel — $160 million. On top of that, a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower in New York will come due in 2022.</p>

<p>The Republican found multiple ways to reduce his tax bills, taking tax deductions on personal expenses such as housing, aircraft, and $70,000 to style his hair while he filmed 'The Apprentice.' A nearly $100,000 payment to his eldest daughter Ivanka's favorite hair and makeup stylist was also listed as a business expense.</p>

<p>The report also suggests hundreds of thousands of dollars of 'consulting fees' were given to the Ivanka, and they appear to have helped lower the family's tax bill. </p>

<p>The tax records show that Trump was able to partly reduce his tax bills between 2010 and 2018 by writing off about $26 million in consulting fees.</p>

<p>A payment of $747,622 to an unnamed Trump Organization consultant is the exact amount Ivanka declared in her own public disclosure filings when she joined the White House as an adviser in 2017.</p>

<p>She listed that payment as one from a consulting firm she co-owns. </p>

<p>A lawyer for the Trump Organization would not comment when asked about the consulting payments to Ivanka.</p>

<p>Implicated: The report suggests $747,622 in 'consulting fees' were given to their daughter Ivanka while she was at the Trump Organization, which appears to have lowered his tax bill</p>

<p>Defensive: President Trump has been on the defense since the damning disclosure, and he took to Twitter on Monday to accuse the Times of 'illegally' obtaining his tax information  </p>

<p>President Trump has been on the defense since the damning disclosure, and he attacked the Times in a news conference on Sunday evening. </p>

<p>The next day, he sent out a series of tweets accusing the newspaper of 'illegally' obtaining his tax information, arguing he paid 'millions' in taxes and was 'entitled' to the credits he received.</p>

<p>'The Fake News Media, just like Election time 2016, is bringing up my Taxes &amp; all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information &amp; only bad intent. I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation &amp; tax credits,' Trump wrote. </p>

<p>'Also, if you look at the extraordinary assets owned by me, which the Fake News hasn’t, I am extremely under leveraged - I have very little debt compared to the value of assets,' Trump added. </p>

<p>He said he 'may' release additional financial statements to show his financial holdings.</p>

<p>'Much of this information is already on file, but I have long said that I may release Financial Statements, from the time I announced I was going to run for President, showing all properties, assets and debts. It is a very IMPRESSIVE Statement, and also shows that I am the only President on record to give up my yearly $400,000 plus Presidential Salary!' he tweeted. </p>

<p>Ivana has had her own controversies to deal after appearing on the British talk show Loose Women earlier this month. </p>

<p>She. has her own drama: Ivana was branded a 'bigot' after her rant against immigrants on the British talk show Loose Women a few weeks ago </p>

<p>During the show, she generalized to the hosts that undocumented immigrants may rape women or no dress 'Americanly.'   </p>

<p>'I am an immigrant, and I have no problem with the immigrants, but they must come into the country legally and get a job and pay taxes like the rest of the Americans and just live and be part of society,' said Czech-born Ivana, who is a legal immigrant to the U.S. </p>

<p>'There are some people who don't even dress Americanly, they dress whatever they dress in and they don't get a job and they steal and they rape the women and that is not the idea.'</p>

<p>Her comments left viewers outraged, with one calling the outburst 'disturbing,' while another called her an 'embarrassing bigot.'</p>

<p>Ivana grew up in Czechoslovakia and moved to Canada in September 1973. She met Trump at a modeling event in New York City in 1976, and they married in April 1977.</p>

<p>The couple's first son, Donald Jr., was born later that year in December. They welcomed their daughter Ivanka in 1981 and then their son Eric in 1984.</p>

<p>All three of the children were born in New York, making them US citizens. Ivana was legally living in the country at the time, but she didn't become a US citizen until 1988, although she was eligible for naturalization and citizenship three years after tying the knot with Trump. They divorced in 1990.</p>
