<p>He kept the dark grey look going with a checked baker boy cap and white facemask as he strolled arm in arm with his new ladylove.</p>

<p>Just the day before the happy couple once again strolled with their hands interlocked as they made their way through Downtown's famous Wall Street area.</p>

<p>Hand-in-hand: At one point, the 41-year-old actress and the 33-year-old chef strolled with their hands interlocked as they made their way through Downtown's famous Wall Street area</p>

<p>The Dawson's Creek star looked noticeably fresh faced, although she kept her mouth and nose concealed behind a medical grade face mask. </p>

<p>She let her lengthy brunette hair rock its natural wave, which created an overall voluminous look for the actress.</p>

<p>Vitolo, whose family runs and owns the famous restaurant Emilio's Ballato in NYC, looked undeniably suave with his perfectly slicked hair and stylish peacoat.</p>

<p>He also had on blue v-neck t-shirt and some dark wash denim jeans, which created a stylish, yet casual silhouette. </p>

<p>Following in Katie's footsteps, Emilio made sure to wear a face mask for their romantic outing.</p>

<p>His mask often slipped off his nose as he spoke to Katie and during one pit stop, Vitolo completely removed his mask from his face. </p>

<p>He graciously carted Holmes around the city in his bright red Pontiac, even briefly swinging by her Soho apartment. </p>

<p>Masking it up: Following in Katie's footsteps, Emilio made sure to wear a face mask for their romantic outing</p>

<p>Katie and Emilio were first linked on Tuesday, September 1, while on an apparent date at Mediterranean restaurant Antique Garage in Soho.</p>

<p>But the romantic nature of their relationship was unveiled on Sunday, September 6, as they indulged in a hot and heavy make out session at Peasant Restaurant in Manhattan</p>

<p>The actress joyously sat on the chef's lap as they locked lips and erupted in frequent fits of laughter. </p>

<p>Katie has been uncharacteristically public regarding her budding relationship with Emilio Jr. as she often seen hanging out with him at his father's popular restaurant Emilio's Ballato in Manhattan. </p>

<p>A source close to the situation recently dished to People that Katie is beyond 'smitten' with her toyboy and that she 'keeps texting him all day long and he loves it.'</p>

<p>The source added: 'He can't get enough of her attention.'</p>

<p>DailyMail.com confirmed exclusively on September 10 that Vitolo broke up with his live-in fiancée Rachel Emmons, 24, via text message when the photos of him locking lips with Katie went public.</p>

<p>Smitten: A source close to the situation recently dished to People that Katie is beyond 'smitten' with her toyboy and that she 'keeps texting him all day long and he loves it'; Emilio and Katie pictured on September 18</p>

<p>The bombshell break up forced the 24-year-old handbag designer to grapple with the end of an engagement amid COVID-19 and move back to her parents' home. </p>

<p>It was also uncovered that Katie and Emilio's friendship has been growing since October 2019, and that the actress appears unbothered by the chef's engagement drama.</p>

<p>Katie and Emilio first met when a mutual friend introduced them, and their passions have only intensified since she returned home to New York City following time quarantining with her family in Ohio. </p>

<p>An insider close to the Logan Lucky star said she's now behaving 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something [her ex-boyfriend] Jamie [Foxx] couldn't,' the source added.</p>

<p>Recovering: An insider close to the Logan Lucky star said she's now behaving 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something [her ex-boyfriend] Jamie [Foxx] couldn't,' the source added; Jamie and Katie pictured in 2019</p>

<p>The insider said Holmes had been devastated by her breakup last year with the playboy actor, who never seemed to give up his roving eye and was still too close for comfort with his baby mama.</p>

<p>The acting couple were first linked in 2013 hand-in-hand through Malibu, but they kept their relationship private throughout the years, but split after going public last year at the Met Gala.</p>

<p>Holmes was famously married to Tom Cruise, 58, from 2006 until their dramatic divorce in 2012, and they share daughter Suri, 14, born in 2006.</p>
