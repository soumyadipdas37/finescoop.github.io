        <p>The family of a teenager (pictured) involved in a horror stabbing attack at Pyrmont in July have offered up $700,000 surety to secure their son bail</p>

<p>The family of a teenager allegedly involved in a horror Pyrmont knife attack that left a father-of-one blinded have offered up a whopping $700,000 to secure his release.</p>

<p>Brett Halcro, 36, was walking through a park in Pyrmont, in inner-city Sydney, on July 31 when a group of up to nine teens allegedly attacked him, before one pulled a knife and 'sliced' him across the face up to seven times. </p>

<p>That teen then allegedly drove the blade 'deep' into Mr Halcro's right eye. </p>

<p>One in the group who allegedly initiated the attack and stomped on Mr Halcro's head has since been granted bail, it was revealed in court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The teenager - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - will face strict conditions, including having to live with his parents, who put up $700,000 as a surety.</p>

<p>If he breaches any of his conditions they will forfeit some or all of the money. </p>

<p>Father-of-one Brett Halcro, 36, pictured before the attack that left him blinded in one eye and in a coma for more than a week. He was allegedly knocked from his bike, stomped on and then 'sliced' across the face, before the knife was driven 'deep' into his right eye</p>

<p>A picture taken in Mr Halcro's hospital ward at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where he was in a coma for one week, his family said</p>

<p>Police have so far arrested nine youths over the attack, with six of them appearing in the Surry Hills Children's Court on Tuesday. CCTV, DNA and mobile phone evidence will make up part of the prosecution case against them, the court heard </p>

<p>The teenager's lawyer said he hoped the teenager would be released 'this week'.</p>

<p>That is despite a police prosecutor describing the allegations against the teenager as 'involving violence at the highest order'.</p>

<p>'I don’t think I have read anything like this ever that goes towards the strength of the prosecution case,' NSW Police prosecutor Peter Mort said in July, on the teen's first day in court.</p>

<p>'I don’t need to amplify what is contained (in the court documents) other than to say it is disturbing.' </p>

<p>Six of the teens involved in the alleged attack - some from Sydney's most prestigious private schools - faced Surry Hills Children's Court on Tuesday, where it was revealed CCTV and DNA evidence will be crucial in the case against the them.</p>

<p>The court also heard that further health complications suffered by Mr Halcro will lead to a further delay in the case.</p>

<p>Police prosecutor Kai Jiang said on Tuesday it would be a further eight weeks before the matters of all the teenagers could return to court.</p>

<p>He said this was due largely to 'the sheer volume of CCTV footage that will be used in evidence'.</p>

<p>The alleged attackers and some friends - many of them students at some of Sydney's most prestigious private schools - had rented an Airbnb in the city for the night.  </p>

<p>It is understood that two girls who were among the group spotted Mr Halcro riding a bike below them and told friends they had been 'raped' or 'groped' by him.</p>

<p>Pictured: One of the teens who allegedly took part in the attack. None of the youths can be named for legal reasons</p>

<p>When the alleged offenders faced Surry Hills Children's Court in July, police prosecutor Peter Mort calling it a 'sickening' attack and 'violence of the highest order'</p>

<p>A teen member of the gang allegedly sent these gloating, sadistic messages after the attack</p>

<p>The court heard that in the moments before the attack, one of the girls was asked: 'Is that the one who raped you?' to which she replied: 'Yeah that's the one'.</p>

<p>But NSW Police have said in court documents that the man was an 'innocent victim'.</p>

<p>Moments later the group of teenagers allegedly rushed downstairs and attacked Mr Halcro, knocking him to the ground before bashing and stomping him.</p>

<p>He was then left for dead in a park on the corner of Pyrmont Bridge Road and Wattle Streets. </p>

<p>Among the most crucial evidence to be used in the case against the group will be text messages sent by a 15-year-old to a friend after the attack in which he detailed the alleged assault of their victim.</p>

<p>The young man allegedly claimed watching the attack unfold made him laugh. </p>

<p>'I stomped on him and gutted his head he got knocked out after I bottled him on the head,' the youngster allegedly wrote in one text message.</p>

<p>'I put the shattered bottle in his stomach and then jetted (a co-accused) slit his face like 15 times and stabbed him in the eye.' </p>

<p>Theresa Keecherer, Mr Halcro's former partner with whom he shares a four-year-old daughter (pictured), said she has trouble explaining to her daughter what had happened to him </p>

<p>It is understood the attack may have been sparked by two girls who were in the group claiming they had been 'raped' or 'groped' by Mr Halcro, but NSW Police have said he was an 'innocent victim'.</p>

<p>So far nine teenagers have been arrested over the attack in which Brett Halcro was allegedly knocked off his bike (pictured) before being sadistically injured while unconscious</p>

<p>Pictured: police at the scene of the attack in Sydney's Pyrmont on Friday night, July 31 </p>

<p>It is believed the alleged attacker was then asked by his friend if he knew the man.</p>

<p>'Nah mate. Ahahahaha he was in the wrong place at the wrong time,' he allegedly replied.</p>

<p>'He (a co-accused) stuck it in his eye. Put it in deeper and swivelled the knife around. So funny.'</p>

<p>Mr Halcro, a father-of-one from Melbourne's south-east, had moved to Sydney earlier this year before the border closure to help his father renovate his home. </p>

<p>He was in a coma for more than a week after the attack and has permanently lost the use of his right eye, but his family recently told how he is now back on his feet. </p>

<p>After almost three weeks in intensive care, Mr Halcro's family shared a photo of him on his feet, walking in the hospital, showing his astounding recovery.</p>

<p>'Bandages have been removed from his arms and face,' family member Luke wrote on his GoFundMe page.</p>

<p>The teenagers who faced court on Tuesday will next appear in Surry Hill's Children's Court (pictured) on November 24 </p>

<p>'His fitness and youth have led to pleasing progress, as remarked by the physiotherapists,' a relative said.</p>

<p>'Having spoken with Brett twice now (most recently this morning), I can say that his emotional wellbeing continues to fluctuate understandably, however I was incredibly proud to hear him speak with such perspective and with a relatively positive outlook on his long road ahead.</p>

<p>'He told me today that his daily highlights are visits/calls from family and also physio sessions, where he said he has a point to prove!'</p>

<p>The teenagers who faced court on Tuesday will next appear on November 24.   </p>
