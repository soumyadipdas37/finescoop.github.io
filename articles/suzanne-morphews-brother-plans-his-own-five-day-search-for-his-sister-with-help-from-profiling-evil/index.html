    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Suzanne Morphew's brother is organizing his own search for the Colorado mom who's been missing since Mother's Day as he says he suspects foul play in her disappearance. </p>

<p>Andrew Moorman held a vigil for his sister in her hometown of Alexandria, Indiana, over the weekend, where he announced his plan to recruit more than 1,000 volunteers for a five-day search. </p>

<p>'I've got to find my little sister, and I have to bring closure to my family,' Moorman said, according to the Herald Bulletin. 'We were quiet for a while because the investigators asked that of us, but it's time now to rally the troops and go west and find her.'  </p>

<p>Moorman enlisted the help of Profiling Evil, a team of criminal behavior and intelligence experts who have consulted on high-profile homicide and kidnapping investigations, in setting up his independent search. </p>

<p>Suzanne, 49, was reported missing on May 10 after she went out for a bike ride near her home in Salida, Colorado, and never returned.   </p>

<p>Her brother has expressed frustration with the investigation that has failed to find his sister four months later. </p>

<p>'It's been rough,' Moorman said during the vigil on Saturday. 'We just can't get any closure on this thing. The investigators don't let loose of very much information. They protect a lot of it for investigative purposes, and that's been rough.' </p>

<p>Andrew Moorman (left) is organizing his own search for his sister Suzanne Morphew (right), who went missing near her home in Salida, Colorado, on Mother's Day</p>

<p>Moorman held a vigil (pictured) for his sister in her hometown of Alexandria, Indiana, on Saturday, where he announced his plan to recruit 1,000 volunteers for a five-day search</p>

<p>As the case drags on, Moorman said he's increasingly convinced that foul play is involved.  </p>

<p>'Suzanne would never leave her home or her daughters, there's just no way, and she's hidden way too well,' he said. </p>

<p>'A robber doesn't do that, this is something other than that.'</p>

<p>Moorman's search is tentatively scheduled to take place between September 23 and 28. Dozens of people in the Alexandria area have already signed on to help, CBS4 reported.  </p>

<p>'We're not gonna quit looking until we find my little sister,' the brother told Chris McDonough and Mike King of Profiling Evil in an interview. </p>

<p>'If I have to put on the largest manhunt ever known to man, I'll do it.</p>

<p>'We've been quiet because we did not want to fudge up and investigation. But now, I'm telling you right now, we'll stop at nothing to find my little sister. </p>

<p>'I want to give her a proper burial or a homecoming, which ever it will be.'</p>

<p>'I've got to find my little sister, and I have to bring closure to my family,' Moorman said at the vigil. 'It's time now to rally the troops and go west and find her'</p>

<p>Moorman is seen with his sister Suzanne in an old photo. The brother says he suspects foul play in the 49-year-old's disappearance</p>

<p>Moorman spoke publicly about the case last week in an interview with Fox News, where he pleaded with Suzanne's husband, Barry Morphew, to cooperate with authorities leading the case. </p>

<p>On the day that Suzanne disappeared, Barry was reportedly 150 miles away in Broomfield, a Denver suburb, working on a landscaping job for transport company RTD-Denver.</p>

<p>He has denied any involvement in his wife's disappearance, and refutes claims that he has refused to take a polygraph test. </p>

<p>But his brother-in-law Moorman challenged that assertion in his interview on August 24 when he said Barry should do more to help with the investigation.  </p>

<p>'Please, Barry, if you could see this, I would really love it if you would take the time to revisit the authorities and go over everything once again ... Take a voice analysis and a lie detector test and clear yourself,' Moorman said.  </p>

<p>'Put my mind at ease and everybody out there's mind at ease if you want to shut the rumors down. That's the way you do it. You need to find your wife. That should be your only goal is to find your wife and whatever you're asked to do by the authorities is what you should. If you're not guilty, step up to the plate.' </p>

<p>The search for Suzanne has focused on her $1.5million home in Salida (pictured)</p>

<p>Suzanne's husband Barry (above together) has denied any involvement in her disappearance</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Barry was out of town when Suzanne vanished, the couple's home quickly became the focus of the police investigation, with CSI specialists seen carrying evidence bags into the property in photos taken by DailyMail.com two days later.  </p>

<p>Investigators searched the property again in July, and said at the time that they hadn't ruled anyone out as a suspect.  </p>

<p>Last week, Barry claimed that he'd given 30 hours of interviews to police and accused them of botching the initial investigation. </p>

<p>Jeff Puckett (pictured) told DailyMail.com that he took over Barry's Holiday Inn hotel room on May 10 and found it scattered with wet towels and stinking of chlorine</p>

<p>And on Wednesday, DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that a co-worker of Barry's took over his Holiday Inn hotel room on May 10 and found it scattered with wet towels and stinking of chlorine.</p>

<p>Jeff Puckett, 49, of Salida, said he was ordered to Denver by Barry that morning but didn't see him because he had already left 'due to a family emergency'.</p>

<p>Speaking in an exclusive interview, Puckett told DailyMail.com: 'I got there Sunday night and the room smelled like chlorine real bad.</p>

<p>'It was his room and he'd taken a shower – his towels were all over the floor.'</p>

<p>A manager at the $92-a-night property confirmed to DailyMail.com that they do not use chlorine to clean guest rooms and have handed security footage from the weekend of May 9 to police.</p>

<p>Puckett also said he discovered a pile of mail in the room – including a letter about property insurance – and later turned it over to the FBI.</p>

<p>He said: 'I found some mail in the hotel room. His mail was in there and I gave it to the FBI. I thought it was kind of odd to have it there.</p>

<p>'Some of it was from an insurance company, like insuring your property, that kind of thing.'</p>

<p>A manager at the Holiday Inn hotel (pictured) confirmed to DailyMail.com that they do not use chlorine to clean guest rooms</p>

<p>DailyMail.com can also reveal Barry was granted guardianship of Suzanne in order to sell a property in their native Indiana on Tuesday after a 30-minute Zoom hearing.</p>

<p>Despite being told the landscaping work was urgent, Puckett told DailyMail.com that he arrived to find no tools and was left to wait around the hotel for two days – never actually visiting the job site.</p>

<p>He said he returned to Salida on the Tuesday after Suzanne disappeared and has not heard from Barry since, although he was paid. </p>

<p>As a result, he says the experience has left him suspicious. 'It's kind of weird,' he told DailyMail.com. My first thought was that this must be like an alibi. That's what it felt like.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I hope they find her alive but it's been a long time.'</p>

<p>All of Puckett's information has been passed to police by DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Suzanne and her husband Barry are pictured with their daughters, Mallory and Macy, in an old social media snap </p>

<p>Barry released a video pleading for his wife's safe return one week after she went missing, saying: 'Oh Suzanne, if anyone is out there that can hear this, that has you, please, we'll do whatever it takes to bring you back.</p>

<p>'We love you. We miss you. The girls need you. No questions asked. However much they want, I will do whatever it takes to get you back. Honey, I love you. I want you back so bad.'</p>

<p>Barry then avoided media interviews for three months until finally opening up to Fox29 last week and denying any involvement in her disappearance. </p>

<p>The 52-year-old, who refused to speak on camera or be recorded, also mooted several theories about what could have happened to her, including an animal attack or a stranger abduction. </p>

<p>The investigation is led by the Chaffee County Sheriff's Office with assistance from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). </p>

<p>Authorities say they've received more than 600 tips about Suzanne's disappearance - which is still considered to be a missing persons case. </p>

<p>Anyone with information is asked to contact investigators at (719) 312-7530.  </p>
