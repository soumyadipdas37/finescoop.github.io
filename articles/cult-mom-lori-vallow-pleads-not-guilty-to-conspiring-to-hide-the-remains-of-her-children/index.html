        <p>'Cult' mom Lori Vallow has pleaded not guilty to charges related to the deaths of her children. </p>

<p>Lori, 47, entered her plea on Thursday morning in Madison County Court via a Zoom call from jail. </p>

<p>This month marked the one-year anniversary of the disappearance of Lori's children, Joshua 'JJ' Vallow and Tylee Ryan, whose bodies were found buried on her husband Chad Daybell's property in June.  </p>

<p>Investigators believe the children, who were never reported missing by their mother, were murdered within hours of when they vanished within two weeks of each other in September 2019.  </p>

<p>Both Lori and Chad are now facing two felony counts for conspiring to conceal or destroy evidence in the case. </p>

<p>'Cult' mom Lori Vallow pleaded not guilty to charges related to the deaths of her children on Thursday morning in Madison County Court via a Zoom call from jail</p>

<p>Lori is facing three additional misdemeanor counts of resisting or obstructing officers, solicitation to commit a crime and contempt of court from her arrest back in February.  </p>

<p>Chad has already pleaded not guilty to both the conspiracy charges and two other counts for destruction or concealment of evidence.</p>

<p>Both defendants are set to face trial in January 2021. </p>

<p>Madison County Special Prosecutor Rob Wood and the state of Idaho asked a judge to join the cases against Lori and Chad last week - just after Chad's attorney asked to have the case against him thrown out altogether. </p>

<p>Neither Chad nor Lori have been accused of harming Tylee and JJ. Authorities have yet to say how the children died, or whether homicide charges will be filed in the future. </p>

<p>Chad Daybell (pictured) already pleaded not guilty to two felony counts for conspiracy to conceal or destroy evidence and two felony counts for destruction or concealment of evidence</p>

<p>Tylee vanished on September 8, 2019, just days before her 17th birthday. Investigators said her body was burned and dismembered before being buried sometime the following day. </p>

<p>JJ was last seen two weeks later on September 23. His body was wrapped in duct tape and plastic and buried the same day, investigators said. </p>

<p>Authorities believe Lori's now-deceased brother Alex Cox brought the children's bodies to Chad's home to bury them. </p>

<p>The search for JJ and Tylee began back in November 2019 when police officers performed a welfare check at Lori's home in Rexburg and found that neither of the children had been heard from since two months earlier.  </p>

<p>The case captured nationwide attention with the revelations that police were also investigating at least three suspicious deaths linked to Lori and Chad, as well as relatives' claims that the couple are members of a dangerous doomsday cult.</p>

<p>Lori and Chad went on the run the day after police began searching for the children and reopened an investigation into the death of Chad's first wife Tammy Daybell, who died on October 19, 2019.  </p>

<p>Police tracked the couple down in Hawaii in January and Lori was later arrested on charges of child abandonment and desertion. </p>

<p>The search came to a devastating end in June as JJ and Tylee's remains were discovered in Chad's backyard in Salem, Idaho. </p>

<p>This is a developing story.  </p>

<p>Tylee Ryan, 16, and Joshua 'JJ' Vallow, seven, disappeared in September 2019 but were never reported missing by their mother. The children's remains were found buried on Chad's property in June</p>

<p>Investigators are seen recovering the remains of Tylee and JJ from the backyard of Chad's home in Salem, Idaho, on June 9 </p>

<p>July 11, 2019: Lori Vallow's husband, Charles Vallow, is killed by her brother, Alex Cox, in Arizona. Police initially rule that Alex acted in self defense but reopen the case months later after the children are reported missing. </p>

<p>August: Lori moves children JJ and Tylee to Rexburg, Idaho, where her future husband Chad Daybell lives with his wife Tammy.</p>

<p>September 8: The last time Tylee is seen during a trip to Yellowstone National Park with Lori, JJ and Alex. In the following weeks she tells people who ask where Tylee is that she's studying at Brigham Young University's Idaho campus.</p>

<p>September 23: The last time JJ is seen at his school in Rexburg. Lori emailed the school the following day and claims she is moving the family to California for a new job. </p>

<p>October 2: Brandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Lori's niece Melanie Pawlowski, is targeted in a drive-by shooting in Arizona. Police identify the vehicle carrying the shooter as a Jeep registered to Charles Vallow, Lori's late husband. </p>

<p>October 19: Chad's wife Tammy, 49, dies at their Idaho home. An obituary states that she passed away peacefully in her sleep. Chad declines an autopsy and her death is listed as natural causes.</p>

<p>October 25: A friend of Tylee receives a vague 'miss you' text from her phone but says that it didn't sound like the teen.   </p>

<p>November 5: Lori and Chad tie the knot on a beach in Kauai. Receipts indicate that Lori purchased her own wedding ring from Amazon nearly three weeks prior to Tammy's death. </p>

<p>November 26: Out-of-state relatives ask Idaho police to perform a welfare check on JJ. Lori and Chad claim he is in Arizona with relatives and ask their friend, Melanie Gibb, to lie and say she took the boy there for Thanksgiving. Police soon learn that no one has seen JJ, or his older sister Tylee, since September. </p>

<p>November 27: Police execute a search warrant related to the children at Lori's home and discover that she and Chad have fled Idaho.</p>

<p>December 11: Tammy's body is exhumed from a Utah cemetery and her death is reclassified as suspicious.</p>

<p>December 12: Lori's brother, Alex Cox, is found unresponsive in a bathroom in Arizona and dies. Months later an autopsy determines that he died of natural causes while he had the overdose drug Narcan in his system. </p>

<p>December 21: Rexburg police issue the first press release about JJ and Tylee, revealing they believe their disappearance could be linked to Tammy's death and asking the public for information.</p>

<p>December 24: Lori and Chad issue a statement through an attorney saying they love their son and daughter and look forward to addressing 'allegations once they have moved beyond speculation and rumor'.</p>

<p>December 30: Police accuse Lori and Chad of lying to investigators and say they believe the couple know where the kids are or what happened to them.</p>

<p>January 3, 2020: Police search Chad's home in Salem and remove 43 items, including tech devices and journals. They also comb over sections of the snow-covered yard with rakes and metal detectors.</p>

<p>January 26: Lori and Chad are seen for the first time in months as police serve them with two search warrants in Kauai. Lori is also served with a court order to produce the children to authorities in Idaho in five days. The couple are approached by the media while officers serve the documents and refuse to say anything about the children.</p>

<p>January 30: Lori misses the court deadline to produce the children to Idaho authorities.</p>

<p>February 20: Lori is arrested in Kauai and charged with two felony counts for desertion and nonsupport of dependent children, and one misdemeanor count each for resisting and obstructing an officer, solicitation of a crime, and contempt of court. </p>

<p>March 5: Lori is extradited to Idaho, where she is held on $1million bond at Madison County Jail.</p>

<p>March 17: Lori professes her innocence in a statement through her attorney as two other members of her defense team quit and the judge removes himself from the case. </p>

<p>March 24: Court documents filed in the divorce of Lori's niece Melani and her husband Brandon Boudreaux allege that Lori told people she believed her children were zombies before they disappeared. </p>

<p>April 9: Authorities reveal they are investigating Lori and Chad for murder, attempted murder and conspiracy in connection with Tammy's death.</p>

<p>May 25: Idaho police issue a statement expressing hope that the kids will be found safe on what would have been JJ's eighth birthday. </p>

<p>June 9: Police search Chad's home in Salem for the second time and discover human remains in the backyard. Chad is taken into police custody and charged with destruction or concealment of evidence.</p>
