        <p>DailyMailTV host Thomas Roberts enjoyed a sweet virtual reunion with his former NBC colleagues on Monday morning as he joined Today hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie to celebrate the season four launch of the Emmy Award-winning news show. </p>

<p>Thomas, 47, who worked as an anchor and reporter for MSNBC, the Today show, and NBC Nightly News, joined Savannah, 48, and Hoda, 56, to give a sneak peek into some of the biggest stories that will air on DailyMailTV in the coming days, as the show kicks off its fourth season. </p>

<p>Speaking to his former colleagues and friends via video link, Thomas shared his excitement at joining the show, while sharing some fond memories with the Today hosts. </p>

<p>Celebration: DailyMailTV host Thomas Roberts joined Today on Monday morning to kick of season four of the Emmy Award-winning show</p>

<p>Reunion: The 47-year-old TV host was given a very warm welcome by his former NBC colleagues, who shared their excitement over the show's season four premiere </p>

<p>Sneak peek: Thomas shared some insight into a few of the most exciting stories that will be airing on the show, including some exclusive details about Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</p>

<p>The seasoned TV host was welcomed onto Today by Craig Melvin, 41, who revealed that Thomas was actually one of his 'first friends' at NBC. </p>

<p>'DailyMailTV premieres its fourth season today with a new host, and a pal and former colleague, Thomas Roberts, one of my first friends here at NBC News,' Craig said while introducing the TV pro. </p>

<p>'I'm really excited about this,' Thomas told his friend, adding: 'It is season four, we do launch this week [and] today is my first official day with our premiere. Last week we had our soft launch. </p>

<p>'DailyMailTV has been around for four seasons, I've been a fan from the start, and obviously Daily Mail is something that we utilize - or I did utilize in my life inside that building.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'But this is a great TV show; it's got politics, it's got exclusive celebrities stories, it's got everything you want, and then Craig... it's got me!' </p>

<p>Savannah was more than happy to agree with Thomas, joking: 'You took the words right out of my mouth, that's what I was going to say, that's the main dish right there, we are so happy to have you. </p>

<p>'That's the main dish right there,' she continued, before admitting: 'That sounds terrible, but we are so happy to have you! You know what I mean, we've been friends for a long time.' </p>

<p>Something special: He also revealed that DailyMailTV will be offering an exclusive look inside a redone Manhattan penthouse belonging to a high-profile New Yorker </p>

<p>Memories: The group traded fond stories about their time together at NBC, with Hoda sharing her joy at Thomas's return to New York, after spending some time working in Atlanta</p>

<p>Thomas then went on to share a sneak peek into the upcoming stories that he is most excited about airing, explaining that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic will be 'leading the charge' this fall, as well as the 2020 election. </p>

<p>'Those insider nugget stories that you just find so interesting from the Daily Mail we are going to have for you, plus we've got some great celebrity exclusives that you'll find nowhere else,' he said. </p>

<p>Pointing out that Savannah and Hoda are both Real Housewives fans, he then shared a hint at an upcoming story that might tickle their fancy above all else. </p>

<p>'I know you guys are Real Housewives fans right?' he asked, before revealing: 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills... Brandi Glanville, you've probably seen some of that stuff with Denise Richards, we've got inside scoop that puts the whole thing together with exclusive text messages and the conversations that you are only going to find one place, with us, DailyMailTV. </p>

<p>'I'm very excited about that.'  </p>

<p>For those viewers who aren't as excited about the latest gossip from the Bravo stars, Thomas also revealed that the show will be offering an 'exclusive look at a redone Manhattan townhouse' belonging to a high-profile New Yorker who will be offering a $2 million 'COVID discount on the purchase price'. </p>

<p>Colleagues: Thomas, pictured with Hoda on the Today show, previously worked as an anchor and reporter for MSNBC, the Today show, and NBC Nightly News</p>

<p>Kick-off: Season four of DailyMailTV premieres today, Monday, September 14, and will see Thomas joining senior correspondent Alicia Quarles (pictured) </p>

<p>The Today anchors then shared their joy at seeing Thomas back in New York, after he spent two years living in Atlanta, Georgia, where he served as the evening news anchor at WGCL-TV (CBS46).</p>

<p>'Thomas I want to say, we miss you... we used to hang with you across the street at 30 Rock,' Hoda said. 'We're happy you moved back to New York City, and we hope to see you around here soon.' </p>

<p>Her warm sentiments were shared by her colleagues, who also sent their love to Thomas's husband, Patrick Abner, while urging their viewers to check out their local listings and tune into DailyMailTV's season premiere. </p>

<p>'Patrick is going to be excited to see you all,' Thomas said. 'And Hoda I love you guys and it's so nice to be back.' </p>

<p>Thomas will make his official DailyMailTV debut on Monday afternoon, one month to the day since he was named as the new host of the Emmy-winning news show.  </p>

<p>At the time, the award-winning TV host - who is has been the recipient of the prestigious Edward R. Murrow Award for Best Documentary as well as a national Emmy award while at NBC for Outstanding Live Coverage of the Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage, a Human Rights Campaign's Visibility Award and the Vito Russo GLAAD Award - shared his excitement at joining the show, explaining that he has 'been a fan and viewer since day one'. </p>

<p>'DailyMailTV is an amazing show and I've been a fan and viewer since day one,' he said.</p>

<p>A trusted and respected veteran of television news for over 25 years, Roberts has worked at a variety of local, cable, syndicated and national platforms including NBC News and CNN. He's pictured (right) with his husband Patrick Abner and with Robin Roberts and her partner Amber Laign</p>

<p>Roberts has appeared on The View and is pictured here with The View creator Barbara Walters, current host Whoopi Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy </p>

<p>'I've always been impressed by DailyMailTV as it consistently delivers important, interesting and exclusive stories while dominating in breaking the news that matters to Americans,' he added. </p>

<p>'The depth and style of news coverage delivered by DailyMailTV keeps its viewers engaged, informed and coming back for more. I can't wait to get started. '</p>

<p>Martin Clarke, Publisher of DMG Media and Executive Producer of DailyMailTV, added: 'In a year where the world is battling a pandemic and Americans are heading to the polls to decide on their next President, DailyMailTV will be there to keep its viewers informed with the news that matters to them.</p>

<p>'As we move into season four, in September, I'm looking forward to Thomas joining the team and bringing his unique style of reporting to DailyMailTV.'</p>

<p>Carla Pennington, Executive Producer of DailyMailTV, said: 'I've admired Thomas' work for many years and am delighted he will be joining the team.</p>

<p>'I've always been impressed by his ability to pivot from the hard yet important news to the showbiz stories people can't get enough of.' </p>

<p>Executive Producer Jeffrey Wilson said, 'I have known Thomas for many years, having had the pleasure of working with him in the past. He is a hard-working consummate professional who is committed to delivering the news in a direct and relatable way. We at DailyMailTV are thrilled that Thomas is joining the team and look forward to a successful new season.' </p>

<p>DailyMailTV made a splash when it first arrived on television screens in 2017, scoring the highest rated national debut of any syndicated newsmagazine since 2007.</p>

<p>DailyMailTV brings to life the world's most popular news website DailyMail.com on television. Working hand in hand, it has consistently broken news stories that have set the agenda, including Ghislaine Maxwell's hideout in Massachusetts, Asia Argento's first interview after the death of Anthony Bourdain, the collapse of Sex and the City 3, the first interview with Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Lisa Vanderpump announcing she was departing the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>In May 2019, DailyMailTV won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment News Program at the 46th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards.</p>

<p>'DailyMailTV really stands out and you can't find anything else like it in news. Plus, when you consider it comes from the global brand of DailyMail.com you know this show has few equals out there, if any!' Thomas continued.</p>

<p>A trusted and respected veteran of television news for over 25 years, Thomas has worked at a variety of local, cable, syndicated and national platforms. </p>

<p>He has previously reported for CBS News and The Insider/Entertainment Tonight in Los Angeles, CNN in Atlanta and several local stations in Portsmouth, Virginia, Ft. Myers, Florida, Lincoln, Nebraska and San Diego.</p>

<p>'After 25 amazing years in TV News, whether as an anchor or correspondent, I've had some pretty incredible ''career firsts.'' But this is the first time I've ever been this excited to start and just get to work.</p>

<p>'These are really important times, with very important stories that need to be covered, correctly. Plus, I'm just like you, I can't stand BS and hypocrites. So let's get started because we've got plenty of work to do,' he said.</p>

<p>Roberts has been based in New York City and previously served as an anchor and reporter for MSNBC, The Today Show and NBC Nightly News</p>

<p>Roberts co-hosted the 2013 Miss Universe pageant along with Mel B from Moscow, Russia  and is seen on the set with Donald Trump and television producer Barry Adleman</p>
