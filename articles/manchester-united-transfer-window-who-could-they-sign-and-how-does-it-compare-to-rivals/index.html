    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>While all their top-four rivals continue to strengthen their squads, Manchester United are moving at a pedestrian pace by comparison.</p>

<p>Donny van de Beek remains the club's only summer signing to date with the transfer deadline slightly over a fortnight away on October 5.</p>

<p>Former Red Devils centre back Rio Ferdinand is the latest club legend to speak out against their lack of activity so far.</p>

<p>Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has only made one signing this window</p>

<p>Midfielder Donny van de Beek arrived earlier this month from Ajax in a £40million transfer </p>

<p>Comparing United's business to Chelsea's, Ferdinand told Five YouTube Channel: 'Frank (Lampard) has made signing players like it's the norm, like it's easy - water off a duck's back.</p>

<p>'The difference in the way Chelsea have done their business compared to say my team Man United… there is no noise, there's nothing going on, all you're seeing is bang - deal.</p>

<p>'Little bit of talk, bang-deal. That is what's frustrating for me and all the Man United fans.'</p>

<p>So, why have United been slow in the market so far? Sportsmail analyses why...</p>

<p>United legend Rio Ferdinand is unhappy at their lack of transfer activity calling it 'frustrating'</p>

<p>So far, just Van de Beek who joined in a £40million transfer from Dutch giants Ajax earlier this month. </p>

<p>The 23-year-old automatically bolsters Manchester United's central midfield options - which looked particularly light around the festive period.</p>

<p>The Dutchman could now form part of an exciting midfield trio alongside Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes. While it is a welcome addition, more is needed at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>Van de Beek improves United and could now form part of a tantalising midfield for Solskjaer</p>

<p>Not great, not great at all. Manchester United may have finished third last season but they would do well to repeat that display following their rivals' investment.</p>

<p>Champions Liverpool have also made one just one signing so far, in left back Kostas Tsimikas, but they are closing on midfielder Thiago Alcantara. The Bayern Munich superstar is one of the world's best and is without doubt a statement signing.</p>

<p>Runners-up Manchester City have bolstered in the shape of exciting winger Ferran Torres and centre back Nathan Ake - both have been linked with a move to United this summer.</p>

<p>Liverpool have agreed a £25m fee with Bayern Munich for Spanish midfielder Thiago Alcantara</p>

<p>Nathan Ake has joined Manchester City - in a move that'll bolster their defensive options</p>

<p>Arsenal have been shrewd in the market and Willian made an impressive debut in the 3-0 win over Fulham, assisting all three goals, while Tottenham have brought Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Matt Doherty to improve their starting XI. Spurs are close to completing the return of Gareth Bale from Real Madrid too, albeit on loan, which will add an undoubted X-factor to an impressive frontline that includes Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.</p>

<p>Without doubt though, Chelsea have caught the eye this transfer window. The Blues who finished below United on goal difference last term, who have spent more than £230m on six players so far. Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Kai Havertz can all expect to start for Lampard's side, hence Ferdinand's comments.</p>

<p>Real Madrid outcast Gareth Bale is on the verge of re-joining Tottenham - via a loan move</p>

<p>Chelsea have splashed the cash this window - including the £89million arrival of Kai Havertz</p>

<p>A right winger is a priority - a position the club have failed to fill properly since Nani's departure. Mason Greenwood excelled in that role after football's restart, but manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer knows he needs to sign a permanent fixture there allowing Greenwood to develop as a central striker.</p>

<p>A left back and a centre back are the two other causes for concern. Luke Shaw is first-choice in the former but the England international has been beset by injuries so cover is needed. </p>

<p>Brandon Williams performed brilliantly there throughout last season, but he could be switched to right back - vying for that role with Aaron Wan-Bissaka. As for centre back, it's clear that a more athletic defender would compliment the skills of captain Harry Maguire.</p>

<p>United have been crying out for a right winger since the departure of Portuguese flyer Nani</p>

<p>A more athletic centre back to partner Harry Maguire (right) wouldn't go amiss at Old Trafford</p>

<p>Very good question considering United's transfer policy this window.</p>

<p>Jadon Sancho remains the No 1 target and would undoubtedly improve their frontline - in what would be a true statement of intent to United's rivals.</p>

<p>Sancho provides skill, poise, end product and overall X-factor that would provide another weapon in United's armoury and his numbers this season testify to that. </p>

<p>In 32 Bundesliga games for Dortmund he scored an incredible 17 goals alongside 16 assists as they finished second. This output made him Dortmund's top goalscorer and assist-maker in the league.</p>

<p>Dortmund's Jadon Sancho would be an automatic starter in United's line-up on the right wing</p>

<p>However, United have been at loggerheads with Borussia Dortmund over their £108m valuation for the forward. And as a result, United are looking at other targets to fill the right-flank void.    </p>

<p>Bayern Munich's Kingsley Coman, Juventus' Douglas Costa and Ivan Perisic from Inter Milan are all alternative targets. Out of those aforementioned names, Perisic is the most likely to join but his age (31) is a detrimental factor to United's youthful transfer policy.</p>

<p>They want a back up left back and are talking to agent Pini Zahavi about Alex Telles at Porto in what could be a potential £17m transfer. Meanwhile, at centre back Dayot Upamecano remains one option but Bayern Munich are among his suitors and any move for the RB Leipzig star is more likely next summer.</p>

<p>As for in attack, Josh King is hoping United reignite their interest for him after they failed to re-sign the Bournemouth forward in the January transfer window.</p>

<p>Alex Telles could be signed as a back-up left back by United in a £17m transfer from Porto</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands that there is a feeling United don't have the money to pay the big fees required for targets at the moment such as with Sancho.</p>

<p>With the coronavirus pandemic affecting everyone, United would prefer to pay large sums via decent installments or alternatively do loan deals with obligations to buy outright afterwards. A right winger on loan, for example, is the more likely outcome at present unless Dortmund change their stance on Sancho and accept a package of several installments. At present, that is not happening.</p>

<p>United are determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past few years which has seen them make some costly errors in the transfer market. And this has been heightened by the pandemic.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands that the Red Devils don't have the finances available to buy Sancho</p>

<p>Speaking about the club's financial situation in April, United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward warned that big-money transfers 'ignore the realities that face the sport'.</p>

<p>'We have always believed that our commercial model gives us greater resilience than most clubs and we are grateful for the enduring support of our commercial partners in helping us achieve that,' he said.</p>

<p>'However, nobody should be under any illusions about the scale of challenge facing everyone in football and it may not be 'business as usual' for any clubs, including ourselves, in the transfer market this summer.</p>

<p>'As ever, our priority is the success of team, but we need visibility of the impact across the whole industry, including timings of the transfer window, and the wider financial picture, before we can talk about a return to normality.</p>

<p>'On this basis, I cannot help feeling that speculation around transfers of individual players for hundreds of millions of pounds this summer seems to ignore the realities that face the sport.'</p>

<p>However, this conservative approach doesn't look good in comparison to their top-four rivals - and especially Chelsea.</p>

<p>United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward had warned big-money deals may not happen</p>

<p>Supporters are growing increasingly tired at the apparent ineptitude of Woodward and the Glazer family. Woodward has been at the helm since 2013 and the Old Trafford faithful can count multiple botched signing attempts - starting from Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas in his first year.</p>

<p>Speaking to Sportsmail this month, United legend Gary Neville was critical of the way the club does its business - citing the negotiations for Sancho as a prime example.</p>

<p>'Like everyone else they had three months off because of coronavirus, so I don't think it should be the case they didn't have the resource or time to get things done,' he said.</p>

<p>Like Ferdinand, fellow United legend Gary Neville has been vocal against their transfer policies</p>

<p>'Chelsea got their business done, [Manchester] City have got three or four pieces done. I don't think timing's the issue.</p>

<p>'It's just a thing with United that every time they go for a player in the last four, five, six years it feels they are a little bit desperate.</p>

<p>'They think they can hang on but they always pay it [the asking price] in the end.</p>

<p>'That's sometimes where I think you can take control, give a hard deadline and say "we're moving away from this deal".'</p>

<p>He believes the Red Devils should have moved away from Sancho and focused on other targets</p>

<p>On Thursday, Woodward was trending on Twitter with fans frustrated at the lack of signings to improve Solskjaer's squad.</p>

<p>'We are heading for a repeat of 2013 transfer window. Thank you Ed Woodward, Glazers and co. #GlazerOutWoodwardOut,' wrote one fan.</p>

<p>'Ed Woodward trending, not surprised. It's about time, get him out of the club or at least far far away from the decision making of transfers. #edwoodwardout #glazersout,' wrote another.</p>

<p>'Ed Woodward is such an incompetent negotiator. We’ve seen it time and time again. Tired of it all,' tweeted another unhappy supporter.</p>

<p>Woodward was trending on Twitter on Thursday with many United supporters unhappy at him</p>

<p>Yes. Aside from the Sancho negotiations that is the not the only potential deal that's gone awry.</p>

<p>Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish was a target of United's but Villa's initial asking price of £100m was miles from their valuation. The Red Devils tried and failed in a bid to lower this valuation and their financial situation saw them ultimately pull out of any deal. As a result, Grealish signed a five-year deal with his boyhood club.</p>

<p>Bale is another player who has been linked with a move to Old Trafford but ultimately is not heading to the Theatre of Dreams. The Welshman is heading to Tottenham but United were keen on him but messed up in their approach to try and attain him. They chose to go directly through Real Madrid, while Spurs maintained contact through his representatives and were ultimately able to arrange a better deal.</p>

<p>If Van de Beek proves to be the only addition this window, then expect the pressure to intensify greatly on the board.</p>

<p>Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish was a United target but his £100m valuation was an obstacle</p>
