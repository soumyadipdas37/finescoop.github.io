    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Two Richmond stars will be kicked out of Queensland and suspended for ten games after they broke COVID-19 rules to visit a strip club on the Gold Coast.   </p>

<p>Sydney Stack, 20, and Callum Coleman-Jones, 21 were allegedly involved in an altercation after being evicted from Hollywood Showgirls on the glitter strip's Orchid Ave at 3.27am on Friday morning.</p>

<p>Footage from a kebab shop where they bought two kebabs each allegedly shows the pair fighting in the street.</p>

<p>The incident has sparked outrage after Queensland's premier proudly welcomed AFL players and officials into the state so the season could go ahead away from coronavirus-stricken Melbourne. </p>

<p>Her decision has been called a double-standard because everyday Australians are still banned from entering Queensland.</p>

<p>This is despite ordinary Australians being denied exemptions for medical emergencies and banned from visiting sick family members. </p>

<p>The AFL said the pair breached the code's return to play protocols by taking an Uber, visiting a non-approved Gold Coast venue and becoming involved in the incident which required police.  </p>

<p>Following an investigation by the league and Richmond Tigers, Stack and Coleman-Jones will be immediately sent home from the Sunshine State and suspended for ten matches.</p>

<p>The suspension will stretch across the remainder of the 2020 season, finals and the beginning of the 2021 season. The suspension will begin in Round 17 as the Tigers have a bye in Round 16.  </p>

<p>Richmond stars Sydney Stack (pictured), 20, and Callum Coleman-Jones, 21, were reportedly thrown out of a Gold Coast strip club before brawling on the street on Thursday night</p>

<p>The pair were involved in an altercation after being evicted from Hollywood Showgirls (pictured) on the glitter strip's Orchid Ave at 3.30 Friday morning</p>

<p>Queensland Police said in a statement that two men were issued with an infringement notice for public nuisance, fined $800 each and both sustained facial injuries during a brawl.</p>

<p>'Police arrested two men following a disturbance in Surfers Paradise early this morning,' the statement read.</p>

<p>'Around 3.30am, officers responded to reports of two men, aged 20 and 21, involved in a physical altercation on Orchid Avenue.</p>

<p>'Both men sustained facial injuries as a result of the incident.</p>

<p>'The men were both issued with a Police Banning Notice, excluding them from Gold Coast Safe Night Precincts and a Penalty Infringement Notice (PIN) for Public Nuisance (Violent Behaviour). Further investigations are continuing into the matter.' </p>

<p>CCTV footage taken outside the club appears to show an unknown man instigating a fight. Coleman-Jones was then punched twice before he and Stack allegedly retaliate. </p>

<p>The brawl reportedly started after Stack, who has played nine games for Richmond this season, visited a kebab shop a short distance to the strip club. </p>

<p>Mick Akca, the owner of Kebab Zone next door to the club, told Daily Mail Australia the two men weren't looking for a fight.</p>

<p>Mick Akca, the owner of Kebab Zone next door to the club, told Daily Mail Australia the two men weren't looking for a fight</p>

<p>Mr Akca went so far as to say they were his best customers all night, commending them for being polite and respectful when dealing with him</p>

<p>They were sitting out the front of his store and looked 'exhausted' when they were approached by a third man, who Met Akca claims appeared excessively intoxicated.</p>

<p>'The drunk guy came to disturb them. They were just sitting down eating their kebabs. They asked him to go and one lifted his hand up to tell him to leave,' Mr Akca explained.</p>

<p>The drunk man fell backwards and onto the floor, and when he stood up, Mr Akca claims he lunged at the men.</p>

<p>'It wasn't a bad fight. There are always fights around here, the security guard broke it up straight away.</p>

<p>'The two football players did nothing wrong. I can't blame them for anything.'</p>

<p>Mr Akca went so far as to say they were his best customers all night, commending them for being polite and respectful when dealing with him.</p>

<p>'They really didn't seem that drunk at all. Some customers like to give us a hassle, but they didn't.'</p>

<p>Mr Akca said after the fight has been broken up, they apologised for the nuisance and ordered two more kebabs because theirs had been dropped during the melee.  </p>

<p>The AFL is aware of the matter and is currently investigating. Pictured: Richmond Tigers star Sydney Stack</p>

<p>Queensland Police said in a statement that two men were issued with an infringement notice for public nuisance (violent behaviour). Pictured: Callum Coleman-Jones </p>

<p>Hollywood Showgirls boss Craig Duffy issued a tongue-in-cheek statement on Friday afternoon refusing to reveal any details of the evening.</p>

<p>'To our valued customers. What happens in Hollywood stays in Hollywood,' he said.</p>

<p>'We value our customers privacy whether they be an unknown client or a high profile celebrity or athlete.</p>

<p>'We cannot confirm or deny any fight or eviction occurred.'</p>

<p>About 400 AFL players, their families and officials have descended on Queensland under controversial quarantine arrangements.</p>

<p>They were given the all-clear to dodge the state's border lockdown. </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk has been accused of ignoring the needs of ordinary Australians, instead inviting in rich and glamorous players and AFL executives.</p>

<p>It comes amid reports WAGs and officials are living it up in 'hotel quarantine' - sipping cocktails while lounging by the pool at their luxury Gold Coast resort. </p>

<p>'We are doing this quarantine the same as everyone else,' AFL boss Gill McLachlan said this week.</p>

<p>But images and video that emerged on Thursday tell a different story - with the officials and families chilling out at the 4.5 star Mercure Gold Coast resort. </p>

<p>AFL WAGs and officials lounge by the Mercure's pool during their hotel quarantine on the Gold Coast (pictured)</p>

<p>Birds eye video footage of the quarantine hotel showed AFL officials and WAGs make the most of the luxury Mercure resort</p>

<p>Aerial footage - published by Nine News on Thursday - showed WAGs relaxing by the swimming pool at the quarantine resort as children splashed in the water.</p>

<p>The wives and girlfriends soaked up the sun with drinks in hand, just a few steps away from the poolside bar.</p>

<p>The vision is a world away from the experience of other travellers who have desperately fought to enter Queensland.</p>

<p>Jayne Brown, 60, spent two weeks confined to a tiny hotel room in Brisbane following her recent return from Sydney, where renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo removed two large tumours on her brain.</p>

<p>The grandmother-of-seven requested an exemption from hotel quarantine to self-isolate at home on the Sunshine Coast, but was rejected twice.</p>

<p>Not even a letter from Dr Teo himself could convince Queensland officials to change their mind and allow Ms Brown and her husband to isolate at their home.</p>

<p>Instead, she struggled through hotel confinement in agony unable to walk and limited access to pain relief.</p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been criticised for easing her strict border controls to welcome the officials and their loved ones from coronavirus-riddled Victoria</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Queensland grandmother was forced to recover from brain surgery in a quarantine hotel, while AFL officials have been exempt from strict quarantine rules </p>

<p>'I was in a wheelchair, I couldn't walk, my right leg was compromised, it was numb, it was weak, I couldn't stand on it,' she said.</p>

<p>'I wasn't well at all and got shuffled into a five-by-five hotel room and just left there.' </p>

<p>She blasted Ms Palaszczuk for allowing the AFL officials to enter the state on Tuesday night. </p>

<p>'I don't understand it, mind-blowing,' Ms Brown told Nine News. </p>

<p>The Queensland government has deemed all of Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT to be coronavirus hotspots.</p>

<p>Travellers from hotspot states who are granted a border declaration pass are required to spend 14 days in mandatory hotel quarantine, at their own cost. </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk was slammed last week for saying Queensland's hospitals were 'for our people only'.</p>

<p>A heavily pregnant mother was forced to wait 16 hours for emergency surgery in Sydney after being turned away at the Queensland border, before losing one of her unborn twin babies.</p>

<p>A heavily pregnant mother was forced to wait 16 hours for emergency surgery in Sydney after being turned away at the Queensland border, before losing one of her unborn twin babies</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk initially did not grant the seriously ill mum-to-be's exemption despite her needing emergency surgery for the unborn twins.</p>

<p>The mother, from Ballina in New South Wales which is 88km from the Queensland border, had twins who were just 24 weeks along and needed urgent care.</p>

<p>She wasn't initially granted an exemption to cross the border for surgery at the Gold Coast University Hospital 125km away and instead had to wait for 16 hours in Lismore for a flight to Sydney.</p>

<p>The woman's father Allan Watt says one of the twins became anaemic during surgery at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney.</p>

<p>Do you think there is a double standard when it comes to Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's border closures?</p>

<p>Do you think there is a double standard when it comes to Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's border closures?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>Mr Watt said the family were very upset about his daughter being denied an exemption.</p>

<p>Queensland Chief Officer Dr Jeannette Young said the NSW woman's exemption had been approved as soon as her application had been made.</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk had said last week while she was not aware of the specifics of the case, the decision about who to let into Queensland would be made by health professionals, not politicians.</p>

<p>'People living in NSW have NSW hospitals. In Queensland, we have Queensland hospitals for our people,' she said. </p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg accused the Queensland government of double standards, saying the football hub showed two sets of rules on borders given regular punters had missed out on vital medical treatment.</p>

<p>'It's just not on that a young woman can lose an unborn child because of confusion at the borders,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday. </p>

<p>'At the same time, footy officials can go down to their hotel bar as they so-called quarantine in Queensland.</p>

<p>Moree Plains Shire Mayor Katrina Humphries (pictured) said Mungindi's 600 locals would be forced to leave their border bubble to travel to Mooree to buy supplies and access doctors</p>

<p>Victoria: Completely open, but other states are banning residents from going there</p>

<p>NSW: Border with Victoria is closed but others are open without restriction</p>

<p>Queensland: Open to everywhere but Victoria, NSW, and the ACT</p>

<p>Northern Territory: Open to everywhere but Victoria and Sydney, which must do hotel quarantine</p>

<p>South Australia: Closed to Victoria, NSW arrivals must self-isolate, rest are open</p>

<p>Tasmania: Closed to Victoria, everywhere else must do hotel quarantine</p>

<p>Western Australia: Closed to everywhere without an exemption </p>

<p>'It seems double standards on our borders.'</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk has copped widespread criticism from politicians, television personalities and the public. </p>

<p>Sunrise host Samantha Armytage on Friday again blasted the 'silly' Queensland Premier over her tough border closures that have left one desperate bush community with no food.</p>

<p>Armytage said her 'blood was boiling' on Thursday as Ms Palaszczuk refuses to budge with the border restrictions that have torn families apart and left small country towns struggling to stay afloat.</p>

<p>Armytage on Friday slammed the Labor premier again, pointing out how struggling Australians weren't given border exemptions to access food or medical attention.</p>

<p>'Annastacia Palaszczuk would say she's trying to protect her state,' Armytage said on Friday morning.</p>

<p>'These sorts of things are silly and unnecessary, particularly when you see pictures of AFL executives laying around the pool in what they call quarantine.'</p>

<p>The Sunrise host also revealed that after multiple requests to bring the Queensland premier onto the show, she was still refusing to answer questions.    </p>

<p>A fire tore through Mungindi, a drought-stricken town on both sides of the Queensland and New South Wales border, wiping out its only supermarket and butcher.</p>

<p>But due to Ms Palaszczuk's hard border closures, locals have been forced to leave their border bubble to get essentials, or travel 160km to the nearest supermarket within the bubble.</p>

<p>NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has made scathing remarks over Ms Palaszczuk's border closures, saying the Queensland premier 'is refusing to budge' </p>

<p>Moree Plains Shire Mayor Katrina Humphries said Mungindi's 600 locals would be forced to leave their border bubble to travel to Mooree to buy supplies - 120km away.</p>

<p>The stern criticism of Ms Palaszczuk's border closure comes after New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian made a scathing review of her counterpart.</p>

<p>'Can I be absolutely frank, she has made a decision and isn't willing to talk about that decision and is refusing to budge,' Ms Berejiklian told 2GB radio station.</p>

<p>'It's not through want of trying. I've tried to establish a positive relationship but it's a bit difficult when decisions are made without them even telling us. </p>

<p>'And can I compare that to [Labor's Victorian Premier] Dan Andrews and the Prime Minister, the three of us worked together on a very difficult decision on the Victoria-NSW border, and I'd like to see that applied to all borders.' </p>
