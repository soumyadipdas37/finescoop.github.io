    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Tatler has unveiled its annual pick of the best prep and public schools in the UK.</p>

<p>The society bible's Schools Guide 2021 is packed with world-class educational institutions for children aged four to 18 - and unsurprisingly, many come with eye-watering fees. </p>

<p>Schools that offer yoga classes, eye-opening trips to orphanages in places such as Ghana and Cambodia, and lunchtime chefs hailing from The Ritz and Michelin-star restaurants all make the annual guide - as does one that boasts a Bake Off finalist as a geography teacher. </p>

<p>And the prep school attended by Prince George and Princess Charlotte is praised for producing 'kind, thoughtful and creative' pupils who are 'willing to stand up and be heard'.</p>

<p>Yet again south London's Dulwich College tops the list when it comes to price - at £7,082 a term for day students and £14,782 for boarders. </p>

<p>There are dozens of fee-paying primary and secondary schools in Tatler's guide, available in the October edition of the magazine, but here FEMAIL shares a selection of the most awe-inspiring...</p>

<p>PUBLIC SCHOOLS </p>

<p>City of London School (boys only)</p>

<p>Term fees: £6,313 </p>

<p>The riverfront City of London school boasts some pretty spectacular views, with the dome of St Paul's Cathedral protruding from behind the building and The Shard visible from the pupils' lunchtime balconies</p>

<p>With alumni including Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe, it may not be Hogwarts, but the City of London School boys are 'unashamedly bright', with nearly half its A-Level students (46 per cent) achieving A* grades.</p>

<p>Understandably 20 per cent of its students obtain a place at Oxbridge, but according to headteacher Alan Bird, the real selling point of the school is its 'diverse pupil body', which he puts down to its City location which sees boys commute from across London via public transport.</p>

<p>The riverfront school also boasts some pretty spectacular views, with the dome of St Paul's Cathedral protruding from behind the building and The Shard visible from the pupils' lunchtime balconies.</p>

<p>And the school's bake sales are bound to be impressive, as Bake Off 2019 finalist Alice McFarlane is a geography teacher there.  </p>

<p>City of London School for Girls (girls only)</p>

<p>Term fees: £6,404</p>

<p>Despite its urban setting in the Barbican, girls at City of London School enjoy sports ranging from cricket and cross-country running to cheerleading</p>

<p>Renowned for its performing arts (Claudia Winkleman is among its alumni and almost every pupil learns an instrument) last year the school's senior production of Wizard of Oz - performed with City boys - went down a storm.</p>

<p>During lockdown, the students also engaged in virtual concerts and photography challenges during its 'Sourdough School' initiative.</p>

<p>Despite its urban setting in the Barbican, girls at City enjoy sports ranging from cricket and cross-country running to cheerleading.</p>

<p>There are exchanges in the pipeline with school in Canada and New Zealand, and a number of its gifted pupils travel across the pond for university, attending the likes of Brown, NYU and McGill.      </p>

<p>Bedales School, Petersfield (mixed)</p>

<p>Term fees: day £9,745; boarding £12,400</p>

<p>Benenden School, Kent (girls only) </p>

<p>Term fees: boarding £13,124</p>

<p>Girls at Benenden are encouraged to go out and 'seize every opportunity' - and headteacher Samantha Price is determined they're as prepared as they can be for the working world by ensuring they have Linkedin accounts and well honed CVs</p>

<p>It's easy to see why Benenden was a good fit for its most prestigious alumni, Princess Anne. </p>

<p>Its pupils parachute out of planes, trek to Annapurna base camp, play rugby, race self-built cars and team up with its partner school John Wallis Academy to build microlights. </p>

<p>There's also a team of counsellors, chaplains and nurses and an Affective Social Tracking system to help identify potential challenges a pupil may face.</p>

<p>Its six interconnected schools mean children can remain within the network from infancy to age 18.</p>

<p>Dulwich College (boys only)</p>
