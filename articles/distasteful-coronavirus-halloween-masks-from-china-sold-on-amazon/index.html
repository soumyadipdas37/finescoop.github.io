        <p>'Hugely distasteful' coronavirus Halloween masks which are made in China are being listed for sale on Amazon's UK website.</p>

<p>The latex masks, some of which are being sold at up to £30, resemble an illustration of the SARS-CoV-2019 virus - but with creepy eyes and a mouth.</p>

<p>They are being listed on the online marketplace by a number of sellers based in China - where the virus is thought to have originated - and are said to be 'suitable for adults and teenagers'.</p>

<p>One seller wrote in the product description that the mask will leave 'an amazing and lasting impression'.</p>

<p>It comes after the worldwide death toll for the virus this week reached one million people.</p>

<p>The masks have been branded 'hugely distasteful' by one parenting group, while Amazon has vowed to remove the listings from its website.</p>

<p>'Hugely distasteful' coronavirus Halloween masks which are made in China are being listed for sale on Amazon's UK website</p>

<p>The latex masks - some of which are being sold at up to £30 - are being listed on the online marketplace by a number of Chinese-based sellers. The 'non-toxic' masks are being marketed as suitable for adults and teenagers - with one seller claiming the mask will leave 'an amazing and lasting impression'</p>

<p>The full-face masks resemble an illustration of the SARS-CoV-2019 virus (pictured) - but with creepy eyes and a mouth</p>

<p>One of the listings, which was still on Amazon at the time of writing, is by YTFU EU - a seller listed as being from the Guangdong region of China.</p>

<p>The product is listed as a YTFU Corona Latex Horror Mask and is being sold for £14.59 with free delivery.</p>

<p>It is listed as being made of 'safe' and 'non-toxic' material with a 'terrible Corona design'.</p>

<p>The seller says the masks is suitable for most adults and teenagers and that 'wearing this Halloween Horror Mask will give you an amazing and lasting impression'.</p>

<p>Another brand, which is listed on Amazon as being sold by user yangqingwen1456, from the Chinese city of Zhenjiang, is selling one mask for £28.99.</p>

<p>The WWJJTT Halloween coronavirus mask claims to be made of 'natural nontoxic material, environmentally friendly, nontoxic and beautifully painted'.</p>

<p>The description adds: 'This mask can attract people's attention when wearing at the party. You can choose this mask, more ladies than before.'</p>

<p>One of the sellers promises to ship the product 'within six to ten days', with the mask set to arrive as early as October 21 - 10 days before Halloween - or as late as November 7 - which would be after the annual calendar date.  </p>

<p>The masks have been branded 'hugely distasteful' by one parenting group, while Amazon has vowed to remove the listings from its website.</p>

<p>The WWJJTT Halloween coronavirus mask claims to be made of 'natural nontoxic material, environmentally friendly, nontoxic and beautifully painted' </p>

<p>Another mask, called the 'Coronavirus Horror Latex Head Mask', which is no longer available to buy, is listed in the description as having a 'natural and realistic appearance, which is horrifying and creepy, and many children are afraid to come close.</p>

<p>'This will add more happy and active atmosphere to you.'</p>

<p>It adds: 'The latex virus full face mask is spacious enough to put on/off. There is no obstacle to vision and breathing, and it is highly breathable.'</p>

<p>The masks have attracted criticism by Rachel Power Rachel Power, Chief Executive of the Patients Association.</p>

<p>Plague doctors costumes are selling out at fancy dress stores as they are tipped to be one of the most popular Halloween costumes this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Medieval plague doctor outfits with long black robes, black tops hats, gloves and the distinctive beak masks are already sold out on some online stores.</p>

<p>The costumes were worn by doctors treating patients during the epidemics of bubonic plague that swept across western Europe.</p>

<p>Plague doctors often wore a head-to-toe leather or wax coat and a beak mask, which would be stuffed with sweet smelling herbs, dried flowers or a vinegar sponge to ward off the disease.</p>

<p>They also carried a rod to poke or fend off victims.</p>

<p>Jokers' Masquerade is selling a Medieval Plague Doctor Halloween costume, including a robe, collar, belt, hat and mask for £34.99.</p>

<p>Amazon has a plague doctors mask, black top hat, black hooded cape, black gloves and a cane for £27.99 and even a children's version, complete with blood splatters on the arm for £15.99. </p>

<p>Many people have taken to Twitter to reveal that they are wearing plague doctor costumes for Halloween this year.</p>

<p>Nayexus wrote: 'I'm being a plague doctor this Halloween and I swear if any child has the nerve to trick or treat at my house this year, I'm gonna give them live leeches.'</p>

<p>Raphael Mejia wrote: 'Plague doctor is gonna be my Halloween costume.'</p>

<p>Maria added: 'The amount of plague doctors we're gonna see this Halloween.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She told The Sun: 'These masks show a terrible lapse of judgement by the manufacturers and sellers, and I hope they will be removed from sale quickly.</p>

<p>'I've no doubt the great majority of people will find them hugely distasteful, and I can't imagine that many people would wish to wear one.'  </p>

<p>An Amazon spokesperson told MailOnline: 'All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.</p>

<p>'These products are being removed.'</p>

<p>Britain today recorded 7,108 more coronavirus cases and another 71 deaths — including a three-month high of seven in Scotland.</p>

<p>Daily infections are up 15 per cent on last Wednesday's 6,178 and almost 80 per cent higher than on Wednesday two weeks ago.</p>

<p>But Britain's infections are a far-cry from what they were during the darkest days of the crisis in March and April, when at least 100,000 people were becoming infected every day.</p>

<p>The Department of Health data also adds to evidence that the death count is now slowly starting to climb after weeks of surging infections.</p>

<p>For comparison, the number of victims announced today is almost double that of last Wednesday (37) and more than triple the figure a fortnight ago (20).</p>

<p>There have been more than 40,000 coronavirus related deaths in the UK so far. </p>

<p>A medium has blasted Poundland as being 'utterly irresponsible' for flogging ouija boards for Halloween.</p>

<p>Clairvoyant Julie Tetley claims the devices can 'destroy people's lives' and 'spirits can cause suicides'.</p>

<p>She fears she will be 'busy in the next couple of months' dealing with the fall-out from people dabbling in the dark arts by inadvertently summoning sinister spirits using the £1 prop.</p>

<p>Poundland is selling its Spirit Board for £1 nationwide as part of its 'Creepy Town' Halloween displays</p>

<p>The 64-year-old medium was horrified to discover the boards, a firm favourite in horror movies, were being sold as a Halloween decoration in the Scarborough branch of the store.</p>

<p>Although Julie accepts the board is merely a tool, she says it encourages people to 'open up their energies' and communicate with spirits - some more 'sinister' than others.</p>

<p>She claimed people should leave the so-called 'game' well alone as she believes the evil spirits can lead to suicides among those they 'attach' to.</p>

<p>Clairvoyant Julie Tetley, 64, claims the devices can 'destroy people's lives'</p>

<p>Poundland is selling its Spirit Board for £1 nationwide as part of its 'Creepy Town' Halloween displays. </p>

<p>Sale of the product is restricted to over 18s and the product is labelled 'for adults only'.</p>

<p>Julie, from Scarborough, said: 'It's totally and utterly irresponsible for Poundland to be selling this, it's horrendous.</p>

<p>'Children will buy them, they just want fun. They see it on TV, they don't understand what they're doing, it can destroy their lives in every way.</p>

<p>'It can bring negative influences around you all the time. They need to know the intent of using these boards is to speak to the spirit.</p>

<p>'Sometimes people say 'this board doesn't work, it hasn't moved' but they've already opened up that channel to spirits, then they'll know about it later.'</p>

<p>A medium all her life, Julie said that those untrained in energies may find themselves at the mercy of 'unscrupulous' characters looking to take advantage of them.</p>

<p>Julie said: 'You get people who were unscrupulous, people who would take advantage and people who were very very sinister here and you get the same in spirits.</p>

<p>Poundland said the sale of the product is restricted to over 18s and the product is labelled 'for adults only' (Pictured: stock image of Poundland store)</p>

<p>'Their personality is still who they are [in spirit form].</p>

<p>'If a darker energy attaches itself to someone who's naive they can just take advantage - they can cause stress and worry.</p>

<p>'They'll give them information that's right then all of a sudden this board will spell out something like there's going to be a fatal accident or one of your parents is going to be killed.</p>

<p>'They'll say something horrendous and have that person worried because the other things they've given have been true.</p>

<p>'It can cause a lot of stress, the spirit can start to manipulate through their mind - giving them bad thoughts and giving them thoughts of suicidal tendencies.</p>

<p>'It can almost cause suicide in the long-term so it's very, very dangerous.'</p>

<p>A Poundland spokesman said: 'Poundland is the home for Halloween and the Spirit Board is part of this year's extensive Halloween Decoration range.</p>

<p>'We understand the spirits shook in disbelief when they were told it was only £1. Just wait until people see the Voodoo dolls.'</p>
