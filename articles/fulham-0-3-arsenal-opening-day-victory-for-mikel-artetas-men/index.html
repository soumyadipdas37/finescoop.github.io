        <p>Arsenal kicked off their fresh Premier League campaign with all three points at the expense of newly promoted Fulham, continuing the rich run of form under manager Mikel Arteta.</p>

<p>The first goal of new Premier League season took only eight minutes to arrive, courtesy of Alexandre Lacazette. The Frenchman pounced after Fulham failed to clear their lines, making hard work of a Willian shot. </p>

<p>Failing to compose themselves upon the second half re-start, Fulham slipped again. Debut delight arrived for Arsenal new boy Gabriel Magalhaes, who rose powerfully an unopposed to head in from a corner.</p>

<p>By this point Arsenal had found their groove and had a firm grip on momentum. Captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang did not need a second invitation when given space to cut in from the left, and promptly curled the ball across goal for 3-0. </p>

<p>Match report to follow </p>

<p>A new season but the same old business for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored the third</p>

<p>The Gabon star couldn't hide his delight after opening his account in yet another campaign</p>

<p>Team-mates flocked around Aubameyang to celebrate his curled, long-range effort</p>

<p>As the second half started debut delight arrived for Arsenal new boy Gabriel Magalhaes</p>

<p>The Brazilian rose highest at a corner and powered a header in to give Arsenal a 2-0 lead</p>

<p>Alexandre Lacazette had slotted in from close range to score the first goal of the new season</p>

<p>Lacazette capitalised quickest after Willian's shot was spilled into his path at close range</p>

<p>The Frenchman was mobbed by his team-mates after getting off the mark inside 10 minutes</p>

<p>Fulham players trudged away with an air of dejection after conceding a goal so early in the tie</p>

<p>Aubameyang started the clash brightly, applying pressure to the Fulham back line</p>

<p>Scott Parker and Mikel Arteta prowled the touchline as their sides did battle on the pitch</p>

<p>Fulham made Arsenal wait before appearing, as the two teams lined up in west London</p>

<p>Fans are still missing the action, with the threat of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>SCROLL BELOW TO RECOUNT HOW ALL THE ACTION UNFOLDED, LIVE WITH SPORTSMAIL'S ADAM SHERGOLD.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>You'll be able to read the match report from Rob Draper at Craven Cottage by refreshing this page in a few minutes' time.</p>

<p>But the Premier League action comes thick and fast as usual. My colleague Kieran Jackson is poised to bring you live coverage of the 3pm kick-off between Crystal Palace and Southampton from Selhurst Park. </p>

<p>This ended up a very straightforward opening weekend assignment for Arsenal who have strolled to victory in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Goals from Alexandre Lacazette, Gabriel and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang underlined a dominant performance as Fulham received a harsh reminder that the Premier League is a step up. </p>

<p>Scott Parker's side will have many easier games than this but there's plenty of positives for the Gunners here as they cruise to three points in the season opener. </p>

<p>Arsenal almost home and dry. In terms of the contest here, they've been home and dry for quite some time. </p>

<p>Audacious to say the least from Bobby Decordova-Reid there who spotted Leno off his line some 50 yards from goal. His attempted lob was poor to say the least. </p>

<p>The third and final - yes, we're back to three subs this season - switch for Arsenal as the scorer of their third goal, Aubameyang, is replaced by Eddie Nketiah for the final five minutes.</p>

<p>Nketiah had a brilliant week for England under 21s. </p>

<p>Arsenal feel there are more goals on offer here. Dani Ceballos nutmegs Zambo Anguissa and bursts into the Fulham box before crossing. Nobody can steer the ball home. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hector living ever more dangerously on that earlier booking as he fouls Lacazette.</p>

<p>That must be the fourth or fifth challenge Hector has committed since getting the yellow. </p>

<p>Another sub by Arsenal as Dani Ceballos comes on for Granit Xhaka, who was still moving a little sluggishly following that Hector challenge a few minutes ago. </p>

<p>It could be any score from here in all honesty as Arsenal continue to press for more goals. </p>

<p>It's Aubameyang again, slipped through inside the Fulham box as he gets away from Michael Hector. Rodak comes out and is rounded but Aubameyang cannot squeeze his shot home. </p>

<p>Arsenal make a change and it's been a very good afternoon's work for Willian with two assists. He goes off and Pepe comes on. </p>

<p>For Fulham. Bobby Decordova-Reid is on for Josh Onomah. </p>

<p>Xhaka down on the turf after being caught on the foot by Michael Hector's follow-through after what was actually a good tackle in midfield.</p>

<p>It certainly looked a sore one for the Arsenal midfielder but he is eventually back on his feet. A little gingerly. </p>

<p>Hector walking the tightrope with another foul on a booking. From the free-kick, the ball is slipped back into Granit Xhaka's path. </p>

<p>He doesn't get a clean connection on the edge of the box and it's blocked. </p>

<p>Goodness me, it really should have been 4-0 there.</p>

<p>Tierney with an excellent pass down the line into Aubameyang, whose pace takes him away from the Fulham defenders so he can cut back a cross to Lacazette. </p>

<p>His low shot from just a few yards out is well blocked by Rodak and then Bellerin's follow up is also cleared.</p>

<p>The flag then goes up with Aubameyang's initial run a fraction too quick to remain onside.</p>

<p>Fulham looking to get at least one goal this afternoon and that's the first involvement for Mitrovic, who uses his strength to work some room before firing off a shot that Leno saves. </p>

<p>Little surprise that Fulham are turning to Aleksandar Mitrovic from the bench, replacing Kamara.</p>

<p>Zambo Anguissa is also entering the fray for Neeskens Kebano. </p>

<p>Fulham struggling to cope at the moment and the frustration spills over as Tom Cairney fouls Willian and goes into the book. </p>

<p>Game, set and match.</p>

<p>A gorgeous third goal for Arsenal, who launch a move from back to front that was finished off effortlessly by their captain Aubameyang.</p>

<p>Willian had the ball on the right, dinking it across to Aubameyang on the left side of the box. He simply cut inside the defender and curled home a lovely shot to get himself up and running in the Premier League for this season. </p>

<p>Not a bad response to conceding that soft second goal. Kamara picks the ball up for Fulham on the edge of the box and decides to try his luck. It was always bending away from goal and flew wide. </p>

<p>Fulham trying to work something down their left and Hector Bellerin wrestles Cavaleiro to the floor as the Fulham man tries to get past him. More akin to a rugby tackle that one.</p>

<p>Bellerin is shown a yellow card. </p>

<p>An interesting point there that that Gabriel goal could have been ruled out last season.</p>

<p>The ball touching the shoulder was often penalised for handball, especially when VAR was used. But this season, the rule has been changed so handball only counts as below the armpit.</p>

<p>So there was no problem as the ball glanced in off Gabriel's shoulder. </p>

<p>Rob Holding performing keepie uppies there as he broke through the middle before feeding a pass into Lacazette. His cross is deflected out for a corner.</p>

<p>And from it comes Arsenal's second. It's Gabriel, the Premier League newcomer, who continues his excellent debut. </p>

<p>A perfectly-delivered corner into the six-yard box by Willian and Gabriel outmuscled Hector to send the ball home off what appeared to be his shoulder rather than head.</p>

<p>But they all count and that could well be the game right there.</p>

<p>That was a terrific dribble by Aubameyang, who skipped smoothly through a series of Fulham challenges down the left. Lacazette was in the middle looking for the ball across but Ream stepped in to defuse the situation. </p>

<p>Fulham shooting towards the Hammersmith End at Craven Cottage in the second half, Arsenal towards the Putney End.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances that's where their respective sets of fans would be sat. But sadly not at the moment. </p>

<p>We are almost ready for the restart as first Arsenal and then Fulham make their way back out onto the Craven Cottage pitch. </p>

<p>Mikel Arteta will be satisfied with Arsenal's performance so far but knows they will probably need a second goal to kill the contest.</p>

<p>Scott Parker knows Fulham are still in the game but need to step it up a level. </p>

<p>Arsenal players Dani Ceballos and Eddie Nketiah got into a heated exchange during the warm-ups before their season opener against Fulham.</p>

<p>During a small-sided 'rondo' game, Ceballos appeared to become frustrated and put in a heavy challenge on the young striker.</p>

<p>The two appeared to have some strong words and then square up to each other as things almost came to blows.</p>

<p>Rob Draper at Craven Cottage: Half time at the Cottage. Gabriel on his Premier League debut looks to have played here all his life. Willian doing that thing he did for Chelsea so effectively. Arsenal look in complete control. No goal threat from Fulham.</p>

<p>Arsenal in front at the break then thanks to that scrambled opener by Alexandre Lacazette inside the first 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The Gunners have also enjoyed some other openings and they've enjoyed the lion's share of the possession. </p>

<p>But Fulham aren't entirely out of the contest. They have created some dangerous situations but Arsenal have looked solid so far. </p>

<p>The game currently coasting towards half-time. Arsenal will be delighted with their afternoon's graft so far. </p>

<p>Though Tierney has just clipped Neeskens Kebano in the corner to concede a quite unnecessary free-kick that is dealt with by the impressive-looking Gabriel. </p>

<p>Rob Draper at Craven Cottage: Lots of pretty football from Fulham but no real sense that they will ever be a threat and always the fear that another mistake will kill the game. Like other sides who come up and play nicely, like Norwich, they may win plaudits and lose games</p>

<p>Arsenal pushing for what could be a match-killing second goal before the break.</p>

<p>Ainsley Maitland-Niles picks up the ball on the left and delivers a really dangerous cross that Tim Ream deals with ahead of Lacazette. </p>

<p>You get the impression Arsenal can step it up another gear or two here.</p>

<p>Denis Odoi is fouled by Aubameyang close to the touchline and the Arsenal captain is the second name into the book this afternoon. </p>

<p>Aubameyang has better luck staying onside this time and he gets onto a lovely clipped ball over the top by Tierney that allows the striker to get goal-side of Hector. </p>

<p>Luckily for Fulham at this crucial stage of the game, Aubameyang's left-footed shot lacks power and Rodak saves at his near post. </p>

<p>Lacazette is the latest Arsenal player to get in behind the Fulham defence but his cross is well cut out by Tim Ream. Turns out Lacazette had strayed offside anyway. </p>

<p>The Gunners looking pretty comfortable as we enter the last 10 minutes of the first half. </p>

<p>When Fulham are able to string a few passes together, they do manage to push Arsenal back into a defensive five. </p>

<p>Eventually, they work it out wide to the right side and Odoi flashes in another tempting cross that nobody gambles on. </p>

<p>As it turns out Magalhaes was being fouled in the centre so any goal probably wouldn't have counted. </p>

<p>Willian stands over the free-kick as three Arsenal players stand behind the Fulham wall. Crafty. </p>

<p>Marek Rodak can't have a very good view but luckily for him, Willian's whipped free-kick bounces back off the base of the post. </p>

<p>A let-off for Fulham because Willian played the kick right through the gap left by his team-mates who'd joined the Fulham wall.</p>

<p>Hector clips Lacazette right on the edge of the 'D' and Arsenal have a free-kick in a really dangerous position. Hector goes into the book. </p>

<p>There's a quick VAR check as Tom Cairney catches Lacazette on the nose with his arm. Standard procedure these days of course. Nothing malicious from the Fulham man and play continues. </p>

<p>That's a lovely feint of feet by Elneny on the edge of the Fulham box, getting onto Lacazette's cute cut-back. Elneny opens his body up but Tim Ream blocks his shot and Granit Xhaka's follow-up is wild and over. </p>

<p>That's more encouraging for Fulham as they work the ball down the right side. Odoi fizzes a cross into the Arsenal box but nobody in white reads his intentions and Maitland-Niles clatters him for his troubles.</p>

<p>You needed Aleksandar Mitrovic in the box really but he's on the bench. </p>

<p>It's been all Arsenal since the goal. They're stroking the ball around and dominating possession with Fulham chasing. </p>

<p>Ainsley Maitland-Niles retrieves the ball on the left side but can't pick out another blue shirt with his cross. He's getting so much space out there and Kieran Tierney is offering support on the overlap.</p>

<p>It's no wonder Scott Parker is animated on the touchline. </p>

<p>Rob Draper at Craven Cottage: You can’t really make mistakes like that in the first ten minutes of your new Premier League season. Life is going to be difficult enough as it is for Fulham. Gifting Arsenal a 1-0 lead in an inauspicious sign</p>

<p>What did I just say about Fulham starting well? The commentator's curse in action.</p>

<p>Arsenal take the lead and it's a first goal of the season for Lacazette, who was poaching there and got his reward.</p>

<p>It began when Odoi wasn't able to cut out a hopeful diagonal ball into the Fulham box and Aubameyang gathered near the byline. He crossed low and Xhaka then Willian initially tried to turn it home, but saw their efforts blocked by Rodak.</p>

<p>The ball popped out to Lacazette, only a yard or two out, and he saw it home.</p>

<p>A quick VAR check for an offside during the build-up but it will count and Arsenal are on their way.</p>

<p>Fulham have started really brightly here. Denis Odoi moves the ball out the defence quickly and as Arsenal's defenders back off, he decides to just try his look. A 20-yard effort that Leno gathers at the second attempt.</p>

<p>Gabriel Magalhaes getting himself up to speed with the pace of the Premier League. He is penalised for a shove in the back during the opening minutes. </p>

<p>Oh dear, that could have been the worst possible start to the league season for Arsenal. A sloppy pass by Ainsley Maitland-Niles back to his keeper Bernd Leno and Aboubakar Kamara was alert to steal in and nick the ball.</p>

<p>It took good reactions from the keeper to pinch the ball back off him but a warning shot for the Gunners. They need to be alert at the back. </p>

<p>We're up and running with Fulham getting the game started. </p>

<p>They are in their familiar white and black home colours here. Arsenal in their change strip of all blue today. </p>

<p>The players take a knee and the Premier League season is officially underway now. </p>

<p>It's just 39 days since Fulham defeated their rivals Brentford in the Championship play-off final at Wembley. What a swift turnaround it will have been for Scott Parker and his team.</p>

<p>Arsenal have enjoyed a little longer off but not by much. They contested the FA Cup final, of course, and returned a couple of weeks ago for the Community Shield. Both were victories as the positivity brought by Mikel Arteta continues. </p>

<p>We're almost set for kick-off at Craven Cottage as Arsenal make their way onto the field closely - but not too closely in this Covid age - followed by their hosts, Fulham.</p>

<p>It's a slightly overcast afternoon in west London, down by the Thames, but nice and warm. </p>

<p>Craven Cottage without fans, of course, this afternoon and we can only hope the spectators are permitted to return soon to enjoy another Premier League campaign. </p>

<p>An interesting moment during the rondo in Arsenal's warm up there. It looked like Dani Ceballos went in a little hard on Eddie Nketiah and there were some handbags afterwards,</p>

<p>Passion? </p>

<p>Nketiah should’ve one banged him pic.twitter.com/PzISKvPkaM</p>

<p>We're just a matter of moments away now from the start of the 2020-21 Premier League season. </p>

<p>Here's a reminder of the two starting line-ups ahead of Fulham vs Arsenal. </p>

<p>Fulham: Rodak, Odoi, Hector, Ream, Bryan, Reed, Cairney, Kebano, Onomah, Cavaleiro, Kamara </p>

<p>Arsenal: Leno, Holding, Magalhaes, Tierney, Bellerin, Elneny, Xhaka, Maitland-Niles, Willian, Lacazette, Aubameyang  </p>

<p>Barely a week traipses by without the debate around Mesut Ozil's role at Arsenal rearing its head in some form.</p>

<p>The debate has been roaring on ever since he put pen to paper on a brand new three-and-a-half-year contract worth £350,000 a week in January 2018, and his performances since then have not justify his hefty salary.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 31-year-old German took part in a Q&amp;A on his personal Twitter account and declared that he was 'fit and ready' to go against Fulham in Arsenal's first game of the new Premier League season.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta admits his own experience does not provide the finest example but expects Willian to make a long-term contribution at Arsenal.</p>

<p>The three-year deal signed by the 32-year-old Brazilian is a culture shift at a club where the policy for many years under Arsene Wenger was to offer players over 30 deals of no more than 12 months.</p>

<p>‘Don’t compare him to me, I am a bad example,’ said Arteta, who retired at the age of 34 and barely played in the Premier League during the final 18 months of his career.</p>

<p>'We need to get Arsenal back as a Champions League club. That's where this club belongs in my opinion. That has to be the ambition.'</p>

<p>On Thursday, Vinai Venkatesham - Arsenal's new chief executive - highlighted in no uncertain terms what the club's target should be ahead of the new season as they enter a fourth campaign outside of Europe's elite competition.</p>

<p>Arsenal's approach to matters both on and off the field have swung from sensible to the bizarre since their last Champions League appearance, which ended in humiliation with a 10-2 aggregate scoreline against Bayern Munich in 2017.</p>

<p>Arsenal are looking to win on MD1 in consecutive seasons for the first time since 2009-10 (three in a row), while Fulham have lost their opening day game in each of their last two seasons, 0-2 to Crystal Palace in 2018-19 and 0-1 to Barnsley last term.</p>

<p>Arsenal are facing a newly-promoted side on MD1 of a Premier League season for a fifth time, losing none of their previous four (W3 D1). Their last league defeat against a promoted side on opening day was back in 1976-77, losing 0-1 at Highbury to Bristol City.</p>

<p>Fulham have lost their last 10 top-flight London derbies - losing all 10 in the 2018/19 season - the longest ever run by a club in top-flight history.</p>

<p>When it comes to English football, the Premier League is the place to be. Whether it be the increased quality, the larger crowds, the financial reward or the prestige of the league, every club longs for a place in the top-flight.</p>

<p>But of those who are lucky enough to make it into the top division, just over half survive their first season in the Premier League. More often than not, teams do the hard work to achieve promotion but struggle to find their form on the big stage. </p>

<p>This year, Fulham, West Bromwich Albion and Leeds United will try their luck, but do they have what it takes to last the Premier League's survival of the fittest?</p>

<p>With no sign of supporters being allowed back into stadiums for the foreseeable, today's four Premier League games will all be televised and that means the kick-off times are staggered.</p>

<p>12.30pm - Fulham vs Arsenal</p>

<p>3pm - Crystal Palace vs Southampton</p>

<p>5.30pm - Liverpool vs Leicester City</p>

<p>8pm - West Ham United vs Newcastle United</p>
