        <p>Demi Lovato ended her engagement to Max Ehrich last week, after just six months together, and two as an engaged couple. </p>

<p>And the former Disney star, 28, is 'completely embarrassed' be her ex's actions, a source told E! News on Monday. </p>

<p>Since the split, the soap actor, 29, has been public about his version of their split, alleging he learned of it 'through the tabloids,' and that she is allowing fans to 'bully' him. </p>

<p>Embarrassed: Demi Lovato is 'completely embarrassed' be her ex Max Ehrich's actions, a source told E! News on Monday, and that she 'wants nothing to do with him,' after he has been incredibly public about their split and claims against her</p>

<p>'Demi wants no contact with Max at this point,' the source said. 'She is completely embarrassed at the way he's been acting and putting their relationship on blast via social media.' </p>

<p>Adding that despite Max's attempts to 'reach out,' and 'denial' that their relationship is over, the Sorry Not Sorry hitmaker 'wants nothing to do with him.' </p>

<p>Demi has been posting selfies and photos spending time with family and friends since their split was reported on Thursday.  </p>

<p>Though the source claimed the actor was attempting to contact Demi privately, Max took to his Instagram Stories again on Monday to speak out about their split. </p>

<p>'One chapter finally closed this AM,' he wrote. 'And now I turn the page.' </p>

<p>Single Demi: 'Demi wants no contact with Max at this point,' the source said. 'She is completely embarrassed at the way he's been acting and putting their relationship on blast via social media.' She has been posting selfies, and videos with friends and family since the split</p>

<p>Closed chapter: Though the source claimed the actor was attempting to contact Demi privately, Max took to his Instagram Stories again on Monday to speak out about their split. 'One chapter finally closed this AM,' he wrote. 'And now I turn the page. </p>

<p>'Focused on wellness, love, God, my family, friends and my art,' he added. 'Good vibes only.' </p>

<p>The outlet also reported that Ehrich said 'Please stop trying to thank you, next... Me,' a reference to Ariana Grande's hit song, that was released just after her short-lived engagement to Pete Davidson, in which she happily moved on from her exes. </p>

<p>His posts came after other Instagram Stories he made on Saturday claiming he found out about their split in the tabloids. </p>

<p>A source told People on Saturday that Demi, made Max 'aware that the relationship was over and it was going to come out in the press.'  </p>

<p>Not over? The actor posted a stream of Instagram Stories, on Sunday which he deleted, in which he claimed the former couple have not spoken and 'haven't even officially ended anything to each other'</p>

<p>'Up to this moment we haven't spoken over the phone... we haven't even officially ended anything to each other,' Max wrote on Sunday. 'Literally. I'm here in real time with y'all. I love Demetria and just want her to be healthy and safe.'</p>

<p>He wrote in another Story: 'If you're reading this ... I love you always.... unconditionally... not matter what,' and then included grabs of some of Demi's hit songs and encouraged people to listen, praising her voice, and tellings fans she 'deserves' a Grammy.</p>

<p>'Imagine finding out to the status of your relationship through a tabloid,' he wrote. 'While your [sic] in the middle of filming a biopic movie about a Pastor in a Christian Church whose intention of the film is to help people'</p>

<p>A source later told E! News that he was 'lying' about the tabloid claims and knew of their split before it became public.  </p>

<p>Ouch: His posts came after other Instagram Stories he made on Saturday claiming he found out about their split in the tabloids, though a source later told E! that he was 'lying'</p>

<p>A source told PEOPLE, however, that Demi did tell Max their relationship was over before it was reported.</p>

<p>'Demi made Max aware that the relationship was over and it was going to come out in the press.' they told the publication.</p>

<p>News of the couple's split came on Thursday amid rumors that max had sent 'thirsty' messaged to Selena Gomez. Demi also allegedly didn't trust Max's intentions and thinks he proposed for attention.</p>

<p>Max signed off his Instagram posts on Saturday writing, 'God bless,'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Demi shared her first Instagram without her engagement ring on Friday.</p>

<p>The singer, split with Max after finding out he once sent obsessive and 'thirsty' messages to Demi's former BFF Selena Gomez back in 2015.</p>

<p>Demi took to the social media platform hours after the news broke to share a video of herself with her glam squad, wearing a T-shirt with the words 'dogs over people' splashed across the chest, hinting at her current feelings towards her ex.</p>

<p>Personal troubles: The 29-year-old actor followed up with two more posts revealing he's on set of a new movie</p>

<p>Ringless: On Friday Demi shared her first Instagram post since the split - without her engagement ring</p>

<p>There are also reports the singer believes her ex 'proposed for attention' and that she 'ignored many red flags' </p>

<p>One source said: 'She didn't know who Max truly was and didn't think he had good intentions... There were many red flags she was ignoring and trying to turn a blind eye to.'</p>

<p>Whilst another insider added: 'She doesn't trust him and thinks he's sketchy... She feels he proposed to get attention.'</p>

<p>A third source explained: 'Things started going downhill [when he said he was flying out to Atlanta for work]. They were arguing a lot and Demi didn't want him to go without her... There has been a lot of tension and Demi left him to get a clear head.' </p>

<p>'Dogs over people': Demi took to the social media platform hours after the news broke to share a video of herself with her glam squad, wearing a T-shirt with the words 'dogs over people' splashed across the chest, hinting at her current feelings</p>

<p>However, Demi is said to be 'distraught' over the split.</p>

<p>A source told E! News: 'She really loved him and wanted it to work. Demi is really upset and distraught about it.'</p>

<p>A source told People on Thursday: 'It was a tough decision, but Demi and Max have decided to go their separate ways to focus on their respective careers.' </p>

<p>They added: 'They have respect and love for one another and will always cherish the time they spent together.' </p>

<p>News that there was trouble in the relationship camera earlier in the day when another source told Page Six: 'It's not over yet..., But it's on its way there.'</p>

<p>The outlet reported that Demi's bodyguard and sister unfollowed Max on Instagram, with the couple not engaging in like or comments on each others recent social media posts. </p>

<p>Rocky: The singer, 28, and the American actor, 29, have called time on their relationship, after facing rumours earlier this month that Max, once sent 'thirsty messages' to Demi's former BFF Selena Gomez back in 2015</p>

<p>Demi and Max have had a whirlwind romance, that started in March just before the coronavirus pandemic began. </p>

<p>And sources later revealed that they had decided to quarantine together at Demi's house amid the lockdown.  </p>

<p>Demi and the former soap opera actor quickly began boasting about their love on social media.  </p>

<p>They announced their engagement in July, alongside a beachside photoshoot showing off Demi's shining diamond ring.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Demi admitted they were considering eloping amid the pandemic limiting large gatherings to 10 people.</p>

<p>The singer shared that she wants their wedding to be 'sacred' between them, as she dished to Popcrush Nights.</p>

<p>Social clues: Demi's bodyguard and sister unfollowed Max on Instagram, with the couple not engaging in like or comments on each others recent social media posts</p>

<p>Seeming torn between a big wedding and eloping she said 'On one hand, I would love to elope because my life is so public and I want to keep it sacred between me and him. </p>

<p>Adding: 'On the other hand, I want my friends and family to be there for a celebration. But I can't do that until the pandemic's over because it's not safe.'  </p>

<p>In a separate post on Monday, he went on to explain that articles referencing his Facebook page were 'fake news.' </p>

<p>'I don't post on Facebook or Twitter,' he wrote. </p>

<p>Twitter seems to have been a sensitive subject for the couple towards the end of their relationship, after Tweets, videos and Instagram Live videos of Ehrich professing his love for Selena Gomez resurfaced online. </p>

<p>Fans claimed to have screenshots of tweets and other social media posts by Max pitting Demi and her former BFF Selena Gomez, against each other. </p>

<p>Real or fake? More posts have emerged this week showing Max's alleged obsession with Selena Gomez</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fan boy: In this screenshot Max wrote 'MARRY ME NOW' on a live broadcast from Selena</p>

<p>Admiration: It also appears that Max has a similar tattoo to the singer</p>

<p>Demi took to Instagram earlier this month to seemingly debunk a slew of viral screenshots that showed rude tweets made by Max, in 2015.  </p>

<p>'It's really sad when people FAKE images to put women against each other. If women have conflict that's between them NOT YOU,' the former Disney star wrote. </p>

<p>In the tweets, Max allegedly wrote that Lovato's former best friend Selena  was 'prettier' and more vocally gifted that her.</p>

<p>And this week, following the split, more posts have emerged where Max appeared to write to Selena 'Marry me now' during live broadcasts.</p>

<p>He is also said to have got a matching tattoo, just like the one of a musical note on Selena's wrist.</p>

<p>There is a blog dedicated to uncovering max's alleged past posts about his love for Selena. He is also accused of setting up fake profile about him and Selena being the 'perfect couple'.</p>

<p>Whirlwind: Demi and Max have had a whirlwind romance, that started in March just before the coronavirus pandemic began, and announced their engagement in July</p>

<p>Covid wedding: Earlier this month, Demi admitted they were considering eloping amid the pandemic limiting large gatherings to 10 people </p>

<p>Before their split, when rumors of Max's obsession first emerged, Demi passionately challenge the validity of the past tweets and she went as far as to urge 'tabloids' to write about 'more important sh*t.'  </p>

<p>Selena is, clearly, a touchy subject for Demi, being that the pair have endured a rocky friendship since rising to fame on Disney Channel in the mid-2000s.</p>

<p>Lovato opened up about their crumbling friendship in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in May.'When you grow up with somebody, you're always going to have love for them. But I'm not friends with her, so it felt….I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best,' she explained.  </p>
