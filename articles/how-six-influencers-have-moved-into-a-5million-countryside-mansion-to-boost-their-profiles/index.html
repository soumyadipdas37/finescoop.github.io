    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>TikTok has rapidly become one of the most popular forms of social media for Gen Z, but this group of influencers have taken their love for the platform one step further.  </p>

<p>Six social media influencers in their early 20s who have dubbed themselves 'The Wave House', have moved into a £5million mansion in the British countryside,on the outskirts of London, where they will live together and create videos for the platform. </p>

<p>At the start of this month, the first video on the collective's TikTok account appeared, promoting the influencers new luxury digs which includes 13-acres of land, a swimming pool, gym, spa and a 100-inch TV which cost almost £30,000. </p>

<p>But the new group, designed to help the influencers gain popularity and formed by management agency, Yoke, who cover the costs of the house and treat the mansion as an 'office', baffled social media users, who compared them to a 'cult'.</p>

<p>Mansions where content creators live together gained popularity thanks to the The Hype House, a collective of TikTok personalities based in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>The US collective was formed in December 2019 and is made up of rising or established Gen Z influencers, including Addison Rae, 19, who is a friend of Kourtney Kardashian.</p>

<p>The first member of the Wave House was London-based influencer Eloise , 22, (pictured) who rose to fame making TikTok videos, and now boasts 2.4million followers and 62.7million likes on the platform</p>

<p>Elisabeth, 20, from London (pictured middle) rose to fame through her YouTube account, and describes herself on her Instagram bio as 'CEO of boarding school'</p>

<p>Vlogger Millie T, 20, from London, (pictured) was next to join the house, and boasts 1.2million subscribers on YouTube and has racked up a staggering 84.8million views across her channel</p>

<p>But now it seems British influencers are jumping on the trend, with Spencer Elmer, Eloise Fouladgar, Jimbo H, Millie T, Kate Elisabeth and Carmie Sellitto all of whom are 20-24 and from London, starting their own social media haven. </p>

<p>Wave House clips feature influencers riding into their front garden on a helicopter, sat on a throne holding a Burmese python, and bursting their head through a print of the Mona Lisa.    </p>

<p>If that wasn't enough, the house also includes a dog bathroom inside the spa and a library, according to the Wave House's 'presenter' - another TikTok user called Bobby Moore. </p>

<p>The influencers belong to management agency, Yoke, who cover the costs of the house and treat the mansion as an 'office' for their influencers to create content in - but the TikTok stars are under no contractual obligation to stay in the house.   </p>

<p>'The whole idea is a place of work, but they do live there. The costs are all covered by the company, if they want to go home, they can', Ercan Boyraz, head of influencer management at Yoke told FEMAIL.   </p>

<p>Six social media influencers (pictured)who have dubbed themselves 'The Wave House', have moved into a £5million mansion in the British countryside</p>

<p> The members of the house revealed their identities in a series of bizarre videos in which they reveal the content creator by taking off the spiked masks covering their entire face. Pictured, the influencers with their masks on </p>

<p>'In terms of ourselves Yoke,' he told 'We're essentially an influencer network and the whole aim of the house was professionalising TikTok and creating a professional environment for them to create content.' </p>

<p>But unlike a normal office environment, the Wave House is a place for influencers to perfect their 'craft' and help monetise their videos . </p>

<p>'The whole structure is you go away and you live there and focus on your craft and professionalise what you’re doing', Boyraz went on.  </p>

<p>Social media marketing agencies usually require a cut of the influencer's profit, or a set fee for a space in their agency. </p>

<p>The £5 million mansion includes 13-acres of land, a swimming pool, gym, spa and a 100-inch TV which cost almost £30,000</p>

<p>Pictured, The Hype House, a collective of TikTok personalities based in Los Angeles, California which was formed in December last year </p>

<p>The members of the house revealed their identities in a series of bizarre videos in which they reveal the content creator by taking off the spiked masks covering their entire face. </p>

<p>The house's TikTok account has racked up 2.3million followers and 18.1million likes, while their Instagram has already garnered 70k followers.    </p>

<p>But despite their large following, social media users have seemed less than impressed with the new collective, with some calling them 'a meme'. </p>

<p>'Does anybody even know the people in the "Wave House" they're acting like they're so famous in their house reveal and nobody who matters even knows who tf they are', wrote one Twitter user.   </p>

<p>Despite their large following, social media users have seemed less than impressed with the new collective, with some calling them 'a meme'</p>

<p>'The wave house is just rich people that said 'hey no one knows who we are but f**k it lets make a TikTok house', wrote another. </p>

<p>'Wait did any of you guys know who the members of The Wave House were before they became a meme?', asked a third.  </p>

<p>YouTuber Spencer previously collaborated with ASOS to launch their Collusion line, while Millie is an aspiring singer who has released just two singles so far on Spotify. </p>

<p>Couple Eloise and Jimbo both rose to fame by sharing videos on their TikTok accounts, and often share Instagram posts jetting around the world together to locations such as Bali and Croatia. </p>

<p>The couple are reportedly on track to make £120,000 a year through their videos. </p>

<p>Kate rose to fame through her YouTube account, and describes herself on her Instagram bio as 'CEO of boarding school', while her boyfriend Carmie, also gained popularity through YouTube.   </p>

<p>Mansions where content creators live together gained popularity thanks to the The Hype House, a collective of TikTok personalities based in Los Angeles, California. Pictured, the inside of The Wave House </p>

<p>The house includes an indoor swimming pool, dog bathroom inside the spa and a library inside the house</p>

<p>The collective post bizarre TikTok videos and revealed each member's identity with videos taking off large masks covering their entire faces. Pictured, Eloise Fouladgar, 20, from London</p>

<p>The clip racked up 4.3million likes and over 78K comments, with the majority of users still confused as to who exactly the influencer was</p>

<p>One of the group's most famous videos was Eloise's identity reveal, which featured the 20-year-old wearing a skin-tight silver sparkly mini-dress in a bath full of milk and rose petals, as other masked members of the group poured milk into the tub. </p>

<p>The clip racked up 4.3million likes and over 78K comments, with the majority of users still confused as to who exactly the influencer was. </p>

<p>'Yes we still don't know you're name', wrote one, while another said: 'never seen her on my fyp' (for you page). </p>

<p>However one member, Carmie, hit headlines last year after accusing makeup blogger James Charles of trying to seduce him with flirty texts, and questioned his sexuality.</p>

<p>However one member, Carmie (right), hit headlines last year after accusing makeup blogger James Charles (left) of trying to seduce him with flirty texts, and questioned his sexuality </p>

<p>The British YouTuber met Charles at VidCon, a four-day event in July 2019 and described how Charles questioned Sellitto's sexuality when Sellitto told him he wasn’t gay.</p>

<p>Sellitto told DailyMail.com: 'A few days later he started contacting me via social media. He was flirty but didn't say anything inappropriate. He kept telling me how I was the hottest guy he ever laid his eyes on.</p>

<p>‘A few days after we met I had to fly back to London. We stayed in contact for the next week or so, then I told him I didn’t want to lead him on. I told him I wasn’t gay.</p>

<p>‘But James made me question myself. He asked me, "Are you sure you aren’t gay or bi? Are you sure?" I finally had to tell him again that I didn’t want to lead him on. I guess the bottom line is I wasn’t as interested in him as he was in me.'</p>

<p>Eloise Fouladgar, 22, London</p>

<p>The first member of the Wave House was London-based influencer Eloise who rose to fame making TikTok videos</p>

<p>Eloise is dating fellow influencer and Wave House member Jimbo (pictured) and share Instagram posts jetting around the world </p>

<p>Eloise is dating fellow influencer and Wave House member Jimbo, and often shares videos and pictures on social media of the couple jetting around the world to locations such as Bali and Croatia. </p>

<p>The content creator, who studied politics at London’s City University, often shares videos with Jimbo, dancing to the latest songs trending on the platform and takes part in viral challenges with her boyfriend. </p>

<p>Jimbo H, 21, London</p>

<p>Social media influencer Jimbo boasts 1.2million followers and 26.8million likes on TikTok</p>

<p>He is now reportedly on track to make £120,000 a year making videos with Eloise after the couple met on tinder in 2018</p>
