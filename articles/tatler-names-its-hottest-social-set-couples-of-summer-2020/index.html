        <p>Society bible Tatler has unveiled its hottest couples from the Social Set this summer, including royal pairings, chocolate heiresses and modelling socialites.</p>

<p>While some couples have stepped out in public for the first time by taking lavish trips across the continent, others cemented long-standing commitments by staying at one another's family piles during lockdown.</p>

<p>Royals including Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and her new beau Hon. Peregine Pearson were declared 'the hottest new pairing of the summer', while Talita von Furstenberg and her boyfriend Rocco Brignon are described as 'getting serious' during lockdown. </p>

<p>Other blue-blooded couples on the list include Princess Margaret’s grandson Arthur Chatto and university girlfriend Lizzie Friend, as well as Jemima Cadbury, the great-great-great-granddaughter of confectioner John Cadbury, and her beau David Tollemache, the nephew of Lord Tollemache. </p>

<p>Here, FEMAIL reveals the hottest couples to have emerged out of lockdown after a summer of love...  </p>

<p>Jemima Cadbury and David Tollemache</p>

<p>Society bible Tatler has unveiled its hottest couples from the Social Set this summer, including royal pairings, chocolate heiresses and modelling socialites (pictured, Jemima Cadbury and her Old Etonian beau David Tollemache) </p>

<p>The great-great-great-granddaughter of confectioner John Cadbury has been dating David Tollemache, the nephew of Lord Tollemache, since 2016.</p>

<p>The couple regularly share snaps of their adventures around the world on Instagram, visiting snowy Amsterdam in January and St Barth last August.  </p>

<p>The quirky socialite and chocolate dynasty scion Jemima is part of the Chelsea social set, living just off Sloane Square.</p>

<p>David and Jemima recently celebrated her birthday at the neighbourhood's new hotspot, Stanley's, with the heiress affectionately calling her boyfriend 'Tolly.'</p>

<p>The blue blooded couple have been together for several years, and often share snaps of their adventures on Instagram (pictured left, in Amsterdam and right, at a wedding)</p>

<p>She launched lifestyle website Bee Bazaar was launched in May 2018, revealing: 'The site connects people with the fun things happening in London. Things that I and my friends would want to do — something cultural and artistic.</p>

<p>‘So many of my friends have companies and exhibitions and launches that you never hear about. I got the website up and running to connect young people to cool brands.’ </p>

<p>Meanwhile David's relatives Lord and Lady Tollemache live close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the ancient, vast and moated Helmingham Hall, where the Queen is a regular overnight guest.</p>

<p>Their two sons are both true Turnip Toffs: banker Edward, Prince Charles’s godson, and his wife, Sophie, have two young sons; and fund manager James, who was at Eton with William, is married to Princess Florrie von Preussen (of Prussia), who used to style for Oka, the upmarket interiors label owned by Samantha Cameron’s mother.    </p>

<p>Lady Amelia Spencer and Greg Mallett </p>

<p>Lady Amelia Spencer, 38, who is the daughter of Earl Spencer and first cousin of Princes William and Harry, and her long-term boyfriend Greg Mallett recently announced their engagement </p>

<p>Princess Diana's niece Lady Amelia Spencer also makes the list of hottest couples, having recently gotten engaged to long-term boyfriend Greg Mallett following a romantic proposal in South Africa.</p>

<p>The society beauty, 28, who is the daughter of Earl Spencer and first cousin of Princes William and Harry, met her real estate beau while they were both studying at the University of Cape Town.</p>

<p>In July, Greg, 30, posted on Instagram that he'd popped the question to his girlfriend of 11 years, sharing sweet photos of them both from Clouds Wine &amp; Guest Estate in Stellenbosch.  </p>

<p>Lady Amelia, whose first name is actually Katya, her twin sister Eliza grew up in the Constantia area of Cape Town with siblings Kitty and Louis. </p>

<p>The society beauty met her real estate beau while they were both studying at the University of Cape Town. Pictured after getting engaged</p>

<p>Greg is well-known by the Spencer clan and is already considered to be part of the family. Pictured in the shots he shared with Amelia to mark their engagement</p>

<p>The three sisters attended the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey in 2011. </p>

<p>While Lady Kitty, Louis and Lady Eliza were present at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's nuptials in May 2018, Amelia was missing.  </p>

<p>Amelia is the latest Spencer sister to get engaged, after it was reported earlier this year that Lady Kitty is engaged to her 60-year-old beau, multi-millionaire Michael Lewis. </p>

<p>Greg is well-known by the Spencer clan and is already considered to be part of the family. </p>

<p>Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Hon. Peregrine Pearson</p>

<p>Tatler describes Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece, 23, and  Peregrine Pearson, 25, as 'the hottest new pairing of the summer' </p>

<p>Tatler describes the couple as 'possibly the hottest new pairing of the summer' with Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece stepping out with English aristocrat, Hon. Peregrine Pearson (Perry to his friends), the son of Viscount Cowdray.  </p>

<p>The couple spent some time with her family in Greece earlier this month while visiting her grandparents, King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie, with the Princess posting a sweet picture of them driving a moped around the coastline.</p>

<p>Peregrine Pearson is the 25-year-old son and heir of the 4th Viscount Cowdray, whose family has a reputed £224 million ($292.55 million) fortune.</p>

<p>Love is in the air: She has spent her summer holidays relaxing with Peregrine Pearson, the 25-year-old son and heir of the 4th Viscount Cowdray</p>

<p>'Things are getting very serious,' a friend told The Daily Mail's Richard Eden. 'He's already met the family and they love him.'  </p>

<p>Perry's father owns a significant chunk of the Pearson media empire as well as the 16,500-acre West Sussex estate which is home to Cowdray Park polo club, where Princes William and Harry have played.</p>

<p>Arthur Chatto and Lizzie Friend</p>

<p>Princess Margaret’s grandson has been with his university girlfriend Lizzie Friend for two years.</p>

<p>Despite his hoards of young fans the Queen's former page boy went Instagram official with Lizzie for the first time in September 2018.</p>

<p>Princess Margaret’s grandson Arthur Chatto, 21, has been with his university girlfriend Lizzie Friend for two years after meeting while studying together at Edinburgh</p>

<p>The son of Lady Sarah Chatto, who is 23rd in line to the throne, posted a loved up snap of Lizzie perched on his knee with an arm slung around his shoulder.</p>

<p>Lizzie is a fellow Edinburgh University student, where Arthur is studying Geography, and a source previously told the Daily Mail: 'They hit it off straight away.</p>

<p>'She's really sweet and they make a very nice couple. He took her to Royal Ascot this summer as his date.'</p>

<p>She recently greeted him alongside Lady Sarah and his elder brother Samuel after he took part in the GB Row Challenge.  </p>

<p>Ella Ross and the Marquess of Granby</p>

<p>Society beauty Ella Ross, 24, and Marquess of Granby, 20, spent lockdown together at his family pile of Belvoir Castle </p>

<p>Society beauty Ella Ross, 24, and Marquess of Granby, 20, were also among the couples named the hottest from the set this summer.</p>

<p>The couple, who celebrated their one-year anniversary earlier this spring, have continued to grow closer after the model stayed with Charles and his family at the Duchess of Rutland’s Belvoir Castle estate during lockdown. </p>

<p>She stayed on the estate with boyfriend Charles, his parents and his four siblings. </p>

<p>In May, the Duchess has given a very public seal of approval to model Ella, by selecting her to star in the campaign for her new nightwear collection.  </p>

<p>The couple started dating last year after her split from Scott Disick, a star of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. </p>

<p>Talita von Furstenberg and Rocco Brignone</p>

<p>Talita and boyfriend Rocco Brignone, 19, recently enjoyed a romantic getaway in Europe, travelling to the south of France before driving down to Portofino (pictured)</p>

<p>Olympia's cousin heiress Talita von Furstenberg, 21, has also been living it up abroad with her boyfriend Rocco Brignone, 19.  </p>

<p>Having been raised in Los Angeles, Talita relocated to the East Coast in 2017, when she started attending Georgetown alongside her cousin, fellow royal Prince Alexios of Greece.</p>

<p>She and boyfriend Rocco were living in New York, where Talita is set to begin her final year at NYU, at the onset of the pandemic, and moved back to Malibu to stay with her parents.</p>

<p>The couple recently enjoyed a romantic getaway in Europe, travelling to the south of France before driving down to Portofino.</p>

<p>Talita recently told FEMAIL that travelling through Europe with her beau has made them 'a lot closer and a lot more serious'</p>

<p>Despite dating for several years, Tatler reports the couple 'started to get serious' this summer, spending their holiday driving across the continent.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Talita told FEMAIL that being together 24-7 in lockdown has been 'challenging', but has also made them stronger.</p>

<p>'It's been fun for us, it's definitely made us a lot closer and a lot more serious since we've literally been 24-7 together,' she said - adding that wedding bells are 'in the very distant future' for the young couple.</p>

<p>Padmanabh, or Pacho to friends is worth an estimated £500-£650 million and was crowned as the unofficial Maharajah of Jaipur in 2011.</p>

<p>He is a member of the former ruling family of Jaipur State, in present-day Rajasthan, India. </p>

<p>It is believed Pacho, who was named in Tatler's most eligible bachelor's list just last year, has been dating Claire for just over a year.</p>

<p>He has strong connections to the UK, having attended Millfield School in Somerset before returning frequently for polo matches.   </p>

<p>Irene Forte and Felix Winckler</p>

<p>Like Ella Ross and Marquess of Granby, Irene Forte, 31, and tech whizz Felix Winckler, 40, had their commitment solidified by spending lockdown with their in-laws after getting engaged in January of this year </p>

<p>Like Ella Ross and Marquess of Granby, Irene Forte, 31, and tech whizz Felix Winckler, 40, had their commitment solidified by spending lockdown with their in-laws. </p>

<p>After getting engaged in January, the duo holed up at Irene's family pile of Rye House Farm in Ripley.</p>

<p>Irene and Felix were joined on the 1,800 acre estate by  her parents Sir Rocco and Aliai, newly-wed sister Lavita, brother-in-law Dimitri Chandris, nephew 14-month-old Johnny, brother Charles and his girlfriend Georgie.</p>

<p>The Oxford BA French and Italian graduate is Wellness Director at her family's $440 million empire and oversees the spa programs across all 14 of the luxury Rocco Forte Hotel properties. </p>

<p>Alexa Chung and Orson Fry</p>

<p>Alexa Chung, 36, and chocolate scion Orson Fry, 24, have also found love with one another after being introduced by mutual friends </p>

<p>He was described as a 'mystery hunk' when he was spotted kissing Alexa Chung, 36, at a pop festival last summer.</p>

<p>But now chocolate scion Orson Fry, 24, and model and It girl Alexa are rarely spotted without one another. </p>

<p>The pair were introduced by mutual friends and are said to be 'besotted' with one another. </p>

<p>The duo spent lockdown in East London, where they have kept a low profile throughout the summer.    </p>
