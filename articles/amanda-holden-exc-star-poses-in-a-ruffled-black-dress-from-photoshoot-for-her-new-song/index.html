        <p>Amanda Holden posed for a photoshoot for her new track, With You, dedicated to her stillborn son Theo.</p>

<p>In images exclusively obtained by MailOnline, the Heart FM host, 49, stunned in a ruffled black dress as she took images in the woods to promote her album Songs From My Heart, set for release on Friday. </p>

<p>The presenter shed light on the message behind her single, admitting her late child's death in 2011 'changed her as a person' and credited her husband Chris Hughes for 'staying strong' when she 'fell apart'.</p>

<p>'It changes you': Amanda Holden posed for a photoshoot for her new track, With You, dedicated to her stillborn son Theo</p>

<p>The media personality said: 'The last lines of this song are ''You took my life with you, Took my world with you'' and so this is for Theo, our baby who was born sleeping and for Chris who stayed strong when I fell apart. </p>

<p>'It was Chris who told me he always thought of Theo when he heard this song which floored me so it's also his song for Theo. </p>

<p>'It's very emotional to sing this song but I think you get chosen for experiences like that only if you are strong enough to deal with it. And it changes you as a person. It is also Simon Cowell's favourite song.'</p>

<p>The mother-of-two was first inspired to record an album after she and her daughters Lexi, 14, and Hollie, eight, recorded a cover of The Greatest Showman hit Tightrope for her husband Chris Hughes to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. </p>

<p>Powerful: In images exclusively obtained by MailOnline, the Heart FM host, 49, stunned in a ruffled black dress as she took images in the woods to</p>

<p>Candid: The presenter shed light on the message behind her single, admitting her late child's death in 2011 'changed her as a person'</p>

<p>Commanding attention: The former Wild At Heart actress caught the eye in the extravagant ensemble</p>

<p>Family first: The broadcaster and her husband Chris Hughes are parents to daughters Lexi, 14, and Hollie, eight (pictured this summer)</p>

<p>In July, Amanda spoke candidly about the devastating moment she learned there was no heartbeat when she was pregnant with her baby son.</p>

<p>Speaking on BBC's Dear NHS Superstars special, the TV star explained she chose to have a C-section and initially thought she would not be able to hold her baby after he was born.</p>

<p>She said: 'I kept saying, "I can't hold a dead baby." I was absolutely terrified. Just as baby was going to come out my husband Chris had to leave the room, he couldn't bear it.</p>

<p>'Jackie [her midwife] wrapped him up and I said, "Jackie, I can't do it, I can't hold him." Jackie said, "he's absolutely gorgeous, you need to see him."</p>

<p>Exciting times ahead: The blonde's album Songs From My Heart is scheduled for release on Friday</p>

<p>'That's when I held him even though he was fast asleep. The one thing I remember is his perfectly formed eyebrows, which all my children have.'</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, the presenter took to social media to deny 'flashing her nipples' on Saturday's Britain's Got Talent after her gown sparked over 200 Ofcom complaints. </p>

<p>The broadcaster told her Instagram followers: 'Mmmm really?! Who has nipples this close to their cleavage?!</p>

<p>Backlash: Earlier in the week, the presenter took to social media to deny 'flashing her nipples' on Saturday's Britain's Got Talent after her gown sparked over 200 Ofcom complaints </p>

<p>'FYI. A boned corset dented the girls all night', she ended her post alongside a series of fried egg emojis.  </p>

<p>During the fourth semi-final, Amanda wowed in a showstopping metallic navy gown, but at the time some fans questioned if she had suffered a wardrobe malfunction after they claimed to 'see her nipples'.</p>

<p>According to a report from The Mirror on Monday, the regulator received 277 complaints about the programme, with the majority focusing on her ensemble which featured a plunging neckline.</p>

<p>Setting the record straight: The broadcaster told her Instagram followers: 'Mmmm really?! Who has nipples this close to their cleavage?!</p>

<p>Racy: The regulator is said to have received 277 complaints, with the majority focusing on her outfit which featured a plunging neckline and was boned to accentuate her cleavage</p>

<p>One wrote on social media: 'Is it me or Amanda's nipples nearly hanging out of her top?', while a second asked, 'Are Amanda's nipples on show?'</p>

<p>Another shared on Twitter, 'Just me, or does Amanda's dress make it look like her nipples are out?', before adding: 'To be clear... I'm not offended just commented on the obvious nipple shadow.'</p>

<p>Clearly shocked, one viewer wrote: 'Is it me or can you see Amanda's nipples?' </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Ofcom, as well as Amanda's representatives and a Britain's Got Talent spokesperson for comment. </p>

<p>Wardrobe malfunction: At the time, some fans claimed Amanda had suffered a nip slip in the look, and took to Twitter to question if they'd seen more than they'd bargained for</p>

<p>This is not the first time Amanda's ensembles have caused a stir, as last year her raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show.</p>

<p>Amanda made an impression in thigh-skimming gown by Ziad Nakad, showing off a liberal amount of leg thanks to the asymmetric hemline.</p>

<p>While the blonde beauty had also risked a wardrobe malfunction in a cut-out number by Jennifer Clair.</p>

<p>The stunning jewel hued frock featured a cut-out at the bust, threatening to expose her cleavage, as well as a high-high split running up her right leg.</p>

<p>Wow: Last year, Amanda's raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show</p>

<p>Stunning: Amanda (pictured left) first made an impression in a semi-sheer ensemble, while she also risked a wardrobe malfunction when she dared to bare in a cut-out number</p>

<p>She then dared to bare in the revealing, spider web number which attracted the Ofcom complaints.</p>

<p>While the next night she revealed her ample cleavage in a plunging, midnight blue gown, adorned with white floral detail and sequins. </p>

<p>Despite the controversy over her looks, Amanda told You magazine at the time that she was delighted her remarkable figure still attracts attention: 'I love it that people are still talking about my tired old breasts and I'm nearly 50!'</p>

<p>She added: 'No one talks about [BGT co-host] Alesha Dixon's – she's got great boobs by the way – and she's eight years younger than me.</p>

<p>Semi-sheer: Amanda also dared to bare in the revealing, spider web number (pictured) which attracted a number of Ofcom complaints</p>

<p>Revealing: Amanda (pictured left) also wore a plunging black gown and she flashed her long legs in a mini-dress  (pictured right)</p>

<p>'Age is totally irrelevant, thanks to people like J-Lo, who is 49 and just a sexy, hot woman who dresses for how she feels.'</p>

<p>Amanda's wardrobe has led to some controversial moments in the past after a daring Julien Macdonald gown she wore during the semi-final of BGT three years ago attracted a staggering 663 Ofcom complaints. </p>

<p>Ofcom said that while it recognised the dress 'had potential to offend some viewers during what is a family show' - the outfit 'would not have exceeded most viewers' expectations'.</p>

<p>And this wasn't the first time risque outfit choices on Britain's Got Talent caused fans to lodge official complaints.</p>

<p>In 2016, Ofcom again decided not to investigate the ITV show after outfits worn by Holden and fellow judge Alesha Dixon sparked 90 complaints from viewers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Diversity's Black Lives Matter inspired performance during the show's first semi-final attracted 24,500 complaints to Ofcom, who have since announced they will not investigate any further.</p>

<p>ITV has 'stood with Diversity' as they featured adverts in national newspapers in support of the controversial dance. </p>

<p>ITV are believed to have spent around £260,000 on the newspaper ads with full-page monochrome pieces in The Metro costing £36,461 and £27,700 in The Mirror. </p>

<p>Controversy: Meanwhile, Diversity's dance earlier this month sparked 24,500 complaints but  Ofcom have since announced they will not investigate any further</p>

<p>Alesha was one of many who praised ITV for standing by the dance troupe. The singer took to Instagram to share a snap of the advert and gushed over how 'proud' she was with them. </p>

<p>In her caption, she wrote: 'Well done @ITV for standing with Diversity! Proud of you! This image is in all of the national newspapers today.'</p>

<p>Ashley Banjo also shared his gratitude with ITV for standing by Diversity over their Black Lives Matter-inspired performance. </p>

<p>Making a statement: ITV rolled out full-page ads in solidarity with Diversity as Ofcom complaints reach 24,500 over the groups BLM-inspired routine. Ashley pictured</p>

<p>Decision: A spokesperson for government-approved regulatory body Ofcom confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken for Diversity's BLM-inspired routine </p>

<p>The poster showed a poignant black and white image of Ashley taking the knee alongside the words: 'We are changed by what we see. Just as we are changed when we are seen. ITV stand with Diversity.'</p>

<p>Sharing a snap of the same advert, which shows him kneeling in black-and-white, he wrote: 'This is what change looks like.</p>
