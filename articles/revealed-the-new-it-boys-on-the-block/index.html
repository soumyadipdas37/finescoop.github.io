        <p>The entrepreneur and restaurant owner-type It boys of the past have appeared to pave way for a new generation of 'society studs' - who come complete with a whole new image.</p>

<p>From Elizabeth Hurley's son Damien as the 'long-haired looker,' to Piers Morgan's son as the 'sporty squire,' Tatler has revealed the It boys of today. </p>

<p>According to October's issue of the society fashion bible: 'There's a whole new set of rules for the It boys of today. They're not all entrepreneurs, club- and restaurant-owners – they're creators, makers and "curators".' </p>

<p>With suits and ties traded in for the likes of the creative, sensitive and social media savvy, FEMAIL takes a look at some of the most eligible bachelors of today. </p>

<p>THE SPORTY SQUIRE </p>

<p>Spencer Morgan</p>

<p>Spencer Morgan, 27, is the son of Piers Morgan and has followed his his father's journalistic footsteps (pictured)</p>

<p>Spencer Morgan, 27, has followed in his father's journalistic footsteps and is the first of broadcaster Piers' three sons from his first marriage to nurse Marion Shalloe. </p>

<p>According to Tatler, the long-haired sports journalist can often be found in his uniform of black athleisure at White City House or 5 Hertford Street, or out and about in Chelsea. </p>

<p>Quite the jet-setter, his Instagram boasts exotic snaps from the likes of Antigua's Jumby Bay, St Tropez and Ibiza where he can be posing on the back of luxurious yachts,</p>

<p>THE LONG-HAIRED LOOKER</p>

<p>Damian Hurley </p>

<p>Damian Hurley, son of Elizabeth 'Liz' Hurley, during the 10th Mon Cheri Barbara Tag at Isarpost on December 4, 2019 in Munich, Germany</p>

<p>Damian Hurley, 18, is an up and coming model known for his strong resemblance to his mother, actress Elizabeth Hurley.</p>

<p>And the teen can often be found showing off his brunette locks while shirtless, and throwing a smoldering stare to the camera. </p>

<p>He recently appeared in a very steamy make-up campaign alongside supermodel Irina Shayk, 34.</p>

<p>The sensual video, shot prior to the coronavirus lockdown, saw Damian straddled by the leather-clad bombshell as they promoted Pat McGrath's new Dark Star Mascara.</p>

<p>Sharing the video to Instagram Damian wrote alongside: 'the breathtaking @irinashayk and I for my favourite Aunty @PatMcGrathReal, directed by the extraordinary #StevenMeisel.'</p>

<p>His godfather's include Elizabeth's ex Hugh Grant, along with David Beckham, Elton John and Denis Leary.</p>

<p>If Damien isn't in Herefordshure, it's likely he's in London or Chelsea with the likes of India Warrender.</p>

<p>THE BUSINESS BEAUX</p>

<p>Charlie Casely-Hayford</p>

<p>Menswear designer Charlie Casely-Hayford, 34, who is based in London, founded the international menswear brand Casely-Hayford at the age of 22 with his father - acclaimed British fashion designer Joe Casely-Hayford OBE.   </p>

<p>Charlie, who studied at Central Saint Martins, live with his wife, interior designer Sophie Ashby, in the old BBC studios in White City.</p>

<p>He is often spotted attending industry parties.</p>

<p>THE WILD ONE</p>

<p>Cassius Taylor is the 23-year-old son of the Duke of Kent's daughter Lady Helen, and her art dealer husband, Tim Taylor.</p>

<p>Lady Helen was a fashion ambassador and muse to Giorgio Armani for 17 years.  </p>

<p>Cassius, who has made an occasional appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace and is renowned for his laid-back style, studied Arts Management at Goldsmith's University.</p>

<p>According to his LinkedIn, he's 'looking into a career in Music and Fine Art.' </p>

<p>Cassius, who was spotted post-lockdown having a drink with family member, Lady Amelia Windsor in Notting Hill. can also be found one of his father's art parties or a festival. </p>

<p>Amongst his famous friends include Rafferty Law, Iris Law'd brother and Jude Law's son.</p>

<p>THE STYLISH SUITOR</p>

<p>The Maharaja of Jaipur</p>

<p>HRH Maharaja Sawai Padmanabh Singh of Jaipur The Polo Ralph Lauren Suite, Wimbledon Tennis Championships, Day 9, The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London on 10 July 2019</p>

<p>Padmanabh Singh, 22, who has walked for D&amp;G, was crowned as the unofficial Maharaja of Jaipur in 2011, and is a member of the former ruling family of Jaipur State, in present-day Rajasthan, India, and worth an estimated £500-650 million.</p>

<p>Although his title is not officially recogised by law as India is a federal parliamentary democratic republic, the title is still highly respected, and was bestowed to him when his grandfather died, skipping his mother due to her gender, and his father - a former household staff member - as he had no royal blood.</p>

<p>Like his grandfather, Bhawani Sing, Padmanabh, is an accomplished polo player and the youngest ever member of a World Cup polo team in 2017 and the youngest winner of the Indian Open Polo Cup.</p>

<p>He has modelled for D&amp;G and accompanied Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Philippe's daughter Ava to the Bal des Débutantes in Paris in 2017.</p>

<p>The young royal's Instagram - which boasts 130,000 followers - shows a life of travel, and a passion for polo playing across the world.</p>

<p>One picture sees him hanging out with the Dutch royal family, including King Willem Alexander, Queen Maxima and their children.</p>

<p>And he looks to be deeply religious, taking part in Vijaydashmi, a major Hindu festival celebrated at the end of Navaratri every year.</p>

<p>Exotic photos of his travels include South Africa, Italy - previously described as his favourite country - as well as Spain, Thailand, Colombia, Peru and Portugal. </p>

<p>THE MODELISER</p>

<p>Orson Fry </p>

<p>Orson Fry and Alexa Chung attend the Ned's Club Burns supper, featuring a performance by the The Red Hot Chilli Pipers &amp; a Ceilidh, at The Ned on January 25, 2020 in London</p>

<p>Orson Fry, 24, who is in the band Soundtown, is the toyboy beau of fashion It girl Alexa Chung - who is 12 years his senior.</p>

<p>The pair are said to be so besotted that Orson has as good as moved into her swanky apartment in Dalston, East London, while she regularly cheers him on when he performs with his band, Soundtown, in pubs across the capital.</p>

<p>Tongues were set wagging in June when Alexa was spotted with her 'hunk' at the All Points East Festival at Victoria Park – a stone's thrown from her home – prompting whispers that she might have found happiness following her split from True Blood actor Alexander Skarsgard last year.</p>

<p>Orson, whose father is thrice married Cosmo Fry, 60 – a descendant of the Fry's chocolate dynasty – graduated from the private liberal arts college Bard in New York two years ago, and juggles singing in his band with working as a waiter.</p>

<p>His mother was Amanda Aspinall daughter of gambling tycoon and animal park owner John Aspinall. Orson was heartbroken when she died last January aged 61.</p>

<p>When he's not performing, he splits his time between The Ned and Berners Tavern, according to the high society bible.  </p>

<p>THE DYNASTIC DUDE</p>

<p>Julius Getty</p>

<p>(L-R) Julius Getty and Mark Getty attend the opening of the Julius Getty Gallery featuring the 'Dangerous Stuff' exhibition at Julius Getty Gallery on March 28, 2019 in London</p>

<p>Julius, 30, is the youngest son of the Getty images chairman, Mark Getty, and is an art enthusiast and gallerist.</p>

<p>He opened the Julius Getty Gallery in London with Dangerous Stuff, an exhibition featuring work from young creatives, just last year.</p>

<p>According to Tatler, he has since hinted at launching a clothing line called Jetty. As for his social circle, he can be found mingling with India Rose James and the von Bismarck boys.</p>

<p>THE AFFABLE ARISTO</p>

<p>Sam Chatto</p>

<p>Princess Margaret’s grandson Sam Chatto (pictured) has decided to pursue a career as a craftsman</p>

<p>Princess Margaret’s grandson Sam Chatto, who is 24th in line, and son to Lady Sarah and her actor husband Daniel Chatto, quit his commercial art job last summer, to launch a career selling homemade ceramics.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of his uncle, furniture designer David Linley, he decided to pursue a career as a craftsman.</p>

<p>The Old Etonian, who studied history of art at Edinburgh, launched his eponymous website, through which he is selling his own ceramics after becoming disillusioned with his job in the art market.</p>

<p>'I'm working in clay to create functional and sculptural wood-fired ceramics from my home and studio in West Sussex,' he explained previously.</p>

<p>'I've always had a strong affinity with creating objects, having spent much of my childhood crafting imagined landscapes and sculptural models, which naturally led me to clay during my later years at school.'</p>

<p>Now based in West Sussex, Sam previously trained in India to be a yoga instructor. </p>

<p>THE ARTISTIC TYPE</p>

<p>Jimmy Fox </p>

<p>Jimmy Fox attends the MATCHESFASHION X Bella Freud Musical Matches event at 5 Carlos Place featuring a special performance by Little Simz on December 5, 2019 in London</p>

<p>Model and photographer Jimmy, 21, is the son of Bella Freud, and regularly attends fashion and art events alongside Lucas Chancellor and Gene Gallagher.</p>

<p>While Bella was pregnant with Jimmy, whose godfather is the designer Christian Louboutin. she resolved to give her baby the structured upbringing she never had.</p>

<p>‘After we came back from Morocco, I lived with Penny Guinness, who was a girlfriend of my father’s,’ she later said. ‘Even though we were travelling around in gypsy caravans, she always made me go to bed at 9pm. And I did enjoy that.</p>

<p>‘It stuck in my head for my own child-rearing. I wanted to be around as much as I possibly could.’</p>
