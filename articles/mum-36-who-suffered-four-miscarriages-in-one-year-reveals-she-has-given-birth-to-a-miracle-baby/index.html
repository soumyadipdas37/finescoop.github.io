        <p>A delighted mum has finally celebrated the birth of her 'miracle' baby after suffering four miscarriages in just over a year.</p>

<p>Beth Sheriff, 36, from York, and partner partner Darren Woodhead, 35, lost five pregnancies in three years in what she described as the 'hardest' time in her life - but now she says has 'never felt so happy' after giving birth to little Felix.</p>

<p>The determined mum was first left with a heart-breaking decision in October 2017, when she was told she had to terminate her pregnancy - or risk losing her ability to walk.</p>

<p>She had suffered a severe slipped disc and required surgery, but had no idea she was five weeks pregnant until doctors at Hull Royal Hospital performed a routine check. </p>

<p> Beth Sheriff, 36, from York, has finally celebrated the birth of her 'miracle' baby after suffering four miscarriages in just over a year</p>

<p>'Miracle' baby Felix (pictured) was born after the couple lost five pregnancies in three years</p>

<p>Beth and Darren (pictured) told how they chose the name Felix because it means lucky in Latin</p>

<p>It was the toughest decision she'd ever made, and something she would 'never, ever do' in normal circumstances.</p>

<p>She said losing the baby made her and Darren realise that they wanted to have a family together.</p>

<p>But the pair suffered through four agonising miscarriages in the space of just over a year and were given no explanations.</p>

<p>Their three year nightmare finally came to an end on June 23 this year, when 'beautiful' Felix was born at York District Hospital weighing 6lbs 3oz. </p>

<p>Speaking of Felix (pictured), Beth said: 'It was sixth time lucky. He is our little miracle and we could not have asked for more. He has completed our little family.'</p>

<p>The couple's three year nightmare finally came to an end on June 23 this year, when 'beautiful' Felix was born at York District Hospital weighing 6lbs 3oz (pictured)</p>

<p>'Holding my beautiful little baby after everything we'd been through for the first time - it was just surreal,' explained Beth. 'I just felt so overwhelmed - I've never felt so happy in my life.</p>

<p>'We named him Felix because it means lucky and that's how we feel. There are no words to describe just how grateful and lucky we feel to have him with us.</p>

<p>'It was so hard going through the recurrent miscarriages, just unimaginably painful. But now that he's with us, this entire journey has been so worthwhile.'</p>

<p>The couple's journey started in October 2017 in unexpected circumstances - as they had no idea she was pregnant.</p>

<p>The service advisor said: 'I had a slipped disc and had gone to surgery and didn't even know I was pregnant until I was in hospital and they did a few checks.</p>

<p>Beth said there was ' so much anxiety each and every day' because she just wanted everything to be 'perfect.' Pictured, baby Felix</p>

<p>Doctors were unable to explain why Beth and Darren kept miscarrying which left her feeling frustrated. Pictured, with Felix</p>

<p>Speaking of her pregnancy, Beth said she and Darren were just taking it 'a day at the time' and hoping they'd keep pushing on without issues. Pictured, baby Felix</p>

<p>'It was really shocking and unexpected but we were forced into a decision because they said my slipped disc was so severe it needed immediate surgery or I could lose the ability to walk.</p>

<p>'It was the toughest decision I've had to make but the right one - and we decided to terminate the baby.</p>

<p>'We knew we wanted children eventually, but we didn't want one then or knew I was pregnant.</p>

<p>'But terminating the pregnancy - it was such a difficult and dark moment for us as it's something I would have never, ever done.'</p>

<p>The couple tried to have a baby soon after, but sadly she miscarried after six weeks in March 2018.</p>

<p>They tried again, but in June she miscarried for the second time, this time after eight weeks.</p>

<p>The determined couple tried again, but sadly Beth miscarried just three days before Christmas after 12 weeks.</p>

<p>She was hoping to announce the good news to her family on Christmas Day but was left devastated when she found out she'd lost her baby.</p>

<p>The pregnancy wasn't without its issues, as Beth suffered bleeding at five weeks and again at 11. Pictured, baby Felix</p>

<p>When Beth first felt Felix (pictured) move inside her, she felt 'so happy' and added that it was 'just amazing'</p>

<p>Beth, who has a 15-year-old son called Joshua Cannon with a previous partner, said doctors were unable to explain why they kept miscarrying which left her feeling frustrated.</p>

<p>Tests revealed that in one of the miscarriages, the fetus had a missing chromosome linked to Turner Syndrome, but there were no explanations for the other failed pregnancies.</p>

<p>'We just wanted to know why we couldn't seem to have a baby,' she said. 'But after tests everything came back positive and they couldn't explain it.'</p>

<p>'It was hard to deal with every day. We were told there was no reason at all which made it more frustrating.</p>

<p>'It was the most difficult time in my life - and we kept feeling like we were hitting rock bottom. But we kept trying and we never lost hope.'</p>

<p>In June 2019, Beth sadly miscarried again at 10 and a half weeks - her fourth in just over a year.</p>

<p>'You feel like you can't grieve because you haven't had a baby yet but it still hurts so much,' said the mum-of-two. 'You just have to get up and carry on.'</p>

<p>'I felt like I was grieving but no one knew what we were going through - it was very lonely. It's not something you can talk about.'</p>

<p>The determined mum was first left with a heart-breaking decision in October 2017, when she was told she had to terminate her pregnancy - or risk losing her ability to walk. Pictured, with baby Felix</p>

<p>Felix is now 12 weeks old and enjoying life at home with his big brother Joshua and their family dogs Walter and Elmo (pictured)</p>

<p>By the sixth attempt, she says their expectations were tempered to the point even partner Darren wasn't optimistic - despite his usual encouraging demeanour.</p>

<p>'We were just taking it a day at the time and hoping we'd keep pushing on without issues,' she explained. </p>

<p>But the pregnancy wasn't without its issues, as she suffered bleeding at five weeks and again at 11.</p>

<p>To add to the already mounting stress and anxiety, Beth was forced to have weekly scans which left her feeling uneasy.</p>

<p>She added: 'There was just so much anxiety each and every day. We wanted this to be perfect but it was so stressful.</p>

<p>'But when I first felt him move inside me I felt so happy - it was just amazing.'</p>

<p>Beth says she began to count the days until little Felix was born and wondered if he was ever coming.</p>

<p>But Felix is now 12 weeks old and enjoying life at home with his big brother Joshua and their family dogs Walter and Elmo. </p>
