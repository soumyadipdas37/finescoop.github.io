    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Barry Hall has opened up the rapid deterioration of his relationship with his father after quitting boxing in his youth - and his struggles adapting to post-football life.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old was candid about his tumultuous relationship with his father, who refused to speak with him 'for years' after chasing his dream into the AFL.</p>

<p>Hall grew up in Broadford, north of Melbourne, where his dad Ray wanted his son to become a boxer, a sport Hall excelled at as a youngster. </p>

<p>But the allure of the AFL proved too strong for the 289-game veteran, leading to a heartbreaking conversation with his father - and the start of their rocky relationship.</p>

<p>Barry Hall (pictured with wife Lauren Brant) has opened up on his childhood and mental struggles after his AFL career</p>

<p>Hall clashes with Travis Gaspar of the West Coast Eagles during the Sydney Swans 2005 AFL Grand Final victory at the MCG</p>

<p>Hall clips Paul Gallen with a clean left hand during their Code War boxing bout in Melbourne in November 2019</p>

<p>'I was boxing at one stage and was 15 about to turn 16. I really didn’t want to do it. I wanted to play footy because my mates were,' Hall told The Herald Sun Sacked podcast.</p>

<p>'I told my Dad I didn’t want to fight anymore. And that’s when the s**t hit the fan.</p>

<p>'He didn’t speak to me for years after that, which you might think is an exaggeration. But sitting at the table, (there were) no words, no nothing.'</p>

<p>Without any backing from his parents, Hall was selected to play for the Murray Bushrangers in Wangaratta when he was 16 and fought his way into the AFL.</p>

<p>He debuted for St Kilda in 1996 and kicked 746 goals in his illustrious football career, culminating in captaining the Sydney Swans to a premiership in 2005.</p>

<p>Hall said he used to imagine lifting the premiership cup in his backyard as a kid using a block of wood as the trophy.</p>

<p>'I was getting injections to get through games, so to hold the cup up was quite a struggle,' he said. </p>

<p>'I still get emotional about it now. It is something no one can ever take away and the Swans have it in their trophy cabinet (forever).'</p>

<p>Hall's 16-season career was highly controversial, with his aggressive playing style rubbing off into several 'brain fart' incidents on the field, including his brutal blindsided punch to Brent Staker in 2008.</p>

<p>Hall threatens Brisbane Lions player Chris Johnson during a match in August 2003. Hall's aggressive nature on the field was a hallmark of his career</p>

<p>'I regretted it straight away. As soon as I watched it on the big screen, I thought "I’m in a bit of trouble",' Hall said.</p>

<p>The father-of-two believes his difficult childhood led him to develop anger issues, which generated some explosive reactions on the footy field. </p>

<p>'It was one of those days when it was a ticking time bomb,' he said.</p>

<p>Hall was suspended for seven games for hitting Staker and copped another game on the sideline for an attempted strike at Collingwood’s Shane Wakelin in his second game back. </p>

<p>Hall was sacked from the Swans in 2009 after his conduct on the field led to a falling out with Swans coach Paul Roos.</p>

<p>'It got a bit heated,' he said. 'I was a premiership captain of the club and (Roos) was not answering my phone call.</p>

<p>'I knew something had to happen from a club perspective. I was upset because it strained so many relationships.'</p>

<p>Hall signed with the Western Bulldogs for the final two seasons of his career, where he was treated for depression, before retiring in 2011.</p>

<p>Hall celebrates with Western Bulldogs team mate Ben Hudson in the final match of his career in September 2011</p>

<p>Hall suffered from an identity crisis after footy, where his weight ballooned to 125 kilograms on the back of poor dietary choices and drinking heavily. </p>

<p>'All your structure is gone, your identity is gone. You fall into a state of depression, (thinking) "What am I now if I am not that?"' he said. </p>

<p>'I was eating crap, I was drinking every night and when I drink, I don’t just have a couple, I strap it on.'</p>

<p>Hall's mental health and identity struggles only got worse in his retirement, including being fired from Triple M in 2018.</p>

<p>Hall and his Triple M colleagues were speaking about former St Kilda star Leigh Montagna's partner, who had recently undergone a medical procedure known as a 'sweep', which can induce labour. </p>

<p>'The doctor was a good looking rooster and around 40 years of age. He did a sweep with his fingers and licked his fingers afterwards,' Hall said on live radio.   </p>

<p>He was immediately sacked by the radio station for his comments and swiftly apologised for what he said was a 'silly thing to say'.</p>

<p>Hall (pictured with wife Lauren and children Miller and Houston) suffered an identity crisis after footy, where he drank heavily</p>

<p>Hall was sacked from Triple M after making insensitive comments about former St Kilda star Leigh Montagna's partner (pictured left) before giving birth</p>

<p>'It is not a reflection of who I am or what my views are. I am a proud father and dedicated partner and have nothing but respect for women,' Hall said at the time.</p>

<p>The call dried up his income, leaving Hall, his partner Lauren Brant and young son Miller in a tough space.</p>

<p>'All the endorsements I had, and every other revenue stream I had was gone,' he said.</p>

<p>'I had no money coming in. We weren’t broke. We had a roof over our heads and food on the tables, but it was challenging.'</p>

<p>Hall and the former Hi-5 singer went on to welcome their second son Houston in May 2019.</p>

<p>'I kiss my kids 20 or 30 times a day,' he said. 'I have so much love for them. I just don’t know how you could not do that as a father.'</p>

<p>Hall with his sons Houston and Miller. He believes his childhood was the genesis of his anger issues in later life</p>

<p>Hall is using his time in the coronavirus pandemic to help Victorians struggling with poor mental health in a program called Blokes United.</p>

<p>The initiative was launched by Hall, former Fremantle player Richard Maloney and North Melbourne star Shaun Higgins and is aimed at lowering suicide rates among men. </p>

<p>The men offer help via online conference calls to their 13,000 members, which provide tips and tools with different guests each week. </p>

<p>'It is almost a sense of therapy for me. I like helping people and it makes me feel good about myself as well,' Hall said.</p>

<p>Hall believes his difficult childhood lead him to understand his anger issues later in life and how to take responsibility for his actions. </p>

<p>'You have to understand it to be able to fix it,' he said.</p>

<p>'It took me getting sacked (by the Swans) to go to the Western Bulldogs to really do some work on myself.</p>

<p>'I was finally prepared to listen and open my mind and accept responsibility.'</p>
