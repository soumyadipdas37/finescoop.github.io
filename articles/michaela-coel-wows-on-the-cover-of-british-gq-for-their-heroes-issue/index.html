        <p>Michaela Coel has revealed that she is freezing her eggs 'just in case' she wants children in the future.</p>

<p>The I May Destroy You star, 32, has spoke to Donald Glover for November's edition of  British GQ as part of their Heroes issue.</p>

<p>Michaela, who wowed in a stunning cover and shoot for the magazine, and Donald, 37, also discussed their experiences with race during the candid interview. </p>

<p>Candid: Michaela Coel has revealed that she is freezing her eggs 'just in case' she wants children in the future</p>

<p>Talking about whether she wants to have children in the future, the actress admitted that she worries that she doesn't think about having babies 'as much as I should'.</p>

<p>Michaela added that she is freezing her eggs 'just in case' she wants a child later in life although she has also considered adopting.</p>

<p>She said: 'Sometimes I worry that I don't [think about having children] as much as I should, which is why, just in case I ever think about this more, I'm freezing my eggs, just in case. </p>

<p>'I've never been too thinky about bearing my own children through my vagina. I have thought about adopting. That I've thought of more than vaginal children. But in case I changed my mind, because I don't know, they say it happens... </p>

<p>Stunning: The I May Destroy You star, 32, has spoke to Donald Glover for November's edition of British GQ as part of their Heroes issue where she wowed in a stunning cover and shoot </p>

<p>'Like, you reach this point where suddenly you really want babies and all you can think about is you want a baby and the clock's ticking.' </p>

<p>She added: 'I don't ever have that. I've never felt it. I've never even said, 'I want to have a baby,' ever in my life. So I'm freezing them in case that hits me later.' </p>

<p>Freezing allows women to store their eggs at a young age so they can be used in IVF when they want a family.</p>

<p>Freezing allows women to store their eggs at a young age so they can be used in IVF when they want a family.</p>

<p>This gives them a greater chance of conceiving as the quality of the eggs they produce as they get older deteriorates.</p>

<p>But so far fewer than a fifth have a baby after using their frozen eggs, according to the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). </p>

<p>It has an average UK cost of £8,000.</p>

<p>This gives them a greater chance of conceiving as the quality of the eggs they produce as they get older deteriorates.  </p>

<p>Elsewhere during the interview, Michaela revealed that she is taking a break at the moment and is using the month of September to 'just live'.</p>

<p>Asked about her next project following the success of I May Destroy You, she said: 'I'm asked this question and I have an answer that I give, which is, 'I'm taking a break.' However, it's been a while now. </p>

<p>'And even though I'm still technically working, because, hey, we're doing press, there is, like, there's a tiny seed far away. I'm just on the edges. I don't know. I have something in my womb. </p>

<p>'I sometimes equate my show with children. So the inception might be beginning.'</p>

<p>Michaela teasingly added: 'There's something, but for now, I'm trying to just live for a minute. I think I've given myself September to just live.'</p>

<p>The star went on to discuss her experience with white friends preferring black men, she said: 'So, basically, I say, "What do you mean?" And one, who is my very dear friend, said, "I just feel more comfortable around them, the way they treat me."</p>

<p>'And I don't know if I ever say, "Well, white men treat me like this. Black men treat me like this. I tend to feel more this around a white man. I tend to feel this around black men." And if I ever have, I've questioned it.'</p>

<p>Interviewer: Michaela, who wowed in a stunning cover and shoot for the magazine, and Donald, 37, pictured in 2019, also discussed their experiences with race during the candid interview </p>

<p>Talking about his experiences with race, interviewer Donald added: 'An interviewer asked me once something like, "Would you rather have been white and not get the experience of being black?" </p>

<p>'And I remember being like, "Would you rather see all the opportunities and not have them or have all the opportunities and not see them?" </p>

<p>'Because I think one thing that black people don't understand because they're not white is that white people can't see most of this stuff. The idea of "I love black men."</p>

<p>'Your friend might be thinking, "Well, I've heard black women say this." And it's like, "Yes, you have, because they've eaten a whole cake of being black and they understand that idea on a deeper level." </p>

<p>'So it's up to you to decide: "Do I want to have a conversation with this person?"'</p>

<p>Donald also reflected on the senseless killing of George Floyd, who choked to death while being restrained by white police officer Derek Chauvin in Minnesota on Monday May 25, he knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes.</p>

<p>The Community actor said: 'I was in the hospital bed. My son had just been born, like, an hour before and I was watching the George Floyd video. It was such a weird moment. </p>

<p>'It was such an intense, weird moment, because I’m watching that video and it’s like eight minutes long, so you’re sitting there and I had just had this amazing, joyful, expanding moment, plus my dad had passed away recently, so [my son] was named after my father... </p>

<p>What a woman! Michaela's recent series, I May Destroy You, became one of the summer's most critically-acclaimed shows around the world (pictured in show still)  </p>

<p>'I don’t even know what, really, the word is to describe it. It was just expanding: the empathy and compassion and the terror and the joy of it.'</p>

<p>Michaela's recent series, I May Destroy You, became one of the summer's most critically-acclaimed shows around the world.   </p>

<p>The 12-part BBC1 series, which also premiered on HBO, fearlessly dives into hard-hitting issues affecting the lives of young London-based writer Arabella (Michaela Coel) and her close group of friends.   </p>

<p>It follows Arabella as she comes to terms with a sexual assault after her drink was spiked at a nightclub, in a storyline based on the harrowing real-life experience of Michaela, who also wrote, co-directed and executive produced the series. </p>

<p>Critically-acclaimed: It follows Arabella as she comes to terms with a sexual assault after her drink was spiked at a nightclub, in a storyline based on the harrowing real-life experience of Michaela, pictured in still, who also wrote, co-directed and executive produced the series  </p>

<p>Talking about the powerful series, and people's attraction to death, Donald said: 'We're attracted to that, though. I mean, if you look on the internet, people are just like, "Twenty twenty? I'm out." </p>

<p>'People are very attracted to that kind of thought process. They're just like, "Man, who else is gonna die?" They're kind of excited. Because it’s attractive. Death is attractive – or just the end of something. It's something that's mysterious. </p>

<p>'For me, I May Destroy You is really about the power of the infinite and how our power is constantly changing. It’s an evolving power.' </p>

<p>British GQ's Heroes issue, which will also be a virtual event in October where Michaela is a speaker, is a summit that hosts the great and the good in entertainment, politics, advocacy, sport, luxury, media, art and tech. </p>
