        <p>Chelsea host Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in Premier League action this afternoon as Frank Lampard's new looking squad face their toughest test of the new season.  </p>

<p>The Blues spent big over the summer to close the gap to Liverpool and Manchester City and this will be a huge test of their title credentials.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp welcome Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota to his squad in a spending spree of his own this week and the Spanish international has a chance to make his debut this afternoon.</p>

<p>Sportsmail will provide live EPL coverage of Chelsea vs Liverpool including score, lineups and build-up.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Paul Tierney blows his whistle and Liverpool emerge victorious at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The Premier League champions were shaky last week but make no mistake, they are the team to beat as Jurgen Klopp's men sent out a statement to the rest of the division.</p>

<p>The front three are so lethal and today it was Sadio Mane who did the business for the Reds with a quickfire double that put away a sorry Chelsea.</p>

<p>Despite their big money signings, Frank Lampard has plenty of work to do to close the gap on the top two teams, if this showing is anything to go by. </p>

<p>90+3 mins: Another chance for Liverpool! Wonderful work from Salah who rolls Kante, he fires straight at Kepa who stands strong and Wijnaldum cannot react to the rebound and it goes wide.</p>

<p>90+2 mins: Chance Liverpool! Mane fancies a hat trick and hits a shot from range. It takes a deflection off Tomori and Kepa is there to make a very good save. That was heading straight in. </p>

<p>90+1 mins: Three minutes of added time as Liverpool play another corner short as they wind down the clock on an impressive performance.</p>

<p>87 mins: Chance Liverpool! Salah plays a beautiful cross with the outside of his left foot and it falls well for Van Dijk, who chests down but is unable to prod beyond Kepa.</p>

<p>That would have been the icing on the cake for the champions. </p>

<p>86 mins: Liverpool seeing this out with ease now, as the visitors win another corner after Salah's cross is turned behind.</p>

<p>Klopp's final change is made with Minamino coming on for Roberto Firmino. </p>

<p>84 mins: Chance Chelsea! Abraham is played in down the left hand side, the striker opens his body up for an effort at goal and its a good strike but Alisson is down quickly to parry away. </p>

<p>82 mins: Alexander-Arnold is released in behind and the England international lifts a cross to the back post for Mane, but James is there to head behind for a corner. </p>

<p>Chance Liverpool! The corner is cleared only as far as Thiago who drills a low effort at goal but it fizzes just wide. </p>

<p>79 mins: Salah lays the ball off for his team-mate and Alexander-Arnold looks to bend it in the top corner but it's too strong and sails over. </p>

<p>Double change for Chelsea with Tammy Abraham and Ross Barkley on for Kovacic and Jorginho.</p>

<p>78 mins: Liverpool have a free kick just outside the penalty area after Tomori brings down Roberto Firmino. Possibly quite harsh, that. Salah and Alexander-Arnold are stood over it, with the Egyptian keen to take. </p>

<p>77 mins: It is normal service resumed as Liverpool have Chelsea pinned back in their own half. It's been walking football for much of the half although that penalty has woken them up, and they've upped the tempo slightly. </p>

<p>Jorginho steps up to take it and Alisson Becker saves! It's a rather tame effort to the keeper's left and the Brazilian is equal to it and parries away.</p>

<p>Yesterday we saw drama with David de Gea being off his line, but replays show Alisson's foot was on the line when the penalty was struck.</p>

<p>Well then, Chelsea have a penalty and a possible lifeline! And it's fantastic work from Timo Werner who drives from the left with Thiago on his tail. The new man makes contact and Paul Tierney points to the spot. </p>

<p>VAR is checking for a possible foul in the build up, though. Nothing doing, Jorginho to take. </p>

<p>71 mins: Liverpool keeping hold of the ball nicely here as the visitors knock it from side to side. You feel at any moment they can launch an attack on this vulnerable Chelsea side. </p>

<p>68 mins: Chelsea have the ball out of their own half and are knocking the ball around Liverpool's area. Mount is found in space and curls an effort towards Alisson's goal but it's not quite accurate enough and drifts over.</p>

<p>66 mins: Chance Liverpool! Wijnaldum burst into the box and his run is picked out. The Dutchman lines up for a shot and fires towards Kepa's near post but the Spaniard is equal to it and beats it away.</p>

<p>65 mins: Lovely play from Thiago as he shimmies past Jorginho on the right and clips a ball towards Salah at the back post, but it's slightly too heavy and goes behind for a goal kick.</p>

<p>64 mins: Second change for the visitors as Naby Keita makes way for James Milner, who takes the captain's armband off Van Dijk.</p>

<p>61 mins: Corner for Liverpool after a Salah shot is deflected behind. Robertson's ball is nodded behind by Jorginho for another corner.</p>

<p>60 mins: It's one way traffic for the champions now. Mane combines with Robertson down the left, and the Senegalese dinks the ball into Naby Keita who lays it off for his team-mate but he can't get his shot off and Chelsea scurry the ball away. </p>

<p>They are enjoying themselves out there.</p>

<p>59 mins: It's the start to the second half that Frank Lampard would have been dreading, and he has switched to a 4-4-1 formation in a bid to get his side back into the game. </p>

<p>"Great header, great goal!"Sadio Mane gives Liverpool the lead against 10-man Chelsea.📺 Watch on Sky Sports PL📱 Follow #CHELIV here: https://t.co/gopmotG3I8📲 Download the @SkySports app! pic.twitter.com/NqRWGAY3UD</p>

<p>Another goal for Liverpool! And it's an absolute howler for Kepa. Tomori plays a pass back to his goalkeeper after Sadio Mane gives it away, who takes a touch and looks for a team-mate. But the Senegalese is chasing him down and nabs the ball off the Chelsea stopper and puts the ball home. </p>

<p>This could get very ugly for Chelsea.</p>

<p>52 mins: Liverpool are swarming all over Chelsea. They smell blood. Lampard's side are really struggling to get out given their 10-man disadvantage. </p>

<p>Liverpool have made the breakthrough! The free kick comes to nothing but Liverpool will not let loose. Firmino and Salah play a delightful one-two to get past Alonso. The Brazilian chips a deft ball across and Sadio Mane is there to head beyond Kepa and give Klopp's side a deserved lead.</p>

<p>49 mins: Liverpool win a free kick just outside the Chelsea penalty area on the left after James takes down Mane. Robertson to take. </p>

<p>48 mins: Liverpool win a corner and it is taken short by Robertson to Mane. The ball is played towards Thiago but his cross can't find a Liverpool man and Chelsea clear.</p>

<p>Robertson sends a delightful ball in but it's cleared away. This could be a struggle for Chelsea.</p>

<p>47 mins: Chelsea are playing a 4-3-2 after that change, retaining the midfield three as they look to keep their defensive shape. It will be up to Liverpool to break them down.</p>

<p>And it is going to be a change for Chelsea, too, with Tomori replacing Havertz following Christensen's red card.</p>

<p>Thiago is introduced for Jordan Henderson. An injury perhaps? Klopp will be hoping the Spaniard can unlock the sturdy Chelsea defence. Virgil van Dijk takes the captain's armband. </p>

<p>Werner gets the ball rolling and the second half is under way.</p>

<p>We're almost ready for the second half, and it looks as though the visitors are making a change at the break, with new man Thiago readying himself for action.</p>

<p>Red or yellow?Did the referee get it right with Andreas Christensen's dismissal?📺 Watch on Sky Sports PL📱 Follow #CHELIV here: https://t.co/gopmotG3I8📲 Download the @SkySports app! pic.twitter.com/zLX0HvUUd0</p>

<p>Paul Tierney blows his whistle to bring the first half to a close, and it remains 0-0 at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>The Premier League champions have had the better of it, dominating the ball and suffocating Chelsea, with the hosts struggling to break the press. Werner has looked lively in spells but Fabinho has handled him well.</p>

<p>Lampard would have been pleased that his side haven't conceded, but the loss of Christensen just before the break could prove crucial in how this tie plays out now. </p>

<p>An interesting second half to come. </p>

<p>45+2 mins: It's a good effort from range but not quite accurate enough and that'll be that for the first half.</p>

<p>One minute of added time as Alexander-Arnold lines up the free kick. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Tierney overrules his original decision and brandishes a red card to the Danish defender. </p>

<p>Christensen had no chance of winning the ball and with Kepa off his line, Mane would have taken it around the keeper, denying a goalscoring opportunity. </p>

<p>44 mins: Liverpool catch Chelsea cold after a decent attack from the hosts, with Henderson launching the ball long for Mane. Christensen is well behind him and almost rugby tackles him to the ground as Kepa approaches.</p>

<p>Could that be a red card? VAR is looking at it, and now Paul Tierney is looking at the pitchside monitor. </p>

<p>41 mins: Havertz takes and sends a delicious ball into the box but there is no Chelsea player attacking the area and Liverpool see out the danger.</p>

<p>40 mins: Chelsea win a free kick on the corner of Liverpool's penalty box after Henderson takes out Werner. Reece James is lining up to take it, as is Havertz.</p>

<p>38 mins: Chance Chelsea! Havertz is played in behind by Kante, the German squares it to his countryman Werner who pulls his shot wide.</p>

<p>But the linesman's flag is up and play is brought back for offside, sparing Werner's blushes.</p>

<p>36 mins: Another chance for Liverpool! Henderson picks out Robertson on the back post, the Scot lines up for a strike and his volley thunders into the ground and goes wide. </p>

<p>Can they break the deadlock with ten minutes left of the first half? </p>

<p>35 mins: Chance Liverpool! The ball is then recycled to Alexander-Arnold who finds Salah with a lofted ball over the top. The attacker brings it down and drills it across goal but there is no one there to meet it and Chelsea breathe a sigh of relief. </p>

<p>34 mins: Liverpool have a corner after Christensen fails to keep the ball in play. Zouma is up again to power the corner clear. </p>

<p>33 mins: Chance Chelsea! And it comes from good work from Kante, who is picked out over the top by James. The midfielder finds Werner who gets past his man via a ricochet and lines up a shot at goal but his effort drifts just wide of Alisson's goal. </p>

<p>32 mins: Alonso finds fellow full back Reece James with a switch of play, the youngster drills a low cross in but Robertson is there to clear out for a throw in. </p>

<p>31 mins: Chelsea get out through Werner and the German has the chance to run at Liverpool's back four with the ball at his feet. He is shepherded wide and is forced to play back, allowing Liverpool to return to their defensive shape. </p>

<p>30 mins: Half an hour gone and Liverpool have Chelsea at arm's length, albeit lacking the all-important goal required. The Blues are struggling to get out with Liverpool's midfield superior to Chelsea's central trio thus far. </p>

<p>But at 0-0 Chelsea have the firepower to take a surprise lead.</p>

<p>27 mins: Werner sends a long ball in the direction of Havertz but Alexander-Arnold is on hand to clear up and Liverpool regain possession.</p>

<p>25 mins: Liverpool have a free kick fifteenyards outside the Chelsea box. Can they make their pressure count?</p>

<p>The answer is no as Alexander-Arnold's delivery is cleared away by Kurt Zouma.</p>

<p>24 mins: Liverpool work their way into the Chelsea penalty area through Salah. The Egyptian picks out Alexander-Arnold's overlapping run but the young full back can't find a man in red and his low cross is cut out. </p>

<p>22 mins: That 90-second spell showed that this game is more than capable of bursting into life, but it has settled back down slightly, with both ready to pounce on a mistake.</p>

<p>20 mins: Kante bursts forward but elects not to pick out Werner, who is in an offside position, and tries to squeeze a ball through to Havertz but it is cut out by Fabinho.</p>

<p>Liverpool are down the other end with Salah but the Egyptian's shot is blocked and Chelsea are away through Werner, he is one on one with Fabinho but the Brazilian stands tall and pinches the ball off him.</p>

<p>End-to-end stuff!</p>

<p>18 mins: Great work from Werner, Havertz and Mount sees Kante with the ball in Liverpool's penalty area, but the midfielder dawdles and Liverpool have enough back to thwart the danger. Their best piece of play so far.</p>

<p>14 mins: Chance Liverpool! And what on earth was Kepa doing there. The ball is played across the box and the Spaniard thinks he has a chance of collecting but Salah nips in front of him, plays a cross in and Christensen gets there first to knock it behind for a corner, which comes to nothing.</p>

<p>Pretty shaky from the £71m man there.</p>

<p>12 mins: First shot of the game as Salah pulls the ball back for Wijnaldum but his shot is wayward and drifts wide of Kepa's post. Liverpool have started the game the better of the two sides.</p>

<p>11 mins: Liverpool are enjoying the lion's share of possession after the first ten minutes or so. </p>

<p>Neat combination play from Mane and Firmino sees the pair bypass a couple of Chelsea defenders but they can't work an opportunity. The ball finds Salah who falls under a challenge but Paul Tierney says no dice.</p>

<p>8 mins: Robertson is released down the left hand side. His first time cut back can't find a man in red and Chelsea clear but Liverpool recycle possession and win a corner.</p>

<p>Chelsea had problems defending set pieces last season but manage to thwart the danger as the hosts clear the corner.</p>

<p>7 mins: Chelsea are set up to play out of the back from the goal kicks but Liverpool are set up like a coiled spring ready to pounce should a short pass be played. Kepa launches it long and Van Dijk makes a mess of clearing it as he hooks it skyward but Alexander-Arnold is there to tidy up. </p>

<p>5 mins: Trent Alexander-Arnold sends a teasing ball in behind for Salah to chase but it's a tad too heavy and Kepa is out to collect. </p>

<p>3 mins: The visitors are setting their stall as they look to put pressure on Chelsea as they retain posession at the back. </p>

<p>Werner is released down the left hand side, he skips past Fabinho but his pass is cut out at the last. The German has another go at Fabinho but the Brazilian gets the better of the striker on that occasion. </p>

<p>2 mins: Henderson sends a raking diagonal ball across the pitch but it can't find a man in red and Kepa collects. Chelsea are just knocking the ball across the defensive line as both sides feel each other out in the early stages. </p>

<p>The players take the knee in support of anti-racism and Roberto Firmino gets the ball rolling and we are under way for this afternoon's showdown between Chelsea and Liverpool.</p>

<p>Not long now until this mammoth clash gets under way at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Chelsea have made a statement in the transfer market this summer and will be looking for an equally vocal statement come full time. </p>

<p>Liverpool looked leaky last week and with a makeshift centre back in Fabinho deployed in defence, Chelsea could cause the champions problems today.</p>

<p>The players are on their way out onto the pitch and kick off is coming soon.</p>

<p>Getting ready for another big game 👊#CHELIV pic.twitter.com/nZB9idxW4U</p>

<p>Different games bring different problems. We are playing the best team in the country and with Kovacic he gives you a presence in midfield. </p>

<p>We spent a lot of time a long way behind Liverpool last year, so for me now we are level points with them now so it is a barometer. We competed well with them in each of our games with them last year.</p>

<p>We've had a conversation about what it might look like. Fabinho has played centre back before and knows that role. They are as strong as they normally are. </p>

<p>We are all striving for fitness with the recent situation, if we keep the ball and move the ball well it might give us a bit more rest in the game.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp</p>

<p>I didn't think for a second about starting him [Thiago] today. It's really funny that people consider that. Whatever he plays for us is different to Bayern, we play most of the time different. </p>

<p>They are technically good, quick, have a good idea, they are a top four team in England that;s how it is. It should not be a pure joy to play against us so let's see what we get from it.</p>

<p>Van Dijk on Timo Werner </p>

<p>He's a fantastic player, that's why they bought him. It will be a good test. He is not the only one, the Chelsea team is full of quality, we have to be ready.</p>

<p>While Chelsea got their season off to a strong start with a win at Brighton, questions were raised once again about the capabilities of Kepa in goal. </p>

<p>The Blues are closing in on the signing of Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, but their £71m signing will be looking to make his mark this afternoon.</p>

<p>The lads arrive at the Bridge! 👊#CHELIV pic.twitter.com/DTdR6abuS4</p>

<p>It was all rather tense between the two dugouts the last time Chelsea and Liverpool met, which was a matter of weeks ago at Anfield. </p>

<p>Frank Lampard launched an X-rated rant at his counterpart and pre-match comments about transfer spending has served to highlight there is no love lost between the pair. </p>

<p>So it looks like Lampard has gone for a back four today, with Havertz, Mount and Werner operating as a front three.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, injuries to Joe Gomez and Joel Matip means Fabinho will play as a makeshift centre half alongside Virgil van Dijk. Thiago is on the bench while Diogo Jota does not make the squad. </p>

<p>Today's line-up 🆚 @ChelseaFC...Gomez (minor knock) and Matip (minor muscle issue) both miss out. Thiago named on the bench.</p>

<p>☑ Chelsea team news! #CHELIV pic.twitter.com/eFsOYNmdi1</p>

<p>We'll have the starting XIs for both sides in the next five minutes or so. What can we expect from both managers this afternoon?</p>

<p>New boy Thiago may be handed a start although it is unlikely that Diogo Jota will force his way past Mo Salah, Sadio Mane or Roberto Firmino.</p>

<p>We know there will be no Antonio Rudiger today, but it will be interesting to see what system Lampard utilises this afternoon.</p>

<p>It may only be the second game of the season for these two clubs but this afternoon's game could be a season-definer with Chelsea looking to close the gap on Jurgen Klopp's champions, who romped home to their first league title in 30 years last campaign.</p>

<p>Sportsmail takes a look at the tactical battles we can expect this afternoon.</p>

<p>Team news may not be out yet, but Sportsmail understands that Antonio Rudiger has been left out of Lampard's matchday squad this afternoon, casting doubt over the defender's future at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Good afternoon and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of Chelsea vs. Liverpool in the Premier League.</p>

<p>We've had goals galore across the top flight this weekend and this afternoon's fixture promises more of the same, with an array of attacking talent expected to be on show for the Premier League champions and Frank Lampard's side.</p>

<p>Both clubs have splashed the cash this summer, and how the likes of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Thiago Alcantara adapt to the game today will make for interesting viewing.</p>

<p>Stay tuned as we provide build up towards the 4.30pm kick off. Team news is expected in around half an hour. </p>
