        <p>After his longtime friend Janelle Pierzina was evicted last week, Kaysar Ridha has found himself on the chopping block once again on Sunday's night episode of Big Brother All-Stars.</p>

<p>Thursday night's episode ended with a unique contest to determine the next Head of Household, where the houseguests had to roll tennis balls up large inclines and get the balls to land in three holes.</p>

<p>While Kaysar tried his hardest to win and secure his safety, he would ultimately find himself on the chopping block again, with a rather surprising selection made by the new Head of Household, Enzo Palumbo.</p>

<p>Cody still thinks it was Dani who voted for Kaysar but she keeps insisting it wasn't her, as everyone else comes in including David, who swears on his life that it wasn't him.</p>

<p>Da'vonne and Bayleigh: Da'vonne and Bayleigh also wonder who voted to evict Kaysar and Bayleigh is mad that she didn't vote for her friend Janelle when two others didn't, and she doesn't want them to think those votes were her</p>

<p>David: Cody still thinks it was Dani who voted for Kaysar but she keeps insisting it wasn't her, as everyone else comes in including David, who swears on his life that it wasn't him</p>

<p>Cody says in confession that 'one person in this room is definitely lying.'</p>

<p>David walks in and they think it was him, but he kind of plays dumb, as Da'vonne says she's 'over' his game.</p>

<p>Playing dumb: David walks in and they think it was him, but he kind of plays dumb, as Da'vonne says she's 'over' his game</p>

<p>Cody asks Enzo who did the vote, with Cody telling Enzo what Dani told her, Enzo said he's not telling anyone that he was the second vote.</p>

<p>Kaysar says that the first thing that comes up with Black people is their criminal record, with Da'vonne saying they use it to 'justify why they were killed.'</p>

<p>'At this point in time, my people, we're just tired,' Da'vonne said 'Who else has to die? I have brothers who are scared to go outside because they might be mistaken.'</p>

<p>She adds her license is great, her registration is great, and if a police officer gets behind her, she gets 'terrified.'</p>

<p>Justified: Kaysar says that the first thing that comes up with Black people is their criminal record, with Da'vonne saying they use it to 'justify why they were killed'</p>

<p>Mistaken: 'At this point in time, my people, we're just tired,' Da'vonne said 'Who else has to die? I have brothers who are scared to go outside because they might be mistaken'</p>

<p>Da'vonne adds that even with this game she has to 'adapt to an environment where no one else looks like me,' which clearly touches Kaysar.</p>

<p>Kaysar says that 'conversations like this are part of why I came back,' adding that he couldn't 'stand by and watch the world burn.'</p>

<p>Kaysar tells Da'vonne that he needs to be courageous enough to answer that call and he thinks this is important.</p>

<p>Adapt: Da'vonne adds that even with this game she has to 'adapt to an environment where no one else looks like me,' which clearly touches Kaysar</p>

<p>Enzo calls everyone to the living room to announce the have-nots.</p>

<p>Cody chats with Enzo, who is thinking about putting up Kaysar and a 'pawn,' but he doesn't indicate who the second might be.</p>

<p>Kaysar comes in to chat with Enzo, saying that he wants to make sure they're in good standing, adding he's a 'straight shooter.'</p>

<p>Kaysar makes it clear that he has Enzo's back, and he likes competitors, not 'floaters,' adding he wants to stick around as long as possible to have his back.</p>

<p>In confession, Kaysar says he feels 'cautiously optimistic,' though Enzo says he talked no game with him for four weeks and that means Enzo can't trust him.</p>

<p>Christmas is woken up in the middle of the night and told she has a tenth baby, and then later an 11th baby.</p>

<p>'I don't even understand what's happening,' she says in confession, as a 12th baby is 'born.'</p>

<p>The next day the announcer says the babies are all grown up now and can take care of themselves, as her punishment comes to an end.</p>

<p>Enzo pulls Christmas aside and says that he wants to work together, as Enzo says he'll be loyal to her if she'll be loyal to him.</p>

<p>'I need her, she's like my pitbull in this game,' Enzo says in confession, adding he has to figure out who he's putting up next to Kaysar.</p>

<p>No more babies: The next day the announcer says the babies are all grown up now and can take care of themselves, as her punishment comes to an end</p>

<p>They both wonder about Ian, who 'talks no game at all,' with Christmas saying he's 'very smart with the comps.'</p>

<p>Enzo says in confession that Ian has won this game, and he has his eye on him this week, though he hasn't made a decision yet.</p>

<p>'Your guess is as good as mine at this point,' Enzo says, with the Head of Household still clearly indecisive about the second player he's putting on the chopping block this week.</p>

<p>Smart: They both wonder about Ian, who 'talks no game at all,' with Christmas saying he's 'very smart with the comps'</p>

<p>Enzo gathers everyone for the nomination ceremony as they all sit around the large kitchen table.</p>

<p>Enzo says it's his responsibility to nominate two households for eviction, with the first houseguest nominated revealed to be Kaysar, which comes as no surprise to anyone.</p>

<p>The second nomination is Kevin, which clearly doesn't sit well with Kevin. Enzo says that it isn't personal, and he nominated them because they haven't talked any game with him and that's it.</p>

<p>Kevin says he's going to focus on winning the veto next, with Kaysar adding that him winning the veto is the only way he can survive.</p>

<p>Enzo admits in confession that Kevin is just a pawn and he's looking at everyone, so clearly no one should feel safe in the house, as the episode comes to a close.</p>
