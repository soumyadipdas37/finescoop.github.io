    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Dear Bel,</p>

<p>My Mum is 87 and has type 2 diabetes, heart failure and rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. She is housebound and has signs of dementia.</p>

<p>These conditions make her extremely vulnerable and I am very worried in case she picks up Covid-19. I am sad to say that I have not seen her since lockdown, although we speak regularly on the phone.</p>

<p>Luckily, my youngest sister lives with her husband a ten-minute walk away and visits Mum regularly and does her shopping.</p>

<p>Mum is independent and will not let anyone help if she can do it herself. I have two sisters and we agreed, between ourselves, that it made sense for our youngest sister to form a ‘support bubble’ with Mum and she was quite happy to do that.</p>

<p>We knew from the outset that we could be in this position for at least a year, but wanted to do everything to protect Mum from potential harm.</p>

<p>Now, however, it appears that the sister caring for my mum is bad-mouthing us to her for not visiting. I reckon she doesn’t believe there is a pandemic and tells us we are pathetic for staying away.</p>

<p>My daughters were upset they were also being criticised (on Facebook) for not visiting their gran.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to tell Mum, when I ring, that we would be breaking the law if we went into her house, especially as her area is under local restrictions. But she thinks it’s all rubbish and my sister has made her believe that no one else cares except for her.</p>

<p>Would these circumstances be classed as exceptional, or would I be breaking the law by visiting Mum? I don’t know what to do.</p>

<p>Judith </p>

<p>This week Bel answers a question about a daughter who wants to break lockdown rules to visit her frail 87-year-old mother</p>

<p>Some readers will think me the last person to answer this question, since a week ago I nailed my rebellious colours to the mast and rejected the Government’s latest Covid initiative, now known as the ‘rule of six’ (see today’s And Finally for more of what I think).</p>

<p>Nevertheless you asked and so I will attempt to reply — since this is about harmony within your family, as well as your mother’s welfare.</p>

<p>You give no details of where you and your mother and youngest sister live — or what their local restrictions are — so I cannot know what ‘law’ you would be breaking, or whether your circumstances would be ‘exceptional’.</p>

<p>Therefore, I can only deal with large instincts which, to me, take the form of putting the family first. Others do not feel that way — and they are, of course, entitled to their views.</p>

<p>You say you haven’t seen your mother since the beginning of lockdown and that makes you ‘sad’. Is that because you feel guilty?</p>

<p>During lockdown many people did visit their elderly parents (not in care homes) and stood several yards away from them, being seen, having a chat and making them feel loved.</p>

<p>Nothing could have stopped me from acting in this way. You will know why you didn’t — and I totally sympathise with your confusion.</p>

<p>But what remains is your mother’s inability to understand what she sees as neglect, as well as your sister’s anger.</p>

<p>You and your non-visiting sister need to have a proper talk (on Zoom or FaceTime?) with your carer sister as soon as possible — not to berate her for ‘bad-mouthing’ you, but to express your gratitude that she is caring for Mum and ask what you can do to make things better.</p>

<p>You could also ask if she could help your mother to FaceTime or WhatsApp, since it would be so much more pleasing than phone calls and she could see your daughters, too. If your sister just says, ‘Get in the car and come and visit’, ask her for proper clarification on the local issue.</p>

<p>As for me, I would go and visit — in the belief that, at 87 and in a poor state of health, your mother might think a socially distanced sight of her family (before winter hits — and maybe a return to total lockdown) more important than fear of catching the virus.</p>

<p>That is certainly what my own mother, who is 96, thinks and (I repeat) no power in the world will keep me away from the parents who need my husband and me. But, in the end, these are personal decisions.</p>

<p>I just hope you can make your mother feel better — and by so doing, yourself, too.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Can I tell my daughter she is dangerously fat?  </p>

<p>Dear Bel,</p>

<p>At 77, I am happy living alone. I have three grandsons who live far away, so I usually see them about twice a year.</p>

<p>I have two daughters. One of them is 47 and slim, but my other daughter is as wide as she is tall and that is my problem — how to talk to her about it. She is 43, about 5ft 6in and weighs about 18 st 12 lb.</p>

<p>She has a degree in accountancy and a very good job. As far as I know she is happy living with a partner who appears worldly and kind, but, alas, they have no children.</p>

<p>With your wisdom, common sense, tact and know-how, I wonder if you can advise me about my concerns over her health.</p>

<p>How do I say without hurting her feelings that her weight is probably leading her to an early demise?</p>

<p>Is it possible that any loving effort on my part might alienate her? I don’t know what to do.</p>

<p>Matthew</p>

<p>This issue crops up regularly in the news in terms of guidelines for medical professionals. Should they ever use the words ‘obese’ or (worse) ‘fat’?</p>

<p>Is it even right to suggest that a patient is overweight — when obviously that condition will have a detrimental effect on health?</p>

<p>Come let us pity those who are better off than we are</p>

<p>Come my friend and remember</p>

<p>That the rich have butlers and no friends,</p>

<p>And we have friends and no butlers.</p>

<p>Ezra Pound (U.S. poet and critic, 1885-1972)</p>

<p>I’m afraid I’m old school. If my GP (back when I could see one) could tell me that I should cut down on alcohol, why is it unacceptable to suggest a man or woman cut down on food in order to attain a healthy weight?</p>

<p>Obesity is a national crisis that needs to be tackled. But within the family . . . I’m not so sure.</p>

<p>Your concern for your daughter is clearly sincere, but should you speak to her? Is she likely to take offence and feel alienated?</p>

<p>I suspect she would. Worse, would she think you unkind and be terribly hurt on hearing the truth from your lips? Probably. This is such a hard issue, with tact and kindness all important. We have to weigh the sincerity of our feelings against the possible price of honesty. To speak your mind, even if motivated by a loving heart, can cause harsh words and even an unbridgeable rift.</p>

<p>In any case, would an adult daughter, a professional woman, be likely to listen to the wisdom of her old dad? Somehow I doubt it.</p>

<p>Do you get on with her partner? Might it be possible to speak to him, expressing your worries — and mentioning the real danger Covid-19 presents to the obese? You could ask — stressing absolute confidence — whether she has any underlying reasons for her weight, and whether she has tried any sort of diet.</p>

<p>He may say she is happy as she is — and so is he. If that’s the case, there’s nothing you can do. But if her partner shares your anxiety, he would be the person to speak to her. In the end, we parents have to accept the limitation of what we can say to adult children.</p>

<p>My first family has cut me off </p>

<p>Dear Bel</p>

<p>I have been widowed twice, have no children and have been on my own for seven years. Still, I have lots of friends and hobbies.</p>

<p>With my first husband came two stepchildren. They didn’t live with us, but visited often. Three years after my husband died I met and married my second husband, but wondered then if I should have postponed the wedding.</p>

<p>My stepfamily did not want me to get re-married, so it made me feel very guilty starting again with another person. Then my stepfamily told me they did not want to see me again. I have not heard from them for a long time. I tried to write a couple of times, with no response.</p>

<p>A pseudonym will be used if you wish.</p>

<p>Bel reads all letters but regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I have remembered them in my will. Life is too short and fragile to become bitter, and I believe we need to care for one another now, especially through these uncertain times.</p>

<p>Do you agree with me? I have been thinking about it all a lot lately.</p>

<p>FREDA</p>

<p>Thank you so much for expressing an attitude to life that lifts my heart. There is so much anger and bitterness all around that reading the quiet wisdom you share is a much-needed antidote.</p>

<p>As you describe it, your decision to marry again after three years of widowhood was perfectly reasonable — and it’s very sad that those stepchildren chose anger and alienation, instead of being glad you could find happiness again. They were surely in the wrong and their rejection must have been very hurtful indeed.</p>

<p>That makes it all the more impressive that you have remembered them in your will. I hope that when the time comes your generosity will light a flame in their hearts, to illuminate memories of good times they shared with you when they were young.</p>

<p>It’s all we can do, isn’t it? Hope, I mean. Try to do the best we can and appreciate what we have. Your example shines.</p>

<p> And finally... This ‘cure’ for the virus is a curse</p>

<p>Life gets tougher. The suicide rate is up, people are dying for lack of hospital treatment for conditions that kill more than Covid, the nation is turning to drink and winter is on the way.</p>

<p>There’s a pandemic of loneliness and depression, fuelled by all of the above, plus the feeling of frustration and abandonment when you can’t get through to your GP surgery to book the flu jab you need. I’m one of many trying for three weeks now.</p>

<p>Then there’s the testing scandal. A young friend’s little daughter, two days into school in London for the first time, had a tiny little cough. Naturally, her parents thought she should be tested.</p>

<p>After 36 hours of hunting one down, an email came offering a test in Inverness. And we are supposed to keep sane?</p>

<p>Now let me share an innocent moment. We live on a farm-homestead, our house plus three cottages converted by previous owners from farm buildings. One is the holiday let my husband runs (empty all summer, of course).</p>

<p>My son’s cottage contains the four of them and adjoining it is the home rented by my daughter-in-law’s close friend Sarah, a divorced mum-of-one.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful afternoon, so I strolled up to chat to the two girls outside Sarah’s door. With the three children playing there, we immediately made six. Ten minutes later, a car pulled up and out stepped their chum from the village, all smiles to see me, full of warm (socially distanced) greetings.</p>

<p>At that moment my husband, gardening nearby, stepped up to say hello, too. So we became eight. So friendly in the sunshine . . . yet we could be reported to the authorities by any busybody peering over the wall, as if this were Communist Romania, terrified into submission by the Securitate.</p>

<p>That’s where we are. A deluge of emails responding to my article last week rejecting the ‘rule of six’ and its possible impact on family Christmases dubbed me a hero and a zero. I remain firmly convinced the ‘cure’ is a curse.</p>
