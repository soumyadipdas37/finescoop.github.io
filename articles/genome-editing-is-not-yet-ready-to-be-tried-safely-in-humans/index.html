        <p>Editing the genes of embryos is not yet safe for humans, according to a new report published by the world's leading experts in fertility, ethics and biology. </p>

<p>Germline gene editing is a process where faulty, diseased, or undesirable genes in an embryo, sperm of egg are removed, altered or replaced by scientists. </p>

<p>This system is extremely powerful and the changes made are not only permanent, but will be passed down the generations. </p>

<p>However, this landmark report says not enough is known about the safety or precision of the process for it to be trialled in humans. </p>

<p>Advocates of human germline genome editing are pushing for the procedure to be investigated, as it has the ability to allow babies destined to inherit life-threatening conditions to be born disease-free. </p>

<p>The topic of gene editing embryos to 'customise' a baby has been at the forefront of science since the shock announcement in 2018 that a rogue scientist in China had used the powerful gene-editing tool Crispr on a pair of twin girls. </p>

<p>Currently, editing the DNA of a human embryo is not allowed in the US, thanks to a 2017 ruling by the international committee of the National Academy of Sciences. </p>

<p>Crispr-based experiments on human embryos were approved in the UK in 2016 with the stipulation they are never transplanted to create a pregnancy and must be destroyed after a week.  </p>

<p>Scroll down for video  </p>

<p>The world's leading experts in fertility, ethics and biology have published a report stating editing the genes of embryos is not yet safe for humans (stock)</p>

<p>Heritable human genome editing (HHGE) is when the DNA of a human embryo, sperm or egg is deliberately altered to influence the characteristics of a future individual.</p>

<p>Heritable genome edits can be passed down to future generations, raising scientific and medical considerations, as well as ethical, moral, and societal issues.</p>

<p>It could in theory be used to eradicate the risk of inherited diseases. </p>

<p>But it could also be employed for other reasons, such as creating designer babies. </p>

<p>For example, parents could use the technique to select for genes which will make their child smarter, taller, stronger and have blue eyes, if they wish. </p>

<p>However, many of these traits are highly complex and controlled by more than a single gene, which muddies the waters when it comes to being able to safely negotiate what can be switched out, and what can not. </p>

<p>The side-effects are simply unknown and could result in lifelong issues for the baby. These changes would not die with them, as they would be passed on to any offspring they have as well.  </p>

<p>Since the invention and development of Crispr-Cas9 around 15 years ago, a prevailing problem has been a lack of understanding of how safe the procedure is in the long-term. </p>

<p>The definitive response provided by the report is that these questions can not be safely answered and therefore it can not be approved for human use. </p>

<p>The report has been published by the US National Academy of Medicine, US National Academy of Sciences, and the UK's Royal Society. </p>

<p>It says the technique should not be used to create a pregnancy until it is proved that precise changes can be made without introducing undesired changes. </p>

<p>He Jiankui was internationally condemned for gene-editing twin girl Lulu and Nana when he blatantly flouted the existing legislation. </p>

<p>A full-length piece of research from He has never before been published or verified, but excerpts were obtained and published by MIT Technology Review. </p>

<p>Experts who reviewed the extracts have called the work 'delusional', 'outrageous' and 'preposterous'. </p>

<p>Researchers Haoyi Wang and Hui Yang, both well-known experts in the field of gene editing, also penned an opinion piece in the well-respected scientific journal Plos Biology, comprehensively dismantling the science behind his work. </p>

<p>They say the procedure was not only morally reprehensible and far beyond the scope of any ethical consideration, but also that his scientific method was lax and took unnecessary risks. </p>

<p>In the new report, the authors state that the potential side-effects and risks are simply too great in the vast majority of cases. </p>

<p>The only case in which clinicians should currently consider the process is for serious diseases caused by a single faulty gene that significantly impact morbidity and cause premature death and make it impossible for parents to have a healthy child that is biologically related to them. </p>

<p>Examples of these diseases include cystic fibrosis, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and Tay-Sachs disease, the report says. </p>

<p>These fall into category A, as defined by the report, which the authors say will likely only include a 'modest' number of families worledie, likely less than 20. </p>

<p>However, a sub-set of category B, where two parents with dominant genes which result in a single gene genetic mutation, such as Huntington's, should also be considered. </p>

<p>In this group, there are likely thousands of families worldwide, the academics who wrote the report say. </p>

<p>This is because the issue can be completely removed by changing just one gene. However, other conditions and diseases are caused by myriad genes, known as polygenic. </p>

<p>Risk of obesity, cancer and diabetes, for example, are all polygenic traits, which could be changed with HHGE but would be far higher risk than the single-gene diseases. </p>

<p>Ethical experts have also long debated if the tool would be misused to create so-called designer babies that are tailored to the desires of their parents. </p>

<p>For example, parents could alter the genes of their unborn baby to make them taller or more muscular than they would have been naturally. </p>

<p>Other polygenic features which could be manipulated include academic ability and eye colour.</p>

<p>However, the report rules these firmly out of the equation.  </p>

<p>The report describes a translational pathway for initial clinical use of HHGE for single-gene diseases such as cystic fibrosis. </p>

<p>It identifies a number of requirements that must be met to demonstrate the embryos have been properly edited. </p>

<p>This must be made on extensive preclinical testing and should be checked before authorisation is given to establish a pregnancy. </p>

<p>Altered embryos should also be tested to ensure their growth and development is as expected and the editing has not inhibited their normal  progression.   </p>

<p>The report also states that any embryos going through this process must have a biopsy to ensure the edit has worked properly and is found in all cells and tissues and no unintended edits have snuck in. </p>

<p>Montorign, the experts say, is vital in order to get the procedure regulatory approval.    </p>

<p>Additionally, research should continue to evaluate the potential use of stem cells in producing functional human eggs or sperm, the report says.</p>

<p>This technique could reduce or eliminate the need for genome editing at the time of or after fertilisation, researchers explain.</p>

<p>However, this type of HHGE should also be carefully evaluated, as it raises its own distinct medical, ethical, and societal issues, the experts say.</p>

<p>It describes the few cases when HHGE might be considered.</p>

<p>These are when, without the procedure, prospective parents at known risk of transmitting a serious monogenic disease have no option or extremely poor options for having a biologically-related child who is not genetically affected.</p>

<p>Commission co-chairman, Richard Lifton, president of the Rockefeller University, New York City, said: 'Any initial uses of HHGE should proceed incrementally and cautiously, and provide the most favourable balance of potential benefits and harms.'</p>

<p>The commission has created a 'responsible clinical translational pathway' from various non-human trials that will be used to if and how editing should be used on single-gene diseases.  </p>

<p>However, it said it is not possible to define responsible translational pathways from research to clinical application for other potential uses of HHGE.</p>

<p>It adds that the uses, circumstances, and considerations differ widely, as do the technical advances that would be needed to make additional clinical uses feasible.</p>

<p>Commission co-chairwoman, Kay Davies, professor of genetics at the MDUK Oxford Neuromuscular Centre at the University of Oxford, said: 'Should they ever be used, it is vitally important that these technologies are used for medically justified interventions, based on a rigorous understanding of how the pathogenic variant leads to disease.</p>

<p>'More research is needed into the technology of genome editing in human embryos, to ensure that precise changes can be made without undesired off-target effects.</p>

<p>'International cooperation and open discussion of all aspects of genome editing will be essential.'</p>

<p>Currently, there is no global legislation controlling the use of gene editing - a grey area exposed by the He Jiankui scandal. </p>

<p>Instead, it is often a set of disjointed rules and restrictions implemented by individual countries or states, which differ internationally.  </p>

<p>The report also calls for improvements in this regard and wants an independent body to be established. </p>

<p>These world-leading experts will be tasked with continuously assessing the state of the scientific evidence and laying out guidance accordingly. </p>

<p>He Jiankui speaks during an interview at a laboratory in Shenzhen in southern China's Guangdong province. The Chinese scientist claims he helped make world's first genetically edited babies: Twin girls whose DNA he claims to have altered</p>

<p>The commission which released this report was established as the world reeled from the shocking revelations of He Jiankui at the 2018 International Summit on Human Genome Editing held in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>At the summit, a researcher from China announced that twins had been born following editing he had performed on early embryos, despite broad agreement in the scientific and clinical communities that it was premature and irresponsible to undertake heritable human genome editing.</p>

<p>The commission's goal was to define specific criteria and standards that would be required before HHGE could be considered for clinical use and avoid a repeat of the scandal. </p>

<p>Dr He stunned the world when he announced the use of gene-editing technology CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls, nicknamed 'Lulu' and 'Nana'.</p>

<p>The disgraced researcher's justification for the experiment was to confer HIV immunity to the embryos in later life. </p>

<p>Many reports claimed this was due to the father being HIV-positive. This is false, as the father's HIV status was neutralised using a long-established technique called sperm washing. </p>

<p>Being HIV positive carries a significant social stigma in China and makes it almost impossible to have access to fertility treatment.</p>

<p>Sperm washing prevents the infection from being passed on to unborn children but can often result in exclusion from fertility treatment.</p>

<p>By targeting HIV-positive families, He may have motivated the parents to take part in the experiment despite the huge risks to their children, Jeanne O'Brien, a reproductive endocrinologist at Shady Grove Fertility told the MIT Technology Review.   </p>

<p>Dr He has since been fired from his university post and is under investigation by Chinese authorities.</p>

<p>Scientists around the world were quick to condemn Dr He's experiments when news of them emerged.</p>

<p>He, along with nine listed co-authors, proclaims his work as a 'success' and goes as far as to say it 'will bring new hope to millions of families seeking healthy babies free from inherited or acquired life-threatening diseases.' </p>

<p>Dr Helen O'Neill of the University College London was present when the controversial scientists gave a speech on his widely criticised research at the 2018 International Summit on Human Genome Editing held in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The esteemed lecturer in reproductive and molecular genetics said the beleaguered Chinese researcher 'gave quite an impressive presentation on quite extensive and thorough research'. </p>

<p>At the summit, Mr Jiankui also revealed that he is testing the gene-editing tool on a woman who is in the early stages of pregnancy.</p>

<p>There has been no further news of this purported pregnancy, except for claims the gene-edited child has been born.  </p>

<p>This graphic reveals how, theoretically, an embryo could be 'edited' using the powerful tool Crispr-Cas9 to defend humans against HIV infection</p>

<p>The disgraced researcher used gene-editing technology CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls nicknamed 'Lulu' and 'Nana'.</p>

<p>Dr He's justification for the experiment was to confer HIV immunity to the embryos to avoid infection from the father, who is HIV positive. </p>

<p>He has since been fired from his university post and is under investigation from Chinese authorities.    </p>

<p>Academics who reviewed the paper's extracts say this likely failed unwittingly inputted potentially dangerous mutations into the genomes of the twins, Lulu and Nana.  </p>

<p>The gene Dr He edited is called CCR5, and it is involved in regulating the body's immune system.  </p>

<p>He sought to disable CCR5, which forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.</p>

<p>Sarah Norcross, director of the Progress Educational Trust, a charity which aims to give people suffering from infertility or genetic conditions more choice, called these heinous and reckless experiments 'lamentable, both scientifically and ethically'. </p>

<p>She also believes the report is too stringent in its recommendations, which were made to prevent unborn children suffering a life littered with potential genetic flaws.   </p>

<p>'The criteria the report sets out, for the first acceptable clinical use of germline genome editing in humans, are far too narrow,' she says. </p>

<p>'Furthermore, the report strays beyond its scientific remit. Much of the report – including a third of its recommendations – concerns governance, which is the focus of a separate genome editing project by the World Health Organisation.</p>

<p>'The World Health Organisation is still deliberating on the governance of genome editing, and should not feel constrained by this report's governance recommendations if it sees fit to deviate from them.' </p>

<p>CRISPR-Cas9 is a tool for making precise edits in DNA, discovered in bacteria.</p>

<p>The acronym stands for 'Clustered Regularly Inter-Spaced Palindromic Repeats'.</p>

<p>The technique involves a DNA cutting enzyme and a small tag which tells the enzyme where to cut.</p>

<p>The CRISPR/Cas9 technique uses tags which identify the location of the mutation, and an enzyme, which acts as tiny scissors, to cut DNA in a precise place, allowing small portions of a gene to be removed</p>

<p>By editing this tag, scientists are able to target the enzyme to specific regions of DNA and make precise cuts, wherever they like.</p>

<p>It has been used to 'silence' genes - effectively switching them off.</p>

<p>When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA.</p>

<p>In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome.</p>

<p>The approach has been used previously to edit the HBB gene responsible for a condition called β-thalassaemia. </p>
