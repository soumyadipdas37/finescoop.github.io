        <p>They are some of the most notorious addresses in Britain - and the two houses where serial killer Dennis Nilsen slaughtered and cut up his victims are still standing today.</p>

<p>One of the Scottish-born criminal's flats, in Cricklewood, north London, which was home to Nilsen when he carried out 12 of his estimated 15 murders in the late 1970s and early 80s, was even bought for nearly half a million pound in 2016.</p>

<p>The buyers, named only as Bruno and Mathilde, revealed in 2018 how they had transformed the property into their dream home - insisting that they were not put off by its gory history and were proud of how they turned the 'house of horrors' into a comfortable abode. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the flat in Cranley Gardens, Muswell Hill, where the Job Centre worker killed three of his victims, was last sold for £285,000 in 2015 - unbelievably making a £35,000 profit from its 2013 price.</p>

<p>The horrific story of Nilsen, who died at the age of 74 in 2018 at HMP Full Sutton, 34 years into his life sentence, is being told in Des, a chilling new three-part drama from ITV this week - with the first episode having aired yesterday to high praise from viewers.   </p>

<p>They are some of the most notorious addresses in Britain - and the two houses where serial killer Dennis Nilsen slaughtered and cut up his victims are still standing today. Pictured, Flat in Cranley Gardens, Muswell Hill</p>

<p>One of the Scottish-born criminal's flats, in Cricklewood (pictured), north London, which was home to Nilsen when he carried out 12 of his estimated 15 murders in the late 1970s and early 80s, was even bought for nearly half a million pound in 2016</p>

<p>The horrific story of Nilsen (pictured), who died at the age of 74 in 2018 at HMP Full Sutton, 34 years into his life sentence, is being told in Des, a chilling new three-part drama from ITV this week - with the first episode having aired yesterday to high praise from viewers</p>

<p>Nilsen, who is played by Broadchurch and Doctor Who star David Tennant in the series, was charged with murder after his drains at Muswell Hill had been found to be blocked with human remains.</p>

<p>Dubbed the Muswell Hill Murderer, Nilsen immediately confessed to as many as 15 murders – he couldn't be quite sure – after being questioned by police in 1983.</p>

<p>During his killing spree, Nilsen would befriend his subjects in pubs and bars in London before luring them into his flat, first in Melrose Avenue, Cricklewood, and later in Cranley Gardens, where he would murder them and sit with their corpses before dismembering them. </p>

<p>He stored many of their bodies beneath the floorboards of his homes before burying them in the garden or cutting them up and flushing them down the drains.</p>

<p>But despite the grisly past Nilsen's former London houses share - they both remain standing and have been bought for hundreds of thousands of pounds. </p>

<p>In 2018, a couple revealed how they transformed the Cricklewood flat into their dream home - insisting that they were not put off by its gory history and are proud of how they turned the 'house of horrors' into a comfortable abode. </p>

<p>In 2018, a couple revealed how they transformed the Cricklewood flat (pictured) into their dream home - insisting that they were not put off by its gory history and are proud of how they turned the 'house of horrors' into a comfortable abode</p>

<p>The flat in Cranley Gardens, Muswell Hill (pictured in 2017), where the Job Centre worker killed three of his victims, was last sold for £285,000 in 2015 - unbelievably making a £35,000 profit from its 2013 price</p>

<p>The house was bought by a NHS manager from Portugal and his French-born partner for £493,000 in 2016.</p>

<p>The couple, named only as Bruno and Mathilde, told The Sun: 'We know a lot of people would not live here. But from the moment people see what the place looks like, it puts that to rest.</p>

<p>'If you compare what the flat was with what the flat is, it has nothing to do with what happened 35 years ago.'</p>

<p>They admitted they did not know about the flat's past when they viewed it, but the estate agent had advised them to Google the address.</p>

<p>They added: 'We looked it up and read all about the history. But it was all 35, 40 years ago. For us it was never an issue.'</p>

<p>Nilsen is believed to have killed as many as 15 men, most of them homeless. He is pictured during a TV interview in 1993 </p>

<p>Nilsen (right), with a prison warden at his side, after he was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years imprisonment after being convicted of six murders and two attempted murders at the Old Bailey</p>

<p>Dennis Nilsen killed at least 15 men over a period of six years in London in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>

<p>Most of his victims were homosexual or homeless men who he would pick up in bars across London or on the street.</p>

<p>After inviting them to his home, Nilsen would ply his victims with food and alcohol before killing then. His preferred method was strangulation.</p>

<p>Once dead, he dismembered their bodies by dissecting them in his house. In his first address, Melrose Avenue, he buried their remains in the garden. In Cranley Gardens however he was forced to take other measures.</p>

<p>Once arrested he told police how he boiled the heads of his victims in a large cooking pot to dispose of their brains.</p>

<p>He would cut up the rest of their bodies and store them in plastic bin bags at the property. When the stench of their rotting corpses became stronger, he tried to flush their limbs down the toilet and drains.</p>

<p>This caused a large blockage in the pipes. Seemingly oblivious to risk, Nilsen audaciously complained to a waste company about the blockage and asked for it to be resolved because he and other residents were suffering as a result.</p>

<p>When a worker Dyno-Rod arrived at the property in 1983 to unblock them, he discovered what appeared to be flesh and fragments of bone when he opened a drain cover outside the property.</p>

<p>The following day, after inspecting another section of pipe, he and his supervisor discovered what they thought were bones of a human hand.</p>

<p>They alerted police who arrested Nilsen as he returned home from work. While in custody he admitted to killing at least 15 people.</p>

<p>The couple ripped up the old floorboards and replaced them with modern wooden flooring and smartened up the garden where Nilsen's victims' bodies once lay. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to Rightmove, the flat in Muswell Hill was last sold in August 2015 for £285,000, a £30,000 price increase from its £250,000 sale in October 2013.</p>

<p>In 2017, the north London flat went on the market for around £500,000 - but it is unclear if it was ever snapped up at that price.</p>

<p>The property was on the market for more than £30,000 above the average price of a home in the area, according to Zoopla.</p>

<p>Although it had to be knocked down from the original asking price of £525,000 after it failed to sell.</p>

<p>Viewers have been left gobsmacked by David Tennant's Dennis Nilsen calmly admitting to murdering '15 or 16, I think' men in ITV's chilling new three-part drama Des. </p>

<p>The programme, which aired last night, follows the real-life story of one of the nation's most notorious killers, Nilsen, also known as the Muswell Hill Murderer. </p>

<p>In tonight's episode, the mild-mannered Job Centre worker, played by Broadchurch and Doctor Who star David Tennant, was charged with murder after his drains had been found to be blocked with human remains. </p>

<p>To the shock of viewers, Scottish-born Nilsen immediately confessed to as many as 15 murders – he couldn't be quite sure – while sitting in the back of the police car, with one viewer commenting: 'Des 15 or 16 I think!!! Picking jaw up off the floor! I'm on the edge of my seat already!'  </p>

<p>Viewers took to Twitter to share their shock to see Scottish-born Nilsen chillingly confess to killing '15 or 16' people within the first 15 minutes of the ITV series</p>

<p>Another shocked viewer said: '"One body or two?", "Fifteen or sixteen". Answered as if he'd been asked how many sugars he wanted in his tea,' while third added: 'How is he casually admitting. man said "a relief" #Des.'</p>

<p>At the start of the episode, Nilsen was cornered by police - including Detective Inspector Peter Jay (played by Line of Duty star Daniel Mays) - after human bones were discovered in the drain outside his home. </p>

<p>Despite initially questioning why the officers were interrogating him, Nilsen, who was a former police officer and trade unionist, soon confessed and even pointed the police in the direction of more bodies. </p>

<p>When an officer asked: 'So we talking about one body or two?,' Nilsen replied: '15 or 16, I think.'</p>
