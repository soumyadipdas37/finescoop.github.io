        <p>Katie Price poked fun at her 18-month driving ban as she showed off her new personalised scooter in a YouTube clip shared on Monday.</p>

<p>The ex-glamour model, 42, joked about 'getting a brilliant pair of wheels', just under a year after she was charged with withholding the name of the driver when her Range Rover was involved in a collision in November 2018.</p>

<p>Following her horrific accident during a recent holiday in Turkey, the media personality enthused she fulfilled her 'dream' by getting the vehicle, which features her surname as its registration plate.</p>

<p>'My new wheels!' Katie Price poked fun at her 18-month driving ban as she showed off her new personalised scooter in a YouTube clip shared on Monday</p>

<p>Joined by her daughter Princess, 13, Katie sat in her monogrammed pushchair as she prepared to pick up her mobility aid.</p>

<p>The reality star said: 'It's like a dream today for me, not only have I spent the day with my gorgeous girl, it's the arrival of my new wheels!'</p>

<p>Focusing on the brighter side of things, the mother-of-five added: 'I'm banned from driving, stuff that, I might not be able to legally drive on the road or use my legs but it hasn't stopped me from getting a brilliant pair of wheels.'</p>

<p>The TV star reunited with car valet Robbie Orlando, who previously claimed she duped him out of paying for work with the offer of publicity.</p>

<p>Wow-factor! The former glamour model, 42, enthused she fulfilled her 'dream' by getting the vehicle, which features her surname as its registration plate</p>

<p>In good company: Joined by her daughter Princess, 13, the reality star sat in her monogrammed pushchair as she prepared to pick up her mobility aid</p>

<p>Brushing aside drama: The media personality joked about 'getting a brilliant pair of wheels', just under a year after she was banned from driving for a fourth time in two years </p>

<p>In October 2018, he alleged his company Valet Magic styled a pink Barbie-style wrap on her Suzuki jeep and vowed to include footage in her Quest Red reality show Katie Price: My Crazy Life, although the scenes never hit screens. </p>

<p>Proving they'be buried the hatchet, the former Page 3 star said: 'Look at that and the number plate! You have got to look at the back. Robbie did my Jeep, I'm going to clear this up. I've always got on with him. There was history, we've made up.'</p>

<p>Katie revealed they plan to team up again in the near future as she added: 'He's going to be doing my car, a pink Ferrari with hearts and Barbie - tacky as f***. I also want a Range Rover in December.'</p>

<p>Together again: The TV star reunited with car valet Robbie Orlando, who previously claimed she duped him out of paying for work with the offer of publicity</p>

<p>Awkward! In October 2018, Robbie alleged his company styled a pink Barbie-style wrap on her Suzuki jeep and vowed to include footage in her show, although the scenes never hit screens </p>

<p>The businessman's eldest daughter was impressed by the scooter as she admitted: 'I want one of these so I can drive to school!'</p>

<p>The Brighton native later showed Robbie a picture of her injury and updated viewers on her recovery.</p>

<p>'They [doctors] reckon it'll be two years before I can walk again', the blonde explained. </p>

<p>She recently revealed she was stepping out of the spotlight on medical advice as she has been told to 'rest in order to heal'. </p>

<p> October 3, 2003</p>

<p>Escaped a speeding charge on a technicality after cops failed to arrest her within 12 weeks. Her Range Rover was allegedly clocked at 70mph in a 40mph zone.</p>

<p>June 5, 2008</p>

<p>Given three penalty points, fined £200 and ordered to pay £80 costs at Feltham magistrates' court for talking on her mobile phone while driving on April 18 that year.</p>

<p>January 7, 2009</p>

<p>Let off on a legal technicality by Brighton magistrates after allegedly breaking a 30mph limit and not providing the identity of the driver to police.</p>

<p>July 7, 2010</p>

<p>Convicted in her absence by Crawley magistrates after cameras caught her speeding at 99 mph on September 16, 2009.</p>

<p>Her lawyer argued she was only speeding because she was being hounded by the paparazzi, but police said there were no other speeding vehicles around.</p>

<p>She was fined £250, ordered to pay £500 prosecution costs and given four points on her licence.</p>

<p>September 28, 2010</p>

<p>Convicted at Mid-Sussex Magistrates' Court for failing to be in proper control of her 7.5-ton lurid pink horsebox after veering into another lane in Sussex on February 19.</p>

<p>She was fined £1,000, ordered to pay £650 court costs and a £15 victim surcharge and given three points on her licence, taking her tally to ten.</p>

<p>December 1, 2010</p>

<p>Banned from driving ban for six months after she was caught on speed camera travelling at 83mph in a 70mph zone on the A23 in Pyecombe, West Sussex on 10 December 2009.</p>

<p>Katie, who did not attend the hearing, pleaded guilty to the charge.</p>

<p>In her absence, she was fined £1,000 and given three penalty points on her license (taking her total at that time to 13 points).</p>

<p>This took her over the 12-point limit and brought an automatic six-month driving ban and so she was disqualified from driving for six months.</p>

<p>August 31, 2012</p>

<p>Barred from driving on the roads for 12 months, after failing to respond to two speeding tickets.</p>

<p>She had been caught speeding in London on September 5 and September 6 2011.</p>

<p>The glamour model argued that all of her post was dealt with by her mother and she had never seen the prosecution warnings.</p>

<p>Katie, who already had six points on her licence at the time, was given six more and banned for 12 months. She was also fined £400.</p>

<p>February 16, 2018</p>

<p>Banned from driving for six months after doing 60mph on the 50mph A24. She already had points on her license.</p>

<p>Following the incident in Dial Post, West Sussex in 2017, Katie failed to tell police when the speeding ticket arrived and was charged with failing to provide details about the person driving.</p>

<p>She failed to show up at magistrates' court and was given a six-month ban and a £750 fine.</p>

<p>July 28, 2018</p>

<p>In July she was was questioned by police after photographs emerged of her getting behind the wheel of her car while still banned from the road.</p>

<p>Pictures revealed Katie driving her grey Ford Fiesta home from Gatwick with her youngest kids Jett, aged four, and Bunny, aged three.</p>

<p>She handed herself into police and took to Instagram to insist that she thought the ban was over - but as soon as she realised it wasn't, confessed her wrongdoing to authorities to avoid a 'guilty conscience.'</p>

<p>The former glamour model said at the time: 'After driving to Harvey's Hospital appointment I have NOW found out that I don't get my licence back until 8th August.'</p>

<p>September 26, 2018</p>

<p>Crashed her £63,000 Ranger Rover on September 26, while allegedly on her mobile phone. The crash was reported to the police.</p>

<p>Marketing executive Katie Pugh, 23, told MailOnline that the troubled star rear-ended her Mercedes as they were stuck in traffic on the A3 in Roehampton, Surrey.</p>

<p>Pugh said she looked up into her rear-view mirror and noticed Katie appearing to be looking at her phone moments before the collision at around 5.30PM on September 26.</p>

<p>October 10, 2018</p>

<p>Arrested on suspicion of drink-driving in the earlier hours of the morning on October 10, after being found by police in her garish pink Range Rover in Woolwich, East London.</p>

<p>Katie had allegedly been partying with ex-boyfriend Kris Boyson helping him celebrate his 30th birthday when her car ended up hitting a parked car.</p>

<p>She took a roadside breath test and was taken to Plumstead Police station where she was released after a night in the cells.</p>

<p>Katie was then photographed driving her car without wearing her seatbelt, just 36 hours after her drink driving arrest - an infraction that carries a £100 fine.</p>

<p>December 2018</p>

<p>Charged by postal requisition over her drink-driving charge and was due to appear at Bromley Magistrates' Court on Monday, 7 January.</p>

<p>January 2019 </p>

<p>Caught driving while disqualified, without third party insurance - ordered to pay £1,000 and banned for a further three months.</p>

<p>February 2019</p>

<p>Convicted of being drunk (more than twice legal limit) in charge of her vehicle and banned from driving for three months.</p>

<p>Claimed a mystery man had been driving.</p>

<p>October 2019</p>

<p>Price is banned from the roads after withholding the name of the driver. </p>

<p>Given a £440 fine, a £44 surcharge and ordered to pay £100 in costs.</p>

<p>The statement read: 'Katie is taking some time out of the media spotlight. Her family and Dr's have told Katie that she must rest in order to heal. Katie wants to thank everyone for their ongoing support and will be back when she feels ready.'     </p>

<p>Katie's representative added to MailOnline: 'Katie is taking a much needed break. Katie has found the past few weeks terribly draining, both mentally and physically challenging and in order to bounce back is convalescing.' </p>
