        <p>Donald Trump wanted his inauguration to resemble a North Korean military parade while Ivanka Trump wanted to host a ball with actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a new book claims.</p>

<p>'I want tanks and choppers. Make it look like North Korea,' the president-elect told Stephanie Winston Wolkoff of his inauguration, according to her new book 'Melania &amp; Me.'</p>

<p>Wolkoff was instrumental in planning the January 2017 swearing-in ceremony, the parade and surrounding celebrations for Trump's presidency and had close contact with the Trump family about their vision for the day.</p>

<p>In her book, out Tuesday but a copy of which was obtained by DailyMail.com, she reveals Trump and his family had several ideas on how to celebrate Trump's presidential victory, not all of which came to fruition. </p>

<p>The White House has disputed much that is in the book, arguing Wolkoff has some 'imagined need for revenge.'  </p>

<p>'Anybody who secretly tapes their self-described best friend is by definition, dishonest,' Stephanie Grisham, Melania Trump's chief of staff, told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'The book is not only full of mistruths and paranoia, it it is based on some imagined need for revenge. Wolkoff builds herself up while belittling and blaming everyone she worked with, yet she still managed to be the victim. Sadly, this is a deeply insecure woman who's need to be relevant defies logic.'</p>

<p>Donald Trump wanted his inauguration to resemble a North Korean military parade with 'tanks and choppers,' a new book claims</p>

<p>Stephanie Winston Wolkoff's memoir 'Melania &amp; Me' paints an unflattering portrait of Ivanka Trump and what Wolkoff says was her desire to run the inauguration</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump's wanted to hold an Environmental Ball with Leonardo DiCaprio at the National Portrait Gallery, which did not happen</p>

<p>President Trump did not get a military parade at his inauguration on January 20, 2017 </p>

<p>President Trump has sought to open relations between the United States and North Korea; above he and Kim Jong Un stand at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas on June 30, 2019</p>

<p>Trump, while in office, has sought to open relations between the United States and North Korea. He's met with leader Kim Jong Un and traveled to the demilitarized zone with him. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wolkoff was one of many working on inauguration plans along with Tom Barrack, the businessman heading the inaugural committee and its fundraising, and Mark Burnett, the producer of 'The Apprentice' brought on board to help.</p>

<p>Burnett had an idea to send the Trumps off to the White House in style: a ticker-tape parade in New York City and then the Trumps would travel to the top of Trump Tower and helicopter off to Washington.</p>

<p>That, of course, did not happen. </p>

<p>Nor did Ivanka Trump's wish to hold an  Environmental Ball with Leonardo DiCaprio at the National Portrait Gallery. Or Don Jr.'s and Eric's desire to hold a 'Camouflage and Cufflinks' ball. </p>

<p>'In 2005, Donald seemed like a harmless ego maniac.'</p>

<p>'Donald, who has been called 'the King of Bling,' taught Melania how to master the perception of prestige and influence.'</p>

<p>'She wanted to appear assured, mysterious and strong to the outside world.'</p>

<p>'Melania takes extremely good care of herself, inside and out. Especially out. She rarely left her Trump Tower penthouse without an immaculate outfit. She has a glam squad at her beck and call, although she does just fine without them. She's mastered the art of Melania, always seeming perfect, model-like. She would rarely let someone see her without a full face of makeup and perfect do. Don't bother asking her for tips though. She won't share which cosmetic brands she uses.'</p>

<p>'Melania told me the secret of her long marriage to him is that she is completely different from his other wives. Unlike Marla Maples, Melania didn't pressure him emotionally. Unlike Ivana, Donald's first wife, who ran one of his Atlantic City casinos and sold jewelry and clothes on QVC for a decade, Melania didn't pressure Donald for things to do.'</p>

<p>'Melania had had enough of the West Wing's expectation that she drop everything to be available at a moment's notice for her husband. Part of her resentment about it had to do with the West Wing's glacial pace whenever she asked for anything from them.'</p>

<p>'The only way Melania could exert any power was by saying no.'</p>

<p>'A Trump is a Trump is a Trump. All along, I thought she was one of us. Bat at her core, she's one of them.' </p>

<p>Melania's advice on marriage: 'Just let him do what he's going to do. Why get in a fight about something that won't change?' </p>

<p>And Burnett also wanted to light up Washington D.C's sky with drones but that was shot down for security reasons.</p>

<p>Wolkoff also reveals Melania Trump originally did not want Ralph Lauren - an iconic American designer - to produce her outfit for the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol building.</p>

<p>She originally wanted to wear a white suit designed by Karl Lagerfield for the event but was talked into the Ralph Lauren outfit. She eventually wore the white suit when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to the White House in February 2017 in her debut event as first lady.</p>

<p>The inauguration takes up several chapters in Wolkoff's 339-page book, given the controversy around her role in it. The New York Times, in February 2018, published an article revealing the inauguration cost $107 million - twice what Barack Obama's first inauguration cost - and that Wolkoff's firm received $26 million of that money.</p>

<p>Most of that money went to vendors Wolkoff's firm hired to produce the events. </p>

<p>Wolkoff argues the story was planted by her enemies in the White House and by those who didn't want to answer to the where much of the inaugural money went.</p>

<p>'That's the question that everyone should be asking,' she told ABC News of the $107 million raised. </p>

<p>She said she received $480,000 for her three months of work on the inauguration - 'a fee of less than one half of one-percent.' </p>

<p>Her memoir details her 15-year friendship with Melania, who she first met while she was working at Vogue magazine.</p>

<p>It's the first book about Melania Trump to emerge from her inner circle and Wolkoff charts a disillusionment with the first lady, writing that she thought Melania was different but realized 'A Trump is a Trump is a Trump. All along, I thought she was one of us. Bat at her core, she's one of them.'</p>

<p>The book also paints an unflattering portrait of Ivanka Trump, showing her as eager to run the show and claiming she was trying take over many of Melania's first lady duties.</p>

<p>'Ivanka was very focused on Ivanka,' she writes. </p>

<p>In addition to her work on the inauguration, Wolkoff served as an unpaid adviser in the East Wing, helping Melania set up that office and set up her Be Best initiative.</p>

<p>Even after she left the East Wing in February 2018, she and Melania spoke often. She details those conversations in the book and, at times, quotes the first lady extensively. </p>

<p>But Wolkoff refused to confirm or deny to ABC News recent reports that she secretly recorded conversations with Melania Trump.</p>

<p>'I'm not going to comment on whether there's audio or not,' Wolkoff said. 'I can back up everything that's in the book 100% ... and Donald and Melania know that.'</p>

<p>But New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi confirms in her piece last week that Wolkoff has tapes of conversations she had with the first lady. Nuzzi described what she heard: 'Melania's voice was familiar, but she sounded softer, not quite as guarded and steely as she does in public. She was reassuring Wolkoff that things would be okay, that she didn't do anything. It was a bit hard to follow, but it sounded like she cared. Like she was trying to be there for a friend.' </p>

<p>Wolkoff claims in her book that Melania Trump originally wanted to wear the above  white suit designed by Karl Lagerfield for the swearing-in ceremony but was talked into the blue Ralph Lauren outfit she wore. She eventually wore the white suit when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to the White House in February 2017 in her debut event as first lady</p>

<p>She also reveals why Melania wore the white pith helmet on safari in Africa in October 2018; 'I googled 'what to wear on safari,' saw the outfit and liked it,' she quotes Melania as telling her</p>

<p>Melania sparked a firestorm when she wore an infamous green jacket that said 'I really don't care, do u?' on its back when she toured a detention center holding children who had been separated from their parents at the border. She is said to have brushed off the backlash saying, 'I'm driving liberals crazy. You know what? They deserve it'</p>

<p>Wolkoff writes that Melania scoffed at Michelle Obama's time as First Lady and slammed Michelle for not visiting the border, according to the book</p>

<p>Stephanie Winston Wolkoff came under fire after details were revealed about the money she was paid for her role in planning Donald Trump's 2016 presidential inauguration - above she's seen with Melania Trump at a January 2017 dinner ahead of the inaugural</p>

<p>Wolkoff also reveals what the first lady said to her about some of her most infamous moments in her new position, such as when she sparked a firestorm in June of 2018 when she wore a jacket that said 'I really don't care, do u?' on its back when she toured a detention center holding children who had been separated from their parents at the border.</p>

<p>She quotes Melania as telling her: 'I'm driving liberals crazy. You know what? They deserve it.' </p>

<p>But she also reveals the first lady's belief the kids in the detention centers were better off in them than out of them.</p>

<p>Stephanie Winston Wolkoff's book 'Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady' will be released on September 1</p>

<p>'They all went crazy about the zero-tolerance policy at the border. But they don't know what's going on. The kids I met were brought in by coyotes, the bad people who are trafficking, and that's why the kids were put in shelters. They're not with their parents, and it's sad,' she said of the children detained after crossing the US-Mexico border, at times with their families.</p>

<p>'But the patrols told me the kids say, 'Wow, I get a bed? I will have a cabinet for my clothes?' It's more than they have in their own country where they sleep on the floor. They are taking care nicely there,' Melania added. 'Did Michelle Obama go to the border? She never did. Show me the pictures!'</p>

<p>She also reveals Melania Trump simply liked the white pith helmet she wore on safari in African in October 2018 and never made any connection between it and colonization of the continent by European powers.</p>

<p>'I googled 'what to wear on safari,' saw the outfit and liked it,' she quotes Melania as telling her. 'So I bought it. I wasn't making a comment on colonialism.'</p>

<p>And she said the first lady had told her: 'Pleasing anyone else is not my priority.' </p>

<p>Wolkoff writes that while some joked that Melania was trapped in the White House with the Trump family, she was actually a part of the problem.</p>

<p>'[Melania] told me in her way that she was not part of the solution, she was part of the problem. Not speaking up, and not fighting, against the problem, is being part of the problem, and I learned that the hard way.</p>

<p>She also revealed said she and the first lady laughed during the 2016 campaign after the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape came out and revealed Donald Trump saying he liked to grab women 'by the p****.' </p>

<p>'The day that the 'Access Hollywood' tape came out she reached out to have lunch. Now, if any other human being or any other one of my friends I would have expected to see them in tears, right? She was smiling. It was as if nothing happened,'  Wolkoff told ABC's 'Good Morning America' on Monday.</p>

<p>'I said to her, how many times have you heard the word P**** and president in the same sentence and we burst out laughing. Then I said are you upset and doesn't it get you angry and Melania is a pragmatist. Melania, if you can't control people's emotions, then why even worry about it. And that's how she lived her life and that is what she stood by every day,' she added.</p>

<p>In October 2016, The Washington Post revealed the existence of Trump's comments to 'Access Hollywood,' made during a 2005 interview when he and host Billy Bush were preparing to meet actress Arianne Zucker.</p>

<p>Trump said of being famous that it let's you do what you want with women, including 'grab 'em by the p****.' The comments shocked the public and caused many Republicans to withdraw their endorsement of Trump. Pressure was on him to drop out of the race but he stayed in - apologized for the comments - and prevailed in the election.</p>

<p>She also writes in her book Melania told her of Trump: 'I know who I married.' </p>

<p>'Don't feel sorry for me. I'm fine,' the soon-to-be first lady added.  </p>

<p>Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, Melania Trump's former friend, said she and the first lady laughed during the 2016 campaign after the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape came out</p>

<p>Wolkoff told 'GMA' that she can back up all the claims in her book '100 per cent' and that 'and Donald and Melania know that'</p>

<p>Pressure was on Donald Trump to drop out of the 2016 race after comments were revealed in a 2005 'Access Hollywood' interview when he and host Billy Bush were preparing to meet actress Arianne Zucker</p>

<p>Wolkoff's memoir recounts her friendship with Melania Trump and her work with her, including on the presidential inauguration and in the East Wing. </p>

<p>The book also reveals the rivalry and in-fighting between Melania Trump and her step-daughter Ivanka Trump and that Melania said Ivanka Trump and family members working in the White House were a bunch of 'snakes.'</p>

<p>'Ivanka turned into the princess who wanted to be queen,' Wolkoff told ABC News.    </p>

<p>The book claims Melania Trump plotted to keep Ivanka Trump out of the photos of President Trump taking the oath of office on Inauguration Day with her 'Operation Block Ivanka.'</p>

<p>The first lady approved seating arrangements for the inauguration platform that would keep Ivanka Trump out of the camera shot during the moment her father was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. </p>

<p>Wolkoff writes that: 'Ivanka texted me a photo of Barack Obama's swearing-in, his hand on the Bible, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha standing to his left. She wrote, 'FYI regarding the swearing in. It is nice to have family with him for this special moment.''</p>

<p>But, instead, Wolkoff and the incoming first lady launched 'Operation Block Ivanka' to keep the first daughter out of the shot. </p>

<p>The two women went to great lengths to thwart Ivanka.</p>

<p>They took advantage of Wolkoff's position on the inauguration planning committee to gain advance information on how the day would play out in order to make their scheme work. </p>

<p>Melania Trump plotted to block Ivanka Trump from being in photos of President Trump taking the oath of office on Inauguration Day, in what was dubbed 'Operation Block Ivanka'</p>

<p>A forthcoming memoir about first lady Melania Trump - seen above with President Trump on night three of the Republican National Convention - details her tense relationship with Ivanka</p>

<p>Wolkoff, a former Met Gala planner and personal friend of Melania's, was tapped to help produce Inauguration Day and the events surrounding it. </p>

<p>Using her position, she had an executive of her company, WIS Media Partners, take detailed notes on the inauguration platform at the U.S. Capitol building during one of the walk throughs that proceed such events. Walk throughs allow organizers and staff of the attendees to do a practice run of how the day will play out. It allows all the details of the day to be worked out: what time people arrive and in what order, where they will sit, and how the day will play out in precise order.</p>

<p>Using the detailed sketch her employee drew up of the platform on the East Front of the Capitol, where Trump was sworn in with his family and VIP guests behind him, Melania and Wolkoff were able to work out where the cameras would be located on and how the chairs for the family should be positioned to get the images they wanted.</p>

<p>'Using his sketch, we were able to figure out whose face would be visible when Donald and Melania sat in their seats, and then when the family stood with Chief Justice John Roberts for Donald to take the oath of office,' Wolkoff wrote. 'If Ivanka was not on the aisle, her face would be hidden while she was seated. For the standing part, we put Barron between Donald and Melania.'</p>

<p>Melania and Wolkoff then arranged for Donald Trump Jr., the president's oldest son, to be stand next to Melania instead of Ivanka, further keeping her out of the shot.</p>

<p>Wolkoff blames 'exhaustion and stress' for some of the drama but also acknowledges the pettiness of it.</p>

<p>'Yes, Operation Block Ivanka was petty. Melania was in on this mission. But in our minds, Ivanka shouldn't have made herself the center of attention in her father's inauguration,' she wrote.</p>

<p>A wide shot of the swearing-in on Inauguration Day shows Ivanka Trump positioned near the back of her siblings</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump can be seen behind Melania Trump on the inaugural platform at the U.S. Capitol</p>

<p>A rare shot of Ivanka and Melania together on Inauguration Day - this was taken at the viewing stand in front of the White House where the first family watched the inauguration parade go by </p>

<p>She notes their Operation Block Ivanka was a result of the first daughter trying to control the schedule for inauguration day and make sure her family - husband Jared Kushner and their three children - had prominent positions on the big day.</p>

<p>'It was Donald's inauguration, not Ivanka's. But no one was brave enough to tell her that. Melania was not thrilled about Ivanka's steering the schedule and would not allow it. Neither was she happy to hear that Ivanka insisted on walking in the Pennsylvania Avenue parade with her children,' she noted. </p>

<p>Wolkoff's book gives legitimacy to years of talk of a rivalry between Melania and Ivanka that has accumulated in an intense, competitive relationship between the two women.</p>

<p>The two most prominent women in President Trump's life - his 50-year-old wife and his 38-year-old eldest daughter - have little overlap in the White House complex: Ivanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, has an office in the West Wing. Melania Trump works out of the East Wing on the opposite side of the building.</p>

<p>They have never hosted a joint initiative or event. And are rarely seen together at events.</p>

<p>Mary Jordan's book 'The Art of Her Deal' portrayed a tense, at times combative, relationship between the two with Melania calling Ivanka 'Princess' and Ivanka referring to her stepmother as 'portrait.'</p>

<p>Jordan's book also claimed Ivanka tried to have the First Lady's Office be renamed the First Family's Office, which the White House has denied.</p>

<p>An administration official told DailyMail.com that Wolkoff was a 'disaster' in her role in the East Wing and 'took advantage' of the first lady.</p>

<p>'Stephanie was a complete disaster in her temporary role at the White House. She was erratic and dishonest, and was extremely mean to everyone. She threw the First Lady's name around a lot without her knowledge, making people fear Mrs. Trump for no reason,' the administration official said.</p>

<p>'I think the most disturbing aspect was her extreme paranoia. I recall one time she was convinced the wrong shade of paint had been applied to an office on purpose, as a way to show disrespect to the East Wing. The truth is that she only began to claim how close the two were once President Trump took office – she took advantage of Mrs. Trump and was abusive to everyone around her,' the person said. </p>

<p>Wolkoff confirms that Melania refers to her stepdaughter as 'Princess' and paints an unflattering portrait of Ivanka trying to amass power and prestige at her stepmother's expense. </p>

<p>She offers details about Ivanka such as this: 'I received an email from her office. 'I notice that Ivanka's car is not part of the family motorcade. Is there any way to add that?' It. Never. Ended.'</p>

<p>Melania Trump was also reported to be annoyed Ivanka Trump wanted to walk with them in the inauguration parade</p>

<p>Instead, the adult children marched further back: Eric Trump, Lara Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Trump</p>

<p>Wolkoff's memoir traces her friendship with the first lady, going back to their days when Wolkoff worked for Vogue and the then-Melania Knauss was a struggling model dating a New York real estate mogul. </p>

<p>The two women evolved into a friendship that included monthly lunch dates and New York society events.</p>

<p>But that friendship crashed and burned, starting with Trump's election. </p>

<p>Wolkoff also details her side of the story about her dramatic and controversial exit from the East Wing, where she was a contract employee, in February 2018 amid questions about the money her firm had made from its work on President Trump's inauguration celebration.  </p>

<p>Wolkoff, a Manhattan socialite, is a longtime event planner for some of the highest-profile fashion events in New York City. In addition to her work on the Met Gala - know as fashion's biggest night - she also orchestrated Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week's Lincoln Center expansion and has worked closely with legendary Vogue editor Anna Wintour.</p>

<p>It was during her work at Vogue that she met Melania. The then-Melania Knauss was a model dating Trump and about to be launched into society at the Met Gala. Trump proposed to Melania at the 2004 event. Then-Vogue fashion director André Leon Talle traveled to Paris with her to help her pick out her wedding dress.</p>

<p>'Before her Vogue makeover, Melania was a very pretty young woman who seemed like she was playing fancy dress-up - more a brunette Marilyn Monroe than a Jackie O. After Melania's makeover, André Leon Talley's achievement, she was transcendent, high fashion, editorial worthy,' Wolkoff writes in her memoir.</p>

<p>'And the more time I spent with Melania, the more I genuinely liked her. Being with her was like having the sister I never had before - but a really confident, perfectly coiffed, ultimate older sister. In her world, nothing was a big deal, and everything was just as it should be. Just being with her made me feel good. She had her s*** together!,' she added.</p>

<p>The two women became friends. In addition to her work on the inauguration, Wolkoff was one of Melania's first hires for her East Wing staff, where she had a contract position instead of being a fulltime government employee.</p>

<p>Wolkoff recounts how, in January 2017, it was just her and Melania's then-chief of staff Lindsay Reynolds working in the vast suite of East Wing offices when Reynolds got notice that some of Kushner's staff were coming to look at office space on their turf.  </p>

<p>At the time of the incident, Melania Trump was still living in New York, where she was spending the first part of 2017 so Barron could finish out the school year. </p>

<p>Turf wars are common in the White House under every administration where the cramped, crowded office space is at a premium.  The East Wing, however, is usually the purview of the first lady's office and areas under her control, such as the office that coordinates White House tours. There are other auxiliary offices there, such as the military liaison office.</p>

<p>But Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were looking to move their people in. </p>

<p>'The West Wing wasn't big enough for the Kushners. They wanted the East Wing as well,' Wolkoff writes.</p>

<p>'I called Melania to tell her what was going on, and she said, 'This is ridiculous! You have to do something!',' she recounted. </p>

<p>'I dug into my bag; pulled out my red Sharpie and yellow Post-it notes; scribbled 'conference room,' 'chief of staff,' 'deputy of advance,' etc., on them; and slapped them on the office doors. By putting our mark on each office, Jared's people couldn't very well say, 'Well, if no one's using it … we'll take it,'' Wolkoff wrote.</p>

<p>A person who worked on the transition team denied that Ivanka and Kushner tried to take East Wing office space, telling DailyMail.com it didn't happen.</p>

<p>She also describes a conspiracy to keep Melania Trump from hiring the full amount of staff a first lady needed, using the budget and staff vetting process 'like a weapon to prevent Melania from filling them.'</p>

<p>She argues Ivanka enlisted then-chief of staff Reince Priebus, his deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh and influential staffer Hope Hicks to help her efforts.</p>

<p>'Ivanka was relentless and was determined to be the First Daughter Lady and to usurp office space out from under Melania; she wanted to be the only visible female Trump on the premises, and she was actively using her influence with Katie Walsh, Reince Priebus, and Hope Hicks to thwart our efforts,' Wolkoff says.</p>

<p>'Ivanka wasn't playing by the rules, but she never, ever, got in trouble,' she added. </p>

<p> Stephanie Winston Wolkoff's memoir has tapes of Melania Trump speaking ill of Trumps; above Pamela Gross Finkelstein, Judith Giuliani, Melania Knauss Trump and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff attend a luncheon in New York together in 2006</p>

<p>David Wolkoff, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, Melania Trump and Donald Trump at an event in New  York in February 2008 - Wolkoff served as an informal, unpaid adviser to Melania in the East Wing until she left amid the controversy surrounding the inauguration</p>

<p>Wolkoff's memoir, 'Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady,' is the first book to come from a former member of the first lady's inner circle.</p>

<p>Melania Trump has been the subject of two biographies by journalist - CNN's Kate Bennett's 'Free Melania' and The Washington Post's Mary Jordan's 'The Art of Her Deal' - but Wolkoff was a longtime personal friend to the first lady. </p>

<p>Melania Trump dismissed Wolkoff from the East Wing with an email. </p>

<p>'I am sorry that the professional part of our relationship has come to an end, but I am comforted in the fact that our [friendship] far outweigh[s] politics,' the first lady wrote. 'Thank you Again! Much love.' </p>
