        <p>Notorious germaphobe Howie Mandel gagged when watching a contestant spit up a toy duck on Tuesday's semifinals episode of America's Got Talent.</p>

<p>Brett Loudermilk, a 31-year-old street performer from North Carolina, swore that he had swallowed the item in childhood, and brought along an endoscopic camera to prove it.</p>

<p>Howie, 64, stood above him wearing black gloves and a black mask with a face shield, and slowly lowered the camera down into Brett's throat.</p>

<p>Semifinals episode: Notorious germaphobe Howie Mandel gagged when watching a contestant spit up a toy duck on Tuesday's semifinals episode of America's Got Talent</p>

<p>After everyone got a good look at the toy on camera, Brett regurgitated it, saying, 'My child!'</p>

<p>He tried to offer it to Howie, saying, 'That's been in me for 20 years, Howie, keep this!'</p>

<p>Howie pulled away, yelping, 'I don't want it!' as Brett pointed out, 'You're wearing gloves!'</p>

<p>After Howie gestured to Brett to set the duck down, the comedian strode quickly offstage.</p>

<p>Toy duck: Brett Loudermilk, a 31-year-old street performer from North Carolina, swore that he had swallowed the toy duck in childhood, and brought along an endoscopic camera to prove it</p>

<p>Helping hand: Howie, 64, stood above him wearing black gloves and a black mask with a face shield, and slowly lowered the camera down into Brett's throat</p>

<p>Camera view: After everyone got a good look at the toy on camera, Brett regurgitated it, saying, 'My child!'</p>

<p>Back out: The toy duck was spit out as Howie gagged</p>

<p>New judge Sofia Vergara, 48, gave Brett the side-eye, telling him, 'That was the most unnecessary thing. It's like, ''What just happened in front of us?''</p>

<p>'You got a glimpse no one's ever seen before,' Brett cheerily replied.</p>

<p>'But we didn't want to see that,' Sofia said. 'You've gone crazier and crazier with this act, but this one, I don't even know what to say. Ask Howie, he talks a lot. Because I can't say anything.'</p>

<p>Not necessary: New judge Sofia Vergara, 48, gave Brett the side-eye, telling him, 'That was the most unnecessary thing. It's like, ''What just happened in front of us?''</p>

<p>Asked what he thought, Howie said, 'I'm gonna be totally honest. I don't know if I loved it.'</p>

<p>He then corrected himself, saying, 'I didn't love it,' as AGT viewers on a giant TV screen booed him.</p>

<p>'I get it,' Brett said. 'You're a germaphobe, there's a pandemic, I understand.'</p>

<p>Generous offer: Brett tried to offer the toy duck to Howie, saying, 'That's been in me for 20 years, Howie, keep this!'</p>

<p>Howie acknowledged he was right, but wondered, 'If you go through, what's next? How do you top that? With your bottom?'</p>

<p>Heidi Klum, 47, could only add: 'You got to be ducking kidding me with that one!'</p>

<p>Just five acts of the 11 appearing on Tuesday's show will go through to AGT's finals next week, which would give them a shot at a $1 million prize.</p>

<p>Good one: Heidi Klum, 47, could only add: 'You got to be ducking kidding me with that one!'</p>

<p>New judge: Sofia is a new judge for season 15 of the talent competition show being held amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>The W.A.F.F.L.E. Crew from New York City kicked the show off in spectacular fashion, dancing to Joe Budden's Pump It Up in a warehouse on the Universal Studios lot.</p>

<p>'We can always count on you guys to lift our spirit and lift our energy,' said Heidi, as the other judges agreed that Simon Cowell's Golden Buzzer act had been fantastic. </p>

<p>Kenadi Dodds, a 15-year-old singer from North Logan, Utah, next covered Thomas Rhett's Be A Light, and made a fan of Howie, who'd been unimpressed during the quarterfinals.</p>

<p>First up: The W.A.F.F.L.E. Crew from New York City kicked the show off in spectacular fashion, dancing to Joe Budden's Pump It Up in a warehouse on the Universal Studios lot</p>

<p>High energy: 'We can always count on you guys to lift our spirit and lift our energy,' said Heidi, as the other judges agreed that Simon Cowell's Golden Buzzer act had been fantastic</p>

<p>The host: Terry Crews hosted the two-hour semifinals episode on NBC</p>

<p>'Unlike what I said the last time you were on, for me, this performance was a huge step up,' he told her. 'You just made America's job a little tougher.'</p>

<p>Mentalist Max Major, from Las Vegas, wowed the crowd by having the judges name numbers on a roulette wheel, then revealed a lottery ticket with those very numbers.</p>

<p>In a moment that went unnoticed, Max said an audience member gave him the number '14,' though it sounded exactly like '13,' and his act carried on, unaffected.</p>

<p>Teen talent: Kenadi Dodds, a 15-year-old singer from North Logan, Utah, next covered Thomas Rhett's Be A Light, and made a fan of Howie, who'd been unimpressed during the quarterfinals</p>

<p>Mentalist routine: Mentalist Max Major, from Las Vegas, wowed the crowd by having the judges name numbers on a roulette wheel, then revealed a lottery ticket with those very numbers</p>

<p>Oddly, when Max had Heidi toss a ball into a roulette wheel, it landed on 13, which was the same number Max had printed on a billboard at Universal CityWalk Hollywood.</p>

<p>Howie and Sofia proclaimed themselves confused by Max's act, but Heidi asked them, 'What are you not getting?' and reflected that as Max's assistant, she was 'terrific!'</p>

<p>The Bello Sisters, a trio of Italian acrobats aged 13, 19, and 22, then earned a standing ovation from the judges for the way they supported each other while doing contortions.</p>

<p>'Three delicate flowers like you look, and then so strong, so perfect,' Sofia marveled.</p>

<p>Celina Graves, a 30-year-old singer from San Diego, gave the audience chills with her cover of Labrinth's Jealous, which Sofia said was so good, it was like watching an awards show.</p>

<p>Jonathan Goodwin, a 40-year-old Welsh daredevil, scared the judges with a stunt that he said had never been performed before, and which challenged his fear of heights.</p>

<p>Welsh daredevil: Jonathan Goodwin, a 40-year-old Welsh daredevil, scared the judges with a stunt that he said had never been performed before, and which challenged his fear of heights</p>

<p>He rode a zipline by clenching his teeth around a pulley that was lit on fire. Midway, he had to free his bound hands and undo a combination lock to keep going safely.</p>

<p>The ropes above Jonathan's head fell into flames around him, and he barely made it through and across before collapsing onto a platform, his nose smudged with ash.</p>

<p>'You have to be a little cuckoo in the head to do this thing,' a shaken Sofia said. 'This is not like a trick or an illusion; he's actually doing these insane things to himself.'</p>

<p>Little cuckoo: 'You have to be a little cuckoo in the head to do this thing,' a shaken Sofia said. 'This is not like a trick or an illusion; he's actually doing these insane things to himself'</p>

<p>Cristina Rae, a singer from Nashville, Tennessee, hit all the right notes with her rendition of Cynthia Erivo's Jump, which had Howie calling her the vocalist to beat.</p>

<p>Cristina's toddler Jeremiah watched her perform, his face lit up on a TV screen.</p>

<p>'I love you so much,' she told him. 'I want you to always do the impossible.'</p>

<p>Bad Salsa, the Kolkata, India-based dance duo, was another standout for their rapid-fire moves, which often saw dancer Sonali Majumder, 15, flung around by her legs.</p>

<p>'Every time you guys show up, even when I'm watching with my family, everybody wants to dance,' Sofia said. 'I really wish that you guys go to the finals because I love you.'</p>

<p>The Voices Of Our City Choir, from San Diego, turned in a stellar performance of David Bowie's Heroes, earning loud cheers and a standing ovation.</p>

<p>Dynamic duo: Bad Salsa, the Kolkata, India-based dance duo, was another standout for their rapid-fire moves, which often saw dancer Sonali Majumder, 15, flung around by her legs</p>

<p>High praise: 'Every time you guys show up, even when I'm watching with my family, everybody wants to dance,' Sofia said. 'I really wish that you guys go to the finals because I love you'</p>

<p>Bowie song: The Voices Of Our City Choir, from San Diego, turned in a stellar performance of David Bowie's Heroes, earning loud cheers and a standing ovation</p>

<p>Many choir members had been homeless, and in a pre-taped video they thanked founder Stephanie Johnson, who cried when her mom said how proud she was.</p>
