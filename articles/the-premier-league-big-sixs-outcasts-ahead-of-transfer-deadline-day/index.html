    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Autumn may be officially upon us, but unlike the weather the delayed summer transfer window is set to heat up this week as clubs up and down the country rush to complete their business.</p>

<p>It looks set to be a particularly busy time among the Premier League's Big Six, who are desperate to offload unwanted players to lighten the load on their wage bill.</p>

<p>Arsenal could well be the busiest club as Mikel Arteta looks to raise funds to land at least one new midfielder, while Chelsea have a number of stars up for grabs after Frank Lampard's huge summer spending spree.</p>

<p>Chris Smalling looked set to join Roma permanently but is still stuck at Manchester United</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Liverpool have youngsters to move on, Jose Mourinho must decide what to do with Dele Alli and Manchester United are yet to begin clearing their deadwood.</p>

<p>It's a different story at free-spending Manchester City, although one defender has a big decision to make on his future following the arrivals of Ruben Dias and Nathan Ake for over £100million.</p>

<p>Here, Sportsmail runs down the outcasts at the Big Six and looks at where they could end up before the transfer window slams shut on October 5. </p>

<p>ARSENAL </p>

<p>Lucas Torreira (Interested clubs: Atletico Madrid, Torino)</p>

<p>With Arteta eyeing Lyon's Houssem Aouar and Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey, it's no surprise that Torreira has become expendable this summer.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan isn't in the manager's plans and is open to a move elsewhere in order to get his career back on track. The Gunners would prefer a sale, but Atletico hope to take him on loan amid interest from Serie A side Torino.</p>

<p>Lucas Torreira is one of a number of players who could leave Arsenal before the window shuts</p>

<p>Sead Kolasinac (Interested clubs: Bayer Leverkusen)</p>

<p>Another unwanted Arsenal star on the brink of a move is Kolasinac, who has seen his opportunities limited since the arrival of Kieran Tierney last summer.</p>

<p>The left back has been the subject of a £9m bid from Bayer Leverkusen and is likely to depart in order to boost Arteta's transfer kitty. </p>

<p>Mesut Ozil (Interested clubs: Fenerbahce)</p>

<p>Still out of favour and still picking up £350,000 a week. There's been no sign of Ozil on the pitch so far this season and that looks unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>

<p>Arsenal would love to get his wages off the books, but there are no teams willing to match his mega salary. Turkish giants Fenerbahce were interested in him earlier this year but a deal isn't financially viable. </p>

<p>Matteo Guendouzi (Interested clubs: PSG)</p>

<p>Arsenal have actively been trying to sell Guendouzi this summer after he fell out with Arteta during a winter training camp and then bragged about his wages during a brawl at Brighton in June.</p>

<p>The midfielder had looked set for a bright future at the Emirates but concerns over his attitude mean he would be better off moving on. Swap deals to Atletico and Lyon have not got off the ground, although PSG are said to retain an interest in him. </p>

<p>Matteo Guendouzi's time in Arsenal's first team appears to have come to a premature end</p>

<p>Shkodran Mustafi (Interested clubs: Lazio)</p>

<p>With eight central defenders on their books, Arsenal are willing to let Mustafi move on after an up-and-down spell in north London.</p>

<p>The Germany defender has not been involved so far this term and could make a move to Italy, with Lazio reportedly in talks to sign him. </p>

<p>Sokratis Papastathopoulos (Interested clubs: Napoli)</p>

<p>Veteran centre half Sokratis is also on the Gunners' for sale list, with the 32-year-old no longer the right fit for the type of football Arteta wants his side to play.</p>

<p>Napoli have explored a deal for the former Borussia Dortmund man, although a move to Serie A is not a foregone conclusion.  </p>

<p>CHELSEA</p>

<p>Marcos Alonso (Interested clubs: Inter Milan)</p>

<p>Alonso is back in Lampard's bad books after returning to Chelsea's team coach after being substituted during half-time of their 3-3 draw at West Brom on Saturday following two mistakes that led directly to goals conceded.</p>

<p>He was not involved in the Carabao Cup defeat by Tottenham on Tuesday and is reportedly interested in a reunion with former Blues boss Antonio Conte at Inter Milan following the arrival of £50m Ben Chilwell. </p>

<p>Antonio Rudiger (Interested clubs: Tottenham, PSG)</p>

<p>Chelsea have at least one central defender too many after the free signing of veteran Thiago Silva, and it appears Rudiger is the odd man out for Lampard.</p>

<p>The Germany international has been frozen out this season and will be allowed to leave if the right offer comes in. PSG and Spurs have both expressed an interest. </p>

<p>Antonio Rudiger looks to be on his way out of Chelsea after being exiled by Frank Lampard</p>

<p>Kurt Zouma (Interested clubs: Everton, Leicester)</p>

<p>Zouma started the first two games of the season but Thiago's arrival has also seen him falling down the pecking order.</p>

<p>Chelsea are ready to let the 25-year-old Frenchman go too and would hope to bring in around £36m. Everton, with whom he enjoyed a successful loan spell in the 2018-19 season, and Leicester are at the top of the queue.</p>

<p>Emerson Palmieri (Interested clubs: Inter Milan)</p>

<p>Chelsea are keen to cash in on one of their left backs after spending £50m on Chilwell and will let Palmieri go if Alonso doesn't make a move to Inter.</p>

<p>The Serie A giants have also expressed an interest in the former Roma man, who has always been a bit-part player since arriving at Stamford Bridge in 2018. </p>

<p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Interested clubs: Southampton, West Ham)</p>

<p>After being handed a surprise start at Brighton in Chelsea's season opener, Loftus-Cheek has rapidly fallen down in Lampard's estimations.</p>

<p>Chelsea still see him as an important, homegrown player for the future but will allow him to head out on loan in a bid to find form again. Southampton and West Ham are the favourites after Aston Villa brought in another Chelsea outcast, Ross Barkley.</p>

<p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek is set to leave Chelsea on loan, with Southampton and West Ham keen</p>

<p>LIVERPOOL</p>

<p>Rhian Brewster (Interested clubs: Sheffield United, Crystal Palace)</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp is a big admirer of Brewster, the Golden Boot winner in England Under-17s World Cup win, but there just isn't room for him in a Liverpool squad jam-packed with attacking talent, particularly after the arrival of Diogo Jota from Wolves.</p>

<p>Sheffield United are closing in on a deal for the youngster after making a £17m offer, although they will include a buy-back option as Reds chiefs protect themselves should Brewster go on to reach his huge potential. </p>

<p>Sheffield United are closing in on a deal for Liverpool's Rhian Brewster with a buy-back clause</p>

<p>Harry Wilson (Interested clubs: Burnley)</p>

<p>Another youngster Liverpool are willing to cash in on is Wilson, who stands little chance of breaking into Klopp's title-winning midfield this term.</p>

<p>The Wales international spent a loan spell at Bournemouth last season and is now the subject of a £16m bid from Burnley, according to recent reports. </p>

<p>Marko Grujic (Interested clubs: Hertha Berlin)</p>

<p>Grujic is another saleable asset for the Premier League champions, who are looking to recoup some of the £65m they spent on Jota and Thiago Alcantara this month.</p>

<p>The midfielder impressed on loan at Hertha Berlin over the last two seasons and the Bundesliga club are interested in taking him on a permanent deal.   </p>

<p>MANCHESTER CITY</p>

<p>John Stones (Interested clubs: Everton, West Ham)</p>

<p>Stones appeared to have lost the faith of Pep Guardiola last season and found his playing time limited, making just 25 appearances in all competitions.</p>

<p>But after starting City's season opener against Wolves, the former Everton man wants to stay and fight for his place despite the arrivals of Ake and Dias. Chelsea and Arsenal both expressed an interest in him earlier in the window but former club Everton and West Ham now appear more likely options. </p>

<p>John Stones (left) looks set to stay at Manchester City despite struggling for playing time</p>

<p>MANCHESTER UNITED</p>

<p>Sergio Romero (Interested clubs: Everton)</p>

<p>After the return of Dean Henderson from his loan spell at Sheffield United, Sergio Romero, a goalkeeper with 90 caps for Argentina, somehow finds himself as Manchester United's third-choice goalkeeper.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old is unlikely to get any minutes unless Henderson or David de Gea are struck down by injury and could look for a fresh start elsewhere. Everton are said to be interested as they eye competition for the error-prone Jordan Pickford.</p>

<p>Sergio Romero is now Manchester United's third-choice keeper after Dean Henderson's return</p>

<p>Chris Smalling (Interested clubs: Roma, Inter Milan)</p>

<p>Smalling's permanent move to Roma looked a formality following an impressive loan spell last season, but he now finds himself back at United and behind Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly in the ranks after difficulties in agreeing a fee.</p>

<p>Roma have not given up hope of bringing the former England defender back to the Stadio Olimpico, while Inter Milan have also considered making a bid.</p>

<p>Diogo Dalot (Interested clubs: AC Milan)</p>

<p>Dalot has only made one appearance since March and his time at United appears to be coming to an end, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer preferring Timothy Fosu-Mensah as back-up to Aaron Wan-Bissaka.</p>

<p>AC Milan have emerged as the favourites to sign him as they search for a new right back before the window closes, although they are unlikely to match the £19m United paid Porto two years ago. </p>

<p>Jesse Lingard (Interested clubs: Tottenham)</p>

<p>Academy product Lingard has made just two substitute appearances in the Premier League since February and is clearly out of Solskjaer's plans. </p>

<p>He scored 13 goals in 48 matches under Mourinho during his best campaign for United in the 2017/18 season, and the Spurs boss is reportedly keen on linking up again with the hard-working midfielder.</p>

<p>Andreas Pereira (Interested clubs: Lazio)</p>

<p>With the arrivals of Donny van de Beek and Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford this year, there isn't room for another attack-minded midfielder in Solskjaer's squad, let alone his starting XI.</p>

<p>Pereira is well aware of that and has taken the decision to move in order to kick-start his career elsewhere. A loan switch to Lazio is all set to be completed after he flew into Rome on Wednesday, and there is a view to a £24.5m permanent move. </p>

<p>Midfielder Andreas Pereira is close to completing a permanent move to Serie A side Lazio </p>

<p>TOTTENHAM</p>

<p>Dele Alli (Interested clubs: PSG)</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest star facing an uncertain future after being frozen out is Alli, who was nowhere to be seen as Tottenham dumped Chelsea out of the Carabao Cup on penalties on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Mourinho claims he has too many players, but it is clear he has doubts over Alli's attitude and has not included the midfielder in either of his last two Premier League squads - although he might make a rare appearance in the Europa League on Thursday night -  with PSG among the clubs keeping an eye on the situation. </p>

<p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy wants to keep the former MK Dons starlet, but Alli is said to be considering his future with time running out to secure a move.</p>

<p>Dele Alli is out of favour under Jose Mourinho and is considering his future with Tottenham</p>

<p>Danny Rose (Interested clubs: Genoa)</p>

<p>One player who looks certain to leave before the deadline is Rose, who has not even been given a squad number after falling out with Mourinho last season.</p>

<p>The defender spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Newcastle but is keen on a move to Italy, with Genoa interested in bringing him to Serie A. </p>

<p>Ryan Sessegnon (Interested clubs: Celtic, Southampton)</p>

<p>Yet to make an appearance this season after just 12 in his first season at the club, Sessegnon appears surplus to requirements after the arrival of Sergio Reguilon.</p>

<p>The former Fulham left back, still just 20, is unlikely to be sold, although a season-long loan move to Celtic or Southampton could be on the cards. </p>
