        <p>Zara McDermott sent temperatures soaring once again as she uploaded a series of sizzling lingerie snaps to Instagram on Monday.</p>

<p>The former Love Island star, 23, who is said to be having 'crisis talks' to repair her relationship with ex Sam Thompson, looked incredible in the red lace set.</p>

<p>The beauty displayed her eye-popping physique as she posed seductively next to a window with the curtains drawn.</p>

<p>Photoshoot: Zara McDermott, 23, sent temperatures soaring once again as she uploaded a series of sizzling lingerie snaps to Instagram on Monday</p>

<p>The reality star also wore a white shirt in the shots as she showcased her gym-honed figure.</p>

<p>Adding a touch of glamour with a smokey eye, Zara fixed the camera with a sultry stare. </p>

<p>The social media sensation completed her look for the shoot by styling her dark blonde locks into a ponytail. </p>

<p>Zara and Sam parted ways amid claims she cheated on him while taking part in The X Factor: Celebrity last year. </p>

<p>Radiant: The beauty displayed her eye-popping physique as she posed seductively next to a window with the curtains drawn </p>

<p>The fallout from the breakup will reportedly play out before the cameras in explosive scenes on Made In Chelsea.   </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'The cameras have captured the whole fallout of Zara and Sam's dramatic split.</p>

<p>'It means viewers will get to see the raw emotion caused by Zara's infidelity last year, as Sam tries to come to terms with what has happened.</p>

<p>'There's going to be a lot of tears and rows as Zara fights for her relationship.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Zara and Sam for comment.   </p>

<p>All over: It was recently reported the couple had split and claims later emerged the break-up came after Sam, 28, discovered Zara had cheated on him a year ago</p>

<p>Zara continued to put on a brave face following her split as she shared a sizzling bikini snap on Sunday.</p>

<p>The star set pulses racing as she showcased her incredible physique in a tiny mauve bikini that highlighted her washboard abs.</p>

<p>Zara was inundated with messages from her followers with many saying 'wow' and one calling her the 'most beautiful girl in the world'. </p>

<p>It comes after the star was reportedly having crisis talks with Sam in a bid to salvage their relationship.  </p>

<p>Beauty: Zara continued to put on a brave face as she shared a sizzling bikini snap on Sunday</p>

<p>Their broken relationship is now reportedly 'hanging in the balance' as the pair have been unable to talk while the Made In Chelsea star films The Circle with pal Pete Wicks, but the Love Island star 'is fighting hard to get him back'.</p>

<p>Sam has taken some time away from Zara to film the Channel 4 program, The Circle, but that reportedly hasn't stopped her attempts to ask for forgiveness. </p>

<p>An insider told The Sun: 'Their relationship is hanging in the balance. Sam left to film The Circle saying he couldn't be with Zara right now.</p>

<p>'She's fighting so hard to get him back. She's going to do everything she can to prove he can trust her again.</p>

<p>'Even though it's split them apart right now, people have got through worse in their relationships and gone on to be stronger, she loves him so much and isn't giving up hope that he'll forgive her. There are plans for them to meet up as soon as Sam is back. It'll be make or break for their relationship.'  </p>

<p>Speaking out: Sam finally broke his silence since his breakup from Zara as he thanked his close friend Pete Wicks for being there for him when he is 'down' on Saturday</p>

<p>Sam wrote: 'I’m incredibly lucky to have people I can lean on when I’m down. I know you’re not the soppy type, but you really are the brother I never had'</p>

<p>It comes after Sam broke his social media silence on Saturday when he thanked his close friend and TOWIE star Pete for being there for him when he is 'down'.</p>

<p>The Made In Chelsea alum shared a snap of himself looking dapper in a black suit as he used an app to make Pete, 31, appear several years older. </p>

<p>Alongside the photo, Sam wrote: 'Thank you so much for putting up with me for the past week @p_wicks01.  </p>

<p>'I’m incredibly lucky to have people I can lean on when I’m down. I know you’re not the soppy type, but you really are the brother I never had. </p>

<p>'I love you mate ❤️ good to see I haven't aged you over the past 6 days.' </p>

<p>While Zara may be worried behind closed doors, she showed no signs of heartache as she uploaded a series of stunning selfies to her Instagram.  </p>

<p>The former Love Island star showcased her striking features as she posed in a white vest top after styling her blonde locks into loose waves. </p>

<p>The reality star looked sensational as she donned an off the shoulder blue and white top with a sheer, ruffled detail.  </p>

<p>Zara also recently posed in a white bustier that she paired with matching underwear for a racy bathroom selfie.</p>

<p>Wow! It comes after Zara sizzled in a white bustier and underwear as she put on a defiant display amid claims she 'cheated on Sam early in their romance'</p>

<p>Ex-Factor! Zara was reportedly having crisis talks with Sam in a bid to salvage their relationship</p>

<p>A source revealed to MailOnline  the tryst took place between Zara and 'someone in the music industry' around the time she took part in X Factor: Celebrity.</p>

<p>The reality star appeared on the series last summer and autumn, as part of the Love Island pop group No Love Lost.</p>

<p>At this point, she had been in a relationship with Sam for several months – but it's said the Made In Chelsea star has only recently found out about the infidelity.</p>

<p>Love lost: A source revealed that the reported tryst took place between Zara and 'someone in the music industry' around the time she took part in X Factor: Celebrity in 2019 [pictured]</p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'Zara cheated on Sam with someone in the music industry. Someone connected to the X Factor.</p>

<p>'Sam is obviously distraught about this. He only found out about it very recently and has escaped for a few days. </p>

<p>'Zara regrets it and feels terrible. She knows it was a huge mistake and is extremely upset.' </p>

<p>Behind the scenes: She appeared on the series last summer, as part of the Love Island pop group No Love Lost [pictured with Wes Nelson, Eyal Booker and Samira Mighty]</p>

<p>The couple were an item for 16 months, with Zara joining Sam on the E4 show as a cast member.</p>

<p>On the show, she was seen declaring that she wants to marry and have children with Sam. She also moved in with him at the start of lockdown.</p>

<p>Zara reacted passionately when Sam's ex Tiffany Watson returned to the series this year, upset at the mere idea that Tiff was back on the scene.</p>

<p>The last episode to air this year – before the series was cut short thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic – saw Zara in floods of tears over Sam's civility towards his former-girlfriend Tiffany.</p>

<p>Drama! The couple were an item for 16 months, with Zara joining Sam on his E4 show Made In Chelsea as a cast member and often seen upset with him</p>

<p>A source told MailOnline on Thursday: 'Zara and Sam split towards the end of last month. They had been arguing a lot since moving in together as a result of lockdown and things just built up between them.</p>

<p>'Zara has moved back to her parents' house in Essex where she's taking some time for herself, she really loved Sam so this hasn't been easy for her.</p>

<p>'Sam has gone away to have a break from it all and clear his head away from Zara and social media.'</p>

<p>Louise tweeted last Wednesday: 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful,' which prompted fans to assume she had trouble in her own relationship with fiancé Ryan Libbey.</p>

<p>Days later she sparked further speculation by posting: 'Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair' followed by 'I'm proud of my heart. It's been played, stabbed, cheated, burned and broken… somehow still works.' </p>

<p>An insider told MailOnline: 'Things between Louise and Ryan are really great. Her tweet last week was actually aimed at a friend.'</p>

<p>Zara and Sam, who regularly post on Instagram and TikTok together, haven't shared any content as a couple since August. </p>

<p>Sisterly love: Louise tweeted, 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful,' which prompted fans to assume she had trouble in her own relationship with Ryan Libbey [pictured]</p>

<p>But an insider told MailOnline: 'Things between Louise and Ryan are really great. Her tweet last week was actually aimed at a friend' </p>
