        <p>Kim Kardashian West announced the end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians after 14 years in a statement to fans on Tuesday, without explaining the reason for its exit.</p>

<p>It has since been suggested the reason behind the show's departure from E! is because the family asked for more money but the network were unwilling to cough up, following reports their previous five season contract was worth $150million.</p>

<p>Page Six have reported that E!'s parent company NBCUniversal have been hit with financial woes amid the coronavirus crisis and were unable offer the cast members any more money to film the hugely-successful show.</p>

<p>It's the end: It has since been suggested the reason behind Keeping Up With The Kardashian's departure from E! is because the family asked for more money but the network were unwilling to cough up</p>

<p>During the fallout the network also lost its flagship E! News programme, which had aired on the channel for 30 years and has now been replaced by Daily Pop and Nightly Pop.</p>

<p>The publication suggested that whenever Kris and her kids have suggested leaving in the past, bosses have always been able to offer more money - but not this time.</p>

<p>Sources have said that the cast wanted to increase their pay cheque for their next contract but the network were unable to come to an agreement.  </p>

<p>It has been well-reported in recent years that TV ratings for the Kardashian's show have dwindled in comparison to the programme's late noughties hey day, when it attracted more than four million live viewers.</p>

<p>Can't be done: Page Six have reported that E!'s parent company NBCUniversal have been hit with financial woes amid the coronavirus crisis and were unable offer the cast members any more money to film the hugely-successful show</p>

<p>Following its premiere in 2007 the attention-grabbing reality show was continually on the rise until it reached its peak three years later during the season four final which pulled in on average 4.8 million viewers.  </p>

<p>The 18th and most recent season of the E! stalwart, which was cut short due to the coronavirus outbreak, enticed just 1 million viewers during it's premiere earlier this year. Falling by 400,000 compared to the previous series.</p>

<p>Other episodes from the series, which featured a physical fight between sisters Kim and Kourtney, fell to between 871,000 and 910,000 viewers.  </p>

<p>Not this time! The publication suggested that whenever Kris and her kids have suggested leaving in the past, bosses have always been able to offer more money - but not this time (pictured Kourtney, Kim and Khloe)</p>

<p>While a money row is one explanation for the show's end, it has also been reported that Kris decided to pull the plug on Keeping Up With The Kardashians after three of her daughters threatened to quit the long-running show.</p>

<p>The mother-of-six, 64, apparently called time on the show after 14 years when Kim, 39, Kourtney Kardashian, 41, and Kylie Jenner, 23, all expressed their desire to end the programme.</p>

<p>However a source told the Sun that Khloe Kardashian, 36, and Scott Disick, 37, are believed to be 'devastated' the reality show is coming off air early next year after 20 seasons.</p>

<p>Time to say goodbye: Kris reportedly decided to pull the plug on Keeping Up With The Kardashians after three of her daughters threatened to quit the long-running show</p>

<p>The family have apparently been 'locked in an ongoing debate' over the future of the show for 'months', before announcing on Tuesday that they would no longer be filming the hit production.</p>

<p>An insider told the publication: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'</p>

<p>Discussing Kylie's departure, they added: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.' </p>

<p>It's the end: The mother-of-six, 64, apparently called time on the show after 14 years when Kim Kourtney, and Kylie all expressed their desire to end the programme</p>

<p>They also noted that she is free to tour with her daughter Stormi's father Travis Scott.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kourtney had already taken a step back from the show and decided to become a secondary character during the most recent season to focus on raising her three children Mason, 10, eight, and Reign, five.</p>

<p>Kourtney previously said she felt the show had become a 'toxic environment' and was consuming to much of her day-to-day life. The insider claimed she is 'glad' the show has finally come to an end.</p>

<p>Discussing Kylie's departure, they added: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight'</p>

<p>A different source told the Sun however that the decision was not made by one person and was decided following a discussion between the whole family. </p>

<p>MailOnline have contacted representatives for comment. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show would be ending after 14 years on the air.</p>

<p>The announcement was an open love letter to the devout fan following they have accumulated over their years on the air, but it did not explicitly state a reason for pulling the plug on the series. </p>

<p>Debate: The family have apparently been 'locked in an ongoing debate' over the future of the show for 'months', before announcing on Tuesday that they would no longer be filming the hit production</p>

<p>While viewership has dwindled and the cast members' pay-cheques have only increased, it has long been questioned when the reality show would air its final season. </p>

<p>Sources close to the situation claimed to TMZ that the Kardashian-Jenner family decided to step away from the show because their 'brand [gets] way more play on social media outlets and through their personal businesses than on TV.'</p>

<p>According to the sources, the Kardashians initially used their television series, which premiered in 2007, as a means of marketing themselves and the plethora of products they have put out over the years.</p>

<p>Together: A different source told the Sun however that the decision was not made by one person and was decided following a discussion between the whole family</p>

<p>But with the growth of social media and streaming platforms threatening the fate of cable, motivation to maintain the series diminished.</p>

<p>A source explained: 'Social media has largely replaced what "Keeping Up" once provided.'</p>

<p>It is no secret that viewership has dropped in recent years and less than 900,000 live viewers on average tuned into the 18th and most recent series of the programme.</p>

<p>With the Kardashian family now arguably bigger than the show, it can also be called into question whether it is justifiable to keep paying them millions of pounds per season to keep the show going.</p>

<p>It was previously reported by TMZ that the family received a $150million pay day in 2017 when they signed on for a five season deal, meaning they are paid $30million per episode.</p>

<p>The family have also been hit by personal struggles as Kim's husband Kanye, 43, suffered a very public breakdown and Kim reportedly refused to reference Kanye's episode on the show.</p>

<p>Not happy: However a source told the Sun that Khloe Kardashian, 36, and Scott Disick, 37, are believed to be 'devastated' the reality show is coming off air early next year after 20 seasons</p>

<p>Kim's concern for her family life may well be behind the decision to call it quits on the show, as the majority of scenes are now based around Kim and her sister Khloe. </p>

<p>Kourtney also featured heavily on the show before she decided to take a step back to focus on motherhood last series, which sparked a physical fight between herself and Kim.</p>

<p>The brawl was widely-panned by fans who said that they were portraying negative behaviour on their programme, which may also have been a consideration when pulling the plug on the show.</p>

<p>Sisters: Kourtney previously said she felt the show had become a 'toxic environment' and was consuming to much of her day-to-day life</p>

<p>Discussing their decision to end the show, Kim wrote in her statement: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  </p>

<p>'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.'</p>

<p>'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she added. </p>

<p>Statement: On Tuesday, Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show would be ending after 14 years on the air</p>

<p>'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.</p>

<p>'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.</p>

<p>'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.' </p>

<p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians was a ratings winner right out of the gate when it premiered in October 2007 on cable network E!.</p>

<p>It had been pitched by mom-of-six Kris Jenner to  TV host and producer Ryan Seacrest who was looking to bring a fly-on-the-wall show to E! following the huge success of MTV's The Osbournes that ran from 2002 to 2005.</p>

<p>Kris persuaded him that she and her children - three daughters and a son with former O.J. Simpson defense attorney Robert Kardashian and two daughters with Olympic decathlete Bruce Jenner - would be a perfect fit. </p>

<p>Fly on the wall: Keeping Up With The Kardashians was a ratings winner right out of the gate when it premiered in October 2007 on cable network E!</p>

<p>A few months before the first episode was set to air, a sex tape featuring Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian was leaked, generating headlines and interest in the 27-year-old.</p>

<p>She had made the tape in 2002 with then boyfriend Ray J but the timing of its release five years later couldn't have been better timed. </p>

<p>The publicity surrounding the sex tape considerably raised Kim's public profile; until then she was best known for being an assistant to Simple Life star and hotel heiress Paris Hilton. </p>

<p>Timing: Kris Jenner masterminded the reality show and a few months before the first episode aired, a sex tape starring her daughter Kim was leaked, generating huge interest in the series</p>

<p>The E! series made global stars of Kim and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian as well as her half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. </p>

<p>In the past 13 years, they have grown up on camera, sharing their life and loves, heartache and happiness, their changing faces and changing bodies, and the births of their own children.</p>

<p>More than that, though, they have taken TV fame and spun it into a huge money-making empire, with a lot of help from social media and some very clever marketing.</p>

<p>They mastered the art of keeping hundreds of millions of Twitter and Instagram users engaged with multiple posts a day and then found ways to make money from it.</p>

<p>They used their platforms to sell everything from makeup and perfume to waist trainers and underwear, while also striking lucrative endorsement deals and signing up for high-paid public appearances.  </p>

<p>Throughout it all, Kris has managed her children's careers, taking 10 percent of their earnings in addition to her own fees from the TV show and its spin-offs.</p>

<p>While KUWTK may be coming to an end after 20 seasons, there's no doubt we haven't heard the last of the momager, her kids and grandkids. </p>

<p>Kylie Jenner - KUWTK made her a billionaire (well, almost) </p>

<p>She is the youngest of Kris Jenner's six children but she's also now the richest.</p>

<p>Kylie Jenner, 23, is the youngest but richest of the KUWTK stars</p>

<p>Kylie, 23, made the cover of Forbes magazine in 2019 as the 'the world's youngest self-made billionaire' after she sold 51 percent of her Kylie Cosmetics company to beauty giant Coty in a deal valued at $1.2 billion.</p>

<p>Forbes subsequently retracted the 'billionaire' title reckoning that, in reality, she was only worth an estimated $900 million.</p>

<p>Kylie's personal wealth came thanks mainly to her decision to start getting lip fillers when she was 18. And while she initially denied getting enhancements, she later acknowledged it and launched a collection of lip kits in 2015.</p>

<p>The following year, due to the tremendous success of her initial products, she launched Kylie Cosmetics. </p>

<p>Kylie has also partnered with sister Kendall in a clothing line, founded her own skincare line, Kylie Skin, and released her own fragrance through half-sister Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty.  </p>

<p>Kim Kardashian - Game app, shapewear and beauty products add up to $900 million</p>

<p>It can certainly be argued that without her sex tape, she and her family might never have achieved unimaginable wealth.</p>

<p>But while Kim Kardashian Superstar raised her profile, Kim, 39, made sure to capitalize on every opportunity that came her way subsequently.</p>

<p>Kim, 29, earns up to  a rumored $1 million for a paid Instagram post</p>

<p>Unquestionably the star of her family's reality show, her televised 2011 wedding to NBA pro Kris Humphries was a ratings blockbuster. Her divorce and subsequent marriage to rapper Kanye West kept fans fascinated by her private life.</p>

<p>Forbes estimates Kim's fortune to be $900 million.</p>

<p>In 2014, she launched mobile game app Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and it made $1.6 million in the first five days after its release. In 2015, she released her own range of Kimojis.</p>

<p>In addition to her TV fees, paid endorsements and appearances, the bulk of Kim's wealth comes thanks to her KKW Beauty company. </p>

<p>In 2019, the Product line raked in $100 million and she gained $200 million by selling a 20 percent stake in the company to Coty, the same company that bought Kylie's brand. </p>

<p>Her SKIMS shapewear launched last year is also a huge revenue generator and she can earn up to $1 million for a paid Instagram post. </p>

<p>Kris Jenner - the momager takes her cut to the tune of $90 million (at the very least) </p>

<p>As her daughters' manager, Kris, 64, get a 10 percent cut of each of their earnings</p>

<p>Kris, 64, is the mastermind behind everything Kardashian, and that's how she makes her fortune.</p>

<p>In 2018, Forbes reckoned her net worth to be $37.5 million but it's certainly grown plenty since then with some placing her true net worth at somewhere between $90 and $140 million.</p>

<p>The bulk of her income comes from her 10 percent fees as the manager of her children's careers.</p>

<p>She also has stakes in some of her kids' companies; for example, when Kylie sold her cosmetics company in 2019, Kris pocketed $60 million from the deal, Forbes reported.</p>

<p>Khloe Kardashian - denim and workouts bring her an estimated $50 million</p>

<p>Khloe Kardashian, 36, has dramatically transformed her look during the series</p>

<p>Khloe, 36, has carved out her own niche in the Kardashian family marketplace.</p>

<p>She is perhaps the sister who has most transformed their look in recent years, almost to the point of being unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Her fitness regimen in the wake of her divorce from Lamar Odom helped land her her own TV show Revenge Body, and she also hosted the TV chat show Kocktails With Khloe.</p>

<p>In 2016, she founded Good American, which began with a line of jeans and has since expanded to include bodysuits, activewear and swimwear. </p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian - lifestyle website helps Poosh her earnings to upwards of $35 million</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian, 41, makes most of her money from the TV show</p>

<p>Kourtney, 41, the eldest of the Kardashian siblings, is most reliant on the TV show for her income.</p>

<p>However, like her sisters, she makes money with paid product endorsements and paid Instagram posts.</p>

<p>In 2017 she partnered with fashion retailer Pretty Little Thing.</p>

<p>Then last year, Kourtney launched her lifestyle website Poosh where companies can sell their products directly to consumers attracted to Kourtney's brand.  </p>

<p>Kendall Jenner - modeling career enhanced TV fame for $30 million net worth</p>

<p>Kendall Jenner, 24, earns millions from her modeling career</p>

<p>Kendall, 24, turned her attention several years ago to trying to fulfill her dream of becoming a fashion model.</p>

<p>Thanks to her TV and social media celebrity, she won contracts with some of the world's top brands making her the highest-paid model of 2018, according to Forbes.</p>

<p>Forbes estimated her net worth at $22.5 million but it's only increased since then.</p>

<p>She has also teamed up with younger sister Kylie for clothing, jewelry and swimwear lines and like the rest of her sisters, she gets plenty of paid endorsement work.</p>

<p>Rob Kardashian - sporadic TV appearances net him $10 million</p>

<p>Rob, 33, is the only boy in the family of girls and has played a much more low-key role in the KUWTK world.</p>

<p>Initially featuring on the reality show, he subsequently retreated from the spotlight as he battled a number of health issues.</p>

<p>He had his won sock company Arthur George and in 2016, he agreed to star in a spin-off Rob &amp; Chyna, that followed his relationship with fiancee Blac Chyna and the birth of their daughter Dream.</p>

<p>His estimated $10 million net worth comes mostly from his TV appearance fees. </p>
