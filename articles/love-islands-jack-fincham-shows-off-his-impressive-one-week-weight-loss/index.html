        <p>Jack Fincham took to Instagram on Monday night to show off his impressive one week weight loss after resuming his gruelling boxing regime.</p>

<p>The Love Island star, 29, who recently boosted his hairline following a hair transplant four months ago, posted two shirtless comparison snaps to his Stories.</p>

<p>In the first picture taken on week one, Jack, who is determined to become a professional boxer, posed in his kitchen wearing a pair of black shorts.</p>

<p>Before and after: Jack Fincham took to Instagram on Monday night to show off his impressive one week weight loss after resuming his gruelling boxing regime (pictured before, left, and after, right) </p>

<p>While in the second snap, taken just seven days later, the reality star flexed his muscles in blue shorts as he beamed to the camera.</p>

<p>Jack also shared a video of himself on a spin bike, filmed by professional boxer Shabaz Maverick Masoud. </p>

<p>The reality star revealed in October that he was training in the hopes of becoming a professional boxer.    </p>

<p>The reality TV star had 26 amateur bouts for Eltham ABC after starting to box at the age of 14, before turning his back on the sport at 18.</p>

<p>Week one: The Love Island star, 29, who recently boosted his hairline following a hair transplant four months ago, posted two shirtless comparison snaps to his Stories </p>

<p>Amazing: In the second snap, taken just seven days later, the reality star flexed his muscles in blue shorts as he beamed to the camera </p>

<p>He told iFL TV: 'I went back to boxing not that long ago and then started filming a TV show, so couldn't commit as much as I wanted to.</p>

<p>'With boxing, you can't play boxing, you can't do it half-heartedly, you've gotta be there every day in that gym working.</p>

<p>'Now I've sort of managed to work my life around the boxing, I've gone back to it properly, and I do want to turn over, I do wanna turn pro.'</p>

<p>Jack has been overhauling his diet and exercise regime after he was warned by doctors in February 2019 that he was in the 'obese' BMI category following his stint on Love Island. </p>

<p>Back to it: Jack also shared a video of himself on a spin bike, filmed by professional boxer Shabaz Maverick Masoud</p>

<p>Dreams: The reality star revealed in October that he was training in the hopes of becoming a professional boxer</p>

<p>The star admitted that he had put weight on since getting together with now ex-girlfriend Dani Dyer as they would eat lots of takeaways.</p>

<p>Speaking in an interview with BBC Sport Get Inspired, Jack said: 'It's strange because when you think of obese you think of someone who can't move. But I can go on a run - I'm fit. </p>

<p>'I put on a bit of weight. I've never been fat, I'm not fat now, but I was just a bit slow.</p>

<p>'There have been times when I should probably get in the gym but if Dani goes, 'Shall we get a curry and stay in and watch a film?' I have to think about what's more interesting.'</p>

<p>Impressive: The reality TV star had 26 amateur bouts for Eltham ABC after starting to box at the age of 14, before turning his back on the sport at 18</p>

<p>Plans: He told iFL TV: 'With boxing, you can't play boxing, you can't do it half-heartedly, you've gotta be there every day in that gym working.' </p>

<p>Elsewhere, earlier this month Jack revealed that he had headed back to KSL Clinic in Maidstone, Kent, to have a treatment on his hairline following a transplant to cover up a scar after developing a bald spot.  </p>

<p>The reality star had a sample of blood taken out of his forearm before hair transplant surgeon Dr Matee made injections along the top of his scalp to boost his hair growth.  </p>

<p>Speaking on the KSL Instagram page, he said: 'I had my hair transplant about four months ago but I come back regular for PRPs to boost the growing.'</p>

<p>Combing his fingers through his brunette locks, Jack appeared overjoyed with his noticeably thicker hairline and even joked he could have hair down to his chest. </p>

<p>He added: 'Now I've sort of managed to work my life around the boxing, I've gone back to it properly, and I do want to turn over, I do wanna turn pro.'  </p>

<p>Turning to Dr Matee, he added: 'Hang on a minute I have an afro. It works - I can't believe it!'</p>

<p>The father-of-one revealed in June that he cut his head open following an accident at home which caused a scar on his scalp and 'made the hair look thin around it'.  </p>

<p>Jack underwent a hair transplant and has had regular PRP treatment, which injects the patient's own platelets into the scalp, to keep his hairline strong and healthy.  </p>

<p>Speaking about his hair journey in June, he said: 'I ended up killing two birds with one stone and getting a hair transplant on the scar and hairline it don't even hurt man! Can't recommend @ksl_clinics enough they're unreal at what they do!'</p>

<p>Image overhaul: Elsewhere, earlier this month Jack revealed that he had headed back to KSL Clinic in Maidstone, Kent, to have a treatment on his hairline following a transplant to cover up a scar after developing a bald spot  </p>

<p>Expanding on the process, he continued: 'I can't believe how straight forward it is, literally they just drill in at the back, take the hair out and put it in a pot! I didn't think it was that simple, but it really is!'</p>

<p>Speaking of how he tackled the process, he admitted: 'I was well nervous before I had it. But once I laid down with Netflix on, a couple of toilet breaks, I was sweet.'</p>

<p>The clinic, which has branches across the country, gave Jack platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment over the past year, before he joined a host of fellow celebrities in boosting his hairline.</p>

<p>He said: 'I've been amazed by the results at KSL Clinic especially Jake Quickenden, Mike Hassini, Kieran Nicholls and my friend Joe Swash.'</p>

<p>Treatment: Speaking on the KSL Instagram page, he said: 'I had my hair transplant about four months ago but I come back regular for PRPs to boost the growing.'</p>

<p>'They all spoke really highly of their experience here at KSL Clinic and with their hair transplant surgeon Dr Matee.'     </p>

<p>Of their initial decision to inform him that he didn't need a hair transplant, Jack noted: 'I appreciate the honesty of KSL Clinic and the advice given to me by their hair surgeon Dr Matee.</p>

<p>'I was informed that I didn't actually need a hair transplant when I first visited the clinic one year ago - not many places would be as truthful.'</p>

<p>His hairline is just one of a few major changes in Jack's life over the past several months, as he welcomed his first child, a daughter called Blossom, into the world back in January.   </p>
