        <p>She said she wanted photographs that captured a 'snapshot of life during lockdown'.</p>

<p>And that's exactly what the Duchess of Cambridge has amassed.</p>

<p>Hold Still, a photography initiative launched by Kate with the National Portrait Gallery, attracted more than 31,000 entries from members of the public in just six weeks.</p>

<p>With the help of a judging panel comprising Nicholas Cullinan, director of the gallery; poet Lemn Sissay; Ruth May, Chief Nursing Officer for England; and photographer Maryam Wahid, the Duchess has whittled these down to 100 'finalists' whose work goes on display in a digital exhibition at www.npg.org/holdstill today.</p>

<p>The Queen has also written a special message of congratulations to all those who submitted an image. She said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge and I were inspired to see how the photographs have captured the resilience of the British people at such a challenging time, whether that is through celebrating frontline workers, recognising community spirit or showing the efforts of individuals supporting those in need.'</p>

<p>The 100 images selected include:</p>

<p>1: The Look Of Lockdown</p>

<p>By Lotti Sofia. Location, London</p>

<p>Lotti says of the image: 'This is my lockdown pal, Pepter. Lockdown has forced a large majority of us into mandatory stillness. We've felt lonely, sad, worried, confused, anxious and everything in between, but we are grateful for every key worker, our health and for the humanity and empathy that has grown out of this dreary time.'</p>

<p>2: Sami</p>

<p>By Grey Hutton. Hackney, London</p>

<p>Grey says: 'I met Sami on his first day volunteering at a food bank in Hackney. Sami, who is from Sudan, had just moved into an apartment overlooking the food hub. He saw what was happening below, and came down to lend a hand. It's everyday acts of kindness like his that have brought communities together through this crisis.'</p>

<p>3: Everyday Hero Richard</p>

<p>By Arnhel de Serra, London</p>

<p>Arnhel says: 'When I drove past Richard I had to do a double take, as I couldn't believe he was out on his postman's round in fancy dress. Given the doomsday scenario that the media were portraying in the early days of the Covid 19 pandemic, I felt very strongly that here was a man who had something positive to offer his community.'</p>

<p>4: Never Without Her Grandma</p>

<p>By Melanie Lowis, Teddington, south-west London</p>

<p>Melanie says; 'Millie, five, made a cut-out of her much-loved grandma. Millie sees grandma almost daily and lockdown prevented the pair from seeing each other. When lockdown ends, and the real grandma can return, it will be a very emotional reunion.'</p>

<p>5: Thank You</p>

<p>By Wendy Huson, Liverpool</p>

<p>'Wendy says: Our little girl, Amelia, has Down's syndrome. I made her a very simple nurses outfit and then took the picture in our kitchen to celebrate International Nurses Day. We wanted to put a special post on her social media accounts thanking all of the nurses for the amazing work they do every day and especially during the Covid 19 pandemic.'</p>
