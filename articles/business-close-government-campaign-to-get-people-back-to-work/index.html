        <p>The Footsie ended the week in the red, falling below the 6,00 mark, as the pound hit an eight-month high against the dollar, rising above $1.33. </p>

<p>The pound strengthened as the dollar fell across the board in the aftermath of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell steered expectations of lower interest rates for longer.</p>

<p>The FTSE 100 closed down 0.6 per cent, or 36 points, at 5,963, while the FTSE 250 closed up 0.15 per cent, or 26 points, at 17,788. The pound has risen more than 1 per cent against the dollar, with £1 buying $1.334 on currency markets.</p>

<p>The Bank of England's governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank has more ammunition to support the economy during the coronavirus crisis, but it will need to keep enough 'headroom' to deal with future crises. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, a UK Government campaign looks set to be launched next week, encouraging people to get back to the office and get Britain moving again.</p>

<p>The campaign will try and promote the benefits of going back to the office and seek to reassure people about the measures being taken to halt the spread of Covid-19.   </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gatwick Airport has said demand for air travel might not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2025. The West Sussex airport announced a 61.3 per cent fall in revenue and a £321million loss during the first six months of the year compared with the same period in 2019.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, lender Amigo reported a stinging drop in profits for the last quarter, as it halted lending to the vast majority of potential new customers and saw many existing customers take up payment holidays. </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>The FTSE 250 has closed up 0.15%, or 26 points, at 17,788.</p>

<p>Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex, sums up the day for the markets:</p>

<p>It was a muddled Friday, with dollar weakness leading to further divergence between the Dow Jones and its European peers.Suffering from yesterday’s Jackson Hole address from Jerome Powell, and down against the yen following Shinzo Abe’s resignation, the greenback had another rough session. Cable, for example, was up 0.8%, striking a 2020 peak of $1.33.Sterling’s swagger knocked the FTSE to the floor. The UK index dropped 0.7%, slipping to 5970 to sit at its worst price since the start of August.The DAX and CAC, hurt by the euro’s 0.6% rise against the dollar, were also hurt, falling 0.7% and 0.4% respectively.The Dow Jones, meanwhile, sat about doing very little, unchanged at 28500. That keeps it both at a 6-month peak, and roughly 1000 points away from its own all-time highs.</p>

<p>The FTSE 100 is down 0.3%, or 20 points, at 5,979.</p>

<p>The FTSE 250 is still in the green, up 0.2% at 17,791.</p>

<p>As BoE Governor Bailey talks of QE being " temporary" let me remind you it started in 2009 and not one single £ has ever been unwound.....</p>

<p>Some reactions:- Conclusion on covid crisis impact of QE rests on a counterfactual in which March 'dash for cash' would have led to lasting tightening in financial conditions - not clear that the case;- Issue is not whether QE does anything, it's whether it does <em>enough</em>;</p>

<p>High profile speech by @bankofengland Governor Andrew Bailey today at #JacksonHole.Key points: QE works, and works better when markets are volatile. His takeaway is that the BoE needs to build more policy space by unwinding QE ahead of next crisis so can intervene decisively. https://t.co/TeKZ3nhFTv</p>

<p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has finished speaking at the online Jackson Hole conference.</p>

<p>He said the Bank has more ammunition to support the economy from its coronavirus shock, and that big, aggressive bond-buying pushes are most effective when crises strike.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>We are not out of firepower by any means, and to be honest it looks from today's vantage point that we were too cautious about our remaining firepower pre-COVID.</p>

<p>And added:</p>

<p>In the decade ahead, I think we need to take on board the message the COVID crisis has reiterated, namely that our tools may be state contingent in their effects.</p>

<p>And with that in mind, let's not ignore the need to manage central bank balance sheets to enable such state contingency to take effect. There are times when we need to go big and go fast.</p>

<p>The pound has soared above $1.33 for the first time this year today, as the dollar weakened after Fed's chairman Jerome Powell's steered expectations of lower interest rates for longer.</p>

<p>Sterling is currently up 0.6% against the dollar, with £1 buying $1.328 on currency markets. </p>

<p>Against the euro, the pound remained relatively steady, rising 0.15%, with £1 buying €1.1182.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 has opened at an all-time high, lifted by the prospect of super-low interest rates for a prolonged period and hopes of a medical solution to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 opened higher by 10.14 points, or 0.3%, at 3,494.69.</p>

<p>The Dow Jones rose 109 points, or 0.4%, to 28,601.29.</p>

<p>The Nasdaq soared 63.94 points, or 0.55%, to 11,689.28.</p>

<p>Better than for the Footsie. </p>

<p>The AIM All-Share advanced 0.7 per cent to 963, outperforming the FTSE 100 index, up 0.2 per cent to 6,015.</p>

<p>Full story below...</p>

<p>Sub-prime lender Amigo Holdings saw its quarterly profits sink by 83 per cent, new results show.</p>

<p>The company, which dishes out loans to borrowers who struggle to get credit from mainstream channels, said there was 'material uncertainty' about its future as a going concern.</p>

<p>Amigo has been hit hard by the pandemic and halted loans to all new customers except key workers as a result of the crisis. It has also granted payment holidays to 47,000 customers since the pandemic began.</p>

<p>Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at SuMi TRUST, said: 'The resignation of Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe means the end of Abenomics that has driven yen depreciation, which in turn has been a tailwind for exporters and has helped the Japanese market rally since he came to power in 2013.</p>

<p>'The announcement of his departure will likely cause a market correction in the short-term.</p>

<p>'We anticipate the lower limit of the market correction would be 22,000 for the Nikkei 255 and 1,580 pt for the TOPIX which are the 200 days moving averages and are approximately 6% lower than the current levels.</p>

<p>'However, the corrections will be short-lived, and only likely to last a few weeks.'</p>

<ul>
<li><p>FTSE 100 up 0.33% or 19.52 points to 6,019.51</p></li>
<li><p>FTSE 250 up 4.38 points to 17,766.41</p></li>
<li><p>FTSE 350 up 0.27% or 9.24 points to 3,401.52</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has confirmed that he will step down for health reasons.</p>

<p>His health started to decline around the middle of last month, and he does not want to make mistakes in important policy decisions, he said, according to Reuters.</p>

<p>He apologised for stepping down in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, and said he would continue until someone else was appointed, but declined to comment on a successor.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson is set to launch a major campaign to get Britons back to their workplaces.</p>

<p>A drive to champion the virtues of going back to the office and make the 'emotional case' for meeting up with colleagues will start next week, reassuring the public that 'the workplace is a safe place'.</p>

<p>Janet Mui, investment director at Brewin Dolphin, said: 'There are reports that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was elected in 2012 and is the longest serving prime minster in Japan, plans to resign because of health reasons.</p>

<p>'There are a lack of details at this stage but markets will be asking about the implications on Japan’s fiscal and monetary policy. </p>

<p>'Best remembered for “Abenomics”, Abe’s flagship economic programme has three pillars: bold monetary policy, massive government spending and structural reforms to boost productivity.</p>

<p>'Markets will be asking for more clarity on the policy stance of the new government and Abe’s successor. We think the supportive economic policy stance will remain intact because it is hard for Japan to back away from ultra-accommodative measures because of its cyclical and structural growth challenges.</p>

<p>'That said, the budget position, high government debt and the balance sheet of the Bank of Japan may allow little room for a new government to push for bold stimulus measures.</p>

<p>'So far, the third pillar, which is the economic reform part of Abenomics, is lagging and there will be big questions on whether these crucial structural reforms will stall as a result.'</p>

<p>Asset manager Fidelity International has expanded its passive fund range with the launch of a new index UK Government bond and sterling corporate bond fund.</p>

<p>The new additions are the first fixed income funds to be launched in the group's index range which was established in 1996 but has, until now, only ever included funds investing in shares.</p>

<p>The Fidelity Index UK Gilt fund will track the FTSE Actuaries UK Gilts index, while the Fidelity Index Sterling Corporate Bond Fund is benchmarked to the iBoxx GBP Liquid Corporates Large Cap index. </p>

<p>Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: 'Markets haven’t got over-excited by the US Federal Reserve’s new stance on letting inflation run higher, despite it implying that interest rates will stay lower for longer – normally something that would benefit equities.</p>

<p>'One could argue that the Fed following this path was already expected by the market, hence why stocks haven’t surged ahead.</p>

<p>'Parts of Asia followed the small gains seen on parts of Wall Street last night, yet Europe was mostly weak on Friday. The FTSE 100 fell 0.2% to 5,988.</p>

<p>'Japanese stocks fell 1.4%, as measured by the Nikkei 225 index, on talk that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is stepping down for health reasons, subsequently confirmed after Japan’s market close. A change in leader is likely to raise speculation of a shift in strategy to boost the country’s economy and drive inflation.</p>

<p>'On the UK market, financial stocks were the only bright spot with Prudential, Standard Chartered and HSBC leading the way.</p>

<p>'Rolls-Royce continued its descent, falling another 3.4% after yesterday’s disappointing results and heightened speculation that the company will have to do a discounted equity placing to raise money to strengthen its balance sheet.'</p>

<p>On LBC Radio this morning, transport secretary Grant Shapps, said: 'Our central message is pretty straightforward: we are saying to people it is now safe to return to work.'</p>

<p>Landlords and renters are facing a looming meltdown, experts warn, after the Government extended its ban on tenant evictions until 20 September. </p>

<p>In a last minute U-turn over plans for repossession cases to be heard in the courts from 23 August, the Government last week also introduced a minimum six-month notice period for landlords seeking to evict tenants. </p>

<p>Now a group representing landlords across the UK claims these measures could mean some landlords see losses of up to £20,800 over the next two years.</p>

<p>The National Residential Landlords Association has written to the Prime Minister begging him to consider the damage this policy is wreaking on the private rented sector and landlords' ability to keep offering accommodation to renters.</p>

<p>It will take 'four to five years' for passenger numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels, Gatwick Airport has said today.</p>

<p>The West Sussex airport experienced a 61.3 per cent drop in revenue and a £321million loss between January and June, compared with the same period a year ago.</p>

<p>Chief executive Stewart Wingate said Covid-19 had had a 'dramatic' impact on the airport and its operations.</p>

<p>Connnor Campbell, an analyst at SpreadEx, said: 'The FTSE has already been busy, swinging up and down this Friday as the markets digest a report out of Japan that Shinzo Abe is preparing to resign due to health reasons.</p>

<p>'With the Nikkei taking a nosedive, and little else to focus on, the European markets started the session in the red. Their open was also informed by the gains for the euro and pound against the dollar, the currencies rising 0.6% and 0.5% respectively following yesterday’s address from Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell.</p>

<p>'This left the FTSE down half a percent – a swift reversal of the gains it had seen after the bell – and the wrong side of 6000.</p>

<p>'The UK index has really struggled in the second half of August, especially compared to its galloping US peers, and finds itself at its worst level since the very start of the month.</p>

<p>'It will be interesting to see if Bank of England chair Andrew Bailey’s Jackson Hole appearance – far less anticipated than Jay Powell’s – will have any impact on trading. He Zooms in at 2.05pm this afternoon.'</p>

<p>Gatwick Airport is planning to cut 600 jobs, around a quarter of its workforce, as it struggles to cut costs amid the pandemic’s continuing impact on global travel.</p>

<p>The airport is beginning a consultation process with affected employees from all areas of the business, as part of a wider restructuring plan.</p>

<p>Passenger numbers were 80 per cent lower at Britain’s second-busiest air hub during August compared with a year earlier, in what would ordinarily be one of its busiest months of the year.</p>

<p>Coffee and sandwich chain Pret a Manger has axed 2,800 roles from its shops as the coronavirus crisis continues to hammer UK plc. </p>

<p>In a statement released on Thursday, chief executive Pano Christou said the coronavirus pandemic 'has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret'.</p>

<p>He added that the popular cafe franchise had 'managed to protect many jobs' but is 'gutted that we've had to lose so many colleagues'.</p>

<p>It comes after a survey by the Confederation of British Industry found that UK retailers have cut jobs at the fastest rate since the financial crisis in 2009.</p>

<p>Britons will be encouraged to get back to the office as part of a new Government campaign set to launch next week.</p>

<p>The campaign will promote the benefits of returning to the office and seek to reassure people about the safety measures being taken to halt the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Many businesses surrounding travel and office hotspots have been suffering dwindling footfall as people continue to work from home.</p>

<p>The company behind Amigo Loans has reported a massive drop in profit as the company paused most new lending during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Amigo Holdings made a £3million pre-tax profit in the three months ending 30 June, it said today, down more than 83 per cent on this time last year.</p>

<p>Amigo said it is 'on track' to meet a deadline, agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority, to get on top of its complaints backlog.</p>

<p>Last night, the blue-chip index closed below the 6000 mark and this morning remains at a similar level. It is currently down 0.27 per cent or 16.28 points to 5,983.71. The FTSE 250 index is down 0.13 per cent or 22.45 points to 17,739.58.</p>
