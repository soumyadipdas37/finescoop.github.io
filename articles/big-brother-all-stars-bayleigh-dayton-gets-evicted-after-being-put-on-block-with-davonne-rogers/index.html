        <p>Bayleigh Dayton was unanimously voted off Big Brother All-Stars on Thursday in one of the most intense episodes of season 22.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old model had been put up for eviction against her best friend in the house, acting coach Da'Vonne Rogers, 32.</p>

<p>Bayleigh wasn't happy about it after telling Head of Household Christmas Abbott, 35, that Da'Vonne was her 'untouchable,' the person she would never harm, and Christmas used that to make her decision.</p>

<p>Unanimous decision: Bayleigh Dayton was unanimously voted off Big Brother All-Stars on Thursday in one of the most intense episodes of season 22</p>

<p>When Bayleigh confronted her about it, Christmas acted as though she didn't understand.</p>

<p>She let Christmas have it, pulling no punches as she said she'd taken advantage of them.</p>

<p>'You don't get to play victim in this situation,' she told Christmas. 'You used me and you know you used me. And that's what I'm mad about. I'm not gonna let you get away with that.'</p>

<p>Christmas got heated and swore she hadn't 'used' Bayleigh, narrowing the gap between the two of them. That led Bayleigh to say, 'Back up and get your fingers out of of my face.'</p>

<p>Best friends: The 27-year-old model had been put up for eviction against her best friend in the house, acting coach Da'Vonne Rogers, 32</p>

<p>Felt betrayed: Bayleigh confronted Head of Household Christmas Abbott, 35, for betraying her</p>

<p>Back up: Christmas got heated and swore she hadn't 'used' Bayleigh, narrowing the gap between the two of them. That led Bayleigh to say, 'Back up and get your fingers out of of my face'</p>

<p>She waved Bayleigh away dismissively and stomped up the stairs of the house, clapping at her and saying, 'There's a difference between game and personal.'</p>

<p>'I didn't treat you like this, so why are you treating me this way?' Bayleigh yelled.</p>

<p>The dismissive way Christmas departed made the Los Angeles resident furious as she noted that if she had behaved so poorly, 'I would be labeled ghetto-a** Black…'</p>

<p>Different standard: The dismissive way Christmas departed made Los Angeles resident Bayleigh furious as she noted that if she had behaved so poorly, 'I would be labeled ghetto-a** Black…'</p>

<p>Da'Vonne, who'd just had it out with Christmas herself, naturally took Bayleigh's side.</p>

<p>She told her she'd done nothing wrong and that Christmas was grappling with a guilty conscience.</p>

<p>'I let her talk to me crazy for a long time, until I said, ''You know what? I ain't taking s*** no more'',' Da'Vonne added.</p>

<p>Showing support: Da'Vonne, who'd just had it out with Christmas herself, naturally took Bayleigh's side</p>

<p>In a confessional, Da'Vonne said, 'I am 100 percent going home now. I done gave these people what they wanted. They have been waiting, salivating over the day that I blow up.'</p>

<p>In the BB kitchen, Christmas raged to her fellow houseguests: 'Do not f<strong><em>ing leverage this to make me look like a f</em></strong>ing bully.'</p>

<p>'I think you should go to the HoH room,' Kevin Campbell, 40, advised.</p>

<p>Kitchen talk: In the BB kitchen, Christmas raged to her fellow houseguests: 'Do not f<strong><em>ing leverage this to make me look like a f</em></strong>ing bully'</p>

<p>'No, absolutely not—I live here, too, I can go wherever the f*** I want,' Christmas said, as Da'Vonne walked behind her.</p>

<p>'Shut the f*** up, girl,' Da'Vonne shouted at her, as the two of them got into it again, and Bayleigh held her friend back.</p>

<p>'You wanted to provoke me,' Da'Vonne observed. 'I'm provoked.'</p>

<p>Mission accomplished: 'You wanted to provoke me,' Da'Vonne observed. 'I'm provoked'</p>

<p>Da'Vonne and Bayleigh had shared an unbreakable bond over the past few weeks, vowing that they would make it to the final two.</p>

<p>That put them on Christmas' radar, and she chose to nominate them for eviction.</p>

<p>'Bayleigh is definitely my target this week,' Christmas said in a confessional. 'She's a great competitor, and she has the nerve to be able to start coming after my alliance. Bayleigh, I love you, but you gotta go home.'</p>

<p>Target identified: 'Bayleigh is definitely my target this week,' Christmas said in a confessional. 'She's a great competitor, and she has the nerve to be able to start coming after my alliance. Bayleigh, I love you, but you gotta go home'</p>

<p>Da'Vonne, upset, told Christmas that she'd done nothing to warrant being nominated.</p>

<p>'I know,' Christmas replied, explaining that she really wanted Bayleigh. 'But who else was I going to put up beside her? I am your ally, and I want you here.'</p>

<p>'We have you,' she emphasized to Da'Vonne. 'We have you.'</p>

<p>Game decision: 'I know,' Christmas told Da'Vonne, explaining that she really wanted Bayleigh. 'But who else was I going to put up beside her? I am your ally, and I want you here'</p>

<p>Da'Vonne nodded, pretending to be on the same page as Christmas.</p>

<p>In private, she noted, 'Honestly, all she has is my a** on the block, next to my best friend in the house. So I have to smile and grin and take her word for it. But at the end of the day, Christmas is cancelled.'</p>

<p>Christmas' alliance in the house included her own 'untouchable,' Tyler Crispen, 23, who promised Da'Vonne he would try to save her.</p>

<p>Christmas cancelled: In private, Da'Vonne noted, 'Honestly, all she has is my a** on the block, next to my best friend in the house. So I have to smile and grin and take her word for it. But at the end of the day, Christmas is cancelled'</p>

<p>Enzo Palumbo, 42, and David Alexander, 30, tried to keep Bayleigh in the house, believing that she'd be better for their game, but they didn't know if they could get the necessary votes.</p>

<p>In the middle of everything, Cody Calafiore, 29, was asked to go to the diary room, where he was handed a letter.</p>

<p>The moment he read the first line, he dropped the letter and began weeping uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Tough news: In the middle of everything, Cody Calafiore, 29, was asked to go to the diary room, where he was handed a letter</p>

<p>'It's a letter from my family letting me know that my dad's father, my grandfather Pop-Pop, had passed away on Labor Day,' he explained.</p>

<p>'It's just hard not being home. That's the hardest part, being in here when something like that happens and then not getting to be with people that are really close to you.'</p>

<p>Tyler found Cody lying in bed, with his hands over his eyes, and asked him what was wrong.</p>

<p>Family death: The moment he read the first line, Cody dropped the letter and began weeping uncontrollably after learning that his paternal grandfather died</p>

<p>'My grandfather passed away,' Cody said, and Tyler hugged him, as other members of the house trickled in to hear the news.</p>

<p>'Pop-Pop was just always there,' Cody said, as photos of the two of them were shown. 'He never missed holidays, birthdays, graduations, soccer games. He was tough as nails.'</p>

<p>Cody had last seen his grandfather the day before he left for BB All-Stars, and said the man passed away in his sleep while suffering from cancer.</p>

<p>Offering support: Tyler Crispen hugged Cody after learning that his grandfather died</p>

<p>'I love him, and I'm so happy I got to see him before I came here, because it would make it so much harder,' he told the cameras, wiping his tears. 'I don't get to be with my family during something like this. So now it makes winning just that much more important. 'Cause to miss all this and to fall short of the end goal would make it even harder.'</p>

<p>As Cody mourned, Da'Vonne felt the need to set the record straight.</p>

<p>She went to Christmas to explain why Bayleigh had been so upset at being put on the block, pointing out that her pal had really trusted Christmas.</p>

<p>Goal oriented: 'I love him, and I'm so happy I got to see him before I came here, because it would make it so much harder,' he told the cameras, wiping his tears. 'I don't get to be with my family during something like this. So now it makes winning just that much more important. 'Cause to miss all this and to fall short of the end goal would make it even harder'</p>

<p>Christmas argued that there was no personal information on BB, but Da'Vonne didn't buy it, and the two of them began to squabble.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne then strode around the house, crying and saying, 'Control your emotions, 'cause if you cuss her out, everybody's gonna blame you.'</p>

<p>'I hate this game,' she told her housemates. 'Why does she get to talk to me like that, but if I respond, everybody's gonna look at me crazy? She's talking to me like I'm her child!'</p>

<p>Personal information: Christmas argued that there was no personal information on BB, but Da'Vonne didn't buy it, and the two of them began to squabble</p>

<p>Bayleigh then wandered into Da'Vonne's conflict with Christmas, and admitted that she felt like the woman had taken advantage of her.</p>

<p>Their argument spiraled, as Da'Vonne once again got involved.</p>

<p>Before long, it was time for the eviction vote, and both Da'Vonne and Bayleigh argued their case.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne began by thanking God for letting her play a game she loved so much.</p>

<p>Eviction speech: Da'Vonne began her eviction speech by thanking God for letting her play a game she loved so much</p>

<p>She asked for justice for 'Breonna Taylor and every other Black life that has been taken unjustly and unfairly simply because of the color of their skin. All lives can't matter until Black lives matter, and that includes Black trans lives as well.'</p>

<p>Da'Vonne then said that in the house, she had become 'a casualty of something she had not been a part of,' and told Bayleigh the game was temporary, but 'Black girl magic is forever.'</p>

<p>When Bayleigh spoke, she called Da'Vonne her 'sister for life,' and said she'd shown the world 'Black girls don't have to compete; we can love each other and support each other.'</p>

<p>By a vote of nine to zero, Bayleigh was then evicted from the BB house.</p>

<p>Close bond: When Bayleigh spoke, she called Da'Vonne her 'sister for life,' and said she'd shown the world 'Black girls don't have to compete; we can love each other and support each other'</p>

<p>After her departure, Bayleigh spoke to show host Julie Chen-Moonves, 50, and reiterated that Christmas had betrayed her.</p>

<p>'This game is intense enough, and there's no reason to pretend that you have somebody's back… and then turn around and stab them in the back,' she said.</p>

<p>Julie told Bayleigh that Christmas was in an alliance of six people called The Committee, and that Tyler had been her 'untouchable,' the person for whom she would forsake all others.</p>

<p>Exit interview: After her departure, Bayleigh spoke to show host Julie Chen-Moonves, 50, and reiterated that Christmas had betrayed her</p>

<p>Bayleigh said she wouldn't have put Christmas and Tyler up even if she'd known, and said that before elimination, she and Tyler had finally 'squashed' an old beef with each other.</p>

<p>'He admitted to coming after me and sabotaging me,' she explained. 'I told him I don't want anything to do with the drama anymore, and I want to leave it all in the house.'</p>

<p>In their goodbye messages to Bayleigh, Enzo called her 'the sister I never had,' while Tyler said he was happy they had repaired their relationship.</p>

<p>Beef squashed: Bayleigh said she wouldn't have put Christmas and Tyler up even if she'd known, and said that before elimination, she and Tyler had finally 'squashed' an old beef with each other</p>

<p>Christmas appeared onscreen and said she'd loved Bayleigh 'from the minute we chatted for the first time, however me and my alliance teamed up on Week One, so it was just a little too late for us.'</p>

<p>The last message was from Da'Vonne, who told Bayleigh, 'We were supposed to be the final two. This was supposed to be our season, but I promise you, I'm going to finish the race.'</p>

<p>Before she left, Bayleigh said that she had had 'a very rough' emotional experience during her last stint on BB, and wanted to come back to prove that it hadn't defined her.</p>

<p>Socially distanced: Before she left, Bayleigh said that she had had 'a very rough' emotional experience during her last stint on BB, and wanted to come back to prove that it hadn't defined her</p>

<p>As the show ended, all 10 remaining houseguests vied to be the new Head of Household. </p>

<p>The HoH competition, called Power Trip, required houseguests to hold onto a billboard that was tipping to one side. The first three knocked off would become Have-Nots.</p>

<p>The results will be revealed on Sunday's show on CBS. </p>
