        <p>Michael Appleton had his playing career ended at 27 by an operation that went wrong, found himself locked out of the training ground as Portsmouth manager and suffered the hairdryer treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson for taking the Blackburn job.</p>

<p>Now 44, the engaging Lincoln City manager has clocked up nearly 300 games in management and experienced more than many of his peers ever will, yet little could prepare him for the phone calls he had to make this summer to tell players their deals would not be renewed. Such conversations are part of a manager’s lot but these were different.</p>

<p>Social distancing regulations meant Appleton did not speak face to face to the 11 players released. And the world had changed immeasurably: pre-Covid-19, many would have been able to find other clubs. With belts tightening across the EFL, a far scarier future awaits unattached players, who worry about mortgages and bills.</p>

<p>Lincoln City boss Michael Appleton has clocked up nearly 300 games in management</p>

<p>Welcome the new reality in Leagues One and Two, where the pandemic has laid waste to clubs’ income and threatens the existence of many. Apart from the play-offs, there have been no competitive fixtures since March and there is no immediate prospect of crowds returning when matches resume this weekend, with Lincoln facing Oxford – one of Appleton’s former clubs – on Saturday. Job cuts to every department have been the inevitable consequence.</p>

<p>It is a time for strong minds and empathy – and luckily for Lincoln, Appleton ticks both boxes.</p>

<p>‘When you find yourself having to release players through technology, that’s difficult,’ Appleton told Sportsmail. ‘I’m the type who wants to look someone in the whites of the eyes and have that human connection.</p>

<p>‘You know they will be disappointed and angry. It's even harder to tell players they haven’t got a future at the club when you’re not in the same room.</p>

<p>The Manchester United graduate had his career ended at 27 by an operation that went wrong</p>

<p>‘I gave them the option of either speaking over Zoom or over the phone, and most chose the phone as they probably saw [the decision] coming. Everyone was aware that staff were being furloughed and redundancies were happening at the club.</p>

<p>‘Before Covid, I had an idea of how our summer might look and I went from that to having to release 11 players and then trying to rebuild the team. We had to let some players go that in other circumstances we might have kept.</p>

<p>‘We tried to be really transparent with the players throughout lockdown. Our wage bill this year has been cut dramatically and in League One there is a £2.5million salary cap coming in.</p>

<p>‘During lockdown, I tried to make sure I was always at the end of the phone. The biggest thing was to explain it’s good to talk. It could be five or 10 minutes a week or even every day. I make sure all the players have my phone number and if they need to speak to me every day, then fine.</p>

<p>‘In the last two or three weeks of lockdown, the situation was starting to get to me. I was agitated. I just wanted to get back to work, get back on the grass.’</p>

<p>Appleton’s own life was far from easy at that time. His wife, Jess, is due to give birth later this month, and the couple were fearful of her leaving their home at the height of the infection rate. Appleton also attended the funeral of his stepfather during that time.</p>

<p>Appleton suffered the hairdryer treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson for taking the Blackburn job</p>

<p>‘It was weird going to the funeral and because of Covid, there were only a certain number of people allowed in,’ he said. ‘Then, we are expecting a child in September so during the early part of lockdown, Jess was in the vulnerable group so it was worrying.</p>

<p>‘I was the only one leaving the house to do the shopping and that’s quite a scary thing. You want to protect your family and nobody knew how badly the virus might affect pregnant women. It was quite a worrying time.’</p>

<p>While Covid-19 is the most significant crisis to hit football since World War Two, at least Appleton has first-hand knowledge of what the word means.</p>

<p>A promising playing career was cut short when he damaged posterior cruciate knee ligaments during a training session while at West Brom in 2001. A botched operation forced Appleton to retire – he played his last first-team game in November 2003 – and he was later awarded £1.5million in damages, lower than his potential earnings for the rest of his career.</p>

<p>Since then, Appleton – a Manchester United graduate of the Sir Alex Ferguson era – has been in a hurry. He took the Portsmouth job at 35 and went through two periods of administration, sometimes finding the gates to the training ground locked, or that there were no footballs to use for the sessions.</p>

<p>Stints at Blackpool and Blackburn were no less turbulent. At Rovers, Appleton was sacked in writing after 67 days in 2013 by then sporting director Shebby Singh, who he has still never met. Appleton knew he had made a mistake – and the most successful manager in English football history was waiting to tell him so.</p>

<p>He found himself locked out of the training ground during his time in charge at Portsmouth</p>

<p>‘Sir Alex called me into his office and gave me some strong advice, but it was some of the best I’ve ever had.’ Appleton recalls. ‘He said ‘You have to do your due diligence on the people you’re going to work with, instead of taking a job for the sake of it’.</p>

<p>‘Look at how successful he’s been, and for how long he was successful, not just with United but with Aberdeen. For him to give up his time to advise me and help me better decisions says a lot about him as a person, but also about what he thinks of me.</p>

<p>‘It helped me after Blackburn, because I had a couple of opportunities to go back into management but I didn’t. I stayed doing a bit of scouting for various people including Roy Hodgson with England and then when the chance came to take the Oxford job in 2014, it felt right.’</p>

<p>Appleton shone in three years at Oxford with an attractive, expansive style of football that he has started to bring to Lincoln, where he has reduced the average age of the squad to 23. Yet he and his fellow bosses are handling circumstances that even Ferguson might find challenging.</p>

<p>The Imps have been tested periodically during pre-season though preparations remain difficult.</p>

<p>Take the friendly at Salford in August. ‘You have to be masked up when you arrive, only a certain amount of players can go in dressing room at the same time, only a certain amount can shower,’ Appleton explained.</p>

<p>‘You have to stick to social distancing on the benches, which is easy to forget when you’re trying to get a point across.</p>

<p>‘Nobody quite knows what to expect when we start the season for real. You wonder whether the intensity will be there as it should be when there are no fans in the stadium. The Premier League and Championship boys will be used to it but for everyone else it will be new.</p>

<p>‘Yes, we all want to live in a safe environment but having fans in the ground is crucial to the livelihood of every club below the Premier League. The sooner the fans are back, the better it will be for everyone.’ </p>
