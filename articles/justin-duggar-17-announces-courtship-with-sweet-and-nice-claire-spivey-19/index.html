        <p>At just 17 years old, Justin Duggar is officially the youngest in his family to enter into a courtship.</p>

<p>In a preview clip from Tuesday night's episode of Counting On obtained by Us Weekly, the teenager reveals that he is 'now in an official relationship' with 19-year-old Claire Spivey from Texas.</p>

<p>For the Duggar family, a courtship announcement nearly always means that an engagement is in the near future — but in this case, the super-young lovebirds may need to wait until just turns 18 on November 15 before they officially tie the knot.</p>

<p>Puppy love: Justin Duggar has announced that he is in an official courtship with Claire Spivey, 19, from Texas</p>

<p>Just kids! At just 17 years old, Justin is officially the youngest in his family to enter into a courtship</p>

<p>On the approved list: He and Claire 'met at a family conference,' but their families have known each other since before they were born</p>

<p>The preview clip from tomorrow's episode features a family video call, with most of the Duggars joining from their respective homes.</p>

<p>They're all joined by Justin, who still lives with his parents in Arkansas — but made the call from Texas. </p>

<p>'I actually do have some news for the family. And I figure while we're all together I can introduce someone to you guys,' he says before a teenage girl sits down next to him.</p>

<p>'This is Claire and we are now in an official relationship,' he says,</p>

<p>'My big announcement is I'm in a relationship with Claire Spivey,' he adds in another recording. </p>

<p>'Claire is 19 and I am 17. Me and Claire met at a family conference not to long ago. It was several months after, I talked with her dad and asked if I could start a relationship with her. </p>

<p>'She's really outgoing and very sweet and nice,' he says. </p>

<p>Coming up: The preview clip from tomorrow's episode features a family video call, with most of the Duggars joining from their respective homes</p>

<p>'I actually do have some news for the family. And I figure while we're all together I can introduce someone to you guys,' he says</p>

<p>'She's really outgoing and very sweet and nice,' Justin says</p>

<p>'Even though we can't go out to eat all the time or maybe go bowling or something, I think there's other ways we found, just spending that quality time together, maybe it's back at home with the family. We try to be creative and find other ways.'</p>

<p>On the video call, several of Justin's older siblings say they hopes she visits soon.</p>

<p>Speaking to Us Weekly, Justin spoke more about the couple's courtship, which is a term the Duggars use to describe 'dating with a purpose' — that purpose being eventual marriage.</p>

<p>'God brought Claire in my life and I wasn’t really expecting it, but he brought her along right when I needed her,' Justin said. </p>

<p>'Ever since then, I just knew that she was the one. Claire has a lot of good qualities and I can sit here and tell you all of them, but there are so many good things that Is see in her. I’m so blessed to have her in my life.' </p>

<p>Clair added: 'Justin and I’s families have known each other for over 20 years so before he or I were even born, and then we got connected last year.</p>

<p>'God brought Claire in my life and I wasn’t really expecting it, but he brought her along right when I needed her,' Justin said</p>

<p>Justin added: Claire has a lot of good qualities and I can sit here and tell you all of them, but there are so many good things that Is see in her. I’m so blessed to have her in my life'</p>

<p>Claire said: 'Words will never express the depth of my love and admiration for this amazing man!'</p>

<p>'I’m really looking forward to the memories to come spent with him. I’m excited to see what the Lord holds for us in the near future.' </p>

<p>She shared another message about their courtship on Instagram, writing: 'Words will never express the depth of my love and admiration for this amazing man! He is the most tenderhearted person, and every moment spent with him is treasured. </p>

<p>'I’m so thankful for the man of God that he is. Whether we are in person, or long distance, he cherishes and loves me unconditionally. His example to me and all he meets, is unlike any other. I am the most blessed woman on earth to be in a relationship you. I’ll love you forever.'</p>

<p>Nearly all of Justin's older siblings began their courtships at young ages, and were married remarkably young as well.</p>

<p>His oldest brother, sex pest Josh, was just 19 when he entered into a courtship with Anna, who was also 19. They were married at age 20 and now, both 31, have six kids.  </p>

<p>Jessa, now 27, announced a courtship with Ben in September 2013, when she was 20. At 21, she married a then-19-year-old Ben Seewald, and they now have three children.</p>

<p>Little: Sex pest Josh, was just 19 when he entered into a courtship with Anna, who was also 19. They were married at age 20 and now, both 31, have six kids</p>

<p>The rules: Jessa announced a courtship with Ben when she was 20. She was 21 and he was 19 when they married. They are pictured on a double date with his parents during their courtship</p>

<p>Flashback: Jill, now 29, was 22 when she began courting Derick Dillard. Derick asked her officially when Jill visited him in Nepal, with dad Jim Bob tagging along (pictured) </p>

<p>Jill, now 29, was 22 when she began courting Derick Dillard, and they married seven months later. They now have two sons.</p>

<p>Jinger, now 26, was 22 when she married Jeremy Vuolo, who is now 32, and they are currently expecting their second child.</p>

<p>Joseph was 22 when he married a 19-year-old Kendra Caldwell — who is pregnant with their third — and Josiah was 21 when he married Lauren Swanson, then 19. They have one daughter. </p>

<p>Joy Anna was just 19 when she married a 23-year-old Austin Forsyth. They just welcomed their second child.</p>

<p>Only John David was an 'older' groom, marrying Abbie when he was 28 and she was 26.</p>

<p>At 30, John David's twin Jana is still single, as are 21-year-old twins Jedidiah and Jeremiah, 20-year-old Jason, and 19-year-old James. </p>

<p>Parental supervision: Jinger, now 26, was 22 when she married Jeremy Vuolo, who is now 32. They, too, went on supervised dates </p>

<p>Moving fast! Joseph was 22 when he married a 19-year-old Kendra Caldwell — who is pregnant with their third </p>

<p>Just babies! Josiah was 21 when he married Lauren Swanson, then 19 </p>

<p>Longtime friends: Joy Anna was just 19 when she married a 23-year-old Austin Forsyth. They just welcomed their second child </p>

<p>Waiting it out: Only John David was an 'older' groom, marrying Abbie when he was 28 and she was 26 </p>

<p>For the Duggars, a courtship means strict rules governing interaction and physical contact. Justin and Claire will be limited to side-hugs — frontal hugs being too much of a temptation — and will likely save holding hands for an engagement.</p>

<p>The Duggars also wait until their wedding day for their first kiss.</p>

<p>Justin and Claire will always have a chaperone in the room to supervise, though that doesn't have to be someone older or wiser. Younger Duggar siblings, including young children, have served as chaperones for dates in the past, giving the couple 'accountability' so they don't do anything they're not supposed to.</p>

<p>In the past, all text messages between unmarried Duggars and their romantic partners have been in group chats with parents Jim Bob and Michelle there to read everything.</p>
