    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva has said protesters who chanted 'we hope they f***ing die' after two deputies were shot during an ambush in Compton are 'almost worthy of ISIS'. </p>

<p>Villanueva slammed the actions of demonstrators as a 'new low' that America has not encountered before, as he said police had some 'promising leads' on tracking down the gunman. </p>

<p>Two officers - 31-year-old Claudia Apolinar and her 24-year-old male colleague – were shot multiple times as they sat inside their patrol car outside the Metro Blue Line station at Willowbrook Avenue and Oak Street Saturday night. </p>

<p>Shocking surveillance footage captured the moment the black male suspect strolled up to the police cruiser and gunned the officers down at close range before fleeing the scene on foot.</p>

<p>Both officers survived and are in a stable condition in hospital while a massive manhunt continues for the gunman, who authorities said is between the ages of 28 and 30. </p>

<p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said protesters who chanted 'we hope they f***ing die' after two deputies were shot during an ambush in Compton are 'almost worthy of ISIS'</p>

<p>Hours after the shooting, protesters blocked the entrance to St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood where the cops lay fighting for their lives chanting: 'We hope they f***ing die.'  </p>

<p>Footage of the scene outside the hospital shows one protester shouting 'I want to deliver a message to the family of the pigs, I hope they f***ing die' as another tells police: 'Y'all gonna die one by one. This ain't gonna stop.'  </p>

<p>Villanueva, who has denied people of color face different treatment at the hands of law enforcement despite the recent spate of cops killing black people across America, hit out at the protesters in an interview with Fox Tuesday morning where he compared their words and actions to that of terrorist group Islamic State. </p>

<p>'It's just a new low for the hatred that I don't think anyone in this nation has ever seen before,' he said.</p>

<p>'And it's something almost worthy of ISIS across the globe.'</p>

<p>The sheriff voiced shock at hearing such 'hatred' on US soil and vowed that it won't be tolerated. </p>

<p>'We just don't expect it on our own shores and we have been here fighting to save people's lives across the county – it doesn't matter who you are and it is not something we are going to expect or tolerate,' he said. </p>

<p>LVillanueva slammed the actions of demonstrators as a 'new low' that America has not encountered before, as he said police had some 'promising leads' on tracking down the gunman, in an interview with Fox</p>

<p>Villanueva added that there were some 'promising leads' on tracking down the suspect and urged anyone with information to come forward. </p>

<p>His comments come one day after he challenged LeBron James - a vocal supporter of Black Lives Matter - to match the reward money of $200,000 being offered for information on the gunman. </p>

<p>The LA board of supervisors offered $100,000, and an additional $100,000 was donated by private individuals. </p>

<p>'This challenge is to Lebron James. I want you to match that and double that reward,' Villanueva said, speaking on KABC Radio, on the John Phillips Show.  </p>

<p>'I know you care about law enforcement. You expressed a very interesting statement about your perspective on race relations and on officer-involved shootings and the impact that it has on the African-American community.</p>

<p>'And I appreciated that. But likewise, we need to appreciate that respect for life goes across all professions.'  </p>

<p>Villanueva told Fox James had not responded to his appeal, as he again dismissed the idea that black men and women are being targeted by cops across America.  </p>

<p>Protesters blocked the entrance to the hospital where the two deputies ambushed in a shooting Saturday were fighting for their lives, chanting: 'We hope they f***ing die'</p>

<p>'I think that is just flat out not the case,' the sheriff said.</p>

<p>'I think we need to hold those accountable for breaking the law, be it law enforcement when we are crossing the line, but, then we have to acknowledge the bigger problem of violence overall and this ambush, cowardly ambush, of the two deputies just doing their own job, doing their business there in Compton, really illustrates that. </p>

<p>'That is that the problem we need to address.' </p>

<p>Vanessa Bryant, the widow of NBA star Kobe Bryant, blasted Villanueva for his challenge to James in a series of Instagram Stories Monday and hit out at his rejection that the criminal justice system is biased against people of color.</p>

<p>Bryant pointed to a series of articles and tweets criticizing Villanueva and his deputies for leaking graphic photos of the helicopter crash that killed Kobe, their 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others last January.</p>

<p>She shared one post from user @ElanMaree, who wrote: 'How can he talk about trusting the system? His sheriff's department couldn't be trusted to secure Kobe Bryant's helicopter crash scene, his deputies took and shared graphic photos of crash victims. Vanessa Bryant is suing them.' </p>

<p>Bryant then posted an article published in The Hollywood Reporter back in May about a lawsuit that was filed by the union for deputies of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department seeking to keep the internal affairs investigation into the distribution of the crash scene photos private. </p>

<p>Video released by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department shows the moment that male suspect opened fire on two deputies at a Compton bus station before fleeing on foot</p>

<p>FOX11 obtained a photo (above) of the female deputy, who was described as a 31-year-old mother of a six-year-old boy, covered in blood after she was shot in the jaw helping her colleague in the Saturday shooting</p>

<p>Villanueva's refusal to believe there could be any bias against black people from law enforcement comes as outrage is building across America in the wake of a string of recent cop killings of black men and women.    </p>

<p>It has been suggested that Saturday's shooting was a revenge attack for one of these incidents.  </p>

<p>Apolinar, a mother of a six-year-old, and her colleague each sustained multiple gunshot wounds in Saturday's attack. </p>

<p>The two cops - who both graduated from the Los Angeles Police Academy last year - both underwent surgery and are now in a stable condition. </p>

<p>Video released by cops showed the suspect approaching an LACSD vehicle parked outside the Metro Blue Line station and opening fire before he fled.</p>

<p>Despite taking multiple bullets – one to the face and several to her upper torso – Apolinar managed to get her partner to safety, apply a tourniquet and radio for help.</p>

<p>A photo of the aftermath of the attack shows Apolinar covered in blood, giving medical help to her injured partner who was also struck in the head.  </p>

<p>Claudia Apolinar, 31, was identified as one of the gunned down officers. She graduated from the Police Academy last year</p>

<p>A harrowing dispatch call reveals a shaky voice called in the shooting, muttering: '998 Compton Pax.' </p>

<p>Recognizing the code for a deputy-involved shooting, a dispatcher asks: 'Just happened?' </p>

<p>The voice replies, almost unintelligibly, 'Compton Pax, deputies down. Compton Pax 998.'</p>

<p>The suspect, meanwhile, is described as a black male between 28 and 30 years old. </p>

<p>He was wearing dark clothing at the time of the shooting and was last seen in a black four-door sedan.</p>

<p>Fox News reporter William la Jeunesse said Monday: 'Los Angeles police will not say this publicly - but some believe this ambush was retaliation for some recent police shootings of black suspects in LA.'</p>

<p>Vanessa Bryant on Monday took to Instagram to blast LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva over his comments challenging LeBron James to match a $200,000 reward for information on the Compton gunman. Bryant shared a series of unflattering articles and posts about the sheriff's handling of the leak of graphic photos from the scene of her husband's crash  </p>

<p>Bryant shared several posts from user @ElanMaree blasting the sheriff for allegedly protecting his deputies instead of the Bryant family's privacy </p>

<p>On August 31 black man Dijon Kizzee was shot and killed by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies after he was stopped for a traffic violation while riding a bike. </p>

<p>At the beginning of this month the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors also voted to ask the coroner to conduct an inquest into the fatal deputy shooting of 18-year-old Andres Guardado on June 18.  </p>

<p>Thousands have taken to the streets demanding justice and calling for an end to police brutality and racism since May following the 'murder' of black man George Floyd by a Minneapolis cop who knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes until he passed out and died.  </p>

<p>Floyd's death reignited outrage over the death of EMT Breonna Taylor, 26, who was shot eight times while sleeping in her bed when three plain clothes officers performed a no-knock arrest warrant at her Louisville apartment on March 13. </p>

<p>In June, unarmed father Rayshard Brooks was shot dead while he ran away from cops in the drive-thru of a Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta.  </p>

<p>On August 23, Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by a white cop in front of his three young children, leaving the father-of-six paralyzed from the waist down.      </p>

<p>A week later on August 30, Dijon Kizzee, 29, was gunned down in the street by LA cops who allegedly shot him 20 times and then handcuffed his dead body after trying to pull him over for an alleged bicycle code violation.   </p>

<p>In early September, footage was released by the family of Daniel Prude, 41, showing cops in Rochester, New York, putting a spit hood over his face and pushing his face into the ground for two minutes until he passed out and died on March 23.  </p>
