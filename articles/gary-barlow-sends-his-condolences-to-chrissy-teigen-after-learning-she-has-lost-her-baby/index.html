        <p>Gary Barlow sent his condolences to Chrissy Teigen and John Legend on Thursday after learning that they had tragically lost their baby.</p>

<p>The Take That star, 49, whose daughter Poppy was stillborn at full term in 2012, took to Twitter to reach out to the grieving couple after they bravely shared their sad news.</p>

<p>He wrote: 'Sending all my love, strength and best wishes @johnlegend @chrissyteigen no words can make the pain any easier,' followed by a broken heart emoji. </p>

<p>Heartbreaking: Gary Barlow sent his condolences to Chrissy Teigen and John Legend on Thursday after learning that they had tragically lost their baby (pictured in February) </p>

<p>He wrote: 'Sending all my love, strength and best wishes @johnlegend @chrissyteigen no words can make the pain any easier,' followed by a broken heart emoji</p>

<p>Gary and his wife Dawn recently shared an emotional tribute to their late daughter, Poppy, on the eighth anniversary of her death in August.    </p>

<p>Poppy was tragically delivered stillborn at full term on August 4 in 2012 just days before Gary had to perform at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. </p>

<p>Posting a moving picture of himself holding wife Dawn, 50, as they looked out to sea, he penned: 'Thank you for all your kind messages yesterday - we soldier on,' followed by a heartache emoji.</p>

<p>Gary and Dawn have three children together - Daniel, 19, Emily, 18, and Daisy, 11. </p>

<p>Reaching out: The Take That star, 49, whose daughter Poppy was stillborn at full term in 2012, took to Twitter to reach out to the grieving couple after they bravely shared their sad news</p>

<p>Emotional: Gary and his wife Dawn recently shared an emotional tribute to their late daughter, Poppy, on the eighth anniversary of her death in August </p>

<p>Tragic: Poppy was tragically delivered stillborn at full term on August 4 in 2012 just days before Gary had to perform at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympics </p>

<p>Chrissy took to social media on Wednesday to reveal that she and husband John had lost their baby, days after she was admitted to the hospital with severe bleeding. </p>

<p>She shared the heartbreaking news with a lengthy post and series of images, saying their little boy, 'Jack', has died following complications.   </p>

<p>Chrissy wrote: 'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we've never felt before. </p>

<p>'We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn't enough.' </p>

<p>Heart wrenching: Chrissy took to social media on Wednesday to reveal that she and husband John had lost their baby, days after she was admitted to the hospital with severe bleeding </p>

<p>The post included a series of black and white photos taken at the hospital, showing Chrissy crying on her bed as well as a shot showing her and John cradling their son.</p>

<p>As well as Gary, Amanda Holden also reached out to Chrissy after learning that she has tragically lost her baby. </p>

<p>The BGT star, whose son Theo, was stillborn at seven months pregnant in 2011, took to the comments after Chrissy bravely shared her sad news. </p>

<p>One follower had written a lovely post which read: 'In Lebanese culture, we believe babies like Jack are angels that God selectively chooses to watch over you. Sending you light.'</p>

<p>'They are angels that God chooses to look after you': As well as Gary, Amanda Holden, whose son Theo, was stillborn at seven months pregnant in 2011, also reached out to Chrissy</p>

<p>Sharing experiences: Amanda shared the loveliest message after a follower had sent his condolences to Chrissy</p>

<p>Amanda, 49, replied: 'This is how I dealt with my loss.' </p>

<p>The actress recently revealed that Theo's death nine years ago changed her as a person, making her realise how fragile life can be. </p>

<p>Amanda who is also a parent to Alexa, 14, Hollie, eight, with husband Chris Hughes has been very open about her tragic loss. </p>

<p>She previously said about Theo: 'I held him in my arms for the first time and that is when I realised that I was still a mummy even though he was fast asleep.'</p>

<p>On Monday, Chrissy revealed she was on 'serious bed rest' due to bleeding and said she was 'about halfway through', which is around 20 - 24 weeks. A stillbirth is when a baby is born dead at 24 weeks or later. </p>

<p>She revealed she and John, 41, had begun calling their unborn baby boy, 'Jack'. </p>

<p> 'We are shocked': Chrissy's post included a series of black and white photos taken at the hospital, showing her crying on her bed as well as a shot showing her and John cradling their son</p>

<p>She continued: 'We never decide on our babies' names until the last possible moment after they're born, just before we leave the hospital. </p>

<p>'But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack. So he will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever.</p>

<p>'To our Jack - I'm so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn't give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you.</p>

<p>'Thank you to everyone who has been sending us positive energy, thoughts and prayers. We feel all of your love and truly appreciate you. </p>

<p>'We are so grateful for the life we have, for our wonderful babies Luna and Miles, for all the amazing things we’ve been able to experience.' </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In her words: Teigen also penned a lengthy caption explaining the tragedy and expressing her family's grief</p>

<p>Losing a baby past 24 weeks is a stillbirth rather than a miscarriage. If a baby dies before 24 completed weeks, it's known as a miscarriage or late foetal loss. </p>

<p>Shortly after breaking the tragic news to her followers, Teigen took to her Twitter page to further express her shock from the loss. </p>

<p>'Driving home from the hospital with no baby. How can this be real,' she wrote.</p>

<p>The four photos uploaded to Chrissy's Instagram paint a heartbreaking scene, with one of the pictures showing Chrissy crying and cradling Jack in her arms as John leaned next to them.</p>

<p>She said: 'We never decide on our babies’ names until the last possible moment after they’re born, just before we leave the hospital. But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack'</p>

<p>Another featured Chrissy sobbing as she held her hands to her face and sat at the edge of her hospital bed in nothing but a blanket and a bonnet. </p>

<p>Teigen and Legend had revealed they were expecting their third child together in the music video for John's new single, Wild, in August. It is unclear how far along exactly she was in her pregnancy.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two had been hospitalised at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Sunday night after enduring a month of bleeding due to having a weak placenta and had been at the hospital since. </p>

<p>On Monday, she updated fans on her condition in an Instagram post, revealing she had received two blood transfusions and said, 'baby and I are completely fine.' </p>

<p>She said: 'But everyday can’t be full of sunshine. On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it'</p>

<p>Disbelief: Shortly after uploading her undeniably sad news to Instagram, Chrissy took to her Twitter page to further express her shock </p>

<p>'Hello from hospital. about to have my second blood transfusion which truly, truly, truly sounds more dramatic than it is,' she said. </p>

<p>'It's an IV, but instead of fluids, the blood of some kind human being out there. Baby and I are completely fine, just missing the little things like walking...cooking...playing with the other buttbutts.'</p>

<p>Teigen had already been on strict bed rest earlier this month but explained she was admitted to the hospital after her bleeding had worsened. </p>

<p>A stillbirth occurs when a baby is born dead after 24 weeks of pregnancy. </p>

<p>If a baby dies before 24 weeks of pregnancy, it is known as a miscarriage.</p>

<p>Not all stillbirths can be prevented, however, not smoking or drinking, as well as not sleeping on your back and attending all antenatal appointments can reduce the risk. </p>

<p>What are the signs? </p>

<p>Signs may include the baby not moving as much as normal.</p>

<p>Pregnant women should contact their doctor immediately if they notice a difference to their baby's movement. </p>

<p>What are the causes? </p>

<p>Stillbirths do not always have an obvious cause but may occur due to complications with the placenta or a birth defect.</p>

<p>They are also more likely to occur if women suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes or an infection that affects the baby, such as flu. </p>

<p>Stillbirths are more likely to occur if women are having twins or multiple pregnancies, are overweight, smoke, are over 35 or have a pre-existing condition, such as epilepsy.</p>

<p>What happens after a stillbirth? </p>

<p>If a baby has died, women may wait for their labour to start naturally or they may be induced if their health is at risk. </p>

<p>Bereavement support groups are available to parents who have suffered stillbirths.</p>

<p>Some find it helpful to name their baby or take pictures with them.  </p>

<p>Sad: Teigen was hospitalised on Sunday evening after a month of bleeding </p>

<p>'I'm about halfway through pregnancy and the blood has been going on for about a month, maybe a little bit less than a month. We're talking about more than your period girls, it's definitely not spotting. A lot of people spot but it's usually fine. Mine was a lot,' she added.  </p>

<p>'Everytime I go to the bathroom it would be blood, and honestly just laying there there would be blood.'</p>

<p>Despite the scare, she assured her fans she and her baby were doing well and said the her son was 'healthy, growing stronger than Luna or Miles.'  </p>

<p>'He moves so much, so much earlier than they ever did. I'm so excited for him, he's the strongest little dude. He's the strongest coolest dude in the sh***iest house.'</p>

<p>'So his house is like falling apart. It didn't have a good foundation to begin with, he didn't have the strongest chance at the very, very beginning so all we're doing now is trying to make sure he has a lot of fluid around him and I'm resting as much as possible.' </p>

<p>Teigen and Legend, who wed in 2013, are parents to daughter Luna, four, and son Miles, two.</p>

<p>After Chrissy announced the news, some of the couple's closest friends, like Kim Kardashian and Gabrielle Union, voiced their condolences in the comment section.</p>

<p>'We’re always here for you and love you guys so much,' wrote Kim Kardashian, 39, who happens to share four children of her own with husband Kanye West, 43. </p>

<p>Gabrielle Union, 47, made sure that Chrissy and John knew that her family would be there for them during this trying time. 'We love you guys so much and we will be here for whatever yall need. Always,' she commented.</p>

<p>Take away the pain: Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who just became a dad for the first time with husband of seven-years Justin Mikita, 35, said that he wish he could 'take away [Chrissy's] heartbreak'</p>

<p>Paris Hilton, who recently opened up about her own pregnancy plans, said that her 'heart breaks for [Chrissy] and John. 'I am so sorry for your loss. Sending you and your family so much love. Love you beautiful,' wrote the 39-year-old heiress. </p>

<p>Hailey Bieber expressed sympathy for John and Chrissy's unfortunate situation in Chrissy's Instagram comment section. </p>

<p>The 23-year-old model, who is married to Justin Bieber, wrote: 'I’m so so sorry. Thinking of you and John, praying for you guys and sending you so much love during this time.'</p>

<p>Channing Tatum let the couple know that he is 'sending so much love to [them] right now,' while Jersey Shore star Snooki informed Chrissy that she is 'praying for [her] and [her] beautiful family.'  </p>
