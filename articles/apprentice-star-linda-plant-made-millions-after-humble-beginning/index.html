        <p>Hard work: Linda Plant left school at 15 to work full-time in a market</p>

<p>Businesswoman Linda Plant doesn't bother to invest in a pension and only has limited investments in the stock market, preferring to put her money in property and her own ventures. </p>

<p>The multi-millionaire famous for grilling candidates on the BBC TV series The Apprentice told DONNA FERGUSON she has spent lockdown writing a business course and is about to launch her own online business academy and club. </p>

<p>Founding members will get access to live sessions with Linda and the chance to ask her questions. </p>

<p>What did your parents teach you about money? </p>

<p>They never taught me anything about money because we simply didn't have any when I was a child. My father was a tailor and my mother a part-time secretary. Money was tight. </p>

<p>We lived in a small house and they took in a Jewish refugee from Germany as a lodger to make ends meet. He lived with us long after we could afford not to have a lodger, and was part of my family until the day he died. </p>

<p>I had to learn independence at a young age because my mum went out to work. I became a latchkey kid at the age of seven and was cooking for myself by the time I was eight. </p>

<p>The biggest lesson my parents taught me was good values – both about money and about life and relationships. I think good values can carry you through many parts of your life. </p>

<p>What was the first paid work you ever did? </p>

<p>Selling stockings on a Saturday market stall with my mother when I was ten. </p>

<p>If we had a good day I got paid two shillings and sixpence – equivalent to 12.5p. But I didn't care about the money as much as the thrill of selling. Today, I still get that same buzz from doing business. </p>

<p>Have you ever struggled to make ends meet? </p>

<p>No – not as an adult. When I was 12 I encouraged my mum to leave her job as a secretary, borrow money from my grandfather, and work in the market six days a week selling jewellery and handbags. </p>

<p>When I was 15 I left school and began working full-time in the markets – we had three stalls by then and were no longer poor. </p>

<p>I was married at 17. By the time I was 21 and had two children, we had grown the business to 13 stalls. </p>

<p>We then became a fashion wholesale business. So I have n ever struggled. I have always worked for myself and been full-throttle in business. </p>

<p>Have you ever been paid silly money? </p>

<p>No. I sold my first business at the age of 29 for millions of pounds. Then I co-founded an electronics business and sold that in 1988. I did very well then and I've since done well from property, but I've never been paid silly money as a fee for my time. I only give after-dinner speeches to charities and I do so for free. I think it's important to give back. </p>

<p>What was the best year of your financial life? </p>

<p>It was 1988 when I sold the electronics business. That was a great year. It sold for an eight-figure sum which was an even more substantial amount of money back then. </p>

<p>What is the most expensive thing you bought for fun? </p>

<p>A black organza Chanel dress I bought when I was in Paris on business in the 1980s. I had seen it in a magazine. It cost £3,500, but it is worth £25,000 today. Believe it or not, I've still got it and I'll never part with it. It has a satin bow and beautiful big rhinestones. It's just stunning. The fact that little old me from a humble market stall could walk into Chanel in Paris and just buy that dress was one of the biggest thrills of my life.</p>

<p>What is your biggest money mistake? </p>

<p>Not investing in entrepreneur John Hargreaves. He was a customer of mine and in the 1980s he told me he wanted to expand his company. He needed £250,000 for his new venture called Matalan. I had the money, but I decided to invest it in my own business.</p>

<p>I had dinner with John last year and he reminded me that my £250,000 would now be worth around £250million if I had invested it in Matalan. That was a pretty big mistake.  </p>

<p>The best money decision you have made? </p>

<p>Investing in property. My best decision was paying £137,000 for a large warehouse building on Regent Street in Leeds in the 1980s. It's gone up tremendously in value. I converted it into 360 serviced apartments, sold a chunk of them for quite a few million pounds and have hung on to the rest. It provides a great rental income and is now worth quite a bit of money: millions of pounds.</p>

<p>Do you save into a pension or invest in the stock market? </p>

<p>I don't save into a pension and I have limited investments in the stock market. I mainly invest in property because I believe in investing in what I understand and have control over. </p>

<p>So what residential property do you own? </p>

<p>I own two homes: a beautiful three-bedroom apartment right on the ocean in Palm Beach, Florida – and a four-bedroom house in Central London. It has four floors and was built in 1826. It has spectacular views and is worth several million pounds. </p>

<p>What is the one little luxury you treat yourself to? </p>

<p>I love going on a health retreat. I usually go to a well-being beauty spa in Italy twice a year and pamper myself with luxurious treatments. I came back this year two kilos lighter and feeling a lot healthier. </p>

<p>If you were Chancellor, what is the first thing you would do? </p>

<p>I would increase VAT on online sales. I think we need to level the playing field for small businesses on the high street which are fading fast. Around 13million people work in small businesses and I fear for them during this pandemic. During lockdown I have written a business course to encourage people who perhaps have been made redundant and want to set up their own businesses – and to help existing entrepreneurs who might need some guidance during this difficult time. </p>

<p>I'm also launching a CV and business plan critique service and the Linda Plant Business Blueprint Club. For £20 a month, founder members can join the club and ask me questions. </p>

<p>Once a month, I'll give a talk on various business topics. I've set the price at £20 a month so it's accessible to everybody. I've lived through three challenging times during my business career and we're about to enter the fourth one. I want people to be able to afford to access what I've got to offer them.</p>

<p>What is your number one financial priority? </p>

<p>Providing security for my three sons and three grandchildren – and supporting my mother who is 93. She has Alzheimer's, so needs a full-time carer. That's my priority, not having lovely clothes and other luxuries. </p>

<p>As for retirement, I feel ageless. I've got as much energy, drive and motivation today as I had when I was a 12 year-old girl working on a market stall. More information on the Linda Plant Business Blueprint Club at lindaplant. com. </p>
