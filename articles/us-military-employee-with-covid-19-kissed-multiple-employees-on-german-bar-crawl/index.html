        <p>The U.S. military vacation lodge employee with COVID-19 kissed multiple co-workers on her German bar crawl - despite still waiting on her test results, according to one former colleague.</p>

<p>Yasmin Adli, 26, from Florida, is said to have partied with a sore throat for several nights at the beginning of September in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.</p>

<p>Now a former co-worker has also claimed Adli 'kissed multiple Edelweiss Lodge and Resort employees' during one night out at Peaches Bar 'despite not feeling well enough to return to work'.</p>

<p>The worker told DailyMail.com: 'On the night that Yasmin visited Peaches, a huge population of hotel staff and locals packed the bar to bid farewell to departing employees. Despite not feeling well enough to return to work, and still waiting on the results for her test, she kissed multiple employees.'</p>

<p>Adli is facing ten years in jail for going on the night out. In a screenshot of a text message allegedly sent by Adli to other co-workers who partied with her on several nights in the lead-up to her positive test, she thanked them all for coming to her 'rona party' and claimed 'I didn't know I had the rona when we went out'.</p>

<p>Adli, pictured, is said to have kissed several other employees on one of the nights out in the German town before she tested positive for coronavirus. It is not known if those people were infected with coronavirus. Now a former co-worker has also claimed Adli 'kissed multiple Edelweiss Lodge and Resort employees' during one night out at Peaches Bar 'despite not feeling well enough to return to work</p>

<p>Edelweiss Lodge and Resort serves members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families</p>

<p>The former employee claimed, however, that the blame was not entirely on the resort worker but on the defense department owned Edelweiss Lodge and Resort, which is reserved for members of the American military, their families and veterans.</p>

<p>Management are said to have encouraged a 'culture of concealment' that overlooked flaunting of the quarantining rules, the source told DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Attempts made to contact Adli for comment were unsuccessful. She has since deleted her social media profiles, a source confirmed. DailyMail.com has contacted the resort for comment.</p>

<p>Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Michael Weisman told DailyMail.com: 'There have been no formal claims against, or to, Edelweiss Lodge and Resort management to that subject. On the contrary, management there is confident they’ve taken necessary precautions to protect both staff and guests.</p>

<p>'It’s unclear at this moment both from the German and U.S. side how COVID first entered the community and was spread. Identifying this to gain lessons for the future, and to determine if and which violations of Bavarian and military orders occurred, is the purpose of our investigation.'</p>

<p>Adli faces jail time after she was accused of infecting at least 23 others and exposing more than 710 people to the virus through her partying after the Greece trip in early September.</p>

<p>On Tuesday it was reported authorities had recorded three more COVID-19 infections in people who frequented bars visited by the 26-year-old.</p>

<p>Adli is said to have visited the Peaches bar on September 3 and 8 and the Irish Pub in Garmisch on September 4.</p>

<p>The resort is an Armed Forces Recreation Centers (AFRC) Resorts that serve members of the U.S. Armed Forces, their families and other authorized users.</p>

<p>A source told DailyMail.com that a strong drinking culture is fostered at the resort with employees having one last blow-out with friends once their contracts come to an end.</p>

<p>She had also worked in the hotel upon her return, serving guests and staff in the hotel's Cafe and setting up conference rooms until the day she went for a coronavirus test, they said.</p>

<p>Among them was a conference with the United States European Command about preventing the spread of Covid in the US Army. The resort has now shut down for two weeks</p>

<p>A former employee claimed she remained working at the Edelweiss Lodge and Resort, setting up a conference for US military top brass about preventing the spread of coronavirus before she tested positive</p>

<p>The Munich public prosecutor has opened an investigation after the woman, named as 26-year-old Yasmin Adli, went out partying in Garmisch-Partenkirchen while awaiting test results after returning from a vacation in Greece in early September</p>

<p>Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Michael Weisman said: 'All employees that were involved in facilitating the conference last week were screened and tested as part of the contact tracing, and out of precaution all of the leaders who attended have been tested and confirmed negative.</p>

<p>'Per the press statement issued by US Army Garrison Bavaria on Friday, the decision to close the hotel effective Monday was made that day. The hotel contacted inbound guests to advise them of the closure.</p>

<p>'By Sunday, every guest had departed. Any delays of guests departing over the weekend was to allow individual guests to arrange departure travel. Potential exposure to guests was determined by contact tracing through medical professionals to be extremely low.</p>

<p>'As stated by USAG-Bavaria, the hotel is going through additional cleaning to ensure it is ready to resume operations.'</p>

<p>The latest cases recorded Tuesday take the total number of recent infections in the town to 59, including 25 staff at the Edelweiss Lodge and Resort, which is reserved for members of the American military, their families and veterans.</p>

<p>Discussing the punishment a superspreader could face, lawyer Arndt Kempgens said: 'From the point of view of conditional intent, this can even lead to criminal liability for wilful and dangerous bodily harm according to Section 224 of the Criminal Code. The sentence ranges from 6 months to 10 years in prison.'</p>

<p>District Office spokesman Wolfgang Rotzsche added: 'If the woman has actually consciously accepted this risk, then she should also be legally prosecuted.'</p>

<p> Yasmin Aldi from Florida is said to have visited the Peaches bar on September 3 and the Irish Pub in Garmisch on September 4 after her trip to Greece. She went straight back to work after the trip to Greece as well </p>

<p>The woman is said to have visited the Peaches bar, pictured, and the Irish Pub in Garmisch</p>

<p>On Tuesday it was reported authorities recorded three more COVID-19 infections in people who frequented bars Adli visited</p>

<p>US Army spokesman Donald Wrenn previously told Bild: 'For US civilian employees, the Bavarian regulations for the prevention of infectious diseases apply, just like for every German citizen.</p>

<p>'The US Army in Bavaria keeps its soldiers and civilians as well as the Bavarian ordinances with regard to limiting the spread of the virus to a high standard. Any violation of these regulations would be inconsistent with our behavior and our efforts to keep our communities safe.</p>

<p>'Our main focus is currently on the thorough and precise identification of contact persons as well as additional tests to limit the possible spread of COVID-19.'</p>

<p>Bavaria's governor, Markus Soeder, called the outbreak in Garmisch-Partenkirchen 'a model case of stupidity' because the American had gone partying despite having COVID-19 symptoms and awaiting a test result.</p>

<p>Soeder had said 'such recklessness must have consequences' and suggested the woman could receive a stiff fine.</p>

<p>An alleged message thread with employees including Yasmin Adli in which she states: 'I didn't know I had the rona when we went out' and thanks them for going to her 'rona party' after discovering she was infected</p>

<p>Breaching quarantine rules can result in fines of up to 2,000 euros ($2,375), but further penalties and liability for damages are possible if others become infected or businesses suffer economic harm as a result.</p>

<p>Andrea Mayer, a spokeswoman for prosecutors in Munich, confirmed Tuesday that her office had opened a preliminary investigation into the woman on suspicion of causing bodily harm. 'The investigation is ongoing,' she told The Associated Press.</p>

<p>The outbreak has lead to a 10pm curfew on bars and restaurants and a rule that no more than five people can gather in public.</p>

<p>John Tomassi, spokesman for the U.S. Army Europe, said the military is conducting its own investigation into the incident and is recommending any service members or others who had contact with the Edelweiss employee be tested for coronavirus.</p>

<p>The Edelweiss resort has vacation cabins and 258 rooms and suites, but Tomassi said he did not have details on how many people had been staying there over the past two weeks. He said contact tracing was part of the investigation.</p>

<p>Germany has been widely praised for its handling of the pandemic.</p>
