    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Alisson Becker is sitting back in a chair in an open-sided marquee outside the main building at Melwood, the Liverpool training ground. He is a big man but his command comes from the calmness that he radiates, not his size, and when the rain begins to fall, its steady beat on the canvas above our heads seems to fall in line with the rhythm of his words as he speaks.</p>

<p>He is talking about blood and lineage and how his grandfather was a goalkeeper and his father was a goalkeeper and his older brother is a goalkeeper. And he is remembering the times he went to watch his father, who worked as a cutter and stamper in a shoe factory, play for the company team on the rough pitches around Novo Hamburgo, in the south of Brazil, where he grew up.</p>

<p>He smiles when he talks about it, like it is one of his happiest memories. His dad was brave, says Alisson. Brave in the way that goalkeepers have to be. A kind of crazy brave. The kind of brave that makes you laugh. He remembers his dad hurling himself head-first into saves or blocks. 'He didn't care if he needs to go with his face on the ball,' says Alisson. 'He just goes.'</p>

<p>Alisson Becker is dispelling the myth that Brazilian goalkeepers are not up to standard</p>

<p>The Liverpool stopper comes from a family of keepers and grew up idolising Brazilian heroes</p>

<p>There was another time when they were watching Brazil's 1998 World Cup semi-final against Holland at his aunt's house with their family gathered round and the household in tumult. That was the team of Ronaldo and Rivaldo and some saw Claudio Taffarel, Brazil's goalkeeper, as the side's weak link. Back then, we always saw the goalkeeper as Brazil's weak link. Not Alisson's dad, though. He revered him.</p>

<p>That semi-final finished 1-1 and the game went to penalties. Brazil converted their first four and Taffarel was the hero, flinging himself to his right to save from Ronald de Boer and sending his team to the final. A goalkeeper was Brazil's hero. Alisson's dad was so happy he ran into the kitchen, smashed his head into a cake that was sitting on the table and reappeared with icing all over his face.</p>

<p>In those days, Brazilian goalkeepers were regarded as bystanders. Not much more. Just another person admiring what the outfielders were doing. Silent beneficiaries of their brilliance. Nobody really ever wanted Brazil to lose in the Seventies and Eighties but if they did, the goalkeeper was often seen as the only hope. He was the only island of normality in a sea of dazzling yellow beauty.</p>

<p>His hero: Liverpool's Alisson (L) looks up to his big brother Muriel (R), who is also a goalkeeper</p>

<p>Most remember Brazilian icons such as Zico and Pele, but Alisson holds keepers in high esteem</p>

<p>Alisson says Claudio Taffarel paved the way for Brazilian goalkeepers to play in Europe</p>

<p>When we look back affectionately at the Brazil team which won the 1970 World Cup and which, for so many of us, continues to personify the beauty of football, we remember Pele, Tostao, Jairzinho, Roberto Rivelino and Carlos Alberto but which of us remembers who was in goal? Which of us remembers Felix? Which of us remembers that in the bewitching 1982 team of Zico, Eder and Socrates, the keeper was Waldir Peres?</p>

<p>Alisson smiles patiently through all of this. He possesses the kind of easy charm that does not need to imagine slights. 'We don't need to talk about the importance of the goalkeeper,' he says with a grin. 'A team starts with a good goalkeeper.'</p>

<p>He remembers his grandfather talking about Felix. And to him, Taffarel is the man. 'Taffarel is the big guy,' says Alisson, 'the big boss. He was an inspiration for us young goalies and now I have the opportunity to work together with him in the national team because he is the goalie coach.</p>

<p>'He was the first Brazilian goalie to play in Europe. He opened the way for a new generation, for people to look more to Brazilian goalies, the same way me and Ederson are doing that, the same way Dida did that at AC Milan, the same way Julio Cesar did that at Inter. We have to keep showing people the quality of the Brazilian goalies.'</p>

<p>The Liverpool keeper firmly believes that every football team starts with a good goalkeeper</p>

<p>For Alisson, the public perception of goalkeepers in Brazil has transformed in the modern era</p>

<p>Things have changed. Brazilian goalkeepers are no longer regarded with scepticism. They have become the gold standard of the position, partly because they are as comfortable using their feet as their hands and that is what the modern game demands. Alisson, 27, and Manchester City's Ederson, 27 also, are regarded as two of the best goalkeepers in the world. Perhaps the two best of all.</p>

<p>Both are brilliant with the ball at their feet, to the extent where they are almost regarded as an 11th outfielder in their respective sides. Alisson is so comfortable on the ball that he is fundamental to Liverpool's ability to play the ball out from the back and beat an opposition press. And that is before we talk about his shot-stopping ability and the command of his area.</p>

<p>There were many staging posts in Liverpool's journey towards claiming their first league title for 30 years at the end of last season but many cite the key moment as their signing of Alisson from Roma for £67million in the summer of 2018 as a replacement for Loris Karius. It took a Brazilian goalkeeper to shore up an English defence.</p>

<p>A goalie was all Alisson ever wanted to be. 'It's in the blood,' he says. 'There's my dad and my grandfather. My mum played in goal for her school handball team.' He played one outfield session as a midfielder when he was nine and then he headed for a place between the posts and never looked back. His brother, Muriel, was already a promising keeper and Alisson looked up to him. He still does. For a while, they were on the books of Internacional in Porto Alegre at the same time. 'I went to the goal because that is what I loved to do because I always looked to my older brother and saw him being a goalie and wanted to do the same,' says Alisson. 'He is five years older than me and he was, and he is, an inspiration for me. First of all, I admire the way he makes decisions, the way he treats his kids, the way he treats his wife. He is my model together with my father.</p>

<p>And Alisson's £67m arrival from Roma two years ago was a key moment in Liverpool's success</p>

<p>Alisson and fellow Brazilian Ederson are considered as two of the best goalkeepers in the world</p>

<p>'He is not a perfect guy. He has his failures also, as everybody does. I admire his faith in God and he brings that into his life and he has changed his character. It sounds maybe too normal when you say you love your brother, but he's a really nice guy. Even if he wasn't my brother, I would choose him to be my best friend. He is maybe the guilty one for me being a goalkeeper but everyone in my family is a goalkeeper.</p>

<p>'In Brazil, I believe now football is changing and the public view of goalies is changing, too. People are giving more value to the goalies and to your position. It is a lonely position sometimes. Sometimes you feel that you are alone but you are not. We have the goalie coach. He is like our best friend, a second father for us. I love what I do and you have to love what you do. I just love it. I love making saves and helping the team. I love it when we have a busy game and I have to work a lot. Sometimes, I don't have that here at Liverpool because I have a really top team, a really good defensive team, intensive, well organised. It's not just matches that I love. It's working every day in training. It's the challenge of being a goalie.</p>

<p>'Why is it a challenge? Because goalies are different. We have to be different. We have different rules. We wear a different-coloured shirt, we train specifically different from the other players, so it is a completely different world inside the world of football. I love that. I love that challenge. I love what football brings to me. I don't just love being a goalie. I love being a football player.</p>

<p>The word 'crazy' regularly features when Alisson talks about his family of goalkeepers</p>

<p>'Football gives me all I have in my life. I came from a poor neighbourhood and I grew up with football and it gives me the opportunity to be a new man, to change my whole family and it gives me the opportunity to make great things. It's a bit crazy when you think about it.'</p>

<p>Crazy creeps cropping up. 'My dad was a bit crazy as a goalkeeper,' says Alisson. 'Crazier than me. Sometimes goalies have to be.'</p>

<p>The fact, though, is that Alisson does not seem particularly crazy at all. That is one of the things that makes him stand out. He does not come from the Eccentric School of Goalkeeping like, say, one of his predecessors, Bruce Grobbelaar. He inspires with his stillness and calm.</p>

<p>That is one of the reasons why he has been such an important influence on the champions. Nothing rattles him. He is more analytical than emotional. It is difficult to imagine him getting into a shouting match with a team-mate as Hugo Lloris did with Son Heung-min recently and Grobbelaar did with Steve McManaman.</p>

<p>But Alisson has remained cool between the sticks for Liverpool, a reassuring presence</p>

<p>Despite Liverpool's superb title winning season, Alisson says there is still room to improve</p>

<p>Even when Liverpool shipped three goals in their opening-day thriller against Leeds United a fortnight ago, Alisson kept his composure. When Virgil van Dijk made a rare error to gift Leeds their second goal, there was no thought in Alisson's mind of reproaching him for it. That is not his style. It's not how the Liverpool defence works.</p>

<p>'It's my way,' says Alisson. 'I don't like to shout at anybody and I don't like it that anybody should shout at me. When you make a mistake, you know that you make a mistake. We are professionals and we work every day on that. I have made many mistakes already in my life. Sometimes they led to a goal, sometimes they didn't.</p>

<p>'I know what I need to improve and what I need to do differently. So I don't need to tell Virgil or Joe Gomez or Robbo [Andy Robertson] what they need to do differently. We speak to each other about what makes us all more comfortable with our movements but I don't believe that when you concede or make a mistake that you should be pointing the finger at someone. I believe in a different way. You speak in a better way and find a solution.</p>

<p>'We don't need to say that that game against Leeds was a wake-up call. On match day, if things don't happen how we want them to happen, we have to analyse that. We are always looking for what we can improve and that game brought us a lot of those things and we brought that to the next game against Chelsea and we were successful and we kept a clean sheet.'</p>

<p>The hunger to achieve great things is constant for Alisson as Liverpool enter an exciting era</p>

<p>It is instructive, too, that when Alisson talks about the signing of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich, he talks as much about the man as the player. In the quest to defend their title, a feat that has only once been achieved — by Manchester City — in the past decade, Alisson knows Liverpool have reached a stage in their development where character is as important as ability.</p>

<p>'Thiago is an important arrival for us not only because he is new blood but because he is top blood,' says Alisson. 'He is a top player who already has a great history in football, a player with energy who still has the desire to do great things and also a top person who will come here and not bring problems for us but will bring solutions for us and I am really happy we can count on him.</p>

<p>'We have top players here, top people, really good men full of desire to win things and to do great things for this club and the desire to improve is what we need on this team because history says that not many clubs win the title the second year in a row.</p>

<p>'We have the potential and the quality to do that. We know the level of the Premier League is getting higher. Clubs are investing a lot of money in players, they are getting better organised on the pitch. We have to believe in ourselves and we know our quality and our goals but it depends how much we put on the pitch and in the game.</p>

<p>'Last season, we didn't think about winning the title. We put 100 per cent of our focus on the next game and the next challenge. This year, we will do that the same.'</p>
