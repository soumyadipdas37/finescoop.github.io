        <p>Partial lockdowns which discourage eating out and a return by workers to the office could shrink the economy by up to 5 per cent, a think-tank warned yesterday.</p>

<p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research calculated the bill for major restrictions covering sectors such as hospitality at up to £250million a day.</p>

<p>This would mean that national output would shrink by between 3 per cent and 5 per cent over the last three months of 2020 compared to between July and September. </p>

<p>The £250million bill would be a tenth of the impact of full lockdown at its peak in April.</p>

<p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research warned partial lockdowns discouraging eating out (above, The Old Stables Restaurant in Liverpool) could shrink economy by up to 5%</p>

<p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research warned that the UK could suffer if partial lockdowns lead to the public losing faith in the Government's handling of the Covid crisis</p>

<p>But the CEBR has cautioned that the UK could suffer even more if partial lockdowns cause the public to lose faith in the Government's handling of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Douglas McWilliams, of the CEBR, said: 'The bigger cost is the unmeasurable cost – many people feel that progress [so far] going into reverse would knock the stuffing out of consumer and business confidence. </p>

<p>'Whereas the first lockdown was bearable on the assumption that it was temporary, a second lockdown will make many people lose confidence in a recovery in the foreseeable future.'</p>

<p>He added that the end of the furlough scheme – which sees the Government pay part of workers' salaries – on October 31 could also prompt swathes of job losses as 'tens of thousands of businesses are hanging on by a thread and likely to run out of cash'.</p>

<p>He insisted: 'Many people are being kept on not because of their current productivity but so that they will be available when business picks up.</p>

<p>'If people start to lose hope in the economy recovering in the foreseeable future, the knock-on effect could well be a multiple of anything that could emerge from an economics calculation.' </p>

<p>Yesterday, it was reported 1,000 of leisure group Butlin's (above, company safety video) 6,000 staff were at risk of losing their jobs, but bosses stressed a decision has not yet been made</p>

<p>It comes amid a growing backlash at suggestions the Government will impose a 10pm curfew on the hospitality sector to curb the rising Covid-19 infection rate.</p>

<p>The lack of a quarantine-free travel corridor to the US will cost the UK economy £11billion this year, a report reveals today.</p>

<p>Aviation bosses say the failure to reopen trans-Atlantic routes is having a devastating impact, with the hit to UK PLC at £32million a day.</p>

<p>It is also set to cost £45.8billion in lost trade with the US, according to the research by Airlines UK, British Airways owner IAG and aviation services firm Collinson.</p>

<p>Almost 20 per cent of British exports go to the US and in 2018 these were worth £121billion. There are normally four million US visitors every year. They spent a total of £3.8billion during 2019 but that is expected to fall by £3.1billion by the end of the year, the report said.</p>

<p>London to New York is the world's most profitable air link and a vital route for BA and Virgin Atlantic.</p>

<p>But the US is on the Government's 'red' list of countries from which arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days.</p>

<p>Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said: 'This is a stark warning that action is needed immediately to safely open up connections with our key trading partners in the US.'</p>

<p>Stephen Sullivan, of Ziggy's bar in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, where a new local lockdown has been introduced, said imposing a 10pm curfew has already had a dramatic impact on his customers, who normally arrive between 10pm and 2am.</p>

<p>He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend the current situation was 'incredibly difficult', adding: 'We are somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent down on previous weekends. One of my friends had 5 per cent of their normal custom and they've taken the decision already to close and remain closed until such time we are back to normal.'</p>

<p>Asked about what would happen if there was a national lockdown, he said: 'Without financial help, it would be impossible. It would be the end of the road for me.' </p>

<p>There are growing fears of a jobs bloodbath when the furlough scheme ends.</p>

<p>Yesterday, it was reported 1,000 of leisure group Butlin's 6,000 staff were at risk of losing their jobs, but bosses stressed a decision has not yet been made. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, figures collected by think-tank Centre for Cities showed that local lockdowns put the brake on recoveries.</p>

<p>Economists told The Sunday Telegraph that there was now a 'significant risk' of a W-shaped recovery – or double-dip recession.</p>

<p>It came after analysis indicated economic activity in certain cities was dampened by new restrictions to tackle outbreaks.</p>

<p>In some areas, the reimposing of restrictions has stalled or even reversed many recoveries as more companies roll back reopenings.</p>

<p>In Manchester, footfall of shoppers has stalled at half of pre-virus levels in the last month.</p>

<p>The coronavirus restrictions in Leicester caused spending to drop back down to a fifth of normal levels after a brief recovery in the weeks following the end of national lockdown. </p>

<p>In Aberdeen, the bounce-back in footfall faltered after new measures were introduced. The figures there fell from 75 per cent of normal levels to below 50 per cent. </p>

<p>By Eleanor Hayward Health Reporter for the Daily Mail</p>

<p>Experts say the current daily coronavirus death toll is not grounds for a new national lockdown.</p>

<p>The number of deaths from the virus each day remains very far below the peak in April – and also much lower than fatalities from other causes.</p>

<p>Over the last seven days, there have been an average of 21 coronavirus deaths per day.</p>

<p>The current daily coronavirus death toll is on a par with suicide – which claims an average of 18 lives a day, figures from Cancer Research UK and the Office for National Statistics show</p>

<p>This compares to figures above 1,000 on certain days in April when the infection was at its peak in Britain.</p>

<p>And official figures show that Covid-19 is responsible for a tiny fraction of the daily deaths in Britain.</p>

<p>Last year, there were approximately an average of 450 deaths a day from cancer, 214 from dementia and 174 from heart disease.</p>

<p>These figures, from Cancer Research UK and the Office for National Statistics (ONS), would be broadly similar at present.</p>

<p>The current daily coronavirus death toll is more on a par with suicide – which claims an average of 18 lives a day, ONS data shows.</p>

<p>And despite new restrictions being imposed by ministers in various parts of Britain, the country's official coronavirus 'alert level' has not changed since June.</p>

<p>On June 19, the level was downgraded from four to three – on a five-level scale – so restrictions could be 'gradually relaxed'.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the country was still at level 3 –which means transmission of Covid-19 was not deemed 'high or rising exponentially'.</p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the country was still at level 3 but added new restrictions are being brought in because the 'number of cases is shooting up'</p>

<p>But he added: 'We're bringing in new restrictions because the number of cases is shooting up.' </p>

<p>And a leading health expert said it was 'too early' for a second lockdown.</p>

<p>Professor Carl Heneghan, director of Oxford University's centre for evidence-based medicine, said the country 'can't afford to go now with harsh measures'.</p>

<p>He told Sky News that Covid-19 was operating in a seasonal way similar to other respiratory infections, saying: 'If we go now it's too early. As it gets colder, as we're inside more, there will be more coughs and colds.</p>

<p>'If you're looking at a break and when we need it, we need it in the mid-winter when we might run into problems.</p>

<p>'There's no evidence right now of what's called a second wave.'</p>
