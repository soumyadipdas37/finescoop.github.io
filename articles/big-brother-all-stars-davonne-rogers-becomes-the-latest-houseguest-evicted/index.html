        <p>Da'Vonne Rogers was the latest houseguest to leave Big Brother All-Stars after her castmates voted to evict her on Thursday's episode.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old acting coach from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, divided the house, with the final tally in the Diary Room ending up at five to two in favor of keeping Kevin Campbell, 40.</p>

<p>In a surprise reveal, Dr. Will Kirby, 47, the winner of BB2, was then added to the show, serving as the houseguests' new neighbor, who would advise them from his home next door.</p>

<p>Evicted: Da'Vonne Rogers was the latest houseguest to leave Big Brother All-Stars after her castmates voted to evict her on Thursday's episode</p>

<p>Da'Vonne and Kevin: The 32-year-old acting coach from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, divided the house, with the final tally in the Diary Room ending up at five to two in favor of keeping Kevin Campbell, 40</p>

<p>Surprise: In a surprise reveal, Dr. Will Kirby, 47, the winner of BB2, was then added to the show, serving as the houseguests' new neighbor, who would advise them from his home next door</p>

<p>Da'Vonne, who had already starred on BB17 and BB18, made many friends during All-Stars, but was widely considered a threat by others in the house.</p>

<p>In her final plea to continue on, she listed the 'strong Black women' who had previously been strong contenders on BB and said she'd hoped to be the first Black woman to win the show.</p>

<p>'Twenty-one seasons of winners, and not one of those faces look like mine,' Da'Vonne noted. 'When I walked through those doors, I had that desire, that determination, to be the very first face to give hope to those behind me, who have the desire to come in here and play this game.'</p>

<p>Final plea: In her final plea to continue on, she listed the 'strong Black women' who had previously been strong contenders on BB and said she'd hoped to be the first Black woman to win the show</p>

<p>Play the game: 'Twenty-one seasons of winners, and not one of those faces look like mine,' Da'Vonne noted. 'When I walked through those doors, I had that desire, that determination, to be the very first face to give hope to those behind me, who have the desire to come in here and play this game' </p>

<p>'Not seeing a face that looks like mine is very discouraging, it's hurtful, and it does make me feel like maybe it's impossible,' she added. 'But I'm wrong about that, because it's definitely possible. We can do it; it just hasn't been done yet.'</p>

<p>When the episode began, Tyler Crispen, 23, emphasized that Da'Vonne was seen as a clear danger to him and his alliance of six houseguests, called The Committee.</p>

<p>Tyler had won the golden power of veto on Wednesday, but elected not to use it to take either Da'Vonne or Kevin off the block.</p>

<p>Discouraging: 'Not seeing a face that looks like mine is very discouraging, it's hurtful, and it does make me feel like maybe it's impossible,' she added. 'But I'm wrong about that, because it's definitely possible. We can do it; it just hasn't been done yet'</p>

<p>Danger: When the episode began, Tyler Crispen, 23, emphasized that Da'Vonne was seen as a clear danger to him and his alliance of six houseguests, called The Committee</p>

<p>'I see Da'Vonne as a warrior for Dani and Nicole down the line to come after me and people I'm close with,' he affirmed in a confessional, referring to Committee members Daniele Donato, 33, and Nicole Franzel, 28, who seemed to be switching allegiances.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne and Kevin, who were close friends, had chosen Dani and Nicole to play with them in Wednesday's veto competition, suggesting they had some kind of connection.</p>

<p>'It's obvious that this little trio—Dani, Nicole and Da'Vonne—have something major going on behind the scenes,' said Committee member Christmas Abbott, 35.</p>

<p>Warrior: 'I see Da'Vonne as a warrior for Dani and Nicole down the line to come after me and people I'm close with,' he affirmed in a confessional, referring to Committee members Daniele Donato, 33, and Nicole Franzel, 28, who seemed to be switching allegiances.</p>

<p>Obvious: 'It's obvious that this little trio—Dani, Nicole and Da'Vonne—have something major going on behind the scenes,' said Committee member Christmas Abbott, 35</p>

<p>In an unguarded moment, Dani told Christmas that Da'Vonne was not coming for them and seemed like the 'obvious' choice to save that week, which raised Christmas' hackles.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne herself was feeling dispirited as she sensed she'd lose anyway, and she told Kevin that she was 'drained' from having to censor herself with the houseguests all the time.</p>

<p>'Being in here, I'm losing me,' she said. 'When I did my first two seasons, I had so many people reach out to me and say, 'You know, you encouraged me to stand up to my bully. You encouraged me to find my voice. You encouraged me to find my inner strength, and I thank you for being that person.' And I have not been that person this season.'</p>

<p>Dani and Christmas: In an unguarded moment, Dani told Christmas that Da'Vonne was not coming for them and seemed like the 'obvious' choice to save that week, which raised Christmas' hackles</p>

<p>Dispirited: Da'Vonne herself was feeling dispirited as she sensed she'd lose anyway, and she told Kevin that she was 'drained' from having to censor herself with the houseguests all the time.</p>

<p>'I'm going against everything that I have taught these young women to do,' Da'Vonne reflected. 'I'm now doing the opposite. I have these young women telling me, 'Da'Vonne, you encouraged me to find my voice.' And here I am, putting a muzzle on mine.'</p>

<p>In a confessional, she explained, 'This season, I said, 'Da'Vonne, you have to advance in this game. There's a bigger picture. You have to advance in this game. So just be quiet.' Because when you look at a picture of all the winners, there's nobody that looks like me.'</p>

<p>'My mom raised a strong, strong, strong Black queen,' she continued. 'And I'm a little embarrassed because I literally hide my voice… and I feel so bad about it. And I'm just tired.'</p>

<p>Opposite: 'I'm going against everything that I have taught these young women to do,' Da'Vonne reflected. 'I'm now doing the opposite. I have these young women telling me, 'Da'Vonne, you encouraged me to find my voice.' And here I am, putting a muzzle on mine'</p>

<p>Advance: In a confessional, she explained, 'This season, I said, 'Da'Vonne, you have to advance in this game. There's a bigger picture. You have to advance in this game. So just be quiet.' Because when you look at a picture of all the winners, there's nobody that looks like me'</p>

<p>When Dani entered the room, Da'Vonne told her she was sick of acting like a peasant to the assumed 'royalty' in the house. She would not campaign to stay, she added, saying, 'F*** it.'</p>

<p>Kevin, meanwhile, was working on another issue, wondering if David Alexander, 30, had helped vote off their pal Ian Terry, 29, on last week's episode in a 'diabolical' move.</p>

<p>In truth, David had voted to save Ian and get rid of Tyler, while Nicole voted against Ian to keep Tyler and preserve The Committee.</p>

<p>Peasant: When Dani entered the room, Da'Vonne told her she was sick of acting like a peasant to the assumed 'royalty' in the house. She would not campaign to stay, she added, saying, 'F*** it'</p>

<p>Issue: Kevin, meanwhile, was working on another issue, wondering if David Alexander, 30, had helped vote off their pal Ian Terry, 29, on last week's episode in a 'diabolical' move</p>

<p>When Da'Vonne asked Nicole if she'd voted Ian off, Nicole swore she had not—which was a lie.</p>

<p>'I wanna tell Da'Vonne the truth so bad, I just know it'll blow up my game,' Nicole said.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne believed Nicole because the two of them had been repairing their friendship since a fallout in BB18, whereas David had tried multiple times this season to 'sabotage' her.</p>

<p>Liar: When Da'Vonne asked Nicole if she'd voted Ian off, Nicole swore she had not—which was a lie</p>

<p>Blow up: 'I wanna tell Da'Vonne the truth so bad, I just know it'll blow up my game,' Nicole said</p>

<p>As Da'Vonne investigated, Memphis Garrett, 37, schemed to make it to the final two.</p>

<p>The Committee member decided to forge two three-person alliances with Enzo Palumbo, 42.</p>

<p>To foster confusion, he planned to call the alliances by the same name: The Wise Guys.</p>

<p>Memphis and Enzo: The Committee member decided to forge two three-person alliances with Enzo Palumbo, 42</p>

<p>One would include Enzo and Cody Calafiore, 29; the other would include Enzo and Christmas.</p>

<p>Memphis told Christmas they needed to get David on their side and have him vote against Da'Vonne so they didn't become a target for Dani and Nicole in future.</p>

<p>Christmas told David she knew he hadn't voted against Ian, which was a relief to him.</p>

<p>Cody and Christmas: One would include Enzo and Cody Calafiore, 29; the other would include Enzo and Christmas</p>

<p>She knows: Christmas told David she knew he hadn't voted against Ian, which was a relief to him</p>

<p>At the elimination ceremony, both Da'Vonne and Kevin detailed why they should stay.</p>

<p>'Casandra Waldon was the first houseguest to ever walk through those doors,' Da'Vonne began. 'She was a strong Black woman. Danielle Reyes sat in these two chairs, iconic and legendary. She as well was a strong Black woman, and almost won this game. The spin-off version, Celebrity Big Brother, Tamar Braxton, another strong Black woman, won this entire thing by unanimous vote. I had the desire to join that list of women and be the first African-American woman to ever win this game.'</p>

<p>Da'Vonne insisted it could be done—it just hadn't been done yet.</p>

<p>Houseguest: 'Casandra Waldon was the first houseguest to ever walk through those doors,' Da'Vonne began. 'She was a strong Black woman. Danielle Reyes sat in these two chairs, iconic and legendary. She as well was a strong Black woman, and almost won this game. The spin-off version, Celebrity Big Brother, Tamar Braxton, another strong Black woman, won this entire thing by unanimous vote. I had the desire to join that list of women and be the first African-American woman to ever win this game'</p>

<p>'Houseguests, also I want to acknowledge every African-American who has walked through those doors with the same desire to be that face that I have,' Da'Vonne continued. 'I see you, I salute you, and I appreciate you. You came in here, you knew the odds were going to be against you, you knew that it was going to be an uphill battle and you still fought and you fought like hell, and for that, I love you, I acknowledge you and I admire you on today.'</p>

<p>'Houseguests! Biblically, seven is he number of completion,' she said, referring to the fact that it was the show's seventh week. 'So if my time is today, I can honestly say that whatever journey God sent me in here and whatever mission he sent me to do in here, I have completed it and I am done. But I'm not going out without a fight.'</p>

<p>Da'Vonne applauded those who had been honest with her about how the week was going to go, and said she would take it into consideration when she served on the show's jury.</p>

<p>Applauded: Da'Vonne applauded those who had been honest with her about how the week was going to go, and said she would take it into consideration when she served on the show's jury</p>

<p>She pointed out that she'd had a disagreement with Nicole in BB18, but emphasized that Nicole had stabbed her 'in the front' not in the back, like others in the house might do.</p>

<p>'I love my God, I love my child, I love Big Brother, let's play this game!' Da'Vonne concluded.</p>

<p>In his speech, Kevin said, 'I'd just like to take this platform and opportunity to say diversity and inclusion doesn't end with Zoom trainings. There's so much more progress to be made. So if everybody looks up five companies and organizations and their board or leadership doesn't reflect diversity, hold them accountable, because representation matters. That includes gender.'</p>

<p>Love the game: 'I love my God, I love my child, I love Big Brother, let's play this game!' Da'Vonne concluded.</p>

<p>Diversity: In his speech, Kevin said, 'I'd just like to take this platform and opportunity to say diversity and inclusion doesn't end with Zoom trainings. There's so much more progress to be made. So if everybody looks up five companies and organizations and their board or leadership doesn't reflect diversity, hold them accountable, because representation matters. That includes gender'</p>

<p>He thanked Da'Vonne for playing with him, saying he felt like a winner because of it.</p>

<p>In the Diary Room, only Nicole and Dani voted to save Da'Vonne, who seemed resigned to her fate.</p>

<p>When she left, she told show host Julie Chen Moonves, 50, that she had been 'ready to go' because she was sick of people in the house and 'the fakeness' they had displayed.</p>

<p>'I love Kevin, that's one of my great friends, but he can be puppeted,' Da'Vonne said. 'And I can't. When I did my veto speech, I think they realized, 'Oh snap. This is who we saw in Season 17 and 18. We can't do nothin' with that, so let's let her go.'</p>

<p>Great friends: 'I love Kevin, that's one of my great friends, but he can be puppeted,' Da'Vonne said. 'And I can't. When I did my veto speech, I think they realized, 'Oh snap. This is who we saw in Season 17 and 18. We can't do nothin' with that, so let's let her go'</p>

<p>Ready: When she left, she told show host Julie Chen Moonves, 50, that she had been 'ready to go' because she was sick of people in the house and 'the fakeness' they had displayed</p>

<p>In a goodbye message to Da'Vonne, Tyler admitted he was in The Committee and voted against her because he thought that Dani and Nicole were positioning her to come after him.</p>

<p>Nicole cried as she told Da'Vonne she'd had to vote against Ian last week because of her ties to The Committee, and said she hoped they could be friends outside the house.</p>

<p>That upset Da'Vonne, who felt she had been clear with Nicole: As a Black woman, she hadn't wanted to bash David, a Black man, for doing something wrong if he hadn't.</p>

<p>Nicole: Nicole cried as she told Da'Vonne she'd had to vote against Ian last week because of her ties to The Committee, and said she hoped they could be friends outside the house</p>

<p>'That was important for me, and I told her to be honest with me about it,' Da'Vonne sighed.</p>

<p>At the end of the show, Julie brought Dr. Will onto the show to deliver some important news to the houseguests.</p>

<p>'You didn't think you could have All-Stars without me, did you?' he asked.</p>

<p>Will informed the cast that in the next Head of Household and veto competitions, they would have to decide if they were playing for power or for prizes.</p>

<p>'I sure know what I would do,' he said.</p>

<p>Big Brother All-Stars returns Sunday on CBS. </p>

<p>Important: 'That was important for me, and I told her to be honest with me about it,' Da'Vonne sighed</p>

<p>News: At the end of the show, Julie brought Dr. Will onto the show to deliver some important news to the houseguests</p>

<p>All Stars: 'You didn't think you could have All-Stars without me, did you?' he asked</p>

<p>Power or Prizes: Will informed the cast that in the next Head of Household and veto competitions, they would have to decide if they were playing for power or for prizes</p>
