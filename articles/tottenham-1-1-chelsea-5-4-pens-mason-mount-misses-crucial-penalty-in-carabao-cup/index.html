    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Tottenham crept into the last eight of the Carabao Cup last night after beating Chelsea on penalties.</p>

<p>At the end of an absurd tie, Mason Mount missed the 10th kick of the shootout and Spurs went through in a competition written off by Jose Mourinho.</p>

<p>The Tottenham manager had bemoaned a fixture schedule that left them unable to compete for the lesser pickings. But, having gone behind to Timo Werner’s first-half strike, they levelled through Erik Lamela before triumphing in the shootout.</p>

<p>Penalties was an appropriate end for a berserk match of drama, tantrums and, in the case of Eric Dier, an unscheduled toilet break.</p>

<p>It started with Werner’s first goal for Chelsea on 19 minutes, which for the better part of an hour appeared to be enough to put his side through. Spurs had been dreadful for much of the first half but finally managed to apply pressure in the second. They had a flurry of chances, two of which were well saved by Chelsea’s new goalkeeping hope Edouard Mendy, but appeared to be heading out in a blitz of anger.</p>

<p>In one incident, Mourinho rowed with Frank Lampard, before telling the referee in the second half that one of his decisions was ‘f****** s***’. When Dier then disappeared down the tunnel without warning, Mourinho seemed ready to blow, but they were saved by Lamela’s equaliser seven minutes from time.</p>

<p>Despite Tottenham’s win, there will be further questions over the future of Dele Alli. In the ongoing saga of his place at Spurs, he was dropped for a fourth matchday squad out of four. If it is the end for Alli, then what a shame. And what a waste, too.</p>

<p>Of course, it could be just one more twist in the Mourinho shuffle — another cold shoulder to make Alli run hot. Or maybe it is just what it looks like — a loss of trust and the start of a goodbye. With Mourinho, in his world of thick smoke and circus mirrors, it really is so hard to tell.</p>

<p>But the brighter prognosis, that this is all a prelude to a grand revival, does feel a little like wishful thinking. Just as it felt timely when the stadium staff decided partway through the warm-ups to show footage of Alli’s magnificent lob over Arsenal in this competition two years ago.</p>

<p>While that homage to the past played out on the big screens, the newer blood had their chances below. For Spurs, featuring nine changes to cater for their third game in five days, that meant a debut for Sergio Reguilon, at left wing back next to three centre halves in a tweaked system.</p>

<p>Only Dier and Hugo Lloris were retained from the Newcastle draw, but no towels were being thrown in. In the context of selection, they were weakened, but far from weak. So perish the thought that Mourinho may have attempted to mislead with a few of his pre-match comments, but the waiting presence of Harry Kane on the bench suggested his manager held more than a passing interest in going through.</p>

<p>Lampard made eight changes but also put out a strong side, with Mendy given his debut in goal and Ben Chilwell handed a first start.</p>

<p>The upshot of that tinkering? Chelsea dominated. And Spurs let them. Or perhaps that is the kind interpretation of a Mourinho strategy that seemed geared towards counter-attacks but which didn’t deliver on the second part of the brief.</p>

<p>So while Chelsea pushed, and indeed held 71 per cent of the possession for the first 45 minutes, Spurs sat deep, swallowed up what they could, and looked bloated any time they attempted to get off the couch.</p>

<p>The early warnings that might not work came from Mount and Callum Hudson-Odoi, who each saw enough of goal to get off shots.</p>

<p>The breakthrough followed on 19 minutes after an unforced error, and cruelly it was also the opening contribution in a Spurs shirt for Reguilon. His first mistake was to get caught in possession by Cesar Azpilicueta, and he was then quickly dropped on his backside in buying a feint from the Spaniard when attempting his recovery. From there, Azpilicueta rolled low to Werner and the German finished well.</p>

<p>The only sign of life from Spurs came when Mourinho had an entertaining row with Lampard on the sidelines. At one point he told his former player to back off and Lampard held his ground. To think, they all used to listen.</p>

<p>In terms of Spurs chances, it was a limited bunch. One attack that saw Gedson Fernandes close on goal, only for Kurt Zouma to stop him with a tackle of quite brilliant precision. Erik Lamela also got a shot off that Mendy saved well with his feet. Maybe Lampard’s goalkeeping worries are drawing to a close.</p>

<p>He managed a second excellent save early in the second half in rerouting a Reguilon drive over the bar, and by that point Spurs were managing a period of consistent pressure. Both Steven Bergwijn and Serge Aurier had chances in a stretch of 15 or so minutes when Chelsea struggled to break from their half.</p>

<p>But for all the improvement, there was no cigar. Kane came on with 20 minutes remaining and with his only opening, hooked a shot off his left boot over the bar. That appeared to be it for Spurs, before Lamela stretched onto a Reguilon cross and nudged in the equaliser.</p>

<p>The first nine penalties were all converted in order by Eric Dier, Tammy Abraham, Erik Lamela, Cesar Azpilicueta, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jorginho, Lucas Moura and Emerson, before Mount’s kick was saved by Hugo Lloris.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur win 5-4 on penalties</p>

<p>Mason Mount misses</p>

<p>Harry Kane scores</p>

<p>Emerson scores</p>

<p>Lucas Moura scores</p>

<p>Jorginho scores</p>

<p>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg scores</p>

<p>Cesar Azpilicueta scores</p>

<p>Erik Lamela scores</p>

<p>Tammy Abraham scores</p>

<p>Eric Dier scores</p>

<p>We will get underway shortly, Spurs by the way have lost nine of their last 12 shootouts. Are you England in disguise?</p>

<p>For the game itself, that is a fair reflection from the scoreline. Chelsea bossed the first half, but Tottenham's second half response was worthy enough of an equaliser.</p>

<p>This tie went to penalties in the 2019 semi-final - Chelsea coming out on top that evening. Can Mendy help a repeat and become a Chelsea hero on his debut?</p>

<p>The match goes to a penalty shootout</p>

<p>90+1min: We are into three added minutes at WHite Hart Lane, Chelsea applying the pressure.</p>

<p>6 - Erik Lamela has been directly involved in six goals in his last four League Cup starts for Tottenham (3 goals, 3 assists). Equaliser. #TOTCHE #CarabaoCup pic.twitter.com/kngHQGyhlr</p>

<p>86min: Now is the time to remind you that there is no extra-time this evening. This finishes in just over five minutes or it goes to penalty kicks.</p>

<p>84min: Tottenham needed a poacher in front of goal but it's not Kane bringing them level late on, it's Erik Lamela who taps home after latching onto a Sergio Reguilon cross.</p>

<p>82min: We've not seen much of Kane since he came on but he has a half-chance here, cutting onto his left foot before bending his shot off target across goal.</p>

<p>79min: What is going on here?! Tottenham go down to 10 men as Eric Dier runs off the pitch and down the tunnel, with Jose Mourinho running after him!</p>

<p>The defender soon re-emerges with his manager behind as Callum Hudson-Odoi fires just over.</p>

<p>When you've got to go, you've got to go...I guess?</p>

<p>76min: Both sides throw on their final substitutions, with Lucas Moura coming on for Steven Bergwijn for Spurs while Chelsea send on Tammy Abraham for Olivier Giroud.</p>

<p>73min: Big chance for Chelsea to wrap up the game. After winning the ball high up the park, a ball finds Timo Werner inside the box, but his low powerful shot is straight at Hugo LLoris who saves well and holds.</p>

<p>70min: Time for goals in Mourinho's mind and he sends on Harry Kane for Japhet Tanganga. Lampard's response is to throw on N'Golo Kante for Mateo Kovacic.</p>

<p>Sergio Reguilon hasn't had a bad debut but he was well beaten trying to win a sliding challenge on Cesar Azpilicueta in the first half, which led to Chelsea's goal.</p>

<p>66min: Frank Lampard responds with his first change, sending on Emerson for Ben Chilwell at left-back.</p>

<p>63min: First change for Spurs as Gedson Fernandes makes way for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg in the midfield. Chelsea have weathered that early Spurs storm from the start of the half.</p>

<p>62min: The second one soon follows, with Japhet Tanganga booked for pretty much wrestling Mason Mount to ground.</p>

<p>59min: A day late and a dollar short, Aurier picks up Tottenham's first yellow card after a poor sliding challenge on Jorginho.</p>

<p>57min: Chelsea have been asleep at the start of this half but are they now waking up? Jorginho picks the ball up 30 yards from goal but his strike is just off target.</p>

<p>54min: Where was this Spurs intensity in the first half-an-hour? Bergwijn now attacks the right side before squaring alongside the 18-yard box for Aurier</p>

<p>However on his weaker foot he can only turn his shot wide across goal. Encouraging applause from Mourinho on the touchline. His side have been excellent so far in this period.</p>

<p>51min: Better from Spurs, perhaps their best attack of the game. Serge Aurier attacks the right flank, with his low cross fining Sergio Reguilon on the edge of the box. The debutant side-foots with plenty of power first-time but it's too close to Edouard Mendy who does well to turn the ball behind to safety,</p>

<p>49min: Steven Bergwijn was poor in the first half, but he comes alive at the start of this period, blasting just over thebar from the edge of the box.</p>

<p>48min: Chelsea sitting off Spurs at the start of this half, but still mot much intensity in the game so far.</p>

<p>So no Kane for Spurs and no so sign of it either. Mourinho was out early into his dugout for the this period, so his half-time words I gather were sharp brief - or maybe they were just an 'All or Nothing' style Pingu impression. Who knows?</p>

<p>Injuries prevent him featuring but with a lack of attacking options, even a one-legged Bale has to be a consideration at some point for Spurs, no?</p>

<p>Edouard Mendy is making his Chelsea debut this evening and while he has not made any world class saves he has looked assured in his positioning so far, as well as making smart inerventions to deny Gedson Fernandes and Erik Lamela.</p>

<p>Early days I think they call it, but promising signs for Blues supporters.</p>

<p>...but none concern the scoreline. Chelsea are good value for their narrow lead at the break having largely dominated the game, taking the lead with a well struck Werner effort - his first goal for the club.</p>

<p>Spurs have opened up a bit since falling behind but you just get the sense they could play all day and night and not score. Maybe that is why Kane is already looking like he could be introduced at some point.</p>

<p>45+2min: First yellow card of the game, with Mateo Kovacic taking one for the team by bringing down Lamela who was leading a counter attack.</p>

<p>45+1min: Two added minutes at White Hart Lane - get in the bin with that. This half needs to end as soon as possible.</p>

<p>43min: A lacklustre first half is coming to an end and Tottenham could be hinting towards a Harry Kane switch for the second period. He is already putting on his shinpads and pulling his socks up.</p>

<p>40min: Speaking of debuts, Ben Chilwell, on his first start, has looked tidy at left-back for the Blues, having not really been under much pressure down his flank.</p>

<p>Reguilon was at fault for the goal for Spurs but he has been bought for his attacking prowess and he has had a few bright moments. I'm sure he will improve.</p>

<p>35 - Since the start of last season, only Robert Lewandowski (56), Ciro Immobile (40) and Cristiano Ronaldo (40) have scored more goals than Timo Werner (35) for top five European league sides in all competitions. Blue. #TOTCHE #CarabaoCup pic.twitter.com/6pYTAGe186</p>

<p>34min: Better though from Lamela. He turns well inside the box after picking up a Serge Aurier pass, before his low effort across goal is well stopped by Mendy who while hasn't had too much to do, has looked comfortable on his debut.</p>

<p>31min: Dier does look like he is staying on for now, as Tottenham start to show some ambition. It's the same old problem for them though, they don't have a striker on the pitch. Erik Lamela and Steven Bergwijn are putting in a shift, but Harry Kane won't be threatened by competition for places right now, let's put it like that.</p>

<p>28min: About the most exciting thing in this game so far - a touchline spat between Jose Mourinho and Frank Lampard!</p>

<p>It's not quite enough to force the fourth official to get involved between the pair but there is certainly some needle in the words the respective managers are exchanging.</p>

<p>25min: The games are catching up with the Tottenham players it seems. More injury problems it looks like for Spurs with Eric Dier having gone down injured. Davinson Sanchez looks like he is preparing to come on, but Dier is battling on for now.</p>

<p>22min: Out of nowhere - Spurs have a chance! Gedson Fernandes bulldozes his way into the box but he is crucially tackled by Kurt Zouma as Edouard Mendy advances out his goal, and the midfielder cannot get back to his feet to try and turn home the resulting loose ball.</p>

<p>19min: It's been coming. Sergio Reguilon gives the ball away at the back, and after then committing to a slide challenge, he is easily beaten by Cesar Azpilicueta in possession who squares for Timo Werner on the edge of the box, with the striker blasting home his first Blues goal. </p>

<p>18min: Japhet Tanganga makes an error at the back that allows Callum Hudson-Odoi to latch on to a cross but he can't steer a finish past Lloris.</p>

<p>Spurs just cannot get out of their own half.</p>

<p>15min: Well... it counts as a shot. Mason Mount takes up possession 25 yards out but his shot never looked like troubling Hugo Lloris who watches it fly wide.</p>

<p>12min: Chelsea are trying to mix it up in their attempt to break Tottenham down. It's not all short passes, with a few long balls forward testing the centre-backs of Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier. All still quite low tempo stuff though.</p>

<p>9min: This might just be the most uninteresting opening 10 minutes you will see this season. All there is to report is that Chelsea have had 75 per cent of the ball and that Tottenham don't seem to care a jot about it.</p>

<p>6min: Don't think Spurs have been out of their half yet as Timo Werner bends an effort off target. Despite the territorial domination from Chelsea, Spurs don't look too uncomfortable defending.</p>

<p>3min: Quiet old start, save for the 'fake fans' on the TV. Chelsea dictating the play but not much in the way of chances as Gareth Bale looks on from the stands.</p>

<p>A reminder of the teams and formations:</p>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Alderweireld, Dier, Tanganga, Aurier, Fernandes, Ndombele, Sissoko, Reguilon, Bergwijn, Lamela.Subs: Doherty, Hojbjerg, Sanchez, Kane, Hart, Lucas Moura, Davies.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Mendy, Azpilicueta, Tomori, Zouma, Chilwell, Jorginho, Kovacic, Hudson-Odoi, Mount, Werner, Giroud.Subs: Arrizabalaga, Kante, Barkley, Abraham, James, Havertz, Emerson Palmieri.</p>

<p>Referee: Lee Mason (Lancashire)</p>

<p>When asked pre-match on who would be playing up front for Tottenham, Jose Mourinho said: </p>

<p>'Nobody, today we don't have one. Harry [Kane] has a big game on Thursday and we have to protect him.</p>

<p>'The club is making an effort to sign players, I believe we are going to make it happen. we are a different club to others, but today we don't have that No 9.</p>

<p>'We don't have the same conditions as our opponent. we played Sunday, they played Saturday and we play Thursday. We don't have ammunition. But we will fight.'</p>

<p>Can't quite see a scoreline like that at White Hart Lane, but with Timo 'turbo' Werner up against the ageing legs of Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier, he has a big opportunity to bag his first Blues goals following his high profile summer arrival from RB Leipzig.</p>

<p>OTD in 1971 at Stamford Bridge, @ChelseaFC broke a European record which still stands today when they completed a 21-0 aggregate victory over Jeunesse Hautcharage in the European Cup Winners Cup.That record was equalled a year later in the UEFA Cup but has yet to be beaten #CFC pic.twitter.com/4gIX6yIvq3</p>

<p>To those who expect a Tottenham victory this evening, the men in white coats will see you now...</p>

<p>7 - This is the seventh League Cup tie between Spurs and Chelsea and the first since the 2018-19 semi-final, with Chelsea progressing via a penalty shootout after a 2-2 aggregate draw. Foes. #TOTCHE #CarabaoCup pic.twitter.com/yo58FjEEGn</p>

<p>4 - Chelsea have won their last four matches against Spurs in all competitions, their best winning run against their London rivals since a run of six between January 2000 and January 2002. Reunited. #TOTCHE #CarabaoCup pic.twitter.com/t8r2HYgu9v</p>

<p>It's a mad schedule for Tottenham who having played on Sunday now find themselves back in action this evening and again on Thursday night in the Europa League.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho has already thrown in the towel over his side's chances this evening due to their ludicrous fixture pile-up, and that's before you factor in Tottenham's rather poor record against Chelsea...</p>

<p>Chelsea looks like the answer. Just three of their XI from the 3-3 draw at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday retain their place with Mateo Kovacic, Mason Mount and Timo Werner featuring.</p>

<p>New keeper Edouard Mendy will make his debut while summer arrival Ben Chilwell will also make his first Blues start at left-back.</p>

<p>Just two of Tottenham's starting XI feature from their 1-1 draw with Newcastle United on Sunday in Hugo Lloris and Eric Dier. There is however a debut for Sergio Reguilon at left-back following his £30million signing from Real Madrid.</p>

<p>Lloris, Alderweireld, Dier, Tanganga, Aurier, Gedson, Ndombele, Sissoko, Reguilon, Bergwijn, Lamela.</p>

<p>Good evening, Blues! 👋#TOTCHE pic.twitter.com/ZSMATqxYEw</p>

<p>Feels like a day doesn't go past without some sort of major game taking place, and they don't get much bigger than this London derby.</p>

<p>Strap yourselves in folks as Tottenham (or their kids, fringe team?) take on Chelsea to get this week's Carabao Cup fourth round action underway. Good evening and welcome to our live coverage of the 7.45pm kick-off.</p>

<p>The Carabao Cup fourth round gets started with Tottenham hosting London rivals Chelsea following a weekend where both sides had contrasting emotions from their respective Premier League draws.</p>

<p>Spurs were left fuming after a highly controversial penalty in stoppage time against Newcastle denied them a deserved three points, and they head into the cup tie with the headache of another match in the Europa League taking place on Thursday.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard's team meanwhile bounced back from 3-0 down at West Bromwich Albion to draw 3-3 and will now hope to take advantage of Spurs' squad selection issues to seal progress to the quarter-finals.</p>

<p>Sportsmail will provide live EFL Cup coverage of the London derby Tottenham vs Chelsea including score, lineups and build-up.</p>
