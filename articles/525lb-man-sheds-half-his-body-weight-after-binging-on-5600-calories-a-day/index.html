    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>A man has revealed how he dropped more than 250lbs after piling on weight by binge-eating takeout and junk food.</p>

<p>Brock Carrow, from Pembroke Pines, Florida, weighed 525lbs before having a 'lightbulb moment' and deciding to overhaul his lifestyle.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old, who works for Nova Southeastern University, said he had always been 'a bigger guy' with a large frame and was always bigger than the rest of the kids at his school.</p>

<p>Transformation: Brock Carrow, 36, from Florida, has revealed how he shrank his 525lb frame (left) after undergoing a Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy, which helped him lose half his weight</p>

<p>Shrinking: The Nova Southeastern University staffer said he had always been a 'bigger guy' but his weight spiraled out of control after his mother died in 2006</p>

<p>Unhealthy: Brock turned to food for comfort after his mom's death, and he began binging on 5,560 calories a day, indulging in candy, fast food, takeout, and pizza </p>

<p>However, he began piling on the pounds following the tragic death of his mother in 2006, which he said left him feeling partly responsible.</p>

<p>Speaking to Jam Press, he explained, 'I always held it in my head that I could have done something to help her not succumb to alcohol addiction. </p>

<p>'At the time, I was playing music in a relatively successful band in the USA, so I just ignored those feelings and ate them to deal with them. I distracted myself with music and food, which was just a recipe for disaster mentally and physically.'</p>

<p>Brock saw his weight soar after binge-eating entire pizzas, noodles, and takeout, along with plenty of sugary candy.</p>

<p>'It was a very very brutal continuous cycle. I was eating around 5,560 calories a day, and there was no routine; it was just shoveling it in, and barely breathing in between,' he said.</p>

<p>Finally, he decided something had to change after being inspired by a former Navy SEAL.</p>

<p>'I remember the moment I decided to lose weight well, I was reading an article in some paper with a former Navy SEAL, David Goggins, and the drive in his story made me do a little research on him and there was something he said that clicked with me,' Brock explained.</p>

<p>'He said, "When I die and I go before whatever deity that will judge me and they look at my name and in the book it said all these amazing accomplishments I would stop this deity and tell them that they must have my story mixed up with someone else's life. The deity would look at me and say, 'Oh no... that's whom you were supposed to be if you worked harder.'"</p>

<p>'I was floored and started thinking about that for my own life. Laying in bed after pondering on all that, I realized I had three options.'</p>

<p>'Option one was I could continue to eat myself to death, option two was that I could take my own life or option three; I could get up off of my butt and take control of my life.'</p>

<p>Inspiration: He finally became motivated to lose weight after reading a quote from a former Navy SEAL about living a fulfilling life - and he realized he could end up eating himself to death</p>

<p>Pow: After getting a gastric sleeve, Brock found it easier to lose weight - and he found a love of working out, particularly jiu-jitsu, which he started after losing his first 100lbs (left)</p>

<p>Upsetting: Brock says he had been turned down by multiple personal trainers before his surgery, because they didn't know how to work with someone his size </p>

<p>Dangerous: 'Every time I'd go to the gym I'd just wind up hurting myself physically, setting me back for weeks sometimes longer,' he explained </p>

<p>'So I started to do research for personal trainers and ways to help myself. I tried every diet there was, I went vegan, I ate raw, I did fasting, low carb, low sugar, etc,' he said. </p>

<p>'I was turned away by more trainers than I knew what to do with because at 525lbs not too many personal trainers have experience in dealing with someone of that size.</p>

<p>'Afterwards I tried learning myself by studying how to train and eat right. Every time I'd go to the gym I'd just wind up hurting myself physically, setting me back for weeks sometimes longer.'</p>

<p>Eventually, Brock said he decided the only option left was to have a Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy fitted, which he did in April 2017.</p>

<p>'I had to learn that it wasn't a perfect solution. I had to use it like a tool in my tool belt,' he explained.</p>

<p>'I got out of the hospital on Easter of that year and started my new life. I knew that I had about three to four months of leeway to reprogram my brain on nutrition, my eating habits, and my physical activity habits. At the end of that three to four months, I had lost around 60lbs and was in a much better position to start working out regularly without hurting myself.'</p>

<p>Brock began training six or seven days a week, doing light cardio and small amounts of weight training.</p>

<p>'After I had lost 100lbs later that summer, I made a decision that would be massively beneficial to me for the rest of my life. I went and joined a Brazilian/Gracie jiu-jitsu place that is known pretty well around the world,' Brock explained.</p>

<p>'Walking in there as a 425lb man into the doors at Valente Brothers Jiu-Jitsu in North Miami Beach I was worried about how I would be perceived but, luckily for me, they had no bias to not take a chance on someone of my size.</p>

<p>'The instructors, Pedro, Gui, and Joaquim Valente, were welcoming, loving patient, and understanding of my situation. Between the physical training and jiu-jitsu, it pushed me past my perceived limits and shot me out of a cannon to get to my goals.'</p>

<p>Brock now weighs 265lbs and works out regularly, jogging five or six days a week and training with his PT, Brandon Mercado, two or three days a week. He has also built a gym in his garage for the days he does not have personal training sessions.</p>

<p>Intense: Brock now weighs 265lbs (right) and works out regularly, jogging five or six days a week and training with his PT, Brandon Mercado, two or three days a week</p>

<p>Worry: Before his weight loss, Brock says he knew he had to change his lifestyle, or risk eating himself to death </p>

<p>Regimen: Brock maintains a very 'calculated' diet, focusing on low-calorie foods and smaller portions, and anabolic eating - a low-carb diet that helps you to build muscle and stay lean</p>

<p>Message: 'I used to be able to sit around all day and say why I would not do it. Mentally, you have to commit and be driven and focused/disciplined on the things you want to accomplish'</p>

<p>'I also do Jiu-Jitsu three or four times a week which is a fantastic workout. I try to go swimming as much as possible and expand into any physical activity I possibly can.'</p>

<p>He also maintains a very 'calculated' diet, focusing on eating low-calorie foods and smaller portions, and following an anabolic regimen - a low-carbohydrate diet that helps you to build muscle and stay lean. </p>

<p>'I follow the eating of [pro bodybuilder] Greg Doucette who's a bodybuilding pro and on YouTube. He has taught me a new way of eating,' he said. </p>

<p>'For breakfast, I eat anabolic French toast, for lunch its lavish bread flatbread pizzas or a big salad. Snacks are Orville Redenbacher Smart Popcorn and, if I need something sweet, I will make anabolic ice cream which has no dairy but is a lot of protein.'</p>

<p>Since losing the weight Brock says his confidence has never been higher and he now hopes to work for his local police department pending a physical test.</p>

<p>'I'm setting new goals every day that in a thousand years I never thought it would be possible that I could achieve. I push my mind, my body, and my spirit harder than I did the day before.'</p>

<p>As for those who are currently struggling to lose weight, Brock advises, 'I think everyone needs to figure out why they want to lose weight. My why was because I want to achieve my dream career as a Police Officer, I want to get married, have kids, experience new places, people, and live a life worth writing about.'</p>

<p>'I used to be able to sit around all day and say why I would not do it. Mentally, you have to commit and be driven and focused/disciplined on the things you want to accomplish.'</p>

<p>'Also, don't over-complicate things, it's just calories in calories out. If today you can only walk to your mailbox, then do that until you can walk to your neighbor's house. After you get to your neighbors, walk down the street, and just keep it going and build yourself up.'</p>

<p>'Now is the time, tomorrow is too late and yesterday is gone. Stick around and you'll get to see the beauty of what life and choice have to offer for you.'</p>
