    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>The father of murdered toddler James Bulger urged authorities to tell him if his killer Jon Venables has had plastic surgery on the taxpayer to change his appearance.</p>

<p>Ralph Burger wrote to the probation and parole services before a hearing and demanded to be told about any plastic surgery the 38-year-old had received.</p>

<p>Venables and Robert Thompson were aged ten when they murdered the two-year-old boy after snatching him from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993.</p>

<p>And Mr Bulger, 54, told the Daily Mirror: 'Taxpayers' money should not be spent giving a monster protection with a new face.'</p>

<p>He also revealed he had been told Venables had expected to be freed in time for Christmas, adding: 'My child never saw a Christmas beyond his second birthday and I hope Venables rots in his cell for the rest of his days.' </p>

<p>Jon Venables (left) and fellow killer Robert Thompson (right) were given new identities following the murder, which are strictly protected under the terms of a lifelong injunction</p>

<p>Venables and Thompson served eight years in youth detention before being freed on licence with new identities.</p>

<p>But over the past decade Venables has been in and out of prison for possession of pornographic images of children.</p>

<p>James Bulger was murdered in 1993 aged two</p>

<p>He is currently serving a 40-month sentence, handed to him in 2018, after being caught with category A child abuse images – the most serious type. </p>

<p>He also admitted he had a 'paedophile manual'.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Venables was refused parole and will remain behind bars for at least two more years. He cannot apply for parole again until 2022.</p>

<p>Prisoners are normally freed mid-way through their jail term but because Venables is on life licence, he can only be released if the Parole Board agrees. </p>

<p>Speaking yesterday, Mr Bulger said he would 'rest easy' knowing Venables was staying behind bars.</p>

<p>Mr Bulger said: 'This is the first time that the right decision has been made regarding my son's killers.</p>

<p>'By refusing parole, they (the Parole Board) are admitting he is not safe to be released.</p>

<p>James's father Ralph Burger (pictured on ITV's Good Morning Britain in February 2018) wrote to the probation and parole services before a hearing</p>

<p>'I have always said that Venables is a dangerous predatory paedophile and should never be freed from prison, but no one has listened until now.</p>

<p>'They let him out twice before and he has always re-offended. Now the parole officers have seen the light and agreed that he is not safe to be released.</p>

<p>'I can't express how much of a relief that is - I've spent the last few months dreading the phone call to say he was back on the streets.</p>

<p>'Now I can at least rest easy knowing he is banged up for another two years at least.'</p>

<p>Venables was first recalled to prison in 2010 for making and distributing child porn before being released in 2013 under a second new identity.</p>

<p>He was then recalled yet again for breaching the terms of his life licence following his arrest in November 2017, before being sentenced for the most recent child porn offences in February 2018.</p>

<p>He had downloaded more than 1,000 child porn images, including of male toddlers being abused.</p>

<p>A surveillance camera shows the abduction of two-year-old James from the Bootle Strand shopping centre in Merseyside on February 12, 1993</p>

<p>Also in his possession was a 'paedophile manual' detailing how to attack children.</p>

<p>Sentencing Venables at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Edis said Venables's interest in the paedophile manual suggested he was 'at least contemplating the possibility of moving on to actual sexual crime against children'.</p>

<p>Venables passed the half-way point of his sentence in October, but consideration of his parole application was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Parole Board said: 'We can confirm that a panel of the Parole Board did not direct the release of Mr Venables following an assessment of his case.</p>

<p>'Under current legislation Mr Venables will be eligible for a further review within two years. The date of the next review will be set by the Ministry of Justice.'</p>

<p>The decision was made on paper without a hearing, meaning Venables has 28 days to request one in person, although it will not necessarily be granted.</p>

<p>Because of this, details of how the decision was reached will not be published for a month, the Board said. </p>

<p>Jon Venables, pictured as a boy, has been given lifelong anonymity by the courts</p>

<p>Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were found guilty of killing Bulger in November 1993 and were sentenced to custody until they reached 18.</p>

<p>They were freed in 2001, aged 18, and given a new identity to protect him from the risk of vigilante attacks.</p>

<p>They were made the subjects of so-called 'Mary Bell orders', lifetime anonymity court injunctions named after Mary Bell, who was found guilty of killing two boys at a hearing in Newcastle in 1968.</p>

<p>Only six people have been made subject of the orders; Venables, Thompson, Bell, Maxine Carr, who was convicted of perverting the course of justice in the Soham murders, and two brothers who, aged ten and 11, tortured two younger boys in Edlington, South Yorkshire in 2009.</p>

<p>At the time of Venables' first release from prison, a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences.</p>

<p>Years later it emerged Venables had been detained in Vardy House - a small eight-bed section of Red Bank secure unit in St Helens on Merseyside - where it's said he made such good progress he was kept there for eight years, despite it actually being a short-stay remand unit.  </p>

<p>Shortly before his release in 2001, when aged 17, Venables was reported to have allegedly had sex with a woman who worked at the Red Bank secure unit where he was being held. The allegations were investigated and a female staff member accused of sexual misconduct was suspended, never to return.</p>

<p>Venables' release under his new identity went ahead and he is known to have been living independently by March 2002 - some time thereafter beginning a relationship with a woman who had a five-year-old child, although he denies having ever met them.</p>

<p>He was then reported to have had a number of 'younger girlfriends' which suggested he was enjoying a delayed adolescence.</p>

<p>As his supervision was apparently reduced, he developed drinking and drugs problems, and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer.</p>

<p>In September 2008, he was arrested on suspicion of affray after a drunken brawl and was given a formal warning by the probation service for breaching the good behaviour terms of his licence.</p>

<p>Venables and Robert Thompson were freed eight years after they were first locked up</p>

<p>Later the same year, Venables was cautioned for possession of cocaine after he was found with a small amount of the class A drug.</p>

<p>When a probation officer later visited his home in Cheshire to discuss his fears that he could be in danger, he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer.</p>

<p>The hard drive was later examined by police, who discovered that it contained dozens of indecent images of children.</p>

<p>Venables admitted he had posed online as a 35-year-old woman who had abused her eight-year-old daughter, and was returned to prison.</p>

<p>During his latest imprisonment he was given yet another new identity because of the risk posed by a previous security breach. Venables was paroled again in 2013 and took on his fourth new identity.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to 40 months in prison after pleading guilty to having more than 1,000 indecent images of children, in February 2018.</p>
