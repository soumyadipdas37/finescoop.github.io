    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Friends and supporters have rallied around the heartbroken ex-mistress and young son of Dean Jones as the pair grieve the cricket legend's shock death.</p>

<p>The former Australian right-handed batsman died from a massive heart attack in his hotel lobby in Mumbai, India on Thursday aged 59. </p>

<p>Jones leaves behind wife Jane and daughters Augusta and Phoebe, along with a 11-year-old son.</p>

<p>Koby Dean Hamilton, 11, is Jones' son to Kerri-Anne Hamilton- the cricket legend's well documented former mistress.</p>

<p>A 'heartbroken' Ms Hamilton has posted moving tributes on social media and shared photos of Koby with his father.</p>

<p>She was back on Instagram on Monday morning to thank well-wishers for the many messages and gifts she and Koby have been inundated with as they mourn their tragic loss.</p>

<p>The show of support comes after Ms Hamilton was cruelly targeted by online trolls on her Twitter account on Thursday night, where she was called an 'irresponsible woman' and a 'DNA thief'.</p>

<p>Despite being the target of online trolls, Ms Hamilton has also been inundated with gifts as she and her son mourn their tragic loss (pictured) </p>

<p>Koby Dean Hamilton (pictured) is mourning the loss of his dad, cricket great Dean Jones</p>

<p>'Overwhelmed, thanks to all who have reached out. Your messages of support, flowers, cupcakes, chocolates, wine, spinach &amp; ginger Panadol, PS4 vouchers and beer drop offs have not gone unnoticed,' Ms Hamilton captioned a photo of some of the many floral tributes received.</p>

<p>'I am very lucky to have wonderful people around me. Koby and I feel loved and supported.'</p>

<p>A day earlier, Ms Hamilton shared a heartwarming throwback photo of Koby spending some quality time with his father.</p>

<p>Another shows the budding sports star reading a book on cricket tips from his famous dad.</p>

<p>'If you know my son you've probably heard him say, 'do you know my dad is Dean Jones?' Proud is an understatement! He adores him and will no doubt live his life with a bat and ball his hand,' Ms Hamilton wrote on Sunday.</p>

<p>She also shared a heartbreaking photo of Koby kissing a golf ball with Deano 324 written on it.</p>

<p>'When I open my eyes will I see you again? #ripdad,' the photo was captioned. </p>

<p>Kerri-Anne Hamilton shared a sweet throwback photo of her son enjoying time with his dad</p>

<p>Kerri-Anne Hamilton has also shared photos of her and Jones together in happier times</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton also shared photos of the pair during their affair which lasted more than a decade.</p>

<p>'After 22 years the sparklers have gone out. Every time I saw him I had fire in my belly! His love for me, my love for him will never die. I adore you! I am heartbroken,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton said Koby knew Jones 'loved him'.'</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton met the former cricketer when she was working at a golf day in the late 1990s and the pair began an affair.</p>

<p>The married father-of-two would regularly travel from Melbourne to Sydney to see her and the couple enjoyed overseas holidays together.</p>

<p>But in early 2009, Ms Hamilton fell pregnant and by mid-2010 the affair had become public.</p>

<p>'His love for me, my love for him will never die. I adore you! I am heartbroken,' Kerri-Anne (pictured with Jones) wrote.</p>

<p>Dean Jones, pictured with young son Koby, died from a massive heart attack in India last week</p>

<p>Jones, 59, died of a 'massive' heart attack at the Trident Hotel in Mumbai on Thursday, leaving the cricket world in shock and mourning the loss of one of the game's legends.</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton told Sydney Morning Herald she decided to speak out about her former lover's death for her son Koby.</p>

<p>'It's an awful time for his wife and his other kids. I'm not trying to step out of line. I want to speak to you for Koby,' she said.</p>

<p>'I don't want Koby to go to school and for kids to say, ''we didn't see you''. How do we know you were his son. He deserves acknowledgement.'</p>

<p>In the wake of Jones' passing, Koby told Ms Hamilton: 'It's OK, Mum. I know my dad loved me.' </p>

<p>Ms Hamilton said the father and son spoke as recently as two days before Jones' death. </p>

<p>Koby Dean Hamilton, 11, is Jones' son to Kerri-Anne Hamilton - the cricket star's well documented former mistress </p>

<p>Alongside Koby, Jones leaves behind his daughter's Augusta (right) and Phoebe (second from left) - who he had with his wife Jane (left)</p>

<p>The former batsman took his son on a FaceTime tour of the studio he was working at. </p>

<p>Despite only meeting Koby after he was two years old, Ms Hamilton said Jones always checked to make sure the pair were okay.</p>

<p>He would video call his son daily and the duo would discuss all things sport. </p>

<p>Ms Hamilton added Jones will always be her son's hero. </p>

<p>Ms Hamilton initially shared her tale on A Current Affair in 2010 and Jones confirmed the child was his.</p>

<p>'Following an on-and-off relationship with a woman, a child was conceived and subsequently delivered,' he said in a statement at the time.  </p>

<p>In early 2009 Ms Hamilton fell pregnant with Jones' child and by mid-2010 the story was out, with her sharing her tale to A Current Affair leading the former batsman to admit it was his</p>

<p>Jones is seen batting during the 1987 World Cup match against India on October 9, 1987</p>

<p>After a preview for Ms Hamilton's interview with A Current Affair in 2010 referenced a romance with a mystery 'retired cricketer', Jones came out to set the record straight.</p>

<p>'I can confirm that I am the retired cricketer referred to in the A Current Affair preview last night (Friday),' he said in a statement.</p>

<p>'Following an on-and-off relationship with a women (sic), a child was conceived and subsequently delivered. I can also confirm I have supported the mother and child more generously than was agreed.</p>

<p>'At no stage have I not met my obligations.</p>

<p>'My immediate aim is to seek the forgiveness and understanding of family.' </p>

<p>News of Jones' death at the Trident Hotel in Mumbai, India, late on Thursday night Australian time, has left the cricket world in shock and mourning the loss of one of the game's legends.</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton (centre) was a model at the time she met Jones, before becoming an air hostess</p>

<p>Jones had been staying in the Mumbai hotel with Brian Lara (second from right), Graeme Swann, Scott Styris (right) and Brett Lee (second from left) </p>

<p>Jones is pictured with wife Jane (left) and their two daughters, Augusta (right) and Phoebe (second from the left) </p>

<p>The former flashy batsman and 1980s icon was in India commentating on the IPL T20 tournament alongside a host of other retired superstars of the game.</p>

<p>Former Australian bowler Brett Lee was in the hotel lobby with Jones at the time of his heart attack and desperately tried to save him with CPR and a defibrillator. </p>

<p>Jones was rushed to hospital but couldn't be saved.</p>

<p>The pair were in the city as part of Star India's commentary team for the Indian Premier League, which is being played in the UAE because of coronavirus.  </p>

<p>Jones had been staying at the hotel with Styris, Lee, West Indies legend Brian Lara and former England spinner Graeme Swann. </p>

<p>Alongside Koby, Jones leaves behind his daughter's Augusta and Phoebe - who he had with his wife Jane.</p>

<p>Jones' daughter Phoebe said her family is 'broken' in an Instagram post mourning the loss of her father. </p>

<p>She is wearing Jones' cricket cap and sitting on his shoulders grinning, as he looks up at her in awe.</p>

<p>'Our family is eternally grateful to Brett Lee for doing everything he could,' she said.</p>

<p>Phoebe thanked cricket fans across the world who put their bats out in honour of 'Deano'.</p>

<p>'We are overwhelmed with your outpouring of kind words, support and tributes,' she said. </p>

<p>'His legacy will live on in every life he touched. </p>

<p>'I just keep staring at my phone waiting for him to call and tell me this is just a bad dream.' </p>

<p>Jones' daughter Augusta opened up about her heartbreak with a post on Instagram on Friday</p>

<p>The world has been left rocked by the death of cricket legend Dean Jones. His daughter Augusta shared a heartfelt post asking: 'How will I do this without you?'</p>

<p>His other daughter, Augusta shared a series of pictures with her dad as a tribute.  </p>

<p>'I cannot believe I am writing this. My heart is broken, My Dad. My Hero. The sweetest and most caring person you could ever meet,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'If only you could see now how many lives you touched. If only you could see now how loved you were.</p>

<p>'You held my hand through the toughest times this year, how will I do this without you?</p>

<p>'The heavens have opened their gates for another angel. Wait for me dad. Everything I do is for you. I love you Dad.'  </p>

<p>Mourners have offered their condolences to the Jones family (pictured), following the shock death of the cricketing legend </p>
