        <p>Capital Radio DJ Sonny Jay has been confirmed as the sixth celebrity to take part in the forthcoming series of Dancing on Ice. </p>

<p>Sonny broke the news to listeners on Friday morning while presenting  his daily breakfast show that he hosts alongside Roman Kemp and Sian Welby. </p>

<p>He is the latest skater to be confirmed and will join the previously announced Myleene Klass, Joe-Warren Plant, Denise Van Outen, Faye Brookes and Jason Donovan on the show when it launches in January.  </p>

<p>Make way: Capital Radio DJ Sonny Jay has been confirmed as the sixth celebrity to take part in the forthcoming series of Dancing on Ice</p>

<p>Sonny teased his co-hosts during the show with clues including scarves, face glitter and playing the This Morning theme tune hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield also present Dancing On Ice - before finally making the announcement. </p>

<p>He said: 'I'm going to be doing Dancing on Ice! I'm so excited, I don't know how I kept it a secret.' </p>

<p>With training set to begin in October, he added: 'We were talking about it.. we've been talking about Denise Van Outen and Jason Donovan. Move them aside, Sonny's gonna win this!' </p>

<p>With Roman Pointing out that he might take a tumble or two on the ice, Sonny admitted he was keen to avoid making a fool of himself in front of the viewing public. </p>

<p>He said: 'I don't want to fall over, not in front of the nation. I don't want to be a meme the next day'</p>

<p>Get your skates on! Coronation Street star Faye Brookes (L) and former Neighbours star Jason Donovan (R) have been confirmed as the fourth and fifth Dancing On Ice contestants</p>

<p>The announcement comes after Coronation Street star Faye Brookes and former Neighbours star Jason Donovan  were confirmed as the fourth and fifth Dancing On Ice contestants on Thursday.  </p>

<p>Faye, 33, confirmed her involvement in the show during Thursday's edition of Lorraine, while Jason, 52, revealed he was taking part while appearing on This Morning with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.   </p>

<p>Looking ahead to the show, Faye said: 'I'm so excited! We had to review the basic, we were filmed too. </p>

<p>'The producers get to know you and this is the first time I think people are just going to see me, not being a character… Just being me – Faye!'  </p>

<p>The official Dancing On Ice Instagram also confirmed the news and added a statement from the actress, which said: 'I'm a trained dancer, but attempting to put something I already know very well on skates is quite scary!' </p>

<p>During her interview with Lorraine Kelly, Faye also admitted that she already has a 'little' experience as her father used to play ice hockey.</p>

<p>She confessed: 'I have a little, I might be Bambi but my dad used to play ice hockey so we did that often. There were no official lessons but we had fun as a weekend activity.'</p>

<p>Announcement! The actress, 33, who left the cobbles in 2019, now joins Denise Van Outen, Myleene Klass and Joe-Warren Plant as competitors on the ice rink</p>

<p>Her role: Faye left Coronation Street in 2019 after four years of playing Kate Connor on the cobbles (pictured in soap still) </p>

<p>Discussing how the show will be filmed with current guidelines amid the coronavirus crisis, Faye explained: 'They are taking all the precautions, we're just going to have to be safe and careful. </p>

<p>'I'm going to be in a bubble with my pro partner who I still don't know. It's nerve-wracking but still so excited. We need to make sure we'll be keeping everyone safe.'</p>

<p>Faye, who was previously engaged to Gareth Gates, sweetly gushed that she has loved having her personal trainer boyfriend, Joe Davis, by her side during training.</p>

<p>The soap star's ex Gareth, 36, appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2008 where he finished in fourth place with professional skater Maria Filippov. He also appeared on the 2014 show and finished in seventh place with Brianne Delcourt. </p>

<p>Exciting: Appearing on Thursday's episode of Lorraine to announce the news, Faye said: 'I'm so excited! We had to review the basic, we were filmed too.' </p>

<p>She added: 'The producers get to know you and this is the first time I think people are just going to see me, not being a character… Just being me – Faye!'</p>

<p>Exciting: Faye appeared in high spirits as she left Barrys Boot Camp in Manchester following her announcement</p>

<p>Stylish: The actress cut a sporty figure in shiny black leggings but added a boost to her height with suede ankle boots</p>

<p>Casually-clad: She teamed the look with a ribbed jumper and gilet </p>

<p>Thrilled: Faye looked raring to go after announcing she was joining the line-up</p>

<p>She said: 'Ice skating is an Olympic sport, but I'm up for the challenge. Having Joe by my side training has just been the cherry on the cake.'</p>

<p>Faye also revealed that she will be asking for advice from former Coronation Street co-star Brooke Vincent who appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2018.</p>

<p>She joked: 'As soon as this interview is over I can contact them but I've obviously had to keep this to myself. It's the biggest secret I've kept in my life! </p>

<p>'I saw Brooke yesterday and I was desperate to tell her but I thought one more day and I'll be able to. She'll be my first text message after I've finished this interview.' </p>

<p>Experience: During her interview with Lorraine Kelly, Faye also admitted that she already has a 'little' experience as her father used to play ice hockey</p>

<p>Pals: Faye also revealed that she will be asking for advice from former Coronation Street co-star Brooke Vincent who appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2018 </p>

<p>Faye left Coronation Street in 2019 after four years of playing Kate Connor on the cobbles. </p>

<p>Discussing whether she would return, the soap star admitted: 'It's been a year since I've left Corrie. </p>

<p>'I would love to go back and loved my time there, they'll be very shocked by the news but now we can celebrate and look forward to creating something magical.' </p>

<p>Opening up: Jason - who previously took part in Strictly Come Dancing - admitted he is well aware the ice is "not that forgiving" as he discussed his own involvement in the show</p>

<p>Meanwhile Neighbours star Jason - who previously took part in Strictly Come Dancing - admitted he is well aware the ice is "not that forgiving". </p>

<p>Speaking to Dancing on Ice co-hosts Phil and Holly on This Morning, he said: 'I think it's a little bit different than Strictly because that's really defined by the moves that you do. </p>

<p>'Skating is very much the flow and the rhythm of being on the ice. Let's be honest, ice is not that forgiving, and I am 52. I know I look pretty good for it, but that could all change.' </p>

<p>Let's talk: The Australian star spoke to Dancing on Ice co-hosts Phil and Holly on Thursday's edition of This Morning</p>

<p>When Phil joked that Jason would've been "unlikely to smash [his] teeth in" on Strictly like he possibly could on Dancing on Ice, the actor said: 'Thanks for that, Phil. That's a load of encouragement for me.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I've done a little bit of skating in my youth in Australia, surprisingly, in the heat of an Australian summer. I've surfed, I've skied a lot. I guess you bring a little bit of that sort of confidence. </p>

<p>'Doing that in front of five, six, or seven million people is probably a little bit of a difference. To be able to learn a skill and spend some time focused is quite exciting, and I'm looking forward to seeing you guys.'</p>

<p>So far, other stars confirmed for the show include Emmerdale's Joe-Warren Plant, Denise Van Outen and Myleene Klass. </p>

<p>Sweet: Faye, who was previously engaged to Gareth Gates, sweetly gushed that she has loved having her personal trainer boyfriend, Joe Davis (pictured), by her side during training</p>

<p>Twice on the ice! The soap star's ex Gareth, 36, appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2008 where he finished in fourth place with professional skater Maria Filippov. He also appeared on the 2014 show and finished in seventh place with Brianne Delcourt (pictured) </p>

<p>The Loose Women panellists revealed that Denise, 46, would be appearing on Dancing On Ice on Wednesday's show. </p>

<p>However panellist Linda, 62, sadly pipped her to the post by confirming that she is headed to the ice before the big reveal. </p>

<p>By means of hinting, the Loose Women panel opened an array of envelopes including a picture pf Denise Welch, a transit van, and a breakfast fry up - to mark her time on The Big Breakfast - but Linda accidentally barked: 'Van Outen!'</p>

<p>Despite the gaffe, Denise spoke on the show about her new role and her daughter Betsy, 10, saying: 'I'm really excited. Finally, I get to tell people. I've kept this a secret from most of my friends and family. Betsy doesn't even know....</p>

<p>Yay! The Loose Women panellists revealed that Denise, 46, would be appearing on Dancing On Ice on Wednesday's show</p>

<p>'She's at school, so she's going to find out this afternoon when I pick her up from school.. She will be so excited. She loves the show and we watch it every year...</p>

<p>'Literally, I cannot stand up on ice. Every time I've taken Betsy around on a rink I've been the one on the penguin.' </p>
