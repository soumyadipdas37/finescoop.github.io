        <p>Devastating aerial footage shows completely scorched Oregon towns destroyed in a spate of raging wildfires as heartbroken residents return to the charred remains of their homes.</p>

<p>The footage taken Monday shows the decimated towns of Talent and Phoenix where homes are flattened to the ground, pink and red fire retardant is sprinkled over wreckage and driveways, trees are blackened with ash and cars were burnt down to their metal skeletons. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in Oregon on Tuesday as the state reels from powerful blazes that have razed through more than one million acres, destroyed more than 1,000 homes, and left eight dead. </p>

<p>On Monday Governor Kate Brown asked for a Major Disaster situation for a wider range of federal assistance programs for people and infrastructure upgrades after Trump issued an emergency declaration last week. </p>

<p>Devastating aerial footage shows the scorched Oregon town Talent, which was destroyed by the Almeda Fire last week</p>

<p>Homes were flattened to the ground, trees blackened with ash and streets covered with fire retardant in the Almeda Fire in Talent. The blaze still destroyed 600 residences and killed four people</p>

<p>Streets were eerily empty on Tuesday and the sky covered in smoke in Talent, where locals were evacuated due to the blaze</p>

<p>'Oregon is resilient, but to fight fires on this scale, we need all the help we can get. Grateful we've been quickly granted a Presidential Disaster Declaration, helping provide support like damage assessment teams, search &amp; rescue, debris management, shelter &amp; medical assistance,' Gov. Brown tweeted Tuesday. </p>

<p>Earlier this week Oregon’s death toll was 10 but it dropped to at least eight after two sets of remains thought to be human were determined to be animals.</p>

<p>Fifty people remain unaccounted for and 16 people are missing, according to the Oregon Office of management.</p>

<p>This week heartbroken residents slowly returned to their neighborhoods, only to find the blackened, and charred remains of what the fire missed. </p>

<p>Locals in the town of Talent were seen hugging each other and breaking down with emotion as they pilfered through their destroyed posessions.   </p>

<p>Talent and the nearby town of Phoenix were scorched in the Almeda Fire that started on August 8 and burned through 5,716 acres and is now 100 percent contained.</p>

<p>The blaze destroyed 600 residences and 100 other structures and killed four.</p>

<p>In Marion County the area is reeling from the massive Lionshead and Beachie Creek fires that may merge with the Riverside fire in Clackamas County.</p>

<p>Gov. Kate Brown thanked Donald Trump Tuesday for declaring a major disaster to get extra federal assistance as the state reels from a spate of wildfires</p>

<p>On Monday fire crews did their best to maintain a 30,000-acre ‘finger of timber’ between them, according to Oregon Live.</p>

<p>The Beachie Creek wildfire has grown to over 190,000 acres and is 20 percent contained and has killed four as of Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>The Lionshead fire that was sparked by lightning and is located west of Warm Springs has spread to 168,097 acres and is just five percent contained. From Monday to Tuesday alone the blaze grew 19,415 acres.</p>

<p>Across the western US, at least 87 wildfires are burning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.  </p>

<p>California, Oregon and Washington state are all reeling from historic fires that have sent smoke all the way across the country reaching the Midwest, New York and even Canada. </p>

<p>In Oregon eight people have been killed, in California 25 people have died and one person was killed in Washington state. In California, where more than 16,500 firefighters are battling 28 major wildfires. </p>

<p>Meanwhile residents of Oregon, Washington and California are suffering the worst, most unhealthy air on the planet according to some measurements under the swathe of yellow and orange smog. In those states the air quality is considered hazardous, according to AirNow, an air quality database maintained by government agencies. </p>

<p>Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality extended an air quality alert to Thursday after it was to initially expire on Monday. </p>

<p>'I grew up in Oregon and lived here a long time, and to see this much smoke for this long and wide spreading, really stands out in the state’s history,' Dylan Darling, a spokesman for the state’s department of Environmental Quality, said. </p>

<p>Some areas in central California suffering from smoke may not see relief until October, according to Dan Borsum, an incident meteorologist for a fire in Northern, California. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump met with California officials to discuss the wildfires on Monday in Sacramento where he defied comments about global warming </p>

<p>Oregon State police opened the first-ever mobile morgue in response to the devastating wildfires, setting it up in Linn County.</p>

<p>A separate facility is expected to open this week where families of the dead and missing can undergo rapid DNA testing to aid in identification, according to Oregon Live.</p>

<p>The state has activated a 75-member regional response team to recover remains in the field and operate the mobile morgue.  </p>

<p>Oregon State Police Capt. Tim Fox said the state opened the facility to ease the burden on local medical examiners’ offices and to quickly identify remains 'so we can give family members closure as soon as possible. We understand this is a super tragic event. We understand this is hard.'</p>

<p>Clackamas County Sheriff Crag Roberts said Monday that his agency responded to more than 330 calls for service over the past week – a 400 percent increase from the previous week of people trying to protect their property or threatening others armed with guns. Some locals have erected signs like this one saying: 'You loot we shoot'</p>

<p>Clackamas County Sheriff Crag Roberts said Monday that his agency responded to more than 330 calls for service over the past week – a 400 percent increase from the previous week.</p>

<p>'We have a group of different individuals that are actually trying to protect property. They actually have been armed and are stopping individuals within the commune out there. First thing I’d ask them to do is please stop that. We have reached out to a number of them. If they see somebody suspicious, call us. Let us handle it. It is illegal to stop somebody at gunpoint,' he said.</p>

<p>He revealed that many people are going into these areas to fetch some of their belongings before evacuating again.</p>

<p>Several makeshift spray paint signs in Colton and Estacada Oregon have emerged threatening to shoot those who trespass on property.</p>

<p>'Home and armed. You loot, we shoot,' one sign said.</p>

<p>Another said: 'Looters and arsonists will be shot.'</p>

<p>Another said: 'We won’t call your family. Your body will never be found! Bang Bang!'    </p>
