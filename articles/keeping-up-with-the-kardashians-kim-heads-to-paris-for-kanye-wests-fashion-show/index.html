        <p>Kim Kardashian faced the onset of the coronavirus pandemic at Paris Fashion Week on Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.</p>

<p>As her husband Kanye West, 43, prepared for his Yeezy Season 8 show in the City of Lights, Kim, 39, worried that the show might be canceled, or she might get sick.</p>

<p>'Because the virus is so unknown, and you hear it just spreading, we didn't know if the fashion show was gonna happen,' she recalled. 'So our plans kept on changing every day.'</p>

<p>Kim in Paris: Kim Kardashian faced the onset of the coronavirus pandemic at Paris Fashion Week on Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians</p>

<p>Kanye: As her husband Kanye West, 43, prepared for his Yeezy Season 8 show in the City of Lights, Kim, 39, worried that the show might be canceled, or she might get sick</p>

<p>Fittings were delayed and clothes still being shipped, with everything running right up to the last minute, as Khloé Kardashian, 36, and Scott Disick, 37, decided not to attend.</p>

<p>Kim's anxiety got worse after the Yeezy show actually started, because her seven-year-old daughter North West was rapping in front of a crowd for the first time.</p>

<p>'She's never even been up on a stage and practiced,' Kim said. 'So to see her up there, my nerves are just, I honestly start crying because I'm happy for her, but I'm so nervous for her.'</p>

<p>Not going: Fittings were delayed and clothes still being shipped, with everything running right up to the last minute, as Khloé Kardashian, 36, and Scott Disick, 37, decided not to attend</p>

<p>Northie on stage: ‘So you know my name is Northie,’ the girl chanted to cheers at the show. ‘What are those? They are clothes. What are those? These are clothes. Wow!'</p>

<p>Kim: 'She's never even been up on a stage and practiced,' Kim said. 'So to see her up there, my nerves are just, I honestly start crying because I'm happy for her, but I'm so nervous for her'</p>

<p>'So you know my name is Northie,' the girl chanted to cheers at the show. 'What are those? They are clothes. What are those? These are clothes. Wow!'</p>

<p>'Yay! I love you Penelope!' she added, pointing to pal Penelope Disick, eight. 'Yes, I love you. One, two, three!'</p>

<p>Afterward, Kim realized it had all gone better than planned.</p>

<p>On the mic: 'So you know my name is Northie,' the girl chanted to cheers at the show. 'What are those? They are clothes. What are those? These are clothes. Wow!'</p>

<p>Love for Penelope: 'Yay! I love you Penelope!' she added, pointing to pal Penelope Disick, eight. 'Yes, I love you. One, two, three!'</p>

<p>'I'm so proud of how confident she is,' she said of North. 'She obviously gets that from her dad, and it just makes me so happy that she's not afraid to try anything.'</p>

<p>'You know, she's just so fearless, and I love that about her. And I'm such a proud mom.'</p>

<p>At the beginning of the episode, Kim extended an invitation to her family to attend Kanye's Yeezy show in Paris, and everyone seemed excited.</p>

<p>Proud mom: 'I'm so proud of how confident she is,' she said of North. 'She obviously gets that from her dad, and it just makes me so happy that she's not afraid to try anything'</p>

<p>Invite: At the beginning of the episode, Kim extended an invitation to her family to attend Kanye's Yeezy show in Paris, and everyone seemed excited</p>

<p>'Wait, have you guys heard about this new virus?' Kris Jenner, 64, interjected, as Kim said, 'Is it the corona one? Yeah. So, s***, so is it too scary just to be there?'</p>

<p>She reflected on whether she should make the trip. 'It is a little bit scary just thinking about traveling,' she told the cameras, 'because there's talk of the coronavirus circulating, and no one really knows a lot about it. But as of right now Fashion Week is still on, and I talked to so many friends and people that are in Paris and everyone feels super-comfortable, so I'm really excited.'</p>

<p>In the weeks leading up to the show, the news about COVID-19 grew more and more dire, and the family started to text back and forth about it on group chats.</p>

<p>New virus: 'Wait, have you guys heard about this new virus?' Kris Jenner, 64, interjected, as Kim said, 'Is it the corona one? Yeah. So, s***, so is it too scary just to be there?'</p>

<p>'It's all of the links,' Khloé told Scott. 'MJ to Mom: 'They're shutting down Paris.'</p>

<p>She decided not to fly to the Yeezy show because she worried the Paris airport might end up closing, which would separate her from her daughter True, two.</p>

<p>Scott agreed, noting that while Kourtney Kardashian, 41, was taking his daughter Penelope to the show, he didn't want to go and leave his other kids with a nanny.</p>

<p>No fly: She decided not to fly to the Yeezy show because she worried the Paris airport might end up closing, which would separate her from her daughter True, two</p>

<p>Kourtney: Scott agreed, noting that while Kourtney Kardashian, 41, was taking his daughter Penelope to the show, he didn't want to go and leave his other kids with a nanny</p>

<p>Khloé told the cameras, 'Kanye is my family and I will do literally anything to support him but more and more cases are coming out in Europe every single day, and I don't want to potentially get sick. I don't want to risk getting somebody else sick. And there's talks that if travel might be banned, and if we go to Paris, we might be stuck there. And I can't take that risk with my daughter.'</p>

<p>In the next scene, Kim and Kourtney were shown eating at a restaurant in Paris with their daughters, looking at photos of how big North had gotten since their last trip.</p>

<p>'I feel like we need hand sanitizer before we eat,' Kourtney noted.</p>

<p>Support: Khloé told the cameras, 'Kanye is my family and I will do literally anything to support him but more and more cases are coming out in Europe every single day, and I don't want to potentially get sick.

<p>In Paris: In the next scene, Kim and Kourtney were shown eating at a restaurant in Paris with their daughters, looking at photos of how big North had gotten since their last trip</p>

<p>Hand sanitizer: 'I feel like we need hand sanitizer before we eat,' Kourtney noted</p>

<p>That night, North and Penelope ate churros, rode a carousel and danced in their rooms.</p>

<p>The next day, their moms went to church in latex looks sent over by Olivier Rousteing at Balmain, with Kim calling hers 'the coronavirus suit—no one can get in here!'</p>

<p>She'd wanted to wear the tight-fitting look to the Balenciaga show, but went to attend Kanye's gospel-infused Sunday Service at the Bouffes du Nord theater beforehand.</p>

<p>Gospel: She'd wanted to wear the tight-fitting look to the Balenciaga show, but went to attend Kanye's gospel-infused Sunday Service at the Bouffes du Nord theater beforehand</p>

<p>Afterward, she dined with Kourtney, Kanye and pal Fajer Fahad, and admitted that her plans to go to Paris had fluctuated all week as the news got worse.</p>

<p>'I almost walked off the plane,' Kourtney said, as headlines about 'designer masks' and cancellations at Fashion Week were shown.</p>

<p>Fajer said there was good buzz around the Yeezy show, with everyone trying to get invites.</p>

<p>Dined: Afterward, she dined with Kourtney, Kanye and pal Fajer Fahad, and admitted that her plans to go to Paris had fluctuated all week as the news got worse</p>

<p>Headlines: 'I almost walked off the plane,' Kourtney said, as headlines about 'designer masks' and cancellations at Fashion Week were shown</p>

<p>That made her recall the first time Kim met Kanye after his second Yeezy show in Paris.</p>

<p>'I didn't know where to go,' Kim said, of arriving in the city alone. 'I was like, 'You guys, I don't know what to do! I want to get him a cake to celebrate. Don't they have a Ralph's here?'</p>

<p>She'd wound up getting a small box of pastries for Kanye, and got 'kidnapped' by Fajer and a friend, who took care of her.</p>

<p>First meeting: That made her recall the first time Kim met Kanye after his second Yeezy show in Paris</p>

<p>Years later, Kim fretted for her husband, as she'd just learned that fittings were being pushed back for his show because of coronavirus, with items still being sewn and shipped over.</p>

<p>The night of the show itself, she, Kourtney and the kids rode to the event together.</p>

<p>'You wanna get some vibes and listen to some North music?' Kim asked her daughter, who shook her head. 'When are you gonna debut it to the world?'</p>

<p>'My daddy knows,' North said. 'I don't know.'</p>

<p>They got to the show at the Espace Niemeyer with only seconds to spare, and watched the models walk down the runway to the sound of cars honking—the show's 'soundtrack.'</p>

<p>All of a sudden North was onstage, singing, 'Oooh oooh,' as Kim taped her with her phone.</p>

<p>Musical North: 'My daddy knows,' North said. 'I don't know.'</p>

<p>In a confessional, she observed, 'I had no idea what the fashion show was going to look like in itself, but when Kanye asked North, 'Do you wanna sing?' I just… the nerves that I have now… '</p>

<p>Afterward, Kim and Kanye told North she'd done well, and Kourtney noted that the performance had been 'cool' to experience during such a tough time.</p>

<p>'You girls, put on hand sanitizer,' she told North and Penelope as they left the show.</p>

<p>No idea: In a confessional, she observed, 'I had no idea what the fashion show was going to look like in itself, but when Kanye asked North, 'Do you wanna sing?' I just… the nerves that I have now… '</p>

<p>On Kim's return home to California, she found herself the target of a long-running prank.</p>

<p>Earlier on the episode, Khloé and Scott admitted to Kris that they had been pranking her for five months with Kim, the KUWTK crew and their assistants.</p>

<p>Khloé had repeatedly posed as Kris while doing embarrassing things—dumpster diving, throwing trash from her car, and publicly vomiting—all of which they had photographed.</p>

<p>Prank victim: On Kim's return home to California, she found herself the target of a long-running prank</p>

<p>Admitted: Earlier on the episode, Khloé and Scott admitted to Kris that they had been pranking her for five months with Kim, the KUWTK crew and their assistants</p>

<p>Admitted: Khloé had repeatedly posed as Kris while doing embarrassing things—dumpster diving, throwing trash from her car, and publicly vomiting—all of which they had photographed</p>

<p>Once they even got Kris so drunk she didn't remember whether or not she'd done the things she'd been accused of doing, then told her the photos were being shopped to tabloids.</p>

<p>'These little b****es got me so f***ing good, thinking that I was losing my mind and I'm a sloppy drunk,' Kris marveled, impressed.</p>

<p>To keep the joke going, Kris called Kim and told her she was 'really upset,' because TMZ had pictures of her 'in a trash dumpster and peeing on the street.'</p>

<p>Little b****es: 'These little b****es got me so f***ing good, thinking that I was losing my mind and I'm a sloppy drunk,' Kris marveled, impressed.</p>

<p>Upset: To keep the joke going, Kris called Kim and told her she was 'really upset,' because TMZ had pictures of her 'in a trash dumpster and peeing on the street'</p>

<p>'I must have blacked out after I had dinner,' she said as Kim laughed. 'It's not funny Kim. This could ruin my entire career.'</p>

<p>To 'torture' Kim, she passed on alcohol during a meal, and called to tell her that she was going to rehab for alcohol issues after learning she 'blacked out and climbed into a trash bin.'</p>

<p>Horrified, Kim texted Khloé from Paris, 'I'm freaking out! You guys mom called me and told me she's checking herself into rehab!'</p>

<p>Ruin: 'I must have blacked out after I had dinner,' she said as Kim laughed. 'It's not funny Kim. This could ruin my entire career'</p>

<p>Freaking out: Horrified, Kim texted Khloé from Paris, 'I'm freaking out! You guys mom called me and told me she's checking herself into rehab!'</p>

<p>She squirmed, telling the cameras, 'I don't even know how I got roped into this!'</p>

<p>When Kim got back home, Kris upped the ante: She called and said she was in Palm Springs, California, about to check into a rehab clinic.</p>

<p>'They said they had to take my phone,' Kris claimed, acting up a storm. 'I said, 'Oh my God,' so you're the only one I'm calling. I just want to tell you, I think it's the best thing to do for me, for my soul. I think I've got a problem, and I've got to deal with it, and…'</p>

<p>Roped: She squirmed, telling the cameras, 'I don't even know how I got roped into this!'</p>

<p>Acting: 'They said they had to take my phone,' Kris claimed, acting up a storm. 'I said, 'Oh my God,' so you're the only one I'm calling. I just want to tell you, I think it's the best thing to do for me, for my soul. I think I've got a problem, and I've got to deal with it, and…'</p>

<p>Kim turned to Scott, who was sitting next to her, and asked, 'I have to tell her, right?'</p>

<p>'Kim, I blacked out,' Kris went on. 'I don't remember being in a garbage can.'</p>

<p>Kim broke, saying, 'Wait, mom, I have to talk to you. This has all been a prank. You did not black out. That was all Khloé in those pictures dressed up as you. This has been an ongoing prank for months.'</p>

<p>Prank: Kim broke, saying, 'Wait, mom, I have to talk to you. This has all been a prank. You did not black out. That was all Khloé in those pictures dressed up as you. This has been an ongoing prank for months'</p>

<p>Kris fake-exploded. 'Are you f<strong><em>ing out of your mind?' she roared. 'Are you f</em></strong>ing crazy, Kim? Are you crazy? This is a f***ing prank, and I'm at the Betty Ford Center?'</p>

<p>'Mom, I feel awful,' Kim said, blaming it on Khloé and Scott. 'I'll send you all the photos.'</p>

<p>'But you did this,' Scott whispered, as Kim insisted, 'This wasn't my idea.'</p>

<p>Scott insists: 'But you did this,' Scott whispered, as Kim insisted, 'This wasn't my idea'</p>

<p>Kris hung up on Kim, shouting, 'I don't even know what I'm going to say to you, Kim. I'm so f***ing p****ed.'</p>

<p>Kim texted everyone involved in the prank, saying, 'You guys, mom is gonna kill us all,' and reminded them she wasn't going to take the fall for it.</p>

<p>Just then, Kris opened a door in the room, calling, 'Helloooooo! Just got back from rehab! It was great! I feel so much better!'</p>

<p>Rehab: Just then, Kris opened a door in the room, calling, 'Helloooooo! Just got back from rehab! It was great! I feel so much better!'</p>

<p>Kim laughed, and told her mom, 'I hate you!' while asking Scott if he'd known of her plans.</p>

<p>'I am in such shock,' she said in a confessional. 'I totally fell for it. I had no idea she was in on it… I can't believe that I was the one that got pranked in the end.'</p>

<p>Kris told her daughter that 'if we all got quarantined, we would have a lot of fun. 'Cause we would just play pranks on each other.'</p>

<p>Hate you: Kim laughed, and told her mom, 'I hate you!' while asking Scott if he'd known of her plans</p>

<p>Quarantine: Kris told her daughter that 'if we all got quarantined, we would have a lot of fun. 'Cause we would just play pranks on each other.'</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the show, Kris and her boyfriend Corey Gamble, 39, adopted a rescue poodle named Bridget, but the momager was too busy to take care of her.</p>

<p>'Kris is the one that wanted a dog, but I'm doing 99.7% of all dog duties,' Corey carped.</p>

<p>To get Kris' attention, he spoiled Bridget, taking her to lunch, suggesting she visit Palm Springs and a Lakers game with him, and pretending to have a Patek Philippe watch made for her.</p>

<p>Spoiled: To get Kris' attention, he spoiled Bridget, taking her to lunch, suggesting she visit Palm Springs and a Lakers game with him, and pretending to have a Patek Philippe watch made for her.</p>

<p>'Looks like I have some competition,' Kris said, as Corey shot back, 'Competition? No one comes before Bridget. There's Bridget, then the world. She's number one, and you're… Kris.'</p>

<p>Her pal Faye Resnick told her not to be jealous, saying 'Bridget's cute, but you're Kris Jenner.'</p>

<p>To win Corey's affection, Kris dressed up in a dalmatian costume, which her boyfriend loved.</p>

<p>She promised to be a better dog mom, offering, 'You should see what I have on under this.'</p>

<p>The couple went into a bedroom and shut the door, vowing to be back in '20 to 25' minutes.</p>

<p>In a sneak peek of next week's episode, Scott wondered if he had the symptoms of COVID-19, saying, 'I don't feel like what a normal 36-year-old feels like.'</p>
