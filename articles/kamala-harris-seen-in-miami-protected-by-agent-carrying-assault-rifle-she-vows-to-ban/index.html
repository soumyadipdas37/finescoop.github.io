        <p>Kamala Harris was seen leaving an appearance in Miami where she was guarded by a Secret Service officer armed with an assault weapon - the same type of gun she vowed to ban.</p>

<p>In the photos exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com, the VP hopeful is seen leaving Florida Memorial University on Thursday, ironically being protected by the same assault rifle that she promised to ban within the first 100 days of her term.</p>

<p>It's worth noting, however, that Secret Service agents are trained and equipped to handle such a weapon. </p>

<p>Harris made the comments during her run for president last year in a CNN town hall, where she said she would take 'executive action' if Congress didn't pass reasonable gun safety laws, which included enhanced background checks. </p>

<p>There was also a heavy police presence guarding the venue where Harris spoke, with at least two dozen officers protecting the Democrat who supports defunding the police. </p>

<p>VP candidate Kamala Harris visited Florida Memorial University on Thursday in Miami and was protected by an assault rifle-wielding guard</p>

<p>She met with the local leaders at the historically Black university in Miami Gardens while wearing a tan pant-suit and black mask </p>

<p>In the photos exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com, the VP hopeful is seen being protected by the same assault weapon that she promised to ban within the first 100 days of her term</p>

<p>Harris has previously said that if Congress failed to enact reasonable gun safety laws she would take 'executive action' to do so</p>

<p>Also seen with Harris was her husband Doug Emhoff who emerged behind her wearing a white mask and being led by security</p>

<p>There was a heavy police presence guarding the venue where Harris spoke, with some officers coming from as far as Homestead, which is about 30miles from Miami</p>

<p>Also seen with Harris was her husband Doug Emhoff who emerged behind her wearing a white mask and being escorted by security. </p>

<p>Harris made the vow in April 2019 during a CNN town hall, where she said, 'Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the Courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws. And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.'   </p>

<p>At the time, Harris said that if people 'want to go hunting, that's fine' but said she would advocate for new gun safety laws including requiring universal background checks. </p>

<p>'There are people in Washington, D.C., supposed leaders, who have failed to have the courage to reject a false choice which suggests you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away,' she said.</p>

<p>At the event last week, there were about two dozen officers, with some officers coming from as far as Homestead, which is about 30miles from Miami. </p>

<p>When the officers were asked how they felt about the Democrat party's intentions to defund the police, they said they want more funding and more training as well. </p>

<p>Many of the officers were seen standing near their motorcycles with their handguns holstered, while a member secret service was seen with the rifle strapped across his body. </p>

<p>Harris has supported defunding the police, saying in June, 'For far too long the status quo thinking has been to believe that by putting more police on the street you're going to have more safety. And that's just wrong, that's not how it works.'</p>

<p>Harris said the way to create 'healthy communities' was by investing in core community needs such as educational opportunities, jobs, home ownership and affordable housing.</p>

<p>Harris was meeting with members of the Black community Thursday to speak about race relations in South Florida and discussed the current presidential campaign</p>

<p>Harris and husband Doug Emhoff were seen being escorted by a secret service Thursday as the VP candidate made her first stop in the battleground state of Florida </p>

<p>Harris said in 2019 that if people 'want to go hunting, that's fine' but said she would advocate for new gun safety laws including requiring universal background checks</p>

<p>Many of the officers were seen standing near their motorcycles with their handguns holstered, while a member secret service was seen with the rifle strapped across his body</p>

<p>When the officers were asked how they felt about the Democrat party's intentions to defund the police, they said they want more funding and more training as well</p>

<p>Harris was meeting with members of the Black community Thursday to speak about race relations in South Florida and discussed the current presidential campaign.  </p>

<p>She met with the local leaders at the historically Black university in Miami Gardens while wearing a tan pant-suit and black mask.  </p>

<p>'You truly are the future of our country,' she said into a microphone outside of the university. 'You are the ones who are going to inspire us and fight for the ideals of our country.'</p>

<p>'My feet hit the ground almost minutes after Joe asked me to join him on the ticket because there's just so much at stake in this election,' she added. </p>

<p>This was the VP candidate's first visit to the battleground state while on the campaign trail and she was greeted by a marching band before the hour-long discussion with local Black leaders.  </p>

<p>She spoke very little of gun control and instead focused on race relations and the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>'You truly are the future of our country,' she said into a microphone outside of the university. 'You are the ones who are going to inspire us and fight for the ideals of our country'</p>

<p>She met with the local leaders at the historically Black university in Miami Gardens while wearing a tan pant-suit and black mask</p>

<p>This was the VP candidate's first visit to the battleground state while on the campaign trail and she was greeted by a marching band before the hour-long discussion with local Black leaders</p>

<p>'Talking about a virus that has impacted over six million people directly, those who have contracted it and, frankly, a dereliction of duty,' Harris said.</p>

<p>'The president of the United States has as one of their most important duties to concern themselves with protecting the safety, the well-being of the American people. I think that it is very clear from the most recent comments, plus from his actions for months now, that the president has acted with a reckless disregard of human life.'     </p>

<p>Harris added that a Biden administration would offer a different approach to the pandemic.</p>

<p>'Joe and I feel very strongly about the need to address these issues by speaking truth about the science and then having a national plan that is about testing, it's about treatment and when, God willing, we get a vaccine, about distribution of a vaccine,' Harris said. 'The health and well-being of our nation is at stake.'   </p>
