        <p>Daniele 'Dani' Donato made enemies of her fellow houseguests as she toyed with everyone's emotions on Tuesday's episode of Big Brother All-Stars.</p>

<p>As Head of Household, the 34-year-old stay-at-home mom was forced to make a series of decisions during the show that turned nearly everyone against her.</p>

<p>Her own alliance members in The Committee even had her in their sights, with Christmas Abbott, 35, sniping, 'Let's face it, [Dani's] kind of the shadiest of the group.'</p>

<p>Rough reign: Daniele 'Dani' Donato made enemies of her fellow houseguests as she toyed with everyone's emotions on Tuesday's episode of Big Brother All-Stars</p>

<p>All of Dani's plans went awry because of BB's newest tool that became available during a recent basement competition.</p>

<p>The Disruptor power gave the person who held it the ability to remove someone from the eviction chopping block.</p>

<p>Dani already had put David Alexander, 30, and Kevin Campbell, 40, up for eviction, figuring they were innocuous enough targets and wouldn't ruffle any feathers.</p>

<p>She had no idea that David had won the Disruptor power during the show competition, which gave him the ability to keep either himself or someone else safe for the rest of the week.</p>

<p>Eviction nominations: As Head of Household, the 34-year-old stay-at-home mom was forced to make a series of decisions during the show that turned nearly everyone against her</p>

<p>David, a newbie who was often accused of being an inexperienced player, seized this rare chance to try to demonstrate his skills.</p>

<p>He drummed up some fake tears to prepare for the announcement that he was saved.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the house, Cody Calafiore, 29, and Enzo Palumbo, 42, wondered if Dani was planning to backdoor her frenemy Tyler Crispen, 23.</p>

<p>Disruptor power: David Alexander was nominated for eviction, but was holding the Disruptor power</p>

<p>If she did that, it would destroy two alliances in the house, including The Committee.</p>

<p>'That's the key to this week,' Cody told Enzo. 'Noms have to stay the same.'</p>

<p>Moments later, the houseguests were called to the meeting room, where they heard that someone was about to use the Disruptor power.</p>

<p>Status quo: Cody Calafiore and Enzo Palumbo wanted the nominations to stay the same</p>

<p>'Oh my God, what am I going to do?' Dani cried, realizing she'd have to replace one of the men who was up for eviction.</p>

<p>It was quickly revealed that David was being saved from the block, and he acted his heart out.</p>

<p>'I thought people wanted me gone,' he fake-sobbed, as his castmates rubbed his shoulders and told him to 'Be happy!'</p>

<p>Acting attempt: 'I thought people wanted me gone,' David fake-sobbed, as his castmates rubbed his shoulders and told him to 'Be happy!'</p>

<p>Dani, thrown for a loop, said she'd put Tyler on the block in David's place.</p>

<p>'This couldn't be more uncomfortable for me,' she admitted in a confessional. 'Everyone is looking me in the eye absolutely horrified.'</p>

<p>Dani tried to patch things up with Tyler, telling him she was sure he could win the golden power of the veto and take himself back off the block.</p>

<p>Controversial decision: 'This couldn't be more uncomfortable for me,' Dani admitted in a confessional after putting Tyler Crispen up to replace David. 'Everyone is looking me in the eye absolutely horrified'</p>

<p>Tyler looked at the HoH with a cynical eye.</p>

<p>'I see where I stand with Dani,' he observed.</p>

<p>David was still playing up his good fortune, walking around the house and dramatically asking everyone if they had saved him.</p>

<p>Duly noted: 'I see where I stand with Dani,' Tyler observed</p>

<p>'Ain't nobody in here trying to save you right now,' Da'Vonne Rogers, 32, said privately, amused. 'I was about to give [David] the Oscar, but this whole telenovela he's doing right now, I don't know what the endgame is.'</p>

<p>Dani wondered what she would do if Tyler really did win the veto power.</p>

<p>She asked Christmas if she could put her up on the block in his place, as a 'pawn' who would merely serve as a figurehead to get Kevin voted off.</p>

<p>Still going: David was still playing up his good fortune, walking around the house and dramatically asking everyone if they had saved him</p>

<p>Telenovela act: 'Ain't nobody in here trying to save you right now,' Da'Vonne Rogers, 32, said privately, amused. 'I was about to give [David] the Oscar, but this whole telenovela he's doing right now, I don't know what the endgame is'</p>

<p>Christmas was stunned, as she and Dani were both in The Committee.</p>

<p>'Dani, baby girl, what is going on?' she said to the cameras. 'You put up an alliance member… if he wins the veto and takes himself off, you want to put up another alliance member? There are people in this house that are not in The Committee!'</p>

<p>The week's veto competition soon arrived, and Dani, Tyler and Kevin were joined by three houseguests whose names they'd drawn: Da'Vonne, Enzo and Ian Terry, 29.</p>

<p>Alliance member: 'Dani, baby girl, what is going on?' Christmas Abbott said to the cameras. 'You put up an alliance member… if he wins the veto and takes himself off, you want to put up another alliance member? There are people in this house that are not in The Committee!'</p>

<p>The six of them were sent via a giant 'teleportation machine' to individual sets, where they each had to stack 15 'microbeers' into pyramids using giant tweezers.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne was thrilled to win the power of veto, but she found herself in a pickle.</p>

<p>She'd already told Dani that if she won, she would not take anyone new off the block.</p>

<p>Veto competition: The week's veto competition soon arrived, and Dani, Tyler and Kevin were joined by three houseguests whose names they'd drawn: Da'Vonne, Enzo and Ian Terry, 29, who were all dispatched away magically by Nicole Franzel</p>

<p>Micro beers: The six of them were sent via a giant 'teleportation machine' to individual sets, where they each had to stack 15 'microbeers' into pyramids using giant tweezers</p>

<p>The winner: Da'Vonne completed the delicate task first and won the power of veto</p>

<p>In truth, she hadn't really thought she would win, and wanted to save her pal Kevin.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne told Dani, who went into panic mode, immediately deciding that if Kevin was pulled, she'd put Ian up instead.</p>

<p>Ian was unattached to anyone else in the house, and as a former BB winner was a perfect target for elimination, but Dani was reluctant to send him home.</p>

<p>Panic mode: Dani went into panic mode after learning of Da'Vonne's plans</p>

<p>She complained to Nicole Franzel, 28, saying, 'I literally have nobody. Every other person that's not in an alliance with us is safe.'</p>

<p>Nicole acted like she was fine with that idea, but inside she was seething.</p>

<p>'I'm pretty furious,' she said. 'Ian and I are super-close in this house, and we have a final two. If he goes home, I'll be the only winner left in this house and my target will get way bigger. So I'm not okay at all with this idea.'</p>

<p>Pretty furious: 'I'm pretty furious,' Nicole said. 'Ian and I are super-close in this house, and we have a final two. If he goes home, I'll be the only winner left in this house and my target will get way bigger. So I'm not okay at all with this idea'</p>

<p>Cody suggested that Dani try to talk Da'Vonne out of using her veto power on Kevin.</p>

<p>She attempted it, telling Da'Vonne that saving him would be bad for her game.</p>

<p>That was the wrong move to make with her fiercely loyal castmate.</p>

<p>'I don't know why Dani has such a big problem with me trying to save Kevin,' Da'Vonne said in a confessional. 'It kind of makes me feel like she and I are only cool if I'm doing something that works for her game.</p>

<p>Astute observation: 'I don't know why Dani has such a big problem with me trying to save Kevin,' Da'Vonne said in a confessional. 'It kind of makes me feel like she and I are only cool if I'm doing something that works for her game'</p>

<p>'This is my veto,' the acting coach emphasized. 'I won that. So if I choose to do something like save Kevin, understand that. Respect it.'</p>

<p>To Dani, she cautioned, 'I hope this week doesn't ruin whatever we're building.'</p>

<p>'Me too,' Dani returned, looking tense.</p>

<p>At the veto meeting, Da'Vonne told her castmates that the week had 'sucked,' as it was the first time she'd ever won the veto, and she had 'no commitments' to either Kevin or Tyler.</p>

<p>Veto meeting: At the veto meeting, Da'Vonne told her castmates that the week had 'sucked,' as it was the first time she'd ever won the veto, and she had 'no commitments' to either Kevin Campbell or Tyler</p>

<p>'You are not my ally,' she told Kevin, smiling. 'But you are my friend. I have decided. Kevin, I'm going to use the veto on you.'</p>

<p>Dani looked incredibly put-out, and tried to salvage what was left of her game.</p>

<p>'Everyone knows Tyler and I had an issue,' she announced to the group. 'I will be campaigning for him to go home this week. So I need the ultimate pawn.'</p>

<p>Big hug: Kevin hugged Da'Vonne after she removed him from the eviction chopping block</p>

<p>Tears rolled down Nicole's face as Dani named Ian to the block.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne enjoyed watching Dani squirm, saying privately she'd just gotten her 'first taste of power' in the house, and liked it.</p>

<p>'Hold onto your wigs, ladies,' she warned. 'This won't be the last time.'</p>

<p>Getting emotional: Tears rolled down Nicole's face as Dani named Ian to the block</p>

<p>In a confessional, Dani revealed that she was still backing Tyler as a member of The Committee, but wanted to mislead Ian.</p>

<p>Her plan appeared to backfire, however, as Tyler, Nicole and Ian now put Dani in their sights.</p>

<p>'I can forgive, Dani, but I can't forget,' Tyler said, as Nicole agonized over Ian's potential eviction.</p>

<p>Long memory: 'I can forgive, Dani, but I can't forget,' Tyler said, as Nicole agonized over Ian's potential eviction</p>

<p>In the Diary Room, Ian kicked something over, furious.</p>

<p>'I'm just enraged,' he said. 'How f***ing stupid can she be?'</p>

<p>Big Brother All-Stars will return Wednesday on CBS.</p>

<p>Really mad: 'I'm just enraged,' Ian said after Dani nominated him for eviction. 'How f***ing stupid can she be?'</p>
