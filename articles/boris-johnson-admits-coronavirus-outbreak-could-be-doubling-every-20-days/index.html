    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Coronavirus cases in the UK could be taking as long as 20 days to double in number, Boris Johnson admitted today as he rowed back from claims made by his top scientist only yesterday.</p>

<p>Sir Patrick Vallance said the doubling time was one week and made the terrifying prediction that the UK could be on course to hit 50,000 cases per day by mid-October.</p>

<p>Experts today lashed out at the claim, saying there was no scientific basis for the extraordinary number of infections the chief scientific adviser had warned about. The stark prediction saw the chief scientific adviser and his colleague, chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty, dubbed Professor Gloom and Dr Doom.</p>

<p>But Mr Johnson today appeared to distance himself from the pair told MPs the figure was – ambiguously – somewhere between one and three weeks. At the peak of the epidemic the doubling time of cases was just three days.</p>

<p>Officially diagnosed cases now suggest the outbreak is taking two weeks to double, rising from a daily average of 1,022 on August 22 to 2,032 on September to 3,929 yesterday.</p>

<p>One expert, Professor David Paton, said data had been presented unfairly to the public and demanded: 'If they’ve got an explanation [for why the data was presented like that], then let’s hear it'.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister made the comments in a speech to MPs in the House of Commons today when he warned 'this is the moment when we must act'. </p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson today announced a tightening of lockdown rules, including a requirement for pubs and restaurants to shut at 10pm, which he said could last for another six months</p>

<p>Mr Johnson said in Parliament: 'I’m sorry to say that as in Spain, France and many other countries we have reached a perilous turning point. </p>

<p>'A month ago, on average, around a thousand people across the UK were testing positive for coronavirus every day. The latest figure has almost quadrupled to 3,929. </p>

<p>'Yesterday the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser warned that the doubling rate for new cases could be between seven and 20 days with the possibility of tens of thousands of new infections next month.'</p>

<p>The 3,929 figure the PM referred to is the average number of coronavirus cases diagnosed each day in the week leading up to yesterday, September 21.</p>

<p>That has almost doubled from 2,032 on August 22, suggesting a doubling time of two weeks. </p>

<p>However, testing is still only expected to be diagnosing around half of the true number of Covid-19 cases. The Office for National Statistics estimates that 6,000 people per day are catching the virus in England and Wales.</p>

<p>The most recent published estimates of the epidemic doubling time – a measure of how fast cases are growing – put it at between seven and 17 days.</p>

<p>The REACT mass testing study, carried out by Imperial College London in conjunction with the Government, predicted on September 11 that it could be as fast as one week (7.7 days) based on test results from between August 22 and September 7.</p>

<p>Using longer term data from tests dating back to July 24, a more conservative estimate was made of a doubling time of 17 days – two-and-a-half weeks. </p>

<p>Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Chris Whitty, holding a one-off televised briefing together yesterday, warned the public about the worst case scenario.</p>

<p>The chief scientific adviser said: 'If that [rise in cases] continues unabated and this grows, doubling every seven days, then what you see, of course, let's say there were 5,000 today, it would be 10,000 next week, 20,000 the week after, 40,000 the week after, and you can see that by mid-October, if that continued, you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October, per day.'</p>

<p>The number of people officially testing positive – now thought to be approximately half the number of true infections – has doubled once a fortnight over the past month</p>

<p>Sir Patrick stressed yesterday that his sobering scenario of 500,000 cases a day was based on a lot of unknowns. And he said it was 'not a prediction'</p>

<p>Experts threw cold water on the dramatic graph presented by Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty, saying it was 'implausible' that case numbers would outstrip France and Spain by so much</p>

<p>The doomsday prediction was met by outrage in the scientific community, with critics accusing the advisers of 'scaring people' and touting 'implausible' numbers.</p>

<p>Professor David Paton, an industrial economist at the University of Nottingham, said he was 'shocked' at the way the chief scientists presented infections data.</p>

<p>Reeling against yesterday's presentation he said in a blog today: 'Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance are eminent scientists and it is inconceivable that they did not know what they were doing in the briefing. </p>

<p>'On one level, they have accomplished their aim: the media is dutifully reporting the frightening "50,000 cases by 13th October" figure and the groundwork has been prepared for the PM's speech telling us what new restrictions he will be imposing on the country.</p>

<p>'However, the price of politicising statistics is that you risk undermining public trust in government science.</p>

<p>'If that is the long term effect of yesterday’s briefing, I wonder if Professor Whitty and Sir Patrick will continue to think it was a price worth paying.'</p>

<p>Professor Paton pointed out that top officials and politicians have warned that the UK is likely following what is happening in France and Spain.</p>

<p>Those nations have recorded a significant rise in daily infections in recent weeks, and hospitalisations and deaths have gone up alongside them.</p>

<p>But they are nowhere near 50,000 per day – with an average 11,105 cases per day in Spain and 10,116 in France.</p>

<p>'Of course, no-one knows with absolute certainty what will happen to cases in the UK over the next few weeks,' Professor Paton added.</p>

<p>'Indicating the likely number of cases if the UK followed Spain or France would not have been an unreasonable approach for Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance to take. </p>

<p>'So why didn’t they? The obvious suspicion is that 7,000-10,000 cases per day by mid-October might just not have been scary enough for people to accept imminent new restrictions on their way of life.'</p>

<p>Professor Paul Hunter, a a medical expert at the University of East Anglia, said: 'What they presented is the very worst possible case, given the state of the epidemic at the moment.</p>

<p>'I think it is pretty implausible we will be seeing 50,000 cases a day by the middle of October. </p>

<p>'It’s important to bear in mind that they were not making a prediction, they were presenting an illustration of what would happen if cases continued to double, which they almost certainly will not.'</p>

<p>Professor Chris Whitty (right, with Sir Patrick Vallance on the left) appealed to the public’s selflessness in adhering to the rules and not just assuming they could 'take their own risks'</p>

<p>The University of Buckingham's Professor Karol Sikora, who has regularly been critical of the Government's coronavirus response, said: 'They’re so negative. The graph for the worst case scenario, for 50,000 cases a day by next month, it’s just scaring people.'</p>

<p>And Steve Brown, a self-employed consultant with 20 years of statistical experience, told MailOnline: 'We know that SAGE is deliberately using personal fear to drive behaviour, that is documented in the minutes and is their policy. </p>

<p>'Although the graph presented by the Government advisors may not have been intended as a prediction, many people will understandably see it as such.' </p>

<p>Piers Morgan, raging about the prediction on Good Morning Britain today, said: 'If you want the headlines to be 50,000, that’s the figure you use, that’s what they did. </p>

<p>'But they haven’t explained, actually, what they're basing it on given that in every other country nobody is projected to be anywhere near that by the middle of October. </p>

<p>'And that’s the problem. That the people who are sceptical about this, and don't want any action, are saying "why have you reached that figure?" And that’s what Boris Johnson has to answer – is to tell the British public why have we arrived at 50,000?'</p>
