        <p>History will be made next Wednesday night when Elly and Becky Miles become Australia's first duel Bachelorettes.   </p>

<p>And speculation is rife about the identities of the men who will compete to win the sisters' hearts. </p>

<p>While Channel 10 is yet to release an offical line-up, Bachelorette fans and super-sleuths from the Bach and Bachette forum, are convinced they've tracked most of this year's cast already.  </p>

<p>Meet The Bachelorette suitors! From football stars to male models and a Home And Away actor - meet the men vying for Elly and Becky Miles' hearts. Pictured: Elly Miles, 25, Becky Miles, 30 </p>

<p>University graduate Adam is based in Melbourne.</p>

<p>While little is known about the man bun-wearing stud, his LinkedIn page suggests he has an interest in science and sport. </p>

<p>He attended Trinity College at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 2016, and completed a Bachelor degree of Science specialising in Geology and Earth Science. </p>

<p>James 'Harry' Harris, South Australia</p>

<p>Reality TV buffs may recognise James, 34, from his appearance on House Rules with then-wife Kate Whiting in 2017.   </p>

<p>In 2018, builder James shocked fans by announcing that he and Kate had split after nine years together. </p>

<p>The couple also sold the house they'd renovated together on the show, but insisted they would remain 'great friends' for the sake of their son Xavier, five. </p>

<p>Remember me? Reality TV buffs may recognise James 'Harry' Harris, 34, (pictured) from his appearance on House Rules in 2017</p>

<p>Splitsville: In 2018, builder James shocked fans by announcing that he and wife Kate Whiting (right) had split after nine years together </p>

<p>'We've been working on our relationship for a while – it's not something we gave up on,' Kate told Adelaide Now at the time.  </p>

<p>'We just drifted apart. That happens sometimes I think, especially when you get together at such a young age.</p>

<p>James, who introduced himself as 'Harry' in a teaser for The Bachelorette, currently owns his own Adelaide-based construction company. </p>

<p>Moving on: The couple also sold the house they'd renovated together on the show, but insisted they would remain 'great friends' for the sake of their son Xavier, five (centre) </p>

<p>Shannon Karaka - New South Wales  </p>

<p>Acting, dancing and modelling - Shannon is truly a triple threat. </p>

<p>In 2017, the Sydney-based beefcake was named the winner of Australia's Mr Polynesia pageant, beating nine contenders for the top spot. </p>

<p>Whole package! Acting, dancing and modelling - Shannon Karaka (pictured) is truly a triple threat.</p>

<p>At the time, he told TeoMaoriNews that he hoped to use his new fame to spread awareness about mental health issues in men. </p>

<p>He also told the publication he dreamed of being scouted by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson for a role in one of his movies. </p>

<p>Shannon is no stranger to the small-screen, having played a member of the River Boys on Home And Away in 2017.  </p>

<p>Impressive: In 2017, the Sydney-based beefcake was named the winner of Australia's Mr Polynesia pageant, beating nine contenders for the top spot</p>

<p>The camera loves him! He has also dabbled in some extra work, appearing as an All Blacks body double in an AIG television commercial in 2018, and a furniture designer in an NBN television commercial in 2017</p>

<p>Pascal Wallace - New South Wales </p>

<p>Sydney-based heartthrob Pascal is a physiotherapist specialising in sports injuries. </p>

<p>Based in Bondi, the hunk describes himself as a 'world explorer' who values 'kindness and laughter'. </p>

<p>Clearly talented in his field, Pascal currently manages several physiotherapy clinics across Sydney. </p>

<p>Brawn and brains! Sydney-based heartthrob Pascal is a physiotherapist who also enjoys playing dodgeball</p>

<p>Easygoing: Based in Bondi, the hunk describes himself as a 'world explorer' who values 'kindness and laughter'</p>

<p>He is also a keen dodgeball player, having doubled as a player and team physiotherapist for Australia in the Dodgeball World Championships in 2012.  </p>

<p>'I am humbled to have the honour of representing this proud nation, firstly as a player and secondly as a physio,' he told Fairfield City Champion at the time,   </p>

<p>'I've represented NSW at school level in cricket, water polo, swimming and rugby - but this is the pinnacle.'   </p>

<p>Frazer Neate, Queensland</p>

<p>Frazer is a football player from Mount Gravatt, Queensland.</p>

<p>The fair-haired hunk is no stranger to winning awards, having received Queensland State League's .J.A. Grogan Medal for the 'best and fairest player' in September last year.  </p>

<p>Sportsman: Frazer Neate (pictured) is a football player from Mount Gravatt, Queensland </p>

<p>Upon winning the medal, Frazer was described by the QAFL website as being his usual humble self.   </p>

<p>'I didn't think I would win. I honestly didn't expect this to happen so I'm really proud of myself and the Mt Gravatt boys,' he said at the time.  </p>

<p>While Frazer has scarce online presence and has locked down his social media, an old MySpace account, which appears to have been last updated when the athlete was in high school, lists troubled AFL star Ben Cousins as one of his heroes. </p>

<p>Ball boy: Frazer boasts an award-winning career in the QAFL (Queensland Australian Football League) </p>

<p>Joe Woodbury, New South Wales</p>

<p>Newcastle-based rugby player Joe Woodbury, 25, is a tattooed football player with a penchant for sharing photos of himself shirtless online.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it appears he and Elly had already crossed paths before filming the reality dating show, as Elly already followed Joe on Instagram prior to filming starting.</p>

<p>The talented winger has previously made headlines thanks to his impressive football skills. </p>

<p>Front runner: Joe Woodbury, 25, (pictured) from Newcastle is one of the many men who will be vying for Elly's heart</p>
