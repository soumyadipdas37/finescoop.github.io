        <p>Only three hat-tricks have ever been scored against teams managed by Pep Guardiola – and Jamie Vardy now has two of them.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi scored the other and, had the summer and the season panned out differently, this match would have been his home debut for Manchester City, before a besotted and raucous full house. Instead, an echoing Etihad played host to a club legend of a wholly different variety – Vardy, whose career has been spent on a trajectory that could not be more different to one lived in the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>What a player he is, though – and what a knotty little problem for Manchester City, always running, always twisting, always turning, fast and quick-witted and seemingly impossible to contain.</p>

<p>Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick comprised of an excellent flick and two penalties for Leicester against Manchester City</p>

<p>Vardy celebrates with his Leicester team-mates after scoring his side's second goal in the clash against Manchester City</p>

<p>James Maddison, who was brought on as a substitute, is delighted after his excellent goal made it 4-1 to Leicester</p>

<p>Youri Tielemans put the icing on the cake for Leicester in the 88th minute to make it 5-2 from the penalty spot on Sunday</p>

<p>Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Garcia, Ake, Mendy, Fernandinho (Delap 51), Rodri, Foden (Torres 64), De Bruyne, Sterling, Mahrez</p>

<p>Subs: Steffen, Zinchenko, Laporte, Doyle, Palmer</p>

<p>Goals: Mahrez 4, Ake 84</p>

<p>Booked: Ake </p>

<p>Leicester: Schmeichel, Castagne, Evans (Fuchs 80), Soyuncu, Justin, Mendy, Amartey, Tielemans, Praet (Maddison 68), Barnes, Vardy (Iheanacho 85)</p>

<p>Subs: Ward, Albrighton, Perez, Choudhury</p>

<p>Goals: Vardy 37 (pen), 54, 58 (pen), Maddison 77, Tielemans 87 (pen)</p>

<p>Booked: Tielemans, Soyuncu, Amartey</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He won two penalties, scored two penalties and, in between, converted from close range after a lovely near post darting run. City barely looked like getting in it after Leicester's second, but all hope evaporated after James Maddison scored the fourth with 13 minutes remaining, arguably the goal of the game. The fifth, another penalty, merely confirmed what we already knew: defensively, City remain a look way from being title contenders.</p>

<p>And while it can be argued City are missing players, and were forced to play Raheem Sterling as the spearhead of the front-line, an absence of forwards is not the reason a team leaks five goals. More worryingly, had Wolves taken their chances something very similar could have happened last Monday, too.</p>

<p>After Vardy's first penalty had pulled Leicester level at half-time, a City onslaught was expected, a second 45 minutes of attack versus defence, Leicester crowding behind the ball, eyes on a point. Instead: the opposite. The arrival of teenage striker Liam Delap after 51 minutes was a sign Guardiola was not happy with the threat his team was posing – and the young man did hit the bar with a header – but more troubling was the inability to spot Leicester's clever movement and nullify it.</p>

<p>After 53 minutes, Yiouri Tielemans – a contender for man of the match, despite Vardy's heroics – played a sweet ball through to Timothy Castagne on the right. It split Benjamin Mendy and Nathan Ake, neither of whom seemed greatly alive to it, and by then it was too late. Castagne crossed and Vardy nipped in at the near post to flick the ball past Ederson for his second.</p>

<p>Just four minutes later, Leicester had a third. The excellent Harvey Barnes fed Vardy, he went looking for a foul from Eric Garcia, and the defender obligingly delivered it. Vardy does fall easily, but City cannot deny their contribution. Whoever coaches the defence on getting the wrong side of their man is doing a sterling job. For his hat-trick, Vardy put the ball low to the right.</p>

<p>Game over? It most certainly was in the 77th minute, when substitute Maddison cut in from the left and, buoyed by the absence of any challenge or attempt to close him down, pickled out the far, top corner with a beautifully struck shot.</p>

<p>Jamie Vardy is congratulated by his team-mate Tielemans after his penalty pulled Leicester level at the Etihad Stadium</p>

<p>Vardy showed impressive composure from the spot as he scored Leicester's equaliser in the 37th minute of the game</p>

<p>A penalty was awarded to Leicester when Vardy was brought down by Manchester City defender Kyle Walker in the area</p>

<p>Ake pulled one back from a corner, his header his first goal for the club, but even that did not stand for long. From Leicester's next attack, Mendy, who looks slower this season, tugged Maddison back for Leicester's third penalty of the game. It was taken by Tielemans, with Vardy already off, although the execution made no difference at all. Top class, as were Leicester.</p>

<p>Brendan Rodgers has a gameplan against Manchester City, and it serves him well in a limited fashion. Coming into this game, he had never won a Premier League match against them as Leicester manager – never got so much as a point, in fact – but it gets him close.</p>

<p>It took a wonder goal from Vincent Kompany to win here in 2019, Leicester took the lead before losing the following season, and only a goal from Gabriel Jesus ten minutes from time separated them the third time Rodgers' Leicester and Pep Guardiola met.</p>

<p>Vardy scored his second goal of the game as he found the net with a superb flick past Ederson in the 54th minute</p>

<p>In the 58th minute, Vardy completed his hat-trick as he scored his second penalty of the game to make it 3-0 to Leicester</p>

<p>Tielemans celebrates scoring a penalty for Leicester late on as Brendan Rodgers' side secured a hugely impressive victory</p>

<p>Rodgers lets City's defence have the ball. Instead of pressing them, his players retreat. Rodgers believes Ederson is a better passer than the four men directly in front of him so, put the squeeze on, and City go backwards, Ederson clips a lovely pass into midfield and, suddenly, City have the better numbers to counter attack. Drop deep and that same area is congested. Also, the defenders are likely to be less accurate in their passing.</p>

<p>And that was Rodgers strategy here, too. The challenge was sticking too it once City had taken the lead inside four minutes. Yet Leicester did. And, admirably, they were rewarded with an equalising goal and another right game. It may be frustrating for Leicester supporters to see their team play like cup tie giant-killers – but it does cause City problems.</p>

<p>They had just two real goalscoring chances in the first-half, one of which was the wonderful goal from Riyad Mahrez that might have scuppered a team with less resolve. </p>

<p>Riyad Mahrez is congratulated by his Manchester City team-mates after his goal put his side in the lead in the early stages</p>

<p>Mahrez found the top corner against his former club as he managed to score with a superb effort at the Etihad Stadium</p>

<p>It came from the first attack of the half, a corner swung in and cleared by James Justin, straight to the feet of the lurking Mahrez. He returned it with venom, a shot that flew into the top left corner, taken with his right, and supposedly weaker, foot.</p>

<p>A Kevin De Bruyne free-kick which Fernandinho headed directly as Kasper Schmeichel was City's only other opportunity before half-time and while Leicester were not exactly overburdened with opportunity they got the one break necessary to equalise – if Jamie Vardy is in your team.</p>

<p>It came in the 36th minute when Harvey Barnes broke through, and fed Vardy, who got goal side of Kyle Walker. The City man clumsily tried to correct his error and it rarely requires a sledgehammer to take Vardy down. Once Michael Oliver had signalled the penalty, Vardy finished the job himself, powerful and into the top left corner, as he had twice on the opening weekend against West Brom. </p>

<p>Nathan Ake scored his first goal for Manchester City in the closing stages of the game but in the end it mattered little</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling was deployed up front, with Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus both absent because of injuries</p>

<p>17-year-old striker Liam Delap replaced Fernandinho to make his Premier League debut for Manchester City in the second half</p>

<p>Recap the action as it happened below. </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Wow. What a stunning match that was, and surely Pep Guardiola is facing more questions than ever before in his managerial career.</p>

<p>Thanks for joining me and remember to keep an eye out for all the reaction to all of today's action.</p>

<p>Where on earth has that result come from then? Pep Guardiola's men suffer defeat in their first Premier League home game of the season and once again it is Jamie Vardy who has inspired Leicester.</p>

<p>On any normal day Riyad Mahrez's stunner would be well talked about but today it will be nothing more than a sidenote after Jamie Vardy netted a hat-trick at the Etihad including a delightful near-post dink.</p>

<p>James Maddison scored a brilliant fourth with a screamer before Tielemans rounded off the win with another Leicester penalty.</p>

<p>Pep Guardiola looks absolutely shellshocked on the touchline here. They dropped eight points from their first eight games last season, and now Liverpool will be encouraged by what they have seen today.</p>

<p>Leicester did not beat aside away from home that finished above them last season, but they are going to get their first win at the Etihad since their Premier League winning season.</p>

<p>Four added minutes.</p>

<p>A third penalty for City and a third converted spot kick as Youri Tielemans steps up in the absence of the substituted Vardy to send Ederson the wrong way.</p>

<p>Another horrendous City mistake in defending, and another penalty for Leicester City.</p>

<p>This time it is Benjamin Mendy who is the guilty party, tugging back James Maddison as he is caught out positionally again.</p>

<p>The final change for Leicester, as Vardy, still moving gingerly, comes on for Iheanacho.</p>

<p>It looks like it will only be a consolation, but Nathan Ake nets his first goal for the club, heading into the corner from Mahrez's corner. Game on?</p>

<p>You know when Kevin De Bruyne has run out of ideas that you have had a bad day, and the Belgian can only fire over as frustration grows for Guardiola's side.</p>

<p>Jonny Evans isn't moving too cleverly as he comes off here for Christian Fuchs, which will add to Rodgers' woes despite the incredible result they are about to pull off.</p>

<p>We have seen some absolutely brilliant goals today, but that may just top the lot, as Maddison gets his first goal since returning from his injury.</p>

<p>He drives at the City defence and then unleashes a drive from the left of the area which beats Ederson and rubs salt into the wound.</p>

<p>2 &amp; 2 - Jamie Vardy is the first player to win two penalties and score two penalties in a single Premier League game since Milan Baros for Liverpool against Crystal Palace in November 2004. Involved. #MCILEI pic.twitter.com/3k77HpPIta</p>

<p>18 - Only Raheem Sterling (19) has won more penalties than Jamie Vardy (18) in Premier League history. Tumbling. pic.twitter.com/WALKdzFyRF</p>

<p>Harvey Barnes threatens to add a fourth as City look to reduce the deficit here with time running out for a flat Man City.</p>

<p>Another chance for City, but Sterling was always stretching for the header which goes over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some concern for Leicester, with Jamie Vardy appearing to hold his right groin. But while that is going on, James Maddison is brought on for Dennis Praet, who hobbles away with a problem of his own.</p>

<p>City have just over a quarter of this contest left to rectify what has been a worrying performance.</p>

<p>But Leicester seem to have cracked the code and are holding their hosts at arm's length right now.</p>

<p>I have finally had a chance to catch a breather after a dramatic ten minutes at the Etihad here.</p>

<p>Kyle Walker tests Schmeichel with an effort before Liam Delap is inches away from his first Premier League goal, with his header clipping the bar.</p>

<p>Ferran Torres meanwhile comes on for City in their second change for Phil Foden.</p>

<p>This time he slots his effort low but it is the same result despite Ederson going the right way.</p>

<p>A Premier League hat-trick for Vardy at the Etihad Stadium today! A very destructive three goals and we have not played an hour.</p>

<p>Again it is Vardy who wins it and again it is the striker getting the better of the Man City centre-backs.</p>

<p>Barnes again feeds Vardy who is bundled over by Eric Garcia, who again is the wrong side, and Oliver has no hesitation in pointing to the spot.</p>

<p>I don't quite know how to describe just what Jamie Vardy has just done.</p>

<p>The wounds are reappearing for City, with Tielemans finding the run of Castagne, who cuts it back to Vardy.</p>

<p>The striker still has so much to do after heading towards the near post, and he manages to dink it delicately over Ederson to give the visitors the lead.</p>

<p>You would fancy Mahrez to test Schmeichel from that distance, but after getting possession high up the Algerian whips his effort wide.</p>

<p>Guardiola meanwhile has changed City's system to a 4-4-2.</p>

<p>Having scored on his League Cup debut in midweek, Rory Delap's son Liam is brought on for Fernandinho to give City some natural centre forward play.</p>

<p>Looks like we are about to witness a Premier League debut for Man City's Liam Delap, as Daniel Amartey goes into the book after a foul on De Bruyne.</p>

<p>Second booking of the game for the visitors goes to Soyuncu for a late challenge on Rodri.</p>

<p>Positive intent from De Bruyne early in the second half here, but he is forced wide which is exactly where his left-foot shot went.</p>

<p>Jamie Vardy gets us going again at the Etihad Stadium. What an intriguing 45 minutes we have ahead of us.</p>

<p>"It's perfect - what a goal." 😍Wait for the reverse angle of this Riyad Mahrez strike...🤤🎥📺 Watch on Sky Sports PL📱 Follow #MCILEI here: https://t.co/K83lQ3EhuI📲 Download the @SkySports app! pic.twitter.com/fSDVET4Lp9</p>

<p>Jamie Vardy has scored 7 times against Pep Guardiola's Man City, which is more than Lionel Messi.</p>

<p>6 - Jamie Vardy has scored six league goals against Pep Guardiola's Manchester City - twice as many as any other Premier League player. Indeed, this is also two more than any other player against Guardiola sides in his European top-flight career. Thorn. #MCILEI pic.twitter.com/PWYmvS2yeh</p>

<p>Some of the old failings from last season coming to the fore for Manchester City as the first half is brought to an end by Michael Oliver.</p>

<p>It all started so well for Pep Guardiola's men when Riyad Mahrez fired in a rocket just four minutes into the game to score against his former club.</p>

<p>But having dominated most of the possession, Kyle Walker's clumsy challenge on Jamie Vardy saw the striker continue his excellent goalscoring form against Man City.</p>

<p>Leicester were slow starters once again but Vardy's penalty has given them hope here. Plenty for Pep to think about.</p>

<p>One minute added on at the end of the half as Leicester earn a corner following a great run from Soyuncu.</p>

<p>The hosts are very open now, and were it not for Eric Garcia who does brilliantly to track Harvey Barnes the visitors could have had further joy here.</p>

<p>This has really changed the complexion of this game. Pep Guardiola's side lost nine times last season, and the defence has proved their Achilles again despite dominating most of the game.</p>

<p>Emphatic penalty from Vardy, who has been living off scraps so far today but thunders this spot kick into the top corner. The visitors are somehow level.</p>

<p>Not great defending from Kyle Walker there.</p>

<p>Harvey Barnes plays a cute pass past Eric Garcia to Jamie Vardy. Walker then realises he is the wrong side and makes contact with the former England striker, who goes down and wins his side the penalty.</p>

<p>The offside flag saves Leicester from conceding a second.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Fernandinho had a free header from a De Bruyne free-kick, this time it is Rodri's turn.</p>

<p>The Spaniard finds the net, but Jonny Evans' offside appeals are correct and the header is ruled out.</p>

<p>City have managed to take the sting out of Leicester's relatively brief play in their attacking third, but Phil Foden has looked a little shaky in possession and has conceded possession cheaply on a couple of times.</p>

<p>De Bruyne meanwhile is showing his best, whipping in a delicious ball which neither Sterling nor Mahrez attack.</p>

<p>Much better from the visitors in the last five minutes, who have found their belief and started to probe at the City defence with crosses into the box.</p>

<p>Big chance for both sides in a few minutes here.</p>

<p>Firstly, Fernandinho heads a free header from a De Bruyne free-kick straight into Schmeichel's hands, before Garcia tracks back at the other end to intercept a Justin cross destined for Vardy.</p>

<p>The only way Leicester City could show more respect to Manchester City at the moment is by serving them drinks at half-time. Not offering anything in attack.</p>

<p>A first booking of the game for Youri Tielemans, who is cautioned for tugging back compatriot De Bruyne.</p>

<p>A rare corner for Leicester after they finally get into good positions up the field. Barnes' end product at West Brom was not up to standard and it needs to be better today as Eric Garcia easily gets it behind.</p>

<p>Stunning play again from De Bruyne, getting up off his feet to flick a ball through to Sterling, who exchanges a one-two before firing into the arms of Schmeichel at the near post.</p>

<p>Manchester City have had 81 per cent of the ball so far in this match, with Leicester sitting very deep and isolating the likes of Jamie Vardy and Harvey Barnes.</p>

<p>58 - Making his 200th @premierleague appearance today, Riyad Mahrez has scored his 58th goal in the division - at 3 minutes and 11 seconds, it's the earliest of his 58 such strikes. Technique. #MCILEI pic.twitter.com/D7uBy29A32</p>

<p>Nathan Ake has had an assured start to life at Man City but in truth he has had little to do on his home debut so far, and his side are dominating the midfield and have a chance of a second, but Rodri fires over from outside the area.</p>

<p>Harvey Barnes has looked like Leicester's most likely outlet so far but so far it is the visiting defenders have seen most of the action, with blocks going into to stop shots from De Bruyne and Fernandinho.</p>

<p>That really has thrown Plan A out of the window for Brendan Rodgers, as his side face a barrage from City down the flanks.</p>

<p>Leicester need to try and get their back line-up but haven't managed in the early exchanges.</p>

<p>What a stunning strike that is from Riyad Mahrez against his former club.</p>

<p>De Bruyne's corner is nodded away by Justin but no one is anywhere near Mahrez who doesn't take a touch and just slams an effort with his weaker right foot into the top corner.</p>

<p>Schmeichel was motionless as the Algerian's rocket nestled just inside the post.</p>

<p>Leicester very much set up in their five at the back, with Daniel Amartey joining the returning Jonny Evans as well as Caglar Soyuncu.</p>

<p>Harvery Barnes then breaks after some City possession but Kyle Walker matches him.</p>

<p>It is the hosts who get us underway at the Etihad, with Raheem Sterling set to lead the City line. Can Brendan Rodgers get the better of a City side for the first time?</p>

<p>So, players getting ready in the tunnel at the Etihad Stadium, as we approach kick-off in the third Premier League game of the day.</p>

<p>A great sign to see Eric Garcia back, who is using some headgear reminiscent of Chivu...</p>

<p>Not since 1989-90 have Man City lost their opening home game of a top-flight season, and a Phil Foden's goal saw them progress in midweek, but Arsenal however ensured Leicester's League Cup run ended on Wednesday.</p>

<p>You would expect it given their status as champions for two of the last three seasons, but Man City's home form is something to behold.</p>

<p>they have won 10 and lost none of their last 11 Premier League outings at the Etihad Stadium and have won the last seven of those by an aggregate score of 26-1.</p>

<p>He's been good lately, and Leicester will need all the brilliance from their star man today.</p>

<p>So a first home Premier League game of the new season for Manchester City, following their comfortable albeit fortunate victory at Wolves.</p>

<p>Both sides come into this game with 100% records, and Leicester will be buoyed by what they saw at Molineux.</p>

<p>And the Etihad looks resplendent in the sunshine...</p>
