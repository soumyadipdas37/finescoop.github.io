        <p>Gary Lineker's brother Wayne has said that despite having 'more temptation' from women thanks to his 'lean physique', he isn't a bad boyfriend. </p>

<p>The father-of-four appeared on Good Morning Britain via video link from Ibiza, the day after being criticised online for revealing a list of criteria for his future girlfriend - which includes 'giving up her career, having no children, and having a defined body'. </p>

<p>The 58-year-old appeared alongside British actor Tamer Hassan, 52, to debate whether women prefer men with 'dad bods', and the bar owner admitted that men with toned bodies are more likely to 'distract themselves from their relationship'.</p>

<p>However Wayne, who owns Ibiza's famous Ocean Beach nightclub, feels that while he may have 'more temptation' because of increased attention from women, it all comes down to the individual, and that he doesn't have a 'cheater's mindset'. </p>

<p>Scroll down for video </p>

<p>Gary Lineker's brother Wayne (pictured centre, surrounded by women) revealed his bizarre criteria for his future girlfriend - which includes 'giving up her career, having no children, being able to cook and having a defined body' </p>

<p>The father-of-four appeared on Good Morning Britain in a bizarre interview today where he insisted that despite having 'more temptation' from women thanks to his toned body, he isn't a 'bad boyfriend'</p>

<p>Speaking about a survey which suggests women don't look for toned partners, host  Kate Garraway asked: 'Do you feel cross that after all the effort to stay fit and toned it may not be what women are after?'</p>

<p>A confused Wayne replied: 'I'm not so sure to be honest, are we talking about what women want here?'</p>

<p>After explaining the debate once again to Wayne, Kate admitted: 'I'm a bit worried you don't know why you're here.' </p>

<p>Finally answering the question, Wayne went on: 'Well, no. I don't really understand that to be honest. I don't think there's a difference in people's personality, if they're over weight or under weight really.</p>

<p>The 58-year-old appeared alongside British actor Tamer Hassan (pictured left), 52, to debate whether women prefer men with 'dad bods'</p>

<p>'The guys with the better bodies get more temptation to distract themselves from their relationship, but as far as a decent boyfriend or husband is concerned I think once you're a cheat you're always a cheat. </p>

<p>'It's all about the mind-set and fortunately it's not a mindset of mine,. I've never been a cheater, but I'll keep my lean physique if that's okay.' </p>

<p>He explained that he hasn't been able to keep as fit as usual due to a shoulder injury, saying: 'Normally I would go five times a week, it's something I enjoy. </p>

<p>'I like to make myself look the best I can, but that doesn’t mean I’m not a good boyfriend.'</p>

<p>Yesterday, the club owner shared his bizarre list of criteria, which included being able to cook 'Waitrose ready meals' and 'loving R&amp;B'.   </p>

<p>The list was posted to the club owner's Instagram account with the hashtag 'banter' but sparked outrage on social media from followers disgusted with Wayne's demands - such as 'loving the gym and having body definition' and not being the same age as him because 'that would just look weird'.</p>

<p>The list (above) was posted to the club owner's Instagram account with the hashtag 'banter' but sparked criticism on social media from followers disgusted with Wayne's demands</p>

<p>'Truly unprecedented levels of creep exuding from Wayne Lineker these days,' one unimpressed Twitter user wrote.</p>

<p>Father-of-four Wayne has been married once and has had several girlfriends, but is thought to have been single since his 2018 split from ex-fiancée Danielle Sandhu in 2018, who was 31 years his junior. </p>

<p>Last month, Wayne hit back at haters who criticised a video shared of him picking which 'dream doll' to take on a date at his club in Ibiza - and knocking the rejected women in the pool by their chests.</p>

<p>Following the criticism of his criteria, Wayne added to his message: 'This post is purely tongue in cheek banter.'</p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, Wayne wrote: 'So, my family have decided I need a girlfriend for my own sanity and health...so here’s my criteria. </p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, Wayne (pictured centre, surrounded by a group of women) wrote: 'So, my family have decided I need a girlfriend for my own sanity and health...so here’s my criteria' </p>

<p>Wayne, pictured, added: 'You must like older men but only me...You have to be a worldly and above 30 (OK, 28 or 29 could work) but not my age as that would just look weird'</p>

<p>'OK, let’s start this off like I’m normal: strong, nice, and loving personality. Now to more important things:</p>

<p>'You must like older men but only me...You have to be a worldly and above 30 (OK, 28 or 29 could work) but not my age as that would just look weird.</p>

<p>'You must like to travel and to fly business class and stay in incredible hotels. Be prepared to give up your career or job or at least be able to work from a laptop on a tropical beach somewhere. </p>

<p>Despite finishing the post with '#banter', some social media users (above) were left unimpressed with Wayne's demands</p>

<p>'You will need to spend the summer in Ibiza and the winter in Dubai with two weeks in the UK for Christmas and New Year with the families and holidays to the Maldives.'</p>

<p>The club owner then explained that any potential love interest should come without children because his 'are all grown up'. However, he added that 'a dog is acceptable' if they have a passport.</p>

<p>He continued: 'You must be able to cook as I love cooking, especially Waitrose ready made meals. You also don’t need to be verified I can sort that for you. </p>

<p>'House music and R&amp;B lovers only. No heavy rock or pop music. You must like Netflix especially Money Heist and also real crime. No chick flicks, watch them with your mates. </p>

<p>'You need to be confident enough to be able to go to the front of the queue in nightclubs and accept a table and free drinks from the owners.'</p>

<p>Father-of-four Wayne has been married once and has had several girlfriends, but is thought to have been single since his 2018 split from ex-fiancée Danielle Sandhu (pictured together) in 2018, who was 31 years his junior</p>

<p>Last month, Wayne hit back at haters who criticised a video shared of him picking which 'dream doll' to take on a date at his club in Ibiza - and knocking the rejected women in the pool by their chests (pictured) </p>

<p>Wayne insisted that any girlfriends should have a driving license to share his Bentley and a future 'Lamborghini Jeep' purchase. </p>

<p>He also refused to consider any women who have shared teeth whitening posts, appear on OnlyFans, or dating websites, and who are 'boring' or bad at geography.</p>

<p>'You must love the gym, healthy food and have body definition as I will have soon,' he added. 'Accept and love my children and grandchildren and realise no more kids for me.. (never say never though).</p>

<p>'You must be able to let my PA book all yours and our flights and purchase items online for you. You must be able to accept my friends as I will accept yours, and accept I have to reply to girls direct messages and not just guys.'</p>

<p>Despite finishing the post with '#banter', some social media users were left unimpressed with Wayne's criteria. </p>

<p>However, some people (pictured above) could see the funny side of Wayne's announcement</p>

<p>Wayne (pictured) also refused to consider any women who have shared teeth whitening posts, appear on OnlyFans, or dating websites, and who are 'boring' or bad at geography</p>

<p>One person wrote: 'Wayne Lineker is an actual embarrassment, nah I'm not having it. How is a man of 58 years of age seriously writing a girlfriend requirement list on his Instagram. Don't know what's worse, that or the sad and desperate girls about to message him.</p>

<p>'Has Wayne Lineker been hacked or is he just being himself? Hard to say', another person mocked.</p>

<p>'Wayne Lineker should be banned off all social media in my opinion' a third added. 'Bad vibes. Gary Lineker, sort him out, will you.' </p>

<p>However, some people could see the funny side of Wayne's announcement and said: 'You tell 'em Wayne', while a second added: 'Bro this is gold.' </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Wayne's representative for comment. </p>

<p>Entrepreneur Wayne Lineker, from Leicester, is the younger brother of former British footballer Gary Lineker. </p>

<p>The 58-year-old, who now lives in Essex in the winter, owns several bars, clubs and restaurants across Europe, including Linekers Bar in Marbella, Spain, and O Beach in Ibiza, which are often visited by celebrities and reality stars. </p>

<p>Father-of-four Wayne has had several girlfriends and has been married once before. </p>

<p>Nightclub owner Wayne Lineker, 58, was once regarded as a better footballing prospect than his brother Gary </p>

<p>He had all his children with his first wife, including three daughters Duane, Tia and Sean and a son called Freddie.  </p>

<p>The business owner and grandfather has reportedly been single since he split from his ex-fiancée Danielle Sandhu, 27, in 2018 after meeting at his club.  </p>

<p>At the age of 14 he left school and worked with his father, a greengrocer, selling fruit and vegetables. </p>

<p>Growing up he and Gary would play football together but Wayne never pursued it as a professional career despite being once regarded as a better footballing prospect. </p>

<p>Wayne and his brother are said to be estranged and reports in 2015 suggested their rift began in 2008 when Gary took his bride-to-be Danielle Bux to meet Wayne. </p>

<p>Following an uncomfortable first meeting Wayne's then girlfriend Ana Tanaka was not invited to the couple's wedding on the Amalfi coast despite being together for 18 months. As a result, he declined the invitation. </p>
