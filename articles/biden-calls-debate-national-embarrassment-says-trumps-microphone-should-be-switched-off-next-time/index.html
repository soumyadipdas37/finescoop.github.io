    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden kicked off a train tour Wednesday and immediately began railing against Donald Trump after last night's vicious standoff at the first presidential debate – which he called an 'embarrassment.'</p>

<p>Speaking at a small rail station in Alliance, Ohio, he blasted Trump as out of touch, and said he can understand why debate viewers would be turned off by the spectacle.</p>

<p>'I can understand it. I kind of thought at one point, and maybe I shouldn’t say this, but the president of the United States conducting himself the way he did, I think it was just a national embarrassment,' Biden said.</p>

<p>Biden confirmed during the Wednesday morning stop that he will participate in the following two debates as questions arose over whether he would still do so following the disastrous first face-off.</p>

<p>He said he is getting ready for the next debate, which will be in a town hall format hosted by C-SPAN’s Steve Scully in Miami, Florida - and floated the idea of using technology to rein in Trump.</p>

<p>'I just hope there’s a way in which the debate commission can control the ability of us to answer the question without interruption,' he said, suggesting his microphone be muted if the president interrupts him.</p>

<p>'I’m coming into places where people are hurting. Where people have lost their jobs,' Biden said of his train trip through the two battleground rust-belt states.</p>

<p>He cast Trump as being out for himself and ignoring the voters during the angry prime time clash.</p>

<p>'Does you president have any idea, understand what you’re going through? And if he does, does he care about it?' he said, bringing up the debate hours after it ended.</p>

<p>'Or does he just ignore you, look down on you, lie to you, like this president did?' he said.</p>

<p>'What I saw last night was all about him. He didn’t speak to you or you concerns or the American people even once.' </p>

<p>Morning after: Joe Biden boarded a chartered Amtrak train for a whistle stop tour of eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Ohio has become competitive and polls in Pennsylvania have swung to put him ahead in the must-win state</p>

<p>Chartered train: Joe Biden climbed on board the Amtrak car for a tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania the morning after the first presidential debate - a clash called the worse in history</p>

<p>On the train: Joe Biden traveled first from Cleveland to Alliance, Ohio on his specially branded Amtrak charter, with his a few aides and journalists on board</p>

<p> Democratic allies are suggesting Biden not participate in the two debates next month as Tuesday night's face-off quickly devolved into a series of interruptions and personal attacks</p>

<p>'So presidential.' While Biden himself largely did not mention the debate, his wife Jill praised his performance before they boarded the special train in Cleveland</p>

<p>My guy: Jill Biden gave a show of support to her husband Joe after a debate called a 'dumpster fire' for its 90 minutes of acrimony</p>

<p>On board the Biden train: The Democratic candidate started a tour of eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania on a chartered Amtrak train at Cleveland's mainline rail station</p>

<p>Joe Biden will still participate in the remaining two presidential debates, his campaign said Tuesday, despite Tuesday night's first matchup being labeled a 'dumpster fire'</p>

<p>'PROUD BOYS - STAND BACK AND STAND BY'</p>

<p>Trump was asked by Wallace to condemn white supremacists and militias. 'Sure, I'm willing to do that.' 'Then do it, sir,' Wallace said - and Biden shouted 'do it, say it.' Trump asked for a 'name' and Biden said: 'Proud Boys.'</p>

<p>'Proud boys - stand back and stand by! But I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left,' Trump said.</p>

<p> 'SHUT UP'</p>

<p>Biden told Trump: 'Would you shut up, man?,' after getting interrupted repeatedly when discussing the Supreme Court. As Trump spoke over Chris Wallace Biden said: 'Keep yapping.' </p>

<p>HUNTER AND COCAINE</p>

<p>Biden spoke of his dead son Beau's decorated service in Iraq. 'I didn't know Beau. I know Hunter. He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use,' Trump said of Hunter Biden. 'That's not true.' Biden responded. Hunter got an 'administrative discharge.' </p>

<p>'CLOWN SHOW' </p>

<p>'It's hard to get any word in with this clown – excuse me, this person,' Biden said.</p>

<p>TRUMP GOES AFTER BIDEN'S BRAINS </p>

<p>'There's nothing smart about you Joe,' Trump told Biden. Biden had said 'a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter.'</p>

<p>BIDEN GOES AFTER TRUMP ON TRUTH</p>

<p>'Everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he's a liar,' Biden said of Trump. </p>

<p>TRUMP SPARS WITH WALLACE  </p>

<p>Moderator Chris Wallace begging Trump to follow the rules. 'I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer,' he said at one point. </p>

<p>TRUMP CASTS DOUBT ON WHOLE ELECTION </p>

<p>Trump again attacked mail-in ballots. 'This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen.' He said. 'We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over,' he said.  </p>

<p>TRUMP'S WAR WITH WALLACE </p>

<p>'I guess I'm debating you and not him but that's okay I'm not surprised.' </p>

<p>BLEACH IN THE ARM </p>

<p>'And by the way maybe inject some bleach into your arm, that'll take care of it,' Biden said, mocking Trump's statement about injecting disinfectant to treat coronavirus.</p>

<p>Biden slammed Trump for failing to condemn the white supremacist group the Proud Boys, and for saying the election would be a scam with mail-in ballots.</p>

<p>'The American people will decide who the next president will be, period,' Biden intoned.</p>

<p>'This president will step down. A lot of bravado. He has no alternative,' he said.  </p>

<p>Biden took just a few questions, and didn't field one about whether he regretted any of his own conduct, where Trump repeatedly interrupted him but he fired off insults of his own.</p>

<p>Biden invoked his birth in Scranton, territory he compared to industrial parts of Ohio that have suffered job losses.</p>

<p>He called the race one 'between Scranton and Park Avenue. Between Alliance and Park Avenue.'</p>

<p>Biden spoke in Alliance, Ohio Wednesday after Tuesday night's nasty smackdown, where he called the president a 'clown' and a 'racist,' and Trump repeatedly interrupted him. </p>

<p>He arrived by train on the first day of a swing through battleground Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>'Riding around Ohio in my favorite means of transportation,' Biden said. He sported an Amtrak baseball cap and wore a black face mask when he began his remarks.</p>

<p>'I’ve ridden a few miles on Amtrak,' he said. 'When I first got started Amtrak didn’t have a police department,' he said at the top,' he said, a day after Donald Trump went after him for failing to identify a police group that was backing him.</p>

<p>'You do a heck of a job, guys. You do a great job,' he said.</p>

<p>The Biden camp had the train roll into a small station in the northeast Ohio town, and invited a small group of supporters to ride with him</p>

<p>At one point during the debate Biden told the president: 'Will you shut up, man,' in just one of many angry exchanges that had some commentators calling the whole episode a 'disgrace.'</p>

<p>The train tour harkened to a supposedly simpler time, after a night filled with vitriol.</p>

<p>Onstage, Biden branded Trump a 'liar' and a 'clown' and also 'a racist' – but sometimes merely sat back and smiled amid Trump's own charges.</p>

<p>During one exchange, Biden told the president to 'shut up.'</p>

<p>Moderator Chris Wallace was helpless to rein in the slug-fest, repeatedly lecturing Trump, to little avail.</p>

<p>Trump, for his part, brought up Biden's son's past cocaine use and inaccurately accused him of getting a dishonorable discharge from the Navy. He called his rival a 'socialist,' and repeatedly tried to tar him with 'radical' elements like antifa.</p>

<p>On the tour, Biden and his wife Jill had early stops in Cleveland and Alliance before choo choo-ing through Western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Alliance is one of a group of towns that went for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but flipped to Donald Trump in 2016. Hillary Clinton just seven of Ohio's 88 counties, and Trump crushed her in Stark County.</p>

<p>The ex-vice president will hold a handful of train station events and end the day doing a 'drive-in' event that is invite-only, as the Biden campaign refuses to flout coronavirus restrictions like President Donald Trump, who's restarted holding large rallies.</p>

<p>After his first wife and baby daughter died after he was elected to the U.S. Senate at the age of 29, Biden decided to commute to Washington, D.C. daily via Amtrak, as a single parent to sons Beau and Hunter.</p>

<p>For Biden that was a daily three-hour trip.</p>

<p>The train he rode Wednesday, an Amtrak passenger train, had a Biden-Harris logo on the front. It had a sign encouraging backers to text "Train" in a show of support to build a voter file.</p>

<p>Although there was a general consensus that neither candidate came out looking good from the first matchup Tuesday, Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield confirmed in a call with reporters following the debate that Biden would participate in the two following face-offs.</p>

<p>'I don't know how many different ways we can say it: Yes, we are going to do the debates,' Bedingfield said. </p>

<p>'I would imagine there will be some additional conversations [with the Commission on Presidential Debates]. But yeah, we are committing to attending the debates,' she vowed.</p>

<p>Trump and Biden shouted over each other and insulted each other for the full 90 minutes as moderator Chris Wallace lost control of the 'dumpster fire' that was the first presidential debate on Tuesday night in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>Biden's running mate Kamala Harris also suggested Tuesday night that Biden would still participate in the remaining two face-offs with Trump'Joe Biden's never going to refuse to talk to the American people,' Harris told CNN when asked if Biden should participate.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Biden opened his day by delivering a speech alongside the rails of Clev eland's Amtrak train station - but did not directly address whether he will debate Trump again, and offered version of his stump speech with little mention of the debate at all.</p>

<p>'Last night's debate and this election is supposed to be about you - about you and all the people I grew up with in Scranton.</p>

<p>'Does your president understand at all what you are going through?' </p>

<p>His wife Jill however did directly address the debate saying: 'Didn't Joe do a great job last night? I thought he was so strong and he looked so presidential.'</p>

<p>The Bidens then boarded a train for a six-stop tour of the east of Ohio and western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Aboard the six-car train: only the Bidens, their campaign staff and a handful of journalists. The train features a Biden-Harris logo and a sign urging supporters to text 'Train' to the campaign to show their support.</p>

<p>Biden spent decades commuting between his home in Delaware and Washington while serving in the Senate. </p>

<p>He announced his 1988 campaign for president, the first of his multiple runs, at the station in Wilmington, Delaware, posing with his family off the back of the train.  </p>

<p>Trump, meanwhile, was scheduled to attend an afternoon fundraiser in Shorewood, Minnesota, a suburb to the west of Minneapolis, before appearing at an evening campaign rally in Duluth on the shores of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>While Trump carried Ohio and Pennsylvania four years ago, he narrowly lost Minnesota, one of the few states he hopes to flip from red to blue this fall. </p>

<p>The president's path to success likely depends on finding more votes in rural, conservative areas and limiting his losses in the state's urban and suburban areas.   </p>

<p>Tuesday's angry and chaotic debate quickly devolved – surpassing prior encounters in force and severity of attacks but also into the constant cross-talk and breakdown of orderly discussion.</p>

<p>Former White House press secretary under President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, said the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates should 'outline a plan for how this is going to work going forward including cutting off mics for interrupting.'</p>

<p>'2020 is far too important to have two more episodes of that,' Gibbs said, adding, 'because that was not a debate.'</p>

<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking on MSNBC, said moderator Chris Wallace should have been able to switch off Trump's microphone to stop the interruptions.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign would not comment on the Tuesday night call with reporters on whether they believe the rules or protocols should be changed for the next debate – including the notion of potentially muting microphones if a candidate attempts to interrupt their rival's allotted time. </p>

<p>Privately, some Biden allies are indicating they don't think the former vice presidential should participate at all in the other two debates.</p>

<p>'I don't think he should debate anymore,' one Biden ally said, according to The Hill. 'There's just no reason to.'</p>

<p>Another agreed, saying, 'What the hell was that? That wasn't a debate. That was one of the worst things I've seen in modern day politics.'</p>

<p>Biden and Trump are schedule to meet for the second time on October 15 in Miami, Florida – where the debate will be held town hall style with moderator Steve Scully.</p>

<p>The third and final debate will take place October 22 in Nashville, Tennessee and will be moderated by NBC's Kristen Welker.</p>

<p>Barely had the evening begun when the two candidates began name calling and fighting, with Biden asking Trump to shut up and slapping him down as the president repeatedly interrupted his answers.</p>

<p>'Would you shut up, man?,' a visibly exasperated Biden said about 20 minutes into the debate as he tried to talk about the Supreme Court but Trump interjected.</p>

<p>And, about 15 minutes later during a discussion on the COVID pandemic, he told Trump again: 'Would you just shush for a minute?' </p>

<p>When it was over CNN's Jake Tapper called it a 'hot mess, inside a dumpster fire, inside a train wreck,' as well as a 'disgrace,' in one of many efforts by commentators to make sense of the carnage. His colleague Dana Bash called it a 's**tshow' - a verdict broadcast in full which rapidly went viral.</p>

<p> Biden spokeswoman Symone Sanders said it was 'just a lot of chaos from Donald Trump.' </p>

<p>Coming into a debate where his team acknowledged he skipped the typical policy cramming of such contests, Trump relentlessly went after Biden – frequently cutting him off mid-sentence. </p>

<p>Biden, determined not to get out-muscled and mindful of Trump's slashing 2016 attacks on Hillary Clinton, came armed with his own insults – branding Trump a 'liar' and a 'clown' and also 'a racist' – but sometimes merely sat back and smiled amid Trump's own charges.</p>

<p>During one exchange, Biden told the president to 'shut up.' Later he said 'you're the worst president that America has ever had.'</p>

<p>Trump, for his part, brought up Biden's son Hunter's past cocaine use and inaccurately accused him of getting a dishonorable discharge from the Navy. He called his rival a 'socialist,' and repeatedly tried to tar him with 'radical' elements like Antifa.  </p>

<p>Barely had the night begun when the two candidates began name calling, fighting and shouting over each other when Biden told Trump to 'shut up'</p>

<p>'Would you shut up, man?,' a visibly exasperated Biden said about 20 minutes into the Cleveland, Ohio debate after Trump interrupted him. 'Would you just shush for a minute?' he said about 15 minutes later</p>

<p>The interuptions and attacks happened so frequently during. the90-minute debate that Fox News' moderator Chris Wallace stepped in. 'I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer' </p>

<p>He tried to yoke Biden to a 'manifesto' of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and accused him of backing the Green New Deal on the environment. Biden said he backs the 'Biden plan.'</p>

<p>Nominal moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News repeatedly lectured Trump, telling him 'I'm the moderator of this debate' at one point. His efforts were mostly fruitless.</p>

<p>But he let the two candidates go at each other for long stretches, seemingly powerless to enforce rules negotiated for months by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential debates. </p>

<p>It was a departure from the one-on-one format where Wallace, who commands the TV stage on 'Fox News Sunday,' this summer cornered Trump with questions about his cognitive test and accepting the results of the election. </p>

<p>When the smoke cleared after 90 minutes of attacks and interruptions that left many viewers floored, it was not evident that Trump had accomplished the game-changing takedown of Biden's that his team was hoping for.  </p>

<p>Even the famously pugnacious former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who helped prep Trump at the White House and urged him to go on the attack, found it to be too much. 'It was too hot. Listen, you come in and decide you want to be aggressive, and I think it was the right thing to be aggressive, but it was too hot,' he said afterward.</p>

<p>Biden entered the debate leading in national polls and in key battlegrounds. Hours before the debate began, the Cook Political Report moved Ohio and Iowa to 'toss-up' status – a sign of the increasing pressure on Trump to change the game. </p>

<p>The state of map upped the pressure on Trump to raise doubts about Biden, whose favorable rating ticked up after the party conventions.</p>

<p>Eschewing repeat formal practice sessions in advance, Trump instead huddled with Christie and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and toggled between his standard riffs and attacks on Biden.</p>

<p>Biden, having heard Trump for weeks describe him as someone who was 'losing it' and 'sleepy' was determined to show voters he wouldn't fall prey to Trump's attacks.</p>

<p>He managed to inject most if not all of his key subject areas: bringing up COVID-19, 200,000 American deaths, Trump's golf, the Affordable Care Act, and casting Trump as someone who cares mainly about himself.</p>

<p>But there were plenty of times he let Trump attacks on him go unanswered, or had meek responses gut buried in his microphone while Trump kept railing against him.  </p>

<p>He only briefly brought up the New York Times bombshell showing Trump paid just $750 in taxes in 2016, and tied it to Trump's 'profligate' 2017 tax law. </p>

<p>He spoke to 'you folks at home' in places like Scranton Pa., and tried to tie the issue to their pocketbooks.  </p>

<p>'How well are you doing. This guy paid a total of $750 in tax!' he said. </p>

<p>When he did get the chance to complete a paragraph, Biden found opportunities to speak directly to the camera, appearing to look past Trump's attacks on him.</p>

<p>'You can't fix the econ until you fix the COVID crisis,' he said. 'He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely,' he said. </p>

<p>'This guy will close down the whole country,' Trump said in response.</p>

<p>'I'm the one that brought back football,' Trump said in the home-state of a Big Ten school. Biden let the claim slide.  </p>

<p>In an early sign of just how petty the debate would become, there was an angry clash over whether Trump was 'smart.'</p>

<p>'A lot of people are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter a lot quicker,' Biden said, speaking of staving off coronavirus deaths. </p>

<p>'Did you use the word 'Smart?' Trump asked, exasperated.</p>

<p>'You said you went to Delaware State but you forgot the name of your college,' he said, bringing up a recent flub. 'You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or the lowest in your class. </p>

<p>'Don't ever use the word smart with me,' Trump told him. 'Don't ever use that word.' </p>

<p>'Oh give me a break, Biden interrupted. </p>

<p>'Because you know what, there's nothing smart about you, Joe.'  </p>

<p>One thing the debate lacked was a surprise stunt from Trump, who famously brought Clinton rape accusers to his first stand-off with Hillary Clinton in 2016 in an effort to rattle his opponent.  </p>

<p>'Would you shut up, man?,' a visibly exasperated Biden said about 20 minutes into the debate after Trump interrupted him again as he tried to talk about the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>And, about 15 minutes later during a discussion on the COVID pandemic, he told Trump again: 'Would you just shush for a minute?' </p>

<p>The president tried to command the stage from out of the box, interrupting his rival repeatedly to make his point, counter Biden, and push himself into the conversation.</p>

<p>It happened so many times that moderate Chris Wallace stepped in, asking the president to let Biden finish his answer.</p>

<p> 'I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer,' Wallace said told Trump.</p>

<p>'Go ahead then,' Trump said and then later adding to Wallace: 'I guess I'm debating you, not him. No surprise.'  </p>

<p>After the debate had ended, the candidate's wives joined them on stage, Trump grabbed Melania's hand as the crowd cheered</p>

<p>The 90-minute show down between the presidential contenders proved early on that it would a be a knock-out, drag-down match, as they squared off over the Supreme Court, handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump's taxes, Hunter Biden's business dealings and the Black Lives Matter movement</p>

<p>'You'll get to see it.' Trump shrugs off controversy over his taxes, saying he paid 'millions' as Biden says President 'pays less tax than a schoolteacher' </p>

<p>Trump wouldn't say when he will finally make his personal taxes public as he has long promised, but claimed he paid 'millions of dollars in taxes'.</p>

<p>Wallace had to bring up questions over Trump's taxes after the New York Times released a report this week with sources claiming the president only paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for president and first year he served in office.</p>

<p>'I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year. I went –' the president said, but was interrupted by Biden.</p>

<p>'Show us your tax returns,' the former vice president insisted.</p>

<p>'You'll see it as soon as it's finished. You'll see it,' Trump said.</p>

<p>'Oh,' Biden sarcastically conceded.</p>

<p>Biden said Trump 'takes advantage of the tax code' and 'pays less tax than a schoolteacher.'</p>

<p>Trump shrugged off the attack, saying that all business leaders do the same 'unless they are stupid.'</p>

<p>He suggested that he was able to lessen his tax burden by using legal measures he claims were passed by the Obama administration.</p>

<p>'Let me just tell you, it was the tax laws,' Trump said, admitting: 'I don't want to pay tax.'</p>

<p>'Before I came here I was a private developer, I was a private businessperson,' he continued. 'Like every other private person, unless they're stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is.'</p>

<p>Then pointing to Biden on the opposite side of the stage, Trump added, 'He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits – we built a building and we get tax credits.'</p>

<p>Just hours before taking the stage in the battleground rust belt state Tuesday, Biden and his vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris released their tax returns.</p>

<p>'Stand back and standby.' Trump's response when asked to condemn white supremacists and militia groups  </p>

<p>Trump skirted a question from Wallace about whether he was willing to condemn white supremacists and militia groups.</p>

<p>'I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not the right wing,' Trump responded. 'I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace.'</p>

<p>When pressed further, Trump said: 'What do you want to call them? Give me a name. Give me a name?'</p>

<p>Finally, he said: 'Proud Boys — Stand back, stand by, but I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem..... This is a left wing problem.'</p>

<p>Antifa followers have appeared at anti-racism protests, but there's been little evidence behind Republican claims that Antifa members are to blame for the violence at such protests.</p>

<p>Trump infamously said there were good people 'on both sides' after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that led to the death of a counter-protester. </p>

<p>What Trump said to Biden</p>

<p>China ate your lunch, Joe. </p>

<p>There's nothing smart about you, Joe. </p>

<p>You could never have done the job we've done, you don't have it in your blood.</p>

<p>His family, we could talk all night.</p>

<p>What Biden said to Trump</p>

<p>Folks, do you have any idea what this clown's doing?</p>

<p>He wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn. </p>

<p>Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential. </p>

<p>You're the worst president America has ever had.</p>

<p>Biden calls Trump a 'racist' when the two men debated race relations</p>

<p>Trump was defending his decision to end racial sensitivity training for federal workers when his Democratic rival hit him with the 'racist' label.</p>

<p>The president said the training was resulting in 'very sick ideas' and teaching people 'to hate our country.'</p>

<p>'If you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. It really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country,' Trump said.</p>

<p>'Nobody is doing that. He's racist,' Biden said. </p>

<p>He defended the training programs.</p>

<p>'The fact is there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like. What insults them, what is it demeaning to them. It's important to people. Now, many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings, but it makes a big difference,' he said.</p>

<p>And then he pivoted it to emphasize his blue-collar roots and hinted Trump is a snob.</p>

<p>Biden said: 'It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people and look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics like me who grew up in Scranton.   </p>

<p>'They looked down on people who don't have money, they looked down on people who are of a different faith.'</p>

<p>Race relations, like other debate topics, resulted in a furious back-and-forth, shouting over each other's conversation between the presidential contenders.</p>

<p>As the two men bickered on race, Biden invoked the death of George Floyd, the African American man killed by a white police officer in Minnesota and the Black Lives Matter protests that sprung up in the wake. Trump invoked his 'law and order' presidency.</p>

<p>The president has accused Biden on multiple occasions of wanting to defund the police, which Biden has said he would not do.</p>

<p>During the debate, the Democratic nominee said most police officers are 'good' but the bad ones need to be rooted out.</p>

<p>'The vast majority of police officers are good, they risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples and when they occur, when they find them they have to be sorted out,' Biden said.</p>

<p>'Cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable. And by the way, violence and response is never appropriate. Never appropriate. Peaceful protest is. Violence is never appropriate,' he said of protests.</p>

<p>'Proud Boys — Stand back, stand by,' Trump said when asked to condemn the group (pictured here during a gathering in Portland, Oregon last week). 'But I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not right-wing problem..... This is a left wing problem,' the president said</p>

<p>Trump hit back: 'What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town and burn down stores and kill people all over the place? That is not peaceful protest.'</p>

<p>The president also has complained Biden hasn't said he's for 'law and order,' a phrase Trump has used to define his presidency.</p>

<p>'They don't want to talk about law and order. Are you in favor of law and order?,' he asked Biden.</p>

<p>'I'm in favor of law,' Biden said.</p>

<p>But he attacked Trump's approach of handling racial unrest across America.</p>

<p>'The point is that is why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and saying let's get everybody together, figure out how to deal with this, what does he do? He just throws gasoline on the fire constantly. Every single solitary time,' he said.</p>

<p>'It is what it is' Biden blasts Trump over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic</p>

<p>Trump and Biden fought over the coronavirus crisis by accusing each other of killing more people had the other been in office.</p>

<p>'He panicked or he just looked at the stock market, one of the two, because guess what, a lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker,' Biden said onstage. </p>

<p>At another point Trump shouted it would have been Biden who'd have killed more - calling his response to swine flu pandemic in 2009 a 'disaster.' </p>

<p>Biden, who was serving as vice president at the time, hit back that 14,000 died not 200,000. 'We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy that he shut down,' Biden added.</p>

<p>'If we would've listened to you, the country would've been left wide open, millions of people would've died. Not 200,000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should've never happened,' the president said. </p>

<p>Biden shot back that the president 'waited and waited' to act when the virus reached America's shores and 'still doesn't have a plan.' </p>

<p>Biden told Trump to 'get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap' and go in his golf cart to the Oval Office to come up with a bipartisan plan to save people. </p>

<p>'You're the worst president America has ever had,' Biden said.  </p>

<p>Trump snarled a response, declaring that 'I'll tell you Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood.'</p>

<p>'I know how to do the job,' was the solemn response from Biden, who served eight years as Barack Obama's vice president.  </p>

<p>While discussing the importance of masks to protect against the virus, Trump defended himself for not wearing one all the time, before poking fun at Biden for wearing 'the biggest mask he's ever seen'</p>

<p>Biden whacked Trump for coddling China in the early weeks of the pandemic, saying that the president didn't push hard enough to letter American health experts in.  </p>

<p>'He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing, he told us we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us,' Biden said.   </p>

<p>The ex-veep mocked Trump for saying the coronavirus would disappear 'like a miracle.'  </p>

<p>'And maybe you can inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it,' Biden also offered. </p>

<p>'That was said sarcastically,' Trump shot back.   </p>

<p>While discussing the importance of masks to protect against the virus, Trump defended himself for not wearing one all the time, before poking fun at Biden for wearing 'the biggest mask he's ever seen'.  </p>

<p> Biden also pointed out Trump retorted 'it is what it is', as more than 200,000 Americans have died from the deadly virus. </p>

<p>Biden's son Hunter and late son Beau are brought into the debate </p>

<p>More than an hour into the angry clash, Biden said Trump 'never keeps his word,' and brought up comments that sources told the Atlantic Trump made about fallen troops – referring to them as 'suckers' and 'losers.' Trump again denied it.</p>

<p>Biden made an impassioned pitch for his late son Beau's military service. He spent a year in Iraq serving in the National Guard.</p>

<p>'Speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military — the way you talk about them being losers and being, and just being suckers — my son was in Iraq and he spent a year there,' Biden said.</p>

<p>'He got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot. And the people left behind there were heroes,' said Biden.</p>

<p>'You talking about Hunter?' Trump asked, rhetorically after Biden mentioned his son.</p>

<p>Biden answered he was speaking of Beau.</p>

<p>'I don't know Beau. I know Hunter,' Trump interrupted, then amped up his attacks.</p>

<p>'He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use. And he didn't have a job until you became vice president,' Trump said.</p>

<p>'That's not true. None of that is true,' Biden responded.</p>

<p>'He made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow, in various other places,' Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump brought up a Senate Republican report that claimed Hunter got $3.5 million from the wealthy wife of the former Mayor of Moscow. Hunter Biden's lawyer has denied the characterization</p>

<p>Trump falsely claims to have the support of Portland sheriff</p>

<p>Hunter Biden received an administrative discharge from the Navy in after failing a drug test for cocaine in 2013. He was seeking to be commissioned as a reserve officer. He did not receive a dishonorable discharge, but an administrative one, according to press accounts at the time.</p>

<p>Biden responded: 'My son, like a lot of people we know at home, he had a drug problem.'</p>

<p>'He's fixed it. He's worked on it,' Biden said. 'And I'm proud of him.' </p>

<p>Earlier in the night, Trump hook yet another shot at Hunter, saying: 'And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars.'  It was a reference to business Hunter Biden did with his firm Rosemont Seneca Partners, LLC.</p>

<p>Trump brought up a Senate Republican report that claimed Hunter got $3.5 million from the wealthy wife of the former Mayor of Moscow. Hunter Biden's lawyer has denied the characterization.</p>

<p>'What did he do to deserve it?' Trump asked.</p>

<p>'My son did nothing wrong in Burisa,' said Biden – after Trump expanded his attack to Hunter Biden's lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.</p>

<p>It resulted in still more angry cross talk.</p>

<p>'He doesn't want to let me answer because he knows I have the truth,' Biden said.</p>

<p>'It's hard to get any word in with this clown – excuse me, this person,' Biden said after delivering the insult.</p>

<p>'His family we could talk about all night,' Biden said, but it was difficult to see how he followed through as Trump talked over him.</p>

<p>Then, Biden faced the camera and delivered one of several lines he appeared to have prepared to deliver. 'This is not about my family or his family. It's about your family,' he told viewers.</p>

<p>'He doesn't want to talk about what you need … The American people. That's what we're talking about here.' </p>

<p>Trump defended his effort to swiftly fill a U.S. Supreme Court seat with conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett, saying 'elections have consequences' and he had the right despite Democratic objections</p>

<p>Battle over Supreme Court nominee  </p>

<p>Trump defended his effort to swiftly fill a U.S. Supreme Court seat, saying 'elections have consequences' and he had the right despite Democratic objections.</p>

<p>'I will tell you very simply we won the election, elections have consequences. We have the Senate and we have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all,' Trump said in defense of his nominee, conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett.</p>

<p>'... I think that she (Barrett) will be outstanding. She will be as good as anybody who has ever served on that court. We won the election and therefore we had the right to choose her.' </p>

<p>Biden, talking over frequent interruptions from Trump, said the seat of the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg should be filled after the Nov. 3 election, when it was clear who the president would be.</p>

<p>'We should wait, we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is,' Biden said, adding a more conservative Supreme Court would endanger the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare. </p>

<p>Trump won't say if he'll accept election results, claiming mail-in ballots will lead to 'fraud like you've never seen'</p>

<p>President Trump refused to say during Tuesday night's presidential debate if he would accept the election results.</p>

<p>'This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen,' he said of the November vote, citing mail-in ballots.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly claimed mail-in ballots will lead to a 'rigged' election despite numerous studies showing that is the case.</p>

<p>'If I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that,' Trump said as many states have begun mailing out their general election ballots.</p>

<p>Joe Biden said the results of the election would be accepted by both sides.</p>

<p>'He has no idea what he's talking about,' Biden said. 'Here's the deal. The fact is I will accept it. And he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that will be the end of it. That will be the end of it. And if it's me, fine. If it's not me, I will support the outcome.'</p>

<p>He defended mail-in voting.</p>

<p>'It's not been established at all that there is a fraud related to mail-in ballots - that somehow it's a fraudulent process,' he said.</p>

<p>'He's trying to scare people into thinking it's not going to be legitimate,' he said of Trump.</p>

<p>The president said his supporters would be watching for possible voter fraud.</p>

<p>'I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully,' he said.</p>

<p>President Trump refused to say during Tuesday night's presidential debate if he would accept the election results. 'This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen,' he said of the November vote, citing mail-in ballots</p>

<p>Petty spats over who is smarter</p>

<p>The two men bickered about their intelligence. Trump has called himself a 'very stable genius' and bragged about how well he's done on a cognitive test, challenging Biden to take one.</p>

<p>And when Biden said he need to get 'a lot smarter' or more people would die from COVID, Trump was quick to pounce.</p>

<p>'Did you use the word 'Smart?' He said he went to Delaware State,' he snapped of Biden. Trump went to the University of Pennsylvania. 'He graduated the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word 'Smart' with me.'</p>

<p>Biden hit back.</p>

<p>'Oh, give me a break,' he said.</p>

<p>Trump replied: 'There's nothing smart about you. 47 years, you've done nothing.' </p>

<p>When Trump was pressed to reveal his health plan, he spoke about a Supreme Court ruling that struck down Obamacare's mandate that people buy insurance: 'Excuse me – I got rid of the individual mandate,' Trump said.</p>

<p>Wallace told him it was not a plan. 'That is absolutely a big thing,' Trump responded.</p>

<p>When Trump and Biden kept going at it, Wallace implored: 'Mr. President I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question.'</p>

<p>Biden was determined not to be caught with only a knife in a gunfight.</p>

<p>'You picked the wrong guy at the wrong night at the wrong time,' he told Trump.</p>

<p>Trump accused him of risking left wing wrath by distancing himself from Sanders.</p>

<p>'You just lost the left,' Trump told him.</p>

<p>The angry attacks carried over into the coronavirus.</p>

<p>'And by the way maybe inject some bleach into your arm, that'll take care of it,' Biden said, mocking Trump's comments about injecting disinfectant to cure the virus.</p>

<p>Trump said is was said 'sarcastically' – a claim he did not make at the time.</p>

<p>The two men bickered about their intelligence. Trump has called himself a 'very stable genius' and bragged about how well he's done on a cognitive test, challenging Biden to take one</p>

<p>The city of Cleveland set up barriers and called in the National Guard in anticipation of protests and riots ahead of the first presidential debate Tuesday evening. </p>

<p>Cleveland has been preparing for the first presidential clash of 2020. There will be two more debates - in Nashville and Miami - and a vice presidential debate in Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>Protesters swarmed the area around the debate hall with police on hand in case things got out of line. </p>

<p>The signs were varied: Black Lives Matter, the more than 200,000 deaths from COVID in the United States and for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. </p>

<p>The secret service, the lead agency for security at the event, set up a perimeter around the Samson Pavilion, the building where the debate will be held. There are numerous road closures in place.</p>

<p>Mayor Jackson said: 'Cleveland has been a peaceful city lately so let's keep it that way and show the people the way Cleveland is.' Lt. Col. Audrey Fielding of the Ohio National Guard added: 'Members of this task force are specifically trained and equipped and prepared to support law enforcement in protection tasks.'</p>

<p>Military trucks have arrived on the scene Monday and images show there is a heavy police presence on the Cleveland Clinic campus where the two candidates will meet. Overhead on Monday a small plane circled the area with a 'Black Lives Matter' sign.</p>

<p>Public Safety Director Karrie Howard said: 'I assure the citizens of Cleveland that we have taken every precaution to make sure that while people exercise their First Amendment right to free speech, it will be done in a safe and secure manner.'</p>

<p>Police are said to be on 12-hour shifts with days off canceled.</p>

<p>Trump was supported in Cleveland by first lady Melania Trump, who wore a $3340 Dolce &amp; Gabbana black pinstriped pantsuit.</p>

<p>President Trump had all his adult children and several of their significant others with him when he landed in Cleveland, including Ivanka Trump, Lara Trump, Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Kimberly Guilfoyle.</p>

<p>On the staff side, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Rep. Jim Jordan and adviser Hope Hicks also accompanied the Trumps on Air Force One.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Melania Trump and Jill Biden came face-to-face for the first time this election year at the debate.</p>

<p>The two women have been at the same events in the past, including Trump's 2017 inauguration and the December 2018 funeral for George H.W. Bush, where the Bidens sat a row behind the Trumps.</p>

<p>But Tuesday marks the first election meeting for the two women, who have taken different approaches to the campaign trail this year. </p>

<p>Biden, who has years of experience as a political spouse, has been an active campaigner for her husband, keeping her own travel schedule, conducting interviews, and making the case for his election. She and Joe Biden will launch a train tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania on Wednesday. </p>

<p>Melania Trump, who was a political neophyte in the 2016 campaign, made the case for her husband's re-election bid at the Republican National Convention in August but hasn't appeared at a campaign event for him since then.  </p>

<p>The 90-minute debate was divided into six segments, selected by Fox News' Chris Wallace, who moderated.  They included: the pandemic, the economy, the Supreme Court, election integrity, the candidates' records, and 'race and violence in our cities.' </p>

<p>The candidates did not shake hands when they take the stage at 9 pm ET on Tuesday night because of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead they stood at podiums that are socially distanced from one another while Wallace sits at a desk in front of them.</p>

<p>There was no opening statements and the first question went to Trump. </p>

<p>There was be a 'small' audience in the room, all of whom were tested for COVID, according to Peter Ayre, senior adviser to the Commission on Presidential Debates. </p>

<p>Chairs are lined up but signs have been placed on two of every three chairs that read: 'Thank you for not sitting here in observance of social distancing.'</p>

<p>Each campaign was given 20 tickets to hand out to guests. There will be about 100 people total watching. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson urged protesters to remain peaceful but said he will not issue a curfew for the city as protests and riots were feared. </p>

<p>'Cleveland has been a peaceful city lately so let's keep it that way and show the people the way Cleveland is,' Jackson said.  </p>

<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine sent 300 members from the Ohio National Guard to Cleveland. </p>

<p>A security perimeter was set up around the Samson Pavilion, the building where the debate will be held. There are numerous road closures in place for the debate sponsored by Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. </p>

<p>Polls show Biden leading Trump nationally and in a number of key battleground states ahead of the debate, which is their first face-to-face meeting this year.</p>

<p>'I am looking very forward to the debate,' Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. </p>

<p>It is the first of three scheduled presidential debates. Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate, will debate in October. </p>

<p>Trump suggested in a tweet on Sunday that Biden will be on performance-enhancing drugs during the debate, which could be a prediction of how he'll try and rattle Biden during their face off.</p>

<p>Protesters rally against President Trump at the debate</p>

<p>Biden and his aides had rehearsed for any possible attacks from the commander-in-chief and the Democratic nominee has said he hopes he won't get thrown off by any Trump allegations.  </p>

<p>The president has insisted repeatedly - and without proof - that Biden took performance enhancement drugs ahead of the Democratic debates. He's challenged him to take a drug test ahead of their debate here while offering to take one himself.</p>

<p>'Joe Biden just announced that he will not agree to a Drug Test. Gee, I wonder why?,' Trump tweeted Monday morning.</p>

<p>And the president said during a press conference at the White House on Sunday that he wasn't joking.</p>

<p>'No, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm willing to take a drug test. I think he should too,' he said. </p>

<p>On Sunday, when asked by reporters if he would take a drug test, Biden replied:  'No, I have no comment.</p>

<p>And his campaign put out a statement saying if Trump 'thinks his best case is made in urine, he can have it.'   </p>

<p>Joe Biden released his tax returns on Tuesday ahead of the debate in a move seen as a troll to President Donald Trump</p>

<p>The Samson Pavilion on the main campus of the Cleveland Clinic, where the debate takes place</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: How you doing, man?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: How are you doing?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm well.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. The only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, Joe.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that's on the court, and if it's struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: There aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He's elected to the next election.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years. I'm elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they're very happy this.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That's simply not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, you're certainly going to socialist. You're going to socialist-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, we're now into open discussion.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Open discussion.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is simply a lie.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Your party doesn't say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And they're going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I am the Democratic Party right now.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Not according to Harris.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here's the deal. The deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there's seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Joe, you've had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don't tell me about this.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm happy to talk about this.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn't want me to ban Europe.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, gentlemen, Mr. President.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You would have been much later, Joe, much later.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: We're talking about two million people.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: You're not going to be able to shut him up.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That's on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that's also at stake right now. And so the election is all-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You don't know what's on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It's not on the ballot.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: It's on the ballot in the court.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: In the court.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: There's nothing happening there.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You don't know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don't know here view.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Well, all right. All right. Let's talk. We've got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We've got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we'll come back to Roe V. Wade.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: All right.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's right.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You have spent the last week-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Because they want to give good healthcare.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: If I may ask my question, sir.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Good healthcare.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: [crosstalk] when I finish I'm going to give an opportunity-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: That's not a comprehensive place.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I didn't ask, sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You're debating him not me. Let me ask my question.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I got rid of it. And we will protect people.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's okay. I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody's done it. So we're cutting healthcare.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: What about pre-existing conditions?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: All of the things that we've done.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He has not done healthcare.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing. Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: This is big stuff.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yes.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: It is not.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: If I start asking the question.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's not what your party says, by the way.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: It does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who's far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Look, hey.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Are you saying you didn't agree?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Not by much.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Not by much.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm here standing facing you, old buddy.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: All he knows how to do-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Look he's the deal. I got very lucky. I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: With what?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And tonight I'm going to make sure.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: With what?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Because here's the deal, here's the deal. The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he's a liar.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: But you agree. Joe, you're the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: God, I want to make sure-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: No, he doesn't know how to do that.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You'd be surprised. You'd be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: There is no manifesto, number one.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Please let him speak, Mr. President.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Number two.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He just lost the left.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Number two.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk], they call it socialized medicine.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Who is, Bernie?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won't ever look you in the eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He doesn't know how. He doesn't know how to do that.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I've already fixed it.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He has never offered a plan.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: We've already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don't, Obamacare is no good.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, you realize if you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn't even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, 'You've got to run it so well.' And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Please let the Vice President talk, sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Good.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He has no plan for healthcare.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Of course, we do.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Please.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He's been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about. [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, I have one final question for you.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Sure.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn't brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Whatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You're voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Are you going to pack the court?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Vote now.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Are you going to pack the court?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He doesn't want to answer the question.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm not going to answer the question.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Why wouldn't you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who's on your list?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, I think we've ended this-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: This is so un-Presidential.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He's going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: We have ended the segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That was really a productive segment, wasn't it? Keep yapping, man.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: The people understand, Joe.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: They sure do.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: 47 years, you've done nothing. They're understand.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, 'It is what it is.' Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That's why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Wrong.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Wrong.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir, it's his two minutes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It's so wrong.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: So, if we would have listened to you.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: If we would've listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China. You don't know how many people died in Russia. You don't know how many people died in India. They don't exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said, 'He's xenophobic. He's a racist and he's xenophobic,' because you didn't think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir, it's his two minutes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, 'President Trump saved thousands of lives.' Many of your Democrat Governors said, 'President Trump did a phenomenal job.' We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, 'President Trump did a phenomenal job.' We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could've never done that, Joe.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, you didn't do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: 14,000 people died, not 200,000.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: A far less lethal disease, by the way.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And there was no one … We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it's shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You're months behind me, Joe.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we're for a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You don't trust Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer?</p>

<p>Part 2</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, I've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: God.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It is a very political thing. I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It's become very political because the left… Or I don't know if I call them left, I don't know what I call them.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: So you're suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: He talked about the summer, sir, before it's generally available, just like Dr. Redfield.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Because he said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I'm talking about when it's generally available, not-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They're going to be delivering-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: This is the same man who told you-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It's all set up.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: … by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it'd be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: So here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You'll have the vaccine sooner than that.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, 'Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.' Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But you're saying you can't-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Everybody knows-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Or Senator Harris is saying you can't trust the scientist.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn't say that. You can trust the-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: She said that public health experts quote, 'Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.'</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yes. Well, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend on him. They're the people… And by the way-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: By the way-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … they will have the vaccine very soon.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Let him finish.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Do you believe for a moment what he's telling you in light of all the lies he's told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me. Don't ever use that word.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Oh, give me a break.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Because you know what? There's nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you've done nothing.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, let's have this debate-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it's being built again and it's going up fast.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: We'll get to the economy in the next segment, sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Okay. It's going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Because he doesn't have a plan. If I were running it, I'd know what the plan is. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Will he just shush for a minute?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk] Chuck.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won't even meet with them. The Republicans won't meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You probably play more than I do, Joe.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: What about this question of reopenings and the fact-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: You just admitted you'd shut it down.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now we've found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right. I want to move onto another-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Because it's a political thing.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I want to move onto another subject.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I got to respond to that.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I want to move-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: But those states-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I got to respond to that.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He wants to shut down the whole country.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody's had a test and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Just like your rally.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … when needed. When needed, I wear masks.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay. Let me ask-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I don't wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen. I will say this-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But I was asking you, sir, about masks.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And they've also said the opposite. They've also said-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay. I want to ask you-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He did not say the opposite.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I want to ask you, we've got a little than a minute left in this segment.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He said very strongly, 'Masks are not good.' Then he changed his mind. He said, 'Masks are good.'</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I want to ask-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'm okay with masks. I'm not fighting masks.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you're holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Outside.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Because nobody will show up.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … people with masks.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's true. Nobody shows up to his rallies.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But are not worried about us spreading disease?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … I'm doing my job as a president, and I'll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It's outside. That's a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, 'No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I'm way far away from those other people.' That's what he said, 'I'm going to be okay.' He's not worried about you. He's not worried about the people out there [crosstalk].</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: We've had no negative effect.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: No negative effect. Come on.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: We've had no negative effect, and we've had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yes, I would. He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He's a fool on this.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can't. Nobody cares.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, can we move on to the-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: No cares.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Yes.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: The economy is, I think it's fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Much faster.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it's more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we're reopening and we're doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what's happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, 'Oh, we're going to open up on November 9th.' Why November 9th? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost it's like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very, very sad thing. And he'll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don't need somebody to come in and say, 'Let's shut it down.'</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right. Your two minutes, sir. We're now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it's a V-shape recovery, you say it's a K-shaped recovery. What's the difference?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's wrong.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir, wait. No. Sir-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Yeah, I understand. You've agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who've been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Schools. Why aren't schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn't do that because it's not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They've done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They're closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I have to respond to that.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Well, you both had two minutes, sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, he made a statement.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: And so did you.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: No, people want their schools open. They don't want to be shut down. They don't want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It's so sad what's happening in New York. It's almost like a ghost town, and I'm not sure it can ever recover what they've done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: People want to be safe.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: They'll be careful, but they want their schools open.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: People want to be safe.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'm the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I'm very happy to do it-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right. Let's-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, we're going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there's a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I'm asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Show us your tax returns.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There's 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I'm totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir, I'm asking you a specific question, which is-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: But let me tell you-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I understand all of that.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Release your tax return.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I understand all of that-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Let me-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No, Mr. President, I'm asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You paid millions of dollars in-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars, yes.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: So not 750?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Millions of dollars. And you'll get to see it. And you'll get to see it.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: When?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: But let me just tell you-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: In [crosstalk]?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don't want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they're stupid, they go through the laws, and that's what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that's-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Vice President Biden, you want to respond?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That's why I'm going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I'm going to eliminate those tax cuts.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's okay.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: But why didn't you do it over the last 25 years?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Because you weren't president-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Why didn't you do it over the last 25 years?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Because you weren't president and screwing things up.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You were a Senator and [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: You're the worst president America has ever had. Come on.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years, Joe. We've done things that you never even thought of doing.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay. Gentlemen?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, we're talking about the economy. I'd like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He has none.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it's just coming out of a recession.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But respectfully, sir, I'm talking about taxes, not spending.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: By the way, I'm going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I'm going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn't be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Why didn't you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I got it done. And you know what happened?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yeah, you got it done-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Our economy boomed like it's never boomed before.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The economy-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Let me finish.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Not lower tax for the American people.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But let me-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama's final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I'll tell you what, you'll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they'll leave for other places. [crosstalk] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Look-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. Vice President.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you're talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It wasn't blooming.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He blew it.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: When COVID came along.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, wait.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: … number one. Number two-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Chris.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Number three.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: They said it would take… No, you're on number two.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: No.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Chris, Chris. They said it would take-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: This guy-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: We did not. [crosstalk]</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … standard fare.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm the guy that brought back the automobile industry.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He totally gave up on manufacturing.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, let him-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They're gone. He blew it. And in fact, they're gone-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Ohio had the best year it's ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they've ever had.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn't come in with you. [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, go ahead.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And so you take a look at what he's actually done. He's done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China's perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch- [crosstalk].</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: … with Mexico.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we're at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow's wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … to deserve $183,000?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir, you've asked him a question, let him answer it.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Oh really, he didn't get three and a half million?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Is totally-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, please. You've asked a question- [crosstalk]</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well wait, he didn't get three and a half million dollars, Joe?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Mr. Vice-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … dollars.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, it's an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk]</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It's a fact.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: It is not a fact.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: It's been totally discredited.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: My son did nothing wrong at Barisma-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I think he did.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, let him answer. [crosstalk].</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He doesn't want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: By who?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And you can-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: The media.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: By the World Bank-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … because they're embarrassed.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: By everyone, has discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk] Matter of fact-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, please stop.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Even the people who testified under oath-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Go ahead, I'm listening to you.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Even the people under-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: … testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I did it honorably.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'd like to know who they are.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, I'll give you the list of the people who-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'll fire them.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No, no. Go ahead, sir.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm sure that you've already fired most of them, because they did a good job.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Some people don't do a good job.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, here's the- [crosstalk]</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Go ahead. You get the- [crosstalk] Wait a minute. You get the final word, Mr.-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, it's hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Hey, let me just tell you, Joe-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: No, no. Mr. President- [crosstalk]</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Three and a half million, Joe.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is simply not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Look, here's the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don't want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family's already-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: My family-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No, no- [crosstalk].</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And that's such a- [crosstalk]</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Every single one of them lost a fortune-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: This is not about my family or his family. It's about your family, the American people. [crosstalk] That's not true. It doesn't want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it's about you. That's what we're talking about here. [crosstalk]</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: That's the end of the segment. We're moving on.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He didn't take that.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Vice President-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Chris, can I be honest? It's a very important question-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Try to be honest.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He stood up-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: The answer to the question is no.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … and the threatened Ukraine-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … with a billion dollars-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is absolutely not true.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Stop. [crosstalk] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here's the deal.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That's a good point.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We're going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I'm going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, and him too.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Well, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting than he has.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's all right, but he does plenty.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Well, sir, less than-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He does plenty.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No, less than you have. Let's please continue on. The issue of rice. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Oh yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's true.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: It's about equity and equality. It's about decency. It's about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, 'There were very fine people on both sides.' No president's ever said anything like that. [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: It is his-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Now-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … minute sir.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: … second point I'd make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man's done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: So-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I've never said-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No, no, sir. It's his two minutes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: So you did that and they call you a super predator and I'm letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, 'I support President Trump.'</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it, because they're run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don't. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, 'Whether justice could be equally applied in America.' Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yes, there is. There's systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we're going to work this out.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: We're going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, Mr.-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: President Trump-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk].</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not peaceful protest.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: No it's not, but you say it is.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: President Trump, I'd like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we're going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Fine.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I ended it because it's racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it- [crosstalk]</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: What is radical about racial sensitivity training?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It's a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to allow that to happen.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Vice President Biden.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Nobody's doing that. He's the racist.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You just don't know.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Here's the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Let him finish.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important people know. Many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I'm even seeing now.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Oh my Lord.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: But the reason-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: This is ridiculous.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … is that the Democrats that run these cities-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … don't want to talk, like you, about law and order.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Violent crime-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And you still haven't mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You- [crosstalk].</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk]</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk] Let him answer.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Okay.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It's gone up on his watch.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It went down much more in ours.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, we're done- [crosstalk] Mr. President, you're going to be very happy because we're now going to talk about law and order.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: The places we had trouble were democratic run cities-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: That's exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a…</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: It's like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it's going up, like nobody's ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what's going on and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't because he'll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it's over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you've never seen before.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He wouldn't know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I know suburbs so much that you.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen wait a minute.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They're dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they're being flooded, they're being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That's why the suburbs are in trouble.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support? If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I'm totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down, it didn't go up. It went down. And so we have to be…</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's not what they are talking about this. That's not what it is about. He's talking about defunding the police.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He doesn't have any law support. He has no law enforcement.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That's not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: We don't have time to do anything.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Now, gentleman. I think I'm going to tell I'm going to take back the bottom line.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: There aren't any.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, 'Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you'd stop the days and months of violence in Portland.'</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I don't hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I've made it clear. I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But you've never called for the people…</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He's never done that.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn't do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Go ahead sir.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And by the way his own former spokesperson said, 'Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.' That's what this is all about.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I don't know who said that.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I do.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Who?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I think Kellyanne Conway.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I don't think she said that.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: She said that.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Here's the point, the point is that that's why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, 'Let's get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.' What's he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay. And to end this, button up this segment I'm going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly criticized…</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Does it mean I have to answer his stuff.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You have repeatedly…</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Wait a second, you have made a statement.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You've been talking back and forth. I'm asking you.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I would love to end it.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That'd be no problem. But I don't want to accept the National Guard.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Sure, I'm willing to do that.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Are you prepared specifically to do it.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But what are you saying?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Well, do it, sir.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Say it, do it say it.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: White supremacist and white militia.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Okay, boys stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He's own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Oh you got to be kidding me.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: … not a militia. That's what his FBI Director said.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, then you know what, he's wrong.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: We're done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk]</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Antifa is bad.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Every body in your administration tells you the true, it's a bad idea. You have no idea about anything.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, gentlemen we're now moving onto the Trump-Biden record.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And you ought to be careful of them, they'll over throw you.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I'm going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you'd like to quote one of your dad's sayings, which is don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I'm going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you'll go first, two minutes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years. And that's despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that's done what I've done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it's time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we're building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn't have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military. And I'll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I'll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I'll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like, you just don't do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say, if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president. You can't be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It's a record.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I've gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. He's Putin's puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You son got three and a half million dollars.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: By the way, my son…</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, you're a side agreed to it and why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He never keeps his word.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No, that was a rhetorical question.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Can you get back 30 seconds?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Yes. You may have, go ahead.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: So thirdly, we're poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you're in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He's President United States. It's on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can't stay divided. We can't be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Really?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And I resent-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm talking about my son, Beau Biden, you're talking about Hunter?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I don't know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That's not true he was not dishonorably discharged.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: For cocaine use. And he didn't have a job until you became vice president.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: None of that is true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He made a fortune and he didn't have a job.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He's overtaking it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him, I'm proud of my son.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He wasn't given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk] It was all discredited.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: We've already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I'm going to make a judgment call here.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not true. That report is totally discredited.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Why did he get it?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayer's money. That report was written for political reason.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I'd like to talk about climate change.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: So would I.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don't think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren't put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what's going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they're like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You've got to have forest management.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good. We're planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it's very exciting for a lot of people.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California's burning, California's burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they're forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it's a forest city. He said, 'Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn't be that problem.' I spoke with the Governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor. But I said, 'At some point you can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.' That's burning down because of a lack of management.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But in the case of California they have simply ignored that.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we're going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars. I've given big incentives for electric cars but what they've done in California is just crazy.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, Vice president Biden. I'd like you to respond to the president's climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody's going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one's going to build another oil fire plant in America. They're going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things that we can do…</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, 'Here's $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences.'</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: What about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he's drawn his line.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Well, he hasn't drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane's not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Not true. Not true-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: It's all true. And here's the deal-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He's talking about the Green New Deal. And it's not 2 billion [crosstalk] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk]. It's $100 trillion.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I'm talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Let him go for a minute, and then you can go.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And rebuild the building.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: No.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It's the dumbest-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … most ridiculous [crosstalk] where two car systems are out-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Not true-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … where they want to take out the cows too.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's not true either, right?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Not true.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: This is a 100 trillion-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Simply… Look-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: That's more money than our country could make in 100 years [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is simply not the case-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right. Let me [crosstalk]. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president is saying, I think some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: What it's going to do, it's going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Let him finish, sir.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He doesn't know how to do that-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: 100 million dollars.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The fact is, it's going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It's going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I never said that at all-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yeah, he did say that-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: They made it up.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: And here's the deal-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You make up a lot-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: … we're going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We're in real trouble. Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before. They're because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world's problem. But the rest of the world, we've got to get them to come along. That's why we have to get back into the Paris Accord.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, gentlemen-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn't he do it for 47 years? You were vice president-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: For 47-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: So why didn't you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We're supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: That is not my plan [crosstalk]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk] is not my plan. [crosstalk]</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay. [crosstalk] Mr. Vice President-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He called the military stupid bastards.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I did not say that-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He said it on tape. [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Please, sir. [crosstalk] Stop.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I would never say that [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Play it. Play it-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Stop. Go ahead-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You're on tape-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. Vice President answered his final question.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The final question is, I can't remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk].</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I'm having a little trouble myself, but…</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: And about the economy and about this question of what it's going to cost.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The economy-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We're not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: So, do you support the Green New Deal?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Pardon me?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Do you support the-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: No, I don't support the Green New Deal.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Oh, you don't? Oh, well, that's a big statement.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I support [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You just lost the radical left.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I support [crosstalk] the Biden plan that I put forward.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote, and what means by which they're going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they're all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that'll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he's not sure what he's going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter, because if we get the votes, it's going to be all over. He's going to go. He can't stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. President, two minutes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: He knew about it too. So don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You're soliciting. You're asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice. On November 3rd, you're watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we're going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: But you know what? We won't know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They're losing 30 and 40%. It's a fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, 'You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.' November 10th. That's seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states [crosstalk] with that-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Sir.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … all run by Democrats-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Two minutes is two minutes.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: All run by Democrats.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: President Trump-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It's a rigged election.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You're going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it's rigged [crosstalk], that it's going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. I think I'm counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don't need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what's happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don't like them. We don't like them. They throw them out-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: But what are you going to do about it-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … left and right.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: There are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that's okay-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No. No. I know your complaint [crosstalk]. I'm asking you about the fact that millions of people have received-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You go and vote. You go and vote-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No. But what I'm saying is [crosstalk], what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in, they're sending it back and you're sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what's going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: There is no [crosstalk]… There is no evidence of that-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: This is not going to end well.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: There is no evidence of that-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: This is not going to end well-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Okay. Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don't have to solicit the ballot. It's sent to you. It's sent to your home. What they're saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He's just afraid of counting the votes-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You're wrong. You're wrong [crosstalk]. I love counting the votes [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I want to continue with you on this [crosstalk] Vice President Biden-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Chris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here's the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that's you before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it's you. That is totally legitimate.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: All right.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: No. No. No. I have a final [crosstalk]. Gentlemen, I have a final question [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You know it can't be done. You know it can't, and already, there's been fraud [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Mail service delivers [crosstalk] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk]-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: We can keep talking. In eight states, [crosstalk] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it's likely, because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: Could be months-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … until we find out who the new president is. First for you, sir. Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'm urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They're called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it's going to be a fair election. If it's a fair election-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You're urging them what?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that. And I'll tell you why-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: What does that mean, not go along-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: … from a common sense-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Does that mean you're going to tell your people-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you what it means-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … to take to the streets?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It means you have a fraudulent election. You're sending out 80 million ballots-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: And what would you do about that?</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: They're not equipped… These people aren't equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Vice President Biden-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: You think that's good?</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Vice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: Yes. And here's the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it's going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military… They've been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that's what's going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it's a fraudulent process.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: It's already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney's race-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk]. Go ahead [crosstalk]. Vice President Biden, go ahead.</p>

<p>JOE BIDEN: He has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. That'll be the end of it. And if it's me, in fact, fine. If it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I'll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I want to see an honest ballot cut-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, just say that's the end of it [crosstalk]. This is the end of this debate-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: I want to see an honest ballot count.</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: We're going to leave it there-</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP: And I think he does too-</p>

<p>CHRIS WALLACE: … to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it's been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night. Thank you. </p>
