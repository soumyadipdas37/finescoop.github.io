        <p>Denise Richards denied being friends with Brandi Glanville despite evidence to the contrary on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reunion.</p>

<p>On the second hour of the show, which aired Wednesday, Denise, 49, was forced to answer questions about their relationship.</p>

<p>She swore that they had never been intimate, and were merely on an 'acquaintance' level.</p>

<p>Friendship denial: Denise Richards denied being friends with Brandi Glanville despite evidence to the contrary on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reunion</p>

<p>'Every 10 text messages that were sent to me from Brandi, I would respond,' Denise insisted. 'She would always contact me wanting to go to dinner and this and that, and I never did.'</p>

<p>The Bold and the Beautiful star had consistently denied the rumor that she'd had sex with Brandi, 47, but said she'd been nice to her because she had no reason not to be.</p>

<p>'Why didn't you just call Brandi in Rome and say, ''What the f*** are you doing?'',' Lisa Rinna, 57, asked her about the week the rumors spread.</p>

<p>'Because she's not a friend of mine, Lisa. She's not,' Denise declared.</p>

<p>Acquaintance level: The 49-year-old actress swore that she and Brandi had never been intimate, and were merely on an 'acquaintance' level</p>

<p>Good question: Why didn't you just call Brandi in Rome and say, ''What the f*** are you doing?'',' Lisa Rinna, 57, asked her about the week the rumors spread</p>

<p>Reunion host Andy Cohen, 52, pointed out that Denise had called Brandi 'a good friend' at a 2019 BravoCon event.</p>

<p>Denise reiterated that she meant it, and had no reason to say otherwise.</p>

<p>'Look, I feel like you're trying to discredit this, and that's not cool, because I've done a lot of stuff,' she told Andy. 'I've never socialized with this person in my entire life.'</p>

<p>The host: Reunion host Andy Cohen, 52, pointed out that Denise had called Brandi 'a good friend' at a 2019 BravoCon event</p>

<p>'Well, where is Brandi?' asked Erika Girardi, 49, as Denise asked that question herself.</p>

<p>'Hold on, you know what? This is bulls***,' Lisa said. 'Why isn't Brandi here to do this with you?'</p>

<p>'Lisa, why would this even be about me and Brandi?' Denise asked. 'She's not part of our show.'</p>

<p>Noticeably absent: 'Well, where is Brandi?' asked Erika Girardi, 49, as Denise asked that question herself</p>

<p>After a pause, she added, 'I was not gonna give her the satisfaction to come on.'</p>

<p>That led Erika to ask Denise if she'd kept Brandi from attending the reunion, to which Denise would only say, 'I owe her nothing. She's not a friend of mine.'</p>

<p>Andy interrupted them to explain the real reason for Brandi's absence.</p>

<p>Rel reason: Andy explained why Brandi was not joining them on the reunion</p>

<p>'I would like to add that the conversation at Bravo was that after saying, ''I licked her c***,'' there really was nowhere else to go,' he shared. 'We've kind of heard enough, and what more can we add to this conversation?'</p>

<p>'You guys don't know the stuff she has sent me, and it is so inappropriate, and it's harassment,' Denise volunteered.</p>

<p>She'd already noted on air that Brandi said she'd slept with some of the RHOBH cast, but wouldn't name names.</p>

<p>Not appropriate: 'You guys don't know the stuff she has sent me, and it is so inappropriate, and it's harassment,' Denise volunteered</p>

<p>Kyle Richards, 51, offered to get Brandi on the phone and ask her point-blank if they'd had sex.</p>

<p>'Raise your hand if you slept with Brandi Glanville!' she cracked.</p>

<p>Andy tentatively raised his hand, making everyone laugh.</p>

<p>Funny line: 'Raise your hand if you slept with Brandi Glanville!' Kyle Richards cracked</p>

<p>He asked Denise why she didn't just say who Brandi allegedly slept with.</p>

<p>'It wasn't just one person,' Denise revealed. 'There's one in this group, and there's a couple people outside of the group that you all know.'</p>

<p>Despite the cast egging her on to say who it was, Denise refused, adding, 'I don't give a rat's a** who it is. It has nothing to do with me. I don't care what people think.'</p>

<p>Staying silent: Denise refused to spill sex secrets despite everyone's urging</p>

<p>She also addressed the horrible things that Brandi claimed she'd said about the cast, telling Erika she was 'condescending,' not 'cold,' and calling Teddi Mellencamp-Arroyave, 39, a 's***-stirrer,' and nothing else.</p>

<p>Denise shared that she no longer liked Teddi, and Teddi asked her about a comment she'd made in which she confessed to having said 'way worse things' about her.</p>

<p>The Starship Troopers star was then shown in flashback making that comment in a confessional.</p>

<p>Not friends: The Starship Troopers star shared that she no longer liked Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave and Teddi asked her about a comment she'd made in which she confessed to having said 'way worse things' about her</p>

<p>'According to who, Brandi?' Denise sneered, not seeing the footage.</p>

<p>'You!' her castmates chorused.</p>

<p>'You guys are so vicious,' Denise complained.</p>

<p>Mean girls: 'You guys are so vicious,' Denise complained</p>

<p>'I feel that the cover up is worse than the crime,' Lisa said.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the show, Kyle was the one in the hot seat, as Andy asked her why she'd called the cast 'fake-a** b****es,' and blindly defended Teddi no matter what.</p>

<p>'I don't know why you cannot acknowledge that your friendship with Teddi is different than your friendship with the other women in the group,' said Dorit Kemsley, 44.</p>

<p>Hot seat: At the beginning of the show, Kyle was the one in the hot seat, as Andy asked her why she'd called the cast 'fake-a** b****es,' and blindly defended Teddi no matter what</p>

<p>'Of course, I acknowledge that,' Kyle replied. 'Teddi is a better friend to me, okay? I acknowledge that… I am closest with Teddi. We have more in common.'</p>

<p>'I'm so glad you're admitting that!' Dorit enthused, as Garcelle Beauvais, 53, applauded.</p>

<p>'You're putting me up against the wall like it was a crime to have a good friend,' Kyle continued. '[I'm] acknowledging that she's slept in my bed on a trip to Europe, which, I've done that with my sisters and my friends my whole life. That's not weird.'</p>

<p>About time: Garcelle Beauvais, 53, applauded as Kyle finally admitted that she favored Teddi</p>

<p>Erika admitted that sometimes it hurt when Kyle lashed out at her while drunk, especially when she'd suggested at an astrology party that Erika had no friends.</p>

<p>Dorit asked Kyle what she'd meant when she said that day that Erika wasn't really her friend.</p>

<p>'I've apologized,' Kyle moaned. 'We don't need to beat it to death. You've been coming for me all season, Dorit! You wanted to take credit for my fashion show, you wanted to take credit for me hiring Wilson Phillips for my charity gala. You've come for me all season!'</p>

<p>Friendship questions: Dorit Kemsley asked Kyle what she'd meant when she said that day that Erika wasn't really her friend</p>

<p>Kyle noted that Dorit insulted her fashion business in the press, to which Dorit said that she'd just poked fun at her for not being as prepared with her line as she should have been.</p>

<p>'It's hurt me a lot that from the first episode, you've just blanked me,' Dorit returned. 'You and I have never had a relationship where we don't speak for months and months on end.'</p>

<p>Andy asked Kyle if she and Dorit were speaking, and Kyle slowly shook her head.</p>

<p>Not talking: Andy asked Kyle if she and Dorit were speaking, and Kyle slowly shook her head</p>

<p>'I mean this from the bottom of my heart,' Dorit told her. 'I never meant to slam your business. I wish you all the success in the world, and if you ever, ever, ever need anything in the world, I am always here. In a heartbeat.'</p>

<p>Kyle accepted the apology, and told the women her 'fake-a** b****es' comment was something she said while feeling like she was under attack.</p>

<p>She noted that it wasn't pointed at Denise, whom she had also called a 'ragamuffin.'</p>

<p>Apology accepted: Kyle accepted the apology, and told the women her 'fake-a** b****es' comment was something she said while feeling like she was under attack</p>

<p>Denise said that when she heard the latter comment, she 'didn't care,' and instead wondered if she could trademark the term for a line of clothing.</p>

<p>Lisa was the next topic of conversation, and Andy asked her if she thought her sexy dancing on Instagram contributed to her daughter Amelia Gray Hamlin's eating disorder.</p>

<p>'Of course, as a mother, your actions — you're always looking at that,' Lisa affirmed, as Garcelle, who'd already asked the same question, called Lisa 'an incredible mother.'</p>

<p>Sexy dancing: Lisa was the next topic of conversation, and Andy asked her if she thought her sexy dancing on Instagram contributed to her daughter Amelia Gray Hamlin's eating disorder</p>

<p>Lisa swore that if her daughters had asked her to stop dancing, she would have.</p>

<p>She revealed that Amelia, 19, paid for the $5,700 monthly rent on her new apartment with money from modeling, but conceded there were days where she didn't do so well.</p>

<p>'This is a struggle that she will have her whole entire life, and we will do what we have to do to help her in every single moment,' Lisa emphasized.</p>

<p>Together again: The women gathered virtually amid the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Asked whether she'd drawn attention to herself during her daughters' photo shoot for their apparel line, Lisa said, 'Of course I'm gonna draw attention 'cause it's f***ing me!'</p>

<p>Andy raved about a naked photo that Lisa recently posted online, to which the actress replied, 'Obviously I f<strong><em>ing love attention, and I f</em></strong>ing love to push the boundaries. Is that such a hard thing to figure out? I mean, hello!'</p>

<p>She even admitted that her daughters had learned how to perform oral sex after one of their friends read her book, and told them about it.</p>

<p>Teddi was the next one in the spotlight, and was asked to explain the provenance of her baby daughter Dove's name.</p>

<p>Baby name: Teddi was the next one in the spotlight, and was asked to explain the provenance of her baby daughter Dove's name</p>

<p>She said she'd always liked the moniker, but was only able to convince her husband to use it by telling him their daughter would have her own emoji.</p>

<p>Her other daughter Slate, seven, had been in a horrible accident recently, where the tip of her finger was amputated after being caught in a wind-slammed door.</p>

<p>Teddi put the fingertip on ice before hearing from 911 that it needed to be in gauze.</p>

<p>She quickly called her RHOBH pals and got an immediate appointment with plastic surgeon Paul Nassif, the ex of RHOBH star Adrienne Maloof.</p>

<p>Tenth season: Andy gathered the women to discuss season 10 of the Bravo show</p>

<p>'The surgery was incredible,' Teddi remembered, adding that the scar wasn't even visible.</p>

<p>Before the show ended, Andy told the women that he had the infamous bunny Lisa gave to Kim Richards, 55, for her grandchild on the shelf of his Hamptons home.</p>

<p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Reunion part three will air next week on Bravo.</p>

<p>Hamptons home: Before the show ended, Andy told the women that he had the infamous bunny Lisa gave to Kim Richards, 55, for her grandchild on the shelf of his Hamptons home</p>
