    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>We're into the final few days of the summer transfer window now and for those Premier League clubs who desperately need reinforcements, it's time to start making moves happen.</p>

<p>The opening three rounds of the season have certainly exposed plenty of deficiencies and no club can afford to leave the repair work until January. </p>

<p>Sportsmail takes a look at each of the 20 top-flight teams, who they need to keep their season on track and who they're likely to get. </p>

<p>Contributions by Adrian Kajumba, Sami Mokbel, Jack Gaughan, Craig Hope and Dominic King.</p>

<p>ARSENAL</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Summer reinforcements so far have come largely in defence, with Willian the exception so far.</p>

<p>However, the Gunners remain in the market for a central midfielder, especially with Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi potentially on their way out of the club. </p>

<p>There's optimism at Arsenal they will get someone in before the window shuts. </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>It's no secret that Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey and Lyon's Houssem Aouar are Arsenal's main targets in the midfield position. </p>

<p>Reports suggest Arsenal have all but given up on hopes of signing Partey and are concentrating on Aouar, whom Lyon value at £54m.</p>

<p>The French club's president Jean-Michel Aulas, who's never shy of speaking his mind, has suggested Arsenal don't have the money to buy him. </p>

<p>Arsenal remain in the market for a midfield such as Lyon's Houssem Aouar before the deadline</p>

<p>ASTON VILLA  </p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>As with last summer, Villa have spent big to ensure they establish a firmer foothold in the Premier League this season.</p>

<p>Almost £75m has gone on the likes of Ollie Watkins, Matty Cash, Bertrand Traore and Emiliano Martinez.</p>

<p>There were suggestions Villa could yet strengthen in the central midfield area before deadline. </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>And Dean Smith looks to have landed a gem with Chelsea's Ross Barkley joining the club on loan for the season.</p>

<p>Villa had also been in the picture for Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek but moved decisively to sign his England colleague Barkley instead. </p>

<p>Ross Barkley (right) has joined Villa on loan after they were also interested in Loftus-Cheek </p>

<p>BRIGHTON</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Not too many signings so far this summer for Brighton but they have added to their defensive options and also to their midfield creativity with Adam Lallana coming in.</p>

<p>The one remaining area where the Seagulls could strengthen is up front. </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>There have been suggestions that Andi Zeqiri, the 21-year-old Lausanne and Switzerland under-21 striker, is a target.</p>

<p>Reports say Zeqiri is 'of interest' to Brighton with Italian club Parma also interested. </p>

<p>BURNLEY </p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>It's been a summer of frustration in the market for Sean Dyche, who has brought in a back-up goalkeeper and midfielder Dale Stephens and that's it. </p>

<p>Injuries have left the Burnley squad looking threadbare and the finances simply aren't there to go on a huge last-minute shopping spree. </p>

<p>It may be that Dyche has to wait until what is effectively a second transfer window, which allows them to sign players from EFL clubs, from October 5-16.</p>

<p>Dyche wouldn't turn down the opportunity to build up the depth of his squad in pretty much every department. </p>

<p>Who could they get?  </p>

<p>They have been linked with Liverpool and Wales winger Harry Wilson, who spent last season on loan with Bournemouth, but it would take a club record £15m to bring him in. </p>

<p>There's no question Wilson would be a fine signing but Dyche really needs 3-4 players to boost the numbers in his thin squad. </p>

<p>Liverpool winger Harry Wilson has been linked with a £15million switch to Turf Moor </p>

<p>CHELSEA</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>No shortage of new arrivals at one of the biggest spenders of the summer. </p>

<p>Chelsea have added top quality players in attack, attacking midfield, left-back, central defence and in goal to try and lift them to the next level.</p>

<p>But it's clear Chelsea aren't there yet and Tuesday night's defeat to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup served to emphasise their need for a defensive midfielder before the window closes next week.</p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>Chelsea have long been linked with West Ham's Declan Rice this summer and the 21-year-old, formerly of their academy, would certainly fit the bill. </p>

<p>It's likely to take £40m to prise Rice away from their London rivals and it could well be the deal that keeps us most excited during the final few days of the window.</p>

<p>Chelsea could well make a last-minute push to sign West Ham midfielder Declan Rice</p>

<p>CRYSTAL PALACE</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Fair play to Palace for staying true to their philosophy of flying wingers.  Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend have brought speed to their game in recent seasons.</p>

<p>This summer has also seen the arrival of the talented Eberechi Eze from Queens Park Rangers, who can play either out wide or as a No 10.</p>

<p>But Palace wouldn't pass up the opportunity to sign another wide attacker. </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>Palace's efforts to sign Said Benrahma, among the best performers in the Championship last season, from Brentford looked set to be successful.</p>

<p>But their pursuit of the Algerian, valued at £20million, has stalled and now Fulham have emerged as potential competition. </p>

<p>Brentford's flying winger Said Benrahma is a target for Crystal Palace and Fulham </p>

<p>EVERTON</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>There have certainly been no complaints in the blue half of Merseyside about Everton's summer signings with James Rodriguez, Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure looking right at home amid a positive start.</p>

<p>Everton don't need much else but remain in the market for a centre-back on loan before Monday's deadline.  </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>One name in the centre-back frame include Barcelona's Jean-Clair Todibo, who spent last season on loan at Schalke and isn't in Ronald Koeman's plans for the season.</p>

<p>Chelsea's Kurt Zouma has also been mentioned and also Merih Demiral of Juventus.</p>

<p>But the situation remains fluid as we approach deadline day.  </p>

<p>Jean-Clair Todibo (right), who spent last season on loan at Schalke from Barcelona, is a potential centre-back signing on loan for Everton</p>

<p>FULHAM </p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Three games played, 10 goals conceded. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Fulham desperately need defensive reinforcement to ensure their return to the Premier League isn't short-lived.</p>

<p>Co-owner Tony Khan said as much after Monday's 3-0 home defeat to Aston Villa, saying four moves for central defenders had fallen through already for different reasons.  </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>Well, reports on Wednesday suggest Fulham could break the bank and try and sign Milan Skriniar, who was a target for Tottenham, from Inter Milan.</p>

<p>This could well be a club record purchase for Fulham with Skriniar valued at £45million by Milan, a price tag that is putting Spurs off. </p>

<p>Scott Dann of Crystal Palace and Ryan Bennett of Wolves (on loan) are two of the other names in the frame to help plug that gaping defensive hole. </p>

<p>Further forward, Fulham have emerged as a potential destination for Brentford winger Said Benrahma after his expected move to Crystal Palace stalled when close to completion. </p>

<p>Fulham are also sealed the loan signing of winger Ademola Lookman, formerly of Charlton Athletic and Everton, from German club RB Leipzig which would offer a boost to their attacking options. </p>

<p>Ryan Bennett is a potential target for Fulham, whose defensive frailties have been exposed</p>

<p>LEEDS UNITED</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Newly promoted Leeds have already made an exciting and encouraging start to life back in the Premier League.</p>

<p>Coach Marcelo Bielsa has brought in new signings in attack and at centre-half but there would still be more to come.</p>

<p>Another central midfielder and a winger could yet arrive at Elland Road before the slamming shut of the window. </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>A deal with Bayern Munich for midfielder Michael Cuisance, worth £18m, is set to go through subject to a medical. </p>

<p>The Frenchman told the European champions he wanted more playing time and Bayern granted permission for him to speak with Leeds with a deal moving closer. </p>

<p>In terms of wide midfield options, Leeds are keen on Demarai Gray of Leicester or Gyrano Kerk of Utrecht.  They've also been linked with Man United's Dan James.</p>

<p>Leeds are moving closer to an £18m deal for Bayern Munich midfielder Michael Cuisance </p>

<p>LEICESTER </p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Leicester's main focus this summer has been on their defence with Timothy Castagne, a right-back, coming in from Atalanta.</p>

<p>The other priority was a centre-back... </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>And it appears that central defensive box has now been ticked with the £36m signing of Wesley Fofana from French club Saint-Etienne. </p>

<p>They weren't too keen to let him go amid interest from Leicester and West Ham but the Foxes made an acceptable offer that includes add-ons.</p>

<p>And that could well ensure a quiet last few days in the window for Brendan Rodgers and the recruitment staff at the King Power Stadium. </p>

<p>Leicester have had an improved offer of £36million for St Etienne's Wesley Fofana accepted</p>

<p>LIVERPOOL </p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>After their outstanding title-winning campaign, Liverpool had added squad variety by signing Jota, Thiago Alcantara and Kostas Tsimikas for a combined spend of around £72m.</p>

<p>And on the evidence of their performances so far, they remain the team to beat in this season's title race.</p>

<p>With that in mind, it's highly unlikely they will do any more business before the close of the window.   </p>

<p>MANCHESTER CITY</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Now that City have acquired their centre-back of choice in Ruben Dias, who is poised to sign from Benfica for £64m, they could turn attentions to a new left-back.  </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>Any effort to sign a new left-back depends on whether Oleksandr Zinchenko leaves the Etihad Stadium. </p>

<p>Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico has emerged as one potential target should City look to do some more business before Monday's deadline.   </p>

<p>Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico could be a Manchester City target if Zinchenko leaves the club</p>

<p>MANCHESTER UNITED</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>What started out as a pursuit of a right-sided forward - specifically Jadon Sancho - has morphed into something much more complex after a shaky start to the season.</p>

<p>United's hopes of prising Sancho away from Borussia Dortmund are fading by the day with an impasse over the German club's £108million asking price lasting weeks now.</p>

<p>There have been reports of a final offer of £90million being prepared - including £65m up front - in the hope that Dortmund will come to the negotiating table.</p>

<p>But their opening two Premier League games have highlighted a more pressing need for a central defensive partner for Harry Maguire and an addition at left-back.</p>

<p>Victor Lindelof continues to look unconvincing but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer continues to insist he has faith in his central defensive options, which also include Eric Bailly and Axel Tuanzebe.   </p>

<p>Manchester United's pursuit of Jadon Sancho has hit an impasse over Dortmund's valuation</p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>United won't give up on Sancho even though alternatives, such as Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele - on loan - are being mooted.</p>

<p>But bringing in a new left-back looks more imminent.</p>

<p>Porto's Alex Telles is the target and United have tabled an initial offer of £12m for a player that his club value at more like £17m. </p>

<p>United argue that Telles is out of contract next summer and could be signed on a pre-contract in the January window in any case, so Porto may as well get some money for him.  </p>

<p>Porto's Alex Telles is a United target at left-back but the Old Trafford club want to pay £12m</p>

<p>NEWCASTLE</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>A pretty good window for Newcastle all told with Callum Wilson, Jamal Lewis, Ryan Fraser and Jeff Hendrick improving several areas of Steve Bruce's team. </p>

<p>Peru international Rodrigo Vilca, 21, who plays in midfield or the No 10 role, is also poised to sign.  </p>

<p>And that may well be the end of Newcastle's transfer dealings for the summer with the possibility of a loan at centre-back if the right player came up.</p>

<p>SHEFFIELD UNITED</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Three consecutive defeats at the start of the Premier League season have dampened hopes the Blades can repeat last season's heroics.</p>

<p>It's also increased the likelihood of some new faces arriving before the window shuts with a striker and a centre-back the priorities.  </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>One of those boxes could be close to being ticked with Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster moving closer to a £17m move to Bramall Lane. </p>

<p>Liverpool have allowed United to discuss personal terms but Crystal Palace remain interested in the England under-21 international. </p>

<p>Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster is moving closer to a £17million switch to Sheffield United</p>

<p>Centre-back Jack O'Connell needs knee surgery and manager Chris Wilder suggested the other day he could miss the rest of the season.</p>

<p>So a replacement will be urgently needed now with Bournemouth's Steve Cook and Huddersfield's Terence Kongolo among the possibilities.  </p>

<p>SOUTHAMPTON</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>There's not been a great deal incoming business at St Mary's over the summer with defenders Kyle Walker-Peters and Mohammed Salisu the only arrivals so far.</p>

<p>However, the Saints remain in the market for a central midfielder and potentially a winger and another full-back before Monday's deadline.  </p>

<p>The winger will depend on whether Sofiane Boufal leaves the club. Manager Ralph Hasenhuttl admitted earlier this month the Moroccan could leave the club. </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>For the midfielder, a move for Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek was discounted because his wage demands were too high, while there were work permit issues with Toulouse's Ivorian international Ibrahim Sangare, who's heading to PSV Eindhoven. </p>

<p>The Saints recruitment team held a meeting on Tuesday to decide how to proceed. </p>

<p>One potential name could be Celtic's Olivier Ntcham, 24, who is also catching the eye of West Brom.   </p>

<p>Southampton and West Brom are interested in signing Celtic midfielder Olivier Ntcham</p>

<p>TOTTENHAM</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>There's been plenty of business done this summer at Tottenham. Gareth Bale's return on loan from Real Madrid stole all the headlines, of course, but they've also signed Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Sergio Regulion and Matt Doherty. </p>

<p>But clearly Jose Mourinho isn't quite done yet and a centre-half and a striker are next on the shopping list as he tries to ensure Spurs can compete on multiple fronts.</p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>In defence, Tottenham's efforts to sign Milan Skriniar from Inter Milan have faltered. Spurs want to pay in the region of £35m but the Italian club are holding out for £55m.</p>

<p>It's forced Spurs to look for alternatives and they include Chelsea's Antonio Rudiger, who hasn't made Frank Lampard's squad in three of their four games so far this season. </p>

<p>The fact the German has 18 months left on his Chelsea contract complicates both a loan or a permanent move, however, because the Blues would rather not lose him for nothing. </p>

<p>Up front, there was interest in Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik but a deal looks unlikely. Any target in that position knows they'll be back-up to Harry Kane.  </p>

<p>Defender Antonio Rudiger could move across London from Chelsea to Tottenham </p>

<p>WEST BROM</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>It has been a bit of a slog at times, with manager Slaven Bilic not averse to making his frustrations known, but newly-promoted West Brom have strengthened in most areas of the field. </p>

<p>Grady Diangana, Matheus Pereira and Filip Krovinovic are three of their promotion season heroes now on board for another year. </p>

<p>The one area they haven't strengthened is up front - but there's time yet.</p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>The Baggies are trying to push through a move for Watford's Troy Deeney, 32, but some work still needs to be done to get a deal wrapped up.</p>

<p>Deeney has played just a minute for the Hornets so far this season having returned late to training following a knee injury.</p>

<p>Watford's Troy Deeney could yet return to the Premier League with a move to West Brom</p>

<p>WEST HAM</p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Not much business completed so far this summer at West Ham with the permanent signing of Tomas Soucek about your lot.</p>

<p>So it's little wonder they remain on the look out for a centre-back, left-back, right-back, central midfielder and right-sided midfielder in the twilight hour of the transfer window. </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>Slavia Prague's Vladimir Coufal, a former team-mate of Soucek, could be the right-back option with the clubs in talks over a £4m move. </p>

<p>In central defence, the Hammers have already seen bids for Burnley's James Tarkowski and Saint-Etienne's Wesley Fofana flounder.</p>

<p>On their list of alternatives is Fiorentina's 6ft 5in Serbia international Nikola Milenkovic.    </p>

<p>Bruges' goalscoring midfielder Hans Vanaken is also among players manager David Moyes is keen on.</p>

<p>Serbia international Nikola Milenkovic (right) is a potential target for West Ham at centre-back</p>

<p>WOLVES </p>

<p>What do they need?</p>

<p>Nuno Espirito Santo famously doesn't like a bloated squad but with the likes of Diogo Jota and Matt Doherty leaving over the summer, Wolves have needed to do some shopping.</p>

<p>The Porto forward Fabio Silva was signed for £36m and Barcelona right-back Nelson Semedo for £27m - another couple of Portuguese players in their little enclave at Molineux.  </p>

<p>Liverpool's Ki-Jana Hoever and Lyon's Marcal were less heralded signings at right-back and left-back respectively.</p>

<p>They might not be finished yet, though, with the potential of another attacking signing before the deadline. </p>

<p>Who could they get? </p>

<p>The AZ Alkmaar winger Oussama Idrissi, who is valued at just under £15m and has been linked with Napoli and Sevilla, is reportedly a final summer target. </p>

<p>Idrissi enjoyed a great 2019-20 in the Dutch league and Europa League, scoring 17 goals and supplying 10 assists to catch the eye of more prominent clubs.  </p>

<p>Potential Wolves target Oussama Idrissi in action for AZ Alkmaar against Man United last year</p>
