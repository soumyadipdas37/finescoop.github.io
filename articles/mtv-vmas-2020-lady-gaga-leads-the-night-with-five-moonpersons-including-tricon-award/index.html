        <p>Lady Gaga was the big winner at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards as she earned five awards on the night and even had nine outfit changes throughout the two-hour event.</p>

<p>The event had been filmed over the past few days at several different locations throughout New York City with production abiding by social distancing guidelines as it aired 'live' on Sunday night. </p>

<p>At the event, the 34-year-oid singer took to the stage to accept the show's FIRST EVER 'MTV Tricon' award for her unparalleled impact and dedication to music, fashion, and activism.</p>

<p>She also took home VMAs for Best Collaboration and Song Of The Year for her hit Rain On Me with fellow pop princess Ariana Grande and the highly coveted Artist Of The Year gong.   </p>

<p>FIRST EVER: Lady Gaga took to the stage to accept the show's FIRST EVER 'MTV Tricon' award for her unparalleled impact and dedication to music, fashion, and activism</p>

<p>Tricon: 'My gosh. Guys. This is so cool. This means a lot to me. It means more to me then you probably even realize. I've been making music since I was a little girl, even though I had really, really big dreams, I truly never could have imagined that someday I would be given an award like this that honored me for so many of my passions,' began Gaga, who had her Tricon award presented to her by model Bella Hadid</p>

<p>On the moon: She proudly posed with all five of her shiny new moonpersons </p>

<p>'My gosh. Guys. This is so cool. This means a lot to me. It means more to me then you probably even realize. I've been making music since I was a little girl, even though I had really, really big dreams, I truly never could have imagined that someday I would be given an award like this that honored me for so many of my passions,' began Gaga, who had her Tricon award presented to her by model Bella Hadid. </p>

<p>'I want you to know I've failed over and over again as an actress and as a musician when I was young. So I gave back to the local community through service as a young woman in New York, philanthropy became a much bigger part of my life as a star and I started the born this way foundation with my mother, Cynthia.'</p>

<p>Gaga said that she wanted to 'share this award with everybody at home tonight' because 'everyone is their own form of a Tricon.'</p>

<p>'I wish for you to think right now of three things that define who you are and take a moment to reward yourself for your bravery. This has not been an easy year for a lot of people. What I see in the world is a massive triumph of courage. I also hope that people at home that have big dreams, I hope they see me here today accepting this award and know how grateful I am. I want you to know that you can do this too.' </p>

<p>Evolution: Gaga had nine different outfit changes during the two-hour event including her red carpet look (left) and while she accepted awards for Best Collaboration (center) and Best Song (right)</p>

<p>Lady Gaga isn't exactly a wallflower when it comes to red carpet events, but at the 2020 MTV VMAs, the superstar singer totally stole the show!</p>

<p>With the help of stylist Nicola Formichetti, she wore looks by the likes of Area, Valentino and Iris van Herpen (and of course some seriously fierce face masks!), but it was this emerald green ensemble by Christopher John Rogers that really made us swoon.</p>

<p>It looks like a ballgown, but it's actually a taffeta skirt and matching top, and we love the voluminous shape and kimono sleeves. The designer is one to watch, and Lady Gaga is joining an elite list of fans - Michelle Obama and Tracee Ellis Ross for starters!</p>

<p>This Autumn/Winter '20 collection look will soon be available exclusively at NET-A-PORTER (click right to be ready and waiting with your credit card), but for now, make them green with envy in a Gaga-inspired gown from our edit below.</p>

<p>Shining star: She donned two silver looks as she won Artist Of The Year (left) and accepted the first ever Tricon Award (center) before slipping into a vintage MTV T-shirt while posing with her five trophies at the end of the night (right)</p>

<p>To close out her speech Gaga aimed to ensure all those in quarantine that 'just because we are separated right now, and culture may feel less alive in some ways, I know a renaissance is coming.'</p>

<p>'The wrath of pop culture will inspire you and the rage of art will empower you as it responds to hardship with its generosity and love. This is what I believe. I want nothing more than to be your artist in 2020. It's a total privilege. I love you. Stay safe. Speak your mind. I might sound like a broken record, but wear a mask. It's a sign of respect. Thank you.'</p>

<p>The A Star Is Born actress made a total of nine outfit changes throughout the course of the award ceremony on Sunday.</p>

<p>Gaga first graced the red carpet in a NASA-inspired ensemble, complete with a fashion forward space helmet, before heading into the venue to accept her awards.</p>

<p>During the span of her Rain On Me performance, Gaga managed to showcase three different looks on the stage. </p>

<p>She blazed through complex choreography in a purple latex two piece, a mint green balcony bra and a pair of unique harness shorts, and then an Alien inspired bodysuit.</p>

<p>Best Collaboration: Lady Gaga took to the stage to accept the award for Best Collaboration for her hit Rain On Me with fellow pop princess Ariana Grande</p>

<p>Song Of The Year: Lady Gaga returned to the stage in a stunning green ball gown - and an even more bizarre facial covering that had tusks coming out of it - to accept the VMA for Song of the Year for her collaborative hit with Grande</p>

<p>Artist Of The Year: Gaga beat out a plethora of other big name musicians, when she returned to the socially-distanced stage to accept the Artist Of The Year award</p>

<p>Chameleon: The A Star Is Born actress made a total of nine outfit changes throughout the course of the award ceremony on Sunday</p>

<p>After the show, Gaga opted for a more casual - and more comfortable - ensemble that included a vintage oversized MTV t-shirt dress and her favorite pair of platform boots.</p>

<p>Gaga's first VMA of the night was the award for Best Collaboration music video for her duet Rain On Me that featured Ariana Grande. </p>

<p>'Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you, MTV. This means the world. Ariana and I really connected through this song,' began the Chromatica songstress in her first lengthy acceptance speech.</p>

<p>Evolving: Gaga first graced the red carpet in a NASA-inspired ensemble, complete with a fashion forward space helmet, before heading into the venue to accept her awards</p>

<p>Three: During the span of her Rain On Me performance, Gaga managed to showcase three different looks on the stage</p>

<p>Killin' it: She blazed through complex choreography in a purple latex two piece, a mint green balcony bra and a pair of unique harness shorts, and then an Alien inspired bodysuit</p>

<p>Casual: After the show, Gaga opted for a more casual - and more comfortable - ensemble that included a vintage oversized MTV t-shirt dress and her favorite pair of platform boots</p>

<p>Though Ariana was not by her side, Gaga took a moment to gush over her collaborator and the bond they fostered crafting the song and its out of this world music video. </p>

<p>'Me and Ariana are truly soul sisters. Girl, this is for us. We have both been through some together. We are willing to share it with each other I love you.'</p>

<p>'When we were in the studio, we turned our tears that felt like and less rainfall into diamonds. I will treasure these diamonds with you forever, honey. I love you. I love you, little monsters. You rock. Thank you, MTV,' she concluded, before walking off in her dangerously tall platform boots. </p>

<p>Lady Gaga returned to the stage in a stunning green ball gown - and an even more bizarre facial covering that had tusks coming out of it - to accept the VMA for Song of the Year for her collaborative hit with Grande.</p>

<p>Despite having already given a gracious acceptance speech earlier in the show, the Born This Way singer took a moment to tell a personal anecdote to the those tuning in.</p>

<p>Thankful: 'Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you, MTV. This means the world. Ariana and I really connected through this song,' began the 34-year-old singer in her acceptance speech</p>

<p>Gushing: Though Ariana was not by her side, Gaga took a moment to gush over her collaborator and the bond they fostered crafting the song and its out of this world music video</p>

<p>Studio time: 'When we were in the studio, we turned our tears that felt like and less rainfall into diamonds. I will treasure these diamonds with you forever, honey. I love you. I love you, little monsters. You rock. Thank you, MTV,' she concluded, before walking off in her dangerously tall platform boots</p>

<p>'I remember when I wrote the lyrics for the chorus and I sang them for my producer and collaborator and the lyrics were "I'd rather be dry but at least I'm alive. Rain on me." I remember thinking I had cried so many tears that it felt like unfathomable downpour for my eyes but even without monitoring, you don't have to drown -- even with that much rain, you don't have to drown, even though it feels like you are. You can swim. If there's a strong current and the waves keep crashing over you, you'll keep swimming and you'll reach the center of the ocean where it's calm, still, and peaceful,' said a visibly emotional Gaga.</p>

<p>She admitted that winning the VMA for Song Of The Year has been her 'favorite' to win because '[her] heart is as a songwriter.' </p>

<p>Gaga beat out a plethora of other big name musicians, when she returned to the socially-distanced stage to accept the Artist Of The Year award.</p>

<p>She reappeared in her most awe-inspiring ensemble that looked straight out of the Lord Of The Rings. </p>

<p>Soul sister: 'Me and Ariana are truly soul sisters. Girl, this is for us. We have both been through some together. We are willing to share it with each other I love you,' said Gaga</p>

<p>Double take: Despite having already given a gracious acceptance speech earlier in the show, the Born This Way singer took a moment to tell a personal anecdote to the those tuning in</p>

<p>Favorite: She admitted that winning the VMA for Song Of The Year has been her 'favorite' to win because '[her] heart is as a songwriter'</p>

<p>Artist Of The Year: Gaga beat out a plethora of other big name musicians, when she returned to the socially-distanced stage to accept the Artist Of The Year award</p>

<p>'Oh, my gosh. This is so exciting. Tank you so much. Being an artist is the only thing I've ever wanted to be in my whole life. I never wanted to be anything else. I'm a member when I first came to California after I built this small following for myself in New York, I would be taken out of these fancy dinners with executives who wanted to sign me. I remember I never, ever ordered anything more than out whiskey neat or a large sake and they used to ask me, why aren't you eating. I said because I didn't come for the California roll,' recalled Gaga in her acceptance speech.</p>

<p>'Everyone always knew if they were hanging out with me that I was on a mission to spread joy through culture, through dance, through music. I've written using my whole life I feel so honored that I get to do this every day. Thank you so much for this award. </p>

<p>'During a year that I am promoting Chromatica." It's brought me so much joy that you can spin your struggles into gold and you got to believe in yourself and surround yourself with good people. I surround myself with my family, they are here, my family. I love you! If you want to win an award like this, don't eat the California roll. They know you mean business. I love you. Thank you, MTV. Thank you, fans. You are the best,' she concluded.</p>

<p>As well as wowing the audience with her impressive outfits, Gaga also showed off stunning silver-blue tresses that were colored especially for the ceremony by Frederic Aspiras, who revealed that the hue was inspired by the sky - both 'in the earliest morning before the sun comes out' and 'at dusk' just after the sun has set.</p>

<p>'Love inspired the look. Bringing all the elements of earth, wind and fire,' the hair pro explained. 'Lady Gaga’s journey throughout the years has inspired me to create hairstyles and color combinations that encapsulate this journey. She is tough, brave, a musical genius, a visionary and overall kind human being that believes in love and kindness in the world.'</p>

<p>Frederic used products from the Joico Color Intensity collection in order to achieve the perfect color, revealing that he mixed a shade called Mermaid Blue with pink and violet. </p>

<p>For her on-stage style, the hair pro used shampoo and conditioner from the Joico Blonde Life collection, before drying her tresses with the GHD Helios Professional Hair Dryer, dividing it with a zigzag part, and then creating loose curls with the GHD Curve Classic Wave Wand. </p>

<p>More texture was added with the Joico Beach Shake Texturing Finisher, before Frederic gave Gaga some extra lift at the root with the GHD Rise Hot Brush.  </p>
