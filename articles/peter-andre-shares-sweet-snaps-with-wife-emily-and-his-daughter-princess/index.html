        <p>He is currently holidaying in Cyprus with his wife Emily and their children.</p>

<p>And Peter Andre gave followers an insight into their getaway with a selection of Instagram snapshots, as he shared pictures from their dinner out together.</p>

<p>The TV star, 47, looked handsome in a palm print shirt as he cosied up to his wife, 31, for a series of playful selfies, which he posted on his Stories.</p>

<p>Cute! Peter Andre gave followers an insight into their getaway with a selection of Instagram snapshots, as he shared pictures from their dinner out together</p>

<p>The affectionate star captioned the selection of images: 'Cyprus love.'</p>

<p>The father-of-four was every inch the doting dad as he shared a series of snaps with his eldest daughter Princess, 13, who he shares with ex-wife Katie Price, 42. </p>

<p>Peter and Princess posed for the snap together in a restaurant which the singer captioned: 'Love you bist.', which is his nickname for his daughter.</p>

<p>Father and daughter: The father-of-four was every inch the doting dad as he shared a series of snaps with his eldest daughter Princess, 13, who he shares with ex-wife Katie Price, 42</p>

<p>'Love you': Peter and Princess posed for the snap together in a restaurant which the singer captioned: 'Love you bist.', which is his nickname for his daughter</p>

<p>Peter also shared some snaps of himself and Emily exploring a local park together earlier in the day. </p>

<p>Their holiday comes after they revealed they are considering having a third baby together, after their youngest child starts school next year.</p>

<p>They are already raising Amelia, six, and Theo, three, together – while they also take care of the hunk's teen children Junior, 15, and Princess.</p>

<p>And NHS doctor Emily has admitted that she and her husband are now mulling over the idea of expanding their brood, after Princess begged for another sibling.</p>

<p>Adventurers: Peter also shared some snaps of himself and Emily exploring a local park together earlier in the day</p>

<p>Expanding the brood: Their holiday comes after they revealed they are considering having a third baby together, after their youngest child starts school next year. Pictured in 2019</p>

<p>Writing in her OK! column, she said: "Pete has said Princess really wants us to have another baby, and I think Millie would also say yes to another sibling, too.</p>

<p>'At the moment, I'm happy with the way things are and am in no rush for another baby. Whenever I think it's a good idea I just remember how far we've come and how lovely things are with the kids now.</p>

<p>'We’re just at the stage where we can do really fun things with them and have quality time together without worrying about a changing bag or nappies. However, I have said that when Theo goes to school next year I may have a change of heart.'</p>

<p>Family: As well as his two children with Emily, Peter is also dad to Junior, 15, and Princess, 13</p>

<p>Mysterious Girl hitmaker Peter had previously revealed that his son Junior was far from keen about the idea of having a younger brother or sister.</p>

<p>Writing for new! magazine, the star explained: 'Bista [Princess] really wants us to have another child, but Junior is like "No!"</p>

<p>'He says he doesn't want to be 17 with a baby that's just been born – he doesn't there to be that much of an age difference. But how does he think I'll feel? There will be 47 years in the difference.'</p>

<p>Last month, Peter shared a stunning glimpse of his idyllic wedding to his wife Emily to mark their fifth anniversary as a married couple.</p>

<p>One big family: He shares his teen children with ex-wife Katie Price, who is also mother to Harvey, 18, Jett, seven, and Bunny, six, from other relationships</p>

<p>The pop star offered his followers a sneak peek inside his idyllic nuptials to the NHS doctor, as he shared snaps from their wedding album. </p>

<p>In a series of unseen clips and snaps from the day, the newlyweds could be seen sharing an emotional embrace and letting their hair down on the dance floor.</p>

<p>Emily looked breathtakingly stunning in a floor-length lace dress with intricate semi-sheer lace detailing across the chest and sleeves of the garment. </p>

<p>The ballgown style dress was teamed with a traditional flowing veil, while she head a bouquet of pastel-coloured roses in her hands.</p>

<p>Not keen: Mysterious Girl hitmaker Peter had previously revealed that his son Junior was far from keen about the idea of having a younger brother or sister </p>

<p>Retaining privacy: While fans have become used to seeing Junior and Princess in the media, Emily has made a point of keeping her offspring's faces out of the limelight </p>

<p>Later in the day as the evening reception commenced, Emily appeared to chance into a different gown, which featured appliqué flowers rather than lace.</p>

<p>Peter looked smart and handsome in a three-piece suit with a steel grey tie, which his groomsmen all mirrored.</p>

<p>Once the party got going, Peter removed his tie as he opted for a more casual ensemble to dance the night away with his new bride.</p>

<p>The couple looked entirely loved-up as they held each other in their arms, while watching the fireworks at the end of the evening. </p>

<p>Peter, who wed Emily at Mamhead House in Exeter in 2015, shared his thoughts on the magical memories.</p>

<p>He wrote in tribute to his wife: 'You’re funny, kind, intelligent and stunning. Happy 5th wedding Anniversary Emily.'</p>

<p>The couple had planned to mark the milestone with a romantic return to Santorini, Greece, where they had honeymooned.</p>

<p>But due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown they have been forced to stay at home with their brood and Emily also had to isolate. </p>

<p>Wedding: Last month, Peter shared a glimpse of his wedding to Emily on their fifth anniversary</p>
