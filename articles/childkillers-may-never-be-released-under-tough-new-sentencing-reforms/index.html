        <p>Childkillers will face the prospect of spending the rest of their lives behind bars under plans to toughen up prison sentences unveiled today.</p>

<p>Ministers want those convicted of slaughtering youngsters to face a whole life order (WLO) to keep them in prison until they die unless there is a clear justification for giving then a shorter term.</p>

<p>Under plans unveiled by Justice Secretary Robert Buckland today some of the UK's worst criminals, including young terrorists, rapists and other violent offenders will face extended prison sentences.</p>

<p>Sex attackers and brutal thugs will serve two-thirds of their prison terms instead of the current half before being considered for release under the shake-up of the criminal punishment system. </p>

<p>Mr  Buckland also unveiled plans to give judges the power to hand 18 to 20-year-olds whole life sentences amid an outcry that one of the Manchester terrorist bombers avoided this sentence because of his age. </p>

<p>The revamp will also beef up non-custodial community sentences, including 20-hour-a-day curfews and the use of satellite monitoring for convicted burglars. </p>

<p>Childkillers are currently eligible for a so-called 'starting point' of a WLO if their crime involves abduction or a sexual or sadistic element. But under a white paper publiced today, it would apply to everyone convicted of the death of a minor.</p>

<p>In a speech this morning Mr Buckland said the public 'rightly expects child killers to feel the fullest and harshest extent of the law', adding: 'We will therefore ensure a Whole Life Order is not just available to sentencers in these cases but that it will be their starting point.</p>

<p>'In exceptional circumstances we will also give judges the discretion to impose a Whole Life Order on those aged 18 to 20, where currently only those aged 21 or over may receive this severest of punishments.'</p>

<p>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland announced a major overhaul of sentencing that will see 18 to 20-year-olds become eligible for whole life sentences</p>

<p>Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, was jailed for 55 years but the mass murderer could not face a 'whole life tariff'  because he was under at the time the atrocity was committed</p>

<p>Currently a very specific set of crimes can attract a whole life order. </p>

<p>These are life sentences where life means life. </p>

<p>The Government wants to add childkillers to the list.</p>

<p>They include: </p>

<p>A 'starting point' is the length of time a judge uses as a marker when sentencing a criminal. From there, time can either be added or subtracted depending on the specific aggravating or mitigating features of the case.</p>

<p>The White Paper notes: 'Although those committing the premeditated murder of a child will be expected to be given a WLO, judges will still have discretion to depart from this and impose a minimum tariff (ie a specific sentence in years) if they consider that to be the most appropriate and just sentence in all the particular circumstances of the case. </p>

<p>Adult offenders given life sentences in other circumstances would also spend longer behind bars before they can be assessed for release under the plans, he added.</p>

<p>But there must also be efforts to intervene to prevent low-level and repeat offenders from 'going back and forth to prison, for short custodial sentences that hold little rehabilitative value for them'.      </p>

<p>He said: 'Offenders in this category often live chaotic lifestyles, sometimes driven by drug and alcohol misuse, or poor mental health. Their backgrounds are often characterised by entrenched poverty, absent role models, and a lack of any decent education. This makes for bleak prospects and many offenders believe they have few options but to get involved in criminality.</p>

<p>'There is no doubt that they deserve punishment but, if we are to have any chance of turning their lives around - and in the process preventing crime - then we need to divert them towards lives that hold the promise of the things we all want from life - a place to call home, meaningful work, a future that's better than the past.</p>

<p>'If we're going to offer offenders opportunities to work hard towards these things, then we must identify their individual needs and ensure the sentencing toolkit is able to meet them.'</p>

<p>The worst sex and violent offenders can already receive a life sentence. Today's change sees convicts sentenced to between four and seven years made to serve two-thirds of sentences behind bars instead of being eligible for release on licence at the halfway stage.</p>

<p>Last month the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber was jailed for 55 years - the longest minimum life term in history.</p>

<p>Justice Jeremy Baker told the hearing Hashem Abedi 'may never be released' but it was revealed the mass murderer could not face a 'whole life tariff' despite being found guilty in England's biggest terror trial because he was under 21 when he helped his brother plot the bomb attack.   </p>

<p>Whole life orders for child killers, including the ability for judges to hand out this maximum punishment to 18-20 year-olds in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>New powers to halt the automatic release of offenders who pose a terrorism risk or are a danger to the public.</p>

<p>Ending the release of offenders sentenced to four-seven years at the halfway point, instead requiring them to serve two-thirds of their term.</p>

<p>Longer minimum sentences for 15-17 year-old murderers.</p>

<p>Prisoners sentenced to life will serve longer before being eligible for parole.</p>

<p>Using 'sobriety tags' to clampdown on alcohol-related crimes.</p>

<p>Using GPS to track burglars, robbers and thieves when they are released from prison.</p>

<p>Former Victims' Commissioner Baroness Helen Newlove, whose husband was beaten to death by three teenagers in 2007, welcomed the bill, but called for more.</p>

<p>She told GMB this morning: 'It is something I will fight for in the House of Lords when this comes through, but we've got to ensure that there's legal rights for victims, survivors and their families. </p>

<p>'I think its been shown recently, with PC Harper's widow Lissie, that's shown how the system actually is broken. </p>

<p>'At the end of the day the Criminal Justice System is on its knees, sentencing is one stream of it, but it's after the event when you go back, we have to then try and live our lives</p>

<p>'It's the most loneliest time and it's the hardest time, that's why I welcome these tougher sentences, however I'm still on pause because it has to go right through Parliament.</p>

<p>'The one thing I do welcome, is actually 18 years of age in this country, you're seen as an adult and it's something I have always said about my daughter Zoe, who was 18 at the time of losing her father. </p>

<p>'She was treated as an adult, but one of the offenders in the dock who was 18, he didn't go to 'big boy prison,' as I put it. </p>

<p>'They had to look after him before they put him in an adult prison, so we have conflicting messages. It's important people understand this is just the beginning. </p>

<p>'Something that I really want is victim's law to ensure that legal rights we can follow this through and ensure we have a voice within that criminal justice system.' </p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already said the reforms will make it easier for 'judges to put dangerous offenders behind bars for longer'.</p>

<p>But the package, covering in England and Wales, will also include measures at the lower end of the sentencing spectrum.</p>

<p>Community sentences given to offenders instead of prison will be made tougher by doubling the length of time offenders can be subject to curfew restrictions to two years.</p>

<p>Baroness Helen Newlove, whose husband was beaten to death by three teenagers in 2007, has welcomed tougher sentences, but has called for a 'victim's law' to support families through criminal proceedings</p>

<p>The orders can be made more flexible to help offenders keep their jobs, for example by having fewer restrictions from Monday to Friday but then stricter curfews of up to 20 hours at weekends.</p>

<p>In an effort to tackle reoffending, for the first time GPS electronic location monitoring will be routinely used to track burglars, robbers and thieves when they are released from prison.</p>

<p>The technology will allow probation to monitor an offender's whereabouts and, if appropriate, share this data with the police.</p>

<p>For criminals who stay out of trouble, the requirement to routinely disclose offences to employers for non-sensitive roles will be reduced.</p>

<p>Custodial sentences of up to a year will become spent after a further 12 months without reoffending, instead of four years, while terms of one-to-four years will no longer be disclosed after four crime-free years - down from seven.</p>

<p>Sentences of more than four years will not automatically be disclosed to employers once a seven-year period of rehabilitation has been served, instead of for the rest of an offender's life. </p>

<p>Mr Buckland said: 'For too long our justice system has been beset by complex and confusing laws which the public often feel fail in their most essential aims - to keep them safe and properly punish offenders.</p>

<p>'That ends today. This White Paper is the first step in a fundamental shift in our approach to sentencing, towards one that is fairer, smarter and ultimately better protects the public.</p>

<p>'Our measures will ensure the most serious violent and sexual offenders get the prison time they deserve, while new community interventions and changes to rules around criminal records will help boost rehabilitation and cut reoffending - which means creating fewer victims.'</p>

<p>The Government has set a target of 20,000 extra police officers but Mr Johnson told the Cabinet on Tuesday that 'there's no point in catching the criminals if they are simply going to be let out early'.</p>

<p>He said: 'We have seen far too many cases recently of criminals being let out early and then offending again and the judges being unable to impose the stiff sentences that they want and that society wants because of the restrictive guidelines that they face.' </p>

<p>He told ministers that he wanted 'sensible approaches to sentencing, making it easier for judges to put dangerous offenders behind bars for longer'. </p>

<p>He promised to end the 'ridiculous state of affairs whereby a criminal can just get back out onto the streets even when it is clear to everybody – including the court – that they pose a threat to justice and a threat to the British public'.</p>

<p>'That includes longer sentences for child killers, lowering the age limit on whole-life tariffs for the worst offenders and locking (up) for longer more of the most violent criminals before they can apply for parole,' he said. </p>
