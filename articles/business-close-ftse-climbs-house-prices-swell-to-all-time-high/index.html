        <p>Property prices across Britain rose 2 per cent in August from the previous month, boosted by pent-up demand following the lockdown, according to new figures from Nationwide.</p>

<p>Natiownide said prices recovered from recent dip to reach new all-time high in August. The lender said the increase last month followed a 1.8 per cent rise in July, and it marks the highest monthly rise since February 2014.</p>

<p>Annual house price growth jumped to 3.7 per cent last month from 1.5% in July.</p>

<p>Across the country, the average price of a home stood at £224,123 in August, Nationwide said. </p>

<p>As the nation and economy tries to get back on its feet post-lockdown, the Government has today launched its Kickstart Scheme, aimed at helping young people get into work.</p>

<p>Businesses can join the scheme from today, with the state paying employers £1,500 to help set up support and training. </p>

<p>In company news, Barratt Developments has scrapped its special dividend for shareholders after suffering a 46 per cent drop in annual profits. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, The Gym Group reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of £26.3million for the six months to 30 June, down from the profit of £7.1million. </p>

<p>The FTSE 100 is faring better than yesterday, up 1.15 per cent to 5,929 in early morning trading.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>The FTSE 250 rose 0.6 per cent, or 99 points, to 17,704. </p>

<p>Heathrow airport could cut a quarter of its frontline staff after failing to reach an agreement with trade unions over pay and conditions, Sky News reports.</p>

<p>The airport reportedly started a 45-day consultation period today that could lead to compulsory job losses.</p>

<p>Around one quarter, or some 1,200 jobs, including those of airport's engineers, airside operations and security staff, could be lost if a deal is not reached, according to the report.</p>

<p>Here's what the BoE's governor Andrew Bailey had to say about the potential for a reduction in interest rates from the current level of 0.1 per cent.</p>

<p>He said: 'It’s in the box of tools. We’re not planning it at the moment, we’ve got no plans to use it imminently but it is in the box. If it was the right thing to do… then the case for bringing it out of the box would be strong.'</p>

<p>Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex, sums up the day:</p>

<p>Already aggressive in their gains, the US open, and the falls for the pound and euro, ensured that the European session only got better. The DAX led the charge with a 2.2% increase, followed closely by the CAC, which rose 2%.</p>

<p>As for the FTSE, after striking a 3-month low on Tuesday, the UK index reclaimed 95 points, putting it back within touching distance of 5950.</p>

<p>A smattering of losses across its oil and banking stocks were more than compensated for by the stellar growth for its housebuilders.</p>

<p>News that UK house prices have hit an all-time high thanks to the stamp duty holiday drove the sector forward, with Barratt Developments up 8.6%, Taylor Wimpey up 6.6% and Persimmon and Berkeley up around 5%.</p>

<p>One in three Britons are vowing to continue money-saving habits created by lockdown and reduce the amount of time they spend eating out in UK restaurants. </p>

<p>New data published by a Goldman Sachs-affiliated bank also reveal that one in five Britons have slashed spending on takeaways while 25 per cent of people surveyed have said they will carry on doing more home-cooking going forward.</p>

<p>Full story below...</p>

<p>The FTSE 250 is up 0.5% at 17,698.</p>

<p>The pound, which rose above $1.34 yesterday, has retreated, with £1 buying $1.33 on currency markets this afternoon.</p>

<p>Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden and another interest-rate setter, Gertjan Vlieghe, warned this afternoon that Britain's economy could suffer more damage than spelt out by the central bank last month.</p>

<p>Ramsden told lawmakers that the BoE had estimated the level of Britain's economic output would permanently be about 1.5 percentage points lower than it would have been without the pandemic.</p>

<p>'For me all the risks are really that that number will be greater than 1.5%,' Ramsden said.</p>

<p>Vlieghe said there was 'a material risk' that it could take several years for Britain's economy to return to full capacity after its coronavirus shock.</p>

<p>The BoE said in August it expected Britain's economy to recover its pre-COVID-19 size by the end of next year.</p>

<p>House prices have hit a fresh record high, according to Nationwide's long-running index as the property market seemingly defies economic gravity.</p>

<p>But a growing number of experts in the property industry fear the 'mini boom' in house prices will not last into the latter stages of next year as unemployment and the recession eats into the sector.</p>

<p>Jane Denton has the story...</p>

<p>Wall Street has opened, and technology stocks have pushed the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 opened higher by 17.11 points, or 0.49%, at 3,543.76.</p>

<p>The Nasdaq rose 107.60 points, or 0.90%, to 12,047.26.</p>

<p>The Dow Jones rose 91.13 points, or 0.32%, to 28,736.79.</p>

<p>The session started 15 minutes ago.</p>

<p>One of the only banks to offer 10 per cent deposit mortgages has pulled its deals in response to a surge in demand.</p>

<p>HSBC today said that it will temporarily suspend deals for new borrowers with a 10 per cent deposit due to a 'significant consequence on service levels' following a significant uptick in new borrower enquiries.</p>

<p>The move has dealt a blow to first-time buyers who typically have smaller deposits and are finding their savings' purchase power eroded by rising house prices. </p>

<p>Will Kirkman has the story...</p>

<p>Yesterday shares in Zoom soared by 35 per cent after it revealed profits had rocketed by more than 3,000 per cent between May and July.</p>

<p>This added over £20billion to its value, meaning it is now worth around £90billion – more than HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group put together.</p>

<p>Full story below...</p>

<p>Yo! Sushi has confirmed plans to shut 19 of its 69 restaurants and cut up to 250 jobs after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) restructuring process was approved by its creditors.</p>

<p>The chain, famous for its sushi plates on conveyor belts, had announced the cuts on 14 August. </p>

<p>Yo! shut its sites temporarily in the face of the pandemic in March, before starting to reopen sites in July, with a new model in place to deliver food to customers in line with safety regulations.</p>

<p>Richard Hodgson, chief executive of YO!, said:</p>

<p>These are exceptionally challenging times for our sector and we are pleased that our creditors have supported us in today’s vote.</p>

<p>This will ensure YO! has a solid foundation to continue to adapt to the changes brought about by Covid-19, and allows us to focus on reopening remaining sites and rolling out our new restaurant model.</p>

<p>A London judge has given the go ahead to the airline's restructuring plan in a court hearing today, Reuters is reporting.</p>

<p>Last month, Virgin's shareholders, banks, aircraft owners and suppliers owed money backed the plan, which is aimed at helping the company survive the coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>The deal involves a £400million cash injection including £200million from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. </p>

<p>Virgin, which is closing its Gatwick airport base and cutting 3,550 jobs, had warned it would run out of cash by September without a deal.</p>

<p>The £1.2billion rescue involves only private funds after Branson's pleas for a Government bailout fell on deaf ears. Creditors are being asked to accept 20 per cent less than they are owed, and for the repayments to be rescheduled. </p>

<p>Unilever, the consumer giant behind brands like Domestos and Persil, has pledged to drop fossil fuels from its cleaning products by 2030.</p>

<p>The group said it would invest €1billion to make it happen, using ingredients made from plants like algae and waste materials instead of oil-based ingredients in its cleaning and laundry products.</p>

<p>The move comes at a time when Unilever is facing unprecedented demand for cleaning products in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>In July, the company said sales of its Cif surface cleaners and Domestos bleach jumped in the double-digits in the first half of 2020.</p>

<p>The Gym Group has swung to a £26million pre-tax loss after its gyms remained closed for months due to the pandemic and it lost nearly 100,000 customers during the first half of the year.</p>

<p>The no-frills chain, which was forced to shut down all its 183 gyms on March 20 as the UK went to lockdown and reopened them only on July 25, said the prolonged period of closure means it made 'virtually no revenue'.</p>

<p>Monzo is set to become the first major UK bank to charge its customers to make withdrawals from an ATM, amid fears Britain is increasingly going cashless.</p>

<p>The smartphone bank said today it would charge customers a 3 per cent fee if they withdrew more than £250 from UK and European ATMs over a 30-day period from 31 October, unless they use the bank as their main current account.</p>

<p>George Nixon has the story....</p>

<p>Ryanair carried 7million passengers in August, a 53 per cent decline compared to the 14.9million it carried last year.</p>

<p>It recorded a 73 per cent load factor, which measures how well an airline fills available seats, similar to the level in July.</p>

<p>The low-cost airline last month decided to reduce its flight capacity by a further 20 per cent in September and October after a reimposition of some travel restrictions led to a weakness in forward bookings, particularly among business travellers.</p>

<p>Ryanair shares are flat at €11.82.</p>

<p>European stocks have joined the FTSE 100 with a decent recovery today, including a 2.2 per cent rise in Germany's Dax and a similar rise in France's CAC 40.</p>

<p>David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets, sums up the day so far:</p>

<p>The mood in Europe is bullish even though the landscape hasn’t changed too much in the past 24 hours. Hopes in relation to a vaccine for Covid-19 and optimism that US lawmakers will reach a compromise with regards to the coronavirus relief package are doing the rounds.</p>

<p>The pullback in the pound today has helped some internationally exposed stocks like GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Diageo, Unilever and British American Tobacco, as the slip in sterling should help their revenue. The UK banking sector underperformed yesterday, and it is largely lower today. Commodity stocks and home builders are higher, while the airline industry is mixed.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, European indices lost ground in the past two sessions so now some of those losses are being reversed. The CAC 40 is comfortably above 5,000, the DAX 30 is up 2.3%, while the FTSE 100 is 0.5% shy of the 6,000 mark.</p>

<p>Lego said sales of its toys jumped 14 per cent in the first six months of the year as families under lockdowns spent more time playing together at home.</p>

<p>The Danish toy maker, known for its colorfoul plastic bricks, said they see the momentum continue even once kids go back to school.</p>

<p>Last year, Lego accelerated investments in e-commerce and its brand website, which saw the number of visitors double to 100million in the first half of this year.</p>

<p>This left it in a position to be able to cash in through online sales when all its 616 shops worldwide were closed at some point during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The FTSE 100 is up 1.7 per cent at 5,961.</p>

<p>Barratt Developments is the top riser, with shares up 7 per cent. </p>

<p>Shares in Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon are also in demand, up around 4 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively. </p>

<p>Other risers include engine maker Rolls-Royce, which has bounced back, rising 5 per cent, after yesterday hitting a 16-year low, and ITV, which is 4 per cent higher.</p>

<p>Commenting on Barratt's decision to scrap its special dividend, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says:</p>

<p>This is a perfectly rational response to a highly uncertain backdrop.</p>

<p>It is indicative of management’s suspicion that the big jump in activity following the property market’s emergence from deep freeze is due to a flood of pent-up demand, boosted by a stamp duty holiday, which will eventually ebb away.</p>

<p>News of UK house prices hitting record highs may provide some short-term fizz for Barratt and the rest of the sector but there could be a lingering hangover to come.</p>

<p>Unemployment and a buoyant housing market typically don’t make for good bedfellows, so rising levels of joblessness are almost certain to create headaches in due course.</p>

<p>The Government has today launched its £2billion Kickstart scheme aimed at helping young people into work as fears a generation could be left behind as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Businesses have been urged to sign up to use the scheme which Chancellor Rishi Sunak said will create thousands of new roles nationwide for youngsters aged between 16-24.</p>

<p>Under the scheme, employers will be able to offer young people on Universal Credit state-subsidised work placements for six months. The state will also pay employers £1,500 to set up support and training for people on a Kickstart placement.</p>

<p>The Gym Group was forced to shut its doors for months at the peak of lockdown.</p>

<p>It is therefore little surprise that the company saw revenue drop nearly 50 per cent to £37.3million in the first half, while falling to a loss of £26.3million.</p>

<p>At the same point a year ago, the gym group posted a profit of £7.1million.</p>

<p>Chief executive Richard Darwin said: 'Following our decisive actions during lockdown to minimise costs and secure additional liquidity, we have reopened as the strongest capitalised company in the sector.</p>

<p>'We anticipate the long-term structural growth of low-cost gyms will continue to be driven by the underlying interest in health and fitness, which is accelerating as a result of Covid-19 and the government’s initiative to reduce obesity. </p>

<p>'With the likelihood of a challenging economic environment in the coming months, gym-goers will increasingly look for great value and as the lowest-priced high quality gym operator we are well placed to meet this demand.'</p>

<p>Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said today: 'Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the aftereffects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down.</p>

<p>'If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead.'</p>

<p>Connor Campbell, an analyst at SpreadEx, said: 'Having sunk to 3-month lows on Tuesday thanks to pound-strength – or, rather, dollar weakness – the FTSE rebounded with a 100-point rise, pushing it across 5950.</p>

<p>'There were a few extra factors aiding the UK index, mind. Firstly, cable is down 0.3%, after significantly pulling back from its 2020 highs overnight.</p>

<p>'Then there was the small matter of UK house prices hitting record highs due to a combination of the easing of lockdown and the stamp duty holiday.</p>

<p>'This meant the FTSE’s housebuilders gave the index some extra juice – Berkeley Group rose 3%, with Taylor Wimpey climbing 3.2%, Persimmon jumping 3.5% and Barratt Developments up 5.3%.'</p>

<p>Housebuilder Barratt Developments has scrapped a special dividend to save cash due to the uncertainty caused by Covid as it built 30 per cent fewer homes and profits almost halved in the last financial year.</p>

<p>The company, which was supposed to hand investors the special £175million payout in November next year, said it will only pay the dividend when 'the time is right'.</p>

<p>Britain's biggest housebuilder built 12,034 homes in the year to the end of June, compared to 17,111 in 2019 as as construction work ground to a halt during lockdown.  </p>

<p>Pre-tax profit dropped 46 per cent to £491.8million on revenue of £3.42billion, a 28 per cent fall. But its order book stood at 15,660 homes, a 25 per cent rise compared to 13,064 homes last year. </p>

<p>Shares are up 6 per cent at 534p. </p>

<p>Guy Harrington, chief executive of Glenhawk, said: 'The speed of the market’s recovery is almost jaw dropping, with the recent stamp duty holiday and whimsical consumer behaviour seemingly turbo charging a market that looks increasingly disconnected from economic reality.</p>

<p>'The government money train cannot go on forever however. The end of furlough, which will be the trigger for winter of pain for millions, is imminent, and that’s before we even factor in a second spike.</p>

<p>'The market looks dangerously close to bubble territory; it’s a matter of if, not when, it bursts.'</p>

<p>Andrew Montlake, managing director at mortgage broker Coreco, said: ''Two words: reality check. As strong as the property market is right now, it will not last.</p>

<p>'Demand is understandably strong after lockdown and the added bonus of the stamp duty holiday, but unemployment is rising by the day and the economic outlook is highly uncertain as the furlough scheme ends.</p>

<p>'In the final months of the year we will start to see a reversal in the current rate of house price growth, as the true impact of Covid-19 on the economy shows through.</p>

<p>'On a positive note, there are many people whose lives and jobs are largely untouched by the pandemic who will continue to move home even as the broader economic picture deteriorates.</p>

<p>'What we’re also seeing is a huge amount of people looking for a second property or holiday home.</p>

<p>'The Stamp Duty holiday has spurred more landlords into action, too, while mortgage rates in this sector of the market have never been as cheap.</p>

<p>'For first time buyers, sadly, the stamp duty holiday is largely academic as lenders are struggling to provide the mortgage finance. If lenders can improve in this area, that will provide additional support to the market.'</p>

<p>Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club, said: 'The EY ITEM Club suspects the current pick-up in activity and firming of prices will prove unsustainable due to challenging fundamentals for consumers.</p>

<p>'Many people have already lost their jobs, despite the supportive Government measures, while others will be concerned that they may still end up losing their job once the furlough scheme ends.</p>

<p>'Additionally, many incomes have been affected. Consumer confidence is still low compared to long-term norms and many people are likely to remain cautious for some time to come when making major spending decisions such as buying or moving house.</p>

<p>'The EY ITEM Club suspects that the housing market is likely to come under pressure over the final months of 2020 when there is likely to be a significant rise in unemployment as the furlough scheme draws to a close in October.</p>

<p>'This will not only adversely affect the fundamentals for house buyers, but also likely fuel caution on committing to buying a house.</p>

<p>'There is also likely to be a fading of the pent-up demand effect on activity. Consequently, the EY ITEM Club predicts that the housing market will come under downward pressure late on in 2020.'</p>

<p>The cost of a house in the UK rose by a little over £3,000 in August as the property market hit new highs.</p>

<p>House-buyers have shrugged off continued uncertainty in the economy and social distancing to send the average price of a home to £224,123.</p>

<p>The 2 per cent rise in August of £3,188 wiped out the losses made earlier this year as the pandemic tore through the country, according to data from building society Nationwide.</p>

<p>It is also the highest rise in a single month since February 2004, when prices jumped 2.7 per cent.</p>

<p>'The bounce-back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions,' Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said. </p>
