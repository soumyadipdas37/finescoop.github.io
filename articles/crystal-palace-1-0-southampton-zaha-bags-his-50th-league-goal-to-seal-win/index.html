        <p>Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace got their 2020/21 campaign off to a winning start in a gritty encounter against Southampton.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for a very familiar feeling to settle around Selhurst Park, as Andros Townsend flighted a cross to the back post for talisman Wilfried Zaha to rattle home on the half-volley.</p>

<p>The second half brought little of note, save for referee Jon Moss consulting the pitch-side monitor to reverse his decision to award Kyle Walker-Peters a straight red card.</p>

<p>Zaha had the ball in the back of the net once again on 80 minutes, though was judged to be marginally offside with his shoulder. </p>

<p>Match report to follow </p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha once again popped up with the goods for Crystal Palace with the opening goal</p>

<p>Alex McCarthy was left helpless as Zaha pulled off a tidy finish on the half-volley</p>

<p>Zaha was congratulated by his team-mates after breaking the deadlock inside Selhurst</p>

<p>Kyle Walker-Peters was sent off for a high foot, only for VAR to reduce the foul to a yellow card</p>

<p>Referee Jon Moss followed new protocol and checked the pitchside VAR monitor himself</p>

<p>Danny Ings kept plugging away up front as Southampton looked to get back into the contest</p>

<p>Both teams warmed up inside the empty stadium, with fans still not permitted to attend</p>

<p>Coronavirus measures are still be taken, with disinfectant sprayed around prior to kick-off</p>

<p>Scroll below to relive how the action unfolded, kick by kick with Sportsmail's KIERAN JACKSON. </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Thanks for joining us for coverage of Crystal Palace's win against Southampton on the opening day... </p>

<p>Switch over now for live coverage of champions Liverpool taking on Leeds! </p>

<p>Palace get the win on the opening day! </p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha's early volley is enough to separate the sides here - three points for Roy Hodgson's side!</p>

<p>Southampton, though dominant with the ball, didn't do enough with it ultimately... </p>

<p>And Danny Ings almost makes Zaha pay!</p>

<p>Walker-Peters' first time volley across the box is met by the head of Ings, but his header is straight at Guaita, who parries it away!</p>

<p>Drama at the end... </p>

<p>And Zaha should seal it!</p>

<p>He sprints past Stephens as if he isn't there, but can only find the side-netting from close range - when he really should have scored! </p>

<p>With the game now stretched, Palace suddenly have more of the ball!</p>

<p>It doesn't look like it's going to be Southampton's day here... </p>

<p>SIX MINUTES OF ADDED TIME... </p>

<p>Can Southampton find an equaliser? </p>

<p>Saints skipper Ward-Prowse goes for glory again outside the box, but it's well over the bar from 30 yards out!</p>

<p>Time running out for the visitors now... </p>

<p>Last roll of the dice from Ralph Hasenhüttl - Shane Long comes on for Che Adams. </p>

<p>The decision is indeed offside!</p>

<p>Zaha timed his run near-perfectly, but was leaning just offside! His finish, though, through on goal was clinical into the corner... yet Southampton are still in it in the closing stages! </p>

<p>Zaha's goal disallowed for offside! It's very, very tight... the Palace man may be leaning just offside. </p>

<p>VAR review once again... </p>

<p>A debut for new signing Eberechi Eze! He comes on for Jeffrey Schlupp. </p>

<p>Schlupp does well down the left to win a corner for Palace, and McArthur has a free header in the box - but can't get his effort on target!</p>

<p>Saints make their second change - Will Smallbone comes off for Moussa Djenepo out wide. </p>

<p>Palace captain Luka Milivojević replaces James McCarthy in the centre of the park.</p>

<p>Ward-Prowse does indeed go for goal, but Guaita sees it comfortably over the bar... </p>

<p>Southampton pushing and pushing here... Palace unable to keep hold of the ball here. </p>

<p>They have a free-kick, just outside the box here. James Ward-Prowse territory from out wide... </p>

<p>Good ball into the middle by Smallbone isn't dealt with, and it falls to Adams who goes down in the box - no penalty though! </p>

<p>The Southampton forward looked more like he stumbled there... visitors still pushing for an equaliser though! </p>

<p>Not a bad opening that for Palace!</p>

<p>Schlupp's surge down the left can't find Ayew or Zaha in the middle, who perhaps didn't make the run required... </p>

<p>A rare attacking foray for the hosts! </p>

<p>James McCarthy gets a booking after catching James Ward-Prowse out on the left... </p>

<p>Southampton fully in control now, Palace relatively deep already too! </p>

<p>What a save by Guaita!</p>

<p>Che Adams pounces on a header down and his powerful volley is very well saved by the Palace keeper, who claws it away... </p>

<p>Well, well, well...</p>

<p>Referee Jon Moss is instructed to go and have a look at the incident on the pitchside monitor (something I expect we'll see more of this season) and decides to change his decision to a yellow card!</p>

<p>Right decision found in the end! Kyle Walker Peters catches Mitchell on the end of the toe, but there's no excessive force. He stays on the pitch... </p>

<p>Kyle Walker-Peters is sent-off!</p>

<p>It's a bouncing ball, but the Southampton right back catches the Tyrick Mitchell...</p>

<p>VAR check ongoing. </p>

<p>Southampton have come straight out the blocks here in the second-half!</p>

<p>Nathan Redmond has a shot at goal from the left but it's straight at Guaita, while Kyle Walker-Peters' cross from the right after a surging run can't quite find a Saints body in the middle. </p>

<p>A change for Southampton at the break - centre back Jan Bednarek comes off for Jannik Vestergaard.</p>

<p>3 - Southampton have won their last three away Premier League visits to Crystal Palace without conceding a single goal; Saints have never won four consecutive away top-flight matches against an opponent. Opportunity. #CRYSOU pic.twitter.com/mMY97zPn2y</p>

<p>Palace have the lead at the break!</p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha's volley the difference between the two sides - his 50th league goal in English football!</p>

<p>Southampton started strongly but no doubt faded as Palace looked comfortable as the half wore on - plenty for the visitors to think about at the interval! </p>

<p>TWO MINUTES OF ADDED TIME</p>

<p>One of the last chances of the half for Southampton from a corner, but Palace manage to clear their lines. </p>

<p>Not too sure why, but just had confirmation that Crystal Palace's Jeffrey Schlupp has picked up a yellow card...</p>

<p>Southampton's Will Smallbone gets the wrong side of Tyrick Mitchell and tumbles over in the box - looks more a coming together really, no penalty! </p>

<p>No VAR review either. </p>

<p>Brilliant whipped free-kick in by Townsend but Cheikhou Kouyate can only get a toe on it - and the flag is up! </p>

<p>Again, very high line by Southampton... </p>

<p>Southampton's main man Danny Ings is working hard - the England international attempts a diving header at the near post but can't quite get the power on it, and it's comfortable for Guaita in goal. </p>

<p>Palace come close from a corner!</p>

<p>The driven ball in is met well by Scott Dann, who forces McCarthy to get down low to his left and parry the ball away! </p>

<p>Jordan Ayew, in front of the keeper, is then given offside. </p>

<p>Palace have stemmed the flow here and appear quite comfortable, despite their lack of the ball... tad bitty in the last five minutes or so. </p>

<p>50 - Wilfried Zaha's opener for Crystal Palace was his 50th goal in league football (excluding play-offs). Super. #CRYSOU pic.twitter.com/C1KQo3RSN9</p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha is off the mark for the new season 🙌Picked out by Andros Townsend as Palace strike on the counter-attack 🔵🔴 pic.twitter.com/FCIpvzarUn</p>

<p>Southampton are taking a chance in general play here - their defensive line is extremely high, and so far Palace have benefited from that space in behind! </p>

<p>That being said, Saints continue to control the ball - no way through yet though. </p>

<p>Against the run of play, Palace open the scoring!</p>

<p>Andros Townsend finds some space down the right, and his cross to the back post is perfect for Wilfried Zaha, whose volley is clincal - past Alex McCarthy before he has time to react at his near post!</p>

<p>Saints have dominated the ball, but have been caught on the counter there... Hodgson's men a goal up!  </p>

<p>Stephens, gingerly, looks all OK to continue.</p>

<p>Early concern for Southampton centre back Jack Stephens here, who is down clutching his knee after a tackle...</p>

<p>A small glimpse for Danny Ings on the edge of the box, but he can't quite latch onto the layoff and Guaita collects... </p>

<p>Visitors have started the stronger here!</p>

<p>First opening for Southampton. James Ward-Prowse whips the ball in, and Jack Stephens gets his head on it but it's comfortably saved by Vicente Guaita. </p>

<p>The visitors get us underway at Selhurst Park! </p>

<p>Crystal Palace: Guaita, Ward, Kouyate, Dann, Mitchell, Townsend, McArthur, McCarthy, Schlupp, Zaha, Ayew</p>

<p>Southampton: McCarthy, Walker-Peters, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Smallbone, Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Redmond, Adams, Ings</p>

<p>Palace in their usual red-and-blue shirts, with Southampton in their away kit of white with a red stripe across the shirt - reminiscent of Peru at the 2018 World Cup I believe! </p>

<p>Arsenal cruised to a 3-0 victory against newly-promoted Fulham at Craven Cottage.</p>

<p>Here's Rob Draper's match report, from Craven Cottage: </p>
