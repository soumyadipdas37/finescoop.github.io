        <p>Mariah Carey has revealed that meeting Derek Jeter in the 1990s served as 'a catalyst' for the end of her first marriage. </p>

<p>When she started her affair with the baseball heartthrob, the 50-year-old songbird was married to the music executive who discovered her, Tommy Mottola, 71.</p>

<p>Now in an Oprah Conversations clip obtained by People she dished about her relationship with Derek which inspired 'a few songs' in her repertoire.</p>

<p>Throwback: Mariah Carey has revealed that meeting Derek Jeter served as 'a catalyst' for the end of her first marriage to Tommy Mottola, whom she is pictured with in 1997</p>

<p>Candid: Now in an Oprah Conversations clip obtained by People she dished about her relationship with Derek which inspired 'a few songs' in her repertoire</p>

<p>'He was a catalyst that helped me get out of that relationship, because I had believed that there was somebody else,' she shared. </p>

<p>'It was the racial situation. You know, his mom is Irish. His dad is black,' said Mariah, who also had an Irish American mother and black father.</p>

<p>'But he was also very ambiguous looking to me. I didn’t know who he was,' explained the All I Want For Christmas Is You singer.</p>

<p>'We met and I’ve written songs about it, and honestly, I don’t think it was like: "Oh my gosh, he was the love of my li-" like, at the time I did, because I didn’t think I would ever meet anybody who wouldn’t, what’s the word?' she mused.</p>

<p>The look of love: Mariah is pictured with Derek at Puff Daddy's birthday in 1998, more than a year after her separation from Tommy</p>

<p>'I used the word, and I just thought about this last night. Not look down on, but feel superior to me for – because of the fact that I’m not one way or the other in most people’s minds, and they have preconceived notions, whatever.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'But he was a catalyst, and I think that it was beautiful, and his family was a healthy family and they changed my viewpoint that: "Oh, it’s because of the biracial situation that my family’s so screwed up," as opposed to: "It’s them."</p>

<p>Mariah confessed that 'yes, those things did play a huge part in their dysfunction, but it was healthy for me to see a functional family, that, you know, basically kind of looked like mine but didn’t feel like mine. And he was also living his dream job and doing his dream job and stuff, you know. I believe we connected in that way.'</p>

<p>In a recent Vulture interview she admitted that the romance with Derek began during her first marriage, which lasted from 1993 to 1998.</p>

<p>Sadie, Sadie: In a recent Vulture interview she admitted that the romance with Derek began during her first marriage; she and Derek are pictured at their New York wedding in 1993</p>

<p>The singing sensation also revealed that The Roof and My All, two songs from her 1997 album Butterfly, were about the baseball sex symbol.</p>

<p>She shared in an excerpt of her upcoming memoir The Meaning Of Mariah that she and Derek were introduced at a dinner party, beginning a 'text-flirting' exchange. </p>

<p>Mariah secretly met Derek on the rooftop of his building - hence The Roof - and they drank Moet and kissed in the rain.</p>

<p>'I mean, it’s not like it was some intensely deep, intellectually stimulating - again, it was a great moment, and it happened in a divine way because it helped me get past living there, in Sing Sing, under those rules and regulations,' she spilled.</p>

<p>Side by side: Mariah evidently felt excessively penned in by Tommy, judging by the fact that in her memoir she refers to their marital home as 'Sing Sing' after the infamous prison</p>

<p>The music legend was discovered in the late 1980s by her first ex-husband Tommy Mottola who was then head of Columbia Records.</p>

<p>However it was only in the early 1990s when she was recording her third album Music Box that she reportedly took up with him.</p>

<p>Mariah evidently felt excessively penned in by Tommy, judging by the fact that in her memoir she refers to their marital home as 'Sing Sing' after the infamous prison.</p>

<p>During a Cosmopolitan interview last year she dished that she has only been with five men and shed some light on her first marriage. </p>

<p>New horizons: Mariah told Oprah that Derek 'was a catalyst that helped me get out of that relationship, because I had believed that there was somebody else'</p>

<p>'You might want to picture a child bride,' she said of her dynamic with Tommy, who was more than two decades her senior.</p>

<p>'There was a conscious effort to keep me as this all-American, whatever that means, girl. It was very controlled. There was no ­freedom for me as a human being. It was almost like being a prisoner,' said Mariah.</p>

<p>From 2008 until 2016 she was married to Nick Cannon, with whom she amicably co-parents her nine-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan.</p>

<p>After that divorce she had a failed engagement to Australian billionaire James Packer and is now dating her former backup dancer Bryan Tanaka.</p>

<p>The way they were: From 2008 until 2016 she was married to Nick Cannon, with whom she amicably co-parents her nine-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan; they are pictured in 2009</p>

<p>Mariah was only three when her own parents divorced, but while they were together the family experienced bigotry over her father's race.</p>

<p>Her neighbors in Long Island reportedly set their car alight and poisoned their dog, according to a 2010 profile in The Guardian.</p>

<p>Three years after her parents divorced she was visiting Alfred and brought along her best friend, a white girl whom Mariah recalled panicked upon seeing him.</p>

<p>Three generations: Mariah is pictured with her mother Patricia and daughter Monroe when her little girl was only two years old</p>

<p>'She got out of the car and went up the stairs to his house and he was over 6ft tall and very handsome, but to her he must have really been scary because I don't know that she'd ever seen a black man before. And she looked at him, her mouth went open and she started screaming and crying,' she said.</p>

<p>.I think he was trying to make me feel better and calm her down, but it didn't work. You never know what people say in their houses about different races. So my mother took her home and I went up the stairs with my father.'</p>

<p>Last year she told Billboard that her mother's 'Irish family disowned us' because of Patricia's marriage to a black man in the 1960s.</p>
