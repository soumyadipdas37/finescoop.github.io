    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>A former Tory party activist who produced Brexit: The Movie has been convicted of lying to secure a £519,000 loan - but will only have to pay back £85.72.</p>

<p>David Shipley was jailed for three years and nine months in February for fraudulently gaining investment by photoshopping his bank statements to inflate his earnings. </p>

<p>Shipley had approached Dragons' Den entrepreneur James Caan's business, Resourcing Capital Ventures, for a loan of £519,000 in 2014, of which £327,600 was paid.</p>

<p>His 'Dragons' Den style pitch' was for his corporate finance recruitment firm Spitfire Capital Advisors Ltd, which he had set up with two others.</p>

<p>David Shipley (above) must only pay back £85.72 in compensation after photoshopping his bank statements to inflate his income and obtain a loan </p>

<p>But Judge Martin Griffith said that he lied on his P60 form to gain the confidence of backers, with his true income standing at £19,928, not £377,000.</p>

<p>At a hearing on Monday, Shipley agreed to benefiting £327,600 but will only have to pay £85.72 back as compensation - his total amount of available assets. </p>

<p>Hunter Dubose, managing director of Spitfire Capital Advisors, reportedly burst out laughing when Judge Martin Griffith asked: 'The whole £85.72 or are you going to split it?'</p>

<p>Shipley appeared at the hearing via video link from Wandsworth Prison and only spoke to confirm his name. </p>

<p>He has 30 days to pay the £85.72 to Resourcing Capital Ventures, with a default prison sentence of seven days.</p>

<p>Shipley was a leading voice in the campaign for Britain to pull out of the EU, and was one of the people behind the pro-Leave film, which featured Nigel Farage and David Davis.</p>

<p>The movie came out a month before the 2016 referendum.</p>

<p>Sentencing Shipley in February, Judge Martin Griffith said his actions were 'a blatant piece of dishonesty'.  </p>

<p>Shipley previously appeared at Southwark Crown Court in a smart blue suit and remained expressionless as he was jailed for three years and nine months.</p>

<p>Shipley approached Dragons' Den entrepreneur James Caan's business, Resourcing Capital Ventures, for a loan of £519,000 in 2014, of which £327,600 was paid</p>

<p>He has undergone extensive tests for an undiagnosed illness in his throat and was recently awaiting the results for an MRI scan on his bowel.</p>

<p>Gareth Munday, prosecuting, earlier told the court: 'Between 2011 and June 2014 Mr Shipley was employed by a firm specialising in financial recruitment.</p>

<p>'He worked to place people in employment within a financial institution. After leaving, he proposed a new business venture which was a recruitment and financial advice firm.</p>

<p>'In order to fund the start up of the business he sought funding from the company Resourcing Capital Ventures.</p>

<p>'It was a Dragon's Den style pitch.'</p>

<p>Shipley was asked to prove his own income which would also be used to finance the business, as well as proving his expertise in financial recruitment.</p>

<p>'With his P60 he had shown his salary as £377,000 and in his bank statements, showing he had just received £540,000 into his bank account which he said was from commissions,' Mr Munday said.</p>

<p>'On that assurance they agreed to fund Spitfire and it was created.</p>

<p>'However the bank statements and the P60 were false. He later admitted that he photoshopped the documents but denied that he had done anything wrong.'</p>

<p>Mr Munday told the court his salary was less than £60,000, describing Shipley as an underachiever.</p>

<p>The producer of Brexit: The Movie, featuring Nigel Farage (above), has been convicted of lying to secure a £519,000 loan - but will only have to pay back £85.72</p>

<p>He said: 'Between the years of 2011 and 2014 the only commission he had earned was £19,928.</p>

<p>'Essentially he had not placed people and he had in fact left his previous employment over a cloud. He had failed to turn up for his employment and when asked he said his dad had died.</p>

<p>'The company found out about the lie when they phoned his house to express their condolences and spoke to his father.'</p>

<p>'When interviewed by police Mr Shipley said he had not done anything wrong, simply photoshopped his statements, it was a white lie.'</p>

<p>Benjamin Narain, defending, said the Tory activist showed genuine remorse.</p>

<p>'He felt guilt and embarrassment, he is genuinely sorry for being involved in this offence.</p>

<p>He accepts the forged bank statements and P60 were wrong,' he said.</p>

<p>'However all losses from this business do not stem from that fraud.</p>

<p>'Losses happen because businesses fail but it did not fail solely because of Mr Shipley.' </p>

<p>But reading a statement from a representative of RCV, Judge Martin Griffith said: 'This man said that without the bank statements we would not have touched him with a barge pole.</p>

<p>'They say they would not have even taken the meeting.'</p>

<p>David Shipley (above) was sentenced to three years and nine months imprisonment and disqualified from being a director for seven years in February after the con</p>

<p>Mr Narain had urged the court to 'read between the lines' and consider that Shipley was in 'a lot of pain.'</p>

<p>'He had an MRI on Tuesday for a bowel problem, he has seen several doctors and in his experience with the NHS they have been quick,' Mr Narain said.</p>

<p>'We can read between the lines here but he is in a lot of pain, using the bathroom in double figures, often needing to shower and wash himself afterwards.'</p>

<p>Mr Narain added that Shipley's career in politics was over forever.</p>

<p>The judge told Shipley: 'I have to deal with you gross dishonesty carried out by you in 2014. I have heard the position of Mr Dubose and I have absolutely no doubt that he regrets being involved with you.</p>

<p>'In 2014 a business was proposed called Spitfire and it involves you and Mr Dubose and another going into the business in which you said you were very qualified.</p>

<p>'Resourcing Capital Ventures was contacted to put a loan not surprisingly they asked for evidence of income. You photoshopped a P60 form showing you had an income of £377,000 and a bank statement of £540,000 which you said was for commission from your last job.'</p>

<p>He added that the true commission had actually been £19,928.74 over three years and claimed that if he has told the RVCV the truth then the idea of a loan would not have been entertained.</p>

<p>'You were interviewed when the truth came out and maintained that when you photo-shopped those documents was a white lie.</p>

<p>'It must have been perfectly clear to you that that was a load of old rubbish. You must have known you were guilty of the offence.</p>

<p>Shipley (above) had been asked to prove his income and lied about his salary in order to secure the loan for his company Spitfire Capital Advisors Ltd</p>

<p>'You pleaded guilty and that resulted in a loss of discount because your guilty plea was not entered at the first opportunity.'</p>

<p>He added that Mr Shipley had requested that amount of money and that he would have been going into business with people that trusted him.</p>

<p>'You applied for a loan of £519,000 and the starting point is five years imprisonment. As far as I'm concerned medical reports show that you're perfectly well for me to sentence to custody.</p>

<p>'Thank heavens you haven't got a [serious medical condition] and we've found that out now.</p>

<p>'Your possible political career has now gone well there we are, that's what happens when you commit an offence of dishonesty.'</p>

<p>He added that Mr Shipley had been 'blatantly dishonest'.</p>

<p>Shipley, from Buckinghamshire, admitted one count of fraud by false representation.</p>

<p>A further count of fraud by abuse of position was ordered to lie on file.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to three years and nine months imprisonment and disqualified from being a director for seven years.</p>
