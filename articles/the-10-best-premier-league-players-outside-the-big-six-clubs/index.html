    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>The Premier League's big six boast the majority of the top flight's stars but it is safe to say there is plenty of talent outside the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham.</p>

<p>Premier League Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy is a prime example of the quality on the books at the so-called smaller clubs, with the likes of Danny Ings, Allan Saint-Maximin and Richarlison among the many other players who could easily fit in among the big boys. </p>

<p>Here is Sportsmail's verdict as to who are the 10 best players outside of the top six clubs that have the potential to shine brightest this season.   </p>

<p>Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy is a prime example of the talent on show at 'smaller' clubs</p>

<p>Burnley achieved a better defensive record than fourth-placed Chelsea last year, having conceded four less goals than Frank Lampard's men. Credit, of course, is due to Nick Pope who has impressed between the sticks for the club.  </p>

<p>Pope boasts the second-highest number of clean sheets among goalkeepers last season at 15, just one behind Manchester City’s Ederson.</p>

<p>Nick Pope boasts the second highest number of clean sheets in the top flight last season</p>

<p>England’s No 1 goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, kept just nine clean sheets last season. Having failed to hit the heights expected of him, fans are calling for Pickford to be replaced by Pope.</p>

<p>Pope also had a 71.3 save percentage last season, and another stat that backs up his credentials is the fact that he has made a total of 120 saves compared to Pickford’s comparatively lowly 94.</p>

<p>Jack Grealish has established himself as the undisputed leader of Aston Villa after rescuing them from relegation with a late goal against West Ham on the final day of last season. Even before then, Grealish has been tipped for very big things.</p>

<p>A move to one of the Premier League's top clubs must surely soon be on the cards after the 24-year-old impressed for Aston Villa last season, ultimately leading to his first England cap this week.</p>

<p>Jack Grealish created more chances per game last season than Bruno Fernandes</p>

<p>Working as the heart and soul of Villa, Grealish created 2.6 chances per game in the Premier League last season despite playing for a side that finished 17th in the table.  </p>

<p>Such statistics outperform that of Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United – a club that are vying for Grealish's signature - and Kevin De Bruyne was the only player to have created more chances for team-mates from open play. </p>

<p>The Villa man is confident going forwards and earned an average of 4.9 fouls a game – the highest in the league's history for a single season. Should the midfielder feature in a team with real quality at set pieces, this could in turn be a real asset. </p>

<p>One key to the playmaker's success comes from diligence. He told The Athletic: 'I know in advance the player I'm coming up against in the next game, whether they will be strong, fast, easy to get at, technically good or bad.</p>

<p>'If I'm up against a fast, strong player, I change my game. I move it quicker and play one-twos to get around him.'</p>

<p>Danny Ings would not look out of place at any of the top six clubs in the Premier League after his impressive 2019-20 campaign with Southampton.</p>

<p>Ings scored 22 Premier League goals last season, leaving him just one behind Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy. But, if you exclude penalties, the Saints striker actually outscored every other player in the Premier League by two goals.</p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Raheem Sterling and Jamie Vardy would all come in second on 19 goals.</p>

<p>Danny Ings scored 22 goals last season, leaving him just one behind Vardy</p>

<p>Ings has not only established himself as a top-class striker due to his finishing but also his ability to press the ball in the final third. His relentless work-rate has seen him become the third most successful player in the Premier League at winning possession in the final third – sitting just behind Roberto Firmino and his own team-mate Nathan Redmond.</p>

<p>Ings played under Gareth Southgate at England Under-21 level and is now back in the full squad, hoping to continue his fine form on the international stage in the coming years.</p>

<p>In his first season at Newcastle, Allan Saint-Maximin captured not only the heart of the manager but also the fans.</p>

<p>The winger's style of football is one that sees supporters rise to their feet as he drives through the opposition, showcasing his skill. Not only does the 23-year-old progress up the pitch in style, he can also deliver in front of goal.</p>

<p>Newcastle's win percentage jumped from 7.7 to 58.3 when Allan Saint-Maximin played</p>

<p>Some of Saint-Maximin's highlights include his extra-time FA Cup winner against Oxford United and also the goal that the squad believed sealed safety in March at Southampton.</p>

<p>Saint-Maximin had a greater positive influence on his team's win-rate than any other Premier League player last season. The club's win percentage jumped from 7.7 to 58.3 when Saint-Maximin was present in Steve Bruce's starting XI.</p>

<p>Richarlison has done nothing but prove his worth since joining Everton. The Toffees talisman has scored more goals for Everton than any other player in the time since he joined from Watford in 2018.</p>

<p>He is just one of two players under 25 to have scored more than 20 goals over the last two seasons – the other being Manchester United star Marcus Rashford.</p>

<p>Richarlison has scored more goals for Everton than any other player since joining from Watford</p>

<p>His goalscoring record alone cements his place among the best players in the league, but Richarlison provides much more than just his ability to find the net.</p>

<p>Last season he dribbled past more opponents and created more chances than he did in the previous campaign, and created four times more chances for Everton.</p>

<p>The Brazilian also possess the ability to influence a game defensively, having completed more tackles than any other Premier League forward last season.</p>

<p>In general forwards get a bad rap for their inability to tackle back, but Richarlison defies all odds as the majority of his tackles have come inside his own half. </p>

<p>John Egan has experienced a meteoric rise after joining Sheffield United from Brentford back in 2018.</p>

<p>Pundits across English and Irish media have been praising the man from Cork for his rapid adjustment to the English top flight as he continues to demonstrate moments of individual excellence.</p>

<p>John Egan completed more tackles with a higher success rate that Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk </p>

<p>Egan is a dominating defender that commands the air – winning a total of 134 aerial battles last season.</p>

<p>Not only is Egan leading the pack in that statistic, he also conceded fewer goals than Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk while also completing more tackles and with a higher success rate.</p>

<p>Sheffield United finished last season with the fourth-best defensive record in the league and it is clear Egan was undoubtedly vital to their success. </p>

<p>Tyrone Mings' arrival at Villa Park was transformative to the club’s defensive structure. In his first season, Ming’s helped Dean Smith’s side complete a club-record run of 10 consecutive wins - rising from 10th in the Championship to finish the season promoted as play-off winners.</p>

<p>Since then, his impressive displays have seen him earn a place in the England squad.</p>

<p>Tyrone Mings blocked the most shots of any Premier League defender last season </p>

<p>Although Mings may not have the highest tackle rate in the English top-flight, he led the charge on blocked shots last season.</p>

<p>Such spatial awareness and defensive positioning is an asset to the Villa defence, causing Smith to use Mings as a deeper shield in their back line.</p>

<p>He is also a fine player on the ball, helping build attacks from the back. </p>

<p>After developing under Nuno Espirito Santo, Wolves forward Adama Traore could feature for any of the Premier League giants without looking out of place.</p>

<p>Having initially looked out of place when he arrived in England with Aston Villa in 2015, the speedster delivered a series of impressive performances last season – scoring four goals and providing nine assists in 31 league games.</p>

<p>Traore's ability to burst forward has caused plenty of upset for opposition defences, with the 24-year-old completing more take-ons than any other player in Europe's top five leagues last season.</p>

<p>Adama Traore completed more take-ons than any other player in European football last season</p>

<p>Traore bypassed his defender a total of 145 times in 28 Premier League games. There were only three other players who made it into triple figures last season. One being Wilfried Zaha (136) and the other two being Lionel Messi (118) and Jeremie Boga (106).</p>

<p>Traore has established at 75.3 per cent success rate when it comes to his explosive runs, beating his man 5.17 times per game on average. </p>

<p>Such attributes have led to a number of top European clubs vying for his signature.</p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha has always been a pleasure to watch in the Premier League, establishing himself as the best player in Crystal Palace's history.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that the 27-year-old has been the core reason Palace have remained in the Premier League for seven consecutive seasons after entering the English top-flight back in 2013. </p>

<p>In their 2018-2019 campaign the talisman winger excelled for the club, scoring 10 goals and registering five assists.</p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha has increased his all-round game and remains the talisman at Crystal Palace</p>

<p>Despite his 2019-20 record of only four goals, the forward has still excelled for Roy Hodgson and developed his own game, fulfilling a different role with trademark success.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old increased his number of crosses from 37 to 54, his interceptions from 10 to 15 and his attempted dribbles from 156 to 219.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that Zaha went from having the fifth-most touches in the squad to the first.</p>

<p>Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has previously highlighted Zaha's ability, saying: 'I think the impact he's had in the last few years in the Premier League has been phenomenal. His ability to create chances on his own is unique.'</p>

<p>The man with the Golden Boot, the striker who inspired the most incredible Premier League title triumph of all time, and the rags-to-riches footballer whose life story was so improbable that they (nearly) made a film about him.</p>

<p>Jamie Vardy needs little introduction, but what makes him continually more impressive is his ability to seemingly get even better, even at the age of 33. His lightning speed certainly shows no signs of slowing.</p>

<p>Last season's tally of 23 goals was the second most he had ever managed in one season, just one behind his previous record of 24 in Leicester's year of years. He also brought up his century of top-flight goals, with his record now a brilliant 103 in 211 games.</p>

<p>With Brendan Rodgers at the helm of a young and exciting team packed full of quality, the spearhead Vardy could yet have some of his best years still ahead of him.</p>
