        <p>Fifi Box pulled out of her popular radio show on Tuesday following the news that her daughters's half-sister Jaimi Kenny had died. </p>

<p>Jami, whose father Grant shares two daughters with comedian Fifi, lost her battle with an unspecified illness at age 33 on Monday. </p>

<p>Addressing the news during their The Fox 101.9 Melbourne breakfast show on Tuesday, Fifi's co-hosts Brendan Fevola and Byron Cooke said the show 'must go on' despite the profound tragedy.  </p>

<p>'Well Fi is away today but the show must go on,' Byron said. </p>

<p>'We're a team, we're one and one, we're going to mould into one and just nail it,' Brendan added, continuing: 'If we're in the Titanic, I've got my arms around you, I'll carry you bro.' </p>

<p>Fifi, who shared a close relationship with Jaimi, has not publicly commented about Jaimi's death.   </p>

<p>New chapter: In 2013, Jaimi's father Grant, 57, welcomed a daughter named Trixie Belle with radio presenter Fifi Box (right). Fifi - who had a close friendship with her ex's adult children, including Jaimi (left) - did not acknowledge Grant was the father of her daughter until 2016. Pictured in 2017</p>

<p>Doting half-sister: Jaimi previously babysat half-sister Trixie (pictured together in 2015) while single mother Fifi was at work. </p>

<p>Jaimi's three-time Olympian mother Lisa Curry and former Ironman Grant Kenny separated in 2009 after 23 years of marriage, before finalising their divorce in 2017. </p>

<p>In 2013, Grant, 57, welcomed a daughter named Trixie Belle with radio presenter Fifi, from whom he had split several months earlier. </p>

<p>Fifi, who had a close friendship with Jaimi, did not acknowledge Grant was the father of her daughter until 2016. </p>

<p>In May 2018, Lisa married entertainer Mark Tabone at their Sunshine Coast hinterland property.  </p>

<p>Devastated: Lisa Curry (right) has released a heartbreaking statement about the death of her daughter Jaimi (left), who lost her battle with a long-term illness on Monday at the age of 33</p>

<p>It comes after Lisa released a heartbreaking statement about the death of her daughter Jaimi on Tueday. </p>

<p>The 58-year-old former competitive swimmer spoke of her 'unbearable' pain in a gut-wrenching Instagram post on Tuesday. </p>

<p>'Our hearts are completely broken. Our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital yesterday morning with her loving family by her side,' Lisa began her post, which was interspersed with pink floral emojis - an ode to Jaimi's 'love of flowers'.</p>

<p>'Bright, caring and loving soul': The 58-year-old former competitive swimmer spoke of her 'unbearable' pain in a gut-wrenching Instagram post on Tuesday (above). Her post was interspersed with pink floral emojis - an ode to Jaimi's 'love of flowers'</p>

<p>Lisa's update comes just hours after her ex-husband, former Ironman Grant Kenny, announced that their 'caring, bright and loving' eldest child had died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital. The family hasn't revealed the exact cause of death.</p>

<p>Lisa continued: 'So loved. So beautiful. So kind to everyone... So painful. I can barely breathe.</p>

<p>'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself. Her love of flowers, cooking, art, decorating, photography, babies, the beach, and helping others will always be remembered.</p>

<p>'Our hearts are broken and the pain is unbearable but we cherish every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured and so loved first child.'</p>

<p>Tragedy: Lisa's update comes after her ex-husband, Grant Kenny, announced that their 'caring and loving' daughter had died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital on Monday morning. The family hasn't revealed the exact cause of death. Pictured: Lisa and Jaimi in an undated photo</p>

<p>Lisa thanked 'the paramedics, support staff and the incredible team' at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for the 'extra time we were able to spend with Jaimi'.</p>

<p>She added: 'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for our family and all who knew and loved Jaimi so very much.</p>

<p>'Rest in peace, my beautiful baby. I will miss you every sunrise, I will miss you when the sun is shining and the birds are singing. I will miss you when the clouds are dark and stormy and when the rainbow appears. I will miss you when I close my eyes. I will miss you when I open my eyes. I will miss our long hugs and long chats. I will miss watching, feeling and knowing your love for your sister and brother, your little nephew, Cleo, your Ma and dad.'</p>

<p>Lisa concluded: 'I just can't believe you're not here anymore. I sit and just shake my head. It doesn't seem real or right. You will forever be with me in my heart, Jaimi. I love you so much.'</p>

<p>Sad: 'Our hearts are broken and the pain is unbearable but we cherish every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured and so loved first child,' Lisa said </p>

<p>Lisa's husband, Elvis Presley impersonator Mark Tabone, also addressed the tragedy in an Instagram post on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'As the tears flow and the heart aches, I write this as a tribute to beautiful young lady, who's life ended way too soon,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'As your mother and father weep your loss, I too feel lost and heavy hearted. Nobody should ever lose their child. </p>

<p>'You always put everybody else first. You were gifted with many talents, amazing cook, arts and crafts, writing, and your love and creativity with flowers.'</p>

<p>He went on to thank the public for their condolences and said his 'job now is to nurture my wife through this unimaginable time'. </p>

<p>Pillar of support: He thanked the public for their condolences and said his 'job now is to nurture my wife through this unimaginable time'</p>

<p>Jaimi's younger brother Jett, 26, also addressed his tragic loss in an emotional Instagram post on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'I may not have been the best brother to you all the time, I know you thought you weren't being the big sister I needed all the time, but I do know we loved one another unconditionally all the time,' he wrote. </p>

<p>Shattered, the male model and lifesaver continued: 'I will love you forever. Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one. You will be dearly missed by all whose lives you touched.'  </p>

<p>'I will love you forever': Jaimi's (right) younger brother Jett, 26, (left) also addressed his tragic loss in an emotional Instagram post on Tuesday </p>

<p>Shattered: 'Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one. You will be dearly missed by all whose lives you touched',' Jett wrote </p>

<p>The Curry-Kenny family had confirmed Jaimi's death on Monday afternoon, releasing a statement in which they expressed their heartbreak and also asked the public to allow them to 'grieve in privacy'.</p>

<p>'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement, which was written by Jaimi's father, Grant.</p>

<p>'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.</p>

<p>Grieving: Jaimi (centre) is survived by her Ironman father, former pro swimmer mother (right), brother Jett (left) and sister Morgan</p>

<p>'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child.</p>

<p>'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us as the extra time we were able to spend with her.</p>

<p>'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'</p>

<p>Unclear: Neither the family's statement on Monday nor Lisa's Instagram update on Tuesday specified the exact nature of Jaimi's illness</p>

<p>Family ties: Lisa is pictured with her son Jett (left), surviving daughter Morgan (right) and her grandson Flynn</p>

<p>Jaimi had just turned 33 in June, with her mother taking to social media at the time to wish her a happy birthday. </p>

<p>'Our first born. Really... where have all those years gone! Have a lovely day bubba. We all love you so much,' Lisa wrote.</p>

<p>Jaimi is survived by her Ironman father, former pro swimmer mother, brother Jett and sister Morgan.</p>

<p>RIP: Jaimi is pictured as a child with her mother, a three-time Olympian and former swimmer</p>

<p>Gone too soon: Jaimi (pictured as a baby with her father, Grant) turned 33 in June</p>

<p>Neither statement revealed the nature of Jaimi's illness.</p>

<p>In November 2014 Jaimi made headlines after she was caught driving while more than four times over the legal alcohol level.    </p>

<p>She was fined $1200 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a license for 11 months.  </p>

<p>In the spotlight: Lisa is pictured with Jaimi after winning gold in the Womens 100 metres butterfly during the 1990 Commonwealth Games, Aukland, New Zealand </p>

<p>Jaimi's lawyer told the court that Ms Kenny had suffered from anxiety since the age of 14 and had contacted her psychiatrist prior to being stopped by police. </p>

<p>'The defendant admitted to police that she had an alcohol problem and that she sought help in relation to this,' Prosecutor Sergeant Leonie Scott said at the time.  </p>

<p>Co-parents: Lisa and Grant separated in 2009 after 23 years of marriage, before finalising their divorce in 2017. They are pictured with Jaimi on the Sunshine Coast on April 3, 2008</p>
