    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>A husband today told how he burned the body of a love rival for four and a half hours after allegedly shooting him dead over an affair with his wife.   </p>

<p>Andrew Jones, 53, is accused of murdering father-of-three Mike O'Leary, 55, with one of his eight guns before attempting to stage his death as suicide.</p>

<p>Businessman Jones allegedly 'lured' Mr O'Leary to his death at a remote farm by posing as his wife Rhianon, 51, and using her phone.</p>

<p>He is then accused of shooting Mr O'Leary with a .22 calibre Colt rifle and 'destroying' his body in a series of fires at his building yard.</p>

<p>Jones claims Mr O'Leary's death was an accident and he 'panicked' when the gun went off during a struggle.</p>

<p>Builder Andrew Jones, 52, is accused of killing father-of-three Mike O'Leary (pictured with his wife Sian), 55, with one of his eight guns before 'destroying' his body in a series of fires </p>

<p>He said he used an excavator digger to move Mr O'Leary's body onto wooden pallets and set it ablaze in a series of fires at his home.</p>

<p>Building and farming boss Jones, also a father-of-three, admitted to using electric fans to speed up the burning.</p>

<p>He told the jury: 'I got wooden pallets and piled them up. 'With the excavator I moved Mike and placed him on top of the pallet with the intention of starting a fire.</p>

<p>'I put cardboard packaging and papers around the pallets and got all the electric fans out.'</p>

<p>Jones (left), who ran building and farming companies, is alleged to have murdered Mr O'Leary over his affair with his wife Rhianon (right), 51 </p>

<p>The jury was warned texts between Mr O'Leary and mother-of-three Mrs Jones (pictured) contained 'intimate and graphic' messages</p>

<p>Jones told the jury he retrieved an old order of service from a funeral he'd been to so he could give a reading as he burned the body.</p>

<p>He said: 'I wanted to say a few words, because I can't remember the Lord's prayer off by heart, and then I lit the fire and went to sit in the car,</p>

<p>'I left the fire burn all the way down to the floor whilst sitting in the car.'</p>

<p>The jury heard Jones added more fuel to the fire over a four-and-a-half hour period.</p>

<p>Jones (right) is accused of using Rhiannon's (left) 'secret phone' to entice Michael O'Leary to the farm after discovering their fling</p>

<p>An extensive search (pictured) was carried out for Michael's body at the farm and forensics found small intestine tissue at the bottom of a rusty oil barrel</p>

<p>Jones, who ran building and farming companies, is accused of posing as his wife to 'lure' Mr O'Leary to a secret meeting at a secluded farm where he shot him dead.</p>

<p>A court heard he then dumped Mr O'Leary's car by a river to stage his disappearance as suicide - before making his getaway on bicycle.</p>

<p>The jury was told Jones shot Mr O'Leary at his secluded farm before using a fork lift truck to lift his body into the boot of his Audi A6 and driving it to his home where he burned it.</p>

<p>William Hughes QC said: 'Mike O'Leary was lured to this location expecting a private meeting with Rhianon Jones. Instead he was met by this defendant who was armed with a powerful rifle which he used to deliberately shoot him dead.</p>

<p>Mr O'Leary's wife Sian, pictured arriving at court on Monday, allegedly received a text from her husband saying: 'I'm so sorry X'</p>

<p>'Steps were subsequently taken to hide and cover up his crimes - not in panic but a clear and calculated approach.'</p>

<p>He added: 'This was a carefully planned and well though-out murder far from an accident.</p>

<p>'He had murder very much in mind.</p>

<p>'When Mike arrived he had the same intent to kill him when he shot him - this is no tragic accident'.</p>

<p>Jones and his daughter Carrie were monitoring Mrs Jones's (pictured) movements and phone calls after discovering she was cheating in September 2019, the court heard</p>

<p>The court heard a search of Jones' home found he had a collection of eight guns - including a.22 Colt rifle allegedly used to shoot Mr O'Leary.</p>

<p>Police also found jeans and trainers at Jones' house which had traces of Mr O'Leary's blood. </p>

<p>Mr Hughes said Jones claimed there was a 'scuffle' between the two men which led to Mr O'Leary (pictured) being shot in the head</p>

<p>Mr Hughes said: 'Andrew Jones said that while his wife was ill he had found her secret phone and messaged Mike O'Leary to meet.</p>

<p>'He said they got out of their cars and had strong words. Both men were upset. </p>

<p>'He said he last saw Mike when he left the farm in his vehicle. That account about him leaving the farm alive is a lie.' </p>

<p>Prosecutor Mr Hughes said that Jones claimed he 'wanted to threaten Mike and took with him a rifle with the intention of frightening Mike O'Leary.' </p>

<p>Mr Hughes said Jones told him that 'he did not envision harm coming to himself or Mike.</p>

<p>'He fired two or three shots into the ground with the intention of frightening him.' </p>

<p>Mr Hughes said Jones claimed there was a 'scuffle' between the two men which led to Mr O'Leary being shot in the head.</p>

<p>Jones claimed: 'The bullet went through his chin.'</p>

<p>Mr Hughes said: 'He says he does not know who caused the firearm to discharge. If he did cause it, he said, he did so accidentally.</p>

<p>'Mike died instantly and the defendant panicked.'</p>

<p>The court heard Jones admitted moving the body and the car and sending the text messages to Mr O'Leary's family. </p>

<p>The prosecution said Mr O'Leary (pictured) was lured to Jones's Cyncoed Farm, near Carmarthen, where the father-of-three expected to see his lover</p>

<p>He added that Jones then took Mr O'Leary's body back to his home where he burned it 'over several days' in a series of 'intense' fires in his building yard.</p>

<p>The court previously heard Jones killed Mr O'Leary after discovering he was having an affair with his wife.</p>

<p>Mr Hughes said: 'There was an affair between Michael O'Leary and Rhianon Jones. They attended the same gym and at some stage during 2019 they began an extra marital relationship.' </p>

<p>'Andrew Jones became aware of the affair in 2019 having read some messages on his wife's iPad.</p>

<p>Mr Hughes said the messages between Mr O'Leary and Mrs Jones were 'intimate and graphic in content'. </p>

<p>Jones, of Bronwydd, Carmarthen, denies murder.</p>

<p>The trial at Swansea Crown Court continues.</p>
