        <p>Helder Costa scored a brace as Leeds got their first Premier League win since their return with a 4-3 success at home to Fulham. </p>

<p>Costa put Leeds ahead with Fulham levelling through a penalty from Aleksandar Mitrovic.</p>

<p>Mateusz Klich's penalty restored Leeds' advantage, with Patrick Bamford and Costa then scoring. </p>

<p>Fulham sought to fight back, with Bobby Decordova-Reid and Mitrovic scoring, but Leeds held on to take all three points.  </p>

<p>More to follow...</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa is looking for his first Premier League win as Leeds host Fulham at 3pm</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Well after all that we're in need of a break before the next games come along. </p>

<p>That's all we've got time for in this Leeds live blog but follow the Sportsmail website for all the reaction to the 4-3 thriller and live action of Manchester United vs Crystal Palace and Arsenal vs West Ham United.</p>

<p>Have a good evening all!</p>

<p>Another seven-goal thriller today. Another 4-3 match involving Leeds. This time they're on the winning side.</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa's side have survived a major scare by Fulham, who fought back from 4-1 down to 4-3.</p>

<p>Helder Costa scored his first of the afternoon early on with both sides scoring penalties before the half through Aleksandar Mitrovic and Mateusz Klich.</p>

<p>But two goals in seven second-half minutes from Patrick Bamford and Costa put Leeds in firm control, or so they thought. Bobby Decordova-Reid and Mitrovic hauled the Cottagers back into the game but Bielsa's side held on for their first win of the season.</p>

<p>90 + 4 mins: Dennis Odoi strides through the Leeds midfield and fires an effort at goal. Over the bar. That might be that for the Cottagers.</p>

<p>90 + 2 mins: Marcelo Bielsa is barking orders at his Leeds players as they defend for their lives. Fulham have the ball in the Leeds half..</p>

<p>90 mins: We're going to have FOUR minutes of added time. Fulham need an equaliser..</p>

<p>85 mins: Nearly a way in for Leeds.</p>

<p>Mario Lemina gives the ball away in a very dangerous position on debut. Klich's through ball pass to Alioski is wayward though and Lemina is relieved.</p>

<p>How costly could that pass be?</p>

<p>80 mins: Ten minutes left. Neither side is creating anything towards the top end of the pitch.</p>

<p>Fulham biding their time though. They know chances will come their way due to Leeds' slack defending but must be careful about their own backline woes.</p>

<p>75 mins: End to end stuff here. Mitrovic nearly has a hat-trick but fires the ball straight into the ground and it's easy for Meslier.</p>

<p>At the other end, Jack Harrison runs down the left but fires over.</p>

<p>Pick a winner. I dare you.</p>

<p>74 mins: Leeds nearly put the game to bed once and for all.</p>

<p>Lovely team move as Tyler Roberts feeds Ezgjan Alioski who forces Areola into a good save. Roberts then pounces on the rebound but the Fulham shot stopper is there again.</p>

<p>70 mins: A change for Leeds as well. Patrick Bamford, who has been excellent this afternoon, comes off for Ezgjan Alioski.</p>

<p>70 mins: Final sub from Fulham as Mario Lemina, who used to play for Southampton, comes on for his Premier League debut for the Cottagers in place of Harrison Reed.</p>

<p>Can he make a dream debut with 20 minutes left to play?</p>

<p>69 mins: And we were nearly level just seconds later! </p>

<p>Neeskens Kebano shimmies inside the area and fires the ball towards Meslier's near post. The ball cannons off the post and Marcelo Bielsa can breathe a huge sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Mitrovic then heads wide just seconds later. Not quite the kitchen sink from Fulham but we're getting there!</p>

<p>68 mins: Game absolutely most definitely on!</p>

<p>This is a classic Aleksandar Mitrovic goal. The Serbian rises at the back post to head home Kenny Tete's cross past Meslier.</p>

<p>We've had so many goals today, can we have some more at Elland Road!</p>

<p>66 mins: Leeds come forward looking to establish their two-goal lead and win a free-kick.</p>

<p>Kalvin Phillips whips the ball in but Robin Koch heads just over the bar.</p>

<p>But wait...</p>

<p>62 mins: Now then. Maybe Fulham aren't done quite yet.</p>

<p>Frank Zambo Anguissa rides the challenge of Kalvin Phillips and plays in substitute Bobby Decordova-Reid, who takes a touch before slamming the ball past Meslier in the Leeds goal.</p>

<p>Inspired substitution by Scott Parker. Do they have enough time to get at least two more?</p>

<p>Double change from Scott Parker. Aboubakar Kamara and Josh Onomah are replaced by Neeskens Kebano and Bobby Decordova-Reid. </p>

<p>57 mins: Leeds look good. Really really good. And this is a lovely goal.</p>

<p>Patrick Bamford does brilliantly down the left hand side by running past Dennis Odoi before squaring the ball to Helder Costa.</p>

<p>The Portuguese midfielder hits a brilliant left-footed strike into the top corner. It's poor defending once again from Fulham but this is champagne football from Marcelo Bielsa's side.</p>

<p>53 mins: Fulham try to claw their way back into the game through captain Mitrovic but the Serbian's effort on goal from the edge of the area is too close to Illan Meslier. </p>

<p>It's a big ask for Scott Parker's side but there are still over 35 minutes remaining.</p>

<p>50 mins: What a start to the half from Leeds. What a terrible one for Fulham.</p>

<p>Mateusz Klich picks the ball up 40 yards from goal and plays a defence-splitting pass through to Patrick Bamford. </p>

<p>The tall striker shifts the ball onto his weaker right foot and curls a lovely effort past Areola in the Fulham goal.</p>

<p>It's a lovely finish from the forward, who like Klich has two goals in two games.</p>

<p>46: Half time sub for Leeds. Rodrigo, who was drafted into the team in the last minute for the injured Pablo Hernadez, is replaced by Tyler Roberts.</p>

<p>Injured? Or is Bielsa unimpressed?</p>

<p>Leeds get us underway again.</p>

<p>Both sides are heading back out for the second period. Can Fulham make a way back into the game again?</p>

<p>Plenty to think about for the defensive coaches of both teams. After their poor marking against Arsenal last week, Scott Parker's side gave away another set piece goal early on in this one - before some careless defending by Joe Bryan gave Leeds a penalty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Robin Koch has given away spot kicks in both of his Premier League appearances so far. Marcelo Bielsa can't be happy with the temperament his new German defender has shown. </p>

<p>What an afternoon of football we've had so far. Leeds and Fulham have produced an intense opening 45 minutes at Elland Road.</p>

<p>Helder Costa gave the Whites an early lead with a thumping effort inside the penalty area but Aleksandar Mitrovic's penalty levelled matters after Robin Koch's sloppy challenge on Joe Bryan.</p>

<p>Bryan then became the villain as he pushed Patrick Bamford in the area leaving Mateusz Klich to convert a spotkick just before the interval.</p>

<p>45+1 min: Harrison Reed lets fly from range but Meslier is there to block the shot. Good match this.</p>

<p>41 mins: Cool and composed from Mateusz Klich as he opens his body and taps the ball past Areola. </p>

<p>The midfielder scores for the second week in a row and Leeds have their lead back. </p>

<p>39 mins: Now a penalty for Leeds! A delicious cross from the left is heading towards Patrick Bamford but Joe Bryan shoves him in the back.</p>

<p>Clear penalty, now can Mateusz Klich convert?</p>

<p>37 mins: Now Fulham have their tails up. A loose ball falls to Mitrovic in the penalty and just as the striker prepared to shoot, Koch was there to step in and clear the ball away.</p>

<p>34 mins: Aleksandar Mitrovic steps up... and scores! Illan Meslier guesses the right way but it goes under his body.</p>

<p>33 mins: Joe Bryan tries to collect a ball near the byline and Robin Koch puts in a sloppy challenge and the defender goes down. Stonewall penalty.</p>

<p>30 mins: First sign of Aleksandar Mitrovic in the penalty area. Kenny Tete loops a cross towards the back post but the Serbian is penalised for a push as he prepared his leap towards the ball.</p>

<p>25 mins: Robin Koch sprays a lovely ball through to Patrick Bamford who is clear down the right but Dennis Odoi recovers to clear the ball.</p>

<p>From the resulting corner, Koch hammers a header towards goal but Alphonse Areola shows good athleticism to tip the effort over the bar.</p>

<p>20 mins: Frank Zambo Anguissa puts a dangerous ball over the Leeds defence for Aboubakar Kamara, but Illan Meslier is out to meet it.</p>

<p>The Cottagers seeing more of the ball now.</p>

<p>Here's how Helder Costa put Leeds in front at Elland Road this afternoon.</p>

<p>It's a great hit and the midfielder managed to catch it sweetly. But where were the Fulham defenders? </p>

<p>Wow 😳Helder Costa caught that one perfectly and Leeds are in front!No chance for Areola! pic.twitter.com/VWrnSM46gx</p>

<p>13 mins: Finally, something from Fulham. A corner from the right finds Michael Hector in space in the penalty area, but Robin Koch blocks his header goalwards and deflects the effort over for another corner.</p>

<p>Harrison Reed then fires harmlessly over from the edge of the area. Scott Parker's side beginning to up the ante here.</p>

<p>9 mins: Fulham haven't really got going so far, while Marcelo Bielsa's side have settled. </p>

<p>Patrick Bamford goes down just inside the Fulham half but referee Anthony Taylor is not having any of it. </p>

<p>5 mins: What a start for Leeds. Kalvin Phillips puts in Leeds' first corner of the game, it's cleared to the back post but Helder Costa is there unmarked to slam home from eight yards out.</p>

<p>A thumping finish which thundered in off the bar but it was poor marking from Fulham. Another sloppy goal from a set piece for Scott Parker's men.</p>

<p>3 mins: Fulham defender Joe Bryan, who scored am ambitious free-kick in the play-off final win over Brentford last month, has an early free-kick chance from 25 yards out but he fires wide.</p>

<p>0 mins: We're underway in Leeds. Aleksandar Mitrovic kicks the first Premier League ball at Elland Road in 16 years.</p>

<p>A late change to the line-up for Leeds. Pablo Hernandez has been injured in the warm-up so record signing Rodrigo gets his first Premier League start for the Whites.</p>

<p>Leeds XI: Meslier, Ayling, Koch, Cooper, Dallas, Phillips, Klich, Costa, Rodrigo, Harrison, Bamford.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Right the teams are in the tunnel and kick-off is just moments away, here's a reminder of the line-ups at Elland Road:</p>

<p>Leeds XI: Meslier, Ayling, Koch, Cooper, Dallas, Phillips, Klich, Costa, Hernandez, Harrison, Bamford.</p>

<p>Fulham XI: Areola, Tete, Hector, Odoi, Bryan, Cavaleiro, Reed, Anguissa, Onomah, Kamara, Mitrovic.</p>

<p>It's been a good afternoon for Carlo Ancelotti this afternoon as his Everton side have made it two wins from two with a 5-2 thumping of West Brom.</p>

<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored a hat-trick while James Rodriguez also added a goal in a game which saw Kieran Gibbs and Baggies manager Slaven Bilic sent off.</p>

<p>Here's Sportsmail reporter Joe Bernstein's report from Goodison Park...</p>

<p>Warm-ups coming to an end with kick-off ten minutes until kick-off.</p>

<p>It's a sunny day at Elland Road this afternoon, will it be a fiery encounter this afternoon?</p>

<p>It' barely been a few months since these two sides last met when they were both Championship sides. </p>

<p>In one of the first matches played behind closed doors, Leeds ran out 3-0 winners at Elland Road in June, with Patrick Bamford, Ezgjan Alioski and Jack Harrison scoring the goals.</p>

<p>Scott Parker will be hoping to change the record this time around...</p>

<p>The Premier League party is about to begin in the city of Leeds for the first time in a decade-and-a-half.</p>

<p>How excited are you Leeds fans?</p>

<p>Scott Parker will be boosted by the return to fitness of Aleksandar Mitrovic, who missed the back end of last season and was on the bench for last week's defeat to Arsenal. </p>

<p>The Serbian captains the Cottagers at Elland Road this afternoon, while there are also first Premier League starts for goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and right-back Kenny Tete.</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa makes one change from the side that were cruelly beaten 4-3 by Premier League champions Liverpool last weekend. Club captain Liam Cooper returns to the heart of the defence in place of Pascal Struijk. </p>

<p>Robin Koch keeps his spot despite giving away a penalty in the first-half and partners Cooper this afternoon, while Illan Meslier returns between the sticks after Kiko Casilla wore the armband for the midweek defeat to Hull City in the Carabao Cup.</p>

<p>📋 One change to the side which faced Liverpool last week, as #LUFC captain Liam Cooper returns</p>

<p>Good afternoon everyone and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Leeds United and Fulham.</p>

<p>It's a big day for the city of Leeds as Elland Road welcomes back top-flight football for the first time in 16 years. </p>

<p>Fellow Premier League newboys Fulham are the visitors with kick-off at 3pm. That means team news is out so let's look at how the teams line-up...</p>
