        <p>She is the daughter of Sadie Frost and Jude Law.</p>

<p>And Iris Law proved that she was a star in her own right as she flaunted her model credentials at the Bulgari Spring Summer 2021 event in Milan, Italy. </p>

<p>The 19-year-old displayed her enviable physique in a cutout grey co-od ensemble as she stepped out with her model beau Jyrrel Roberts, 21, on Friday. </p>

<p>Stunning: Iris Law, 19, proved that she was a star in her own right as she flaunted her model credentials at the Bulgari Spring Summer 2021 event in Milan, Italy</p>

<p>Iris looked effortlessly chic in the tight-fitting outfit which comprised of high-waisted trousers and a plunging square-neck top. </p>

<p>She scraped her brunette locks into a neat topknot and added a flick of black eyeliner while adding height to her look with a glimpse of a bright yellow heel. </p>

<p>The star finished her look with a silver clutch bag and floral detailed necklace to draw attention to her décolletage. </p>

<p>Couple: Jyrrel Roberts, 21 opted for a navy check shirt which he layered over a mustard t-shirt as he posed with his arm around Iris</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jyrrel opted for a navy check shirt which he layered over a mustard t-shirt as he posed with his arm around Iris. </p>

<p>Also attending the event was model Nieves Álvarez, 46, who showcased her toned sun-kissed limbs in a strapless pink sequin top with black vinyl trousers. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Princess Marie-Louise of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, known as Lilly Wittegenstein, wowed in a white jumpsuit. </p>

<p>It comes after Iris showed off her svelte physique as she shared a new smouldering holiday snap from her idyllic getaway in August.</p>

<p>The model looked incredible as she wore a tiny pink zebra print bikini with a triangle top with straps that wrapped around her toned waist. </p>

<p>Beauty: The Bulgari ambassador finished her look with an an emerald green kimono draped over her shoulders</p>

<p>Iris finished her swimwear look, which also included tie-waist bottoms, with a pair of stylish orange hued sunglasses. </p>

<p>The model left her brunette locks loose into a relaxed tousled hairdo and added a slick of sun-kissed make-up.</p>

<p>Iris knew how to work her best angles as she seductively posed on a rock at the beach during her getaway. She captioned the snap: 'Xoxoxoxoxxoxo gossip girl.'</p>

<p>Glam: Model Nieves Álvarez, 46, who showcased her toned sun-kissed limbs in a strapless pink sequin top with black vinyl trousers</p>

<p>Working it: Nieves put on a leggy display in the towering heels and tight-fitting trousers </p>

<p>Keeping it real, she also posted a fun snap of herself getting her temperature tested while wearing a mask amid the Covid-19 crisis.    </p>

<p>Last year, Iris discussed growing up with famous parents and how she is managing with her newly found fame in an interview with ES Magazine.</p>

<p>She said her parents, who divorced following six years of marriage in 2003, had given her normality in her childhood despite their A-list status.</p>

<p>Work it: It comes after Iris showed off her svelte physique as she shared a new smouldering holiday snap from her idyllic getaway in August </p>

<p>She said: 'My dad was really young. He'd had all his kids [with Frost] by 30. Mum, too. She also had a baby face.   </p>

<p>'I can never tell [her age] in pictures, I'll say, "What, you had three kids by that age?" She looks 17.'</p>

<p>Recalling her own memories of that time eating snacks on Primose Hill, she said: 'My parents weren't rock 'n' roll when I was growing up, they were just my parents. </p>

<p>'Everyone's parents were rock 'n' roll when they were young. That's not a crazy thing.' </p>

<p>Sadie Frost  2 September 1997 - 29 October 2003</p>

<p>Three children - son Rafferty, 23, daughter Iris, 19, and son Rudy, 17</p>

<p>The couple met on the set of film Shopping. In what was his first major role, Jude was just 19. Sadie was a 25-year-old married mother-of-one.</p>

<p>Sadie Frost (pictured in 1996)</p>

<p>She divorced her husband, Spandau Ballet's Gary Kemp, in 1995.</p>

<p>Jude and Sadie subsequently married and have three children. In her 2010 autobiography, Crazy Days, Sadie said: 'The force of the love I felt for Jude and his intense ambition made me feel out of control'. </p>

<p>Sadie late revealed her struggle with post-natal depression was a contributing factor to her divorce from the actor. </p>

<p>She wrote in her book: 'The more I worried about my condition, the more self-obsessed I became and the less attention I gave to Jude'.</p>

<p>Sienna Miller 2004 - February 2006</p>

<p>Jude was 30 when he broke up with Sadie. Following their 2003 divorce, he met Sienna Miller while filming Alfie, in which he played the titular role. </p>

<p>Sienna Miller (pictured in 2004)</p>

<p>Their high-profile romance came crashing down when it was revealed he had an affair with their kids' nanny Daisy Wright. </p>

<p>In his public apology to Sienna, he said: 'Following the reports in today's papers, I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us. </p>

<p>'I want to publicly apologise to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused. There is no defence for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.' </p>

<p>Daisy Wright 2006</p>

<p>Daisy was hired by Sadie and Jude in August 2004 to be a weekend nanny for their children. </p>

<p>Daisy Wright (pictured in 2006)</p>

<p>She later revealed they had embarked on an affair while he was still in a relationship with Sienna and sold her story with many tawdry details - including one of his kids walking in on them in bed. </p>

<p>Daisy later admitted she regretted selling a kiss and tell on the star. The story was engineered by disgraced late publicist Max Clifford - who was famed for orchestrating kiss and tells to make the subject famous.  </p>

<p>After the affair was revealed, Sienna is said to have told an interviewer: 'Daisy better live in fear. </p>

<p>'I'm looking forward to the day when our paths will cross, which I know they will. I just hope that woman doesn't run into me in a dark alley!' </p>

<p>Samantha Burke 2008</p>

<p>One child - daughter Sophia, 10, born September 2009</p>

<p>Jude dated model Samantha briefly while he was filming Sherlock Holmes in 2008 and they had already split when she discovered she was pregnant. </p>

<p>Samantha Burke (pictured in 2009)</p>

<p>Speaking about Sophia, Samantha said: 'She has Jude’s chin and nose, and she does a little pout, that I notice he’s done before... There are no plans for [Jude to visit] at the moment, but I know he’s busy.'</p>

<p>On their relationship, she said: 'I ran into Jude in a nightclub one night. </p>

<p>'I instantly knew who he was, but he seemed really funny; he was cracking jokes with people and he included me in that. </p>

<p>'The next thing I knew I was on the pavement outside, being twirled around – it was a lot of fun. </p>

<p>'Following that initial meeting, Jude and I went out several times. He was a lot of fun to be around, always making me laugh and smile.' </p>

<p>Catherine Harding 2014</p>

<p>One child - daughter Ada, five, born March 2015</p>

<p>Singer songwriter Catherine- who is known as Cat Cavelli - was 23 when she dated Jude, then 41, who was filming on location in the Czech Republic as he grew close to the aspiring musician. </p>

<p>Catherine Harding (pictured in 2015)</p>

<p>She recently competed on The Voice. Ada was born after a brief romance and they had already split when they announced the pregnancy.</p>

<p>After the birth, she said: 'She looks like Jude massively, she doesn’t look like me. Jude is really funny and sweet. I remember last week he came over and he had to change her on the park bench. He cleaned her all up.</p>

<p>He is a good dad and she sees her brothers and sisters. He takes her out all the time. </p>

<p>'The birth was really painful, I only wanted my mum there, it was a C-section, it was really horrible. But he came straight after and was really amazing.'</p>

<p>Phillipa Coan 2015-current day</p>

<p>Jude and who were first spotted together at the Hay literary festival in 2015. </p>

<p>Phillipa Coan (pictured in 2016)</p>

<p>Last year, they were married at Old Marylebone Town Hall in London before partying in Mayfair – three months after the actor announced their engagement.</p>

<p>The pregnancy comes months after Law revealed that he would ‘absolutely’ be open to having more children with his beloved wife. </p>

<p>The Talented Mr Ripley actor said: ‘I love it, so absolutely why not? I’m very lucky to be involved with someone I’m madly in love with...</p>

<p>'The idea of having more children would be just wonderful. I’m fortunate to be with someone where I’m having more fun than I’ve ever had in my life. </p>
