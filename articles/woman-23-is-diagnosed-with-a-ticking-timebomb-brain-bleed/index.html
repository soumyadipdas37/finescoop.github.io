        <p>A young woman discovered she'd been harbouring a deadly brain condition since birth when she collapsed while on a night out.</p>

<p>Jade Henderson, now 23, from Hartlepool, was thought to be a healthy 22-year-old when she fell to the ground within minutes of meeting her friends in Hebburn, South Tyneside.</p>

<p>She was rushed to hospital where she spent ten days fighting for her life in a coma after 'a ticking timebomb' brain bleed was found inside her head. </p>

<p>Medics discovered Jade had an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) - a tangle of blood vessels which disrupts blood flow and oxygen circulation - and that she'd had it since she was born without anyone knowing about it.</p>

<p>Three more AVMs have since been discovered in Jade - who had to learn to read, walk and talk again after first leaving hospital - which will need careful treatment and monitoring. </p>

<p>Jade Henderson (pictured left, recently, and right, last year, before her collapse), now 23, from Hartlepool, was thought to be a healthy 22-year-old when she fell to the ground within minutes of meeting her friends in Hebburn, South Tyneside</p>

<p>Jade (pictured with her mother Sharon) was rushed to hospital where she spent ten days fighting for her life in a coma after 'a ticking timebomb' brain bleed was found inside her head</p>

<p>Her mother Sharon Henderson, 50, who was told Jade probably would not survive, said: 'She died twice on the table. Her heart stopped beating. She had a stroke as well.' </p>

<p>'They asked me if I wanted to come in and say goodbye to her. I was in a daze, I was trying to be normal for everyone else but my daughter had this silent killer and there was nothing I could do.'</p>

<p>Jade added: 'All I can remember is waking up on a high dependency ward and asking for chips and gravy.</p>

<p>'I couldn't believe it when they told me what had happened to me. I thought they were joking.'</p>

<p>Jade collapsed at around 7pm on November 9 last year. She was first taken to South Tyneside Hospital and then transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary where surgeons operated until 4.30am the next day.</p>

<p>Medics discovered Jade (pictured before her injury) had an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) - a tangle of blood vessels which disrupts blood flow and oxygen circulation - and that she'd had it since she was born without anyone knowing about it</p>

<p>Three more AVMs have since been discovered in Jade (pictured in hospital after her operation) - who had to learn to read, walk and talk again after first leaving hospital - which will need careful treatment and monitoring</p>

<p>They found that Jade had an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) which disrupts blood flow and oxygen circulation - and that she'd had it since she was born, according to Sharon.</p>

<p>An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a specific term used to describe a tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between arteries and veins.</p>

<p>High pressure arteries containing fast flowing blood are directly connected to low pressure veins, which normally only contain slow flowing blood.</p>

<p>This means that blood from the arteries drains directly into the veins - without stopping to supply the normal tissues in that part of the body with essential substances like oxygen and nutrition.</p>

<p>Over time this can lead to the normal tissues becoming painful or fragile.</p>

<p>It also means that the AVM gets progressively larger over time as the amount of blood flowing through it increases, and it can cause problems due to its size.</p>

<p>Finally, it may also mean that the heart has to work harder to keep up with the extra blood flow.</p>

<p>Some doctors describe an AVM as 'a ring road that bypasses the high street of a town'.</p>

<p>Traffic (or blood) will use the bypass rather than the high street which suffers as a result.</p>

<p>AVMs are thought to affect approximately 1.4 in every 100,000 people.</p>

<p>Source: Great Ormond Street Hospital </p>

<p>AVM's only affect one per cent of the UK population and most cases are men. The AVM had burst in Jade's head. </p>

<p>The next day, she was rushed back into surgery with another bleed and had to have part of her skull bone removed, said her mother.</p>

<p>Experts have since discovered that Jade has three more AVMs which need careful treatment and monitoring to get rid of.</p>

<p>Jade needs gamma knife radiation treatment at Sheffield Hallamshire Hospital, where she's set to be treated on September 10. </p>

<p>Incredibly, because the rupture happened on the left side of her brain, it may have saved her life because a bleed on the other part could have been fatal.</p>

<p>Jade explained: 'The cognitive side of the brain is the opposite side to what you write with.'</p>

<p>Cabin crew member Jade, who now has aphasia (a condition affecting her speech), dyslexia and a loss of part of her eyesight, remained in hospital from November 9 to December 18 and had to learn how to read, write, walk and talk all over again.</p>

<p>She was allowed home over Christmas and New Year and then went into rehabilitation where she stayed until a week before the pandemic restrictions started in March.  </p>

<p>Now, Jade, who is determined to live each day as it comes, and her mother have spoken out to raise awareness of AVMs during AVM Awareness Month.</p>

<p>Jade said: 'You don't know AVMs are there until you either have a bleed or you get really bad headaches and go for a CT or MRI scan, or an angiogram. I want to help others. I am so grateful to everyone who helped me - family, friends, everyone.' </p>

<p>Mother Sharon told of the day her daughter's life was changed so dramatically, recalling: 'No-one is aware of these things. It is a silent and deadly killer.</p>

<p>'Jade was a normal healthy 22-year-old doing all the normal things that 22-year-olds do. She loved dancing. On this day, she had gone to meet her friends and phoned me at ten to 7 to say she had got there safely.</p>

<p>'At one minute past 7, I got a call to say she had collapsed. She had complained of a headache and her ear popping and then she collapsed.</p>

<p>Her mother Sharon Henderson, 50, who was told Jade (pictured recently) probably would not survive, said: 'She died twice on the table. Her heart stopped beating. She had a stroke as well.'</p>

<p>'When I got to hospital, they took me to the family room and told me it was really serious. They told me I might be walking out of here without her. I was walking around dazed like I was not there.'</p>

<p>It was down to the quick intervention of her friends at the scene and the expert help Jade received in hospital that she survived. </p>

<p>Sharon added: 'They told me that if it had been 10 minutes longer, she would have been dead. Everyone who came to her aid deserves to be praised.'</p>

<p>Sharon also praised the hospital staff at South Tyneside and the RVI and said: 'I can't thank them enough. It is down to them that she is still here.'</p>
