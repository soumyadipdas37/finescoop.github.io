        <p>A lawyer for former FBI Special Agent Peter Stzork alleged Monday that some of his client’s notes made public in a case involving former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn have been doctored.</p>

<p>Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, made the shocking accusation in a letter to US District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan on Monday.</p>

<p>He insisted that at least two notes disclosed by Flynn’s defense team as part of the fired Trump aide's criminal prosecution for allegedly lying to Robert Mueller’s special counsel inquiry in 2017 appear to have been 'altered'. </p>

<p>According to Goelman, the notes include ‘handwritten additions’ – inserted dates – that were not written by the shamed former FBI agent.</p>

<p>‘On at least two occasions, there were handwritten additions, not written by Mr. Strzok, inserting dates, apparently designed to indicate the date or dates on which the notes were written,’ Goelman began. ‘On at least one occasion, the date added is wrong and could be read to suggest that a meeting at the White House happened before it actually did.’</p>

<p>A lawyer for former FBI Special Agent Peter Stzork (left) alleged Monday that some of his client’s notes made public in a case involving former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn (right) may have been doctored.</p>

<p>Accompanied with the letter, Goelman also shared the two pages of notes in question, complete with highlighting, to telegraph the contentious notations.</p>

<p>Accompanied with the letter, Goelman also shared the two pages of notes in question, complete with highlighting, to telegraph the contentious notations.</p>

<p>‘I also note that the texts of Mr. Strzok’s that were attached to the defendant’s pleadings include portions that had not previously been released and have nothing to do with [the] Flynn case or, more broadly, with the Department of Justice,’ the letter continued.</p>

<p>Strzok’s attorney also argued documents brought forth by Flynn’s team violate a court order.</p>

<p>Flynn’s attorneys Sidney Powell and Jesse Binnall filed the documents in question on September 24, claiming that they were evidence of ‘outrageous, deliberate misconduct by FBI and and DOJ—playing games with the life of a national hero’.</p>

<p>Strzok, who was fired from the FBI in 2018, was one of the investigators who questioned Flynn about his discussions with Russian officials in 2017 and believed he lied about them.</p>

<p>The agent drew notoriety for anti-Trump text messages he sent during an extramarital affair with FBI attorney Lisa Page while employed by the bureau.</p>

<p>Strzok was removed from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team once those messages were discovered.</p>

<p>A report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said Strzok's messages were inappropriate and ‘cast a cloud over the FBI’s handling’ of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server.</p>

<p>According to Goelman, the notes include ‘handwritten additions’ – inserted dates – that were not written by the shamed former FBI agent, appearing as if the documents had been ‘altered’</p>

<p>The Flynn prosecution was a signature criminal case in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into ties between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia.</p>

<p>Flynn was the only person charged in the Mueller investigation who had served in the White House and he agreed months into the investigation to cooperate with the authorities in hopes of receiving a lighter sentence.</p>

<p>He was questioned by the FBI at the White House, just days after Trump's inauguration, about his conversations with the then-Russian ambassador to the U.S. pertaining to sanctions that had just been imposed by the Obama administration for election interference.</p>

<p>The conversation alarmed law enforcement and intelligence officials who were already investigating whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russia to sway the presidential election in Trump's favor.</p>

<p>They were puzzled by the White House's public insistence that Flynn and the diplomat had not discussed sanctions.</p>

<p>But the Justice Department argued in May that the FBI had insufficient basis to interrogate Flynn about that conversation, which Attorney General William Barr has described as fully appropriate for an incoming national security adviser to have had.</p>

<p>But in August a federal appeals court in Washington declined to dismiss the prosecution of Flynn, permitting a judge to scrutinize the Justice Department's request to dismiss its case against Trump's former national security adviser.</p>

<p>The decision has kept the case - at least temporarily - alive and rebuffed efforts by both Flynn's lawyers and the Justice Department to force the prosecution to be dropped without further inquiry from the judge, who has for months declined to dismiss it.</p>

<p>The ruling came as one of a number of unusual twists and turns over the last year and prompted a separation of powers tussle involving a veteran federal judge and the Trump administration.</p>

<p>The Flynn prosecution was a signature criminal case in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into ties between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia</p>

<p>The Flynn conflict arose in May when the Justice Department moved to dismiss the prosecution despite Flynn's own guilty plea to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition period.</p>

<p>But US District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who had upbraided Flynn for his behavior at a 2018 court appearance, signaled his skepticism at the government's unusual motion.</p>

<p>He refused to dismiss the case and instead scheduled a hearing and appointed a retired federal judge to argue against the Justice Department's position.</p>

<p>That former judge, John Gleeson, challenged the motives behind the department's dismissal request and called it a 'gross abuse' of prosecutorial power.</p>

<p>Flynn's lawyers sought to bypass Sullivan and obtain an appeals court order that would have required the case's immediate dismissal.</p>

<p>They argued that Sullivan had overstepped his bounds by scrutinizing a dismissal request that both sides, the defense and the Justice Department, were in agreement about and that the case was effectively moot once prosecutors decided to abandon it.</p>

<p>At issue before the court was whether Sullivan could be forced to grant the Justice Department's dismissal request without even holding a hearing into the basis for the motion.</p>

<p>'We have no trouble answering that question in the negative,' the court wrote in an unsigned opinion for the eight judges in the majority.</p>

<p>The judges also rejected defense efforts to have the case reassigned to a different judge.</p>

<p>Mike Pence was a career Army intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan and Iraq and was still in uniform as a three-star general when he became Barack Obama's head of Defense Intelligence in July 2012.</p>

<p>But he fell out badly with the Obama administration, was forced out in July 2014 and moved into private intelligence consulting.  </p>

<p>2015</p>

<p>December 10: Flynn is paid to travel to Moscow and sits beside Vladimir Putin at dinner celebrating propaganda outlet RT (right). His consulting business has Russian clients</p>

<p>2016</p>

<p>February: Flynn signs up to provide national security advice to the Trump campaign; in the next few months he is floated as a possible running mate</p>

<p>July 20 : Flynn leads 'lock her up' chants at the Republican National Convention and claims Obama concealed the actions of Osama bin Laden</p>

<p>July 31: FBI open counter-intelligence investigation Crossfire Hurricane into group of Trump aides, including Flynn, for possible Russian influence. In 2014 an FBI informer had told agents he saw Flynn spending time at a dinner in the UK with a Russian woman with ties to Kremlin intelligence; the information is included in their investigation.  Flynn is code-named Crossfire Razor</p>

<p>November 4: Trump wins the election, and meets Obama who advises him not to hire Flynn. Trump ignores the advice and makes him national security adviser designate</p>

<p>November 30: Obama's ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, makes the first of what will be 48 requests by Obama and Obama-eras officials to 'unmask' a redaction from intelligence reports which covers up Flynn's name </p>

<p>December 2016</p>

<p>Flynn meets Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak (right)  at Trump Tower and exchanges calls and messages throughout the month. </p>

<p>December 29: Hours after Obama announces sanctions on Russia for election interference, they speak and Flynn says it will be 'reviewed' when Trump takes power. The call is heard by intelligence agents who monitor Kisylak's calls and details are included in intelligence reports. The next day Putin says Russia won't retaliate for the sanctions</p>

<p>2017</p>

<p>January 4: FBI drafts report saying there is 'no derogatory information on RAZOR [Flynn].' But 20 minutes later FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok tells case agent 'don't close RAZOR,' and '7th floor involved' meaning FBI leadership. He also emails lover Lisa Page, a senior FBI lawyer, about the Logan Act - a never-enforced 1799 law banning private people from interfering in foreign relations. 'Razor still open,' he writes and calls news 'serendipitously good'. 'Phew, but yeah, that's amazing that he is still open. Good I guess,' Page replies. Strzok respond: 'Yeah, our utter incompetence actually helps us. 20% of the time I'm guessing :)'</p>

<p>January 5: Obama holds Oval Office briefing on Russian election interference with Joe Biden, CIA director John Brennan, FBI director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and deputy attorney general Sally Yates. He asks Comey and Yates to stay behind and says he has 'learned of the information' about Flynn's call to Kislyak. Comey mentions the Logan Act</p>

<p>January 6: Obama's top intel figures - Brennan, Clapper and Comey - give the Trump team including Trump a briefing on Russia at Trump Tower </p>

<p>January 10: Joe Biden is most senior Obama official to request an 'unmasking' of an intelligence report which reveals Flynn's name</p>

<p>January 12: Bombshell Washington Post report reveals Flynn's call to Kislyak on December 29, 'according to a senior U.S. government official' saying: 'What did Flynn say, and did it undercut the U.S. sanctions?' It mentions the Logan Act</p>

<p>January 14: Flynn tells Pence he did not discuss sanctions; in coming days Trump officials repeat this on television - including Mike Pence the following day</p>

<p>January 20: Trump is inaugurated; Flynn becomes national security advisor</p>

<p>January 22: The Wall Street Journal reveals Flynn is subject to a counter-intelligence investigation over links to Russia</p>

<p>January 23: Strzok and Andrew McCabe the FBI Deputy director exchange messages planning to interview Flynn</p>

<p>January 24: Two FBI agents - Peter Strzok and one whose name remains secret - go to the White House and interview Flynn in his West Wing office. Their notes say he denies talking about sanctions with Kislyak and said 'if I did I don't remember'</p>

<p>January 26 and 27: Yates tells White House counsel Don McGahn that Flynn has lied to Mike Pence and other officials, is therefore compromised, could be blackmailed by Russia, and other aspects of his conduct are worrying which she can't tell McGahn because they are classified</p>

<p>January 28: Flynn sits in the Oval Office to take part in Trump's first call with Putin </p>

<p>February 9: Washington Post reveals Flynn did discuss sanctions and publishes interview in which he repeats denial 'categorically.' After the story is published, he tells the newspaper a different version  - that he may have discussed sanctions</p>

<p>February 10 and 11: Trump says he will 'look into' Flynn but the aide is at Mar-a-Lago dinner with Shinzo Abe. Pence </p>

<p>February 13: Washington Post reveals that McGahn was warned about Flynn by Yates. Flynn resigns admitting he 'inadvertently' misled Pence, prompting Pence to mislead on Face the Nation in January</p>

<p>February 14: Trump meets Comey and says Flynn is 'a good guy' and 'I hope you can see your way to letting this go.' </p>

<p>March 30: Flynn offers to testify to Congress - at the time both House and Senate are Republican-controlled - or the FBI on Trump-Russia in exchange for immunity from prosecution; nobody takes up the deal offer</p>

<p>May 9: Trump fires Comey, and on May 17 Robert Mueller is appointed special counsel</p>

<p>May 10: Senate Intel Committee subpoena Flynn for his contacts with Russia; he cites Fifth Amendment; they later subpoena in more detail, and by early June he turns over documents voluntarily</p>

<p>November 5: Mueller's investigators revealed to be ready to indict Flynn and his son Michael Jr. on multiple charges. They are looking at his foreign lobbying and even whether he plotted to kidnap a Turkish cleric from the U.S. and deliver him to Turkey - but are also wiling to strike a deal to let his son off if he flips</p>

<p>November 16: Mueller team interview Flynn for first time </p>

<p>November 22: Flynn withdraws from 'joint defense deal' with Trump, suggesting a deal is in the works </p>

<p>December 1: Flynn signs a plea deal with Mueller; he will plead guilty to lying to the FBI at the White House interview. In exchange his son gets out of charges, and Flynn himself escapes charges of failing to register his lobbying for foreign entities. He appears in court and admits under oath lying to the FBI and affirms that he understands the deal. 'I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right,' he says. The White House says: 'The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year.'</p>

<p>December 2: Trump tweets: 'I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI'</p>

<p>2018</p>

<p>January: Flynn is repeatedly interviewed as he cooperates with Mueller and sentencing is repeatedly deferred</p>

<p>June 7: Obama deputy national security advisor reveals in book that Obama administration first learned of Flynn's December 2016 communications with Kislyak from Trump transition team members and not from 'unmasking' his name in intelligence reports</p>

<p>December 18: Flynn appears in court for sentencing hearing; Mueller's recommendation is little or no jail time. But Judge Emmet Sullivan says 'arguably you sold your country out' and asks why he was not charged with 'treason.' Sentencing is deferred</p>

<p>2019</p>

<p>June 12: Flynn fires Covington &amp; Burling, his white shoe law firm, and hires new lawyer Sidney Powell, who had told him on Fox News to ditch his plea deal</p>

<p>August 30: Flynn files motion accusing prosecutors of conning him into a guilty plea by withholding exculpatory material while other parts of the government trying to 'smear' him as a Russian agent</p>

<p>December 16: Judge rejects Flynn's motion after reviewing Intel Inspector General report into the FBI and DOJ actions before the 2016 election and sets sentencing date for January 28</p>

<p>2020</p>

<p>January 7: Prosecutors say they want up to six months for Flynn; a week later he files to ask to withdraw his guilty plea 'because of the government's bad faith, vindictiveness, and breach of the plea agreement.' A week later he asks for probation if he can't get out of his deal. Sentencing is deferred until February 20</p>

<p>February 14</p>

<p>Attorney General Bill Barr appoints political appointee Jeffrey Jensen, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, to examine Flynn's prosecution</p>

<p>April 29</p>

<p>New notes released by Jensen show Strzok discussing keeping Flynn as a target on January 4 2017. They also show an unnamed FBI official's notes from around the interview with Flynn on January 24 2017, saying: 'What is our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?' Trump starts a tweet storm which lasts into the next day, saying: 'What happened to General Michael Flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!'</p>

<p>May 7</p>

<p>Department of Justice says it is withdrawing support for prosecuting Flynn saying the interview in the West Wing was 'untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn' and that it was 'conducted without any legitimate investigative basis.' But career prosecutors who have led the case quit just before the move is announced</p>

<p>May 12</p>

<p>Judge Emmet Sullivan puts a hold on prosecutors dropping the case and the next day appoints a 'friend of the court,' former Mafia prosecutor and retired federal judge John Gleeson to argue against the DOJ's motion to dismiss, causing uproar among Flynn's supporters</p>

<p>May 13</p>

<p>A series of senior Obama officials are named as having asked for 'unmaskings' of intelligence reports which resulted in Flynn's name being uncovered, in newly-declassified documents. But it later emerges intelligence report of his call to Kislyak used his full name so people with access to it could understand who the Russian was speaking to, which also means leaking his name is not a crime</p>

<p>May 21 </p>

<p>Three-judge appeals panel orders Judge Sullivan to explain legal basis for not accepting prosecution request to drop Flynn's conviction </p>

<p>May 22</p>

<p>FBI director Christopher Wray launches 'after-action review' of bureau's investigation</p>

<p>June 24</p>

<p>Federal appeals judges rule 2-1 that Sullivan has to dismiss the case. Trump takes a victory lap, tweeting 'Great!'</p>

<p>July 4</p>

<p>Flynn tweets a video of himself taking 'the oath,' a bizarre ceremony linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which ends the Oath of Allegiance by saying 'where we go one, we go all,' a QAnon slogan</p>

<p>July 9</p>

<p>Judge Sullivan asks the entire D.C. appeals circuit to hear the case 'en banc' and overturn the order to dismiss. An unnamed member of the appeals circuit made the same request and the judges voted to hear it 'en banc' August 31, legally ignoring Sullivan's request</p>

<p>Entire D.C. appeals circuit rules against Flynn, sending the case back to Sullivan and allowing him to hold an inquiry into DOJ handling of the prosecution</p>
