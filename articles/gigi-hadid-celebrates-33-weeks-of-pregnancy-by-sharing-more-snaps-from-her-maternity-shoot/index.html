        <p>Gigi Hadid gave her fans a good look at her bare pregnant stomach with new black-and-white portraits shared on Instagram on Monday.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old Tommy Hilfiger model had on a white bra top with unbutton denim jeans as she placed a hand on her midsection.</p>

<p>'33 weeks,' was all the blonde - whose full name is Jelena Noura Hadid - said in her caption. If she meant she is 33 weeks along now, that means she is 7 1/2 months along and is due in late October as an average pregnancy lasts 40 weeks. If she meant she was 33 weeks when the photos were taken in July that means she is 38 weeks along and due in mid September.</p>

<p>33 weeks ♡</p>

<p>A post shared by  Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Aug 31, 2020 at 7:52am PDT</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The runway star wore a dainty gold bracelet as she placed her other hand in her back pocket.</p>

<p>Gigi was beautifully made up with heavy eye makeup and a painted pout. Necklaces were layered and she had on mid size gold earrings.</p>

<p>Fellow models Christy Turlington and Ashley Graham 'liked' the post Hadid shared with her 57M followers.</p>

<p>There was also a behind-the-scenes video shared by the star where she was posing with one knee up and twisting her body sideways so the photographer could see the shape of her big bump.</p>

<p>There was a white backdrop behind her and black blocks of fabric on the sides with several crew members trying to land the perfect image.</p>

<p>New snaps: Gigi Hadid gave her fans a good look at her bare pregnant stomach with new black-and-white portraits shared on Instagram on Monday</p>

<p>Even closer: The 25-year-old Tommy Hilfiger model had on a white bra top with unbutton denim jeans as she placed a hand on her midsection</p>

<p>Gigi does her thing: '33 weeks,' was all the blonde - whose full name is Jelena Noura Hadid - said in her caption. If she meant she is 33 weeks now, that means she is 7 1/2 months along and is due in late October as an average pregnancy lasts 40 weeks</p>

<p>Gigi also posted video from a setup involving a green dress that showed off her bump too quite well.</p>

<p>Last week the Los Angeles native took to Instagram to share stunning pregnancy portraits in three new black-and-white images taken by photographers Luigi and Iango in late July.</p>

<p>'Cherishing this time. appreciate all the love &amp; well wishes ♡ will never forget creating these special images,' said the Vogue model as she thanked her 'friends,' photographers Liugi and Iango, stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson and makeup artist Erin Parsons, all of whom worked on her shoot.</p>

<p>Sea green: Gigi also posted video from a setup involving a green dress that showed off her bump too quite well</p>

<p>'Thank you. I love you!' added the blonde beauty. 'Growin an angel :),' the former Guess model wrote in another caption as she revealed the shoot took place on July 26. There were also several 'behind the scenes' images shared.</p>

<p>And on her Instagram Stories, the cover girl added, 'Can't wait to meet you.' </p>

<p>She also admitted last week that partaking in the sentimental project was 'more tiring than working normally,' after a fan asked what it was like 'shooting 'with [her] baby bump for the first time?' </p>

<p>'I loved it, I knew what I wanted from the pics and Gab and L&amp;I really made it happen for me, but was definitely more tiring than working normally,' tweeted Hadid on Thursday.</p>

<p>Another look: 'Cherishing this time. appreciate all the love &amp; well wishes ♡ will never forget creating these special images,' said the Vogue model as she thanked her 'friends,' photographers Liugi and Iango, stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson and makeup artist Erin Parsons</p>

<p>The New York City based star is expecting her first child with 27-year-old singer Zayn Malik this fall. </p>

<p>The sister of Bella and Anwar Hadid was nicely made up with her long blonde hair worn down as she modeled sheer white clothing in a photo studio setting.</p>

<p>Gigi is back in New York City with Zayn after spending the pandemic enjoying the great outdoors on her farm in Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>The former One Direction star and the model have been together on and off for the last five years. </p>

<p>7.26.20 🕊</p>

<p>A post shared by  Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Aug 26, 2020 at 6:07am PDT</p>

<p>An insider told Us Weekly magazine last month: '[They are] closer than ever. Gigi has been living at her mom’s farm with Zayn. She came back to NYC recently but she plans to spend most of her pregnancy there at the farm.'</p>

<p>Gigi confirmed her pregnancy in April, after 'family sources' first revealed the news.</p>

<p>She said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. </p>

<p>'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.' </p>

<p>cherishing this time. appreciate all the love &amp; well wishes ♡ will never forget creating these special images with my friends @luigiandiango @gabriellak_j @erinparsonsmakeup thank you. I love you!</p>

<p>A post shared by  Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Aug 26, 2020 at 6:09am PDT</p>

<p>However, Gigi has remained tight-lipped about the pregnancy since first acknowledging the news, saying she thinks it's 'not the most important thing going on in the world.'</p>

<p>Hadid added: 'That's a reason that I felt that it's not really something that I need to share apart from with my family and friends. </p>

<p>'Obviously a lot of people have lost lives due to [the] coronavirus that was in the beginning of quarantine and still happening,' she said.</p>

<p>'And then we moved obviously into the reemergence of the BLM [Black Lives Matter] movement, and I thought that our presence on social media should be used for that.' </p>
