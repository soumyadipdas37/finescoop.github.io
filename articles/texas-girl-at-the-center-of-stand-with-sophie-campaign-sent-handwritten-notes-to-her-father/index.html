    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>The Texas girl who is seen on a viral video accusing her mother's fiancé of sexually abusing her wrote a series of heartbreaking notes to her father – including one that contained code words for her to use on the phone when she felt endangered.</p>

<p>Sophie, nine, is at the center of a bitter custody battle between her father Michael, 41, of Seguin, Texas, and her mother Kelly, 34, of Frisco, Texas, that has dragged on for more than five years since their divorce in July 2015.</p>

<p>Although custody was initially evenly split between both parents, their relationship has become increasingly acrimonious and a judge awarded custody to mom Kelly who eventually took the children to live more than 200 miles away from their father. </p>

<p>A video of Sophie screaming and telling her grandmother she had been sexually abused by her mother's fiancé at a handover on August 14 inspired a social media campaign called Stand With Sophie after it was posted online.  But a judge on Thursday disregarded the increasing social media pressure and has allowed Sophie and her two brothers to return with their mother and have weekend visits with dad.</p>

<p>Now DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal that the little girl sent notes to her father during lockdown in May in which she suggested a series of code words to use on the phone – including 'daisies' or 'dandelions' for danger.</p>

<p>Sophie, nine, from Texas is pictured with her father Michael, who is trying to regain custody after a video went viral showing Sophie say that her mother's fiance sexually abuses her</p>

<p> In the 20-minute long video Sophie is heard screaming as she begs to stay with her father during a custody exchange and claims her mother watches the abuse</p>

<p>DailyMail.com obtained letters written by Sophie and sent to her father containing codewords for her to use on the phone when she felt endangered. In one, the words 'daisy' or 'dandelions' was used for danger</p>

<p>Another code word was 'pens' which was to be used to mean her mother and her fiancé, 39, were fighting.</p>

<p>'Roses' meant she planned to send mail to her father, while 'pens' meant she had received some from him.</p>

<p>A second letter contained a complaint that 'Mr. Jake' – the children's name for for their mother's fiancé– had taken away her iPad for a week because 'I wouldn't stop crying'.</p>

<p>Another spoke of her mother's anger over Michael recording a conversation between them and noted that 'Mr. Jake' had told the children their father was brainwashing them.</p>

<p>Sophie also wrote of her concern that dad Michael might be arrested if the police discovered he recorded conversations between them.</p>

<p>In others, Sophie spoke of how much she loved and missed her father, and thanked him for sweets he had hidden in her bag that helped her stop crying after she had been returned to her mother's home.</p>

<p>She also begged him to send her stamps and envelopes so they could continue exchanging letters.</p>

<p>The notes are part of a cache of court documents obtained by DailyMail.com that lay bare the bitter wrangling over custody that has blighted Sophie and her brothers Jack, seven, and Lucas, six, lives.</p>

<p>Another letter contained a complaint that 'Mr. Jake' - her mother's fiancé – had taken away her iPad for a week because 'I wouldn't stop crying'</p>

<p>In other letters, Sophie spoke of how much she loved and missed her father, and thanked him for sweets he had hidden in her bag that helped her stop crying after she had been returned to her mother's home</p>

<p>Sophie also wrote of her concern that Michael might be arrested if the police discovered he recorded conversations between them</p>

<p>These notes are part of a cache of court documents obtained by DailyMail.com that lay bare the bitter wrangling over custody that has blighted Sophie and her brothers Jack, seven, and Lucas, six, lives</p>

<p>The viral video of the handover was made as the children were taken back to Frisco at the end of their summer 'long stay' of a month with their father.</p>

<p>Emails included in the court documents show that they had been due to be handed back to Kelly on July 27 but that the handover was pushed back for two weeks, after he became concerned for Sophie.</p>

<p>The documents also include records of her visits to medical facilities on June 28, July 2 and July 16 after she complained of pain in her private parts and complained of being touched by her mother's fiancé.</p>

<p>In the case management part of the document, it says the little girl told her stepmother Kourtney that 'Mr. Jake and his friends touch her sometimes and she doesn't like it.'</p>

<p>This photo was shared in Michael's video showing Sophie on a gurney with a bandaged ankle</p>

<p>A private Facebook group called Stand With Sophie has over 120,000 members who are raising awareness about Sophie's case</p>

<p>Sophie is seen telling her grandmother, who is her biological mother's mother, of abuse during a custody exchange. She is seen screaming and crying as she refuses to go with her grandmother </p>

<p>According to the reports, Sophie was then tested for sexually transmitted diseases and treated for a bacterial infection.</p>

<p>Kourtney also told doctors that Sophie had asked her what it was like to be pregnant and had said her fiance took Polaroids of her and her brothers.</p>

<p>The social services section said Kelly had been accused of being drunk in front of her children and highlighted concerns about domestic violence in her home.</p>

<p>But the documents also noted that both parents have a history of calling Child Protective Services to make complaints about the other, and that both have called police repeatedly.</p>

<p>It also said none of the previous complaints to CPS have been substantiated, including the allegations of domestic violence.</p>

<p>Outside court Thursday, a handful of protesters waved signs and demonstrated their support for Sophie – calling for her to be returned to her father immediately</p>

<p>Sophie and her two younger brothers are in the center of a bitter custody battle in Frisco, Texas, between her parents Michael and Kelly</p>

<p>Both parents appeared at a court hearing on Thursday via Zoom during which Judge Cynthia Wheless banned both parties from disparaging the other in front of the children.</p>

<p>The children are currently in Frisco but are due to be with Michael at his home over the Labor Day weekend.</p>

<p>Judge Wheless also scheduled the custody case for a two-day trial due to start November 4.</p>

<p>The sexual abuse allegations made by Sophie are currently being investigated by the Frisco Police Department while Lacy Lakeview PD has opened a second case as a result of the viral handover on August 14.</p>
