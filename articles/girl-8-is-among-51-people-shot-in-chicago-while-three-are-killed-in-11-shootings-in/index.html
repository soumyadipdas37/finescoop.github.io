        <p>Labor Day Weekend was marred by an uptick in shootings that ended with 64 Americans becoming victims of gun violence in cities across the country. </p>

<p>At least 10 people were shot dead and just over six dozen were were caught in gun-related violence as it gripped at least three major cities this weekend.</p>

<p>'The amount of violence over the holiday weekend is beyond unacceptable,' Brandon Scott, president of the Baltimore City Council,' wrote in an email. </p>

<p>The city of Baltimore this weekend saw two residents shot dead, one person fatally stabbed and 12 others shot. </p>

<p>Further west, Chicago recorded 51 victims and eight who were shot dead, including an eight-year-old girl was killed inside a parked car on Monday.</p>

<p>In New York City, a six-year-old boy was shot during a Caribbean festival in Brooklyn just three hours before a 62-year-old man was killed while walking his dogs.</p>

<p>Reports from the Windy City on Monday revealed that 43 Chicago residents were wounded in gun violence in addition to the eight dead.</p>

<p>In the most recent incident, an 8-year-old girl was killed and two adults were severely wounded while driving on the South Side.</p>

<p>The shooting occurred shortly before 6 p.m. in the Canaryville neighborhood, Chicago Police Chief of Operations Brian McDermott said.</p>

<p>The girl was with her mother and two other adults in a Subaru SUV when they stopped at a red light at 47th Street and Union Avenue, with a Dodge Charger behind them, police said. Once the stoplight turned green, authorities noted that someone in the Charger then opened fire, striking the child, a 31-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman.</p>

<p>The Charger subsequently made a U-turn and fled the area.</p>

<p>McDermott said the child was taken to Comer Children´s Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>"I stand before you, saddened and angered, that another child has lost their life in senseless gun violence in the city of Chicago," he told reporters at the scene Monday night.</p>

<p>Chicago fire officials said the man and woman were taken to the University of Chicago Medical Center in critical condition, with each suffering a gunshot wound to the back.</p>

<p>The mother of the slain child was also wounded in the crash, McDermott said. She was taken to the University of Chicago Medical Center in good condition.</p>

<p>The Cook County medical examiner´s office hasn´t released details regarding the child's death</p>

<p>An record of a listed CBS Chicago showed seven shootings took place on Sunday</p>

<p>In another instance, a four-year-old boy and an 18-year-woman are recovering in a hospital on Monday after being shot in the Gresham neighborhood.</p>

<p>The pair was shot just after midnight on Saturday when someone driving in a Dodge Challenger opened fire.</p>

<p>The young boy was struck in the leg, while the woman was hit in the back. Both were taken to local medical centers and are expected to recovered.</p>

<p>Authorities don't believe either victim was the intended target of the shooting.</p>

<p>Also on Saturday, the Chicago Police Department said they shot dead a man who lunged at officers with a knife.</p>

<p>'My girlfriend, she heard some yelling, and then she heard some police sirens – ‘Let’s go! Let’s go! Run,' Charlie Chung told CBS Chicago.</p>

<p>'I just heard some loud noises. It was like loud and rapid,' he added. </p>

<p>The sound of gunfire came around 1.40am when officers responded to reports that an unidentified man was stabbed.  The man was transported to a local hospital, but his condition is unknown,</p>

<p>Officers at the scene began searching for a suspect that was located nearly two blocks away.  </p>

<p>Authorities said the suspect was armed with a knife and refused to drop the weapon when officers asked.</p>

<p>Officers deployed a Taser gun at the suspect, but it had little affect.</p>

<p>Then, authorities said the suspect lunged at a female officer and began stabbing her several times.</p>

<p>'He then grabbed the female sergeant and began stabbing the female sergeant with a long butcher knife,' said  Supt. David Brown.</p>

<p>Officers opened fire on the suspect and the man was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>In Baltimore, one of the residents killed by gun violence over Labor Day weekend was a young food server. </p>

<p>Brad McCarthy, the owner of Maryland Blue Crab House in Dundalk, confirmed that his employee Melissa Hefty was one of the victims. </p>

<p>She served at the restaurant for  </p>

<p>New York saw a concerning spike in shootings over Labor Day Weekend, with at least 10 people shot as the surge in gun violence continues. </p>

<p>In one instance, a 62-year-old Brooklyn resident was shot dead on Monday morning while walking his dogs near his home.</p>

<p>Just two hours before that, a six-year-old boy and his mother were among three others who were shot during a festival in the same borough.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, surveillance footage from the New York Police Department showed a shootout on August 25 inside the lobby of Marlboro Houses in the Gravesend neighborhood. </p>

<p>The New York Police Department released surveillance footage of a gun fight the took place inside an apartment building lobby on August 25</p>

<p>A group of unidentified men are seen standing inside an apartment building lobby and appear to be looking towards something outside.</p>

<p>One man, who brandishes a gun in his right hand, walks further into the lobby before raising the firearm towards the door.</p>

<p>It's unclear who opens fire first, but the group of men suddenly scrambles out of the way. A different man runs into the lobby and appears to fire a round out of the open door.</p>

<p>The NYPD said that no injuries were reported. They ask anyone with information on the shooting to call Call 1-800-577-TIPS or DM them on trough their NYPD Crime Stoppers page. </p>

<p>As of August 30, the rate of shooting victims in New York City was up 120 per cent that week compared to the same time last year.  There were 64 shooting victims this year, while last year amassed to 29.</p>

<p>NYPD CompStat showed that shooting incidents were up 85 per cent, with 50 recorded this year and 27 in 2019. </p>

<p>The numbers continued to rise on Monday as a Brooklyn man was shot dead outside his Bay Ridge neighborhood home around 6:50am. </p>

<p>New York Daily News reports that Michael Scully, the owner of five cocker spaniels, was struck several times in the head and shoulders by the shooter.</p>

<p>Authorities said Scully got into an argument with the suspect after leaving his home to walk his dogs. </p>

<p>The suspect pulled out a gun, shot Scully and fled the scene before police officers arrived. </p>

<p>Scully was rushed to  NYU Langone Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The suspect has not been brought into custody.</p>

<p>The numbers continued to rise on Monday as a Brooklyn man was shot dead outside his Bay Ridge neighborhood home around 6:50am. Michael Scully, 62, (pictured) was shot dead on Monday morning by an unidentified shooter in Brooklyn</p>

<p>'I don’t know who would do this,' said William Mendez, a longtime friend of Scully's. 'I don’t believe he had any enemies. Everybody loved Mike.'</p>

<p>'He loved Brooklyn,' Mendez, 55, added. 'You needed help, he was there for you. He was just the best.'</p>

<p>According to friends of Scully, he was warm-hearted and kind man who spent several years working for a technology company. He liked to bring his dogs with him to church.  </p>

<p>He was also an entrepreneur who bought and sold items, like perfumes and clothes, on the side. Scully kept a list of all the perfumes he had in stock, friends said.</p>

<p>Scully lived downstairs from his brother in a two-family home they shared. The brother was overcome with emotion as he hugged their sister outside their home just hours after the shooting, NYDN reports.</p>

<p>David Martinez, a longtime friend of Scully, said the man's girlfriend died about two years ago and the loss was devastating.</p>

<p>Her funeral was one of the only times the Martinez saw Scully cry. The other two occasions were during the funerals of his father and mother.</p>

<p>'He didn’t deserve this,' said Martinez. 'This is execution-style.'  </p>

<p>Around 3am on Monday, in the same borough were Scully was killed, a six-year-old boy was scooped up off the pavement by his mother after they were both shot during a pre-dawn J'Ouvert celebration.</p>

<p>The boy is seen lying on the pavement in a pool of his own blood as a woman, identified as his mother, rushes over and tries to pick him up</p>

<p>In the video, obtained by DailyMail.com, some of the 300 people who gathered for a pre-dawn procession celebrating the Caribbean J'Ouvert festival are heard screaming in terror and fleeing after the gun went off. </p>

<p>A few feet away from the boy, a man is seen collapsed on the ground after he was also apparently struck by gunfire. </p>

<p>Police sources told the New York Post that the boy, identified as Maxwell Cesc-Vinho, was shot in the left leg while his mother Patricia Bratwaith, 47, and a man named Flavian Yves, 40, were struck in the left foot. </p>

<p>The sources identified the other two victims as Bob Charlotin, 46, and Kelly Barthold, 34, and said they were both shot in the right leg.  </p>

<p>Disturbing video captured the moment a six-year-old boy was scooped up off the pavement by his mother after they were both shot alongside three other people during a pre-dawn J'Ouvert celebration in Brooklyn on Monday morning</p>

<p>All five victims were transported to Kings County Hospital Center with non-life threatening injuries. </p>

<p>NYPD officers arrested two men at the scene who were both carrying guns, but police have not confirmed whether either was the shooter.   </p>

<p>Investigators are still working to determine the motive for the shooting, but NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said it appeared to be gang-related.</p>

<p>'This is a notorious gang area that, you know, we've had problems with in the past,' Harrison told reporters on Monday morning.  </p>

<p>It's unclear whether any of the victims were targeted on purpose. Harrison said that the mother and son were just getting out of a cab when they were struck.  </p>

<p>'It was really crazy - everyone was in shock,' Joshua Kristal, who was in the procession when the shooting occurred, told the Post.  </p>

<p>'The boy, his mom was carrying him. You could see there was blood in his pants. She dropped him, I didn't know what to do, then I saw tons of blood.' </p>

<p>New York City has seen a troubling spike in crime and violence this over the course of this summer. </p>

<p>Last week police revealed new data showing there were 242 shootings recorded in August, compared with just 91 in the same month last year - a 166 per cent increase. </p>
