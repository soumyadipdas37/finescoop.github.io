        <p>He was the second baker to be booted out of the tent on this series of Great British Bake Off.</p>

<p>And Makbul Patel has taken his exit with a pinch of salt, admitting he found the Twitter criticism of his bakes 'hilarious.'  </p>

<p>The 51-year-old accountant from Manchester failed to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith in biscuit week, witth his Showstopper Indian Chai tea service described as 'flat and clumsy' by Hollywood.</p>

<p>Out! He was the second baker to be booted out of the tent on this series of Great British Bake Off. And Makbul Patel has taken his exit with a pinch of salt</p>

<p>Speaking to The Mirror, Mak admitted he didn't take the criticism to heart, especially comments from Tweeters, saying: 'The comments on social media after the first episode were hilarious, including the ones that took the mickey out of my bakes.</p>

<p>'I am not easily offended, you have to take it on the chin, especially as you don't know the people. All the messages from work mates, friends and family have all been so supportive.'</p>

<p>Admitting on the show that he 'felt it in my bones' when he was sent home, Mak gushed that he loved his short stint in the tent, and in particular meeting new host Matt Lucas.  </p>

<p>'Matt was absolutely amazing, and when it got really stressful in the tent because of the time restrictions he was such a support. Noel [Fielding] is so zany and they really bounced off each other,' he said of the hosting duos.</p>

<p>Time in the tent: The 51-year-old accountant from Manchester failed to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith in biscuit week</p>

<p>Mak also singled out Prue for her praise and support, admitting: 'I didn't like the judging process, but I knew the nature of the beast and Paul and Prue were both sensational, Prue was so nice to me and I think she understood me and tried to bring out the best in me at all times – she is a picture of kindness.'</p>

<p>'I am a realist and I hope I can put things into perspective. Bake Off is a show about cakes, so I didn't get really emotional about my leaving. </p>

<p>Viewers were up in arms when Matt Lucas announced Mak was leaving the show on Tuesday night.  </p>

<p>Support: Admitting on the show that he 'felt it in my bones' when he was sent home, Mak gushed that he loved his short stint in the tent, and in particular meeting new host Matt Lucas</p>

<p>Despite Rowan having a disastrous three rounds, with Prue Leith once again mentioning the music teacher didn't take Paul Hollywood's advice to 'rein it in', Mak was eliminated.</p>

<p>Week two of Bake Off was biscuit themed, where contestants had to create chocolate Florentines, macaroons and a 3D memorable meal show-stopper. </p>

<p>Fans of the show couldn't believe eccentric music teacher Rowan had escaped leaving the tent by the skin of his teeth.  </p>

<p>The baker seemed the clear front runner to face the axe after being unable to finish off his waistcoat Florentines, leaving around half a dozen just covered in chocolate, as well as placing last in the technical with his 'peculiar piped' macarons. </p>

<p>Kind: Mak also singled out Prue for her praise and support, admitting: 'I think she understood me and tried to bring out the best in me at all times – she is a picture of kindness'</p>

<p>Then when he presented his Worse Things Happen At Sea, Paul said: 'It does look like a lighthouse but it tastes like rubber.'</p>

<p>Prue told him she expects better of him and it was 'a bit disappointing'. </p>

<p>And so viewers couldn't believe it when Mak was announced as the evicted baker after failing to impress the judges with his 'clumsy' biscuit teapot.  </p>

<p>One wrote: 'I cannot believe that Rowan was saved after his performance this week. Mak has been robbed!!!'.</p>

<p>Narrow escape: Despite Rowan have a disastrous three rounds with Prue Leith once again mentioning the teacher doesn't take Paul Hollywood's advice to 'reign it in', Mak was evicted</p>

<p>Too ambitious: Rowan seemed the clear front runner to face the axe after being unable to finish off his waistcoat florentines, leaving around half a dozen just covered in chocolate</p>

<p>Another added: 'GBBO has got me raging!!! How many times can Rowan under deliver???? Poor Mak!!!', while a third chimed: 'Poor Mak :( although I love Rowan, I honestly thought he’d be heading home. He’s been told a few times to not promise so much and that hindered him again. Gutted for Mak x'.</p>

<p>A fourth fan of the show added: 'Mak was ROBBED', while another said: 'How did Rowan manage that then,yeah he loving life but mak didn’t deserve to go'.</p>

<p>'Mak being sent home instead of Rowan is an absolute disgrace!' typed a different viewer.  </p>

<p>For the show-stopper, contestants had to make a 3D biscuit of a memorable meal which will deceives the eye and after a successful two rounds prior, Dave came out as star baker after impressing with his tacos inspired biscuit. </p>

<p>The Great British Bake Off continues on Channel 4 next Tuesday at 8pm.  </p>

<p>Over the moon: Dave came out as star baker after impressing with his tacos inspired biscuit</p>
