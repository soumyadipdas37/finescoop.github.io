        <p>The family of a Louisville police officer who is believed to have fired the shot that killed Breonna Taylor is trying to raise $75,000 to help him retire because he no longer feels safe on the force.  </p>

<p>An online fundraiser set up this week is seeking donations to help support Myles Cosgrove after he gives up his job because of the 'countless threats' he's received amid immense public outrage over his involvement in Taylor's killing.  </p>

<p>'The family of Detective Myles Cosgrove, an officer involved in the tragic Breonna Taylor case, is starting this fund in order to help secure the safety of Myles and his immediate family going forward,' a post on GiveSendGo reads.  </p>

<p>'It has recently become clear that it will be impossible for Myles to safely return to his position serving the community with the Louisville Metro Police Department.</p>

<p>'We hope to raise enough funds to help him purchase the remainder of his service time, or "air-time", so that he can retire from the LMPD and continue to focus on the safety of his family, a family that has been put continually at-risk over the past few months.' </p>

<p>Louisville Police Officer Myles Cosgrove (pictured) is looking to retire from the force after receiving 'countless threats' over his involvement in Breonna Taylor's killing, his family says</p>

<p>Breonna Taylor, 26, was shot and killed on March 13 when Cosgrove and two other Louisville police officers executed a 'no knock' narcotics warrant at her home</p>

<p>Cosgrove's family set up an online fundraiser this week to help him retire from the Louisville Metro Police Department because he no longer feels safe amid fevered outrage over his involvement in Taylor's killing</p>

<p>Cosgrove was one of three Louisville officers who fired shots while executing a 'no knock' narcotics warrant on March 13, striking the 26-year-old EMT six times.  </p>

<p>Last week a grand jury cleared Cosgrove and officers John Mattingly and Brett Hankison of charges in Taylor's death, ruling that they were justified in their use of force because the victim's boyfriend opened fire on them first without knowing they were police. </p>

<p>Hankison was the only officer to be charged over the incident as he was hit with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing shots into a neighbor's home.  </p>

<p>Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron discussed the findings of the grand jury investigation at a press conference last week, revealing that an FBI analysis confirmed that the fatal shot which struck Taylor near her heart had been fired by Cosgrove. </p>

<p>Cameron noted that a ballistics test performed prior to the FBI analysis failed to come to a conclusion about who fired the fatal shot.  </p>

<p>The grand jury decision sparked renewed fury among critics who have demanded justice in Taylor's killing - one of several this year that have highlighted police brutality against black Americans and sparked protests worldwide. </p>

<p>Last week a grand jury cleared Cosgrove and the other  two officers involved in the Taylor raid - John Mattingly (left) and Brett Hankison (right) - of charges in her death. Hankison was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment for firing bullets into a neighbor's home</p>

<p>But Cosgrove's family is now trying to paint him as a victim, saying that they have received 'countless threats' in the past several months.  </p>

<p>'Myles' reputation has been completely dismantled and the psychological trauma is something that he will have to cope with for the rest of his life,' the fundraiser states. </p>

<p>'Every day, the threats seem more legitimate and scarier; his family has been doxed and harassed, while the threats remain unrelenting. </p>

<p>'Although Myles may never feel completely safe again, if you can help us reach our goal, we can at least get him on a path to security and allow him to focus on his main objective: the safety of his family.'</p>

<p>The campaign, which has raised more than $7,000 toward its $75,000 goal as of Tuesday afternoon, came to light on Monday as new questions arose over Attorney General Daniel Cameron's handling of the case. </p>

<p>The full description on the GiveSendGo campaign by Cosgrove's family is shown above</p>

<p>Louisville police released this photo of Cosgrove on the night of the Taylor raid</p>

<p>One of the grand jurors involved in last week's long-awaited decision revealed they were not given the option to indict two of the three cops involved in Taylor's killing and said Cameron is misrepresenting their deliberations by claiming they were satisfied neither of the officers should be charged.</p>

<p>The juror made the claims in a court motion calling for Cameron to release all the evidence reviewed by the panel, which the attorney general later agreed to do. </p>

<p>Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (pictured) on Monday agreed to release transcripts of the grand jury proceedings</p>

<p>In a statement Monday night, Cameron acknowledged that he never asked the grand jury to consider homicide charges against the officers - only recommending a charge of wanton endangerment for Hankison.  </p>

<p>He had previously declined to provide details on what charges prosecutors brought to the grand jury to consider when it met last week.</p>

<p>Cameron said the grand jury is meant to be a 'secretive body', but said 'it's apparent that the public interest in this case isn't going to allow that to happen.'</p>

<p>He said a recording of the grand jury proceedings would be released Wednesday and assured that it would put speculation of misconduct to bed.</p>

<p>'Once the public listens to the recording, they will see that over the course of two-and-a-half days, our team presented a thorough and complete case to the grand jury,' Cameron said.</p>

<p>The attorney general also said he wouldn't object if members of the panel want to speak publicly about their grand jury experience. </p>

<p>In the early morning hours of March 13, officers from LMPD executed a search warrant at 3003 Springfield Drive, apartment 4. This was Ms Breonna Taylor's residence. </p>

<p>The officers were advised by superiors to knock and announce their presence in serving this specific search warrant. Scope of the investigation did not include the attainment of the warrant by the LMPD criminal interdiction division. Federal law enforcement partners are conducting that investigation. </p>

<p>Sergeant Mattingly and detectives Cosgrove and Hankison had no known involvement in the proceeding investigation or obtainment of the search warrant. They were called in to duty as the extra personnel to effectuate the service of the search warrant. They only had information conveyed to them in their prior briefing. They knock and announced the presence at the apart.</p>

<p>Their statement are corroborated by an independent witness near to the proximity of apartment 4. In other words, the warrant was not served as a no-knock warrant. When the officers were unable to get anyone to answer, or open the door to apartment 4, the decision was made to breach the door. </p>

<p>After breaching the door, Sergeant Mattingly was the first and the only officer to enter the residence. Sergeant Mattingly identified two individuals, standing beside one another at the end of the hall. Male and a female. In his statement he says that the male was holding a gun. Arms extended. In a shooting stance. </p>

<p>Sergeant Mattingly saw the man's gun fire, heard a boom. Immediately knew he was shot as a result of feeling heat in his upper thigh. Kenneth walker fired the shot that hit sergeant Mattingly.</p>

<p>There is no evidence to support that sergeant Mattingly was hit by friendly fire from other officers. Mr Walker admitted that he fired one shot and was the first one to shoot. In addition to all the testimony, the ballistics report shows the round that struck sergeant Mattingly was fired from a .9-millimeter handgun. </p>

<p>The LMPD officers fired .40-caliber handguns. Sergeant Mattingly returned fire down the hallway. Mattingly fired six shots. Almost simultaneously, detective Cosgrove also in the doorway, shot 16 times. This all took place in a matter of seconds. In total, six bullets struck Ms Taylor. Medical evidence obtained by the team indicates that only one shot was fatal. Further medical evidence shows Ms Taylor would have died from the fatal shot within a few seconds to two minutes after being struck. </p>

<p>Detective Hankison fired his weapon ten times including from an outside sliding glass door and through a bedroom window. Some bullets traveled through apartment four and in to apartment three before some exited that apartment. </p>

<p>At the time, three residents of apartment three were at home. Including a male, pregnant female, and a child. There is no conclusive evidence that any bullets fired from detective Hankison's weapon struck Ms Taylor. </p>

<p>The ballistics analysis did not identify which of the three officers fired the fatal shot. After receiving that information, I asked the FBI Crime lab to conduct its own analysis to see if they reach the same results. </p>

<p>The FBI Ballistics analysis concluded the fatal shot was fired by Detective Cosgrove. Our officers looked at both reports to determine if there were major differences in the procedures used by each lab that would have led the FBI to identify who fired the fatal shot. Both law enforcement agencies used similar equipment and analysis. Each lab is highly respected for their work. </p>

<p>There was nothing our investigators could point to nor anything provided by the respective agencies that directly explains why one lab made the call while another did not. </p>

<p>I think it is worth repeating again that our investigation found Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker. Secondary to this justification, the KSP and the FBI ballistics analysis reached different conclusions creating a reasonable doubt in the evidence about who fired the fatal shot. </p>

<p>I certainly understand the public's desires for answers and many have questioned the length of the investigation. Simply put, we had to try every means necessary to determine who fired the fatal shot before the investigation could be completed. </p>

<p>With a thorough and complete knowledge of evidence collected in this case, lawyers of special prosecutions presented the findings of the independent investigation before a grand jury comprised of Jefferson County residents beginning on Monday and concluding today.</p>
