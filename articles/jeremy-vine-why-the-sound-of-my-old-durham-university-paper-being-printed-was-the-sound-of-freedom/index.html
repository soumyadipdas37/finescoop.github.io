        <p>For me – as a doubt-racked teenager – seeing my byline was like finally finding evidence I actually existed. The thrill never went, writes Jeremy Vine</p>

<p>There is a certain TV presenter who makes me a little bit cross whenever I see them on the box. The reason goes back several years, as all the best grudges do. </p>

<p>In the shallows of our careers, the two of us had bumped into each other in a corridor and jealously compared notes. During the conversation I mentioned I had gone to Durham University.</p>

<p>‘Ah, me too,’ the other person said earnestly. </p>

<p>‘The student newspaper. Yep – being editor of that is definitely on my CV.’</p>

<p>‘Fantastic!’ I exclaimed, remembering long nights in the office of the paper, known as Palatinate. </p>

<p>‘I was editor too. In 1985. When did you do it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I never actually did it,’ came the answer. ‘I just put it on my CV.’</p>

<p>This seemed like a fraud of earth-bending magnitude, but I think the reason I felt especially sensitive is because you never stop being grateful to the first publication that puts your name in print.</p>

<p>Palatinate did that for me. The 72-year-old student paper is in the news itself now because Durham Students’ Union, which funds it, wants to stop the cash for its print edition.</p>

<p>To me, this is like telling a farmer he can’t keep any sheep but he can keep pictures of them. I am all for online news, but a paper needs printing or it’s not a paper.</p>

<p>The editors of the ink-starved publication contacted me with a private message on Twitter. To support them, I posted a gentle tweet. </p>

<p>‘The student newspaper has been printed for 72 years. Now the team have been told there is no budget for paper and ink. This is wrong, wrong, wrong.’</p>

<p>That tweet went a little bit crazy and caused what young people call a pile-on – if you haven’t heard the term before, it’s a bit like a pub brawl but without the beer glasses.</p>

<p>Part of the reason, I think, is that so many people now in top media jobs came through student newspapers. But the indignation was also fuelled by a very old-fashioned thought – the sound of a newspaper being printed is the sound of freedom.</p>

<p>When I was editor, we ran regular exposés on the people who ran the students’ union – ardent Left-wingers who all seemed to become management consultants on graduation. Jeremy Vine is pictured far left with student journalists at Durham’s Palatinate newspaper in 1984</p>

<p>I rang Imogen Usherwood, one of Palatinate’s joint editors, to ask why any aspiring journalist in 2020 would still want to see their work in print, rather than just online.</p>

<p>The answer gave me heart. ‘Having Palatinate printed means we have a physical presence on campus – in libraries, cafes, buildings and so on, which can’t really be matched online or with social media. When something is printed, you know it has to be right. Things can’t be altered later on, which holds us to account.’</p>

<p>For me – as a doubt-racked teenager – seeing my byline was like finally finding evidence I actually existed. The thrill never went. After graduating, I made a beeline for newspapers.</p>

<p>In 1986, the Coventry Evening Telegraph gave me my first job as a trainee reporter on a salary of £6,200 a year. There were no computers in the newsroom, just banks of manual typewriters with 85 journalists sweating buckets over them. </p>

<p>And when I went out of the building at the end of the day to collect my bicycle, I walked past roaring presses on which I could sometimes see a flash of my latest article.</p>

<p>I have no idea what motivated the current crew at the students’ union (a mixture of paid staff and recent graduates) to turn off the printers. But in the 1980s, when I was there studying English literature – actually, ‘studying’ is a slight exaggeration – the tension between the newspaper and the union was so real you could smell it.</p>

<p>It became clear to me the students’ union was full of people who were basically doing a full-time degree in hating Mrs Thatcher.</p>

<p>She had just breezed into her second term, which had completely flummoxed them.</p>

<p>Back then, if you loathed Thatcher you were described as ‘sound’. If you loved her – about eight students in the entire university did – you were known as a ‘nutter’.</p>

<p>Student politics was never very grown-up, and I kept out of it.</p>

<p>The problem comes when a student newspaper is funded by a student body. When I was editor, we ran regular exposés on the people who ran the students’ union – ardent Left-wingers who all seemed to become management consultants on graduation.</p>

<p>On one occasion they had been angry at the university authorities and resigned en masse. When I declared this was ‘not a big story’ and relegated it to an inside page, they were furious. The penny dropped. They thought we only existed to tell the rest of the university how good they were.</p>

<p>At Durham I fell in love, discovered poetry and edited the student paper, and the greatest of these was… well, let’s just say finding the newspaper was like finding love.</p>

<p>If I close my eyes and breathe deeply, I can actually smell the inked golf ball which spun like a wizard’s orb in the hollow of our electric typewriter and was the closest thing we had to new technology. </p>

<p>The room, possibly the messiest in County Durham, was tucked away at the back of the drab students’ union building. The carpet was smudged with stubbed cigarettes and the walls painted vomit yellow.</p>

<p>It didn’t matter. A dozen of us would find our way there every week like children entering a Christmas grotto and eagerly bash out our stories.</p>

<p>We would then – the absence of technology was truly stunning – glue the paragraphs to large pieces of card which would be shuttled to a local printer in a car.</p>

<p>At Durham I fell in love, discovered poetry and edited the student paper, and the greatest of these was… well, let’s just say finding the newspaper was like finding love</p>

<p>It was the opposite of the internet. But friendships for life were forged there.</p>

<p>Joel Donovan (whose first words to me in 1984 were: ‘You’ve got a lot to learn’) ended up as a QC.</p>

<p>Richard Calland, the sports editor, who once arrived in the office at midnight wearing a trilby and fell across the photocopier in a drunken haze, is now a distinguished academic. Wendy Pilmer ran BBC Newcastle and then became a gardener. Tim Burt made a fortune in public relations.</p>

<p>Among other alumni are the impressive George Alagiah, Hunter Davies and Cristina Nicolotti, who runs a chunk of Sky News.</p>

<p>Sir Harold Evans was an editor of Palatinate before his legendary career on Fleet Street.</p>

<p>A lot of us seem to feel something big is happening here. Sure, this precious newspaper can just be another lump of colour on a student smartphone, but then it will be lost.</p>

<p>In the story of Palatinate we have a kind of miracle – 21st Century students, those digital natives we are told will live their lives packing every kind of tech imaginable, still get the greatest thrill from seeing their name in print on a large piece of folding paper.</p>

<p>And so long as the newspaper itself doesn’t fold, there is hope.</p>

<p>BBC presenter Jeremy Vine’s new novel, The Diver And The Lover, published by Hachette UK, is out now. The fee for this article has been donated to Palatinate.</p>
