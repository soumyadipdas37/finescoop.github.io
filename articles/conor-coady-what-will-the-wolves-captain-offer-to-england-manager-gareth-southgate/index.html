    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Having recently secured a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad, Conor Coady's has become somewhat of a fan favourite already.</p>

<p>Wolves supporters have long called for Coady's inclusion in the England setup after leading by example under Nuno Espirito Santo and establishing himself as one of England's top centre-halves. Although the 27-year-old has been frequently overlooked due to the style of football Southgate has deployed during his four years in charge.</p>

<p>However, Coady has been handed his maiden Three Lions squad this week's Nations League matches with Iceland and Denmark to fill the void left by Harry Maguire's withdrawal.</p>

<p>Wolves captain Conor Coady has been called up to Gareth Southgate's England squad</p>

<p>Coady's reaction to the call-up was what grabbed the attention of the fans, as the Englishman said the news reduced his wife, Amy, and his parents to tears of joy.</p>

<p>The defender went on to say he was 'shaking' when he received the news, claiming it is a moment he will 'never forget for the rest of his life as it was incredible'. </p>

<p>But what has led Coady to this moment? Why has he been overlooked so many times and what will he offer England? </p>

<p>Sportsmail take a detailed look at the debutante's career and outline what fans can expect to see with their new addition.</p>

<p>A Liverpool fan from a young age, Coady started his career in the Reds academy system before progressing into Brendan Rodgers' first-team.</p>

<p>Coady was handed his debut during Liverpool's 1-0 defeat by Anzhi Makhachkala in Russia on November 8, 2012 and went on to make four more match-day squads.</p>

<p>Out of those four opportunities, the youngster only made it onto the pitch for a second time when he came on as a late substitute during their win at Fulham in May. </p>

<p>Coady's Liverpool dream was cut short when he was left out of the squad that was selected to travel to Indonesia in 2013.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the youngster signed a six-month-loan deal with League One club Sheffield United. </p>

<p>Coady captained the Liverpool U18's and later featured twice for the Liverpool first-team</p>

<p>Coady was not selected to travel to Indonesia for the Liverpool first-team's tour in July 2013</p>

<p>Coady said he was 'always realistic' and felt it was time to move on from Liverpool to get regular first-team experience. </p>

<p>He said: 'Brendan Rodgers was good to me when I was young. I had a season training with the first-team at Melwood, and learning off them, that was big for me, but I always knew it was tough. I was always realistic, I was learning a lot off the first-team, how to play and do things.</p>

<p>'I knew at some point I'd have to come away from Liverpool to really experience being a first-team player. It was the best decision I ever made, and Brendan Rodgers was great for that; he pushed that to send me on loan and try to improve my game.</p>

<p>'Even being on loan at Sheffield United (in 2013-14), I loved the season and it was a great club for me to go to, coming back I still knew it was going to be tough. </p>

<p>'Liverpool were always getting better, they were always improving, and the players in my position were ridiculous. But I just wanted to play football. I knew where I was at, the type of level I was at, but I just wanted to be part of a first-team, playing in games which meant something, playing against men.' </p>

<p>After being left out of the Indonesia squad, Coady joined Sheffield United on loan in 2013</p>

<p>After leaving Liverpool, Coady went on to be a big success at Sheffield United - scoring five times in 39 appearances.</p>

<p>He also featured in eight FA Cup-ties and reached the semi-final stage of the competition before crashing out against Hull City.</p>

<p>As a consequence, his loan period was extended the day before his 21st birthday and lasted until 2014.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2014 Coady made the switch to Huddersfield Town in the Championship for a transfer fee of £2million.</p>

<p>After a short stint under Mark Robins, Coady later went on to join Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2015 and has since established himself as one of the most consistent centre-halves in the English game. </p>

<p>In the summer of 2014 Coady transferred to Huddersfield Town in the Championship for £2m</p>

<p>The starlet even captained Wolves to promotion back into the top-flight during their 2017-18 campaign.</p>

<p>His leadership and organisation have been repeatedly praised by team-mates and staff over the years.</p>

<p>Reflecting on Coady's ability to unit his squad, former Wolves star Dave Edwards said: 'Conor has always been a leader. He's so vocal - such a big talker.</p>

<p>'He's like that every single day in the dressing room, and such a happy guy as well, always having a smile on his face.</p>

<p>'That raises the energy in training and around the place, even when you've lost a game.</p>

<p>'Conor was the natural choice for Nuno, and he has revelled in the centre of defence. It was a natural option. He can see the pitch from there and organise.</p>

<p>'He has been a leader since he was a teenager, captaining England at youth level. I just hope he gets a chance at senior level with England now.'</p>

<p>Since arriving at Wolves, Coady had developed his leadership skills under Nuno Espirito Santo</p>

<p> Former Wolves star Dave Edwards says that Coady has always had leadership abilities </p>

<p>Coady's leadership qualities are not only apparent through what he says, but how he acts.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old has played every single minute of every Wolves game in the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League this season since they started with a 2-0 win over Crusaders in the second qualifying round on July 25.</p>

<p>The only games Coady has been spared were two ties in the Carabao Cup, but the defender's marathon endeavours go back a long way before that.</p>

<p>The 4,950 minutes he has completed this season - plus much more if you include stoppage time - came off the back of a 2018-19 campaign in which he played every competitive minute for Wolves in league and cup.</p>

<p>The last time Coady was absent from a Wolves league fixture was way back on September 30, 2017, when a suspension for a red card kept him out of a 4-0 win over Burton Albion in the Championship.</p>

<p>Jamie Carragher has been wanting the 27-year-old to be recognised by England for years</p>

<p>Coady replaced Harry Maguire, who withdrew following his conviction for Mykonos brawl</p>

<p>Coady - who has taken the same path as Jamie Carragher by going through the academy system at Liverpool and moving from midfield to defence - says he would be 'delighted' to achieve what the Sky Sports pundit has.</p>

<p>He said: 'I know Jamie Carragher did a similar thing by playing in midfield for the U18's and then moving into defence - if I can do half as well as he has done I'll be delighted.' </p>

<p>As it stands, Coady is on track to replicate the former England man's success, having earned his first call-up to represent his country.</p>

<p>The Wolves captain will be part of the England squad who face Iceland in Reykjavik on September 5 before playing Denmark in Copenhagen three days later. </p>

<p>Coady is a direct replacement for Harry Maguire, who was withdrawn from the squad by manager Southgate after being given a suspended prison sentence in Greece.</p>

<p>However, it is Coady's humble approach to his England debut that has seen him become a fan favourite.  </p>

<p>Coady has previously represented and captained England at youth level - U17 and U20</p>

<p>In April, Coady was asked about being called up to the England squad, he said: 'It's always in your head, how amazing it would be to play for your country. It's something you think about and dream about, it's the pinnacle of any Englishman's career.</p>

<p>'Do I think about ever really getting into the squad? No, I'm quite realistic of where I am and I just focus on the situation I'm in. If I start thinking about certain things that aren't here, I'll be disappointed if they don't come. So I make sure I don't, and focus on Wolves and getting better, and as long as I'm doing that, that's all I'm happy about.</p>

<p>'Do I think about it, do I think it would be amazing? Of course, it's the pinnacle of any Englishman's career, but I would never put pressure on myself to say, "I need to start playing well here because the national team manager's here." Because if I don't get in I'll be disappointed. It's not something I think about often really.'</p>

<p>Much to Coady's delight he is now making his first senior squad appearance after previously represented England at youth level - captaining the side that won the 2010 UEFA European U17 Championship in Liechtenstein and became the first England team to win an international tournament in 17 years. </p>

<p>He earned at total of 17 caps for the U17's before being named as England's captain for the U20 World Cup in Turkey. </p>

<p>Coady has a better success rate with his long passes than Liverpool defender Virgil Van Dijk</p>

<p>He turns defence into an attack within an instant by firing balls out to Adama Traore at Wolves</p>

<p>At senior level, Coady has impressed the England manager during his time as Wolves - with his statistics proving that he has a better success rate with his long passes than the likes of Premier League champion Virgil Van Dijk.</p>

<p>Coady's ability to turn defence into an attack within an instant has become a specialty as he frequently finds Matt Doherty or Adama Traore on the flank.  </p>

<p>However, England's tendency to play four at the back had stripped him of international recognition.  </p>

<p>Having finally broken into the squad,  Coady has made it clear he is not in England's squad to make up the numbers as he targets a cap to achieve his boyhood dream.</p>

<p>He said: 'Caps for England would be incredible, the pinnacle of any Englishman's career. I know in my own head that is something I want to do - and everybody's fighting to do it. I need to be ready if that time ever comes.' </p>
