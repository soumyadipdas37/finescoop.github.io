        <p>Louise Thompson has been getting very philosophical of late - posting to social media with thought-provoking captions.</p>

<p>The latest, on Twitter, accompanied a trio of shots of the Made In Chelsea star, 30, posing in skimpy swimwear by the pool.</p>

<p>Basking in the sun, she captioned the images: 'Always practice self-love. Hating your body will never get you as far as loving it will.'</p>

<p>Strike a pose: Louise Thompson posted a trio of shots in skimpy swimwear by the pool on Wednesday</p>

<p>She showed off her famously athletic frame in the snaps, taken during her recent trip abroad.</p>

<p>Louise wore a leopard print two-piece and swept her mane back from her face as she looked out to sea.</p>

<p>She lay on a pier, blue skies in the backdrop, adding shades to her beachy get-up.</p>

<p>She accessoried with a necklace and bracelets, flexing her taut stomach muscles in the swimwear. </p>

<p>Basking in the sun, she captioned the images: 'Always practice self-love. Hating your body will never get you as far as loving it will'</p>

<p>Sun-kissed: She showed off her famously athletic frame in the snaps, taken during her recent trip abroad</p>

<p>A day before, she posted a cryptic tweet about infidelity, just a week after penning a post about 'cheaters'.</p>

<p>Louise, who has been engaged to Ryan Libbey for two years, shared a tweet about having her heart 'cheated, burned and broken,' catching the eyes of her fans.</p>

<p>Louise wrote: 'I'm proud of my heart. It's been played, stabbed, cheated, burned and broken... somehow still works.'</p>

<p>Outspoken: Louise posted another cryptic tweet about infidelity, just a week after penned a post about 'cheaters'</p>

<p>Odd: The former Made In Chelsea star who has been engaged to Ryan Libbey for two years, shared a tweet about having her heart 'cheated, burned and broken'</p>

<p>Louise did not offer any further details about who her tweet was referring to, but a source told MailOnline: 'Things between Louise and Ryan are really great. Her tweet was actually aimed at a friend.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted her representative for further comment. </p>

<p>The post comes less than a week after Louise raised eyebrows with her first cryptic tweet, writing: 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful.' </p>

<p>Having shot to fame on the E4 show in 2011, Louise became part of a central storyline due to her romance with love rat Spencer Matthews, leading to speculation from fans that the tweet was about her ex. </p>

<p>Happy: Louise and Ryan announced their engagement in 2018, but have previously postponed their wedding</p>

<p>Come again? The post comes less than a week after Louise raised eyebrows with her first cryptic tweet, writing: 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful'</p>

<p>Louise's tweet came just hours after she enjoyed a family dinner with Ryan and her brother Sam Thompson, which she documented on Instagram. </p>

<p>In April, Louise admitted she's 'working on her relationship' with fiancé Ryan and they still haven't made plans for their wedding.</p>

<p>The star, who got engaged to Ryan in 2018, told MailOnline 'I am just not sure exactly what I want yet' after cancelling her big day last December. </p>

<p>In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'</p>

<p>Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'At the beginning it wasn't that easy but we've had to make a really conscious effort to make some changes. </p>

<p>Jump! Amid her unusual posts, Louise did share a fun video from her sunny getaway with fiancé Ryan, as they performed a backflip</p>

<p>Smooth moves: The pair launched themselves from the edge of the beat in the middle of the ocean</p>

<p>Way back when: On MIC, Louise became part of a central storyline due to her romance with love rat Spencer Matthews, leading to speculation from fans that the tweet was about her ex</p>

<p>'We are actively working on our relationship now. For the first couple of years in a relationship you're still in that love phase, there are still new things to experience. </p>

<p>We've been together for four and a half years now and you do go through phases. You have to try a bit harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.</p>

<p>'We are communicating more and having chats about what each other wants, so now we have set some boundaries.'</p>

<p>The pair had booked to marry at London's Kew Gardens in December 2019 but cancelled their plans, with Louise saying: 'It's just the bigger picture for myself and Ryan that we need to get to grips with first.'</p>

<p>Months later, Ryan revealed they had agreed on a venue in Ibiza for their wedding to go ahead in spring 2020 – but now Louise says they're still 'figuring out what it is we want' and their plans have come to a halt. </p>

<p>The family! Louise's first tweet came just hours after she enjoyed a family dinner with Ryan and her brother Sam Thompson, which she documented on Instagram</p>

<p>She said: 'No… actually, we haven't, we are still sort of figuring out what it is we want to do because we're so busy with the business.</p>

<p>'I am someone that really wants to have the best day ever and I want to be in the right space, I am just not sure exactly what I want yet.'</p>

<p>In May Louise also revealed their relationship has been positively affected by the 'claustrophobic' times during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The fitness brand owner shared a sweet picture of herself and Ryan, 29, cuddled up in their garden alongside a lengthy caption about how they have faired in isolation.</p>

<p>Louise admitted that although the situation has been 'tough' at times, she feels that they made come out of lockdown 'happier than before'. </p>

<p>Work harder: In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other'</p>

<p>The reality star said that she feels like she 'knows' her other half again, after working on being able to listen to each other during their time at home.</p>

<p>She said: 'Haven't posted a photo of us together in months. Which is nuts because we've been confined in the same space for what feels like a lifetime.'</p>

<p>'People always ask how we live together, workout together, run a couple of businesses together, cook together, do jobs together, travel etc etc, you get the drill.</p>

<p>Louise explained that it was down to Ryan's 'good qualities' that their relationship works, adding: 'The truth is it's because of him. Im very lucky that I found the yin to my yang.</p>

<p>'He's super chilled, modest, grounded, dedicated, balanced, selfless and basically the dream human, but more than that he possesses all the good qualities that I lack. I have good qualities too, but we have different ones, so we're a good match.' </p>

<p>Love: She also admitted that although the situation has been 'tough' at times, she feels that they made come out of lockdown 'happier than before'</p>

<p>Going on to detail their occasional struggles, she said: 'It's been a little tough/claustrophobic being stuck in someone's company for so long, but I feel like this last couple of weeks has forced us to actually stop and think about what's important to us and to create new boundaries. </p>

<p>'We've been forced to have more conversations in this last month than we have during the 4/5 years we've been together.</p>

<p>'We've actually listened to each other (im really trying to work on listening more), and we've made A LOT of changes to our relationship. </p>

<p>'I think we might actually come out of this happier than before. I feel like I know you again.</p>

<p>She ended the post by writing: '#everycloud.'⁣⁣</p>

<p>Committed: Louise admitted she's 'working on her relationship' with Ryan and they still haven't made plans for their wedding after getting engaged in 2018</p>

<p>Louise jetted to Mykonos with her fiancé Ryan, brother Sam Thompson and his girlfriend Zara McDermott last month.  </p>

<p>The star has found a love for fitness and has even launched her own platform Live Like Louise but she recently said she 'wouldn't be here anymore' had she not learnt how to to deal with online criticism.</p>

<p>The fitness-enthusiast star of Made In Chelsea spoke about trolls in a chat with The Sun, and admitted: 'I don't let things like that affect me in the way I used to. If I did, I don't even know if I would be here any more.' </p>

<p>She went on: 'Social media lures you in and it's got all the ingredients for something really unhealthy. It's the comparisons, the likes, the validation.  </p>

<p>'But I've reached a place where I am happy the way I am. The moment you fall into the trap of wanting to look like someone else then it's never-ending. It's really damaging and it's petrifying.'  </p>

<p>She added: 'When I wake up, I look like a naked mole-rat! But I have a shower, click my fingers and think: 'I'm going to turn this day around. I feel hot. I feel good. I feel confident and I know I look good!'</p>

<p>She was recently forced to hit back at trolls who accused her of 'editing' her 'muscle bod' following a 90-day fitness regime.  </p>

<p>The TV star was encouraged to embark on a healthier lifestyle when she first started dating fiancé Ryan in 2016, and has since adopted her own love for fitness.</p>

<p>Happy: Louise said that she feels like she 'knows' her other half again, after working on being able to listen to each other during their time at home (pictured in 2017)</p>
