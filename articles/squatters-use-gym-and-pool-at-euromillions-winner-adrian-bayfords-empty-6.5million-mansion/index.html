    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>EuroMillions winner Adrian Bayford has stepped up security at his empty £6.5million mansion he bought with his £148m jackpot - which is now listed for sale after squatters used his gym and pool.</p>

<p>Mr Bayford, 49, is selling the £6.5million Grade II manor house in Linton, Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>He has now had to increase security after intruders started using the impressive home for themselves, breaking into his personal leisure centre, The Sun reports. </p>

<p>Warning signs and guards are now being employed to stop further intrusions while £148million EuroMillions winner Mr Bayford tries to sell the estate. </p>

<p>Security lights on the mansion are being left on throughout the day and an on-site guard is keeping watch on the grounds.</p>

<p>A small gate leading up to the property has been closed and a sign warns that the grounds are being monitored 24/7.</p>

<p>A friend said: 'These squatters have been in and out of his outdoor pool and having a great time.</p>

<p>'Luckily they've not been able to get into the main house as it's all locked up as you'd expect.</p>

<p>'But Adrian won't be happy at all to know what's been happening whilst he's more than 400 miles away.'</p>

<p>Adrian Bayford, 49, is selling the £6.5million Grade II manor house in Linton, Cambridgeshire. He has now had to increase security after intruders started using the impressive home for themselves, breaking into his personal leisure centre</p>

<p>Friends say he is keen to sell as quickly as possible having suffered heartbreak there with Gillian, from whom he split the following year because of the stress of the win</p>

<p>A security firm has been hired to protect EuroMillions winner Adrian Bayford's Grade II manor house in Linton, Cambridgeshire after squatters got in and used his pool</p>

<p>Mr Bayford has left the mansion and is thought to have moved to Scotland, but a security guard remains on site, with his car parked on the driveway</p>

<p>A passing cyclist, who lives in Haverhill, said: 'I’m not surprised he’s got security there - it’s a lovely mansion that he’s hoping to sell for a not very small fortune, so it makes sense.</p>

<p>'It’s amazing to think that people were cheeky enough to try and have a swim but now word is out I don’t think it will be happening again.</p>

<p>'Adrian is a really well-known character and it was public knowledge that he’d gone to Scotland, so they must have thought they’d try their luck and have a dip.' </p>

<p>The stepped-up security remains in place with a guard on site, his car parked on the driveway. </p>

<p>Another sign warns: “Warning - this property is patrolled by guard dogs’.</p>

<p>The house is covered with security cameras, with at least two cameras overlooking the driveway.</p>

<p>The friend added that Mr Bayford would have to spend 'even more money' watching the estate, which he has already 'thrown so much money at'.</p>

<p>The home is said to have too many 'sad memories' for the lottery winner, who paid £6,085,250 for the country estate with then wife Gillian after their win in 2012. </p>

<p>The pressure of the massive windfall ended their marriage and Gillian moved away while her husband remained in the eight-bedroom property. </p>

<p>Mr Bayford was earlier this month given the go-ahead to sell the sprawling £6.5m estate following an installation of a state-of-the-art games room he built without planning permission.</p>

<p>The multi millionaire had faced being told to tear down the building which he had converted into a snooker room and home cinema complete with a bar and serving counter.</p>

<p>But now local planners have said the games room can stay provided he carries out alterations that make the outbuilding look more in keeping with the historic character of his Grade II manor house in Linton, Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>Signage on a gate outside the mansion has warned people to stay away and declares that guard dogs are on patrol. Axe Professional Security has been guarding the property for at least four weeks</p>

<p>He put the seven-bed mansion on the market earlier this year - but inflation means the sale is set to lose him nearly £1million</p>

<p>The father-of-two put it on the market for £6.5million earlier this year. To match inflation, he would have to sell the 189-acre property for £7,239,896.</p>

<p>The decision means the 49-year-old former postman can push ahead with the sale of the property having already moved out and relocated to Scotland to be closer to his two children and ex-wife. </p>

<p>Axe Professional Security is providing the cover for the Georgian mansion.</p>

<p>According to the company’s instagram feed, they’ve been there for at least four weeks, with pictures posted of the mansion both during the day and at night.</p>

<p>Now Mr Bayford is so desperate to get shot of the mansion that hold unhappy memories for him that he is selling at a £1million loss.</p>

<p>During his time living at the property, ex-wife Gillian divorced him, a fiancée called of their engagement and two girlfriends have dumped him.</p>

<p>He put it on the market for £6.5million earlier this year. To match inflation, he would have to sell the 189-acre property for £7,239,896.</p>

<p>But the dispute over planning permission would likely have put off any potential buyers.</p>

<p>A disused garage was converted into a games room and he also built a swimming pool without planning permission from south Cambridgeshire council.</p>

<p>A stumbling block to any proposed sale has been work the millionaire carried out on a crumbling garage (pictured)</p>

<p>Bayford upgraded the outbuilding (pictured above with new wooden doors) by turning it into a state-of-the-art games room. But he carried out the work without planning permission, which may have put off potential buyers of the listed property</p>

<p>After offering to carry out work that would restore the outside of the building (above) to its original character, including replacing terracotta ridge tiles and painting new facias and timber black, retrospective planning permission was granted</p>

<p>Bayford applied for retrospective planning permission and was granted approval for the pool – but had the games room rejected as the exterior was not in keeping with the heritage of the listed estate.</p>

<p>He re-applied for permission and submitted plans offering to carry out work that would restore the outside of the building to its original character, including replacing terracotta ridge tiles and painting new facias and timber black.</p>

<p>That move convinced planning chiefs to rule the conversion can stand, saying: ‘Concerns were raised by the Historic Buildings Officer to the original plans submitted with the application. However, these concerns have now been addressed through the submission of revised details.</p>

<p>‘The programme of works now proposed are considered to mitigate the unauthorised works that have been carried out to the building which are considered to detract from the significance of the designated heritage asset.</p>

<p>‘The works are now considered to result in a building which contributes positively to the legibility, character and appearance of the Horseheath Lodge estate group.’ </p>

<p>Adrian left the property earlier this year and moved to Scotland to live closer to his ex-wife Gillian, 48, and their two children </p>

<p>The property with its stunning garden (pictured) carries with it some bad memories for Adrian - it's where he lived when he divorced Gillian and a fiancee called off their engagement, plus it's where two more relationships broke down for him </p>

<p>The seven-bedroom Grade II listed property includes this sumptuous bathroom and is set in 189 acres of land with stables </p>

<p>Bayford has suffered years of bad luck and romantic heartbreak since the win and splitting with his wife who returned to Dundee in Scotland with their children.</p>

<p>He got engaged to stable girl Samantha Burbidge, who was 20 years younger, after a six-week relationship, but she walked out on him after a few months.</p>

<p>He was also dumped by Polish factory worker Marta Jarosz, 35, and waitress Lisa Kemp, 40.</p>

<p>The former music shop owner has also allegedly fallen out with his friends including the director of the Cambridge Rock festival which he hosted on his lawn in 2017.</p>

<p>He bought a local village pub The Rose and Crown for £375,00 but was said to rarely visit after reportedly falling out with bar staff.</p>

<p>Bayford first put his sprawling estate up for sale two years ago but failed to get a buyer.</p>

<p>Earlier this year he moved up to Dundee where his ex-wife and her second husband live in a Victorian mansion.</p>

<p>The estate also has a large number of outbuildings, in particular a modern barn with space for offices, storage or further accommodation subject to planning consent</p>

<p>It has a history of involvement with horses and still retains a number of equestrian facilities including many stables and a dis-used menage</p>

<p>He wanted to live closer to his children so he spent £2.5million on two country piles in a week.</p>

<p>He splashed out £1.35million on a four-bedroom home with a rooftop garden and gym.</p>
