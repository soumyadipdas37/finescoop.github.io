        <p>He transformed Britain’s sense of style, and Sir Terence Conran will leave this world in similarly spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>I hear the business genius, who died last weekend aged 88, left instructions that his ashes should be sent into the sky and exploded in a fireworks display at his Berkshire home.</p>

<p>‘I have asked a fireworks company to put my ashes in a collection of rockets, so I think the right tune is Handel’s firework music,’ Conran had said. </p>

<p>He transformed Britain’s sense of style, and Sir Terence Conran will leave this world in similarly spectacular fashion</p>

<p>‘I love fireworks. I have left a lump of money in my will to be used for a goodbye party. I’d like it to happen at my house in the country. Over a river is always one of the best ways of watching the fireworks.’</p>

<p>A member of his family tells me: ‘If that’s what he wanted, that’s what he will get, come hell or high water.’</p>

<p>They will have to decide whether to hold a gathering of no more than six people or wait until they can celebrate with more of his friends and family.</p>

<p>I hear the business genius, who died last weekend aged 88, left instructions that his ashes should be sent into the sky and exploded in a fireworks display at his Berkshire home. The New Year's Eve fireworks in 2016 are pictured above</p>

<p>Habitat founder Conran, who once claimed he’d ‘undoubtedly changed the sex life of Europe’ by his promotion of the duvet, had two sons, Sebastian and Jasper, with his second wife, the Superwoman author Shirley Conran. He had another three — Tom, Sophie and Edmund — with his third wife Caroline. His widow is interior designer Victoria Davis.</p>

<p>A fireworks spectacular would be an appropriate way to remember colourful Conran, whose impact on British life ranged from being a trendsetter and tastemaker to millions, to a property developer and restaurateur.</p>

<p>People often remarked that he had more good meals and good wine, more money and more wives than most men would manage in several lifetimes.</p>

<p>A fireworks spectacular would be an appropriate way to remember colourful Conran, whose impact on British life ranged from being a trendsetter and tastemaker to millions, to a property developer and restaurateur. He is pictured above looking at a shelving design in 1955 with then wife Shirley</p>

<p>Prince Harry’s newly engaged pal</p>

<p>Her leading man: Kitty (above left) with Daisy</p>

<p>First Prince Harry married an actress; now one of his chums has bagged a real-life James Bond.</p>

<p>Kitty Jenks — whose brother-in-law, Charlie van Straubenzee, is godfather to Harry’s son, Archie — has become engaged to dashing Max Wrey.</p>

<p>Max, 30, works in the intelligence business in the Middle East and North Africa. </p>

<p>He runs his own consultancy company and has a ‘background in performing cross-border investigations, security and political risk analysis’, styling himself ‘Mohammed Wrey’ on social media. Kitty declares: ‘I’m marrying my Mohammed.’</p>

<p>An alumna of £37,200-a-year Bedales school, Kitty set up a video company, Jenks &amp; Co, with her sister, Daisy.</p>

<p>They were hired to film a Christmas party in 2018, hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, for the families of Armed Forces personnel.</p>

<p>Kitty met Max when she filmed his brother’s wedding.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson’s former lover Petronella Wyatt has made the outrageous claim that he delayed the ‘rule of six’ until after the christening of his four-month-old son.</p>

<p>The PM and fiancee Carrie had the service last Saturday, two days before the new restrictions kicked in.</p>

<p>‘The “rule of six” was announced on September 9, but not enforced until nearly a week later,’ says Petronella. </p>

<p>‘Unkind Tory MPs suggest the delay was to allow Johnson and Carrie to hold a large christening party for their son. People can be so mean!’</p>

<p>Downing Street sources said Wilfred was baptised in front of ‘a few family members and close friends’, but there was no reception afterwards because the couple wanted to set a good example to the public.</p>

<p>Did Sir Elton John inspire hip-hop music?</p>

<p>He claims one of his 1970s hits helped spawn a genre. ‘Bennie And The Jets is a real precursor to hip-hop,’ Sir Elton says. </p>

<p>‘It was my first hit on the black and R&amp;B charts. ‘I was a white boy from Pinner at No. 1 on the black charts.’</p>

<p>Blue-blooded beefcake Arthur Chatto has apparently taken inspiration from his relation Peter Phillips, whose money-making schemes have included appearing in a milk advert on Chinese television. </p>

<p>Chatto, who is Princess Margaret’s grandson, is only 21 and still a student at Edinburgh University, but he’s already signed promotional deals with car manufacturer Land Rover and energy snacks firm Kendal Mint Co., I can reveal.</p>

<p>Arthur, who recently rowed around Britain, filmed with Land Rover this week, describing it as a ‘fun day out’.</p>

<p>Having banked an estimated £48 million from his motoring shows, petrolhead Jeremy Clarkson is determined to make an unlikely second fortune from his farm.</p>

<p>I hear the former Top Gear motormouth, 60, has applied to trademark the name of his 1,000-acre Cotswolds farm, Diddly Squat, for a huge range of goods. The application to the Intellectual Property Office in London includes everything from meat, fish, poultry, game and ready meals to tote bags, backpacks, beers, spirits and liqueurs.</p>

<p>Clarkson moved to the property near Chipping Norton in 2009 and is making a television series about it for Amazon Prime, called I Bought A Farm. He opened a village store, Squat Shop, earlier this year. </p>

<p>But its makeshift car park turned into a quagmire as locals roared in to snap up water labelled ‘It’s got no s**t in it’, and potatoes which, Clarkson promised, were cheaper than Aldi’s.</p>

<p>Royal pal Charlie Gilkes has come up with an ingenious way of luring diners back to his restaurant Bunga Bunga, a favourite haunt of the Queen’s granddaughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.</p>

<p>He’s installed shower units inside the dining room where guests can sing karaoke while abiding by social-distancing rules. He calls it ‘karasoaky’.</p>

<p>‘Who doesn’t love singing in the shower?’ Gilkes tells me.</p>

<p>‘We’re trying to be as creative as we can. It’s working quite well. The showerhead is a microphone and we have three cubicles, so you can have three people singing a song together.’</p>

<p>The Italian-themed restaurant in London’s Battersea has instructed staff to dress up as cleaners to sanitise the cubicles between singing sessions.</p>

<p>Zoe Ball’s £1 million pay rise has left former BBC star DJ ‘Diddy’ David Hamilton aghast</p>

<p>Zoe Ball’s £1 million pay rise has left former BBC star DJ ‘Diddy’ David Hamilton aghast. </p>

<p>‘When I did a daily show for Radio 1 and Radio 2 in the Seventies and Eighties I was paid so little that I was out on the road doing clubs and discos three nights a week to earn a decent living,’ he tells me.</p>

<p>‘In those days, the BBC was very careful with its money.’</p>

<p>Ball’s Radio 2 show lost a million listeners after she took over from Chris Evans.</p>

<p>Hamilton adds of his later days in commercial radio: ‘Anyone losing a million listeners would have been gone overnight.’</p>

<p>Hollywood public relations firm Sunshine Sachs is not big enough for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p>

<p>I hear the couple, who signed a reported £100 million television deal with streaming giant Netflix, are also seeking to recruit a highly paid head of communications for their charitable foundation Archewell.</p>

<p>‘It’s such a shame Sara Latham no longer works for them,’ a source tells me. ‘She would have been perfect.’</p>

<p>U.S.-born Latham was recruited by Harry and Meghan as their head of communications after their wedding, but was among 15 loyal members of staff made redundant when they stepped down as working royals. She was immediately snapped up by the Queen’s private office to advise it on special projects.</p>

<p>Society ventriloquist Nina Conti has discovered marriage is no laughing matter.</p>

<p>The daughter of Shirley Valentine star Tom Conti has split with her husband, the stand-up comedian Andrew ‘Stan’ Stanley.</p>

<p>‘We have been separated for a while now,’ confirms Nina, 47, who has two children with Stanley, 46. But she adds: ‘We have a good relationship. We meet up a lot. We are happy co-parents.’</p>

<p>Nina performed at Prince Harry’s 30th birthday party. When she gave a surprise after-dinner show at the Queen’s 90th at Windsor Castle, Harry acted as the dummy and was ‘genuinely brilliant’, a guest claimed.</p>

<p>Chilling as serial killer Dennis Nilsen in this week’s accclaimed ITV drama Des, David Tennant admits the role left his wife, Georgia Moffett (pictured right with him), horrified</p>

<p>Chilling as serial killer Dennis Nilsen in this week’s accclaimed ITV drama Des, David Tennant admits the role left his wife, Georgia Moffett (pictured right with him), horrified.</p>

<p>Asked about the impact on family life of researching ‘unapologetic, deeply creepy’ Nilsen through home videos, the actor admits: ‘I suppose one becomes slightly obsessive. In the run‑up to filming, she’d had enough.’</p>

<p>Jobcentre worker Nilsen murdered at least 12 men and boys in London between 1978 and 1983.</p>

<p>‘The research phase is immersive,’ adds Tennant, 49, who has five children with actress Georgia, 35, daughter of former Doctor Who star Peter Davison.</p>

<p>‘I could listen to him, watch him, and there is an element that helps you to unlock who that person is — the way they talk and move and present themselves, their body language.’</p>

<p>How about choosing a comedy next, David?</p>
