        <p>Tottenham star Eric Dier is determined not to be 'pigeonholed' as a footballer after releasing a new restaurant app. </p>

<p>The former Sporting Lisbon man is sinking his teeth into a new platform called Spotlas, which promises to transform the dining experience, and says he's fed up of the idea players should 'stick to football'. </p>

<p>Born in England and raised in Portugal, Dier has grown up with a passion for food and culture, but many will be surprised he is delving into the world of business at the age of just 26. </p>

<p>Tottenham's Eric Dier has moved into the business world with new restaurant app Spotlas </p>

<p>The defender hopes to help the struggling dining business with his map-based network</p>

<p>He insists footballers have plenty of time to kill after the balls are rounded up in training and wants to make the most of it by showing he has much more to offer outside the game. </p>

<p>'From a football point of view, we have a lot of spare time,' he tells Sportsmail. </p>

<p>'It's a conversation that exists a lot. "You need to concentrate on football". This is something that really annoys me because I feel people constantly want to pigeonhole footballers.</p>

<p>'If we try to do something with our spare time and try to be creative you get criticised. If you go home and play Playstation for eight hours you get criticised! So it's a situation you can't win. </p>

<p>'Football will always be my main focus. It's very easy because I love it so much. We train in the morning and we have a lot of free time in the afternoon. It was about taking advantage of that.' </p>

<p>Dier feels players are 'pigeonholed' and is keen to show he has more to offer outside the game </p>

<p>Spotlas, which launched last week, is a new map-based restaurant recommendation platform that aims to be a cross between Instagram and TripAdvisor. </p>

<p>Co-founded alongside his brother Patrick and friend Zoe, it allows users to see reviews from their friends, celebrities and influencers, as well as posting their own. </p>

<p>Dier sees it as an opportunity to 'digitise word of mouth' and deliver a service that could boost a struggling restaurant market - while also satisfying 'foodies' like him. </p>

<p>'Growing up in Portugal, that helped me a lot to appreciate different types of food, so I've always enjoyed that side,' he continued. 'I was finding new places but I didn't have the platform to help me do that.' </p>

<p>Like a manager with too many good players, there will always be that blessing that doubles as a dilemma. What if this venture blows up and interferes with his playing career?</p>

<p>He said footballers have plenty of spare time on their hands after they finish with training</p>

<p>'So far it really hasn't been a problem at all. I try to be as involved as I can be in it, within what football allows me, but in terms of time management it hasn't been too difficult so far.</p>

<p>'If it achieves what we hope then it could be difficult! For now we're managing it well, 'Patrick and Zoe are on it 24/7. I just manage around my football schedule and I think we've got a good balance.' </p>

<p>Another bonus for Dier is being able to work alongside his brother, who he shares a close relationship with. </p>

<p>Business and pleasure shouldn't always be mixed together, but Dier insists they have a good system. 'We treat it like a working relationship which is the key, at times you can't help but speak about it at home.</p>

<p>'We have our meetings at the office - when we're in that environment it's very business-like. We try to keep things separate and it's been healthy so far. If I was to ever work with someone I'd much rather it would be one of my brothers.'</p>

<p>A number of Tottenham stars have downloaded the app - including Dier's close friend Dele Alli (right), who is after shares in the business</p>

<p>For the Dier brothers and Zoe, Spotlas had a rocky beginning. The trio were ready to launch earlier in March – then they were forced to shelve their plans as restaurants up and down the country shut up shop. But instead it provided an opportunity to go back to the drawing board. </p>

<p>'It was difficult for us because we had prepared to launch just before we went into lockdown,' he added. 'So I think it was a positive thing because it gave us time to implement some features that weren't originally in it for launch.'</p>

<p>As they tested the product during lockdown, Dier had a helping hand from his current and former Tottenham teammates, who got the ball rolling by signing up. In theory - you should be able to see where all the Spurs stars love to dine out.</p>

<p>Jan Vertonghen, Ben Davies, Michel Vorm and Mousa Dembele have all created accounts, as well as close friend Dele Alli – who is keen to get a bit more involved in the business.</p>

<p>'Dele's tried to negotiate already on some things,' Dier said. 'He wanted some shares, but he's not getting any for now!'</p>

<p>Starting any business is tough work, but Dier savours the lessons he's learned from his time in football. Playing at Lisbon and Tottenham has meant he has been surrounded by diversity and values the lessons he's been taught by coaches and players. He plans to take those lessons into his business journey.</p>

<p>'One thing football has given me in general - the greatest gift it's given me – I've been lucky enough to learn many languages, be around many different cultures, learning different things from all of them.</p>

<p>Dier believes his cultural upbringing is the 'greatest gift' his football career has given him </p>

<p>'The Argentinian players at Tottenham pretty much taught me Spanish! These are the sort of things football gives you that people take for granted. They already help me in anything I do in life.'</p>

<p>So having developed a clear passion outside of the game, is this what Eric Dier is leaning towards once he's hung up his boots? He tells me he's already got an idea for another app in the pipeline but ultimately just wants to be kept busy – and hasn't ruled out turning to coaching either.</p>

<p>'With Spotlas I've really enjoyed the experience so far and I'm excited to see where it goes,' he added. 'In the future there might be more opportunities for different things. We have another app we want to do so we'll be looking to build that soon.</p>

<p>'I think you see the problem that footballers have when they retire, the difficulties they have. It's something I think about because it's not a place I want to be in when I retire.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old has his best years ahead of him but admits he has considered life after football</p>

<p>He said the Tottenham squad are excited to have 'a clean slate' going into the new campaign </p>

<p>'I'm still quite young, so it will be a case of seeing what happens in the future and management is something definitely that interests me more and more.'</p>

<p>Last week saw the release of the 2020-21 Premier League fixtures with just weeks until the new campaign begins. It's been a whirlwind ride for Dier, who's entering strange territory having only just recently wrapped up the last season.</p>

<p>Spurs start with Everton at home on September 12 – but Dier insists he's not interested who they play. After a poor 2019-20, he says the only thing the squad have on their minds is putting things right under Jose Mourinho. </p>

<p>'You've got to play everyone twice,' he says. 'I'm the kind of person – if you ask me who we're playing in three games time I couldn't tell you. I just focus on the next one and then once I'm past that I change to the one after. I enjoy that way of thinking.</p>

<p>He has nailed down a place in Jose Mourinho's team as he looks to transition back to defence</p>

<p>'Everyone's really excited – just to have a clean slate with the manager. It's really nice that we've got zero matches played, zero points, we start every competition from scratch. That's a really nice place to be and we're really excited because the way we finished last season - I felt we were starting to make some big strides and hopefully we can continue that.'</p>

<p>Last season was a case of 'all's well that ends well' for Dier. He made just 15 starts in the Premier League but five of those came in the restart under Mourinho alongside Toby Alderweireld. And after the season ended he signed a new deal until 2024.</p>

<p>The reinvigorated player says he feels like he's 20 again – vowing to help Spurs end their trophy drought and become 'the best in my position'. It's a topic that has raised some debate among supporters – what is his best position? </p>

<p>He was transformed into a holding midfielder by Mauricio Pochettino and many expected Dier to act as Mourinho's anchor man, but now the player himself has set the record straight.</p>

<p>Dier signed a new contract with the club last month and wants to be the best in his position</p>

<p>'Centre-back. And I think that was a huge part of me signing a new contract,' he said. 'If you spoke to the chairman [Daniel Levy] he'd always say my decisions are always based on football and that was really what made me want to stay at Tottenham.</p>

<p>'The manager gave me the chance to return to my favourite position. It was something I wanted for quite a long time, it was something that was spoken about for a long time and I feel I've taken the chance so far. </p>

<p>'At the same time I feel I can do a lot better. It's the position I feel I can fulfil my potential to the highest and I want to be one of the best in it.'</p>
