    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>The BBC's new director-general Tim Davie has warned staff need to 'represent every part of this country' as he today arrived for his first day at work amid reports he plans to axe the broadcaster's 'left-wing comedies'.</p>

<p>Wearing a blazer, a shirt and jeans, Mr Davie today arrived at the broadcaster's offices in Scotland, where he today told staff the BBC needs to keep reforming 'with urgency' and stressed it must be 'a universal public service'.</p>

<p>Mr Davie, the former chief executive of BBC Studios, the corporation's commercial production and distribution arm, is expected to set out his plans for the broadcaster in the coming week, with impartiality a key focus.</p>

<p>He reportedly wants a radical overhaul of the broadcaster's comedy output in the coming months, over fears it is seen as is seen as 'too one-sided', reports The Telegraph.</p>

<p>Shows such as BBC Two's satirical comedy The Mash Report and The Now Show on Radio 4 and Have I Got News For You have previously been criticised.</p>

<p>BBC's new director-general Tim Davie today arrived at work for his first day in his new role, as reports suggest he will make a radical shake-up of the broadcaster's 'left-wing biased comedies', while top executives look at a new model of funding</p>

<p>Mr Davie reportedly wants a radical overhaul of the broadcaster's comedy output in the coming months, over fears it is seen as is seen as 'too one-sided', reports the Telegraph</p>

<p>BBC broadcaster Andrew Neil in 2018 described the former as a 'self satisfied, self adulatory, unchallenged Left-wing propaganda,' while he hit out at as Now Show on Radio 4 was 'contrived ideological commentary'.</p>

<p>Last year, BBC bosses said comedian Jo Brand had gone 'too far' when she made a joke on Radio Four's comedy show Heresy about throwing battery acid over 'unpleasant' politicians.</p>

<p>Tim Davie was born in 1967 and was educated at Whitgift School in Croydon, south London, before going on to study English at Cambridge University.</p>

<p>He has a background in the private sector and prior to joining the BBC in 2005 he served as the vice president for marketing and franchise for drinks giant PepsiCo Europe.</p>

<p>When he joined the broadcaster he became director of its marketing, communications and audiences division in 2005.</p>

<p>He subsequently became director of the BBC's audio and music division in 2008, assuming responsibility for its national radio stations including Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>

<p>In the same year that he took on the role, Davie had to address controversy surrounding a prank call made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross to actor Andrew Sachs on Radio 2.</p>

<p>Brand quit the station after the broadcast of the pre-recorded prank, in which he left an obscene message on Sachs's voicemail.</p>

<p>Davie also decided to axe the 6 Music radio station in 2010, a decision which was later reversed.</p>

<p>In 2012 he became chief executive of BBC Worldwide, a commercial arm of the broadcaster.</p>

<p>In November of that year he then stepped in to become acting director-general after George Entwistle left the corporation in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.</p>

<p>He served in the post until Lord Tony Hall took over in April 2013.</p>

<p>After Lord Hall became director-general, Davie returned to BBC Worldwide and oversaw a merger with BBC Studios in 2018 and later became CEO of the production arm.</p>

<p>She branded the throwing of milkshakes on politicians such as Nigel Farage as 'pathetic' and added: 'Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?'</p>

<p>She added: 'I'm not going to do it, it's purely a fantasy. But I think milkshakes are pathetic.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, top BBC executives will also look at replacing the traditional licence fee system with a special income tax, according to reports in The Guardian today.</p>

<p>Such a system is currently used in Sweden to fund all of its public service broadcasting. </p>

<p>People paid a maximum of £113 (1,300 SeK) 2019 for the service, compared to the £157-a-year for the BBC, while the tax is a sliding scale with those with less money paying less - unlike the BBC's flat rate system. </p>

<p>Mr Davie starts his new role today, taking over from Lord Tony Hall as the BBC's director-general.</p>

<p>In a message sent to all staff, he said it was a 'tremendous honour' to take on the role and confirmed he will be laying out priorities for the future on Thursday.</p>

<p>He added: 'Overall my guiding principle is that we are a universal public service, a BBC for all, that serves and represents every part of this country</p>

<p>'Our focus must be to ensure that we deliver outstanding and unique value to all audiences, those who pay for us and are in effect our customers, in return for their licence fee.</p>

<p>'To do this we will need to keep reforming the BBC with urgency so that we are trusted, relevant and indispensable in this digital age.</p>

<p>'While we do face challenges, the senior team and I are incredibly proud to be leading this organisation and supporting you.</p>

<p>'We are an organisation that matters, and your work is admired for its creative brilliance, outstanding journalism and much more across the world.</p>

<p>'I am here to ensure that continues.'</p>

<p>Lord Hall's exit after seven years in the role comes amid a turbulent time for the BBC.</p>

<p>The broadcaster faces scrutiny over equal pay, diversity, free TV licences for the over-75s and competition from streaming services such as Netflix, as well as the on-going coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>Davie was acting director-general for four months following George Entwistle's resignation in November 2012 before Lord Hall's appointment, and previously served as the corporation's head of audio.</p>

<p>Lord Hall's exit after seven years in the role comes amid a turbulent time for the BBC</p>

<p>Before joining the BBC in 2005, he worked in marketing.</p>

<p>Davie starts as the BBC hit controversy over the decision to play orchestral versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory at the Last Night Of The Proms.</p>

<p>The BBC is also expecting to receive a report into the use of social media by its staff, including presenters, written by Richard Sambrook.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr Davie will look at options for alternative funding for the BBC.</p>

<p>The BBC's current licence fee model is guaranteed until 2027 under a royal charter.</p>

<p>But speculation is growing that Mr Davie could opt to change the funding model earlier for a new long-term option, reports The Guardian. </p>

<p>The Swedish-style income tax model is one option, while Mr Davie's predecessor Lord Hall has previously mentioned an option which would see the fee added to council tax bills.</p>

<p>It comes as The Mail on Sunday revealed how a former Downing Street adviser is behind a secret new project to set up an ‘impartial’ television news channel to rival the crisis-hit BBC.</p>

<p>Sir Robbie Gibb – who was a senior BBC executive before becoming Theresa May’s director of communications at No 10 – is spearheading a drive to raise funds for GB News.</p>

<p>The 24-hour station, due to launch early next year, aims to capitalise on growing discontent over the BBC, with sources describing it as an antidote to the ‘woke, wet’ Corporation.</p>

<p>Sir Robbie’s channel will use standard digital platforms such as Freeview, and has already been given a licence by broadcasting regulator Ofcom. </p>

<p>Pressure on the BBC will further increase with the development of a second rival news channel from Rupert Murdoch’s News UK company, likely to be streamed online in a similar way to Netflix. </p>

<p>Sir Robbie’s venture comes amid growing tensions between No 10 and the BBC, with Downing Street saying the Corporation speaks only to a ‘pro-Remain metropolitan bubble’ and Boris Johnson accusing the BBC of ‘cringing embarrassment about our history’.</p>

<p>The Government periodically boycotts flagship news programmes such as Radio 4’s Today, while Downing Street is also considering accelerating its plans to decriminalise non-payment of the £157.50-a-year licence fee.</p>

<p>It comes after the BBC faced a series of controversies over what’s seen as its politically correct agenda, culminating in public outrage over its decision last week to perform Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia without their patriotic lyrics at the Last Night Of The Proms.  </p>

<p>On Friday, Lord Hall insisted the BBC was not a ‘woke corporation’.</p>

<p>He said the lyrics had been dropped from the patriotic songs at Last Night Of The Proms because it would not be possible to do them justice without an audience at the Royal Albert Hall.</p>

<p>Lord Hall added that he and Mr Davie had jointly approved the move to play orchestral versions, which he insisted was ‘the right creative decision’.</p>

<p>However, Mr Davie is reportedly considering changing the decision, and is understood to believe his predecessor Lord Hall's move wreaked 'terrible damage' to the BBC, insiders have told The Sun.</p>

<p>An insider told the paper: 'Tim's immediate priority will be to undo the terrible damage done by Tony.</p>

<p>'Tim has a chance to do a big, crowd-pleasing U-turn on a policy that is wildly unpopular.</p>

<p>'Tim has already insisted on an announcement making clear that Rule Britannia will be sung at next year's Proms.'</p>

<p>The 1902 lyrics of Land of Hope and Glory are associated with Cecil Rhodes – the British imperialist whose statue is being removed from an Oxford college.</p>

<p>Two thirds of voters in an exclusive Daily Mail poll wanted the £157.50 television charge scrapped and 59 per cent believed the BBC was wrong over the Rule Britannia singing row</p>

<p>The decision to use instrumental versions of the patriotic anthems for the summer festival has drawn widespread anger - with staff at the corporation also venting their frustration at bosses' apparent submission to 'woke' activists who find the anthems offensive.</p>

<p>One senior insider said: 'This is another example of the BBC walking into a completely unnecessary and absurd row about culture.</p>

<p>'It makes a lot of us despair when this kind of thing happens again and again.</p>

<p>'There's lots of things you can say about both of the songs and they are not up to the minute. But that's the case with 99 per cent of our culture one way or the other.'</p>

<p>And ex-BBC chairman Michael Grade launched a blistering attack on the corporation, calling the decision 'idiotic' and a 'ghastly mistake' by bosses who have 'lost touch' with the British public.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week opposed the BBC's decision.</p>

<p>He said: 'I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history.'</p>

<p>Some of the BBC's top comedy shows have faced criticism in recent years over perceived left-wing bias, while BBC comedians have also faced criticism over political comments and jokes.</p>

<p>Last year, comedian Jo Brand made a joke on BBC Radio Four's comedy show Heresy about throwing battery acid over 'unpleasant' politicians.</p>

<p>She branded the throwing of milkshakes on politicians such as Nigel Farage as 'pathetic' and added: 'Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?'</p>

<p>Comedian Jo Brand apologised after she made a joke on BBC Radio Four's comedy show Heresy about throwing battery acid over 'unpleasant' politicians </p>

<p>She added: 'I'm not going to do it, it's purely a fantasy. But I think milkshakes are pathetic.' </p>

<p>Her quip, in June last year, was initially defended by the BBC, who later backtracked and admitted Ms Brand had 'gone too far' - while the 63-year-old also apologised.</p>

<p>Regulator Ofcom earlier this year said the star's comments had the 'potential to offend listeners', but it was unlikely to encourage or incite the commission of a crime.</p>

<p>Last year, The BBC pulled an episode of its long-running satirical show Have I Got News For You just minutes before it was due to air over fears it would breach election impartiality rules by having Change UK leader Heidi Allen as a guest.</p>

<p>The programme was removed from the evening schedule because Heidi Allen, of Change UK/The Independent Group, was on the show.</p>

<p>Have I Got News For You, which features Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, has previously faced criticism by viewers claiming an anti-Conservative and anti-Brexit bias</p>

<p>BBC editorial guidelines around election periods do not allow programmes where 'equal representation' is not achieved.</p>

<p>Ms Allen took to Twitter to air her frustration, while Change UK wrote to the BBC following the decision, which came after Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage had been a panellist on political debate show BBC Question Time days earlier.</p>

<p>The long-running panel show, produced by Hat Trick productions for the BBC, has previously faced criticism by viewers claiming an anti-Conservative and anti-Brexit bias.</p>

<p>It received complaints earlier this year over a discussion on top Conservative aide Dominic Cummings' trip from London to Durham in lockdown.</p>

<p>The BBC dismissed the complaints, arguing the story did not receive 'disproportionate' coverage.</p>

<p>BBC Two's The Mash Report has also faced criticism, with satirical pieces poking fun at Brexit and the Conservatives.</p>

<p>BBC Two's The Mash Report, pictured: host Nish Kumar, has also faced criticism, with satirical pieces poking fun at Brexit and the Conservatives</p>

<p>Panel show Mock the Week has also been criticised in the past over perceived anti-Conservative and anti-Brexit bias</p>

<p>In one piece, about the government's Brexit advertising plan, headed up by Michael Gove, comedian Rachel Parris said: 'He's a good man,' prompting host Nish Kumar to respond 'Is he?'</p>

<p>The comedian then responds: 'No,' prompting laughter from the audience.</p>

<p>The BBC also provoked outrage earlier this year by screening an 'anti-British' children's programme on Brexit Day.</p>

<p>Hosted by The Mash Report's Mr Kumar, Horrible Histories Brexit suggested Britain had historically failed to produce anything of note, relying instead on imports.</p>

<p>Horrible Histories Brexit suggested Britain had historically failed to produce anything of note, relying instead on imports</p>

<p>Other comedians such as Russell Howard have also sparked claims of political bias, while last year he spoke to music magazine NME where he described politicians, including Nigel Farage, as 'right-wing f**k-knuckles</p>

<p>Amid a chorus of protest, even one of the BBC's broadcasters launched a stinging attack on the show. </p>

<p>Andrew Neil called it 'anti-British drivel of a high order' and asked: 'Was any of the licence fee used to produce something purely designed to demean us?'</p>

<p>Mr Neil, a former editor of The Sunday Times and chairman of the group behind right-leaning magazine The Spectator, also hit out at the Mash Report as 'self satisfied, self adulatory, unchallenged Left-wing propaganda,' while describing the Now Show on Radio 4 as being 'contrived ideological commentary'. </p>
