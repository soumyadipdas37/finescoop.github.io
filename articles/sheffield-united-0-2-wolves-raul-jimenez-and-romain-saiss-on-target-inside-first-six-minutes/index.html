    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Wolves kickstarted the new Premier League campaign in stunning fashion after two goals in the first six minutes at Sheffield United handed them a winning start.</p>

<p>Raul Jimenez gave Nuno Espirito Santo's men the lead after just three minutes at Bramall Lane, clinically firing home from Daniel Podence's delivery following fine work from the winger down the left.</p>

<p>And it was soon two-nil. Pedro Neto's corner was met by a towering header from Romain Saiss, who was able to guide his effort beyond the helpless Aaron Ramsdale.</p>

<p>More to follow. </p>

<p>Wolves have begun the new Premier League season in style after easing past Sheffield United</p>

<p>Raul Jimenez (right) fired Wolves into the lead after just three minutes with a first-time strike</p>

<p>Romain Saiss arrived to meet Pedro Neto's corner and power a header beyond Aaron Ramsdale</p>

<p>Sheffield United: Ramsdale, Basham, Egan, O'Connell (McGoldrick 71), Baldock, Lundstram, Norwood (Berge 76), Fleck, Stevens, McBurnie, Sharp</p>

<p>Subs not used: Burke, Jagielka, Foderingham, Ampadu, Osborn</p>

<p>Bookings: Egan, McBurnie</p>

<p>Manager: Chris Wilder</p>

<p>Wolves: Patricio, Boly, Coady, Saiss, Traore, Dendoncker, Moutinho (Vitinho 86), Marcal, Podence (Neves 76), Jimenez, Neto (Buur 69)</p>

<p>Subs not used: Silva, Jota, Ruddy, Vinagre, Buur</p>

<p>Scorers: Jimenez 3, Saiss 6</p>

<p>Bookings: Marcal </p>

<p>Manager: Nuno Espirito Santo </p>

<p>Jimenez was picked out by Daniel Podence after his dash down the left and finished smartly</p>

<p>Sheffield United's players were left shell-shocked after conceding the first goal just minutes in</p>

<p>Chris Wilder cut a concerned figure on the touchline after his side quickly fell two goals behind</p>

<p>Oliver McBurnie steered a header over at the other end as the hosts pushed to half the deficit</p>

<p>McBurnie was booked shortly before the half-time whistled as frustrations continued to mount</p>

<p>Sheffield United pushed after the break to halve the deficit but couldn't find a way through</p>

<p>Recap all the action from Bramall Lane from Sportsmail's live blog with TOBY MILES.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>You'll be able to read our match report from Bramall Lane by refreshing this page in a few minutes' time.</p>

<p>But the Premier League action comes thick and fast as usual. My colleague Ieuan Ivett is poised to bring you live coverage of Brighton and Chelsea's clash this evening. </p>

<p>What a start for Wolves, with two goals from Raul Jimenez and Romain Saiss in the opening six minutes proving the difference. </p>

<p>Sheffield United will rue a dreadful first-half they never really got into, with poor marking their downfall. However, a much stronger second-half where they at least matched Wolves will give Blades fans hope for this season. </p>

<p>Wolves looked ominously assured - powerful in defence and ruthless in attack. A fearsome performance from Jimenez will have fans waiting impatiently for their next fixture. </p>

<p>McBurnie's header is cleared off the line by Saiss, who has had a superb game. That really, really needed to go in. </p>

<p>Some small hope for Sheffield United as the official indicates five extra minutes. Looking unlikely now though, the pace has gone out of this game. </p>

<p>Vitinha is on for Joao Moutinho late-on as Wolves look to take control in midfield. </p>

<p>Sheffield United's hopes are fading fast here. The Blades need a goal right now.</p>

<p>Superb working from Adama Traore, beating two Sheffield players on the touchline, cutting inside and getting a shot away. His deflected effort earns Wolves a corner, which Jimenez flicks onto the outside of the post. </p>

<p>Traore has moved into a more attacking role after starting at right-wing-back, and it's suiting him much better. </p>

<p>Sheffield United send Sander Berge on for Oliver Norwood as they push for a goal that would light up this tie.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wolves have sent on Ruben Neves to control the pace with Daniel Podence being hauled off.</p>

<p>So close to game over for Sheffield, as Saiss find himself one-on-one with Blades debutant Aaron Ramsdale, who brilliantly pushes the ball onto the post, before Raul Jimenez shoots off-target on the rebound.</p>

<p>Blades living dangerously, before going up the other end and going close themselves.</p>

<p>David McGoldrick on for the hosts now too, replacing Chris Basham. </p>

<p>Pedro Neto is replaced by 22-year-old Oskar Buur Rasmussen after the winger's final bursting run over the halfway line. </p>

<p>Pedro Neto storms down the touchline before Chris Basham does well to cover the flying winger, but the Blades concede a free-kick which is cleared away well by McBurnie. </p>

<p>This game is starting to look as tight as we expected pre-match. </p>

<p>The sort of free-flowing football we didn't see once from Sheffield United in the first-half is finding its way into their play after the break. A classy move sees Billy Sharp fizz a ball across the face of Wolves' goal, but nobody could get there in time for a tap-in. </p>

<p>The Blades are on top now. </p>

<p>Centre-back Saiss almost grabs his second of the game with a free-header, powering the ball narrowly wide. Blades marking still hasn't improved. </p>

<p>Sheffield United are finally giving Wolves something to think about, as Fleck fires a shot off the post before George Baldock's low effort fizzes wide. </p>

<p>This is better. </p>

<p>Enda Stevens beats Adama Traore and finds space at a tight angle on the left but can't fire his shot goalwards, smacking it high and wide. </p>

<p>More of that needed from Wilder's men</p>

<p>Here we go for the second 45 minutes, Sheffield need to stamp some authority on this game pronto if they want to trouble Wolves, who have been rock-solid so far. </p>

<p>What a start to the season for Raul Jimenez, kicking-off his scoring tally after two minutes of the 2020-21 Premier League season. </p>

<p>The Mexican looks refreshed and in full confidence after his short summer break, having begun to look sluggish in the late stages of Wolves' exhausting 2019-20 season. </p>

<p>Jimenez scored 27 goals in all competitions last term and looks set to continue his scoring form this year. He's controlling this game and causing the Blades constant problems. </p>

<p>After a minute of added time it's Wolves in complete control at the break, with an ominous first 45 minutes of the season. </p>

<p>Sheffield United have cooled things down after the early chaos but just can't cause Wolves any problems.</p>

<p>They're not out of it, but there is much work to do. Big team talk coming up from Chris Wilder.</p>

<p>That was a perfect example of Wolves' defensive power today. Leander Dendoncker crowds out Fleck comfortably amid several attempts from Sheffield to break the visitors' line - each being easily repelled. </p>

<p>Chris Wilders' side are getting more possession now, but are yet to threaten with it</p>

<p>Oliver McBurnie goes into the book now too, and he's not happy. </p>

<p>The Blades are pushing hard but Wolves are repelling their attacks comfortably.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Jimenez is causing the Blades all kinds of problems, as John Egan goes into the referee's book for tripping the Mexican </p>

<p>Already lost count of Sheffield United's offsides, as Fleck is caught out by the Wolves defence once more. </p>

<p>Nuno Espirito Santo's side look a level above right now</p>

<p>Another disjointed, scrappy Sheffield attack ends with nothing after John Lundstram's ball in, as Rui Patricio is fouled and Wolves are handed a free-kick. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wolves run up the end with another counter, but Jimenez can't get the ball under control</p>

<p>Sheffield United are trying to get a feel of the ball here, settling the pace down after crowding-out another Jimenez chance. </p>

<p>Another hopeful United cross into the box is snuffed out by Wolves.</p>

<p>Raul Jiminez finds himself in space from 25-yards and tries to bend it into the far corner, but the Mexican forward blazes over. Wolves firmly in control. </p>

<p>Adama Traore tries to muscle forward on the right but is fouled. Moutinho stands over the free-kick which is whipped in from deep but the Blades head away assuredly.</p>

<p>Wolves look superb, a start like that will put fear into opponents later this season. Cool in possession and ready to pounce with searing pace.</p>

<p>Adama Traore even tries a bit of show-boating at right-wing-back... a little early for that Adama!</p>

<p>Wolves really were ready for the season weren't they! The visitors ruthless as Raul Jimenez gets another chance before winning a corner, which is played out-swinging for Romain Saiss to power in after peeling away from his marker.</p>

<p>Wolves. Mean. Business. </p>

<p>Already! Wolves get the perfect start as Raul Jiminez fires side-footed into the top corner completely unmarked in the Blades penalty area.</p>

<p>The Blades will be furious as Daniel Podence found space to cross into the striker in a swift counter-attack move. </p>

<p>We're underway at Bramall Lane after all the players took the knee. </p>

<p>Sheffield United in their familiar red and white home strip, Wolves also lining-up in their orange and black home kit. </p>

<p>The players emerge from the tunnel on this sunny evening at Bramall Lane to the tune of Kanye West and Rihanna's 'All of the Lights'.</p>

<p>No fans in attendance against as these sides seasons kick-off, but it should be a fascinating game. </p>

<p>Here we go, just five minutes until kick-off at Bramall Lane. </p>

<p>Last season's seventh-place against ninth, should be a tight contest.  </p>

<p>Wolves have the tough task of facing a resilient Sheffield United in their season opener with Nuno Espirito Santo’s side tight favourites at 6/4 to come away with a win, according bookmaker unikrn.</p>

<p>Chris Wilder’s team boasted the second-best home defence in the league last season and are 9/4 to claim victory at Bramall Lane tonight.</p>

<p>Few goals are expected with Wolves also possessing one of the best defensive records on the road last season with under 2.5 goals in tonight’s game priced at 2/5.</p>

<p>Blades defender John Egan made the difference in this fixture last year, scoring in the 90th minute to claim a 1-0 victory and is a 12/1 shot to score anytime tonight.</p>

<p>Wolves come into their Premier League opener secure in the knowledge that their highly-rated boss is fully committed to the cause this season.</p>

<p>The Portuguese boss has signed a three-year deal with a major pay-rise, perfect timing as Wolves aim to continue their rapid rise.</p>

<p>Aaron Ramsdale makes his Sheffield United debut tonight after the keeper joined the Blades from Bournemouth this summer.</p>

<p>Last season, Manchester United loanee Dean Henderson was one of the stars of Chris Wilder's overachieving side, but is set to stay at Old Trafford this term. </p>

<p>Can Ramsdale fill Henderson's gloves? Wilder certainly thinks so...</p>

<p>Here's how Wolves line-up for tonight's 2020/21 @premierleague opener against @SheffieldUnited. #SHUWOL📋🐺 pic.twitter.com/ubjOxbqmpb</p>

<p>Here's how United line-up. 👊Jack O'Connell starts despite missing all the pre-season friendlies, whilst David McGoldrick and Sander Berge are fit enough to be included in 18. pic.twitter.com/LglUIiDN0g</p>

<p>Good evening and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of Wolves' trip to Bramall Lane for a clash with Sheffield United!</p>

<p>With both clubs getting their Premier League campaigns underway tonight, Nuno Espirito Santo and Chris Wilder will be keen to build on last season's top-half finishes by getting underway victory...</p>
