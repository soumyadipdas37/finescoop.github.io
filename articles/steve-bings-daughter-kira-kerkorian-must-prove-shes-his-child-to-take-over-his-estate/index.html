        <p>Steve Bing's daughter Kira Kerkorian has to prove she's his child to take over the late multi-millionaire's estate after he disinherited her and son Damian Hurley in his will, according to court papers obtained by DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Bing committed suicide aged 55 in June, jumping from his 27th floor apartment in Los Angeles - days before the year anniversary of his 28-year-old girlfriend's death.  </p>

<p>The Hollywood movie investor, who received a $600 million inheritance from his grandfather when he turned 18, had a will drawn up in 2001 that disinherited any children he may have had.  </p>

<p>Bing was sensationally revealed as Kira's biological father in a legal dispute between tennis pro Lisa Bonder and her ex-husband, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, who was led to believe Kira was his daughter. </p>

<p>A private investigator dug dental floss out of Bing's trash to get a DNA sample for the paternity test, Bing claimed.</p>

<p>Last month, Kira filed papers seeking to be made the administrator of her late father's estate, which was valued at just $337,000.</p>

<p>Now the court wants Kira to prove she's Bing's biological daughter in order to be made administrator, in addition to wanting his trust's beneficiary - The Clinton Foundation - to nominate her. </p>

<p>Steve Bing's daughter Kira Kerkorian has to prove she's his child to take over the late multi-millionaire's estate after he disinherited her and son Damian Hurley in his will, according to court papers obtained by DailyMail.com. Pictured: Bing with Kira and her mother Lisa Bonder </p>

<p>Bing was sensationally revealed as Kira's father in a legal dispute between tennis pro Lisa Bonder and her ex-husband, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian (pictured together), who was led to believe Kira was his daughter. A private investigator dug dental floss out of Bing's trash to get a DNA sample for the paternity test</p>

<p>Now the court wants Kira to prove she's Bing's biological daughter in order to be made administrator, in addition to wanting his trust's beneficiary - The Clinton Foundation - to nominate her. Bing, who established his trust in 1983, had long been a friend of the Clintons</p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation is listed as Bing's trust beneficiary </p>

<p>Bing, who established his trust in 1983, had long been a friend of the Clintons and was pictured with Bill throughout the years. </p>

<p>Upon news of his death, Bill Clinton tweeted: 'I loved Steve Bing very much. He had a big heart, and he was willing to do anything he could for the people and causes he believed in. </p>

<p>'I will miss him and his enthusiasm more than I can say, and I hope he’s finally found peace.'  </p>

<p>Despite excluding Kira and his son Damian Hurley with British actress Elizabeth Hurley from his will, Bing later formed relationships with both Damian and Kira, even fighting for them to be included in their grandfather's trust last year. </p>

<p>Prior to his death, Bing had an estimated net worth of $590 million, according to various reports. </p>

<p>While his estate was valued at just $337,000 - his properties were not included in that evaluation. </p>

<p>At the time of his death, Bing was fighting a $7 million breach of contract lawsuit against entrepreneur Matthew Khoury's company KRE Wellness, stemming from an agreement made in 2015. </p>

<p>Khoury claims that between Fall 2015 and Summer 2019, Bing failed to pay 'qualifying receipts', and filed suit against Bing in April.  </p>

<p>The Hollywood movie investor, who received a $600 million inheritance from his grandfather when he turned 18, had a will drawn up in 2001 that disinherited any children he may have had </p>

<p>Steve Bing disinherited his two children Damian Hurley (pictured with mother Elizabeth Hurley) and Kira Kerkorian from his will, as Kerkorian fights for control of his estate that was valued at just $337,000, according to documents obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com</p>

<p>Kira says in court documents that she wants to be made Special Administrator for Bing's estate so she can fight the suit. </p>

<p>Bing died on June 22, just days before the one-year anniversary of his girlfriend 28-year-old actress Allexanne Mitchum's death from a drug overdose, social media posts by her family revealed.</p>

<p>The multi-millionaire committed suicide aged 55 in June, jumping from his 27th floor apartment in Los Angeles - days before the year anniversary of his 28-year-old girlfriend's death </p>

<p>The couple had an argument, but Bing called and the two made up. </p>

<p>However, before she returned to their Palm Springs home she took what she believed to be a Xanax pill. </p>

<p>The pill was laced with fentanyl causing Allexanne to overdose. </p>

<p>She stopped breathing that day and was declared dead on July 3, 2019.</p>

<p>Allexanne's aunt said that even before the coronavirus lockdown Bing was struggling with his mental health, feeling guilty over Allexanne's death.</p>

<p>'In March, shortly before lockdown, Steve, my mother, and I were to meet for lunch at The Bel Air. Steve called that morning and asked that just I come as he was not feeling well,' her aunt Carrie wrote on Facebook. </p>

<p>'I went to his apartment in Century City, bought him a bunch of groceries, and we talked for hours. He was questioning God, the afterlife, the meaning of everything and anything.</p>

<p>'He got really quiet and his eyes filled with tears and he said… 'And the guilt…'… I knew exactly what he meant.'</p>

<p>Bing reportedly wanted to have kids with Allexanne, as her aunt said in a post on Facebook: 'Steve had two children and while he fought for them, they were unplanned. </p>

<p>'Steve didn’t want to be a bad father, as he claimed his father was, so I was surprised he wanted to be a father but he told me Allexanne was afraid of being left alone if he died, since he was 25 years her senior.’  </p>

<p>Bing died on June 22, just days before the one-year anniversary of his girlfriend 28-year-old actress Allexanne Mitchum's (pictured together) death from a drug overdose, social media posts by her family revealed </p>

<p>Last year, Bing's father Peter Bing had tried to block Kira and Damian from being beneficiaries of his trust, claiming they were love children and should be excluded. </p>

<p>Bing jumped into the legal battle for his children and successfully fought the case, ensuring Damian and Kira would be beneficiaries.   </p>

<p>In a tribute posted on Instagram about Bing's death, Hurley revealed that she had been rebuilding her friendship with Bing over the past year.</p>

<p>'I am saddened beyond belief that my ex Steve is no longer with us. It is a terrible end,' Hurley wrote. </p>

<p>'Our time together was happy and I'm posting these pictures because although we went through some tough times, it's the good, wonderful memories of a sweet, kind man that matter.</p>

<p>'In the past year we had become close again. We last spoke on our son's 18th birthday. This is devastating news and I thank everyone for their lovely messages.'</p>
