        <p>It's usually a case of three times being a charm, but not in the case of comedian Lee Mack.</p>

<p>Deja Vu must have descended upon the funny man, as for the third year in a row he stepped up to the penalty spot with pressure hanging from his shoulders... only to miss once more.</p>

<p>The penalty shootout had been brought about by a 1-1 final score, following a game in which both sides had plenty of fun, but ultimately lacked bite when it really mattered. </p>

<p>A penalty shootout victory has once again see the Rest of the World team win at Soccer Aid</p>

<p>It was officially game over after Chunkz stepped up and slotted his penalty attempt wide</p>

<p>Prior to kick-off players took the knee to support the Black Lives Matter movement</p>

<p>Patrice Evra was back at Old Trafford and put in a lung-bursting performance for his side</p>

<p>Comedian John Bishop playing for England, seen tackling football freestyler Jeremy Lynch</p>

<p>Paddy McGuinness played in the match, sporting a crop of bleached blond hair</p>

<p>Musician Chunkz also stepped up to miss the target, as another year passed by in the annual charity bash where an England team failed to get their name on the trophy. </p>

<p>There was no crowd present at Old Trafford but, in the end, it was probably a good job as the goals were shy on arrival.</p>

<p>A tepid first half saw both sides equipped with a former professional goalkeeper, with David James in goal for England and Shay Given prowling the line for the Rest of the World.</p>

<p>Doing what they do best, both ex-Premier League stars provided a complete shut-out, seeing the Theatre of Dreams empty of both supporters and goalmouth action.</p>

<p>It took until the second period for the net to finally bulge, the Rest of the World taking the lead courtesy of former Tottenham and Liverpool man Robbie Keane.</p>

<p>Swift link-up with freestyle Jeremy Lynch saw the Irishman dink the ball over Alfie Allen - better known as Theon Greyjoy in Games of Thrones - in the England net.</p>

<p>Celebrations echoed around the famous stadium, only for England to be rapidly kicked into action.</p>

<p>As managerial duo Sam Allardyce and Wayne Rooney barked from the sidelines, the Three Lions only took a matter of minutes before music artist Yung Filly leveled the scoreline and reveled in the moment. </p>

<p>Scroll below to read up on how the action unfolded live with Sportsmail's DAN RIPLEY </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>It was he that saved Lee Mack's penalty to bring the ROTW back into the penalty shootout, and he was mobbed as soon as the delayed celebrations began following the win at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>Chunkz missing was the key moment but it took the ROTW XI a good 10-20 seconds to realise they had won it. Once the realisation had crept in though the celebrations soon started. No such thing as a friendly...</p>

<p>MISS!Chunkz misses the crucial penaltyEngland 3-4 World XIThe Soccer Aid World XI have retained their title!#ITVFootball #SoccerAid pic.twitter.com/EAEimfsTih</p>

<p>Just when you thought you were going to lose out on a summer staple of English football (yes, it is still summer for another couple of weeks yet!)</p>

<p>It was looking good for England when Locksmith fired a central shot onto the crossbar and over, but Lee Mack saw a poor bottom corner penalty saved by Oduba before Chunkz's efforts to find the top corner saw him send the ball halfway down the road to the Etihad Stadium instead.</p>

<p>ROTW XI win 4-3 on penalties</p>

<p>Chunkz misses</p>

<p>Kem Cetinay scores</p>

<p>James Bay scores</p>

<p>Dermot Kennedy scores</p>

<p>Lee Mack has shot saved</p>

<p>Serge Pizzorno scores</p>

<p>Mark Wright scores</p>

<p>Locksmith hits the crossbar</p>

<p>Olly Murs scores</p>

<p>Jeremy Lynch scores</p>

<p>Only celebrities are allowed to take penalties and it will be the celebrity keepers in goal. Rest of the World will take the first kick...</p>

<p>Penalty shootout to be contested</p>

<p>89min: Last chance to win it? Keane bursts through on the left but near the byline his pass into the six-yard box just evades Jeremy Lynch.</p>

<p>86min: England on top now as Andy Cole heads wide from a cross. We are heading towards a penalty shootout if this stays level for another four minutes. No extra-time this evening.</p>

<p>83min: So much for that experiment, Heskey makes way for Olly Murs. Meanwhile, Clive Tyldesley interviews the ROTW keeper Oduba during the game. Think we should be seing more of that in the professional game in all honesty...maybe.</p>

<p>80min: And on comes Andy Cole to partner Heskey in attack. Did they ever link up at international level? 20 years on we find out if the likes of Kevin Keegan and Sven Goran Eriksson made a massive mistake if they didn't as England managers around that time.</p>

<p>77min: Some rare dominance in this game from England as they win a series of corners. Joe Cole's deliveries cause trouble, with one of them resulting in the ball bouncing off the post</p>

<p>74min: I seem to have missed that England also have Ashley Cole on the pitch along with his namesake and former Chelsea team-mate Joe.</p>

<p>To make things even more confusing, with England needing a goal to win they still have Andy Cole on the bench as an option too. Three Cole's on the pitch is all we need!</p>

<p>71min: ROTW go close again as Darren Fletcher places an effort from 23 yards just wide of the top corner.</p>

<p>68min: England on the back foot following the restart, Robbie Keane continues to cause havoc for the ROTW.</p>

<p>65min: Time for drinks, and no surprise given the tempo at the start of this second half. John Terry is warned for a late foul, and perhaps forgetting it is a friendly gives referee Mark CLattenburg both barrels verbally.</p>

<p>62min: Rooney's half-time team-talk has done the job for England. They have looked much better in this second period. Emile Heskey even 20 years on from his peak can still hold the ball up extremely well.</p>

<p>59min: The game has opened up since Keane's strike. It's pretty much end-to-end now. Where was this in the first half?</p>

<p>56min: Here come the goals! Wayne Rooney throws on James Bay and his cross into the box is well controlled by Yung Filley who keeps his cool to slot home.</p>

<p>54min: It's been coming but to be fair to Alfie Allen not even David James would have saved this as Robbie Keane bends a lovely curling strike into the corner from the edge of the box.</p>

<p>I've heard Spurs still need a back-up to Harry Kane, are you watching Jose Mourinho?</p>

<p>GOAALLL!Keane picks up the ball on the edge and curls a delightful shot in off the postWatch LIVE📺 @ITV 📱 https://t.co/KcanItibsQ#ITVFootball #SoccerAid pic.twitter.com/ZqxX1SsIHQ</p>

<p>54min: England send on Katie Chapman for Wes Brown... as they had been cheating by not having a female player on the pitch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this might be England's first effort on goal as Mark Wright's rising effort is saved by Ore Oduba.</p>

<p>51min: Keane fancies his chances against Allen as the ROTW take the game to England. Keane sees a shot deflected wide for a corner.</p>

<p>47min: Bring back James? Game of Thrones star Alfie Allen  deals very nervously with a pass back that Keane just misses out on converting by poking out for a goal kick.</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney clearly not happy with his side, sending them out early. Harry Redknapp meanwhille has brought on Robbie Keane, Claude Makelele and Darren Fletcher.</p>

<p>Well the professional goalkeepers are off the pitch now and England have a couple more familiar faces coming on. Former internationals Joe Cole and Emile Heskey will feature for Wayne Rooney's side.</p>

<p>The former Tottenham boss is incharge of the ROTW, who have largely dominated this game.</p>

<p>The best player on the pitch so far has probably been Patrice Evra who has been effective in defence as well as attack.</p>

<p>John Terry and Gareth Barry a little bit ambitious, let's say, in trying to win the ball here...</p>

<p>The tackles are warming up 😳Gareth Barry with a very firm tackle on Jeremy Lynch Watch LIVE📺 @ITV 📱 https://t.co/ga9hp805yw#ITV #SoccerAid pic.twitter.com/VpdPVATzFb</p>

<p>42min: Kem Cetinay is also on for Kasabian guitarist Serge Pizzorno, having originally replaced Lianne Sanderson. Rules thought state there must be two women on the pitch for each team though so off goes Serge, who like Sanderson is wearing the No 7.</p>

<p>No I don't know either...</p>

<p>Essien meanwhile fires wide from distance.</p>

<p>39min: Changes again for England with Paddy McGuinness on for John Bishop while Chunkz needs a breather and departs for Lee Mack wearing the No 999 - as you do.</p>

<p>36min: Chance for John Terry! Maybe he has forgotten what a centre-back is these days as he drives through the centre of the pitch in run off the ball, but trying to connect with a cross he misses the ball completely inside the box.</p>

<p>33min: Sam Allardyce is down on the touchline helping out Rooney this evening. It's a shame we don't have Kevin Davies around to make the best use of Big Sam's management style.</p>

<p>30min: David James rolling back the years, and at 50-years-old that is no mean feat He dives down well to his let near post to keep out a Patrice Evra effort.</p>

<p>27min: Chunkz's friend Filly comes on for Danny Jones in England's second change. It shouldn't be possible but England look somehow even less threatening than the senior XI did last night.</p>

<p>24min: ROTW are starting to dominate now, with England just about clearing a set-piece having blocked two attempts on goal.</p>

<p>21min: Time for drinks, and during the period Rooney informs us alongside his assistant manager Bradley Walsh that Tom Davis picked up a knock before being substituted.</p>

<p>Having watched Mike Bassett; England Manager, I think Rooney could have picked a better assistant than 'Doddsy'.</p>

<p>18min: ROTW are coming into the game again. David James does well to collect a Lianne Sanderson effort, before Wes Brown shows his defensice prowess to force Jeremy Lynch into firing over the bar.</p>

<p>15min: He's not a put a foot wrong so far, it's likehe has never been away. Very rarely did he make a misstep while wearing the Three Lions.</p>

<p>12min: Rooney has already lost his patience with the big man up top!. Davis departs departs to e replaced by youtuber Chunkz.</p>

<p>There are talks that Davis has picked up a knock as England begin to take control of the game.</p>

<p>9min: Kelly Smith attempts to lead a break forward for England but soon runs into trouble with a lack of passing options. Tom Davis is leading the attacking role but has barely moved eight yards since the kickoff. Wayne Rooney is already starting to regret his team selection as subs are warming up.</p>

<p>6min: Not quite sold on Rooney's management style so far. ROTW are dominating possession early on and he barely looks concerned resting his chin on his arms perched up on the Old Trafford touchline wall.</p>

<p>3min: First shot on goal from the ROTW side and it comes from a free-kick given away by John Bishop but Michael Essien fires wide.</p>

<p>No fans still of course in the wake of the lockdown restrictions which have prevented football supporters from attending football games in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<p>Here is a reminder of the teams lining up in the first half:</p>

<p>Something he has done many times at Old Traddord over his career of course,</p>

<p>A legend returns 🙌🔴@ManUtd | @WayneRooney pic.twitter.com/6tuurySkjW</p>

<p>Because among the ranks for the rest of the world is former England international Lianne Sanderson. She represented England as recently as 2015 but her international career ended under a bit of a cloud owning to disagreements behind the scenes.</p>

<p>She was only at Juventus as recently as last season though so could have a big role to play against England this evening, and she is set to play in attack.</p>

<p>With a combined 211 caps, England also have Kelly Smith and Katie Chapman featuring in their line-up. They are likely to feature in the midfield so could be key for Rooney's side.</p>

<p>Mikael Silvestre and Patrice Evra know their way around the Theatre of Dreams and they are joined in the starting line-up by former Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien and ex Republic of Ireland keeper Shay Given.</p>

<p>Turns out not even the Derby player-coach knows, or at the very least he was keeping his cards close to his chest on his return to Old Trafford.</p>

<p>'It's great seeing former team-mates who you don't see that often. I'm not sure about my management style though,' he told ITV.</p>

<p>Luckily comedian John Bishop who also starts for England this evening filled us in a bit more in that detail, assuring us that he has put the fear among the players to win the game like the 'Godfather'.</p>

<p>And as if John Bishop would joke around...</p>

<p>David James, Wes Brown, John Terry, Gareth Barry.are among the stars taking part who certainly have seen a football in recent times.</p>

<p>Like Wayne Rooney, Wes Brown will be returning to Old Trafford as a former Manchester United star. Terry and Barry have only retired in recent years, but t will be interesting to see if David James can still show glimpses of his talent that had him as England's No 1 keeper 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Here is what can happen when you let players onto a pitch who don't have a background in professional football.</p>

<p>Over to you Boris Johnson and this 2006 classic of his attempt to challenge an opponent. Did the current British prime minister win the ball? You decide...</p>

<p>Nobody will top boris Johnson’s appearance on soccer aid #SoccerAid2018 pic.twitter.com/nJBmZTSimN</p>

<p>With Wayne Rooney of course still an active player for Derby County, they won't be too keen on him playing this game, so he will take charge of the England side alongside Sam Allardyce.</p>

<p>Here are teams for this evening's clash:</p>

<p>It's September, it's Old Trafford and we are about to see the likes of Wayne Rooney and John Terry and all featuring again inside the same ground.</p>

<p>Ok, it;s not quite going to be the same, but it should be a fun evening at the home of Manchester United as I welcome you to an England XI against the Rest of the World in Soccer Aid.</p>
