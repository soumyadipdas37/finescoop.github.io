        <p>More than 200 people were rescued by helicopters overnight into early Sunday after they got trapped by the raging Creek Fire near Mammoth Pool Reservoir northeast of Fresno, California.</p>

<p>The people got trapped at the reservoir at the Sierra National Forest as the rapid-spreading wildfire cut off the only escape route and they were advised to shelter in place, meaning jump into the water to avoid the flames.</p>

<p>On Sunday Blackhawk helicopters and at least one Chinook flew to rescue the people surrounded by the blaze and took them to the National Gard base at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport. </p>

<p>A total of 207 people were airlifted from the Mammoth Pool area to Fresno, Forest Service spokesman Daniel Tune said to KSEE.</p>

<p>At least 20 people were injured in the blaze, some of them critically. Two people stayed behind, refusing to be evacuated.</p>

<p>'There were several critical patients. Some with broken bones. Some with burns. Many with lacerations and abrasions,' Fresno County EMS Director Dan Lynch said.</p>

<p>The Creek fire has burned 45,500 acres and is zero percent contained, the U.S. Forest Service said on Sunday.  </p>

<p>More than 200 people were rescued by helicopters overnight into early Sunday after they got trapped by the raging Creek Fire near Mammoth Pool Reservoir northeast of Fresno, California. The rescue effort pictured above </p>

<p>On Sunday Blackhawk helicopters and at least one Chinook flew to rescue the people surrounded by the blaze and took them to the National Gard base at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport where they were medically assessed</p>

<p>At least 20 people were injured in the blaze, some of them critically. 'There were several critical patients. Some with broken bones. Some with burns. Many with lacerations and abrasions,' Fresno County EMS Director Dan Lynch said</p>

<p>General Daniel Hokanson of the 29th Chief of the National Guard Bureau praised the rescue effort as 'simply extraordinary' sharing a photo from inside one of the rescue helicopters on Sunday</p>

<p>A total of 800 personnel consisting of 25 engines, five hand crews, three dozers, two helicopters and three air tankers have responded to the blaze.</p>

<p>The National Guard along with the fire and law enforcement agencies from Fresno and Madera counties conducted the rescue operation.</p>

<p>'Simply extraordinary, lifesaving work by the @CalGuard airlifting more than 200 people to safety overnight from the imminent danger of the #CreekFire The National Guard stands Always Ready, Always There to support our communities and nation in times of need,' General Daniel Hokanson of the 29th Chief of the National Guard Bureau tweeted Sunday morning with a photo of people backed inside a helicopter.</p>

<p>The fire sparked around 6.45pm PDT on Friday and forced evacuations in Fresno and Madera Counties.</p>

<p>By Sunday the Creek Fire grew to more than 71 square miles on Sunday.</p>

<p>As of early Sunday the blaze is 0 percent contained and the cause os being investigated.</p>

<p>Officials initially said Saturday that more than 150 people were cut off at the Mammoth Pool Reservoir in the Forest. Fire radio traffic indicated that multiple people had sustained burn injuries and others broken bones in the Creek Fire, and were being rescued by helicopter.</p>

<p>The first National Guard Chinook to depart loaded more than 50 people, with up to 20 of them requiring immediate medical transport, scanner traffic indicated. </p>

<p>In a statement, the Sierra National Forrest said that 53 individuals were initially rescued from the Mammoth Pool boat launch area, and will be evaluated for injuries.  </p>

<p>Madera County officials said over 200 people were evacuated and 20 people were sent to hospitals. Two people refused evacuations</p>

<p>One Twitter user shared horrifying video driving in a car through the Sierra National Forest surrounded by flames on all sides. She said a forest ranger led them down the road to safety.</p>

<p>'A backpacking trip cut short by unforeseen thunder, ash rain, and having to drive through literal fire to evacuate #SierraNationalForest in time,' she posted.</p>

<p>Lindsey Abbott was camping with her family near Whisky Falls in Madera County when the fire forced them to flee and they got lost, surrounded by the inferno.</p>

<p>'It was so hot, you feel the flames going through the window,' she said.</p>

<p>‘Seeing all the fire that had completely covered our main road, I thought, 'Man, I don't know what we are going to do or where we were going to go or how this is going to end’,’ she added.</p>

<p>A stranger found them and guided them to safety.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office ordered a mandatory evacuation for the Shaver Lake area from Shaver Lake to Littlefield Road. Earlier evacuations were ordered for all of Huntington Lake, Camp Sierra and Big Creek.</p>

<p>In Madera County evacuations were ordered in Cascadel Woods, Kinsman Flat subdivision, Mammoth Pool, Whisky Falls, Clover Meadow, Arnold Meadows, Minarets, all campgrounds off Minarets Road, all campgrounds off Beasore Road north of Grizzley Road.</p>

<p>Labor Day weekend campers were trapped near Mammoth Pool Reservoir in Sierra National Park on Saturday after the Creek Fire exploded and blocked off escape routes</p>

<p>The Creek Fire is threatening a range of mountain resources, including structures, communities and power lines. </p>

<p>The wildfire burning near Shaver Lake exploded to 56 square miles, jumped a river and compromised the only road into the Mammoth Pool Campground, national forest spokesman Dan Tune said. </p>

<p>At least 2,000 structures were threatened in the area about 290 miles north of Los Angeles, where temperatures in the city's San Fernando Valley reached 117 degrees.</p>

<p>Tune said the campers were told to shelter in place until fire crews, aided by water-dropping aircraft, could gain access to the site. Tune said he didn't know how close the fire was burning to the campsite.</p>

<p>'All our resources are working to make that escape route nice and safe for them,' he said.</p>

<p>A sweltering heat wave in California is only compounding the natural crisis the state is seeing as record temperatures this summer and dry lightning sparked dozens of wildfires.</p>

<p>Cal Fire said nearly 12,500 firefighters were battling 22 major fires in the state.</p>

<p>People park their trucks as traffic comes to a stop at Highway CA-168 and Lodge Road on Saturday, the bottom of the 'four-lane,' as residents are evacuated near Shaver Lake</p>

<p>Plumes of smoke rise into the sky as a wildfire burns on the hills near Shaver Lake Saturday. The fire jumped a ridge and has cut off the only evacuation route from Mammoth Pool</p>
