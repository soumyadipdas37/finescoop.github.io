    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Anyone listening to the Prime Minister's broadcast this week would think that coronavirus was spreading like wildfire in the UK because we - the previously amazingly resilient and compliant members of the public - have suddenly become naughty rule-breakers.</p>

<p>In fact, the opposite is true.</p>

<p>To imply (as the Prime Minister did) that somehow the public have misbehaved is a shocking distortion of reality.</p>

<p>The vast majority of citizens have been exceptionally obedient. We've worn masks, stood in socially distanced queues outside supermarkets, and gone without seeing our friends and family for months, all in the name of patriotism - saving our NHS and protecting the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson leaves Downing Street in London to attend Prime Minister's Questions yesterday</p>

<p>The resulting mental and financial hardship cannot be quantified, and now - even though none of the Government's directives seem to have been successful in stopping the virus spreading - we're being told to endure another six months of misery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, more people are dying from cancer than Covid and if you're under 55 you're more more likely to be killed in a motoring accident.</p>

<p>Tim Harford, whose show More or Less on Radio 4 unpicks the truth behind statistics, has predicted that there's a 44-in-one million chance of getting infected with the virus in the UK if we act sensibly - a contrast to the doom-laden scenario predicting 50,000 infections a day from the official Government advisors Whitty and Vallance this week.</p>

<p>And it remains a fact that out of the official deaths from Covid, 95 per cent were patients with other underlying symptoms.</p>

<p>After months of following directives issued by Boris and his band of doom-mongering boffins, Britain has ended up with the worst death rates (per 100,000 members of the population) in Europe.</p>

<p>Consider the huge costs, both financial and physical; because of lockdown, our children weren't educated for months on end, whereas in other countries (like Sweden, which never shut down the economy and didn't make mask wearing compulsory) schools never closed.</p>

<p>Police officers wear face masks while out on patrol in Birmingham last week </p>

<p>British Business has been decimated and our cultural industries the envy of the world - are bankrupt.</p>

<p>Theatres are shut, high streets remain empty with dozens of boarded up shop fronts.</p>

<p>The railways are back in the hands of a Government who always said that was never going to happen. When the furlough scheme ends next month millions of workers will be redundant.</p>

<p>A second health catastrophe is looming as cancer treatments were placed on hold. Months of confinement have seen domestic violence, self harming, depression and suicides soar</p>

<p>And now, there's still no end in sight. Christmas and New Year don't bear thinking about.</p>

<p>I'm afraid the blame for all this has to be placed at one man's door.</p>

<p>Boris has one major flaw - he wants to be to be loved. He's a headline-grabbing crowd pleaser. Bike lanes, garden bridges, stuff like that always looked and sounded exciting when he was Mayor of London.</p>

<p>Commuters at London Waterloo train station just before 9am during rush hour this morning</p>

<p>But being Prime Minister in a pandemic is a much tougher call requiring consistency, calmness and a masterplan all of which is totally beyond him.</p>

<p>Given that Boris frequently speaks without any script, doesn't do detail and never read his briefing notes even when he was mayor of London, the omens at the start of the pandemic were not good.</p>

<p>As things stand, I'd rather David Cameron, John Major, Tony Blair, Keir Starmer or even bossyboots headgirl Theresa May was in charge.</p>

<p>Anyone would be handling Covid better than Boris - and I can't imagine any of them, even Blair, being shameless enough to try to pin the blame on voters.</p>

<p>His dithering at the start of the year when the virus was spreading in China and just arriving in Europe proved catastrophic.</p>

<p>A two week delay in imposing lockdown resulted in the worse death rate in Europe after an idiotic Government directive that care homes should accept infected patients from hospitals.</p>

<p>As ten of thousands of our elderly folk were decimated (denied visits from their closest family as they wheezed their last breaths) it became apparent that Boris had seriously misjudged where the pandemic would wreak the most harm.</p>

<p>Ever since, he's been striving to catch up, felled by the virus after he refused to social distance.</p>

<p>Commuters wear face masks as they board a London Overground train in South London today</p>

<p>Overweight, he nearly lost his life, and in the weeks since as he's fought to get fit he's become the lamest-duck leader in Europe. Our tracing and testing programmes are a joke.</p>

<p>The pandemic has seen Boris adopt a new persona - the clown has re-cast himself as a battle leader in the Churchill mould of his hero.</p>

<p>But Churchill knew which battles to fight.</p>

<p>Boris can't decide whether to eradicate the virus - which is impossible - or contain it.</p>

<p>And so we - his embattled troops - have struggled to abide by one set of directives after another that patently have no clear objective in mind.</p>

<p>Since that first doom-laden TV broadcast in March when we were ordered to lock ourselves up, we've been given whacky diagrams, incomprehensible graphs and more changes of tack than a shipping forecast.</p>

<p>As confusion has grown, experts who didn't toe the party line were banned from speaking at official briefings.</p>

<p>The truth is, there's no such thing as an infallible 'science' that can predict the path of this virus.</p>

<p>This week's directives don't stand a snowball in hell's chance of success and Covid-19 is here for the forseeable future.</p>

<p>Only a vaccine will have any impact on the infection rate. Local lockdowns aren't working and there's no one to enforce them in any case.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon (pictured at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh this week) is determined to prove she's even more macho than blundering superdad Boris</p>

<p>Even with the grotesque prospect of troops patrolling our cities trying to get drunks to put a mask on and go home.</p>

<p>With universities open for business, students are partying behind closed doors after months of imprisonment with mum and dad, so expect new outbreaks and lockdowns in campuses around the country.</p>

<p>As for the hospitality industry, shutting at 10pm will do nothing to curb infections – only 5% of which are accounted for by the sector - but it will see more businesses fold with tens of thousands of redundancies.</p>

<p>The only thing it will achieve is pubs and restaurants putting everyone on the street at the same time, drunk on a last dash to beat last orders and fight over taxis back to illegal and unpoliced drinking sessions at home, with lashings of domestic abuse on the side.</p>

<p>If you don't believe me, ask Scots and Australians who can still remember labouring under ridiculously early closing times until surprisingly recently.</p>

<p>Moreover - following orders from Dishi Rishi it turns out that we've spent the last few weeks eating out to save the economy at public expense, when we could have been sitting in our back gardens enjoying the fine weather breathing in our own germs without exposing ourselves to anyone else's.</p>

<p>Like everyone else, I went back to work when the rules were relaxed.</p>

<p>Now, we're supposed to work from home again - which will result in city centres dying as coffee shops, restaurants and all the businesses that service commuters lose out once more.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon is determined to prove she's even more macho than blundering superdad Boris.</p>

<p>And now she's pressurising him into matching her diktat that bans anyone from visiting anyone else in their home even though none of her cruel and unusual 'big ideas' have seen Scotland's infection rate drop below that of the rest of the UK.</p>

<p>But there's one thing Boris doesn't seem to have considered. Britain had already voted with its feet and largely gone into voluntary lockdown days before he made it law.</p>

<p>And when summer arrived most people instinctively knew it had gone on too long and were itching to get back to work and real-life, weeks before he made it official policy.</p>

<p>Now, as winter draws on WE will decide when it's time to go into hibernation. Not the Wizard of Oz who currently resides in Downing Street or his advisors and their dodgy infection charts designed to scare us into submission.</p>
