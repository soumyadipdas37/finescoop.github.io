        <p>Kim Kardashian announced on Tuesday night that her family's signature show Keeping Up With the Kardashians will come to an end next year after 20 seasons.</p>

<p>Over the course of 14 years, the hit E! show has welcomed ten new additions in the form of mini Kardashian-Jenners who will no doubt take over the family dynasty one day.</p>

<p>With secret pregnancies, surrogacies and cheating scandals, KUWTK has aired every intimate and private moment with the famous family.</p>

<p>Family! Over the course of 14 years, Keeping Up With the Kardashians has welcomed ten new additions in the form of mini Kardashian-Jenners who will no doubt take over the family dynasty one day </p>

<p>While momager Kris Jenner has adapted from being a mother-of-six to a grandmother-of-ten over the course of 14 years. </p>

<p>We take a look at the mini Kardashian-Jenners who have been welcomed over the past 20 seasons of KUWTK...    </p>

<p>Kim Kardashian and Kanye West </p>

<p>Children: North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, 16 months</p>

<p>Kim, 39, and Kanye, 43, welcomed their first child, North, seven, in 2013 after going public with their romance in 2012.   </p>

<p>After marrying in a star-studded Paris ceremony in 2014, the KUWTK veteran welcomed son Saint, four, in 2015.</p>

<p>During her pregnancy with North and Saint, Kim battled with the life-threatening condition placenta accreta and was warned by doctors it was too risky to carry again.</p>

<p>Children:  Kim, 39, and Kanye, 43, welcomed their first child, North, seven, in 2013 after going public with their romance in 2012</p>

<p>The condition occurs when all or part of the placenta remains attached to the uterine wall after childbirth.</p>

<p>Kim and Kanye made the decision to welcome baby number three, Chicago, two, via a surrogate.  </p>

<p>The star grew close to her surrogate, who appeared anonymously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians before welcoming Chicago in January of 2018.</p>

<p>Kim and Kanye also chose to welcome baby number four, Psalm, 16 months, via surrogate although they used a different woman. He was born in May 2019. </p>

<p>Children: They have children North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, 16 months with their youngest children being welcomed via surrogacy </p>

<p>The star recently revealed that the couple and their surrogate had a therapist during her pregnancy with Chicago.</p>

<p>Kim revealed the news on on Laura Wasser's iHeart Radio original podcast All's Fair.  </p>

<p>She said: 'You get your surrogate attorney, you get your surrogate broker and then the broker recommended that we use a therapist that would communicate with me first and then communicate with her and kind of be our liaison.' </p>

<p>During her surrogate pregnancy with Psalm, she opted to forego the therapist, 'because I kind of knew the drill.'    </p>

<p>As well as being a risk to her health, Kim admitted that she found pregnancy 'the worst experience of her life!'</p>

<p>Writing on her website, she explained: 'I'm gonna keep it real: For me, pregnancy is the worst experience of my life!'</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian and ex Scott Disick </p>

<p>Children: Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five </p>

<p>Kourtney, 41, and Scott, 37, welcomed the first Kardashian-Jenner grandchild after she gave birth to son Mason, 10, in 2009. </p>

<p>Three years later, in 2012, the former couple welcomed their middle child and daughter Penelope, eight.</p>

<p>Children: Kourtney, 41, and Scott, 37, have Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five </p>

<p>In 2014, Kourtney and Scott welcomed their final child together, son Reign, five.</p>

<p>Just a year later, in 2015, the former couple decided to call time on their tumultuous romance after nearly ten years of dating.</p>

<p>Scott went on to have an on-off romance with Lionel Richie's daughter, Sofia, 22, although they split last month.</p>

<p>Split: Just a year after welcoming their youngest child, in 2015, the former couple decided to call time on their tumultuous romance after nearly ten years of dating</p>

<p>While Kourtney enjoyed an on-off relationship with model Younes Bendjima, 27. </p>

<p>The star recently hinted that she wants a fourth child after fans asked whether she was pregnant on a stunning image posted in April.</p>

<p>After one person wrote: 'You are pregnant,' Kourtney replied with: 'Put the blessing out there though,' followed by a prayer emoji. </p>

<p>Khloe Kardashian and on-off partner Tristan Thompson</p>

<p>Children: True, two </p>

<p>Khloe, 36, and Tristan, 29, welcomed their first child together in April 2018.  </p>

<p>Yet just days before she gave birth, the NBA star was caught on tape stepping out with several other women and it was revealed he had cheated on her while she was pregnant.  </p>

<p>Khloe aired the scandal and her birth on series 15 of KUWTK, where she allowed Tristan to be part of it and she took him back. </p>

<p>Sweet: Khloe, 36, and Tristan, 29, welcomed their first child together in April 2018 </p>

<p>Tweeting her decision at the time, she wrote: 'Regardless of what Tristan did to me, I was never going to take that moment away from True or Tristan.</p>

<p>'She should not be punished for his actions. He is her father and they both deserve to love one another as deeply as they possibly can.' </p>

<p>When the scenes were finally aired on television, Khloe tweeted: 'Tonight’s episode is an uncomfortable and super emotional one for me.</p>

<p>Drama: Yet just days before she gave birth, the NBA star was caught on tape stepping out with several other women and it was revealed he had cheated on her while she was pregnant </p>

<p>'But when we signed up for this show over a decade ago, we signed up for a reality show, which meant showing you guys inside our lives, the good, the bad and the ugly.'</p>

<p>After choosing to work on her relationship with Tristan following his cheating while she was pregnant, a scandal with a family friend pushed Khloe over the edge.</p>

<p>The family learnt about Tristan allegedly hooking up with Kylie Jenner's then-best friend Jordyn Woods and it was all caught on camera.</p>

<p>Claims: The couple are said to have rekindled their romance recently and fans speculated that Khloe could be expecting her second child earlier this month, although an insider denied the rumours to E! News </p>

<p>Khloe eventually decided to split from the athlete and father of her daughter, in an intense saga, as her family and friends rallied around her.</p>

<p>The couple are said to have rekindled their romance recently and fans speculated that Khloe could be expecting her second child earlier this month.</p>

<p>Yet according to insiders at E! News, the star is not pregnant and is on the 'same page' with Tristan about their family.  </p>

<p>Kylie Jenner and ex Travis Scott </p>

<p>Children: Stormi, two </p>

<p>Kylie, 23, and Travis, 28, welcomed their first child Stormi in 2018 after a whirlwind romance.</p>

<p>The make-up mogul kept her pregnancy completely secret and she was only caught on camera a handful of times in nine months. </p>

<p>Kylie went to great lengths to keep her pregnancy quiet, with her famous sisters even joking she was the 'new' Rob Kardashian as they branded her 'reclusive'.</p>

<p>Whirlwind: Kylie, 23, and Travis, 28, welcomed their first child Stormi in 2018 after a whirlwind romance </p>

<p>Before her pregnancy, the mum had created a strong social media presence and always updating her fans on her whereabouts.</p>

<p>Yet, in the nine months, Kylie dropped off the social media platforms only uploading a number of selfies which were closely cropped in on her face.</p>

<p>Coming back with a bang, the star dropped the bombshell she had given birth with an emotive video which sent her fans into a meltdown.</p>

<p>The youngest sibling kept a documentation of her pregnancy journey including snaps and videos to share with her admirers once Stormi was born.</p>

<p>Secret pregnancy! Kylie went to great lengths to keep her pregnancy quiet, with her famous sisters even joking she was the 'new' Rob Kardashian as they branded her 'reclusive'</p>

<p>In the end, Kylie managed to enjoy her pregnancy as she wished 'privately' with only a handful of close family and friends knowing about the arrival of Stormi.   </p>

<p>Last year, Kylie and her baby daddy Travis were said to have 'taken space apart' from their two-year romantic relationship, according to TMZ. </p>

<p>In January, the star revealed that she wants four children, she said on a YouTube video: 'I see myself for sure having four kids. I just don't know when.</p>

<p>'I don't have a timeline for this and I don't know if I'm going to have four kids tomorrow or if I'm going to have four kids in seven years.'</p>

<p>Their child: Rob, 33, and Blac Chyna, real name Angela Renée White, 32, welcomed their first child Dream, three, in 2016 </p>

<p>Former flames: After welcoming Dream, the couple split just weeks later. Since then there have been a number of legal battles between Chyna and Rob as well as other members of the Kardashian family (pictured in 2016) </p>

<p>The couple got engaged in April 2016 after a whirlwind three months as she flashed a huge $325k diamond ring online.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show is ending after 14 years on air.</p>

<p>Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which helped make Kim and her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie and Kendall household names and launched their careers in the fashion and beauty business, will air its last season early next year.</p>

<p>There was no reasons for the decision but E! said in a statement that it respects ‘the family's decision to live their lives without our cameras.’ In recent years numerous siblings, most recently Kourtney, have been reluctant to film the show. Kim has also endured a turbulent year with her husband Kanye West’s mental health battle and controversial presidential run putting unprecedented strain on her marriage.</p>

<p>Throughout the years the show chronicled key events in the personal and professional lives of the California family, including Kim Kardashian's marriages to Kris Humphries and West, an armed robbery in Paris, the break-up of Khloe Kardashian's marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom, and the transition of family patriarch Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner.</p>

<p>In an Instagram message posted on Tuesday, Kim, 39, wrote: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians. </p>

<p>Shock announcement: Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show is ending after 14 years on air </p>

<p>'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.</p>

<p>'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.</p>

<p>'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'</p>

<p>Where it all began: Above is a picture of the first viewing party for Keeping Up with the Kardashians way back in 2007 ahead of it airing on E! for the first time</p>

<p>'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'</p>

<p>The E! reality show first premiered in 2007, originated with Ryan Seacrest, who served as an executive producer </p>

<p>In April this year, it was claimed the show had its lowing viewing figures which had sunk to under 900k. </p>

<p>At its peak, 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.</p>

<p>The series will return for season 19 on Thursday, Sept. 17 followed by one last season in 2021. </p>

<p>Breaking the news: Kim was the first person to reveal the show's demise, as she has always been the star of the series (pictured in 2019) </p>
