        <p>Tiffany Trump paid her respects to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday after calling her a 'trailblazer for women in the legal field' in a social media tribute. </p>

<p>The president's youngest daughter was among thousands of mourners who visited the building to honor the late justice, who lies in repose under the Portico at the top of the front steps. </p>

<p>The 26-year-old, who recently graduated from Georgetown Law School, was dressed in all black when she arrived at the Supreme Court, where her father, President Donald Trump, and stepmother, First Lady Melania Trump, were booed earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Paying tribute: Tiffany Trump, 26, paid her respects to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday</p>

<p>Mourning: The recent Georgetown Law graduate was dressed in all black aside from her black and white loafers </p>

<p>Tiffany wore a black blazer, black skinny pants with a white stripe running down each leg, loafers, and a black face mask to visit the steps where Ginsburg's coffin lies. </p>

<p>While the president has had a wavering stance on masks, Tiffany has been faithfully wearing one for most of her public outings.  </p>

<p>For the past few weeks, Tiffany has been staying in New York, where her mother Marla Maples and older brothers Don Jr. and Eric live. It's unclear when she returned to Washington, D.C. </p>

<p>The first daughter bypassed the crowd when she arrived at the Supreme Court with an unidentified woman and her Secret Service detail. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court confirmed on Friday that Ginsburg died surrounded by her family at her home in Washington D.C. following complications with metastatic pancreatic cancer. She was 87.  </p>

<p>Protected: Tiffany was accompanied by her Secret Service detail during the visit </p>

<p>Support system: Tiffany was also joined by an unidentified woman who was also dressed in black </p>

<p>Ginsburg, who served for 27 years on the highest court of the land, had battled several bouts of cancer after first being diagnosed in 2009.</p>

<p>Social media quickly flooded with tributes and condolences for Ginsburg, including a series of tweets from President Trump's youngest daughter.</p>

<p>Tiffany first shared photos of Ginsburg on Twitter and said she watched her speak during a 2017 lecture at the university.</p>

<p>'In 2017, I was honored to attend a lecture by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at Georgetown Law,' she wrote. '#RBG was a pioneer for women and gender equality— graduating law school when there were only 9 female students and then becoming the 2nd woman Supreme Court Justice.'</p>

<p>Honoring her: Tiffany shared a tribute to Ginsburg on both Twitter and Instagram on Friday</p>

<p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg (pictured) died Friday evening in Washington D.C. after a long battle with metastatic pancreatic cancer</p>

<p>In a Twitter thread later Friday evening, Tiffany recalled Ginsburg's 'surprising' friendship with former Justice Antonin Scalia and noted their commitment to justice despite their warring ideologies.</p>

<p>Scalia, who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1986, was known for his conservative rulings and opinions. Ginsburg often advocated for more liberal and progressive rulings. </p>

<p>'Thank you, Justice Ginsburg for being a trailblazer for women in the legal field, a pioneer for women and gender equality, and for showing that patriotism hinges not on agreement, but on the unwavering commitment to persevere, to listen, to learn, and to develop together.' Tiffany wrote.</p>

<p>'Justice Ginsburg, an icon of the left, and Justice Scalia, an icon of the right, were great friends- regardless of their different ideologies. Ginsburg admired Scalia for his love of the constitution and his fierce devotion to defend it how he believed was intended.</p>

<p>Tiffany Trump said on Twitter that she 'was honored to attend a lecture by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg' in 2017 at Georgetown Law</p>

<p>In a series of tweets, Tiffany highlighted the 'surprising' friendship between Ginsburg and former Justice Antonin Scalia </p>

<p>'Ginsburg often disagreed with his jurisprudence, but she too sought to defend the Constitution how she believed it was intended to by the founders. Scalia once even gave Ginsburg an advance notice of his dissent so Ginsburg could make her majority opinion better...'</p>

<p>Tiffany added that Ginsburg and Scalia's difference in opinion was dwarfed by their patriotism for their fellow Americans. Scalia served on the Supreme Court for 34 years before he died in 2016.</p>

<p>'What both understood about each other was that, despite their vast differences of opinion, they shared a truly unique bond - that of dedicating their life to advancing this country,' wrote Tiffany.</p>

<p>'May we learn from your devout commitment to justice so that we, too, may find extraordinary (and perhaps surprising) friendships among our fellow Americans, and continue your work to build a better and more just nation.' </p>

<p>Tiffany shared the same message, along with an image of Ginsburg, on her Instagram page on Friday.   </p>

<p>Ginsburg announced she was undergoing chemotherapy to treat lesions on her liver shortly after the Supreme Court finished its work for the summer,</p>

<p>It was the fifth time she's dealt with cancer in the past 20 years. At the same time, she said she would continue to serve on the court.</p>

<p>Her death paves the way for President Trump to expand his conservative majority on the Supreme Court ahead of November's election.</p>

<p>Ginsburg, the leader of the court’s four-member liberal wing, voiced concerns about the political impact of her passing in the days leading up to her death.</p>

<p>'My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,' the legal pioneer said in a statement dictated to her granddaughter Clara Spera days before her death.  </p>

<p>But Trump has vowed to move forward in the confirmation process and will name his replacement on Saturday at the White House. He is expected to name a conservative to fill the liberal judge's place on the bench. </p>

<p>The president and first lady were met with boos when they paid their respects to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Supreme Court on Thursday, though he claimed he couldn't hear them. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump pay respects as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Thursday</p>

<p>Crowds around the Supreme Court booed President Trump and yelled 'vote him out'</p>

<p>President Donald Trump said he couldn't hear the protesters who yelled at him and first lady Melania Trump when they paid their respects to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Supreme Court</p>

<p>A crowd yelled 'Honor her wish' and 'Vote him out' as the first couple stood at the top of the steps at Ginsburg's flag-draped coffin, their heads bowed and faces covered by masks.</p>

<p>Trump said he could hear a 'sound' but that was all.</p>

<p>'I think it was just a political chant. We could hardly hear it,' he told reporters at the White House after his visit. 'Somebody said there was chanting. They were right next to the media. We could hardly hear too much. We could hear a sound but it wasn’t very much.</p>

<p>It's rare for President Trump to hear any criticism or booing in his public appearances. His campaign rallies and events are typically filled with cheering supporters who offer constant applause and adoration. The rare protester is quickly escorted out.</p>

<p>Thousands of mourners have lined up at the Supreme Court to pay tribute to the late justice, who became a cultural icon and feminist hero. Many of them supported Ginsburg's liberal philosophy, putting them in direct opposition to the president.</p>

<p>'Honor her wish,' was in reference to Ginsburg's dying request that the winner of the November presidential election appoint her successor. </p>

<p>The first couple arrived for their short visit at the back of the Supreme Court building and walked through it and out its front door to view Ginsburg's coffin. That could have been for security reasons given the heavy crowds and lines of people in front of the court.</p>

<p>The Trumps spent 11 minutes at the court before returning to the White House. </p>

<p>The White House called the boos and chants 'appalling' and 'disrespectful.'</p>

<p>'Everybody has a first amendment in this country, but I thought it was appalling and disrespectful thing to do as the president honored Justice Ginsburg,’ White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at her briefing Thursday.</p>

<p>She said, however, it was 'certainly to be expected when you're part of the swamp.'</p>

<p>‘I travel with the president all across the country. And everywhere we go, the streets are lined with support like I don't think any other president has had previously,' she added.</p>
