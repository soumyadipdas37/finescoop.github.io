        <p>Katie Price has received a hot pink scooter to travel around in as she continues to recover from an operation on her broken feet.</p>

<p>The former glamour model, 42, underwent surgery earlier this month after breaking her ankle and feet in a horror accident during a holiday in Turkey.</p>

<p>The star - who is now resting at home on doctors orders - will now be able to travel around near her home on the scooter. She is currently in the middle of a two year driving ban.</p>

<p>Here she comes: Katie Price has received a hot pink scooter to travel around in as she continues to recover from an operation on her broken feet</p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'Katie will be able to claim back a bit of independence, </p>

<p>'The scooter has been given a total make over by Robbie at Valetmagic - he reached out to Katie offering his team to work their magic, putting a smile back on her face will certainly be speeding up her recovery. </p>

<p>The star added to The Sun: 'I won't be breaking any speed limits on this - that's for sure.'   </p>

<p>Helping hand: The former glamour model was assisted by daughter Princess as she attempted to ride the colourful scooter outside her Surrey home</p>

<p>Awkward: Katie didn't look comfortable as she gingerly moved from one vehicle to another</p>

<p>All aboard: Princess tried out her mother's wheelchair after she climbed into the four wheeler, which came with a natty basket fixed onto its steering chassis </p>

<p>The scooter has been customised to Katie's standards and features a 'Pricey' registration plate. </p>

<p>Katie recently revealed she was stepping out of the spotlight on Thursday on medical advice as she has been told to 'rest in order to heal'.</p>

<p>Amid the social media hiatus, Katie appeared in a promotional fake tan video shared on her Instagram on Sunday evening - with her representatives confirming this was a pre-scheduled post.      </p>

<p>Guidance: The 42-year old appeared to get one or two useful tips before she gave her new ride a test drive </p>

<p>Let's go: Katie appeared to be in high spirits as she set off on her personalised scooter</p>

<p>Faithful friend: The brunette was joined by her pet pooch while navigating the vehicle across the street </p>

<p>They said: 'I can confirm that Katie has not returned to social media.  Katie's team posted the Instagram and this was not posted by Katie herself.</p>

<p>'It was  filmed prior to her hiatus.' </p>

<p>The star posted a statement to Instagram Stories on Thursday, which read: 'Katie is taking some time out of the media spotlight. </p>

<p>Get well soon: It is hoped that the scooter will help speed up Katie's recovery from foot surgery</p>

<p>My girl: The former glamour model got an affectionate hug from her daughter as she sat in her wheelchair</p>

<p>When push comes to shove: Katie was aided by a friend as she examined her new scooter </p>

<p>'Her family and Dr's have told Katie that she must rest in order to heal. Katie wants to thank everyone for their ongoing support and will be back when she feels ready.'    </p>

<p>Katie's representative told MailOnline: 'Katie is taking a much needed break. Katie has found the past few weeks terribly draining, both mentally and physically challenging and in order to bounce back is convalescing.' </p>

<p>Yet despite her Instagram statement, just minutes later, Kate posted a supportive tweet to her pal Kerry Katona, which she hastily deleted. It is likely it was pre-scheduled before her announcement. </p>

<p>Injury: Katie has been using a wheelchair to get around since her horror accident (pictured this month)</p>

<p>Here she is: Amid the social media hiatus, Katie appeared in a promotional fake tan video shared on her Instagram on Sunday evening - with her representatives confirming this was a pre-scheduled post</p>

<p>It read: 'Loved @KerryKatona7's newest YouTube video of their holiday in a £15 MILLION SUPER VILLA!!! Go check out how amazing this place is!!!' she then posted links to Kerry's YouTube. </p>

<p>Earlier in the week, she bemoaned the challenges of being in a cast after breaking both her feet, as she attempted to have a bath on Monday.  </p>

<p>The former glamour model took to Instagram Stories to share a glimpse of the tiring attempts to get washed off, warning fans she couldn't get her casts wet.</p>

<p>Ahead of her statement, Katie had returned to social media on Monday after being rushed to hospital with a suspected infection over the weekend, following surgery on her broken feet earlier this month. </p>

<p>Recovery: They said: 'I can confirm that Katie has not returned to social media. Katie's team posted the Instagram and this was not posted by Katie herself. 'It was filmed prior to her hiatus'</p>

<p>On her Instagram Stories, Katie revealed she first had to try and get from her wheelchair into the bath with her feet in the air.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'Got to use my upper body strength to get in the bath legs up run the water and CANNOT get my cast wet.. such a mission to have a bath.'  </p>

<p>This comes amid claims Katie has been warned by doctors that she must keep her legs elevated in order to aid her recovery, after she was rushed to A&amp;E at Epsom hospital in Surrey. </p>

<p>The star was said to have been in 'excruciating agony' earlier on Saturday when she'd visited the hospital, according to The Sun.</p>

<p>A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Katie has been sent home and told in no uncertain terms that she must keep her legs up or they won't heal properly.' </p>

<p>The insider went on to say: 'She's just going to have to lie down and give herself time to heal.'  </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted Katie's representatives for comment at the time.   </p>

<p>It was reported earlier in the day that she was suspected to have an infection and required further treatment at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, just a week after undergoing major surgery.</p>

<p>The star broke both her feet during a freak accident while on a family holiday in Turkey earlier this month.   </p>

<p>An insider told The Sun: 'Katie was in excruciating agony all night, couldn't eat, couldn't focus and nothing was working. Painkillers weren't touching it so pals rushed her to A&amp;E in Epsom.</p>

<p>'Doctors decided to move her to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital for further treatment but the fear is she could have an infection.'   </p>

<p>A representative for Katie Price told MailOnline: 'She had a terrible night. I can confirm Katie was taken to her local A&amp;E hospital ( Epsom ) and then referred back to the Chelsea and Westminster.'</p>

<p>It comes after Katie was left devastated after a surgeon confirmed the extent of her 'smashed' feet and stated she 'couldn't have done a worse job' of injuring herself.   </p>

<p>Taking to her YouTube channel earlier this month, Katie explained: 'The surgeon made it clear that I couldn't have done a worse job to myself. </p>

<p>'They're smashed, broken and it's bad, really bad. It's bad, life changing injuries what I've done, so they're just going to do their best.'  </p>

<p>She shared her doctor's recent diagnosis before entering surgery on August 14 2020, as they confirmed her injuries are 'life-changing' and will leave her with horrendous scars.   </p>

<p>Tough time: Katie recently revealed that she is stepping out of the spotlight on doctor's warning as she has been told to 'rest in order to heal'</p>

<p>Honest: The star posted a statement to Instagram Stories on Thursday, which read: 'Katie is taking some time out of the media spotlight.'</p>

<p>Katie discussed her shock at hearing the news while wearing a medical robe and resting on her hospital bed, as she prepared for her next operation at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital. </p>

<p>The reality star recorded herself eight hours later following the operation,and she seemed in brighter spirits as the anaesthetic slowly wore off.</p>

<p>She revealed that a member of staff told her, when they opened her legs up in surgery, they were more 'smashed and mangled' than they appeared on the x-ray and the op was much harder than anticipated.  </p>

<p>Katie experienced the horrendous accident after she jumped off a wall at the Land of Legends theme park in Turkey and broke both her ankles and feet.  </p>

<p>It's been a stressful year for Katie after she was admitted to The Priory earlier in 2020 following a string of personal woes, including being declared bankrupt and dealing with her mother Amy's terminal illness. </p>

<p>The statement added: 'Her family and Dr's have told Katie that she must rest in order to heal. Katie wants to thank everyone for their ongoing support and will be back when she feels ready.' (pictured with her boyfriend Carl Woods) </p>

<p>Bizarre? Yet despite her statement, just minutes later, Kate posted a supportive tweet to her pal Kerry Katona, which she hastily deleted. It is likely it was pre-scheduled before her announcement</p>

<p>Talking about her rehabilitation centre visit on her reality series My Crazy Life, she admitted that 'the only reason I'm here is because of my children'.</p>

<p>Katie was spotted outside the The Priory in February 2020, following a host of rehab stints over the past two years in the wake of legal issues and substance abuse.  </p>

<p>The episode saw the TV star in the run up to her breakdown with 'severe stress' as she tried to cope with bankruptcy and her split from on-off fiancé Kris Boyson.  She is now happily loved-up with new beau Carl Woods.   </p>

<p>Katie last visited The Priory in September 2018 and spent 28 days in the facility after her family urged her to seek help following wild partying antics in Mallorca.</p>

<p>Medical advice: Katie was warned by doctors to keep her feet elevated as she returned home on Saturday after being rushed to hospital following surgery on her broken feet</p>

<p>At the time, she was confronted by her loved ones after shocking footage emerged of her rapping 'I love coke' during a booze-fuelled hen do.</p>

<p>Katie broke down after the intervention and admitted she needed help to get over her chaotic behaviour, which she blamed on her PTSD.</p>

<p>In November 2019, the mother-of-five was declared bankrupt at a court after facing further legal action over her spiralling debts, said to be worth £800,000.</p>

<p>The CBB star had been pursued by creditors and the taxman after revealing she has spent her entire £45million fortune.  </p>

<p>Stay strong: According to the reality star, she is convinced she will make a full recovery and doesn't care about scarring on her feet as long as she is able to walk again</p>

<p>Meanwhile Katie split from fiancé Kris, 31, late last year after a nearly two-year on-off relationship.</p>

<p>The couple were thought to have rekindled their romance in December with a festive 'make-or-break' trip to New York.</p>

<p>Katie admitted she had cheated on the fitness enthusiast twice over the course of their relationship.</p>

<p>She was last seen outside The Priory in February 2020 with a source telling MailOnline: 'Katie was at the Priory for an appointment with a welfare doctor as protocol with ITV for filming My Crazy Life'.</p>

<p>If you have been affected by this story, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123 or visit www.samaritans.org.</p>

<p>Family: Katie is mother to daughters Princess, 13, Bunny, six, and sons Jett, seven, Junior, 15 and Harvey, 18</p>
