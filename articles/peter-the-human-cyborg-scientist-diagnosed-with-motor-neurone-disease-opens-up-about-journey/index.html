        <p>A scientist diagnosed with motor neurone disease teared up as he heard his new robot voice singing Gene Wilder's Pure Imagination after losing the biological ability to do so.</p>

<p>Peter Scott-Morgan, 62, from Devon, appears in Channel 4's documentary Peter: The Human Cyborg tonight, which documents his battle over two years to save his life by turning himself into the world's first cyborg using technology.</p>

<p>The scientist, who lives with his husband Francis, was particularly concerned about losing his voice, saying: 'I really want, when I'm, locked in, to sound a bit like me and convey some of the emotion and hopefully gain a bit of the empathy from people in my current state. Without that, I think I'll feel very very isolated.'</p>

<p>In one particularly emotional moment, Peter and his family gather to hear his new 'robot' voice, which will be his main way of communicating after he is locked in.</p>

<p>The family are overwhelmed with emotion when it is revealed the scientists have programmed the voice to sing, an ability which at that stage, Peter has already lost.</p>

<p>Peter Scott Morgan, 62, from Devon, appears in Channel 4's documentary Peter: The Human Cyborg tonight, which documents his battle over two years to save his life by turning himself into the world's first cyborg using technology (pictured with his husband Francis) </p>

<p>Peter was first diagnosed in November 2016, after noticing that he couldn't shake his foot while getting out of the bath.  </p>

<p>After a series of tests, he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2017, which destroys the nerve cells which control muscles. </p>

<p>He explains: 'Being locked in is not ideal. It's not what I had planned or wanted. It is what it is. It is a shock. </p>

<p>Meanwhile his husband Francis says: 'It is, how do we deal with this. I've shed a tear. I've thought how on earth am I going to do this? It's traumatic.'</p>

<p>The scientist remains determine to use technology to transform his body before being 'locked in' by the condition </p>

<p>Peter dreams of transforming his body into part human, part machine, in order to help improve his quality of life when his condition deteriorates.   </p>

<p>As part of the transformation, and to prevent suffocating, he will breathe through a tube that emerges through his throat.</p>

<p>However he will be mute and needs a synthetic voice that sounds exactly like him in order to be able to communicate  </p>

<p>He says: 'There is no technology I would not consider. This is cyborg territory and I am willing to be a human guinea pig to see just how far we can turn science fiction into a reality.'</p>

<p>At one stage, Peter has a laryngectomy to reroute his throat, disconnecting his lungs from his mouth and allowing him to breathe through a tube above his chest. However, he also loses his biological voice in the process </p>

<p>By summer 2018, less than a year since Peter's diagnosis, he is beginning his transformation to become part human and part machine.  </p>

<p>He speaks with an Edinburgh based computer scientist, Matthew Aylett, who can make synthetic voices.</p>

<p>Motor neurone disease is a rare condition that mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s, but it can affect adults of all ages.</p>

<p>It's caused by a problem with cells in the brain and nerves called motor neurones. These cells gradually stop working over time. It's not known why this happens.</p>

<p>Having a close relative with motor neurone disease, or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia, can sometimes mean you're more likely to get it. But it doesn't run in families in most cases.</p>

<p>Early symptoms can include weakness in your ankle or leg, like finding it hard to walk upstairs; slurred speech, finding it hard to swallow, a weak grip, and gradual weight loss</p>

<p>If you have these sympthoms, you should see a GP. They will consider other possible conditions and can refer you to a specialist called a neurologist if necessary.</p>

<p>If a close relative has motor neurone disease or frontotemporal dementia and you're worried you may be at risk of it – they may refer you to a genetic counsellor to talk about your risk and any tests you can have</p>

<p>Source: NHS UK </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter explains: 'One of the big problems when I email people who are locked in, they say of all the faculties that they lost, speech is the worst. The most traumatic. the one that made them feel most disabled. </p>

<p>'It is impossible even if they use text as speech. </p>

<p>'They aren't communicating their personality, they aren't able to convey their emotion.' </p>

<p>Before Matt attempts to clone Peter's voice, he needs some raw materials, so Peter spends weeks in a recording studio speaking in as many different ways as he can.  </p>

<p>Six months later, he and Francis sit down to listen to the voice he will be hearing for the rest of his life for the very first time.</p>

<p>But the couple are stunned when they heard the robotic and disjointed voice, with Francis saying: 'I think that sounds a little robotic. I think we can do better.'</p>

<p>And later, he told the camera: 'His voice, he did put on a brave face, but at the end of the day what we heard we were hoping for a lot better. </p>

<p>'We'd hoped to be in a slightly better place than we are at the moment. Bit disappointing. Seems like we have a lot more to do.'</p>

<p>But time is running out and at the rate Peter's MND is progressing, he will be completely locked in within a year.</p>

<p>He says: 'It's about as stressful as anything I've done in my career.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Francis says: 'Physically it's obvious his muscles are wasting away. It's a lot quicker than we thought. </p>

<p>'We were assuming we wouldn't be here for - we were hoping for two or three years. Maybe longer. But this is where we are.'</p>

<p>Weeks later, Peter's health deteriorates further and the couple are forced to make some tough decisions.</p>

<p>He decides to type out what he wants to say using his eyes by using cameras that will track his pupils as he looks at a computer screen.</p>

<p>Peter undergoes a series of operations throughout the documentary in order to embrace technology and transform into part human, part cyborg </p>

<p>He says: 'If I didn't have faith that technology would allow me not just to speak but to interact as a human being, this would be a huge deal.'  </p>

<p>When the cameras next visit Francis and Peter, his paralysis has now reached his neck and he is struggling to swallow and cough.</p>

<p>He plans to have a laryngectomy which will reroute his throat, disconnecting his lungs from his mouth and will breathe through a tube baove his chest.</p>

<p>Though the operation could save his life, he will never speak again with the surgeon explaining: 'I have a number of patients who would rather die from cancer than have laryngectomy.'</p>

<p>The scientist decides he will communicate using his eyes to type out words and phrases which will be spoken by a synthetic, robot voice based on his own </p>

<p>Meanwhile Francis adds: 'It is a lot to come to terms with. Just having a conversation is going to be very different.</p>

<p>'It makes you value your relationship more because doors close more. Our challenge is to keep the doors open as much as we can.'</p>

<p>Peter underwent a laryngectomy, meaning he lost his physical voice, but in doing so, he will avoid the added danger of saliva potentially entering his lungs, due to his condition.</p>

<p>A laryngectomy is the removal of the larynx and separation of the airway from the mouth, nose and esophagus. </p>

<p>In a total laryngectomy, the entire larynx is removed (including the vocal folds, hyoid bone, epiglottis, thyroid and cricoid cartilage and a few tracheal cartilage rings).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And, after a disappointing first attempt at the voice, Matt is aiming for something less robotic. </p>

<p>With just two months before Peter is due to lose his voice forever, the clone is ready, and the family gather to listen to a sample.</p>

<p>Matt wants to show what the voice is capable of and programmes it to do something Peter already can't - sing.  </p>

<p>Peter is amazed as he listens to the robot voice singing, with tears in his eyes, calling it 'unbelievable.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Francis can't contain his emotion and bursts into tears, saying: 'It's just amazing. Incredibly clever.'</p>

<p>Peter says: 'I can hear...getting back something that I never thought I would.'</p>

<p>37 minutes IN </p>

<p>By the autumn of 2019, Peter feels he has done all he can to give his cyborg the power of speech and goes into hosptial to have his voice removed.</p>

<p>He undergoes a laryngectomy, meaning he lost his physical voice, but in doing so, he avoids the added danger of saliva potentially entering his lungs, due to his condition. </p>

<p>Francis explains: 'It's an odd combination because obviously we're going to lose his biological voice but on the other hand, it's a life saving operation. </p>

<p>'Without it, he would not survive another winter.' </p>

<p>And the morning of the operation, Francis is determined to be positive, telling Peter; "From tomorrow we can start planning a new chapter and put this behind us.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile the scientist also creates an avatar of himself in order to show his emotions in a way he won't be able to when he is fully locked in </p>

<p>And as he was wheeled into the operation, Peter says his last words aloud: 'I love you.'</p>

<p>The operation to re plumb peter's throat is a success, with Francis acknowledging: 'It's the biggest challenge that I've ever had to deal with and I think you've ever had to deal with as well, really. But I'm getting used to the silence and the quiet.</p>

<p>'That takes some doing after 40 years of Peter going a lot. We're in as good a place as we can be, given the situation.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile the moment of truth arrives with the technology he has been working towards since he was diagnosed arriving.</p>

<p>By the end of the programme, Peter is overwhelmed with the robot voice created for him and is left in tears when it sings for him and his family </p>

<p>He appeared overjoyed and overwhelmed when it arrived and hopes it will be a major break through in living with extreme disability, giving him and all others who are locked in a brighter future.</p>

<p>Using the new robotic voice, which he can control using his eyes, he says: 'It feels like I woke up on another planet.' </p>

<p>He continues: 'From the very beginning, Francis and I knew it would be a journey, not just for us.</p>

<p>"It is alright to feel scared, it comes with being human. We can fight our fears and progress will then accelerate. I am increasingly turning into a full cyborg. </p>

<p>'I will never stop being human but maybe I will help to change what it means to be human. It is a hugely exciting time to be alive. Now is not the end of anything, now is when the fun begins.' </p>

<p>Roboticist Peter Scott-Morgan has undergone many changes on his journey</p>

<p>Peter Scott-Morgan has undergone a complex journey to extend his life in the face of motor neurone disease. </p>
