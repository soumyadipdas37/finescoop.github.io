        <p>Andy Murray will finally return to Grand Slam singles action on Tuesday, and somewhere in his mind will be the thought of a surgeon who wrote him off.</p>

<p>Eighteen months on from his emotional - supposedly final - major appearance at the 2019 Australian Open, the 33-year-old Scot and his resurfaced hip will tackle Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka in the US Open first round.</p>

<p>Ahead of what promises be a gruelling baseline war, Murray revealed that a prime source of motivation in his fitness struggles has been an unnamed doctor, who offered him the view in 2017 that his career was probably over.</p>

<p>Andy Murray is using the words of a doctor who wrote him off as Grand Slam motivation</p>

<p>The 33-year-old will return to Grand Slam singles action against Yoshihito Nishioka (above)</p>

<p>‘There is one person in particular that helped me,’ he said. ‘It was the surgeon who told me after Wimbledon in 2017 that I didn’t have long left and I could have surgery - resurfacing or hip replacement - but I wouldn’t play professional sport again.</p>

<p>‘It was weird timing, I actually bumped into him the morning after I had the hip resurfacing (early last year) when I took my first steps with the crutches. I walked past him in the hallway and he smiled at me and said to my wife, “I told him he was going to have to do this”.</p>

<p>‘It just really got me. I was not happy. I would say that was the thing that gave me the biggest motivation because at that moment I had obviously been going through a difficult time, had the operation and I felt that there was a bit of smugness to what he told me.</p>

<p>An unnamed doctor had offered Murray the view in 2017 that his career was probably over</p>

<p>‘That was kind of enough for me. And I was actually going to send him a bottle of wine to say thanks for the motivation once I had got back on the court competing again, but I haven’t brought myself to do that yet.’</p>

<p>Any long-time observer of this extraordinary athlete will know that perceived slights have always been a powerful fuel. But usually it is someone in the media putting the pump in the tank, not a member of the medical profession.</p>

<p>Murray has surprised himself that he is back in the big time, although his remarkable triumph in last October’s European Open final in Antwerp should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>That was only the precursor to more problems, connected to his pelvis, but now he is back where he won his first Grand Slam title eight years ago.</p>

<p>His superb triumph in last October’s European Open final in Antwerp should not be overlooked</p>

<p>He admits that the undulating, science-defying journey has had more lows than highs.</p>

<p>‘The worst part was when I was lying to people or not being totally honest - because of the nature of sport I didn’t want to say,’ reflected Murray.</p>

<p>‘That is why in Australia (in January 2019) I was very upset because it was the first time I had spoken openly about it, but I had been struggling for a long time and trying to put a brave face on it.’</p>

<p>The surgery that followed went so well that by late June he was back playing - and winning - in doubles.</p>

<p>Murray admitted that the science-defying journey behind his return has more lows than highs</p>

<p>‘With each month that passed, I started to believe,’ he said. ‘I was a bit p***** off I wasn’t allowed to play singles at Wimbledon last year because actually I was feeling good physically in terms of having no pain.</p>

<p>‘But I didn’t really know until I started playing practice sets post- Wimbledon and beat a few guys in practice in Washington DC. I was like, “OK, I think I am going to be all right here”. It was probably not until I got back on the tour and played guys in singles that I actually really believed it.</p>

<p>‘That was probably a good four or five months later. I couldn’t speak to anyone, except really Bob Bryan (who had the same thing), about their experiences of it.’</p>

<p>Murray is unsure what will be easier for him - the Grand Slam format of potential five-setters with a day off in between, or events like Antwerp where it is best-of-three, but playing on consecutive days.</p>

<p>The Scot is now back and playing in the tournament where he won his first Grand Slam title</p>

<p>‘In Antwerp I played five matches in five days. From memory I actually felt all right after that. So I don’t really know. Last week was tough the day after the match with (Alex) Zverev, but these were also the first matches I had played in 10 months.</p>

<p>‘My body will learn fast. It has been playing tennis matches its whole life. I think it will adjust to what it is required to do. It might just take a bit of time because it has not done it for a while.’</p>

<p>The reality is that his combination of outstanding speed and stamina is not quite as it was, so expectations should be tempered. Nishioka, a relentless and consistent baseliner, will not be easy.</p>

<p>Play on Monday begins at 4pm UK time, with British men’s No 3 Cam Norrie in action against the ninth seed Diego Schwartzman from Argentina. Live on Amazon Prime.</p>
