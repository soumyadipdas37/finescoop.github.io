        <p>Giuliana Rancic revealed her entire family had contracted COVID-19 on Sunday when the veteran E! News host announced she would not be able to attend the Emmys.</p>

<p>And now her husband Bill Rancic is commending the breast cancer survivor, 46, for her strength, stopping by The Doctors to update everyone on their condition.</p>

<p>Bill, 49, was happy to report that Giuliana's symptoms were less severe than his own, telling Dr. Ian Smith: 'She’s strong as a bull — so knock on wood thank god that everything is okay.'</p>

<p>One tough cookie: Giuliana Rancic's husband Bill commended the E! Host/breast cancer survivor for her strength after news their entire family had contracted COVID-19. She's seen at January's Golden Globes above</p>

<p>As for his own health, the restaurateur said: 'I had some respiratory symptoms and a little bit of body aches,' according to a preview seen by People.</p>

<p>Bill was surprised to learn their family of three had come down with the disease, noting that they had been carefully quarantining in Idaho since March.</p>

<p>'Shockingly me, Giuliana and our son Duke, we all tested positive, needless to say we were rather shocked because we were all so cautious wiping every package down. We didn't travel on airplanes,' he explained.  </p>

<p>Though they had been taking every precaution Bill decided to get tested after a pal in their in their quarantine 'pod' contracted the virus.</p>

<p>Giuliana's husband of 13-years first dismissed his respiratory symptoms as just irritation from smoke in their area, before learning he and his family were sick. </p>

<p>Tough: Bill, 49, was happy to report that Giuliana's symptoms were less severe than his own, telling The Doctors: 'She’s strong as a bull — so knock on wood thank god that everything is okay'</p>

<p>No joke: Bill stressed the gravity of the virus, telling The Doctors: 'We got it while we were in seclusion which tells you anyone can get it ... this is not a joke'</p>

<p>Bill stressed the gravity of the virus, telling The Doctors: 'We got it while we were in seclusion which tells you anyone can get it ... this is not a joke.'  </p>

<p>Giuliana first revealed she and her entire family had contracted COVID-19 in a statement via E! on Sunday, sharing: 'Hey, everyone. As I go into my 20th year on the E! red carpet I have to say I do not take missing an award show lightly, but unfortunately this year is just so different.'</p>

<p>'As part of E! and NBCUniversal's very strict testing guidelines, especially before an event like this, I did find out that I tested positive for COVID-19.'</p>

<p>Serious stuff: Giuliana revealed she and her family had contracted COVID-19 in a statement via E! on Sunday, sharing: 'Hey, everyone. As I go into my 20th year on the E! red carpet I have to say I do not take missing an award show lightly, but unfortunately this year is just so different.' She's seen during the 2019 People's Choice Awards with the Kardashians above</p>

<p>Hi friends 💕⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ I shared this video on E! earlier today to explain why I was going to be missing our Emmy show.⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣ As I prepared to fly to LA to host E!s Emmy coverage, I discovered that I, along with my husband Bill and our son Duke, tested positive for Covid-19. As you may know, the health of those around me is always my first priority. We are all three doing well and are isolating at home and taking very good care of one another. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ We aren’t the first to get this news and we certainly won’t be the last so please continue to follow the safety guidelines to protect yourselves and those around you the best you can. We are all in this together. ❤️⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ Thank you so much to those of you who have been wishing us well. Please know we are sending you all lots of love from the three of us. ⁣ ⁣ Take good care ❤️ G, B &amp; D</p>

<p>A post shared by  Giuliana Rancic (@giulianarancic) on Sep 20, 2020 at 7:08pm PDT</p>

<p>'Now as much as I didn't want to hear that, I'm very thankful I heard it before I traveled and possibly could have exposed other people. So for that, I'm thankful.'     </p>

<p>'As far as my health, I'm doing well. My husband and our son also did test positive, but we're all doing well and taking care each other so I'm going to get back to doing that.'</p>

<p>She signed off, 'I just want to say I'm wishing you all the best and please protect yourselves and protect those around you. Take good care and I'll see you on the next red carpet.'</p>

<p>Unlucky: At the same time, co-host Vivica A. Fox also revealed she had tested positive for COVID-19, forcing her to skip the show as well. She's seen in February above</p>

<p>At the same time, co-host Vivica A. Fox also revealed she had tested positive for COVID-19, forcing her to skip the show as well.</p>

<p>But it turns out Vivica's first test, which she administered to herself at home, was actually a false positive.</p>

<p>After getting a second test from a medical professional, Fox discovered she was COVID-free.</p>

<p>Vivica explained in a statement shared to social media on Tuesday, saying: 'On Friday I took a self administered COVID-19 test and as many of you are aware, it came back positive.</p>

<p>The details: Vivica explained what happened in a statement shared to social media on Tuesday, also stressing the importance of relying on healthcare professionals for proper testing</p>

<p>'Two days ago I took another COVID test, this one administered by a medical professional, and I am thrilled to announce that last night my results came back NEGATIVE!'</p>

<p>Fox thanked everyone for their well-wishes, saying: 'I am feeling great and I want to thank everyone for their show of love and support.' </p>

<p>She also stressed the importance of relying on 'medical professionals' and not DIY test in her caption.</p>

<p>'GM Dawlings! Got a 2nd opinion, was tested by a MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL this time. I'm THRILLED to announce my Covid-19 test results are NEGATIVE! #Lifeisgood #GodIsGood.'</p>
