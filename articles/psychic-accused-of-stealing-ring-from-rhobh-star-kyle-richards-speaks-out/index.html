    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>A woman who was accused of stealing a ring from Kyle Richards has broken her silence to demand an apology from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star and Diane Keaton, whose Instagram photo sparked the theft allegations.  </p>

<p>Diana French, a retired pharmacy clerk from Los Angeles, spoke out on Monday about the bizarre saga which began last week when Richards shared her shock at seeing what she thought was her stolen ring on the finger of a woman whose hands had been photographed by Keaton in July 2019. </p>

<p>Keaton identified the woman in her photo as a 'psychic' from Santa Monica, prompting Richards to hire a private investigator to track her down the ring that was taken from her in a $1million jewelry heist at her California mansion in 2017. </p>

<p>The story took a turn when a TikTok user named Maddie came forward last Thursday and said the woman in the photo was her grandmother, French. </p>

<p>In a video for Inside Edition, French confirmed that she is not a fortune teller, and that Keaton snapped the photo while she was on shift at her pharmacy.  </p>

<p>'That picture of my hands was taken on the counter of the pharmacy,' French said, though she couldn't recall the specific date that she crossed paths with Keaton.  </p>

<p>She said she believes she is owed an apology from Richards and Keaton for causing her to be falsely accused of theft, saying: 'I mean, this is terrible. I don't deserve this.'</p>

<p>Scroll down for video </p>

<p>Diana French, a retired pharmacy clerk from Los Angeles, broke her silence for the first time since she was accused of stealing a ring from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kyle Richards in an interview with Inside Edition (pictured) released on Monday </p>

<p>French was thrust into Richards' search for her stolen ring after she was identified as the woman whose hands were featured in an Instagram photo posted by Keaton in July 2019 (pictured). In the caption Keaton said the woman was a psychic, but French says that the actress took the photo when she was working at a pharmacy </p>

<p>French's granddaughter Maddie revealed that her grandmother was the woman in the photo in a TikTok (pictured) last Thursday and insisted that the ring had been in her family for decades</p>

<p>French demanded an apology from both Richards (left) and Keaton (right) for causing her to be falsely accused of theft, telling Inside Edition: 'I don't deserve this'</p>

<p>French said she learned that she had been dragged into Richards' bizarre search for the stolen ring when her twin sister called her and said: 'Diana, you're on Google.'</p>

<p>She explained that the ring has been in her family for decades, so there's no way it ever belonged to Richards. </p>

<p>'My mother was killed 40 years ago and my dad gave me her band,' French said, noting that she has a trove of family photos showing her wearing the ring over the years, as well as appraisal papers from 1980 that set the ring's value at $2,500. </p>

<p>French added that she's also worn the striking long black nails seen in Keaton's photo for years, saying: 'I am totally lost without them.'</p>

<p>Reps for Richards and Keaton did not immediately return requests for comment on French's account. </p>

<p>French proudly wore her ring during the Inside Edition interview as she explained that her father gave it to her after her mother died 40 years ago</p>

<p>The grandmother offered up appraisal papers from 1980 that set the ring's value at $2,500</p>

<p>French also showed this old family photo which shows her wearing the ring in question</p>

<p>French's granddaughter Maddie defended her grandmother in a TikTok video late Thursday night, explaining that she came across the image of her grandmother's hands on Keaton's Instagram Stories - and was shocked to learn of the eccentric story behind it. </p>

<p>'I just want to clear things up,' she said, while pointing at a screengrab of Keaton's post - which Richards' believed showed a psychic wearing her mother's stolen ring. </p>

<p>'This ring right there, that's my grandma's ring. She has been working in a pharmacy for over 50 years [and] has had those rings for decades.' </p>

<p>Maddie then proceeded to share other images of her grandmother's hands to prove that she is actually the woman in Keaton's photograph.</p>

<p>'These are my grandma's hands at my fifth-grade graduation, and there's the ring you've been talking about,' the TikTok user said. </p>

<p>In the images, a pair of hands can be seen wearing the same chunky accessories that were pictured on the woman in Keaton's Instagram post, and the woman in Maddie's photos is also modeling the same long black nails that first prompted the actress to take her picture in the first place. </p>

<p>Maddie tagged Richards in her video caption, and told her to get in touch if she 'wants any more info' - while also adding the hashtag #notafortuneteller for good measure. </p>

<p>It is unclear exactly how Keaton came to believe that the woman she photographed last year was a 'fortune teller' as she wrote in her post.  </p>

<p>French's granddaughter Maddie defended her grandmother in a TikTok video late Thursday night, explaining that she came across the image of her grandmother's hands on Keaton's Instagram Stories - and was shocked to learn of the eccentric story behind it </p>

<p>In her TikTok video shared this photo of her grandmother's hands, which appear to feature the same ring - and the same unique black nails that appeared in the original photo</p>

<p>Maddie's video comes just hours after Richards offered what she thought was new evidence in her desperate hunt for her mother's stolen ring - an image of the bauble in her collection before it was robbed - which she used to try and prove it is the same design she spotted on the hand of the woman in Keaton's snap.  </p>

<p>Richards made the claim during a Secrets Revealed special for the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and shortly after took to Instagram to shed further light on the 'crazy story' by sharing an image of the beloved heirloom in her jewelry box and comparing it to the bauble that was photographed by Keaton. </p>

<p>'I got a lot of questions about the Secrets Revealed episode last night and the story about my mom's ring being stolen and my seeing the stolen ring on Diane Keaton's Instagram,' Richards explained in an Instagram Stories video.</p>

<p>'It is such a crazy story but I will post the picture that Diane posted and a picture of my mom's ring.'  </p>

<p>Richards then shared a screengrab of the image originally posted by Keaton, 74, which captures the hands of a Santa Monica psychic who is seen wearing multiple rings and bracelets - while also showing off long black fingernails. </p>

<p>The reality star zoomed in on the ring in question - which is on the woman's pinky finger - before posting a photo of what she believes to be the same design sitting in her jewelry drawer at home before it was stolen in the devastating robbery. </p>

<p>'My mom's ring in my drawer,' she captioned the personal picture. 'I took this picture the night before I was burglarized. I thought to myself, "If I ever was burglarized how would I remember exactly what I have?"</p>

<p>'So I took a photo in case that ever happened. Talk about manifesting.' </p>

<p>To offer further proof that the two rings are in fact the same, Richards then posted a side-by-side comparison of the two photos, while pointing out that 'you can see the gold is rubbed off in the exact spot' and revealing that the gold-and-diamond accessory was actually given to her mother Kathleen by her father Ken.  </p>

<p>Richards, 51, sparked interest and intrigue on last Thursday when she claimed that she had spotted her stolen ring in an Instagram photo shared by Keaton  </p>

<p>The RHOBH star shared these side-by-side comparison photos of the ring in Keaton's image (left) and her stolen heirloom (right) to try and prove that they are one and the same </p>

<p>Richards said the ring had been given to her mother Kathleen by her dad, and claimed the ring in Keaton's photo had gold 'rubbed off' in the same spot </p>

<p>Richards shared a wider shot of her jewelry collection and pointed out the stolen ring, which was taken when her California home was burglarized in late 2017</p>

<p>The mother-of-three revealed that she took the picture of her jewelry store the night before she was burglarized because she wanted to 'remember exactly what she had'</p>

<p>Richards' update on the fascinating saga came just hours after the entire story was laid bare in a teaser clip from the latest episode of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, which aired on Bravo on Thursday night. </p>

<p>In the Secrets Revealed special, Richards recalled her shock at spotting the ring in a random Instagram snap that was posted by Keaton - who later told the RHOBH star that she had only taken the photo because she was fascinated by the unnamed fortune teller's long black nails. </p>

<p>Richards reached out to Keaton, 74, after seeing her picture, however the actress was unable to offer additional information about the woman in the image</p>

<p>'I was looking on Instagram and I saw Diane Keaton - she posted a picture of a psychic's hands on the Third Street Promenade and [she] had my ring on her hand,' Richards explained in the new RHOBH special.</p>

<p>The Bravo-lebrity initially reached out to Keaton through her husband's real estate company, The Agency. </p>

<p>'We reached out to one of our agents at The Agency who happens to represent Diane Keaton, and I said, "You need to find out what the situation is."' </p>

<p>The agent in question spoke to Keaton, however she was unable to offer any more information. </p>

<p>According to Richards, Keaton explained to the agent that she didn't have any specific details about the woman - revealing that she had only stopped to take the picture of the unnamed woman's hands because she thought her long black nails were 'so interesting'. </p>

<p>The ring in question originally belonged to Richards' mother Kathleen, who left the jewel to her daughter along with several other family heirlooms after her death in 2002. It was then stolen from the $8.2 million Encino home that Richards shares with her husband Mauricio Umansky. </p>

<p>Richards lost dozens of sentimental family pieces in the robbery, and while police were investigating the crime, none of them had been found - until the reality star saw what she believes is her missing ring in the snap shared by Keaton.  </p>

<p>Richards first shared the story during a special episode of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, which aired on Thursday night </p>

<p>Hint: One Instagram user suggested that the woman in question might be a psychic known by the name of Lady Luna</p>

<p>After the episode of Real Housewives aired, several fans took to Instagram to share their own thoughts about who the woman might be - with one user suggesting that the woman could be a psychic known as Lady Luna, who operates in the Santa Monica area. </p>

<p>'The psychic that has your ring is named Lady Luna in Santa Monica...' user @hellakella3838 wrote on their account. </p>

<p>'I found others who went to same psychic and they verified its her nails... She doesn't have an IG though unfortunately... But maybe u can find her location with the name ...IF U want names of ppl who i found lmk [sic].'</p>

<p>A Bravo fan account also launched an appeal for followers to help Richards track down the woman and the ring - while also urging people not to 'accuse' the fortune teller of anything untoward, noting that the woman may well have paid good money for the ring, or been given it, without knowing where it came from.</p>

<p>'Internet detectives, do your best!' the @bravosuperfans account wrote. 'Find the Santa Monica Fortune Teller! What are the chances that Kyle would see this random photo, with her stolen mom’s ring! Serendipity. </p>

<p>'ALSO - let's not accuse the fortune teller. Someone could have given the ring for payment.'</p>

<p>Before launching her social media search, Richards had already spent a great deal of time and resources investigating the mystery on her own.  </p>

<p>Important: The ring in question belonged to Richards' mother, Kathleen, and was one of many heirlooms stolen in the $1 million heist. Richards is seen with her mom and sister Kim in 1983</p>

<p>Crime scene: The ring was stolen from the stunning Encino home that Richards shares with her husband Mauricio Umansky (pictured), which was burglarized while they were in Aspen  </p>

<p>Family: Richards and Umansky bought the property for $8.2 million just months before the robbery, and the RHOBH star admitted that she was tempted to move after it happened </p>

<p>While Keaton was unable to offer any specific information about the woman - other than her location - Richards was determined not to let the lead go to waste, and she quickly enlisted a private investigator to try and track down the photo subject.  </p>

<p>When the private investigator failed to find the woman, Richards took matters into her own hands and teamed up with her RHOBH co-star and close friend Teddi Mellencamp to try and locate her. </p>

<p>Their efforts proved fruitless however, with Mellencamp explaining in the RHOBH special: 'We thought we were hot on the trail but then we realized we were just being sent in circles.' </p>

<p>At that point, Richards had to give up the search in order to focus on filming for the latest season of the hit Bravo show, however she explained in the new episode that she is determined to resume the hunt and track down her stolen heirloom. </p>

<p>'I want to know if she bought that from someone at a pawn shop, even if I have to buy it back from her, I'm happy to do that,' she said.  </p>

<p>Richards' reignited search for her mother's stolen ring comes three years after the bauble was first stolen from the reality star's home along with dozens of other valuables and sentimental items worth a staggering $1 million. </p>

<p>The mother-of-four and her realtor husband were holidaying in Aspen when thieves broke into her Encino home, which the couple had purchased for $8.2 million just a few months prior. </p>

<p>Buddies: After a failed attempt to locate the fortune-teller with a private investigator, Richards teamed up with her RHOBH co-star Teddi Mellencamp (right) to find the fortune teller</p>

<p>Richards had planned to give the majority of the heirlooms that were stolen to her four daughters, Farrah, Portia, Alexia, and Sophia</p>

<p>Speaking about the devastating robbery in January 2018, Richards revealed that many of the items stolen during the heist were priceless family heirlooms that she had hoped to one day bequeath to her daughters, Farrah, Portia, Alexia, and Sophia, who were in Aspen with their parents when their home was burglarized. </p>

<p>The home robbery was so traumatic Richards actually considered moving out of the Encino property, she confessed to Bravo in 2018.</p>

<p>'There was one point after our house was burglarized that I thought, you know, I might have to sell my house - but then I look at my dogs and see how much they love this house and I think, "I could never leave,"' she explained.</p>

<p>In her first interview after the robbery, Richards told People that 'everything my mother, who passed away, had ever collected and saved to give to me - that I had always envisioned of passing on to my four daughters - was gone'. </p>

<p>She added: 'Even my children’s baby bracelets. Obviously, those are the things that hurt the most, things that I can't replace. They're completely invaluable.'</p>

<p>In a different People interview she shared that despite being one of three sisters she inherited 'the majority' of her mother's keepsakes when she passed away in March 2002.</p>

<p>As a result, when these valuables were stolen 'there was guilt attached to it. They got taken from me, from my house, on my watch'.  </p>
