        <p>Brandi Glanville has claimed that she got supportive messages from Heather Locklear amid her feud with Denise Richards.</p>

<p>However she alleged that Heather is unwilling to discuss the actress on TV because Denise purportedly once sent her a cease and desist.</p>

<p>Appearing on Wednesday night's episode of Watch What Happens Live, Brandi, 47, told her story to Real Housewives producer Andy Cohen.</p>

<p>Sharing her side: Brandi Glanville has claimed that she got supportive messages from Heather Locklear amid her feud with Denise Richards</p>

<p>Although Brandi's interview aired Wednesday hours after Denise's rep told Variety she was quitting the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, it was taped the day before. </p>

<p>The current Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills season has been roiled by drama involving Brandi's claim that Denise had an extramarital affair with her last April.</p>

<p>Denise celebrated her second wedding anniversary with Aaron Phypers this week and has consistently denied that the affair with Brandi ever took place.</p>

<p>'So Heather just reached out to me and said: "Thank you," with a bunch of hearts and prayers. And I was like, it just made me feel like I was probably bringing this side of Denise out for everyone to see. And I wrote back: "Of course. The truth always comes out." And she wrote a bunch of more hearts,' Brandi told Andy.</p>

<p>Allegations: Brandi claimed Heather declined to discuss the matter on Watch What Happens Live because she 'had a cease and desist from Denise....'; Heather is pictured in 2013</p>

<p>Her side: Denise's departure from RHOBH went public hours before part two of the three-part season 10 reunion aired where she said Brandi was 'not a friend of mine'</p>

<p>'And then I said: "Hey, you should be on Watch What Happens Live with me," and she said: "I've already had a cease and desist from Denise so I'm not gonna do it."'</p>

<p>Denise reportedly sent a cease and desist to Bravo to get the network to stop broadcasting material about Brandi's affair allegation.</p>

<p>She is also claimed to have sent similar cease and desists to co-stars as well as to Evolution, the production company behind the show, Page SIx reports. </p>

<p>Months ago Brandi also wrote on Instagram that Denise 'sent me a cease-and-desist [so] I will not talk about her.' </p>

<p>The man himself: Appearing on Wednesday night's episode of Watch What Happens Live , Brandi, 47, told her story to Real Housewives producer Andy Cohen </p>

<p>Heather and Denise used to be close pals but their friendship broke apart in the late 2000s as their respective marriages collapsed.</p>

<p>Denise divorced Heather's former Spin City co-star Charlie Sheen in 2006. In the months following her filing Denise took up with Bon Jovi's Richie Sambora.</p>

<p>Richie used to be married to Heather, who filed in February 2006 for a divorce that was ultimately finalized in April 2007.</p>

<p>There was speculation that Denise tore Richie away from her friend but she denied this version of events to Redbook in 2008. </p>

<p>The way they were: Heather and Denise used to be close pals but their friendship broke apart in the late 2000s as their respective marriages collapsed; pictured on New Year's Day 2006</p>

<p>'I was no longer friends with Heather months before Richie and I got together. I don't want to say what caused the split, but she and I weren't even speaking then' she said.</p>

<p>'It wasn't ever like we'd be shopping and go back to her house and I'd flirt with her husband. Yes, I got together with Heather's soon-to-be ex-husband, but no, I didn't have an affair with him. If Heather and I had been friends at that time, I would never have crossed that line. But we weren't,' Denise insisted.</p>

<p>'The friendship was not salvageable, and in the beginning Richie and I just talked as friends because we were dealing with similar situations. We never planned for anything to happen,' she said. </p>

<p>'Did I question the decision? Yes. Did I know it wouldn't go over well? Of course. I'm a grown woman and I know what I did and the repercussions of it. I get why the public thinks I'm an awful person who stole someone's husband,' Denise confessed. </p>

<p>Remember when: Denise (center) is pictured guest-starring Spin City starring Heather (right) and Charlie Sheen (left) in 2001; Denise was married to Charlie from 2002-2006</p>

<p>Acting: Heather and Denise even shared an on-screen kiss on Spin City</p>

<p>'But in my heart, I know I did not break up their marriage. If either Richie or I had felt our marriages were fixable, we wouldn't have crossed that line.'</p>

<p>Denise's departure announcement from The Real Housewives OF Beverly Hills came the day that the second part of the three-part pre-taped season 10 reunion aired.</p>

<p>'The word of the night is calculated #timing #Are you f***ing kidding me,' Brandi tweeted Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Denise said on Wednesday's reunion episode that Brandi was 'not a friend of mine,' but on that night's episode of Watch What Happens Live Brandi said: 'We were definitely friends and more than friends actually.' </p>

<p>'Calculated #timing': Not only are the Real Housewives reunion episodes pre-taped, but apparently Brandi's Watch What Happens Live shot was filmed a day before its air-date as well</p>

<p>Ciao: Beverly Hills Housewife Erika Jayne, whom Denise has clashed with on the show, appeared to take an online dig at her after her exit made headlines</p>

<p>Beverly Hills Housewife Erika Jayne, whom Denise has clashed with on the show, appeared to take an online dig at her after her exit made headlines.</p>

<p>Erika tweeted a Small Wonder GIF of a door slam along with the word: 'Bye' and a waving hand emoji. </p>

<p>Denise became a Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills in 2018 just three years after Brandi left the reality series after three seasons in the main cast. </p>

<p>On the current season, at a group dinner in Rome, Denise blew up at her fellow Housewives whom she felt had relentlessly 'interrogated' her about Brandi's claim.</p>

<p>Star turn: Denise became a Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills in 2018 just three years after Brandi left the reality series after three seasons in the main cast</p>

<p>The meal deteriorated into a massive row where Denise slammed her co-stars as 'mean girls' and fled the table before a producer convinced her to come back.</p>

<p>This February she responded to an Instagram comment claiming she had an 'open marriage' and insisted that she is '100% monogamous to my husband.'</p>

<p>Last year the onetime Bond girl revealed that both she and Aaron got happy ending massages at her suggestion during their romance.</p>

<p>The ladies themselves: On the current season, at a group dinner in Rome, Denise blew up at her fellow Housewives whom she felt had relentlessly 'interrogated' her about Brandi's claim </p>

<p>'If I was just doing it to make a splash, why would I not have done it last season? Then they would have brought me back full-time this season because they would have had a giant full f**king story line,' Brandi said in July of her allegations. </p>

<p>She asserted to Us Weekly: 'I didn’t say it last season because I was worried that I was a cheater after she’s like: "Oh, Aaron’s going to kill me if he finds out." I thought: "What is she talking about?" That is bulls***."'</p>

<p>'I didn't say it last season because I was worried that I was a cheater after she's like: "Oh, Aaron's going to kill me if he finds out."'</p>

<p>The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills rose to be the 'top-rated cable program on Wednesday nights' amid this storyline, according to Variety. </p>

<p>Look of love: Denise celebrated her second wedding anniversary with Aaron Phypers this week and has consistently denied that the affair with Brandi ever took place</p>
