        <p>Mickey Rourke shocked viewers of The Masked Singer on Wednesday when he voluntarily pulled off his Gremlin mask and eliminated himself from the show.</p>

<p>It was the first time in the program's history a contestant has ever unmasked before the voting round at the end and no one knew what to do.</p>

<p>Moments earlier, the 68-year-old star of The Wrestler had sung Ben E. King's Stand By Me as the Gremlin, a purple beast with shaggy fur.</p>

<p>TV history: Mickey Rourke shocked viewers of The Masked Singer on Wednesday when he voluntarily pulled off his Gremlin mask and eliminated himself from the show</p>

<p>His spacy, off-tempo delivery had panelist Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, 47, asking fellow panelist Robin Thicke, 43, 'Is he like 100 years old?'</p>

<p>When the actor finished, he waited three minutes before deciding it was too hot to stay in costume, and he was over it anyway.</p>

<p>'I wanna take this off right now,' Mickey informed show host Nick Cannon, 39, pulling wildly at his mask as everyone nearby begged him to stop.</p>

<p>'Gremlin, you can't do that!' Nick insisted. 'It's not that part of the show yet!'</p>

<p>First time: It was the first time in the program's history a contestant has ever unmasked before the voting round at the end and no one knew what to do</p>

<p>Gremlin costume: The 68-year-old star of The Wrestler had sung Ben E. King's Stand By Me as the Gremlin, a purple beast with shaggy fur</p>

<p>The panelists stood up at their table, imploring him to wait, as Nicole Scherzinger, 42, yelled, 'But we haven't even voted!' and Jenny shouted, 'What is happening?'</p>

<p>Nick called the show's Men in Black for help, saying, 'We've lost control! It's the Gremlin's show!'</p>

<p>With that, Mickey finally yanked off his mask and whipped it into the studio's seats, grinning.</p>

<p>Lost control: Show host Nick Cannon called the show's Men in Black for help, saying, 'We've lost control! It's the Gremlin's show!'</p>

<p>No vote: Mickey said he was hot and wanted to take off his mask</p>

<p>Sly grin: Mickey finally yanked off his mask and whipped it into the studio's seats, grinning</p>

<p>'Oh my God! I can't believe it!' screamed Jenny, the only panelist to have guessed it was him.</p>

<p>Mickey grinned, and the mark of a woman's lipsticked kiss could be seen on his cheek.</p>

<p>'Man, you're such a legend,' Nick told the 9½ Weeks star. 'What would make you do The Masked Singer?'</p>

<p>Total chaos: Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong and Nicole Scherzinger went wild during the chaotic ending</p>

<p>Correct guess: 'Oh my God! I can't believe it!' screamed Jenny, the only panelist to have guessed that Gremlin was Mickey</p>

<p>'I was in the neighborhood,' Mickey cracked. 'I do like the show. I've watched like, four episodes. When they asked, ''Would you be interested?'' So I watched from the very beginning and all that s***, you know.'</p>

<p>Mickey's performance garnered at least one rave, from Nicole, who said, 'I loved his voice. It had so many layers, and it was like, all the texture in it. It was yummy! That's some seasoning!'</p>

<p>The Barfly star had initially started to walk offstage during the applause after his song, leading Nick to joke, 'I don't know where The Gremlin's going, but keep it going for him!'</p>

<p>Loved it: Mickey's performance garnered at least one rave, from Nicole, who said, 'I loved his voice. It had so many layers, and it was like, all the texture in it. It was yummy! That's some seasoning!'</p>

<p>Barfly star: The Barfly star earlier shared clues referencing his former boxing career and the film Rumble Fish</p>

<p>Mickey returned to explain that he'd sung the song because it had also been performed by one of his best friends, the late Willy DeVille, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2009.</p>

<p>'I've missed him for a long, long time,' Mickey said, growing emotional. 'And I think the other night for some reason, Willy sent me down this song.'</p>

<p>In The Gremlin's pre-taped video, Mickey said, 'You may have heard I can be a bit combative, but I have a fluffy side, too. I adore all animals, long spins on the beach, a little feng shui, and bashing worthy opponents with foreign objects for maximum impact. I also love to cook! If you like what you see, I'd love to have you for dinner. I mean, have you over for dinner.'</p>

<p>Late friend: Willy DeVille, shown in 1993, was friends with Mickey and the actor said his late friend inspired his performance on the Fox show</p>

<p>Swan song: The actor and Nick performed his song together</p>

<p>He was shown boxing with a shark, ironing a shirt, cutting carrots, and drinking 41 proof liquor.</p>

<p>It was ultimately revealed that the boxing shark referred to Mickey's past boxing career and his role in the 1983 film Rumble Fish, while the iron was a nod to his character Ivan Vanko in Iron Man 2, and the mention of liking to cook alluded to his pen name, Eddie Cook.</p>

<p>Jenny initially thought the fighting clues pointed to Rocky actor Sylvester Stallone, 74, before remembering audio she'd played of Mickey's voice on her radio show.</p>

<p>Fresh lipstick: Mickey had fresh red lipstick on his cheek after he unmasked</p>

<p>Robin thought The Gremlin was rocker Jerry Lee Lewis, 85, while panelist Ken Jeong, 51, felt it could be wrestler 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, 55.</p>

<p>When The Gremlin unmasked, Ken realized he was the Oscar nominee they'd all been told about at the top of the season, referring to Mickey's nod for 2009's The Wrestler.</p>

<p>Robin said he should have known it was Mickey, noting, 'We've hung out a few times together down in Miami,' as Mickey put his finger to his mouth and said, 'Shhhh.'</p>

<p>Wild guesses: Robin thought The Gremlin was rocker Jerry Lee Lewis, 85, while panelist Ken Jeong, 51, felt it could be wrestler 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, 55</p>

<p>The actor sang Stand By Me again with Nick and walked offstage with 14 seconds left.</p>

<p>The season four episode introduced viewers to the six singers in Group B, Mickey among them.</p>

<p>With his departure, no other singers would be going home this week.</p>

<p>Clock ticking: The actor sang Stand By Me again with Nick and walked offstage with 14 seconds left</p>

<p>Hawaiian shirt: Robin laughed while watching the unusual unmasking unfold</p>

<p>The Crocodile was first to perform, unveiling a rocking cover of Bon Jovi's It's My Life.</p>

<p>'The vocals, I was so impressed!' Nicole exclaimed. 'You did everything. And then you did choreography and you came out with your little pimp walk. I mean—that was crazy.'</p>

<p>In his video, Crocodile said, 'Ever since I was a kid, growing up in Hollywood, surrounded by heartache and instability, I was forced to develop a thick skin. Crocodiles get a bad reputation for being cold-blooded, when actually I'm a warm sensitive creature who just wants to be loved back.'</p>

<p>First up: The Crocodile was first to perform, unveiling a rocking cover of Bon Jovi's It's My Life</p>

<p>Visual clues included a Vegas hotel, Italian flag, old-style nightclub singer, balloons in the shape of a heart, water slide, restaurant table for two, and a fish in a pineapple.</p>

<p>The panelists guessed Crocodile was singer Nick Lachey, 46, or Donnie Wahlberg, 56, or actor Jon Hamm, 49.</p>

<p>Up next was Baby Alien, the show's first puppet character, who sang George Michael's Faith.</p>

<p>First impressions: The panelists guessed Crocodile was singer Nick Lachey, 46, or Donnie Wahlberg, 56, or actor Jon Hamm, 49</p>

<p>Cute baby: Up next was Baby Alien, the show's first puppet character, who sang George Michael's Faith</p>

<p>In his video, a teacher droned 'Baby Alien? Baby Alien?' a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as the alien prepared for school.</p>

<p>'It's time for my rebirth,' he said. 'I've been stuck in second gear for a while. Back when I was the cream of the crop circle, I was in the theater every week—and even beamed onto the Tony Award stage, baby. But before long, I became a second thought, lost in space.'</p>

<p>Clues included a cracked Liberty bell, red Corvette, parade float, roses, horseshoe, and a turtle in a karate gi with a black belt and spinning star.</p>

<p>Second thought: 'It's time for my rebirth,' Baby Alien said in its clues package. 'I've been stuck in second gear for a while. Back when I was the cream of the crop circle, I was in the theater every week—and even beamed onto the Tony Award stage, baby. But before long, I became a second thought, lost in space'</p>

<p>Asked why he'd come on the show, Baby Alien replied in an Eastern European accent: 'Big fan Pussycat Doll. Also big fan Jenny McCarthy. Had poster on wall as teenager.'</p>

<p>The panelists guessed he was an actor like Ralph Macchio, 58, David Schwimmer, 53, or Freddie Prinze, Jr., 44.</p>

<p>The panel was blown away. 'We might be looking at the winner of season 4 right now,' Nicole said.</p>

<p>In her Western-themed video, Seahorse drank tea by a campfire with two poodles, a rainbow-colored frog, and a pigeon. 'All my life, I've felt trapped by my insecurities and shyness,' she said. 'You may call me melodramatic, but at times I've felt lost in this world, like I was always swimming upstream. Here I get the chance to stop playing tug-of-war with myself, and finally expose the dauntless diva within.'</p>

<p>Clues included a thunderstorm, warty hog, gnarled tree, dolphins and other forms of ocean life.</p>

<p>Whatchamacallit's video found him sailing through the clouds and wading in orange Jello, whipped cream and sliced oranges.</p>

<p>'I'm magical, mythical, fit as a physical, jazzy and snazzy and full of pizzazzy,' he said. 'You see, people think I'm a shy guy, especially because I've let others absorb my spotlight. [But] I can dance with the stars, surf candy bars, buzz from the bees and swing from the keys.'</p>

<p>Clues included a rainbow, cane, golden key, black panther, and a mixed-up clock face that bore a '4.0,' record table, shrimp, pants, a pink and blue bear, and a triangle instrument.</p>

<p>'Sup friends?' Serpent asked in his video, sitting in a library with the book 'How to Dig Yourself Out of Debt.' 'It took a chain of miraculous events to get here, starting when I was young. Mischievous and devious, a trouble-making snakeling. I was slithering furiously down a path towards destruction. But my pops saved me, buying me a one-way ticket away from the wrong crowd and onto a path toward success… I didn't want to cause pain, but heal pain.'</p>

<p>Clues included a map of the Caribbean, luggage, a paper airplane on fire, a backwards baseball cap, and 'Serpent Sr.,' an older cobra sporting a mustache.</p>

<p>Guesses ranged from singer John Legend, 41, to Hamilton actors Daveed Diggs, 38, and Leslie Odom, Jr., 39.</p>

<p>The Gremlin was the last singer on the show, and no final vote would be needed.</p>
