        <p>Manchester City may have the most vast resources of anyone arguably in world football but despite all their riches they still can't solve their poor defensive issues.</p>

<p>City's backline flaws were on full display at home to Leicester City in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon as they were dismantled 5-2.</p>

<p>Benfica centre back Ruben Dias looks set to be the latest defensive recruitment to arrive to the Etihad after the Portuguese outfit confirmed on Sunday night that a £65million deal had been agreed with City. </p>

<p>Benfica centre back Ruben Dias is set to join Manchester City in a £65million transfer </p>

<p>The 23-year-old will become the 12th defensive signing made by Pep Guardiola while at City</p>

<p>The transfer will see Argentine centre back Nicolas Otamendi move in the opposite direction for £13.6m.</p>

<p>Dias', 23, arrival will see Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's spending go beyond £400m (£413.2m to be precise) on 12 defensive recruitments in what is his fifth campaign in charge of the club.</p>

<p>With such an eye-watering outlay on defenders alone, Sportsmail assesses how these have fared in the blue half of Manchester.</p>

<p>City boss Guardiola has seen his defenders give him plenty of headaches during his reign</p>

<p>Oleksandr Zinchenko - £1.7million (from FC Ufa)</p>

<p>Bought as an attacking midfielder, the Ukrainian has spent most of his football playing at left back under Guardiola. An able deputy there, ultimately he is still playing out of position at the Etihad.</p>

<p>However, with the array of attacking options in front of him, the 23-year-old's best chance of first-team action remains as a makeshift left back. Has won six major honours under Guardiola too.</p>

<p>Verdict: Jury's Out</p>

<p>Despite being a midfielder, Oleksandr Zinchenko continues to be played out of position at City</p>

<p>John Stones - £47.5m (from Everton)</p>

<p>Should be the cornerstone of the defence but as he begins his fifth season at City he is anything but and could find himself as the fifth-choice centre back when Dias arrives.</p>

<p>The ball-playing talent remains within Stones but high-profile mistakes and injuries have seen his confidence rocked. As a result he is no longer part of the England setup. For the fee and expectation, the 26-year-old has underwhelmed. It must be said though that time is on his side - it's going to be a make-or-break season for him.</p>

<p>Verdict: Miss </p>

<p>Money spent on defenders in 2016-17: £49.2m </p>

<p>Centre back John Stones (right) has fallen off tremendously in recent seasons at the Etihad</p>

<p>Kyle Walker - £54m (from Tottenham)</p>

<p>After one season in charge of City, Guardiola knew he had to address their deficiencies at full back - and the signing of Walker has proven a fine bit of business. The right back immediately transformed their fortunes and he played a pivotal role in their title victory that season.</p>

<p>Has had some wobbles during his time at the Etihad - and gave away a silly penalty for Leicester's equaliser on Sunday (to make it 1-1) - but the fact he still remains first-choice right back, despite Guardiola having signed others in his position, is tantamount to Walker's form.</p>

<p>Verdict: Hit</p>

<p>Kyle Walker (left) has been one of City's best signings in the Guardiola era - playing a key role</p>

<p>Danilo - £26.5m (from Real Madrid)</p>

<p>Bought as one of three full backs in the summer of 2017, Danilo never forced his way into Guardiola's first-team thinking on a regular basis. Walker and Benjamin Mendy were the Spaniard's first-choice full-back options but Danilo got his chance when injury befell the latter in 2017-18. </p>

<p>He played 23 matches in the Premier League that season but featured only 11 times the following campaign before he was sold to Juventus in part-exchange for Joao Cancelo.</p>

<p>Verdict: Miss</p>

<p>Danilo was bought the same summer as Walker but failed to dislodge him as City's right-back</p>

<p>Benjamin Mendy - £52m (from Monaco)</p>

<p>The France World Cup winner was an instant hit upon the blue half of Manchester when he joined from Ligue 1 outfit Monaco. The jovial character endeared himself to fans with his persona and performances on the pitch but it's the latter that has now seen him become the butt of some rival fans' jokes.</p>

<p>Injuries have played a major part in this - he has suffered two severe knee injuries while at City - but even now fully fit he clearly doesn't have the full confidence of Guardiola. The 26-year-old is error-prone - he gave away a ridiculous penalty to allow Leicester to make it 5-2 on Sunday - and can be got at defensively. These reasons are why the left-back berth remains a problem for City.</p>

<p>Verdict: Miss</p>

<p>Benjamin Mendy looked brilliant when he initially joined City but he has been anything since</p>

<p>Eric Garcia - £1.5m (from Barcelona)</p>

<p>Despite joining in 2017, initially in the academy, Garcia has only become part of Guardiola's permanent first-team plans since last season. The 19-year-old's displays at centre back have earned him international recognition too - winning his first Spain cap earlier this month as a substitute against Ukraine.</p>

<p>A player with a bright future, Garcia's rawness has seen him exposed at times but those rough edges to his game will get smoothed out with experience. However, the teenager has expressed his desire to leave City once his contract expires next summer - with a return to boyhood club Barcelona his likely destination.</p>

<p>Verdict: Jury's Out</p>

<p>This season is set to be Eric Garcia's last at City - with the defender refusing to sign a new deal</p>

<p>Aymeric Laporte (January 2018) - £57m (from Athletic Bilbao)</p>

<p>The one centre back Guardiola can truly rely upon - oh, how the City boss must wish club legend Vincent Kompany was playing alongside him. Laporte has the ball-playing qualities that defines a Guardiola team, while he is a solid defender too.</p>

<p>The one negative about the 26-year-old though is his injury record. He was only fit enough to make the bench against Leicester on Sunday - after overcoming coronavirus - and if City are to truly challenge Liverpool this season they need him to be the cornerstone of their defence throughout 2020-21.</p>

<p>Verdict: Hit</p>

<p>Money spent on defenders in 2017-18: £191m</p>

<p>Aymeric Laporte is without doubt City's best centre back - Guardiola has to keep him fully fit</p>

<p>Philippe Sandler - £2.7m (from PEC Zwolle)</p>

<p>Has only made one appearance for City and that came as a 67th-minute substitute in the 7-0 FA Cup third-round win over Rotherham United in January 2019 (and they were 4-0 up at this point).</p>

<p>Spent last season on at Belgian giants Anderlecht, under Kompany, so it would be unfair to judge him. However, the 23-year-old faces an uphill battle to break into the City team.</p>

<p>Verdict: Jury's out</p>

<p>Money spent: £2.7m</p>

<p>Money spent on defenders in 2018-19: £2.7m</p>

<p>Philippe Sandler (right) has only featured once for City since joining the club during 2018-19</p>

<p>Angelino - £5.3m (from PSV Eindhoven)</p>

<p>Bought back by City last summer, after being sold to PSV Eindhoven in 2018 - Angelino lasted just months before he was shipped out again. Initially it was on loan at German side RB Leipzig, where he helped them reach the Champions League semi-finals, before that deal was extended for the whole of 2020-21.</p>

<p>In the 12 games he did feature in before his move to Germany, Angelino wasn't the most convincing at left back to say the least. The fact Guardiola has let him go despite left back being a problem position says it all.</p>

<p>Verdict: Miss</p>

<p>Angelino was re-signed by City last season but is currently out on loan after failing to impress</p>

<p>Joao Cancelo - £60m (from Juventus)</p>

<p>The trouble the Portuguese has is that he has Walker in front of him as first-choice right back. Like Danilo, Cancelo can play at left back but that is not his natural position. It took him a while to bed in at the Etihad last season but he did go on to make 33 appearances in all competitions.</p>

<p>However, the 26-year-old does have a substantial transfer fee for a full back to justify. He may have to do so at the problem left-back berth for Guardiola this term. </p>

<p>Verdict: Jury's Out</p>

<p>Money spent on defenders in 2019-20: £65.3m  </p>

<p>Joao Cancelo faces the same problems that Danilo had in trying to usurp Walker at right back</p>

<p>Nathan Ake - £40m (from Bournemouth)</p>

<p>Verdict: Far too early to judge the Holland international as he is only two games into his fleeting City career. It's been a mixed bag so far - impressing on debut in the 3-1 win at Wolves, scoring against Leicester but also being part of a team that conceded five in that same match.</p>

<p>Money spent: Jury's Out</p>

<p>Money spent on defenders in 2020-21: £40m</p>

<p>Summer signing Nathan Ake (right) is very much still settling into his new surroundings at City</p>

<p>2016-17</p>

<p>Oleksandr Zinchenko - £1.7m (from FC Ufa)</p>

<p>John Stones - £47.5m (from Everton)</p>
