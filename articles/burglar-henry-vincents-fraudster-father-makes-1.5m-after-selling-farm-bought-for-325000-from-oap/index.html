        <p>The fraudster father of slain Hither Green burglar Henry Vincent has pocketed £1.5 million after selling a sprawling farm his wife bought for £325,000 from a vulnerable pensioner two years ago, MailOnline can reveal.</p>

<p>Rosemary Vincent, whose son was fatally stabbed by a homeowner in the botched 2018 raid, acquired the five-bedroom Grade II Snagbrook Farm and surrounding 61-acres of land in the picturesque Kent village of Hollingbourne that year. </p>

<p>The ramshackle property was sold yesterday at an online auction to a mystery buyer for £1.5 million. </p>

<p>Footage of the house and grounds showed empty rooms with holes in the floors and ceilings, while naked bulbs and Christmas tinsel were seen hanging from the walls. </p>

<p>The fraudster father of slain Hither Green burglar Henry Vincent has made £1.5 million after selling Snagbrook Farm (above) which his wife bought for £325,000 from a vulnerable pensioner two years ago, MailOnline can reveal </p>

<p>Rosemary Vincent, whose son was fatally stabbed by a homeowner in the botched 2018 raid, acquired the five-bedroom Grade II Snagbrook Farm and surrounding 61-acres of land in the picturesque Kent village of Hollingbourne that year. The ramshackle property which is derelict in parts was sold yesterday at an online auction to a mystery buyer for £1.5 million</p>

<p>Rosemary Vincent (right) bought the farm in a cut price deal from landowner Dudley Wright whom first met the family in 2016 when her handyman husband Henry (left) offered to do odd jobs around his home</p>

<p>The Vincents' son Henry, 37, (left) was living at Snagbrook Farm when he robbed the home of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks (right) in Hither Green two years ago. The burglar ended up being stabbed with his own screwdriver during a scuffle with the former RAC office manager, and died after staggering onto the pavement</p>

<p>Mrs Vincent bought the farm in a cut price deal from landowner Dudley Wright who first met the family in 2016 when her handyman husband Henry offered to do odd jobs around his home. </p>

<p>It is understood the Vincents moved in while Mr Wright ended up living in a ramshackle caravan on a patch of land next to the house and he has not been seen since.  </p>

<p>Two years after meeting the couple, the 74-year-old farmer agreed to sell his property to Mrs Vincent in five separate plots, with each costing £65,000. </p>

<p>The following year she then transferred the property to her husband's name. </p>

<p>Yesterday's £1.5 million sale prompted anger among locals who know Mr Wright and accused the Vincents of taking advantage of a vulnerable old man.</p>

<p>It is understood the Vincents moved in while Mr Wright (above) ended up living in a ramshackle caravan on a patch of land next to the house and he has not been seen since</p>

<p>Chris, who ran the local village shop, said: 'The whole thing is a disgrace and should be properly investigated.</p>

<p>'A pensioner was taken advantage of and these people have made a hefty profit in a very short period of time. It all smells very rotten to me.'</p>

<p>The Vincents' son Henry, 37, was living at Snagbrook Farm when he robbed the home of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks in Hither Green two years ago.</p>

<p>The burglar ended up being stabbed with his own screwdriver during a scuffle with the former RAC office manager, and died after staggering onto the pavement.  </p>

<p>Mr Osborn-Brooks was initially arrested on suspicion of murder before being cleared of any wrong-doing, but the death prompted an outpouring of protest from the traveller community, to which the Vincents belong.</p>

<p>Numerous threats were made against Mr Osborn-Brooks and his wife who were forced to sell their three-bedroom home and move elsewhere. </p>

<p>At Snagbrook Farm today, the property appeared abandoned, with a padlock slung over the gate and the driveway overgrown and in a shabby state. </p>

<p>Its sudden sale sparked fresh concerns about Mr Wright and what has happened to him. </p>

<p>One local said: 'We haven't got a clue where Dudley is and it's a mystery that's got us all talking. He was always a bit of a recluse and didn't really have any friends in the village so I just hope he's OK.'</p>

<p>In 2018, MailOnline revealed that soon after the Vincents took ownership of the farm, Mr Wright wrote to his ex-wife saying their daughter Davinia was being written out of his will.</p>

<p>His cattle were then sold and a long-serving farm worker, Walter Bratton, who had lived in a house in the grounds, was duly removed and lost his job.</p>

<p> Two years after meeting the couple, the 74-year-old farmer agreed to sell his property to Mrs Vincent in five separate plots, with each costing £65,000. The following year she then transferred the property to her husband's name</p>

<p>Snagbrook Farm was put up for sale this week by Clive Emson auctioneers with a £1.5 million guide price, sparking three days of intense online interest</p>

<p>Mr Wright's ex-wife Winnifred, whom he married in 1972 and broke up with four years later, said their only daughter 'accepted a long time ago' that she had been disinherited by her father.</p>

<p>She said last night: 'I haven't seen Dudley for more than 40 years but it doesn't surprise me that Snagbrook Farm has gone under the hammer for £1.5million when he only sold it for £325,000. He was like that - never really had any good business sense.</p>

<p>'Our daughter has lost out on a quite a bit of money but to be honest she accepted years ago that that was probably going to be the case.</p>

<p>'I've haven't had anything to do with Dudley for a long time as we were only married for four years before splitting.</p>

<p>'But last year I had an attack of conscience and rang Kent Social Services to enquire of his whereabouts in case he'd been killed and dumped in a ditch somewhere.</p>

<p>'They told me nothing but they didn't seem too concerned for his well-being.</p>

<p>'I did hear something from a friend but it's third-hand so I don't know how reliable the information is. </p>

<p>'She said that a friend of hers had been part of a group from Hollingbourne, which included Dudley, who would go on excursions to France.  </p>

<p>'One of the group had died last year and this lady phoned Snagbrook Farm to let Dudley know and to inform him of funeral details. </p>

<p>'Dudley is supposed to have answered the house phone suggesting that he was living there with the Vincents.  </p>

<p>'Where he is now, now that the house has been sold goodness knows. But whatever has happened he's probably brought it on himself.' </p>

<p>The main farmhouse is believed to date back to the 16th century with a 19th century facade boasting internal period features including panelled walls, fireplaces and leaded light windows </p>

<p>The £1.5m sale prompted anger among locals who know Mr Wright and accused the Vincents of taking advantage of a vulnerable old man</p>

<p>Rumours are widely circulating within Hollingbourne that Mr Wright was taken to Ashford or Sittingbourne by Mr Vincent senior and that he may still be living there. </p>

<p>Mr Wright was once a vocal member of their community but fears were raised at a local parish council meeting in October 2016 when members spoke about how the pensioner had had not been seen around the area. </p>

<p>The farm's sale has sparked fresh concerns about Mr Wright (above on his wedding day) and what has happened to him</p>

<p>Mike Bedwell, the then leader of the Parish Council, said: 'He used to be seen regularly out and about doing his shopping in the local convenience store and the owner was his friend.</p>

<p>'He is an elderly gentleman who used to write a lot of complaining letters to the parish council, but they stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>'We have heard he is still living on the property but there have also been rumours that he was in a mobile home, in care or living above a shop in Ashford. We have checked and there is no sign of him.' </p>

<p>However, at the following month's meeting, it was recorded that 'PCSO Dave Rowley has visited a local pensioner who had not been seen for some time by neighbours and he was found to be living with a carer and in good spirits' and that the police do not have any concerns about his welfare but will monitor the situation. </p>

<p>Snagbrook Farm was put up for sale this week by Clive Emson auctioneers with a £1.5 million guide price, sparking three days of intense online interest.</p>

<p>Kevin Gilbert of Clive Emson told MailOnline: 'The property was sold for £1.5millon to an undisclosed buyer from Kent.</p>

<p>'We were aware of the previous media reports around this particular property and we had a lot of interest when putting it up for auction on Monday.</p>

<p>'The deeds were in the name of Mr Vincent and the property was sold on his behalf.</p>

<p>'Snagbrook is a fabulous place in a stunning setting but the owner is going to have to spend a few quid doing it up.</p>

<p>'The main house is Grade II listed so the new owner will have to comply with conservation orders but it's a blank canvass and could become a really fantastic property.'</p>

<p>The main farmhouse is believed to date back to the 16th century with a 19th century facade boasting internal period features including panelled walls, fireplaces and leaded light windows. </p>

<p>The site also includes a smaller bungalow, three barns, a mobile unit and a spring water-fed lake.</p>

<p>It is not known where the Vincents have moved to, but the family has been known to fleece the elderly in a variety of mainly building scams.</p>

<p>The Vincents' son Henry, 37, was living at Snagbrook Farm when he robbed the home of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks in Hither Green two years ago. The burglar ended up being stabbed with his own screwdriver during a scuffle with the former RAC office manager, and died after staggering onto the pavement. Pictured: Mourners leave tributes where he died </p>

<p>Mr Osborn-Brooks was initially arrested on suspicion of murder before being cleared of any wrong-doing, but the burglar's death prompted an outpouring of protest from the traveller community, to which the Vincents belong. Pictured: Mourners paying tribute to Vincent Jr</p>

<p>One of their victims was charged £72,000 to repair a single roof tile.</p>

<p>In 2003, Vincent Snr, now 61, was described as the leader of a seven-strong family gang of cowboy builders who had fleeced elderly householders of more than £1 million.</p>

<p>The gang would frogmarch their vulnerable victims to the bank after telling them their houses were about to fall down. </p>

<p>Their vile tricks of the trade include showing rotten pieces of wood they have brought with them to convince octogenarians they need repairs done.</p>

<p>They also like to squirt water onto the interior walls of pensioners' homes to pretend there is a damp problem.</p>

<p>The seven were jailed for a total of nearly 30 years. Vincent senior, now 59, was sentenced to five-and-a-half years.</p>

<p>Just five years later, in 2008, he swindled an 81-year-old man out of £72,000 for roof repairs and after going on on the run was caught in September 2010 and jailed for six years the following August.   </p>
