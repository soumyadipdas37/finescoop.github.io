        <p>Strangers have raised thousands of dollars to cover the legal fees of a pregnant mother after she was arrested over an anti-lockdown social media post. </p>

<p>Zoe Lee Buhler, 28, was wearing pyjamas as she was handcuffed in front of her children in her Ballarat lounge room, north-west of Melbourne, on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>She was charged with incitement after creating a Facebook protest event against Daniel Andrew's draconian lockdown in Victoria.</p>

<p>Buhler's brother Jordan created a GoFundMe page to raise money for her legal fees and fine. </p>

<p>Zoe Buhler, 28, was handcuffed in her lounge room in front of her children on Wednesday afternoon and charged with incitement</p>

<p>Buhler's brother Jordan created a GoFundMe page to raise money for her legal fees and fine. The page raised more than $8,600 before it was taken down</p>

<p>'All money raised will go straight to Help Zoe Lee pay her legal fees! Thank you!' the page reads.</p>

<p>'All money left after legal costs will be donated to suicide awareness. We will not be keeping a single cent of the money for ourselves. </p>

<p>'Let's get back our basic human rights.'</p>

<p>But the fundraiser was mysteriously taken down by its creator less than 24 hours after it was created.</p>

<p>The page had raised more than $8,600. </p>

<p>On Thursday morning, Buhler said she feared she was being 'kidnapped' when she was arrested.   </p>

<p>The fundraiser page said the cash raised would help Buhler pay her legal fees following Wednesday's arrest</p>

<p>'I was scared I was being kidnapped by people, they obviously weren't in uniforms,' she told media waiting outside her Miner's Rest home.</p>

<p>'I was just so scared, I was like oh my gosh if I disappear today I want it live on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I'm only very early pregnancy so obviously you're told not to stress out or strain.' </p>

<p>Buhler is about seven weeks pregnant - which she only discovered days ago - and was due to have her first ultrasound an hour after her arrest.</p>

<p>She said she was 'still yet to know exactly what [incitement] means' and planned to fight the charge, claiming it was an honest mistake.</p>

<p>'I just wanted to feel like I was doing something to stand up for human rights,' she said.  </p>

<p>'If someone steals a car, they know they are committing a crime. I didn't, so I don't feel like I should have to pay for that.' </p>

<p>Buhler, who claimed to have lost her job during the lockdown, said police eventually took her handcuffs off and let her get dressed before taking her to the station.</p>

<p>She claimed the officers said they weren't happy about having to arrest her.</p>

<p>Buhler allegedly created this event for Saturday at 11am on Sturt Street in Ballarat</p>

<p>Buhler later told radio station 3AW that she felt the police 'barging in' to her home and arresting her was 'extreme' and a phone call would have sufficed.</p>

<p>'I had a bit of a bimbo moment and I actually didn't realise that it wasn't okay. I thought so long as we social distanced and wore masks it was okay,' she said.</p>

<p>'I was aware that the protest coming up in Melbourne wasn't permitted, but I thought, in Ballarat, we're in Stage Three lockdown.</p>

<p>'I'm not a criminal person... If the police had just called me and told me to remove the post I would've done so.</p>

<p>'I understand police were doing their job and they were very nice for me, but I wasn't very happy with them barging into my house in front of my children.' </p>

<p>Zoe Buhler, 28, (pictured) said she feared she was being kidnapped during the arrest on Wednesday</p>

<p>Mother-of-two Buhler with her boyfriend James Timmins, who filmed her arrest</p>

<p>Buhler is not allowed on social media until Sunday as part of her bail terms, but hoped her arrest would raise opposition to the lockdown.</p>

<p>'It's pretty horrible circumstances but hopefully some good comes out of it,' she said.</p>

<p>'It might be a bit of an eye-opener about the human rights I'm trying to stand for and people realising just how out of control things are getting</p>

<p>'So many people have been affected by the lockdown, people are losing their jobs, the economy has collapsed, rise in suicide and domestic violence. I wish we could see a happy medium.</p>

<p>'I feel like Daniel Andrews is the one that should be feeling remorseful.' </p>

<p>Buhler's social media pages are full of coronavirus conspiracy theories, but she insisted she believed the pandemic was real.</p>

<p>Buhler's alleged offending post linked to a since-deleted 'Freedom Day Ballarat' event she created</p>

<p>Buhler is about seven weeks pregnant, only finding out days ago, and was due to have her first ultrasound an hour after her arrest</p>

<p>'My heart goes out to anyone who's died of covid, I know that people are getting sick, I don't believe it's a hoax or anything, I'm not a part of a cult,' she said.</p>

<p>Three other protest organisers around Victoria have been charged with incitement in the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Buhler created a since-deleted 'Freedom Day Ballarat' event planned for 11am on Saturday on Sturt Street. </p>

<p>Her 'peaceful protest' said that attendees would follow restrictions like wearing masks and social distancing 'so we don't get arrested'.</p>

<p>'As some of you may have seen, the government has gone to extreme measures and are using scare tactics through the media to prevent the Melbourne protest,' the event page read.</p>

<p>'Here in Ballarat we can be a voice for those is Stage Four lockdowns. We can be seen and hopefully make a difference!</p>

<p>'End lockdowns! Stand for human rights! We live in a free country!' </p>

<p>Buhler offered to delete the post but was told she had already committed an offence</p>

<p>Buhler's social media pages are full of coronavirus conspiracy theories, but she insisted she believed the pandemic was real</p>

<p>The video, which has since made international headlines in US and UK media, shows the confused mother asking why she is being arrested.  </p>

<p>'Excuse me, incitement for what, what on Earth? I'm in my pyjamas, my two kids are here,' she asked police.</p>

<p>'I have an ultrasound in an hour because I'm pregnant.'  </p>

<p>The increasingly distressed mother insisted she wasn't breaking any laws by creating and then promoting the event. </p>

<p>'Actually you are, that's why we're arresting you in relation to incitement,' police replied.</p>

<p>Buhler offered to delete the post as her boyfriend James Timmins tried to mediate while cradling their infant child in his arms.</p>

<p>'How about she just doesn't do the event? It's not like she's done it, she made a post,' he said.</p>

<p>Police were unmoved, telling her: 'You've already committed the offence.' </p>

<p>Buhler was distressed by this point and crying so much she could barely tell officers that she 'didn't realise' she was 'doing anything wrong' in making the online event.  </p>

<p>Police said they would seize all electronic devices in the house including those belonging to Mr Timmins and Buhler's sister. </p>

<p>Buhler was charged with later incitement released on bail to face Ballarat Magistrates Court on January 25 next year. </p>

<p>Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia anybody thinking of 'attending the protest... can expect a swift and firm response from police.'</p>

<p>'We will have no hesitation in issuing $1,652 fines to anyone who is breaching the restrictions on the day, or making arrests if necessary.' </p>

<p>Regional Victorian towns like Ballarat are spared the ultra-tough Stage Four lockdown but are still in Stage Three, making it illegal for more than two people to gather.</p>

<p>Police consider any protests to be in breach of these rules and have proved willing to arrest anyone organising or encouraging any gatherings.</p>

<p>Victoria Police claimed the protest would put lives at risk and anyone who showed up would be fined or arrested.  </p>

<p>State of disaster: Increased police powers to enforce the lockdown. Cautions will no longer be issued, only $1,652 fines or court summons</p>

<p>Curfew: No one allowed outside 8pm to 5am except for work, medical, caregiving - no shopping or exercising</p>

<p>Distance limit: Shopping and exercise can only be done 5km from home </p>

<p>Exercise: All recreational activity is banned and you can only exercise, with one other person, for one hour a day</p>

<p>Partners: You can visit a boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't live with you, even if they live more than 5km away </p>

<p>Shopping: Only one person can go shopping per household per day</p>

<p>Cafes and restaurants stay open for takeaway, as do supermarkets, etc</p>

<p>Schools: All students learning from home unless they are vulnerable or parents are essential workers. Kindy and childcare closed</p>

<p>Funerals: No change to funeral limits, but only 10 mourners can leave Melbourne to regional Victoria for one</p>

<p>Weddings: Completely banned</p>

<p>Public transport: Slashed after 8pm and cancelled late at night </p>
