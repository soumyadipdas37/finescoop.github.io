    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>The chief executive of Boohoo today told an inquest through tears how he slapped his 20-year-old's face then did CPR in a desperate bid to revive him after finding him dead in bed following a drugs binge. </p>

<p>Louis Butler Lyttle - son of the clothing firm's boss, John - was found unresponsive in his room at his family's secluded mansion in Kent on April 20, just days before his 21st birthday. </p>

<p>Mr Lyttle heard his son's alarm ringing at 5.50am to wake up for work but when he entered his bedroom, Louis appeared grey and was cold to the touch.</p>

<p>He slapped his face but there was no response so carried out CPR while waiting for an ambulance to arrive.</p>

<p>Paramedics took over at the family's home in a private road near Sevenoaks, but informed his heartbroken parents he had died at 6.20am and may have already been dead for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>A post-mortem found his cause of death was morphine toxicity.</p>

<p>Toxicologist David Rose found 'potentially fatal levels' of morphine in Louis' system.</p>

<p>Cocaine and by-product benzoylecgonine were also present but his blood alcohol level was below the drink drive limit.</p>

<p>Louis Lyttle,  20, the son of fast fashion chain boss John Lyttle, right, died at home near Sevenoaks in April after a drug and alcohol binge, an inquest has heard</p>

<p>John Lyttle, 51, was born in Ireland and after leaving school joined Primark as a trainee store manager.</p>

<p>Irish-born Mr Lyttle worked in Dublin where he met his future wife Clodagh, who also worked for the business in the 1990s.  </p>

<p>He rose through the ranks to the role of head of buying before joining the Arcadia Group, run by Sir Philip Green, as buying director in the UK.</p>

<p>Mr Lyttle then worked at Matalan for five years as trading director before returning to Primark in 2010.</p>

<p>He oversaw sales rocket to over £7billion in his role as chief operating officer.</p>

<p>When he was appointed chief executive of Boohoo its executive chairman Mahmud Kamani described himself as 'thrilled' to have him on board.</p>

<p>He described himself as a keen runner in a recent interview, but showed the scale of his ambition at the clothing company.</p>

<p>Mr Lyttle said: 'We might have started in the UK market. But really what we want to be is truly a global player'.</p>

<p>He is said to earn £1.6 million a year in the post he took up last March - reportedly operating on a salary of £615,000 plus a potential annual bonus of £900,000.</p>

<p>And if he can boost Boohoo's value from £2 billion to £5 billion, he stands to take home an eyewatering £50 million bonus.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, he described himself as a 'straight talker'.</p>

<p>But he has had to battle a number of scandals in his first year in the job. </p>

<p>It is alleged staff were paid way below the minimum wage and were not given up-to-scratch PPE.</p>

<p>Mr Lyttle has been forced to launch a review into what has happened in the company's UK supply chain.</p>

<p>Boohoo have found no evidence that staff were paid £3.50 per hour. </p>

<p>Coroner Alan Blunsdon said today: 'This was the death of a naive young man who used a high level of substance with catastrophic effects.</p>

<p>'There is no evidence of drug addiction or abuse.</p>

<p>'Immediately before his death Louis had used illicit drugs but the circumstances of that use have not been revealed by the police investigation.</p>

<p>'There is no evidence or suspicion to support Louis intended to take his own life.'</p>

<p>Mr Lyttle, who attended the inquest at County Hall in Maidstone, Kent by video link, appeared tearful as Mr Blunsdon recorded a verdict of misadventure and passed on his condolences to the family.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Sarah Stevenson found Louis on the floor next to the bed after he had been moved in attempts to revive him.</p>

<p>She also found a large matchbox, a very small amount of white substance, two small pieces of cling film and an empty vitamin pipette in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Bottles of beer were also hidden behind the pipework and empty lager cans were stuffed inside a suitcase concealed in his room.</p>

<p>Ms Stevenson believed 'these were elements that he didn't want to be seen' as his parents were unaware of the hidden alcohol.</p>

<p>She spoke with the father to identify that it was his son Louis and found his driving license and passport in his bedroom.</p>

<p>His bag had also been packed to go to work the following morning.</p>

<p>A GP report found he 'did not have any significant medical history' and denied taking any medication or recreational drugs when seen on July 3, 2019.</p>

<p>The family had a takeaway on the Friday evening but Louis told his dad he had been sick all night.</p>

<p>He appeared unwell throughout the whole of Saturday but was able to have breakfast on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>At around 4pm, Louis went out in the car and didn't say where he was going.</p>

<p>Mr Lyttle assumed he had 'popped to the supermarket' and returned around an hour and a half later.</p>

<p>Louis had two beers and a glass of wine with his Sunday dinner at 8pm before being found dead the following morning.</p>

<p>In a statement read out by Mr Blunsdon, the deceased's father said: 'Louis was a positive character and had plans for the future.</p>

<p>'He was positive about work.</p>

<p>'As parents we had a concern he may have used drugs recreationally.</p>

<p>'He did say he been experimenting but didn't say what.</p>

<p>'He did say he had been taking Xanax because he was stressed with exams.</p>

<p>'But we had no concerns about Louis' lifestyle or mental health.'</p>

<p>In a statement read out by the coroner, Louis, pictured was described as a 'positive character'</p>

<p>Louis, who worked for his father John (pictured) at Boohoo, was pronounced dead by paramedics at 6.20am on April 20</p>

<p>The family's home is on a private narrow country lane surrounded by woodland and fields with three adjoining properties on the sprawling private gated estate.</p>

<p>Louis' LinkedIn profile says he had been working as a 'business professional' at Boohoo since last July, having previously interned at investment banking firm Investec.</p>

<p>He attended the independent King's School in Canterbury, Kent - where fees are as high as £27,495 a year.</p>

<p>Louis later studied business management at Cardiff University but his 'heart wasn't in his degree' and he quit during his second year at Easter 2019.</p>

<p>Louis - born in Galway, Ireland - also interned at Indian financial services company Religare.  </p>
