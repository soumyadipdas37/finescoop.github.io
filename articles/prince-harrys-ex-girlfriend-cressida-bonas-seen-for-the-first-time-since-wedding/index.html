        <p>Actress Cressida Bonas has been seen for the first time since getting married in a private countryside wedding. </p>

<p>The 31-year-old, who dated the Duke of Sussex, 35, for three years until 2014, was spotted taking a stroll through the streets of London wearing her new wedding band after a low key wedding during lockdown. </p>

<p>She tied the knot with Harry Wentworth-Stanley, the estate agent son of the Marchioness of Milford Haven, at the exclusive Cowdray Park, in Midhurst, West Sussex, on 27th July. </p>

<p>The White House Farm actress looked effortlessly cool, wearing a pair of rolled up mom jeans with a white short-sleeved blouse. </p>

<p>Cressida Bonas, 31, was seen out for the first time since her marriage to fiance Harry Wentworth-Stanley in July, while strolling through London </p>

<p>The Prince's effortlessly cool ex-girlfriend was seen wearing a pair of mom jeans and a lose white blouse with short sleeves as she took to the streets in the capital </p>

<p>Cressida and Harry tied the knot on July 27 during lockdown, after the socialite announced her engagement to the estate agent in August last year. He popped the question with a stunning ruby ring during a trip to the US</p>

<p>The ITV drama White House Farm actress was seen for the first time wearing her new gold wedding band which perfectly matches her beautiful ruby engagement ring</p>

<p>Walking along the pavement with headphones in, she added a thin gold necklace to the look, which perfectly complimented her large engagement ring and new matching wedding band. </p>

<p>Her beautiful blonde locks were styled in loose waves and the look was finished off with a pair of white trainers and black shades. </p>

<p>Speaking a few days after the wedding, a friend of the bride and groom told MailOnline Cressida wanted to marry in private because she was aware Prince Harry was in the news at the time. </p>

<p>The socialite walked along the pavement with headphones in, carrying her phone in her hand. She added a thin gold necklace to the look which perfectly complimented her large engagement ring and new wedding band</p>

<p>Her beautiful blonde locks were styled in loose waves and the look was finished off with a pair of white trainers, with bright pink striped socks and some black shades</p>

<p>The Prince's former love interest tied the knot with Harry Wentworth-Stanley, the estate agent son of the Marchioness of Milford Haven, at the exclusive Cowdray Park, in Midhurst, West Sussex, on July 27</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas started dating in the spring of 2012. Two years later the couple made their first official public appearance at a royal engagement when Cressida joined Harry at the WE Day event at Wembley, pictured </p>

<p>The weekend of their special day came just before the explosive Finding Freedom biography, which delved into Harry and Meghan's rift with the Royal Family, was also released and Cressida wanted to avoid being in the spotlight.</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Cressida split in 2014, reportedly because Cressida was tired of the scrutiny that came with dating a member of the royal family. </p>

<p>However the couple remain on good terms and socialise in similar circles, with Princess Eugenie, who introduced the couple, among Cressida's closest friends.</p>

<p>Cressida even attended her ex-boyfriend's wedding to Meghan Markle in May 2018.</p>

<p>The loved-up pair exchanged vows in late July but a friend of the bride and groom told MailOnline Cressida wanted to marry in private because she was aware Prince Harry was in the news at the time</p>

<p>The weekend of the couple's special day, the explosive Finding Freedom biography, which dove into Harry and Meghan's rift with the Royal Family, was also released and Cressida wanted to stay out of the spotlight </p>

<p>The star of Whie House Farm cut a relaxed figure as she was seen in public for the first time since her July wedding </p>

<p>Prince Harry and Cressida split in 2014, reportedly because Cressida was tired of the scrutiny that came with dating a member of the royal family but they remained good friends, with Cressida even attending his wedding to Meghan Markle in 2018</p>

<p>A family member told MailOnline that just 30 of Cressida and Harry's closest family and friends attended the ceremony in July, in keeping with the government's Covid-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>'It was a beautiful ceremony and they are just so happy,' the source said. 'It was a very private and intimate ceremony and that is what they wanted.</p>

<p>'Cressida looked stunning and was radiant. We are just all so happy for them and it was a great day but they did request that no one talks about it.'</p>

<p>A friend added: 'Cressida did not want a big fuss,and did not want others to talk about it. You most certainly will not be seeing her wedding in Hello magazine. </p>

<p>'She is also was aware that [Prince] Harry is in the headlines and knew the attention her wedding would attract if it leaked out.'</p>

<p>In May Cressida hinted that their original wedding had to be postponed due to the current crisis, posting a snap as she and Harry posed in front of an 'Auto-wed' machine in fancy dress </p>

<p>While they have both moved on and married other people, Harry and Cressida remained on good terms and socialise in similar circles, with Princess Eugenie, who introduced the couple, among Cressida's closest friends</p>

<p>Only 30 people are said to have attended the newlyweds private countryside wedding, due to lockdown restrictions limiting the number of guests allowed to attend</p>

<p>On the day of their wedding, Cressida had her blonde hair pulled back into a casual updo and wore a simple white dress which fell above her knees</p>

<p>The bride's brother, Jacobi Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, shared an Instagram photo of the happy couple 'riding off into their beautiful future' on horseback. </p>

<p>Cressida has her blonde hair pulled back into a casual updo and her simple white dress fell above her knees.</p>

<p>Cowdray estate comprises 16,500 acres and includes the pitches where Harry and brother Prince William often competed during their polo playing days. It also boasts a golf course, farm shop, cafe and holiday cottages.</p>

<p>The stunning 19th century Cowdray House can be rented out for weddings of up to 150 people.</p>

<p>Cressida and Prince Harry broke up in 2015 after she was said to have struggled with the pressure of royal life during her romance with the Queen's grandson. Pictured, in March 2014 </p>

<p>The actress has previously revealed how her 'dream day' was a small, non-traditional wedding not in a church - the complete opposite to her ex-boyfriend's nuptials. Pictured: Cressida at Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle in May 2018</p>

<p>Cressida is the only child of 1960s 'It' Girl Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon and her third husband, Old Harrovian entrepreneur Jeffrey Bonas</p>

<p>The estate is owned by Viscount Cowdray, a close friend of the groom's stepfather and mother, the Marquess and Marchioness of Milford Haven whose own 1,000 acre estate, Great Trippetts, is less than 10 miles away.</p>

<p>The Marchioness, Clare Mountbatten, is also an avid polo player and regular at Cowdray Park. Cressida has previously been photographed at the polo park while a guest at charity events.</p>

<p>It is not known who attended the wedding but the couple both come from large families that would quickly make up the 30 people maximum.</p>

<p>Cressida is the only child of 1960s 'It' Girl Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon and her third husband, Old Harrovian entrepreneur Jeffrey Bonas.</p>

<p>The actress, who appeared in ITV drama White House Farm, has three half-brothers from her father Jeffrey Bonas' first marriage, George, Charles and Henry Bonas.</p>

<p>Her husband Harry is the second child of Nick-Wentworth-Stanley and his first wife Clare, now Marchioness of Milford Haven</p>

<p>The actress, who appeared in ITV drama White House Farm, has three half-brothers from her father Jeffrey Bonas' first marriage, George, Charles and Henry Bonas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her mother has four children to her first two husbands: Pandora Cooper-Key, daughter of Esmond Cooper-Key, and sculptor Georgiana Anstruther, Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, and Jacobi Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, the children of property developer John Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. Isabella is married to Sir Richard Branson's son Sam.</p>

<p>Harry is the second child of Nick-Wentworth-Stanley and his first wife Clare, now Marchioness of Milford Haven.</p>

<p>Cressida and Harry, pictured in 2017, dated in university before rekindling their romance after her split from Prince Harry</p>

<p>Harry Wentworth-Stanley, an associate director at estate agents Savills, is the son of Nick Wentworth-Stanley, a debonair Old Etonian, and Clare, now the Marchioness of Milford Haven, who acquired the title upon her second marriage to Harry’s stepfather, the Marquess of Milford Haven.  </p>

<p>Before his relationship with his now wife became official, Harry, who is dashingly handsome and 6ft 4in tall, was regarded as one of London's most eligible bachelors.   </p>

<p>He inherited his looks from his mother, Clare, a beauty who remains stunning. There was a brother, James, four years his senior, and younger sister Louisa. When Harry was a child, his mother and father divorced. In 1997, Clare married George, Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of the Queen, himself divorced with two children.</p>

<p>The family settled at Great Trippetts, an estate set in 1,000 acres in the Sussex Downs. For a time, life was perfect. Clare stayed on good terms with her former husband, Nick Wentworth-Stanley, who went on to marry Dutch beauty Millie Brenninkmeyer, with whom he had three more children. </p>

<p>Shortly before Christmas 2006, the Marquess and Marchioness and their children went to stay with Nick and his wife in Worcestershire. James, Harry’s elder brother, was recovering from a relatively minor procedure. The operation was a success, but James had become very anxious in the days that followed.</p>

<p>Harry Wentworth-Stanley, an associate director at estate agents Savills, is the son of Nick Wentworth-Stanley, a debonair Old Etonian, and Clare, now the Marchioness of Milford Haven, who acquired the title upon her second marriage to Harry’s stepfather, the Marquess of Milford Haven. Pictured, the Marquess and Marchioness in 2017</p>

<p>One evening, the family were gathered in the house when they heard a shot fired. They rushed outside to find James lying dead.</p>

<p>The family was shattered by the tragedy.</p>

<p>Clare was floored by her son’s suicide. Touchingly, it was Harry, then 17, who helped her through it. She said in an interview 18 months after James’ death: ‘For the sake of the other children, you have to set an example. If you are strong, it gives them permission to be strong. If you fall to bits, they will.</p>

<p>Harry's father is Nick Wentworth-Stanley, pictured, a debonair Old Etonian</p>

<p>‘The day after James died, his brother Harry said his biggest fear was that it would destroy me, and that would destroy everything else. It suddenly made me feel how important I was.’</p>

<p>The couple had a serious relationship when they were both students at Leeds University. The couple were known to their crowd — for reasons that aren’t entirely clear — as ‘Water-Cress’. The romance petered out when he took off for a gap year to Argentina in 2011 after graduating.</p>

<p>Friends have previously said Cressida wasn’t quite over Harry when another Harry — Prince Harry himself — began pursuing her in the summer of 2012 and a romance began. There were concerts, rugby matches, skiing trips and cosy nights in at Kensington Palace.  </p>

<p>However the couple split in 2014 after three years together. </p>

<p>The following year Harry Wentworth-Stanley and Cressida were photographed on a Valentine's Day date, although their relationship became public and official in 2017. </p>

<p>In August last year Harry proposed while on a trip to the US and the couple's smiles in the Instagram announcement told followers all they needed to know about their love for each other.  </p>

<p>Harry as a young boy with his stepfather, Marquess of Milford Haven (left), sister Louise (front), mother Clare (centre), the Marquess' brother Lord Ivar Mouthbatten, his children Ella and Alix and then wife Penny (right) at Cowdray Park in 2001</p>

<p>His older brother James Wentworth-Stanley, took his own life in 2006 at the age of 21, and he has a younger sister, Louisa, born in 1993.</p>

<p>His father went onto have three more children with his second wife, Mille Brenninkmeyer, while his mother, now Marchioness of Milford Haven, inherited two stepchildren on her marriage to the Queen's cousin, George Mountbatten.</p>

<p>Cressida, who appeared in this year's ITV drama White House Farm, announced her engagement to estate agent Harry in August 2019. The couple first dated while studying at university before rekindling their romance in 2017.</p>

<p>In May she hinted that their original wedding had to be postponed due to the current crisis, posting a snap as she and Harry posed in front of an 'Auto-wed' machine in fancy dress outfits.</p>

<p>Sharing the photo on Instagram, Cressida wished her beau a happy birthday before commenting: 'Well, if all else fails there’s always Auto Wed...! Happy birthday my heart. #OneDay.'</p>

<p>Cowdray Park is a world-famous estate home to royal polo matches located in West Sussex. </p>

<p>Almost every royal from the Queen to Prince Harry has frequented the site nestled in the South Downs to watch a polo match or two.</p>

<p>The park is recognised as the home of British Polo and has hosted polo for more than 100 years, with the first tournament recorded in 1910.</p>

<p>It also offers clay pigeon shooting and corporate activity days, as well as the more traditional activities of agriculture, forestry and property lets. </p>

<p>The park also has a golf course and in recent years has become a popular wedding venue for the wealthy. </p>

<p>Cowdray Park is a world-famous estate home to royal polo matches located in West Sussex. Pictured, Cowdray Park where society weddings are held</p>

<p>There are several options available to couple wanting to tie the knot on the estate, including the option of a small outdoor service in the Walled Garden, or a more formal sit-down meal in the ballroom of 19th century Cowdary House. Events can also be held at the golf clubhouse. </p>

<p>The house, which is available for exclusive hire, is set in extensive landscaped grounds and a manicured croquet lawn with a far-reaching view of the West Sussex South Downs, making it perfect for outdoor drinks receptions. </p>

<p>There are also 22 beautiful bedrooms available to the couple and their nearest and dearest. </p>

<p>The centrepiece of the property is Buck Hall, a stunning space with a vaulted ceiling, stained glass windows and a beautiful arched minstrel's gallery. </p>
