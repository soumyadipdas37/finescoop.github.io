        <p>Furious Tory MPs have turned on Boris Johnson after he threatened to impose a second national lockdown tonight unless the British people obey his 'authoritarian' new coronavirus restrictions.  </p>

<p>The beleaguered Prime Minister faced fire from all sides following his Commons speech today as he performed a screeching U-turn on his push to reopen workplaces again after just a few weeks.  </p>

<p>He also faced barbs for introducing other swingeing new measures including a 10pm pub curfew and £200 fines for mask rule-breakers in England in the face of rising coronavirus cases. </p>

<p>But speaking from Downing Street tonight, Mr Johnson warned that 'iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time'.</p>

<p>And he hit out at his critics, including Tory MPs who warned of the economic impact of lockdown, adding: 'To those who say we don't need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own.' </p>

<p>Responding to the Prime Minister's address, Telford MP Lucy Allan questioning on Twitter whether the UK's 'collective health' was really at risk.</p>

<p>'Measures to tackle #covid must be proportionate to the risk,' she wrote. 'The virus is a serious threat to certain vulnerable groups. </p>

<p>'We must protect these groups with targeted measures. Shutting down society causes massive damage to health, lives, and livelihoods of the whole population.'  </p>

<p>Former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage blasted Mr Johnson's 'authoritarian' response to the coronavirus crisis as he bemoaned: 'We didn't vote for this'.</p>

<p>Tory MPs have turned on Boris Johnson after he threatened to impose a second national lockdown tonight unless the British people obey his draconian new coronavirus restrictions </p>

<p>Responding to the Prime Minister's address, Telford MP Lucy Allan questioning on Twitter whether the UK's 'collective health' was really at risk</p>

<p>Responding to the Prime Minister's address, former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage blasted Mr Johnson's 'authoritarian' response to the coronavirus crisis</p>

<p>Police have blasted Boris Johnson's new rules as 'absurd' and 'a nonsense' as small business owners say they will go bust if workers stay home again.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister faced fire from all sides as he U-turned on his push to reopen workplaces after just a few weeks to tell office staff to work from home if they can.</p>

<p>He was barbed for introducing new measures including a 10pm pub curfew and £200 fines for mask rule-breakers among new restrictions on social settings in England.</p>

<p>The PM also announced he is making the British Army available to help the police enforce stringent new coronavirus rules.</p>

<p>He said officers will now have the 'option to draw on military support where required' to free up staff so more can crackdown on rule-breakers as he revealed fines are being doubled to £200.</p>

<p>But Downing Street ruled out deploying soldiers on the streets, saying they would be used for 'backfilling certain duties, such as office roles and guarding protected sites, so police can be out enforcing the virus response'.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation Ken Marsh slammed the announcement as 'a nonsense' and National Chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales John Apter said it 'lacked any detail'.</p>

<p>He angrily tweeted: 'The PM says we are a 'freedom loving country', but will fine you £10,000 and send the army in if he likes. </p>

<p>'This is authoritarian – I don't believe his promises on testing or the competence of the government.</p>

<p>'We didn't vote for this.'   </p>

<p>Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: 'We all want nothing more than to beat this dreadful virus and get back to normal. Sadly, today's statement from the Prime Minister confirms this is a long way off and there will be difficult times ahead.</p>

<p>'The Prime Minister must take responsibility for what has gone wrong, and apologise for the chaotic failure of his ''world beating'' test and trace system. It is inexcusable that this vital test and trace operation has been totally overwhelmed in recent weeks. </p>

<p>'Ministers must outline details of the practical steps they are taking to fix the test and trace system as quickly as possible. This is the only way to avoid yet more restrictions.</p>

<p>'With millions of people worried about their jobs, businesses and livelihoods, the Prime Minister must also urgently set out a new economic plan, including the extension of furlough and more help for the self-employed and small business.' </p>

<p>Labour MP Chris Bryant slammed the Prime Minister's tone, tweeting: 'The problem with Johnson is he can't deliver a tough message. By saying he hates doing this he effectively undermines what he's doing. And throughout his talk about people breaking the rules I just thought of (chief adviser Dominic) Cummings.'</p>

<p>The Government rushed to Mr Cummings' defence after the Prime Minister's chief aide flouted lockdown rules by driving to Country Durham from London and back in April.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, London mayor Sadiq Khan, who threatened to force Londoners to wear face masks in all public spaces across the capital yesterday, supported the Prime Minister's 'early' actions. </p>

<p>He tweeted: 'We are now in a critical period to stop the spread of coronavirus. Cases are on the rise in the capital and the Government has failed to set up an adequate testing or contact tracing system. </p>

<p>'Londoners must redouble their efforts &amp; follow all the measures that have been laid out. I strongly believe that acting early, rather than having to impose more stringent measures later, is the right thing to do both for public health and the economy.'  </p>

<p>And Conservative MP Ben Bradley praised Mr Johnson, saying: 'Tone of @BorisJohnson address tonight spot on. We all need to take responsibility for keeping ourselves and others safe in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>'Good to see the boss looking well again too.' </p>

<p>Labour MP Chris Bryant slammed the Prime Minister's tone, tweeting: 'The problem with Johnson is he can't deliver a tough message'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, London mayor Sadiq Khan, who threatened to force Londoners to wear face masks in all public spaces across the capital yesterday, supported the Prime Minister's 'early' actions</p>

<p>Pub bosses and punters grappling with new coronavirus rules which make masks compulsory have warned Boris Johnson that enforcement will be tough.   </p>

<p>The Prime Minister today tightened restrictions on the hospitality sector for six months by imposing a 10pm curfew across England from Thursday and limiting business solely to table service.</p>

<p>Speaking in the House of Commons, he also said face coverings will be mandatory for all staff and customers unless they are seated.</p>

<p>The raft of measures was met with an instant backlash from the pub trade which said the 'devastating' curbs would torpedo sales and sink some firms.  </p>

<p>Greg Mulholland, campaign director for the Campaign for Pubs, said: 'It seems questionable asking people to wear face masks yet not at the table, and there is a fear that the need to have a mask will put people off going to pubs which could see levels of trade drop even further.'</p>

<p>Calling on the Government to provide financial support for pubs, he added: 'The confirmation of a curfew of 10pm and other restrictions for up to six months is devastating for many pubs and publicans. </p>

<p>'As it is, most pubs were only getting back on their feet and many were not yet trading profitably and this latest news will make it impossible for some publicans to carry on.'  </p>

<p>Jack Laing, 30, who manages a pub in Notting Hill, told MailOnline: 'The movement of people around the pub with a facemask will be difficult to police.'</p>

<p>Stressing that he will enforce the rules, he added: 'It's the same as track and trace. If they don't want to do it this isn't the place for them. Obviously it will be a challenge but we have to do it if we're going to be open.'  </p>

<p>The Prime Minister has already warned that the new curbs could last well into 2021, and tonight he warned it could take until then to get mass testing up and running fully and a new vaccine widely available.</p>

<p>He said: 'Though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet – of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. </p>

<p>'That's the hope; that's the dream. It's hard, but it's attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there.' </p>

<p>He continued: 'Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour.   </p>

<p>'If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come. And the fight against Covid is by no means over. </p>

<p>'I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through.' </p>

<p>Mr Johnson warned the Commons this afternoon that that the curbs may have to be left in place for six months, potentially ruining families Christmases and New Year celebrations, and taking the total time spent under coronavirus restrictions of some kind up to a calendar year. </p>

<p>The decision to urge workers to work from home sparked dire warnings about the future of struggling town and city centres as business groups immediately demanded the Government extend its furlough scheme which is due to close at the end of October.   </p>

<p>Mel Stride, the Tory chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, told the PM that lockdowns 'destroy jobs and also personal wellbeing' as he urged the Government to pay attention to the concerns of businesses.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson did not announce a ban on households mixing indoors in England but Nicola Sturgeon this afternoon followed Northern Ireland as she said that from tomorrow Scots will not be able to meet in other people's homes, prompting questions over which of the home nations has adopted the correct approach. </p>

<p>Tory MPs criticised the plans this afternoon as they warned of the economic damage the measures could have and asked what Mr Johnson's message is to 'grandparents who want to live their lives before it's too late and cannot see their families'. </p>

<p>The PM was also reminded that people 'are only young once' as he was told that 'blanket restrictions are affecting all people of all ages, immaterial of the actual risk posed to them'. </p>

<p>Conservative MPs also said their constituents would be furious at the new crackdown after they followed the Government's rules only to have seen 'people at protests, at street parties, not having action taken against them'.   </p>

<p>They also warned the decision to ditch the back to work drive will cause widespread 'dismay' among workers who live in 'cramped, overcrowded accommodation'.      </p>

<p>Mr Johnson faced an hour long grilling by MPs in the House of Commons this afternoon after he set out his proposals. </p>

<p>Mel Stride, the Tory chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, told the PM that lockdowns 'destroy jobs and also personal wellbeing' as he urged the Government to pay attention to the concerns of businesses. </p>

<p>He said: 'And the fact the lockdowns have damaged our national economy means that in the years ahead a smaller economy will probably have serious impacts on the health of millions of people up and down our country.' </p>

<p>He added: 'Yes, we should listen very carefully to the epidemiologists but we must also listen very carefully to the Treasury, to businesses and to economists too.'</p>

<p>Mr Johnson said Mr Stride was 'spot on' and 'that's why we have to take action now to avoid the risk of having to take more drastic action later on that would do greater economic damage'. </p>

<p>Tory Dame Cheryl Gillan referred to the PM's suggestion that the measures could be in place for six months as she asked: 'What does he say to grandparents who want to live their lives before it's too late and cannot see their families, to worried parents and families who cannot access a test at the moment, to workers and business owners facing financial ruin and to MPs that want to debate these matters in Parliament before they are decided, not after so they can help him shoulder this onerous responsibility?</p>

<p>'How can he convince all of them that he's taking the right path and unite our country with hope of an end to this misery?'</p>

<p>Mr Johnson replied: 'I thank (Dame Cheryl) and she is entirely right that Parliament should and will debate these issues and Mr Speaker will make time next week, in Government time, for a very full debate on these measures.'</p>

<p>Conservative former minister Andrew Percy told Mr Johnson: 'I must express to him the concern of constituents in my area where our seven-day rolling average is well below 20 and falling, where people have followed the rules and seen people at protests, at street parties, not having action taken against them and we will now suffer as a result of these further measures.'</p>

<p>Mr Johnson said the majority do feel 'let down by the minority who are not obeying the rules' and that is why the Government is toughening up enforcement measures and increasing fines to £200.        </p>

<p>Conservative former cabinet minister Stephen Crabb raised the issue of working from home. </p>

<p>He said: 'While working from home has been great for many – for senior managers living in larger properties with nice gardens – that hasn't been the experience for a great many others living in cramped, overcrowded accommodation.</p>

<p>'So does (Mr Johnson) recognise that there will be dismay today amongst those people for whom the return to Covid-secure workplaces has been so important for mental, physical, social wellbeing and it feels like it'll be a long six months for them having to work back in their own homes?'</p>

<p>Mr Johnson replied: 'Where people must go into work for their job, for their mental health, wellbeing or whatever it happens to be, then of course they should do so.</p>

<p>'What we're saying is you should work from home if you can.'</p>

<p>Tory Nick Fletcher said 'blanket restrictions are affecting all people of all ages, immaterial of the actual risk posed to them' as he suggested people should be able to carry out a 'personal Covid risk assessment'.   </p>

<p>He said the results could be used to determine whether 'someone needs to shield or can go about their daily lives'. </p>

<p>He added: 'This will help boost the economy while protecting the vulnerable. After all, many people's lives are being affected tremendously by these restrictions, especially the young, who as we all know – are only young once.'</p>

<p>But Mr Johnson told Mr Fletcher the 'tragedy of the coronavirus pandemic is that people who are not badly affected themselves can nonetheless pass it on unwittingly to older or more vulnerable people'.</p>

<p>'So your harmless cough can be someone else's death knell unfortunately, and that is why we have to apply the restrictions that we do,' he said.</p>

<p>Good evening, </p>

<p>The struggle against Covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime.</p>

<p>In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere.</p>

<p>Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families.</p>

<p>And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win – and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face – none of them easy – and why we must take action now.</p>

<p>I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before.</p>

<p>When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives.</p>

<p>And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay.</p>

<p>But we have to acknowledge this this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected.</p>

<p>The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing.</p>

<p>We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time; and I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress covid now.</p>

<p>So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not Covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply; and once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown.</p>

<p>I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament.</p>

<p>After discussion with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don't need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own.</p>

<p>The tragic reality of having Covid is that your mild cough can be someone else's death knell.</p>

<p>And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers.</p>

<p>That's why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to back-fill if necessary.</p>

<p>And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone's freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring.</p>

<p>If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-Covid medical needs.</p>

<p>And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend.</p>

<p>It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again.</p>

<p>But if people don't follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus.</p>

<p>That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before.</p>

<p>We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines – pioneered in this country – that can help save lives.</p>

<p>And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet - of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That's the hope; that's the dream. It's hard, but it's attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there.</p>

<p>But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour.</p>

<p>If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come.</p>

<p>And the fight against Covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead.</p>

<p>But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through. </p>
