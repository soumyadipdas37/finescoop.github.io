        <p>Coronation Street star Beverley Callard was one of the rumoured stars set to take on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! this year.</p>

<p>But since she revealed last week she can't walk, following her botched knee surgery, a TV source has stated the obvious and told The Sun they believe Beverley's involvement is off the cards.</p>

<p>'Beverley was signed up for the show when it was still planned to be in Australia. She was so excited to be able to come on board,' the source said. 'Obviously, with the surgery, she’s had complications no one could have foreseen.</p>

<p>Scuppered plans: Coronation Street star Beverley Callard was one of the rumoured stars set to take on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! this year</p>

<p>'There’s no way she’s able to take part in the show and fully experience it. At best, she might have been able to do the smaller tasks. But for most of them she’d have to sit out for medical reasons, which is no fun for Bev, nor for viewers.'</p>

<p>These comments are somewhat of an understatement seeing as the soap star, 63, revealed recently that she has been in excruciating agony for the past six months, after her routine hip operation left her fearing that she'd need a wheelchair, forcing her character to suddenly disappear from Corrie.</p>

<p>I'm A Celeb! - which is known to throw its stars out of helicopters and dangle them off the sides of buildings - is not taking place in Australia this year, but this doesn't make the lesser commute easier for Beverley.</p>

<p>The 2020 season will take place in a ruined Welsh castle in the middle of November - making conditions even tougher for those taking part.</p>

<p>Off the table? Since she revealed last week she can't walk, following her botched knee surgery, a TV source has stated the obvious and told The Sun they believe Beverley's involvement is off the cards</p>

<p>Queen of the castle? The 2020 season will take place in a ruined Welsh castle in the middle of November - making conditions even tougher for those taking part</p>

<p>Focused: She has revealed her hopes to be walking again by the end of 2020 after undergoing botched hip surgery</p>

<p>The actress has, however, vowed to film a proper sendoff for her long-running character Liz McDonald - insisting that she'll strut away from the cobbles in a pair of Liz's trademark high heels by hook or by crook.</p>

<p>Talking to The Mirror last weekend, Beverley said: 'I hope I’ll be back on my feet without crutches by the end of the year...</p>

<p>'Being physically fit and having that taken away from me was a shock. My heart goes out to people suffering with pain every single day. The pain drives you insane.'</p>

<p>She will be leaving the iconic ITV soap, but is determined to go out with a bang, even revealing that her character won't be killed off and that she may even return again one day in the future. </p>

<p>'As much as I hate Liz’s outfits, I can’t wait to get those heels on again,' she went on. 'This is the toughest fight of my life but I am determined to win it... </p>

<p>An exit to remember: The 63-year-old actress has vowed to film a proper sendoff for her long-running character Liz McDonald</p>

<p>'I am a strong woman but another strong woman in my life is Liz McDonald and she has been for 31 years. </p>

<p>'I love playing her and she has inspired me to want to get on my feet again so I can do it one last time. If there is anything apart from my family that makes me want to get back on my feet, it’s being Liz again.'</p>

<p>Beverley also revealed that producers were willing to write a wheelchair into Liz's exit, but that she refused this.</p>

<p>Sashay away! She insisted she'll strut away from the cobbles in a pair of Liz's trademark high heels by hook or by crook [pictured in character in 1990 with on-screen husband Charles Lawson]</p>

<p>'It wouldn’t work for me or for Liz! As soon as I’m well enough I will film Liz’s exit. I just hope it’s a belter.'</p>

<p>Liz first appeared on Corrie in 1989 and has appeared almost consistently on the show for three decades, taking years off here and there.</p>

<p>The feisty character -  who has dealt with feuds, death and divorce - is unlikely to find a happy ending, however, according to Beverley.</p>

<p>Pain: The 63-year-old actress opened up on the excruciating agony she has been enduring amid her sudden disappearance from the show</p>

<p>'I’d love for Liz to find happiness, romance and everything else. I doubt that will happen as they never do that for Liz,' she said, before confirming soap bosses want to 'leave the door open' for a return.</p>

<p>Beverley is suing the hospital responsible for her operation after a second opinion from a doctor led to her minor keyhole surgery being changed to a full hip replacement. </p>

<p>'It has been the worst six months of my life. I have been in the most excruciating pain you can imagine – like teeth grinding inside my hip,' she previously told The Mirror. </p>

<p>'Worse than that was the mental torture of thinking, "Is this the end for me?" A huge part of me thought I’d never be able to return to Coronation Street – that I wouldn't even walk again.'</p>

<p>Queen Liz: 'I’d love for Liz to find happiness, romance and everything else. I doubt that will happen as they never do that for Liz,' she said, before confirming soap bosses want to 'leave the door open' for a return</p>

<p>The star, who admitted that she had even considered installing a stair lift as she could barely walk, opened up on her fear of losing her job and ability to walk. </p>

<p>She explained: 'Liz is famous for mini skirts, stockings and high heel shoes. Not crutches and a mobility scooter. I thought I wouldn’t be able to do my job any more. That is how bad it has been. There was definite doubt over whether I would walk again.'</p>

<p>The blonde revealed that after initially quitting the cobbles, she changed her mind and had agreed to stay another year.</p>

<p>But earlier this month fans were left baffled as Liz suddenly left Weatherfield off-screen, with it revealed that she had moved to Spain. </p>

<p>Nightmare: In a new interview, Beverley reveals she's had the 'worst six months of my life' after a routine hip operation left her fearing that she'd need a wheelchair </p>

<p>However, her plans to continue on the show were scuppered by the operation, with the star explaining the pain in the aftermath was 'absolute hell'.</p>

<p>Beverley's nightmare began when she visited her GP in March to seek advice on a 'niggle in my hip, in my groin on the right side'.</p>

<p>Her doctor said it could easily be fixed with a small operation, however, what followed was a world of pain for the star.</p>

<p>Beverley explained that following what she thought was a 'minor operation' at the hospital, which she is not naming for legal reasons, she was told that the surgery didn't go as planned.</p>

<p>Shock: The star revealed that she is suing the hospital which carried out the operation after a second opinion from a doctor led to her minor keyhole surgery being changed to a full hip replacement (pictured in character in 2015)</p>

<p>She explained to the publication that she was told afterwards that during the procedure, her hip had 'crumbled' and that she needed 'further operations' while there.</p>

<p>Days after being released from the hospital, Beverley began to experience excruciating pain which only grew worse.</p>

<p>Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the thespian was left in agony for months while she waited for a new operation.</p>

<p>It wasn't until a trauma surgeon pal stepped in that Beverley, who was left in constant 'tears' over the pain, got a new appointment the next day, with the surgery following afterwards.</p>

<p>Agony: 'I have been gone because it has been the worst six months of my life. I have been in the most excruciating pain you can imagine – like teeth grinding inside my hip'</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Coronation Street fans said they were 'gutted' after Beverley's character Liz was given a quiet exit despite being on the soap for 31 years. </p>

<p>The popular character, was said to have left the cobbles and moved to Spain during the episode.</p>

<p>After the episode aired several people took to Twitter to express their confusion and frustration at the storyline, with one saying Liz 'did not deserve an off-screen exit'. </p>

<p>During the episode Liz's absence was mentioned by Leanne Battersby, played by Jane Danson, and Steve McDonald, played by Simon Gregson, her son.  </p>

<p>During one conversation Leanne said to Steve: 'I don't suppose it helps that your mum's in Spain either.'</p>

<p>Change of plan: The blonde revealed that after initially quitting the cobbles, she changed her mind and had agreed to stay another year (pictured with onscreen ex husband Jim in 2018)</p>

<p>'Hell': However, her plans to continue on the show were scuppered by the operation, with the star explaining the pain in the aftermath was 'absolute hell' (pictured with onscreen son Steve in 2010)</p>

<p>Several avid fans were left 'gutted' at Liz's underwhelming exit and took to Twitter to vent their frustration. </p>

<p>Corrie fan account Coronation Street Memories wrote: 'Gutted at this. Bev /Liz deserved a proper exit!'</p>

<p>While another fan said: 'What's the storyline with Liz McDonald in #corrie. I must have missed something'</p>

<p>Someone else added: 'So apparently Liz won't be returning to Corrie and last night's episode where they mentioned she had gone to Spain will be the last we hear about her. LIZ MCDONALD DID NOT DESERVE AN OFF-SCREEN EXIT' </p>

<p>And another disappointed fan questioned: 'Has Liz McDonald left #corrie for Spain??? Did they not film any final scenes?' </p>

<p>'Gutted': Earlier this month, Coronation Street fans said they were 'gutted' after Beverley's character Liz was given a quiet exit despite being on the soap for 31 years (pictured with her onscreen family in 1989)</p>
