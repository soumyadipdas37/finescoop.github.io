        <p>White House Farm killer Jeremy Bamber gave away his guilt by 'sulking like a child' at the funeral of his parents and sister after shooting them dead in cold blood, a new documentary reveals.</p>

<p>Bamber, 59, who is serving a life sentence for the murders of his parents, sisters and twin nephews at their Essex farm, didn't demonstrate the physical cues that one would expect to see in someone in genuine mourning, experts explain.</p>

<p>Body language expert Cliff Lansley, who analysed footage and photos of Bamber for QuestRed documentary Faking It: Tears of a Crime, explained there are several tell-tale signs that strongly indicate he was faking his emotions. </p>

<p>'Genuine sadness has to be accompanied with a dropping of the lip corners with two muscles here which pull the lip corners downwards,' he said, looking at a photo of Bamber with his then girlfriend at the 1985 funeral. </p>

<p>Jeremy Bamber, 59, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for the murders of five family members at their Essex farm, didn't demonstrate the physical cues that one would expect to see in someone in genuine mourning, experts explain. In this photo, Bamber's eyebrows suggest significant sadness but his mouth is not turned down to match, suggesting he's faking</p>

<p>This photo gives an even clearer indication that Bamber is faking, according to a body language expert. The murderer has forced a 'horseshoe' shape with his mouth to try and communicate sadness but uses different muscles in doing so, revealing the expression is not one of genuine sadness. Instead he looks like a child who is 'pouting' and 'sulking'</p>

<p>'When you have sadness that's intent enough to raise the brows that high, we always see engagement of the mouth muscles drawn down, and that isn't present here. </p>

<p>'All we see on the lower half of the face is the slight jaw drop with the mouth open. But there is no indication of the muscle movement that we'd need to see to judge this as reliable sadness.' </p>

<p>Analysing another angle of Bamber at the funeral, Cliff identified the moment Bamber gives away his guilt by pouting like a 'sulking child' for the cameras, rather than displaying genuine remorse. </p>

<p>'He's created a horseshoe but he's using the wrong muscles. And how do we know that? It's because we can see the dimpling as we move in, we can see the crease on the chin boss, and we can see the pout on his bottom lip,' he argued, commenting on Bamber's feigned frown. </p>

<p>'Some people call that a pout, and we see it with sulking children who are faking sadness. And from this, as far as sadness is concerned, we can be sure that he's faking it. I'm very confident that he's not sad, this is a fake pose.' </p>

<p>Off camera, Bamber continued to behave strangely. As forensic psychologist Kerry Daynes highlights, Bamber's behaviour at the funeral was not what you would expect of someone who had just lost his entire family. Pictured, Bamber smiles as he is led away after being arrested </p>

<p>Off camera, Bamber continued to behave strangely. </p>

<p>As forensic psychologist Kerry Daynes highlights, Bamber's behaviour at the funeral was not what you would expect of someone who had just lost his entire family. </p>

<p>'He certainly put on a good show for photographers, but what TV viewers didn't know was just a few minutes later Bamber seems to have made a very speedy recovery, because he's on his way to the crematorium and he's apparently larking about and making smutty jokes,' she explains.</p>

<p>'So how was he able to do that after being in such a state of devastation just a few minutes beforehand?' </p>

<p>Following the funeral, Bamber's attitude towards the death of his family soon turned from flippant to callous. </p>

<p>Sheila 'Bambi' Caffell, who was murdered in August 1985 along with her six-year-old twin sons and the couple who adopted her, Nevill and June Bamber</p>

<p>'Bamber set about trying to sell anything that was of any value in the farmhouse, and he even had his mum's beloved dog put to sleep,' Kerry says. 'He also tried to sell pictures of Sheila topless to a tabloid newspaper for £20,000.' </p>

<p>Eventually, Bamber's lies caught up with him, and following new evidence coming to light and a lengthy trial, he was convicted of the murders and jailed in 1986. </p>

<p>But to this day, Bamber continues to campaign for early release and to clear his name. Speaking on audio tape in 2011, Bamber describes the last phone call he says he received from his father, who had apparently explained how his sister had gone 'crazy with the gun.' But Bamber continues to fake his innocence. </p>

<p>As Professor of Linguistics Dawn Archer argues, Bamber's reaction to this phone call was 'too matter of fact' and lacked the appropriate emotion expected of someone who has been told their family's lives are in danger. </p>

<p>White House Farm at Tolleshunt D'Arcy, near Maldon, in Essex, pictured, where Bamber is alleged to have shot dead his mother, father, sister and twin nephews in August 1985</p>

<p>'It sounds an odd reaction to be so matter of fact without also telling us that it was an emotional upheaval,' she says. 'This is someone who is articulate, who is good with words, he can be convincing, and he can sound very credible. One of the things we need to be careful about is that truth and credibility are not the same thing.'</p>

<p>In the early hours of 7th August 1985, police arrived at White House Farm, located just outside of Tolleshunt D'Arcy in rural Essex, following calls of a domestic disturbance. According to 24-year-old Jeremy Bamber, who made the call to the police, his sister Sheila Caffell had 'gone berserk' with a gun during a manic episode. Entering the house, armed officers discovered a scene of utter carnage, finding Sheila, along with her adopted parents Nevill and June Bamber and her six-year-old twin sons Nicholas and Daniel, shot dead. </p>

<p>At first police believed that Sheila had committed the murders before turning the gun on herself, but the truth was much more sinister. Revelling in the subsequent media frenzy that surrounded the murders, Jeremy Bamber played the role of the grieving son. But in reality, Bamber had slaughtered his family in a vicious execution-style killing spree. </p>

<p>Jeremy Bamber, 59, is serving life behind bars after being found guilty of murdering his adoptive parents Nevill and June, his sister Sheila Caffell, 26, and her six-year-old twins Daniel and Nicholas at White House Farm in 1985</p>

<p>For the murders of his parents, his sister and his two nephews, Jeremy Bamber was sentenced to five life terms, and ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years. </p>

<p>As Kerry Daynes concludes, Bamber's feigned grief and lies were all part of his plan to get away with murder. 'I think this is testimony to how intelligent he is and what a great illusionist he is, because he's managed to create all of this white noise around this case when the truth is really simple: he did it.' </p>

<p>For Sergeant Chris Bews, who was first on the scene at White House Farm leading the three-man response team, there has never been any doubt in his mind that Bamber is guilty. 'My two colleagues and I basically left the scene and we'd not gone 50 yards down the road when both my colleagues said 'he's done it, hasn't he? He's done it,' he recalls. 'They had gotten the same impression as well, that he was putting on a big act.'</p>
