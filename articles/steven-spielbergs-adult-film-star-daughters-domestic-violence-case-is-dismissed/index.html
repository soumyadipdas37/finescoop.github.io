        <p>The domestic violence case against the adopted daughter of Steven Spielberg has been dismissed, but she said the 'wrongful arrest' will take months to properly heal.  </p>

<p>In statement to Instagram, Mikaela Spielberg suggested that she was targeted by Tennessee authorities for being a sex worker.</p>

<p>The domestic assault charges against Mikaela, 24, were dropped in court this week after she was first arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex-fiancé in March.</p>

<p>The domestic assault charges filed against Mikaela Spielberg (pictured) were dropped in a Tennessee court on Tuesday</p>

<p>Mikaela was charged with domestic assault causing bodily harm against Chuck Pankow, 47, and booked into the Hill Detention Center in Nashville, Tennessee.   </p>

<p>The incident reportedly sparked after Mikaela and Pankow got into an argument after returning from a bar around 4am.</p>

<p>Tensions reportedly escalated when Pankow made a 'rude comment' toward Spielberg, prompting her to get angry and throw objects at him.</p>

<p>Authorities did not disclose what type of objects were allegedly launched at Pankow, but one object struck his hand and left a visible injury.</p>

<p>Mikaela (pictured in mugshot) was first arrested in February and charged with domestic assault causing bodily harm against Chuck Pankow, her 47-year-old ex-fiancé</p>

<p>Mikaela and Pankow (left to right) had reportedly gotten into an argument one night in Nashville, Tennessee, after returning home from  a bar </p>

<p>It resulted in dried blood on his hand, a swollen wrist and marks on the skin. Officers later said the injuries appeared fresh and recent.</p>

<p>Both Mikaela and Pankow admitted the dispute to authorities when they arrived at the scene. It's unclear who called Nashville police.</p>

<p>Although authorities indicated that Mikaela was the aggressor in the alleged exchange, Pankow repeatedly labeled it as a a 'misunderstanding.'</p>

<p>Pankow refused to prosecute over the alleged domestic assault, but authorities prosecuted Mikaela on his behalf.  </p>

<p>The arrest came just weeks after Mikaela announced that she was pursuing a career in the adult entertainment industry. </p>

<p>Now, court documents show that the case was officially dismissed on September 1 by Judge Gale Robinson in Davidson County.</p>

<p>Mikaela (left) maintained her innocence throughout the incident and Pankow (right) labeled the incident as a 'misunderstanding'</p>

<p>In a statement on Instagram, Mikaela said she 'was never aggressive, I was never violent, I was never a body or thing to be feared. Never a beast or an animal, just a flower someone wanted to step on'</p>

<p>Mikaela, who maintained her innocence after the arrest, shared a photo of her mug shot on Instagram and a statement expressing her relief over the dismissal. </p>

<p>'My mugshot…Lets talk about my mugshot,' wrote Mikaela, according to The Sun. </p>

<p>'I was never aggressive, I was never violent, I was never a body or thing to be feared. Never a beast or an animal, just a flower someone wanted to step on.</p>

<p>'I was frightened and had been threatened before. All I desire in the world is softness.</p>

<p>She suggested that her 'wrongful arrest' was executed because of her new career in the adult entertainment industry. </p>

<p>'Today it's over. I finally get to exhale. My only question is why aren't we talking about women who are targeted for being sex workers,' wrote Mikaela.</p>

<p>'My recovery from the trauma of wrongful arrest will take months. Maybe even years …but today it's hats off to the CO who saw sweetness in me… I hope you're reading this.</p>

<p>'My only hurt is that it seemed the men in my community weren't asking the questions 'How is Mika and where is Mika </p>

<p>'Why someone didn't think 'Maybe those involved don't have good intentions for her' is still painful.'</p>

<p>Mikaela, pictured with Steven Spielberg (left): 'Someone tried to make money off a black woman's extreme vulnerability and all I heard was silence, even applause for the fact that I'd lost part of my ability to connect with others for stability'</p>

<p>Her statement also addressed the domestic assault charges, adding: 'I understand that male victims of DV [domestic violence] need to be believed but taking that political frustration on the innocent is where the line needs to be drawn.</p>

<p>'Someone tried to make money off a black woman's extreme vulnerability and all I heard was silence, even applause for the fact that I'd lost part of my ability to connect with others for stability.' </p>

<p>Mikaela, the adopted daughter of director Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, told The Sun that she entered the industry to find better ways to 'capitalize on her body' after more traditional jobs weren't 'satisfying her soul.'</p>

<p>'My safety has always been a number one priority for them,' she said, while revealing that she broke the news to Spielberg, 73, and Capshaw, 66, via FaceTime over the weekend.</p>

<p>'I'm doing this, not out of an urge to hurt anybody or be spiteful about it, I'm doing this because I want to honor my body in a way that's lucrative.'</p>

<p>A self-described 'sexual creature,' Mikaela said her new career gave her confidence and empowerment after she suffered abuse at the hand of 'predators' as a child, which later sparked a series of mental health issues.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, Mikaela has struggled with anorexia, borderline personality disorder, and alcoholism, all of which she says are the result of childhood sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Pictured (left to right): Mikaela Spielberg, Steven Spielberg, Drew Barrymore and Sasha Spielberg at the Los Angeles premiere of "Whip It" at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre on September 29, 2009</p>

<p>Mikaela (pictured), who has only completed solo videos so far, said she told Steven and Kate about her new career over FaceTime </p>

<p>Thus far, Mikaela has only worked on solo videos, which she self-produced and then published on popular free porn website PornHub.</p>

<p>However, she has since removed her clips because she wants to obtain her Tennessee adult entertainment permit before sharing any more content.   </p>

<p>She claimed in March that her father was 'not surprised' by her entry into adult entertainment because he expected her to do 'taboo art.' </p>

<p>'My parents - despite what people have written - aren't embarrassed, they were actually kind of expecting it to be my career... some sort of outsider art... or taboo art, because they've always known that I was a little bit neurotic,' she told The Sun.</p>

<p>'That's not to say all performers are neurotic...just the kind of performer I am - they've always known that whatever I wanted to do in life I probably was going to do it whether they liked it or not.' </p>

<p>'My mugshot…Lets talk about my mugshot.</p>

<p>'I was never aggressive, I was never violent, I was never a body or thing to be feared.</p>

<p>'Never a beast or an animal, just a flower someone wanted to step on.</p>

<p>'I was frightened and had been threatened before.</p>

<p>'All I desire in the world is softness.'</p>

<p>'Why I was left out of the conversation about what it means to be pro heaux, I may never understand.</p>

<p>'I may never understand this man who arrested me. His dreams, his hopes, his anxiety so plainly projected on to my body.</p>

<p>'Today it's over. I finally get to exhale. My only question is why aren't we talking about women who are targeted for being sex workers.</p>

<p>'My recovery from the trauma of wrongful arrest will take months.</p>

<p>'Maybe even years …but today it's hats off to the CO who saw sweetness in me… I hope you're reading this.</p>

<p>'You zipped up my coat and said 'I want you to do well, good luck, the mother in me is hurting for you and telling me to zip your coat up'.'</p>

<p>'My case was dismissed today. I'm sitting down wondering why I wasn't included in dialogue about power dynamics and the frightening truth that all it takes is one person who feels you don't deserve happiness and freedom to take half a year from you.</p>

<p>'I obviously in my life have not been the perfect target. The state did something good today, restoring my faith in people's ability to see gentleness where it is often most denied and stepped upon.</p>

<p>'My only hurt is that it seemed the men in my community weren't asking the questions 'How is Mika and where is Mika.'</p>

<p>'Why someone didn't think 'Maybe those involved don't have good intentions for her' is still painful.</p>

<p>'There's a difference between having a victim complex and routinely communicating to your family and friends that you knew someone at a later date would threaten your income, your safety and security.</p>

<p>'I felt like questions that should have been asked about the possibility of my arrest being linked to economic sabotage weren't at all asked.</p>

<p>'Why people so eagerly commented on threads like I was deserving of having a conservatorship filed because of a consensual choice to join the adult industry.</p>

<p>'I understand that male victims of DV [domestic violence] need to be believed but taking that political frustration on the innocent is where the line needs to be drawn.</p>

<p>'Someone tried to make money off a black woman's extreme vulnerability and all I heard was silence, even applause for the fact that I'd lost part of my ability to connect with others for stability.</p>

<p>'I either have a choice now to break out the lingerie and go for my dreams or to stay stuck in the trauma people with too much power have carefully planned for me.</p>
