        <p>She announced days ago that she'd completed the lyrics on a song started by her late husband Nick Cordero to celebrate wedding anniversary on September 3.</p>

<p>And Amanda Kloots had another surprise musical connection to her husband when she learned that FINNEAS' new single What They'll Say About Us was written with her husband's COVID-19 battle in mind.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old dancer took to her Instagram Stories on Wednesday evening to record an emotional response to the moving ballad.</p>

<p>Moving: Amanda Kloots, 38, shared a tearful video Wednesday on her Instagram Stories after learning that FINNEAS' new song What They'll Say About Us was written about her late husband Nick Cordero</p>

<p>Amanda had previously shared a photo of the single artwork to her Insta Stories before learning about its connection to her and Nick.</p>

<p>Amanda appeared in a follow-up video in a white shirt and a pale peach hoodie with her blonde hair tied back in a ponytail.  </p>

<p>'Whoa guys — quite emotional over here,' she began, before calling FINNEAS' song 'so beautiful.'</p>

<p>'He just shared with me that he wrote it because it was inspired by Nick and Elvis and I. Crazy,' she continued. </p>

<p>Already a fan: Amanda had previously shared a photo of the single artwork to her Insta Stories before learning about its connection to her and Nick</p>

<p>Tearing up: 'Quite emotional over here,' she began, before calling the song 'so beautiful.' She said: 'He just shared with me that he wrote it because it was inspired by Nick and Elvis and I'</p>

<p>Emotional: Amanda was momentarily speechless after saying how moved she was by the song's final lines: 'I wish you could see him/He looks just like you,' which seemed to reference Nick and their son Elvis</p>

<p>'I'm such a big fan, but it's just the most beautiful song,' she continued.</p>

<p>Amanda was momentarily speechless after saying how moved she was by the song's final lines: 'I wish you could see him/He looks just like you.'</p>

<p>The lyrics seemed to reference her and Nick's son Elvis, who was less than a year old when the actor entered the ICU with COVID-19.</p>

<p>'I just keep listening to it and crying harder, but it's good tears,' she said as she broke into a wide smile, before again calling it 'just the most beautiful song.'</p>

<p>Winning team: FINNEAS is best known for writing or co-writing every song on his younger sister Billy Eilish's album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?; shown in February</p>

<p>Saying goodbye: Nick died at age 41 on July 5 following a 95-day stay in the intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA after contracting COVID-19</p>

<p>Nick died at age 41 on July 5 following a 95-day stay in the intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>After being diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, he was placed on a ventilator and had to undergo dialysis. In April, his left leg was amputated. </p>

<p>Amanda later revealed that Nick had overcome the virus, but his lungs had been too severely damaged for him to recover.</p>

<p>Last year, FINNEAS released the EP Blood Harmony, but he's best known for his collaborations with his younger sister Billie Eilish.</p>

<p>He wrote or co-wrote every song on the singer's massively popular album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, which earned him five Grammys, including the prestigious Album of the Year award. </p>

<p>Musical life: In a follow-up text post, Amanda wrote that, 'Music is healing. Music is inspiring</p>

<p>In a follow-up text post, she wrote that, 'Music is healing. Music is inspiring.</p>

<p>'I challenge you to turn on music instead of the TV for a whole day and tell me you don't feel better. Your mood improved,' she wrote. </p>

<p>In a press release, FINNEAS revealed that he began writing What They'll Say About Us after attending a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles in June.</p>

<p>'During that time, I’d also been following Amanda Kloots as she documented her husband Nick Cordero’s time in the ICU while in a coma after being admitted for COVID-19,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'Imagining her sitting by his side, waiting, hopeful for him to wake up, it got me thinking about all the millions of people, all over the world, who also have loved ones, parents, children and extended family members going through the same thing. Fighting this horrific virus. Some will overcome and wake up again, while others, tragically may not,' he continued.</p>

<p>'This song is dedicated to all who have had to endure this year. I hope this song can offer some sort of comfort to those who may need it.'  </p>

<p>Inspired: 'I’d... been following Amanda Kloots as she documented her husband Nick Cordero’s time in the ICU while in a coma after being admitted for COVID-19,' FINNEAS wrote in a press release; shown in February</p>

<p>Big day: Shortly after her first video, Amanda returned to her Insta Stories to announce that Thursday, September 3, would be her and Nick's wedding anniversary</p>

<p>Shortly after her first video, Amanda returned to her Insta Stories to announce that Thursday, September 3, would be her and Nick's wedding anniversary.</p>

<p>The couple had an intimate ceremony on top of a building in Time Square in New York City, before retiring to their room at the Plaza Hotel.</p>

<p>'Even though we're not Jewish, I did the thing where you tap him on the back and he turns around and sees you before the wedding, just because I love that tradition and I think it's beautiful,' she said.</p>

<p>'It was the perfect wedding. Everything went so well,' she continued. 'We danced all night.'</p>

<p>Everything she wanted: 'It was the perfect wedding. Everything went so well,' she continued. 'We danced all night,' she said, while showing photos from the big day</p>

<p>Amanda also said she had an elaborate dance choreographed for their first dance as a married couple, which required a costume change and a new dress.</p>

<p>'We said we would dance that dance every year, so I'll have to try and remember it and do my part tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Amanda said she planned to go to the beach on Thursday to boost her mood, while also remembering her late husband.</p>

<p>'I'm actually to distribute some of Nick's ashes in the Pacific Ocean because that is where some of his dad's ashes are, so I thought it would be a beautiful thing to do.</p>

<p>Afterward, she planned to have friends over for dinner.</p>

<p>Amanda capped off her videos with a touching display of her wedding book featuring photos from the big day, including shots of her and Nick getting ready.</p>

<p>She ended with a picture of herself coming up to Nick from behind, before tapping him so he could see her for the first time on their wedding day.</p>

<p>New traditions: 'Even though we're not Jewish, I did the thing where you tap him on the back and he turns around and sees you before the wedding, just because I love that tradition and I think it's beautiful,' she said</p>
