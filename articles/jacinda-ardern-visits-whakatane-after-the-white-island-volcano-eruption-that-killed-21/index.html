    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Jacinda Ardern has made a special visit to a small New Zealand community devastated by the White Island volcano disaster.</p>

<p>A total of 21 people, including 14 Australians, were killed when the volcano erupted on the island on December 9 last year.</p>

<p>Many were holidaymakers on a cruise visiting the iconic attraction with their families, before their lives were ripped apart in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning the New Zealand Prime Minister made her first visit since the disaster to Whakatane, the seaside town just 50km away from the island.</p>

<p>Jacinda Ardern on Wednesday visited Whakatane, the closest town to White Island for the first time after the deadly volcano eruption</p>

<p>Ms Ardern (pictured in the town) made the heartfelt visit to the community on Wednesday and spoke with many of the first responders</p>

<p>The volcano on White Island erupted on December 9 (pictured) and left 21 dead including 14 Australians</p>

<p>Ms Ardern met for morning tea with a series of workers who were first at the scene and who witnessed the horror unfold.</p>

<p>These included Ngati Awa, the local Maori community, as well as helicopter pilots, coast guard, St John's ambulance workers and staff at the Whakatane Hospital.</p>

<p>But despite the heartache felt across the community, Ms Ardern said she received letters from many who still thought of Whakatane fondly.</p>

<p>'In the aftermath of Whakaari I received a lot of letters from those who had lost loved ones, particularly those who were overseas. Many of those came from our Australian friends,' she said. </p>

<p>'I was deeply moved by those letters.</p>

<p>'In a circumstance where it would be completely understandable to feel such pain and grief when you think of New Zealand and when you think of Whakatane, yet the opposite was true.</p>

<p>'Those letters often detail the close connection that they feel here to this place, and to all of you.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern is seen with Whakatane Mayor Judy Turner (pictured, left) during a morning tea on Wednesday</p>

<p>The prime minister bumped elbows with an occupational therapist on Wednesday (pictured).  She also met with other medical staff and helicopter pilots involved in the volcano disaster</p>

<p>'And in some cases they even said that if they were to lose a loved one anywhere, this is the place that they would want to be safe and held and cared for.</p>

<p>'That in my mind has happened as a result of the way you responded.' </p>

<p>Tamsin Davies, the clinical lead at Whakatane Hospital's emergency department, held back tears as she remembered the traumatic days that followed the eruption.</p>

<p>She said dozens of victims presenting with horrific burns and internal injuries remained 'incredibly' etched on her memory.</p>

<p>'You wouldn't be human if it wasn't,' Dr Davies said.</p>

<p>'It's not just us as the hospital staff that it will have a lasting effect on, I think it's the country.</p>

<p>'I have incredible pride in our team, and how everyone helped each other and helped all of the casualties that we had.'</p>

<p>Dave van Dyke, a registered nurse and Whakatane Hospital coordinator, said the town would always remember the Australian medics who flew to NZ for support.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern (pictured, with locals) said it was heartwarming to see how the community came together in the wake of the volcano eruption</p>

<p>'We had a number of nurses that came across after the event and they were a vital part of our support, and part of our recovering the days after the event as well. For that we're extremely grateful,' he said.</p>

<p>A number of inquiries - including a multi-million dollar WorkSafe probe - have been launched into the disaster.</p>

<p>There were 47 people on the island when its volcano erupted, with those lucky enough to make it out alive carrying painful scars and lifelong disfiguring. </p>

<p>Trips out to the island once brought in more than $4million a year but it is now deserted, with the layers of ash a reminder of the disaster.  </p>

<p>Stephanie Browitt (pictured) suffered burns to 70 per cent of her body in White Island eruption</p>

<p>Ms Browitt took an image of smoke on the volcano just moments before it erupted killing her father and sister</p>

<p>The eruption trapped tourists on the island, many unable to outrun the plumes of acidic gas and ash that surrounded them.</p>

<p>Some saw their entire families wiped out, others suffered excruciating burns to nearly all of their bodies and many have undergone dozens of surgeries or been placed into long comas.</p>

<p>Among the list of victims was Melbourne father Paul Browitt and his 21-year-old daughter Krystal. </p>

<p>His 23-year-old daughter Stephanie received third degree burns to 70 per cent of her body and lost a number of her fingers. </p>

<p>She was one of the few survivors who was airlifted off the island by a rescue helicopter. </p>

<p>24 Australians were among 47 tourists on New Zealand's White Island when it erupted.   </p>
