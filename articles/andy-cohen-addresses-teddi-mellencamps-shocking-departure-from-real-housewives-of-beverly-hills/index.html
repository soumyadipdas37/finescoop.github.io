        <p>Teddi Mellencamp recently confirmed that her Bravo contract 'was not going to be renewed' for season 11 of the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills. </p>

<p>And Andy Cohen addressed the 39-year-old reality star's shocking departure and praised her for her 'no BS' confirmation on his SiriusXM radio show on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'Teddi Mellencamp released what I thought was one of the most, no BS. I'm leaving announcements on record,' began the 52-year-old talk show host, before playing Teddi's audio for his listeners.  </p>

<p>Andy Cohen addressed Teddi Mellencamp's shocking departure from RHOBH and praised her for her 'no BS' confirmation on his SiriusXM radio show on Wednesday</p>

<p>In her official announcement, posted to Instagram on Tuesday, Mellencamp that she was 'sad' that her contract was not going to be renewed because she formed such strong bonds with the show's cast and crew.</p>

<p>She also noted that as a Housewife 'you get to do incredible things that you probably never get to experience without the show.'</p>

<p>Although the wound was still fresh, Teddi said that she is 'really looking forward to the future and being able to focus on [her family and friends],' as well as her coaching program All In.</p>

<p>'I really feel like I have some exciting things ahead.' </p>

<p>Teddi appeared on the show for three seasons after joining in 2017. The 10th season came to a close earlier this week with the final reunion show.</p>

<p>After taking in Mellencamp's words, Cohen remarked: 'That was really good. That was good.'  </p>

<p>'I have to say it's so wild when you, everyone has just been through it. The year, like it's not many people for whom this year has been a good year, but she had, I mean, she has had some major health stuff with her kids.'</p>

<p>Andy was referencing to Teddi's seven-month-old daughter Dove who was diagnosed with Lambdoid Craniosynostosis and had to undergo neurosurgery in July, as well as her son Cruz, five, who broke his thumb during a bike ride shortly after his little sister's surgery. </p>

<p>He continued: 'So I really, you know, I was, I was watching that thinking, wow, she's been through it health wise with her kids.'</p>

<p>No BS: 'Teddi Mellencamp released what I thought was one of the most, no BS. I'm leaving announcements on record,' began the 52-year-old talk show host, before playing Teddi's audio for his listeners; Teddi pictured on Tuesday</p>

<p>Sadness: In her official announcement, posted to Instagram on Tuesday, Mellencamp that she was 'sad' that her contract was not going to be renewed because she formed such strong bonds with the show's cast and crew</p>

<p>Aside from giving his two cents on Teddi's exit, the Watch What Happens Live host also made sure to address the 'whole controversy online' about Mellencamp's All In program and the speculation that it led to her dismissal.</p>

<p>'Well, well, I just want to, I want to say people are speculating that the online chatter about her business led to her dismissal. And I just want to say, because I think it's important that one had absolutely nothing to do with the other. And I actually would have liked to see her respond to her critics on the show. I would have liked to have seen that,' explained Cohen.</p>

<p>All In by Teddi is a weight loss program that is heavily reliant on the idea of 'accountability' and is aimed at those looking to lose weight and maintain it. </p>

<p>Alleged former clients of Teddi's program have come forward with their experiences, shared by influential Instagrammer Emily Gellis, claiming that they were initially restricted to approximately 500 calories while being required to do a daily hour of cardio. </p>

<p>Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills: Teddi appeared on the show for three seasons after joining in 2017. The 10th season came to a close earlier this week with the final reunion show; Garcelle Beauvais, Denise Richards, Lisa Rinna, Kyle Richards, Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley, and Teddi Mellencamp pictured in 2019</p>

<p>'I know nothing by the way about her business, but I will say that Jeff Lewis and team, um, I actually, I was tuning in the other day and they were talking about it. I remember them saying this, they went through the all-in program and they did not have bad things to say about it,' said Cohen in regards to what he has heard about the All In program.</p>

<p>'She, they, I think they said they were hungry, but, um, he said that that, that program taught him how to order food in restaurants. And so anyway, listen, listen to the clip of Jeff talking about the program. </p>

<p>'So I don't know, I've never done it. I don't know anything about it. Um, but I did just want to clear that up. And of course I wish her well and I like, I liked that announcement,' he concluded. </p>

<p>Tough times: 'I have to say it's so wild when you, everyone has just been through it. The year, like it's not many people for whom this year has been a good year, but she had, I mean, she has had some major health stuff with her kids,' said Andy in reference to Teddi's daughter Dove and son Cruz; the duo pictured in July</p>

<p>All In controversy: Aside from giving his two cents on Teddi's exit, the Watch What Happens Live host also made sure to address the 'whole controversy online' about Mellencamp's All In program and the speculation that it led to her dismissal; Teddi pictured on September 15</p>

<p>DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that Teddi was set to be axed from the Bravo show, just one day before she took to Instagram to confirm the news for herself.</p>

<p>A production insider previously told DailyMail.com: 'Teddi will be advised this week that she will not be picked up for another season.' </p>

<p>'The network has not been impressed with her performance on the show,' the insider continued. 'They considered cutting her last season but gave her one last chance.’</p>

<p>'She is boring and stale and does not offer anything to the franchise with her robotic and staged delivery when interacting with the other cast members.'</p>

<p>Allegations: Alleged former clients of Teddi's program have come forward with their experiences, shared by influential Instagrammer Emily Gellis, claiming that they were initially restricted to approximately 500 calories while being required to do a daily hour of cardio; Teddi pictured</p>

<p>'The issue is, the other cast members don't particularly like her and beyond Kyle [Richards] no one is friends with her,' the insider alleged. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Denise Richards, who is married to Aaron Phypers, recently announced she won't be returning to Real Housewives of Beverly Hills after two seasons.</p>

<p>Accusations the Wild Things actress had an affair with Brandi Glanville became key focus last season despite her efforts to have the storyline scrapped via a cease and desist.</p>

<p>Newcomer Garcelle Beauvais along with show veterans Lisa Rinna, Kyle Richards, Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley are expected to return.</p>
