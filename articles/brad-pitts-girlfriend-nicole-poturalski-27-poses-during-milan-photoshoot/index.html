<p>On shoot: Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski was spotted on a photoshoot in Milan, Italy, on Thursday after the actor and his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston reunited on screen</p>

<p>For her photoshoot in Milan, Nicole cut a casual figure in double denim opting for high-waisted mom jeans and an oversized jacket.</p>

<p>The mother-of-one finished her look with a coral orange T-shirt, cream jumper, canvas bag and beige trainers. </p>

<p>Nicole styled her caramel coloured locks into a sleek straightened hairdo and added a slick of make-up, which included smokey eye shadow. </p>

<p>The model appeared in good spirits as she greeted her friends and colleagues at an outdoor eatery in Milan. </p>

<p>Busy bee: The model, 27, was seen arriving at a bar and restaurant in the city as she greeted some of friends and colleagues</p>

<p>Together again: It comes as Brad, 56, and Jennifer, 51, reunited on screen on Thursday night to perform a risqué topless scene during a star-studded virtual table read of 1982 movie Fast Times At Ridgemont High</p>

<p>Nicole was then seen posing up a storm on a motorbike inside the restaurant, which had large glass doors opened outside, in what appeared to be test shots.</p>

<p>The model also took to her Instagram to document her day as she shared a selfie of herself in a car wearing a facemask amid the Covid-19 crisis and later a video of herself waving on a commercial plane.</p>

<p>It is not known whether she was jetting into Milan or travelling back to her home in Berlin, Germany, in the clip. </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Nicole hit back at trolls accusing her of of 'hating' Brad's ex-wife Angelina Jolie and said people should 'stay out' of her relationship after she shared a cryptic quote saying 'happy people don't hate'. </p>

<p>Casual: For her photoshoot in Milan, Nicole cut a casual figure in double denim opting for high-waisted mom jeans and an oversized jacket</p>

<p>Details: The mother-of-one finished her look with a coral orange T-shirt, cream jumper, canvas bag and beige trainers</p>

<p>Natural beauty: Nicole styled her caramel coloured locks into a sleek straightened hairdo and added a slick of make-up, which included smokey eye shadow</p>

<p>Happy: The model appeared in good spirits as she greeted her friends and colleagues at an outdoor eatery in Milan</p>

<p>It comes as Jennifer and Bra had to recreate one of Fast Times At Ridgemont High's  most risque scenes, where Jennifer's character walks in on Brad's character 'daydreaming' about her topless in the bathroom as she looks for Q-tips.   </p>

<p>The actor took on the role of Brad Hamilton, originally played by Judge Reinhold, 63, while his ex-wife Jennifer, 51, played high school 'sex queen' Linda Barrett, portrayed by Phoebe Cates, 57, in the coming-of-age teenage dramedy.</p>

<p>Jennifer wore a red bikini top over a white tank top for the scene during the live virtual table read and Brad brought a pirate hat for his character's fast-food restaurant employee costume. </p>

<p>Also taking part in the table read for CORE Response coronavirus charity, were Sean Penn - who played Jeff Spicoli in the original, Julia Roberts, Henry Golding, Matthew McConaughey, John Legend, Jimmy Kimmel, Shia LaBeouf and Morgan Freeman.</p>

<p>Work it: Nicole was then seen posing up a storm on a motorbike inside the restaurant, which had large glass doors opened outside, in what appeared to be test shots </p>

<p>Fleeting visit: The model appeared to be jetting straight to the airport as she carried a canvas tote bag and jumper </p>

<p>Friends: Nicole appeared delighted to be catching up with her model pals and colleagues </p>

<p>Sweet: At one stage, Nicole greeted one of her friends with a hug </p>

<p>Reading the script virtually from their homes, legendary actor Morgan, 83, narrated the scene as he described Linda as 'gorgeous', he read: 'Her eyes are filled with desire as she says...' </p>

<p>To which Jennifer as Linda awkwardly said: 'Hi Brad, you know how cute I always thought you were. I think you're so sexy. Will you come to me?'</p>

<p>Brad started laughing as he looked down while the rest of the star-studded cast were left giggling. </p>

<p>Morgan then narrated: 'She reaches out and grabs him for a kiss, pulling him close... then she pushes him away, so he can watch as she carefully unstraps the top of her bathing suit...' </p>

<p>Chilled: The group enjoyed sitting outside the eatery as they had a catch up together </p>

<p>Stroll: Nicole was seen enjoying a stroll in the city before getting into a parked car </p>

<p>Low-key: The model appeared to rock a low-key look in her double denim ensemble </p>

<p>Cheery: The group appeared in great spirits as they were all reunited together </p>

<p>He added: 'They're just about to fall into passionate love making when we hear...' </p>

<p>To which Jennifer's character Linda broke the daydream and asked: 'Hey Brad, do you have any Q-tips?' </p>

<p>Brad's character then had to hide himself and act 'nonchalant', the actor jokingly shook his head and read: 'Wait, just a minute...'</p>

<p>With Jennifer's character replying: 'Oh God, I'm so sorry... I did not know anyone was in here.'</p>

<p>Work it: Nicole knew how to work her best angles as she sat and posed on the motorbike which appeared to be test shots </p>

<p>Updates: The model also took to her Instagram to document her day as she shared a selfie of herself in a car wearing a facemask amid the Covid-19 crisis</p>

<p>Jet-setter: She later posted a video of herself waving on a commercial plane </p>

<p>To which Brad's character exclaimed: 'Doesn't anybody f**king knock in here!' </p>

<p>The event officially titled Dane Cook Presents Feelin' A-Live Fast Times At Ridgemont High served as a fundraiser for the humanitarian organisation CORE [Community Organised Relief Effort] co-founded by Penn, 60, and REFORM Alliance in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>This is the first time Jennifer and Brad, who split in 2005, have reunited on-screen for years.</p>

<p>Brad famously made a guest appearance on Jennifer's hit TV sitcom Friends in 2001, a year into their marriage.</p>

<p>Setting the scenes: Jennifer wore a red bikini top over a white tank top for the scene during the live virtual table read and Brad brought a pirate hat for his character's fast-food restaurant employee costume with Julia Roberts joining them at one stage </p>

<p>'Tensions have escalated between Brad and Angelina, with family therapy no longer taking place,' a source told Us Weekly. </p>

<p>Tense: Last week it was claimed that 'tensions had escalated' between Brad, 56, and ex-wife Angelina Jolie , 45, with family therapy therapy no longer taking place (pictured in 2015) </p>

<p>The former couple had appeared to reach a cordial understanding about co-parenting their kids, with the Once upon A Time... In Hollywood actor spotted leaving the actress' LA home in June after spending time with the children.</p>

<p>However, UsWeekly claims they are now at odds again over how much time they each get with Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and 12-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. </p>

<p>Eldest child Maddox, 19, is allowed to choose his own timetable and is reported to no longer have any contact with his father.  </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted both Brad and Angelina for comment at the time.  </p>

<p>Hitting back: Earlier this week, Nicole hit back at trolls accusing her of of 'hating' Brad's ex-wife Angelina Jolie and said people should 'stay out' of her relationship after she shared a cryptic quote saying 'happy people don't hate'</p>
