        <p>Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande put on a fierce performance at the 2020 MTV VMAs on Sunday evening - easily stealing the show.</p>

<p>Marking a bizarre return to awards season amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the event was filmed over days at several different locations with production abiding by social distancing guidelines as it aired 'live' </p>

<p>The event was initially tipped to be hosted from Brooklyn's Barclays Center however a change in plans saw the show shifted to pre-records, despite MTV claiming much of the show would remain live. </p>

<p>The showstopping set was a medley of Gaga's songs including 911, Rain On Me, and Stupid Love, from her hit album Chromatica.</p>

<p>Making a statement on abiding by safety guidelines, Gaga, 34, wore a LED face mask throughout her set, as well as Ariana, 27, who wore a black silk mask, as she joined her for their hit For Rain On Me.</p>

<p>Making a statement: Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande perform in face masks at the 2020 MTV VMAs in New York City on Sunday evening</p>

<p>The pair wore similar outfits to that of the video for Rain On Me, which was a big winner on the night. </p>

<p>The performance was kicked off by Gaga under a blanket as she watched a TV, which teased a performance by Britney Spears and N*Sync from an old MTV VMAs event.</p>

<p>She then got up from the couch and began singing the track 911 from her latest album, before Ariana also came on stage with her. </p>

<p>Keeping safe: The duo showed off their face masks while performing their hit song</p>

<p>Singing it out: Ariana belted her notes through a black satin face mask</p>

<p>Sexy: The Chromatica star wowed in a bondage-style outfit</p>

<p>Mother Monster: Gaga wowed in fishnets and leather as she performed a medley</p>

<p>Trailing them in the glam stakes was Miley Cyrus who came out swinging - quite literally - as she performed her song Midnight Sky from a giant mirror ball. </p>

<p>Miley, 27 wore a very skimpy outfit for the performance of the song, which she sang live.</p>

<p>The pop star is known for making a big splash at the event, having previously caused an outcry when she performed in latex bra and pants alongside Robin Thicke back in 2013.  </p>

<p>Pandemic pop: The stars appeared to be making a statement with their face masks</p>

<p>A Star is (Re)Born: Gaga is back to her kook pop roots </p>

<p>Choreo: Gaga's dancers also wore masks as she danced behind her </p>

<p>Quick change: Impressively, the singer was able to switch outfits throughout her performance</p>

<p>Sci-fi: The singer put on a techy display with an LED face mask</p>

<p>This time around, the defiant singer appeared to throw a nod to her racy past as she went from performing the hit song on a stage, to getting on top of a mirror ball. </p>

<p>Showing off her long legs while holding on to a chain, Miley belted out her tune as she put on a spirited performance. </p>

<p>The Weeknd opened the show with a performance of his hit song - Blinding Lights - on the rooftop of the Edge, which is the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere. </p>

<p>Wow: Showing off her long legs while holding on to a chain, Miley belted out her tune as she put on a spirited performance</p>

<p>Red alert: Miley, 27, looked stunning as she took to the stage which was filled with a red-hued filter</p>

<p>Star: Miley is known for making a big impact at the MTV Awards</p>

<p>The Canada-born star came into the night with six nominations including Artist Of The Year, and five for the song's video: Video Of The Year, Best R&amp;B, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Direction by Anton Tammi. </p>

<p>Looking bloodied and bruised to match the cover of his latest studio album After Hours, the hitmaker kicked things off seemingly passed-out, laying on the ground in a pre-recorded clip.</p>

<p>As the intro to the song progressed, The Weeknd stood up to reveal his 1980s-era ensemble of black pants, red blazer and black shirt and tie.</p>

<p>High-flying: The Weeknd opened the 2020 MTV VMAs in New York City with a rooftop performance of his hit song Blinding Lights</p>

<p>Cinematic: The singer-songwriter, 30, performed atop the Edge at Hudson Yards, which is the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere</p>

<p>Battered: The Canadian crooner looked bloodied and bruised to match the cover of his latest studio album After Hours, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200</p>

<p>The impressive visual effect included an array of light towers and images of subway cars behind him.</p>

<p>The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.</p>

<p>This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>Wowser: Doja Cat performs her hit song Say So at the award show</p>

<p>Nude awakening: The rapper wore a Showgirls-style nude body suit with silver detailing</p>

<p>Sultry: The star certainly garnered attention in her revealing outfit </p>

<p>Space age: Doja performed a visually spectacular set on the show</p>

<p>Out of this world: The rapper certainly took her performance to the next level on the show</p>

<p>MTV explained its plans for the show to ‘[span] all five boroughs’ of New York, to ‘pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.’</p>

<p>Nominations this year were dominated by pop performers Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, with nine nods each, while Billie Eilish and The Weeknd followed closely behind with six each.</p>

<p>They all appear in the top prize category, Video of the Year, which finds Eilish's Everything I Wanted going up against Eminem and Juice WRLD's Godzilla, Future and Drake's Life Is Good, Gaga and Grande's Rain on Me, Taylor Swift's The Man, and The Weeknd's Blinding Lights.</p>

<p>Boys: Zabdiel De Jesus, Joel Pimentel, Richard Camacho, Erick Brian Colon and Christopher Velez of CNCO perform at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards at the Skyline Drive-In</p>

<p>Driving force: Richard and Erick of CNCO perform at the VMAs</p>

<p>Here's looking at you: Maluma engaged with the audience, despite there not being a live crowd</p>

<p>Masked ups: It appeared that his backing dancers all wore face coverings for the event</p>

<p>Nominees for Push Best New Artist were revealed on July 23 and other categories were announced on July 30. Fan voting began on July 30 and ended on August 23.</p>

<p>Additional categories were unveiled last week, including Song of Summer, Best Group and Everyday Heroes: Frontline Medical Workers, with the latter created to ‘celebrate performances by Covid-19 first responders.’</p>

<p>Other new one-off award categories this year are for Quarantine Performance and Best Music Video from Home.</p>

<p>Not just the host with the most: Keke Palmer also performed Snack during the show</p>

<p>Wow factor: Keke proved she can do it all by hosting the show and putting in a stellar performance</p>

<p>DaBaby made a Black Lives Matter statement during his set, as he performed on top of a police car. </p>

<p>Replacing the singer Fergie in the band is J. Rey Soul, real name Jessica Reynoso. </p>

<p>She first got involved with the band when she worked with member apl.de.ap on The Voice Philippines. </p>

<p>Calling in: BTS performed from South Korea during the show</p>

<p>The first VMA ceremony was held in 1984 at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, where Madonna performed her hit Like a Virgin wearing her iconic wedding gown/bustier combination.</p>

<p>The Video Vanguard Award has been awarded to 34 acts, and was renamed the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 1991, after he previously won the 1988 trophy.</p>

<p>MTV has stated that next year’s 2021 VMAs will be held at the Barclays Center.</p>

<p>Surprise performance: apl.de.ap, will.i.am, Taboo, and J. Rey Soul of Black Eyed Peas closed the show</p>

<p>Where is the love... for this band? The Black Eyed Peas were a surprise performance for the evening</p>

<p>So 2008 and late: The band brought some nostalgic vibes to the show</p>

<p>Guest: Rapper Tyga also made an appearance on the show</p>

<p>Taking the bull by the horns: Naturally, Gaga went to town when it came to wearing a variety of different masks for the event </p>

<p>Lady Gaga isn't exactly a wallflower when it comes to red carpet events, but at the 2020 MTV VMAs, the superstar singer totally stole the show!</p>

<p>With the help of stylist Nicola Formichetti, she wore looks by the likes of Area, Valentino and Iris van Herpen (and of course some seriously fierce face masks!), but it was this emerald green ensemble by Christopher John Rogers that really made us swoon.</p>

<p>It looks like a ballgown, but it's actually a taffeta skirt and matching top, and we love the voluminous shape and kimono sleeves. The designer is one to watch, and Lady Gaga is joining an elite list of fans - Michelle Obama and Tracee Ellis Ross for starters!</p>

<p>This Autumn/Winter '20 collection look will soon be available exclusively at NET-A-PORTER (click right to be ready and waiting with your credit card), but for now, make them green with envy in a Gaga-inspired gown from our edit below.</p>
