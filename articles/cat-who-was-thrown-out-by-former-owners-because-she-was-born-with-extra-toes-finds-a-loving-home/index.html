        <p>A cat who was abandoned because she was born with extra toes has become a social media star.  </p>

<p>Sansa, a six-year-old snowy cat from New York City, was born with rare condition heterochromia and has two different eye colors - one blue and one green - and extra toes as a result. </p>

<p>But the adorable kitty, with six digits on each front paw, and five and four on her hind paws, was found abandoned by animal rescue staff in New York City earlier this year. </p>

<p>Since then, she's attracted 200,000 fans on social media and now she's finally found a new home. </p>

<p>Her new owner, who only wants to be referred to as Karen, said today: 'Many people have expressed how much they love Sansa’s uniqueness with her different colored eyes and extra toes.' </p>

<p>Sansa, a six-year-old snowy cat from New York City, was born with rare condition heterochromia and has two different eye colors - one blue and one green - and extra toes as a result</p>

<p>Due to her unusual looks, Sansa was thrown out by her former owners and suffers panic attacks as a result</p>

<p>The 33-year-old animal lover, who works with a healthcare consultancy helping patients with serious medical issues such as cancer, says that she did not adopt Sansa for her uniqueness rather she wanted to save her from being confined to a cage as the cat suffered anxiety after being thrown out by previous owners. </p>

<p>'We were informed that her foster desperately wanted her adopted because she was so anxious that she needed to be kept in a carrier at all times,' Karen added. </p>

<p>'My husband and I met Sansa at a cat adoption event in New York City. Even though there were a lot of cute, friendly cats at the event, my eyes kept being drawn to Sansa’s cage who was previously called Snow. </p>

<p>'It was a seemingly empty cage with a sign that said the cat inside suffered from anxiety and had been neglected and eventually thrown out by her previous owners. </p>

<p>The feline's unusual stare has made her very popular on social media where she counts more than 21,000 followers</p>

<p>Look at this face! A social media campaign seen by more than 200,000 scored Sansa a new home </p>

<p>Cute Sansa's new owner, Karen, said she felt an instant connection with the beautiful feline when she arrived home </p>

<p>'Turns out the cage was not empty - she was simply hiding under the cat bed! I felt an immediate connection to her because I suffer from anxiety myself, and I knew that I wanted her to be a part of our family before I even saw her.'</p>

<p>'Imagine my surprise when I realized that she had different colored eyes and extra toes.</p>

<p>While Karen brought Sansa home two days later, it took a long time for Sansa to trust her owners. </p>

<p>She was always fearful and would hide behind the TV console whenever the door opened and only came out for food. It was later found that Sansa also suffered from Feline Hyperesthesia Disorder, a type of anxiety. </p>

<p>Karen said it took Sansa a long time to trust her new owners after being abandoned because of her looks </p>

<p>Sansa enjoying the view in her New York City apartment. The cat was diagnosed with feline anxiety </p>

<p>Karen said that after receiving help for her anxiety and taking feline CBD oil, Sansa is finally the queen of the apartment </p>

<p>Karen added: 'Shortly after she came home, we realized that Sansa exhibited strange behaviors in which her back would 'roll' uncontrollably, followed by her attacking her tail multiple times a day. </p>

<p>'She seemed to be in pain whenever her back rolled and we could not understand why. We had never seen a cat do this before. </p>

<p>'We recorded these episodes to show the vet and after some tests, she was eventually diagnosed with FHS. </p>

<p>Beautiful Sansa worried her loving new owners because she went through panic attacks were she would roll her back and attack her tail </p>

<p>Now kept by a loving family, six-year-old Sansa has learned to relax and trust them around the house</p>

<p>A closer look at Sansa's paws, with count an extra toe. Karen said she got not because of her unique looks, but to give her a home </p>

<p>Looking dapper in her pink bow. Karen started an Instagram account with pictures of Sansa which now counts more than 20,000 followers</p>

<p>'She was put on different drugs but none seemed to be that effective.'</p>

<p>Pet CBD oil has helped curb Sansa’s episodes. </p>

<p>'She has claimed the apartment as her own and is the true queen of our household," her new owner said. </p>

<p>'Queen Sansa wakes us up at 6am every morning to announce that she’s hungry, and if we don’t get up in time, she proceeds to knock things off the nightstand one by one. </p>

<p>'She knows exactly what she needs to do to get her way,' Karen said. </p>

<p>'I started an Instagram account @sansa.thecat because I wanted to document each day of our journey caring for an anxious, genetically different cat. </p>

<p>'What makes her special just makes it a little easier to get people’s attention to raise awareness and advocate for the adoption of special needs cats.'</p>

<p>Sansa's foster home were desperate to find her a home because she was deeply anxious everyday </p>

<p>Snowy beauty. Karen said Sansa wakes up at 6:30am everyday, and expects to be fed immediately </p>

<p>Karen said that if she doesn't get out of bed early enough to feed Sansa, the cat will start knocking things off the nightstand </p>

<p>The pet-lover said Sansa knew exactly what she needed to do to get her way around her family's house </p>

<p>The cat, whose had a rough few years because of her paws, is finally enjoying life thanks to her loving new family </p>
