    <div class="flex-wrap p-4 lg:p-0 md:pb-8 whitespace-pre-line text-sm">
        <p>Donald Trump earned $197 million from appearing on The Apprentice and a further $230 million from deals that followed, tax records show. </p>

<p>The reality TV show and the licensing and endorsement agreements it brought were among his biggest money-makers, The New York Times reported on Monday. </p>

<p>Thanks to a deal he made with producers of the show in 2005 alone, Trump raked in $47.8million because of a deal which entitled him to half the show's profits.</p>

<p>The money handed Trump a financial lifeline, the Times said Monday. He had relied on heavy losses across his business empire to help nearly erase his federal income tax bill, according to the paper's report Sunday. </p>

<p>The details of the tax filings published Sunday complicate Trump's description of himself as a shrewd and patriotic businessman, revealing instead a series of financial losses and income from abroad that could come into conflict with his responsibilities as president. </p>

<p>The president's financial disclosures indicated he earned at least $434.9 million in 2018, but the tax filings reported a $47.4 million loss. Losses in the property businesses solely owned and managed by Trump appear to have offset income from his stake in 'The Apprentice' and other entities with multiple owners. </p>

<p>Trump dismissed the story as 'fake news' at a news conference on Sunday. </p>

<p>Donald Trump earned $197 million from appearing on The Apprentice and a further $230 million from deals that followed, tax records show. He is pictured on the show with son Don Jr. and daughter Ivanka in 2010 </p>

<p>The report shows how in total, between 2000 and 2018, he made $197 million from the show. Licensing deals sprang up afterwards, netting him another $230million. They included $500,000 from Domino's in 2005</p>

<p>He also netted 3.8million from Serta Mattresses in 2013</p>

<p>THE APPRENTICE - $197.3million </p>

<p>In 2005 alone, Trump raked in $47.8million because of a deal which entitled him to half the show's profits. </p>

<p>ENDORSEMENT AND LICENSING DEALS - $230million </p>

<p>$500,000 from Domino's in 2005</p>

<p>$3.8million from Serta Mattresses in 2013</p>

<p>$11million Trump International Hotel Waikiki licensing deal in 2010</p>

<p>$2.9million Trump Towers Istanbul licensing deal</p>

<p>INVESTMENTS - $178million </p>

<p>Trump Tower - $336million in profit between 2000 and 2018</p>

<p>Trump World Tower - $167million in profit</p>

<p>Share in two office buildings owned by Vornado - $176.5million</p>

<p>LOSSES </p>

<p>The golf courses were the most loss-making. </p>

<p>Between 2000 and 2018, the courses reported $315.6millon in losses. </p>

<p>In 2013, Trump National Doral in Miami reported $65.5million in losses. </p>

<p>In 2008 and 2009 - More than $1billion in losses from failure of his Atlantic City casino investments. He used it to claim a $72.9million refund in federal taxes from the previous four years</p>

<p>Bid for presidency announced, costing him Miss Universe and The Apprentice </p>

<p>But it boosted Mar-a-Lago membership and raked in $7.8million in 2016. </p>

<p>WHAT TAX DID HE PAY? </p>

<p>Between 2005 and 2008, he paid more than $70million to the IRS after his exorbitant income from The Apprentice and the endorsements that came with it caught up with him.  </p>

<p>LOANS</p>

<p>More than $300million which he is personally responsible for that he needs to start repaying in the next four years</p>

<p>He has liquidated hundreds of millions in stocks and has less than $1million in his portfolio, according to public financial disclosures</p>

<p>The IRS audit still is not complete. He could we more than $100million from that when it is, according to the Times.</p>

<p>The report shows how  in total, between 2000 and 2018, he made $197 million from the show. Licensing deals sprang up afterwards, netting him another $230million. </p>

<p>They included $500,000 from Domino's in 2005, $3.8million from Serta Mattresses in 2013, $11million from a Trump International Hotel Waikiki licensing deal in 2010 and $2.9million from Trump Towers Istanbul licensing deal. </p>

<p>Trump, who campaigned for office as a billionaire real estate mogul and successful businessman, also netted half a million to sell Double Stuf Oreos and $850,000 to pitch laundry detergent All brand. </p>

<p>Seminars that promised 'the secrets and strategies that have made Donald Trump a billionaire' also made his cash. He made $300,000 at one event speaking in Dayton, Ohio. He earned royalties of of $1.4 million from book Think Big and Kick Ass: In Business and Life. </p>

<p>Trump Tower and Trump World Tower in Manhattan are also money makers. The first made $336million in profit between 2000 and 2018, and the latter made $167million in profit in the same time period. </p>

<p>Trump also has a 30 percent stake in two other office buildings that are operated by Vornado, one of the city's most prominent commercial landlords, which netted him $176.5million.   </p>

<p>All the while his properties were draining money. </p>

<p>The Times report also found that Trump has been feuding with the Internal Revenue Service for the last decade over a nearly $73 million tax refund he previously claimed. If the IRS were to prevail in its audit, which has seemingly stalled in recent years, Trump could be responsible for paying over $100 million to the government. </p>

<p>Apprentice producer Bill Pruitt told The New Yorker in 2018: 'We walked through the offices and saw chipped furniture. </p>

<p>'We saw a crumbling empire at every turn. Our job was to make it seem otherwise.'</p>

<p>Trump had told an NBC producer: 'Even if it doesn’t get ratings, it’s still going to be great for my brand.'</p>

<p>In the two years before The Apprentice Trump had made less than a million in ad campaigns; in the two years after it started that figure reached $5.2 million. </p>

<p>Trump neckties, shirts and underwear netted him $15 million; he took $100,000 from Warner Music to appear on cellphone ringtones.</p>

<p>The president has been aggressive in claiming certain business expenses that further shrank his tax bill, according to the Times. </p>

<p>That includes $70,000 in hairstyling expenses tied to 'The Apprentice,' his former television program, and classifying a New York property described by the Trump Organization as a family retreat as an investment property to write off millions in property taxes.</p>

<p>When Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, The Apprentice was axed by NBC Universal and Miss Universe also cut ties with him. It was a costly move, taking away a chunk of his income. He had been making $2million-a-year from Miss Universe</p>

<p>Trump said on Monday he paid 'many millions of dollars in taxes' and that he had many more assets than debt </p>

<p>The president has frequently pointed to his far-flung hotels, golf courses and resorts as evidence of his success as a developer and businessman. </p>

<p>Yet The Times reported that Trump has claimed $315 million in losses since 2000 on his golf courses, including the Trump National Doral near Miami, which Trump has portrayed as a crown jewel in his business empire. </p>

<p>Likewise, his Trump International Hotel in Washington has lost $55 million, the Times reported.</p>

<p>Trump bought up golf clubs and properties to turn into golf clubs after raking in hundreds of millions of dollars through The Apprentice and endorsement and licensing deals that were associated with it. </p>

<p>They however continue to labor his portfolio of businesses with their losses.  </p>

<p>Thanks to a deal he made with producers of the show in 2005 alone, Trump raked in $47.8million because of a deal which entitled him to half the show's profits</p>

<p>When Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, The Apprentice was axed by NBC Universal and Miss Universe also cut ties with him. It was a costly move, taking away a chunk of his income. </p>

<p>He had been making $2million-a-year from Miss Universe. </p>

<p>However it boosted memberships at Mar-a-Lago, his 'winter White House'. In 2016, the club took in $7.8million in membership fees. </p>

<p>Many signed up enthusiastically with the hope of getting access to the president, who frequents social events at the property.</p>

<p>Trump, who has fiercely guarded his tax filings and is the only president in modern times not to make them public.    </p>

<p>In 2016 and 2017, he paid just $750 in federal income taxes, according to the Times. </p>

<p>In 10 of the previous 15 years, Trump paid no federal income taxes at all. Despite reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in income, Trump effectively erased his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business interests.</p>

<p>The Times reported that Trump appeared to be responsible for $421 million in loans coming due in the next four years. </p>

<p>Trump's lawyer Alan Garten, said that 'most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate'. </p>

<p>He added: 'Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015.' </p>

<p>TRUMP PAID JUST $750 IN TAXES IN BOTH 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>The newspaper said Trump initially paid $95 million in taxes over the 18 years it studied. But he managed to recover most of that money by claiming — and receiving — a stunning $72.9 million federal tax refund. According to the Times, Trump also pocketed $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which are typically based on federal filings.</p>

<p>Trump’s outsize refund became the subject of a now-long-standing Internal Revenue Service audit of his finances. The audit was widely known. Trump has claimed it was the very reason why he cannot release his returns. But the Times report is the first to identify the issue that was mainly in dispute.</p>

<p>As a result of the refund, Trump paid an average $1.4 million in federal taxes from 2000 to 2017, the Times reported. By contrast, the average U.S. taxpayer in the top .001% of earners paid about $25 million annually over the same timeframe.</p>

<p>TRUMP HAS FINANCED AN EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE WITH THE USE OF BUSINESS EXPENSES</p>

<p>From his homes, his aircraft — and $70,000 on hair styling during his television show “The Apprentice” — Trump has capitalized on cost incurred from his businesses to finance a luxurious lifestyle.</p>

<p>The Times noted that Trump’s homes, planes and golf courses are part of the Trump family business and, as such, Trump classified them as business expenses as well. Because companies can write off business expenses as deductions, all such expenses have helped reduce Trump’s tax liability.</p>

<p>MANY OF HIS BEST-KNOWN BUSINESSES ARE MONEY-LOSERS</p>

<p>The president has frequently pointed to his far-flung hotels, golf courses and resorts as evidence of his success as a developer and businessman. Yet these properties have been been draining money.</p>

<p>The Times reported that Trump has claimed $315 million in losses since 2000 on his golf courses, including the Trump National Doral near Miami, which Trump has portrayed as a crown jewel in his business empire. Likewise, his Trump International Hotel in Washington has lost $55 million, the Times reported.</p>

<p>FOREIGN VISITORS HAVE HELPED SUPPORT TRUMP’S PROPERTIES</p>

<p>Since Trump began his presidential run, lobbyists, foreign governments and politicians have lavished significant sums of money on his properties, a spending spree that raised questions about its propriety and legality.</p>

<p>The Times report illustrates just how much that spending has been: Since 2015, his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has taken in $5 million more a year from a surge in membership. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association spent at least $397,602 in 2017 at Trump’s Washington hotel. Overseas projects have produced millions more for Trump — $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey.</p>

<p>TRUMP WILL FACE FINANCIAL PRESSURE AS DEBTS COME DUE</p>

<p>Trump seems sure to face heavy financial pressures from the enormous pile of debt he has absorbed. The Times said the president appears to be responsible for $421 million in loans, most of which will come due within four years. On top of that, a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower in New York will come due in 2022.</p>
