        <p>It was once the height of luxury: a swish private airliner befitting a jet-setting billionaire and VIP passengers including Presidents, Princes and Hollywood superstars.</p>

<p>But exclusive images taken by DailyMail.com reveal how Jeffrey Epstein's infamous Boeing 727, the so-called 'Lolita Express' has fallen into disrepair as it sits mothballed beside a Georgia runway racking up thousands of dollars in storage fees.</p>

<p>In its pomp, the 1969-built plane whisked prominent guests including Bill Clinton, Britain's Prince Andrew and actor Kevin Spacey to exotic locations across the globe.</p>

<p>But federal prosecutors say it was also used by Epstein to shuttle young sex trafficking victims between his sprawling homes in New York, New Mexico, Paris, the US Virgin Islands and Palm Beach, where the dead pedophile owned a waterfront mansion.</p>

<p>Call sign N90JE took its final flight on July 11, 2016, taking off from Palm Beach International Airport at 11:39am and landing at Georgia's Brunswick Golden Isles Airport 51 minutes later.</p>

<p>Since then it has been parked up near a maintenance hangar, slowing corroding in the humid Southern air and costing around $1,000 a month in storage.</p>

<p>When DailyMail.com boarded the dormant jet, we found the once-plush interior, including deep-pile carpets, throw blankets and fluffy pillows, infested with mold and mildew.</p>

<p>There are numerous creepy pointers to its notorious former occupant, including a garish red couch, mirrored walls, monogrammed tissues and a bottle of baby lotion stored in a wood-paneled bathroom.</p>

<p>When DailyMail.com boarded the dormant jet, we found the once-plush interior, including deep-pile carpets, throw blankets and fluffy pillows, infested with mold and mildew. Pictured: Wet wipes, tissues with Epstein's tail number on them, baby power and other toiletries that are now collecting mildew in a cabinet in the plane's bathroom </p>

<p>Mundane items including bedding, toilet paper, water bottles and instant coffee were also reminders that the plane - now badly corroded and virtually worthless - was in regular use as recently as four years ago. Pictured: Baby lotion and some towels in the plane's bathroom </p>

<p>There are numerous creepy pointers to its notorious former occupant, including a garish red couch and mirrored walls (pictured) on the plane </p>

<p> Federal prosecutors say the plane was used by Epstein to shuttle young sex trafficking victims between his sprawling homes in New York, New Mexico, Paris, the US Virgin Islands and Palm Beach, where the dead pedophile owned a waterfront mansion</p>

<p>Mundane items including bedding, toilet paper, water bottles and instant coffee were also reminders that the plane - now badly corroded and virtually worthless - was in regular use as recently as four years ago.</p>

<p>Federal aviation records reveal the aircraft has been unregistered since 2019, meaning it cannot be legally flown, a moot point since its three Pratt &amp; Whitney engines were stripped and sold three years ago.</p>

<p>It's still registered to Delaware-based JEGE Inc., which is named in several lawsuits as a company linked to 66-year-old Epstein, who hanged himself last August while awaiting trial.</p>

<p>The plane is still registered to Delaware-based JEGE Inc., which is named in several lawsuits as a company linked to 66-year-old Epstein, who hanged himself last August while awaiting trial</p>

<p>DailyMail.com understands that the records are out of date, however, and that it's changed hands several times since 2016.</p>

<p>The plane is currently parked up on a ramp belonging to Stambaugh Aviation, an independent jet maintenance firm that has repaired numerous military and civilian aircraft including President Donald Trump's personal Boeing 757 and a 727 belonging to Peter Nygard, another tycoon facing sex trafficking allegations.</p>

<p>The firm's joint owner Mark Stambaugh said he was initially happy to store the aircraft for free because he expected to be doing work on it, but he started charging around $1,000 a month when it became clear nothing was happening.</p>

<p>'As a father of two daughters, I'm not real thrilled with having it here. But I guess an airplane is just an airplane,' Stambaugh told DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>'Somebody needs to come and do something with it or it needs to be scrapped because it's just going to sit here and keep deteriorating.'</p>

<p>Stambaugh said he's owed $11,000 in unpaid storage, a figure dwarfed by the estimated $2 to $3 million he says it will take to make the 51-year-old plane airworthy.</p>

<p>'As a father of two daughters, I'm not real thrilled with having it here. But I guess an airplane is just an airplane,' Stambaugh told DailyMail.com. 'Somebody needs to come and do something with it or it needs to be scrapped because it's just going to sit here and keep deteriorating'. Pictured: The front cabin of the plane with a circular seating area </p>

<p>Stambaugh said he's owed $11,000 in unpaid storage, a figure dwarfed by the estimated $2 to $3 million he says it will take to make the 51-year-old plane airworthy. Pictured: The front lounge behind the cockpit</p>

<p>'The paint is chalking because it's been sitting in the sun for so long. Until it gets to the point where the paint bubbles out you won't see it, but trust me, there's a lot of corrosion on that airplane,' he added.</p>

<p>'Internally, in the belly, when you open that up you're going to find corrosion and other issues as well.</p>

<p>'As far as the interior, given that it's been sitting in this heat for years it's not in bad shape but I don't know that it has any real value.</p>

<p>'There's a lot of mold and mildew. That just happens, it's the southeast.'</p>

<p>It's been frequently reported that Epstein's 727 was given its Lolita Express moniker by curious locals in the US Virgin Islands who would see the warped financier flying into his privately-owned Little St. James Island with numerous young girls.</p>

<p>The reality may be more mundane: the name appears to have been conjured up by tabloid journalists eager for a lurid headline.</p>

<p>In 2015 Virginia Giuffre filed a lawsuit against Epstein claiming that he recruited her as a 'sex slave' at the age of 15, sexually abusing her for years and forcing her to 'entertain' prominent friends on board the jet.</p>

<p>Her alleged abusers include Prince Andrew, as well as Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, whose names appear on flight logs, but both have denied the allegations.</p>

<p>The flight logs also list Bill Clinton as a passenger on the plane on 26 occasions, jetting to locations such as Brunei, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, the Azores, Africa, Belgium, China, New York, and Belgium.</p>

<p>Also traveling regularly with Epstein on the private jet was his alleged madame, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now in custody in New York facing a slew sex trafficking charges for allegedly procuring victims. Pictured: The cockpit of the Lolita Express</p>

<p>Stambaugh Aviation said the 727 jet has been owned by Florida-based World Aviation Services since March. When DailyMail.com contacted the firm's owner he responded: 'I don't want to answer questions. I don't want to get involved'</p>

<p>DailyMail.com published never-before-seen earlier images last month of the 42nd President of the United States receiving a neck and shoulder massage from Epstein victim Chauntae Davies during a stopover in 2002.</p>

<p>Spacey and the comedian Chris Tucker were also part of the same mission to raise awareness about poverty and the AIDS crisis in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Rwanda and Mozambique.</p>

<p>'President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York,' a statement released by his office read.</p>

<p>'In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,' the statement read.</p>

<p>'Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip.'</p>

<p>Also traveling regularly with Epstein on the private jet was his alleged madame, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now in custody in New York facing a slew sex trafficking charges for allegedly procuring victims.</p>

<p>Stambaugh Aviation said the 727 jet has been owned by Florida-based World Aviation Services since March.</p>

<p>When DailyMail.com contacted the firm's owner he responded: 'I don't want to answer questions. I don't want to get involved.' </p>
