        <p>They can make 8500 loaves in an hour at the Allied Bakeries plant in West Bromwich and the smell of fresh bread wafted across the pitch at The Hawthorns before kick off last night. They must have been proud of their local team, too: Chelsea might have spent £250m this summer but after 27 minutes against West Brom, it looked as if they were toast.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard’s expensively assembled new team were 3-0 down and in disarray. Their new skipper, Thiago Silva, had made a calamitous error on his debut to present West Brom with their second goal, their biggest signing Kai Havertz was struggling to adapt to the pace and rhythm of the game and their other high-profile addition, Timo Werner, looked out of place wide on the left.</p>

<p>Chelsea were so lamentable in that opening half an hour that their latest signing Edouard Mendy, the Senegal goalkeeper bought from Rennes for £28m, would have been powerless to do anything to save them. Kepa Arrizabalaga, replaced by Willy Caballero, may have played his last game for the club but as the goals rattled in, he may have felt fortunate to be sitting in the stands.</p>

<p>Tammy Abraham scored a dramatic late equaliser as Chelsea came from three goals down to draw 3-3 against West Brom</p>

<p>Abraham steered the ball in from close range as Chelsea secured an impressive turnaround having been three goals down</p>

<p>Callum Hudson-Odoi, who was introduced as a substitute at the start of the second half, also managed to find the net</p>

<p>This was a West Brom side, after all, that had lost its opening two games 3-0 and 5-2 and had had their manager Slaven Bilic sent off during the defeat to Everton. It is to the credit of Lampard’s side, though, that they had the spirit and the wherewithal to fight back. Lampard made important changes at half time and Havertz became more and more influential.</p>

<p>There have been so many new arrivals at Stamford Bridge that some have predicted surprise stars of last season like Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount might fade from the scene but Mount, Chelsea’s best player, started their second half comeback with a terrific goal and, as West Brom wilted, Abraham was on hand to tap in from close range deep in injury time to salvage a 3-3 draw and a point for the visitors.</p>

<p>The performance will add to the pressure on Lampard to make his summer outlay pay off but it is inevitable that it will take the raft of new arrivals some time to gel. The class of Havertz is obvious but Chelsea are still experimenting with how best to accommodate him. The same applies to Werner. For the first 45 minutes, Chelsea looked unbalanced and out of sorts.</p>

<p>But they have not yet had a chance to incorporate Mendy, Ben Chilwell or Hakim Ziyech into the side and logic suggests that they will get better and better as the season progresses. They can barely be worse than they were in the first half but their resilience, at least, was a good sign.</p>

<p>Caballero had barely touched the ball when West Brom took the lead in the fourth minute. Marcos Alonso cut out a long diagonal ball easily enough but headed it straight to Matheus Pereira. Pereira advanced and played the ball wide to Callum Robinson, who took a touch, and then drilled the ball low past Caballero into the bottom corner.</p>

<p>Alonso’s evening got worse a couple of minutes later when he was booked for pulling back Semi Ajayi as he galloped down the wing. If Kepa’s Chelsea’s career is over, Alonso might not be far behind him in the march to the car park. When Ben Chilwell, the close season signing from Leicester is fit, he will go straight into the side at left back.</p>

<p>Despite their poor start, Chelsea should have been level after 12 minutes. Reece James curled in a perfect cross to the back post but Tammy Abraham could only sidefoot it high and wide as he ran on to it. As the fight for places intensifies, it is the kind of miss he cannot afford.</p>

<p>Not that he was alone in his profligacy. Three minutes later, Mount wriggled away from his marker with a beautiful turn and picked out Timo Werner 12 yards out. Werner met the cross on volley but lifted it just too high and it clipped the top of the crossbar on the way into touch.</p>

<p>Midway through the half, Chelsea fell further behind. Thiago Silva and Mateo Kovacic swapped short passes in Chelsea’s back line and Silva let the return run under his foot. It rolled straight to Robinson, who accelerated towards goal and had time to pick his spot before he rammed a low shot across Caballero and into the far corner for his second goal of the evening. Thiago hung his head.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, West Brom went further ahead courtesy of more poor Chelsea defending. Darnell Furlong was allowed to flick on a corner at the near post and it fell to Kyle Bartley, who was unmarked at the back post. He sidefooted the ball on the half-volley past the helpless Caballero. On the Chelsea bench, Lampard seethed.</p>

<p>The Chelsea boss put Kovacic and Alonso out of their misery at half time and brought on Cesar Azpilicueta and Callum Hudson-Odoi in their place. Less than ten minutes into the second half, it paid off. Azpilicueta took the ball in space on the left and played it inside to Mount, who sidestepped a challenge and lashed a swerving shot past the motionless Sam Johnstone.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes from the end, Chelsea pulled another goal back. Werner played the ball into the path of Hudson-Odoi, Hudson-Odoi played a neat one-two with Havertz and then opened his body to slide a precise shot past Johnstone. Suddenly, Chelsea were pulsing with belief again and West Brom were clinging on.</p>

<p>Chelsea nearly equalised early in injury time when Werner whistled a volley just over the bar but a minute later, they completed their comeback. There was a suggestion of handball against Havertz when a cross was drifted into the box but the ball fell to Mount and when Johnstone could not hold his shot, Abraham was on hand to prod it over the line.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Recap the action as it unfolded below.  </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Thank you for following our coverage of this evening's game. </p>

<p>Frank Lampard commented on two points dropped after the game and was frustrated with the mistakes that his side made. </p>

<p>Speaking post-match, Abraham stressed that Chelsea have to be more switched on defensively if they are to improve. </p>

<p>Lampard will hope that his side can improve in that regard soon.</p>

<p>For West Brom, meanwhile, there were plenty of positives in that performance despite the result, and Slaven Bilic will have hope that his team will be able to stay up.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard will be pleased with Chelsea's second half display but he will certainly be fully aware that there is still much work for his side to do, especially defensively. </p>

<p>Following that result Chelsea are up to sixth in the Premier League, while West Brom are up to 15th. </p>

<p>The game ends level with Chelsea coming from three goals down to get a point.</p>

<p>Callum Robinson's brace put West Brom ahead before Kyle Bartley made it 3-0.</p>

<p>Chelsea improved considerably in the second half, with Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham scoring for Frank Lampard's side. </p>

<p>There were claims that the ball struck Havertz's arm in the build up to that goal but it was allowed to stand. </p>

<p>Heartbreak for West Brom as Tammy Abraham scores late on from close range. </p>

<p>A heroic block from Kyle Bartley as he closed down Werner's effort. </p>

<p>West Brom bring on Sam Field for Pereira. There will be five minutes of added time. </p>

<p>Werner hasn't been heavily involved in this game. He sees his shot saved by Johnstone. </p>

<p>Christensen is booked for a rash challenge on Robson-Kanu</p>

<p>Ajayi makes a potentially vital interception to deny Werner. </p>

<p>Time is starting to run out for Chelsea and West Brom are putting in a determined display as they seek to preserve their lead. </p>

<p>Furlong goes into the book for taking too long to take a throw-in.</p>

<p>A chance for West Brom to extend their lead, with Sawyers sending his effort narrowly wide. </p>

<p>Matty Phillips on for Diangana.</p>

<p>Chelsea make their final change, with Olivier Giroud on for Thiago Silva.</p>

<p>Chelsea get a second, with Hudson-Odoi exchanging passes with Havertz before finishing well. The last 20 minutes will be very interesting indeed. </p>

<p>West Brom make a change, with Hal Robson-Kanu replacing Callum Robinson, whose first half brace could prove significant. </p>

<p>Mount goes for goal again but this time his effort takes a deflection and is easy to deal with for Johnstone. This final half an hour could feel like much longer for West Brom. </p>

<p>Johnstone is alert on this occasion to push Havertz's effort out for a corner. Nothing comes from the resultant set piece. </p>

<p>Chelsea pull a goal back with an impressive strike from Mason Mount. West Brom goalkeeper Sam Johnstone didn't move. </p>

<p>As expected, West Brom have found themselves under a considerable amount of pressure at the start of the second half, but they are defending very well so far.</p>

<p>It's a double change for Chelsea at the start of the second half as Hudson-Odoi and Azpilicueta replace Kovacic and Alonso. Azpilicueta takes the armband. </p>

<p>Frank Lampard knows his side have to improve drastically. Could he turn to his bench at the break? He has the likes of Giroud, Hudson-Odoi and Barkley as substitutes.</p>

<p>It's half-time, and it's been a superb 45 minutes for West Brom, with Callum Robinson hitting a brace and Kyle Bartley also scoring.</p>

<p>Chelsea, in contrast, have struggled, and Lampard will be hugely frustrated with how his side have defended. </p>

<p>Sawyers does well to create space and cuts the ball back for Diangana, but the latter's effort is off target. </p>

<p>If West Brom can get to the break without conceding then they will be hopeful of seeing this through. Abraham sends a wayward effort over the crossbar. </p>

<p>West Brom seem full of confidence now and deserve much praise for their performance so far. Bilic will be wary of Chelsea's quality, though, and will be determined for his side to not switch off. </p>

<p>This is incredible. Kyle Bartley scores West Brom's third goal as Slaven Bilic's side extend their lead. Frank Lampard will be livid. </p>

<p>Reece James goes into the book. </p>

<p>A nightmare for Thiago Silva on his debut as he fails to control the ball and Robinson is there to steal possession before finishing well. </p>

<p>The majority of Chelsea's best attacks are coming down the right flank, with Reece James providing a considerable threat as he pushes forward. </p>

<p>West Brom are under pressure but Kyle Bartley does well to shepherd the ball out of play while being closed down by Werner. </p>

<p>Chelsea are edging closer to an equaliser. Mount does well to find Werner, whose effort strikes the crossbar. </p>

<p>Another opportunity for Chelsea as Reece James swings in a superb cross, but Abraham can't connect with it properly. </p>

<p>Kai Havertz looks to pull Chelsea level and he goes for goal, but Sam Johnstone pushes his effort away. </p>

<p>Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso - who has endured a torrid start to the game - is booked for a clash with Semi Ajayi.</p>

<p>Willy Caballero, who replaced Kepa today, perhaps should have done better there. Odsonne Edouard's introduction to the side cannot come quick enough. </p>

<p>A brilliant start for West Brom as Callum Robinson puts them ahead after just three minutes. Disappointing defending from Chelsea. </p>

<p>The game is underway at The Hawthorns.</p>

<p>The players are out on the pitch with kick-off rapidly approaching. Can West Brom secure a surprise victory or will Chelsea prevail?</p>

<p>'It's the choice on form. Willy came in against Barnsley and kept a clean sheet. Kepa had a difficult time against Liverpool.'</p>

<p>It's a big occasion for West Brom defender Conor Townsend, with the 27-year-old making his Premier League debut in the absence of Kieran Gibbs.</p>

<p>Townsend, who is in his third season at West Brom, will hope that he can thrive against high-quality opponents. </p>

<p>Here are the latest odds ahead of this evening's game, provided by unikrn.</p>

<p>Match odds via unikrnWest Brom 6/1Draw 7/2Chelsea 1/2</p>

<p>First goalscorerTimo Werner - 5/2Tammy Abraham - 3/1Kai Havertz - 11/2Mason Mount - 8/1Callum Robinson - 9/1Grady Diangana - 11/1</p>

<p>Both Teams to ScoreYes - 4/6</p>

<p> </p>

<p>West Brom have faced a tough start upon their return to the Premier League, with Slaven Bilic's side suffering defeats against Leicester and Everton.</p>

<p>Bilic knows that his team will have to be much more resolute defensively if they are to get anything against Chelsea, but the likes of Grady Diangana and Callum Robinson could make an impact. </p>

<p>It will be intriguing to see how Tammy Abraham and Timo Werner combine for Chelsea today. Werner has shown that he likes to often drift out wide, while Abraham's pace could cause problems for the West Brom defence. Lampard will also be looking for a big performance from Kai Havertz, who scored a hat-trick against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup.</p>

<p>West Brom are without Kieran Gibbs, who is missing due to suspension.</p>

<p>West Brom: Johnstone, O'Shea, Bartley, Ajayi, Furlong, Livermore, Sawyers, Townsend, Pereira, Diangana, Robinson.</p>

<p>Subs: Button, Kipre, Field, Harper, Phillips, Edwards, Robson-Kanu.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva captains Chelsea as he makes his Premier League debut. Willy Caballero is in goal, with Kepa on the bench. Tammy Abraham also starts.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Caballero, James, Christensen, Thiago Silva, Alonso, Kante, Kovacic, Mount, Havertz, Abraham, Werner</p>

<p>Subs: Kepa, Azpilicueta, Tomori, Jorginho, Barkley, Hudson-Odoi, Giroud. </p>

<p>Good afternoon and welcome to our live coverage of West Brom versus Chelsea.</p>

<p>We will provide you with all the latest updates from the clash at The Hawthorns. </p>
