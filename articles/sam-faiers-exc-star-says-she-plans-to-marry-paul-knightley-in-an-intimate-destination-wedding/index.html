        <p>Sam Faiers has revealed she's 'really excited' about eventually tying the knot to her partner of five years, Paul Knightley.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the businesswoman, 29, discussed her plans to marry the property developer, 31, in a 'small and intimate destination wedding', similar to her sister Billie's luxurious nuptials in the Maldives last March.</p>

<p>The reality star also spoke about settling into her Surrey home during the nationwide lockdown, her partner's incredible two-stone weight loss and dealing with parent-shamers ahead of the return of ITV's Sam and Billie: The Mummy Diaries on Thursday.</p>

<p>Planning ahead: Sam Faiers has revealed she's 'really excited' about eventually tying the knot to her partner of five years, Paul Knightley, in an exclusive interview with MailOnline</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, the media personality gushed about taking the next step in her relationship with the father of her two children, insisting she's 'looking forward' to having son Paul Jr., four, and daughter Rosie, two, take part in the ceremony.</p>

<p>Confessing she's made plans about her wedding 'in my head' ahead of her boyfriend's proposal, Sam told MailOnline: 'I'm really excited for that time when it comes and I feel like I've got that to look forward to. </p>

<p>'So much has happened since Paul and I got together. In terms of my wedding, I sort of do know what I would like. </p>

<p>'I would want to get married abroad in Europe and I'd want quite a small intimate wedding. I haven't got a planner or anything but you do think about what you'd like!'</p>

<p>'I sort of do know what I would like': The businesswoman, 29, discussed her plans to marry the property developer, 31, in a 'small and intimate destination wedding'</p>

<p>'I just wanted to keep things positive': The TV star also spoke about parenting in lockdown ahead of the return of The Mummy Diaries (pictured with Paul, four, and Rosie, two)</p>

<p>While lockdown has seen many celebrity couples split, the former TOWIE star revealed her and Essex native Paul's relationship is stronger than ever.</p>

<p>The TV star said: 'In episode one of Mummy Diaries, I think Paul says that lockdown can be a make or break for a lot of people and I completely understand where he's coming from. </p>

<p>'Sometimes you don't spend that quality time as a family like before, so I've just loved having dinner as a family and settling into the house. For us, all I kept thinking was this is going to be over in a minute and I just wanted to keep things positive. </p>

<p>'Within six months of being together we started our first business, so working and living together is just normal.'  </p>

<p>Following in her footsteps? The media personalities' sister Billie, 30, tied the knot to Greg Shepherd in front of 95 family members and friends in the Maldives last March</p>

<p> 'I've loved having dinner as a family': While lockdown has seen many celebrity couples split, the former TOWIE star revealed her and Essex native Paul's relationship is stronger than ever</p>

<p>The estate agent stunned fans as he unveiled his toned physique following an eight-week fitness challenge in June.</p>

<p>Blonde beauty Sam confessed Paul put on weight when he became 'comfortable' in their relationship a few years ago, but enthused she's 'so proud' of her man's new and improved lifestyle. </p>

<p>The influencer explained: 'When we met, he was really fit, went to the gym and had a six-pack, but over the years he slowly developed a bit of a dad belly [laughs] - you know what it's like when you get comfortable in a relationship. </p>

<p>'Lockdown happened and he thought there was no excuses. He got a virtual PT everyday and worked out all the time, he still does now and hasn't had a day off in about five months. </p>

<p>Hard work pays off: The estate agent stunned fans as he unveiled his toned physique following an eight-week fitness challenge in June (pictured L after, R before)</p>

<p>'He had a dad belly': Sam confessed Paul put on weight when he became 'comfortable' in their romance a few years ago, but enthused she's 'so proud' of her man's new lifestyle</p>

<p>'He's so committed, lost two stone, strong and mentally much more positive. Exercise lets off these endorphins that just make you happier.'</p>

<p>On how she's battled with body confidence in the public eye, the mother-of-two said she's had to 'put the hours in' to maintain her figure, especially after giving birth to her little girl. </p>

<p>She detailed: 'I was one of those lucky people who didn't really hold baby weight with Paul, but that didn't happen when I had Rosie. I breastfeed Rosie for 15 months - the exact amount of time I did with Paul.</p>

<p>'My body didn't bounce back the second time and I had to put the hours in, exercise and have a healthy diet, which sometimes is just not practical. As a working mum, sometimes you can't plan your meals. </p>

<p>'It's been bit of a rollercoaster': The mother-of-two said she's had to 'put the hours in' to maintain her figure, especially after giving birth to her little girl (pictured pregnant in 2017)</p>

<p>Her secrets: 'I'm obsessed with cycling now and I guess you just have to find something that fits into your busy lifestyle', the blonde beauty said</p>

<p>'It's been bit of a rollercoaster, but in lockdown, I've had time to focus on myself a bit more. I'm obsessed with cycling now and I guess you just have to find something that fits into your busy lifestyle.'</p>

<p>Last month, Sam revealed she's secretly battled cystic acne for two years, a skin condition which left her feeling 'embarrassed'.</p>

<p>'I was so shocked as growing up I had really clear skin and never suffered with acne or hormonal spots', she told us. </p>

<p>On how her skin issues had a negative impact on her self-esteem, the Revive Collagen entrepreneur said: 'I reached my 20s and thought I skipped that stage but it's so common.</p>

<p> 'My confidence wasn't near enough where it should be': The Revive Collagen entrepreneur detailed how her battle with cystic acne impacted her self-esteem</p>

<p>'I used to be so embarrassed about my skin and used to put a lot of make-up on to cover it up. On days when my spots really flared up, my confidence wasn't near enough where it should be. </p>

<p>'Since speaking out about it, I feel like so many people can relate and I wish I spoke about it sooner. There's so many women going through what I've gone through and they've said it's so refreshing to hear my story and make them feel like they're not the only ones.'</p>

<p>Sam and Paul moved out of their Hertfordshire abode and into a £7,000-a-month Surrey home at the beginning of lockdown in March.</p>

<p>On how the family have dealt with relocating, she said: 'It's nice that there's a bit of normality with going back to work. I feel like I'm playing catch-up with lockdown but I'm not complaining.</p>

<p>'It's been a blessing': Sam and Paul moved out of their Hertfordshire abode and into a £7,000-a-month Surrey home at the beginning of lockdown in March</p>

<p>'My style of house would need more character': The model confessed that while her house is 'perfect', she wouldn't consider purchasing the five-bedroom house in the near future</p>

<p>'We just moved to Surrey a few days before lockdown, so I thought the news was dreadful but in the end we thought we'd enjoy ourselves as a family and spend quality time together as this is never going to happen again, hopefully. </p>

<p>'We were able to settle in and take our time with it all. In a way it was a blessing as we were able to unpack and get to know the area, there were no stresses. I don't want to move again just yet, I might wait until next year.'</p>

<p>Confessing she wouldn't consider purchasing the five-bedroom house in the near future, the former glamour model added: 'I wouldn't buy this house though, it's lovely and ultra modern, but my style of house would need a bit more character. </p>

<p>'It's perfect for now though, and I don't want to rush into anything as I don't even know what's going on with the market.'  </p>

<p>Fan favourites: Sam, alongside her older sibling, 30, have won the hearts of the nation by sharing their motherhood journeys on their much-loved TV show</p>

<p>Sam, alongside her older sibling, 30, have won the hearts of the nation by sharing their motherhood journeys on their much-loved TV show. </p>

<p>Admitting their candid nature has left them open to criticism from mum-shamers, Billie, who shares Nelly, six, and Arthur, three, with her husband Greg Shepherd, said: 'There's pros and cons to giving everything and being so open and honest. </p>

<p>'One of the main reasons we believe the show is still running is because we don't hold back and we give it our all, which leaves it open for people to comment and judge. </p>

<p>'I do think people like to see the genuineness of us - we're two completely different families. Although some people might dislike how I parent, it's all part of being different and individual. Everyone's parenting is different.</p>

<p>'I think we always get the odd person who may think your children are behaving like a spoiled brat, but that person probably doesn't have children! I think the more raw we are, people love that and find a sense of normality.' </p>

<p>Sam and Billie: The Mummy Diaries Series 8 starts Thursday 3rd September at 9pm on ITVBe. </p>

<p>'There's pros and cons to being so open and honest': The influencers admitted they've faced criticism over their parenting (pictured with their daughters Rosie and Nelly, six)</p>
