        <p>Britney Spears made a rare sighting in Calabasas, California on Tuesday morning as she went to Starbucks for a fruity smoothie.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old Toxic singer had on a light grey top with shorts and Birkenstock sandals as she was seen heading back to her Mercedes-Benz convertible with a bodyguard in tow.</p>

<p>This comes just a week after she insisted the Free Britney movement is real and not a conspiracy theory as she fights to end her conservatorship.</p>

<p>On the town: Britney Spears made a rare sighting in Calabasas, California on Tuesday morning as she went to Starbucks for a fruity smoothie</p>

<p>The easy breezy late summer look: The 38-year-old Toxic singer had on a light grey top with shorts and Birkenstock sandals as she was seen heading back to her Mercedes-Benz convertible with a bodyguard in tow</p>

<p>Spears dashed from the Starbucks located in a small strip mall back to her imported sports car.</p>

<p>The blonde beauty had her hair pulled back with little makeup on and a face mask.</p>

<p>The mask, which was white with what looked like a pink tongue, was likely worn upside down. </p>

<p>The former teen singing sensation appeared as if she was in a casual mood while in the oversized top and short khaki shorts that revealed a deep summer tan on her toned legs.</p>

<p>Quick Brit: Spears dashed from the Starbucks located in a small strip mall back to her imported sports car. The blonde beauty had her hair pulled back with little makeup on and a face mask</p>

<p>Not quite on right? The mask, which was white with what looked like a pink tongue, was likely worn upside down</p>

<p>The Las Vegas performer added tortoise shell framed sunglasses with mirrored lenses and flashed a red manicure.</p>

<p>Also in place was the dainty gold ring she often wears on her wedding finger. </p>

<p>Her salt-n-pepper haired bodyguard kept is simple in a black T-shirt and jeans with hiking shoes as he wore a surgical mask.</p>

<p>No fuss: The former teen singing sensation appeared as if she was in a casual mood while in the oversized top and short khaki shorts that revealed a deep summer tan on her toned legs</p>

<p>Lockdown look: The Las Vegas performer added tortoise shell framed sunglasses with mirrored lenses and flashed a red manicure</p>

<p>Last week her attorney filed court documents on her behalf in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her legal case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke', TMZ reported. </p>

<p>The viral movement is popular among Britney's fans who believe that the pop star is being held 'hostage' and controlled by her caretakers.</p>

<p>Spears' lawyer filed documents to oppose Britney's dad Jamie's motion to seal parts of his daughters conservatorship case, according to TMZ. </p>

<p>No in the mood for a closeup shot: Once in the passenger seat, Spears slid down so fans could not see her</p>

<p>'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote. </p>

<p>The outlet added that the Toxic singer said that there were 'no medical issues or sensitive issues with her children to protect' and thus no reason to keep it hidden from the public eye. </p>

<p>Britney shares sons Sean Preston, 14 and Jayden James, 13 with ex Kevin Federline.</p>

<p>The legal filing also included the icon's stance on the Free Britney movement, popular among her fans. </p>

<p>The history: This sighting comes a week after she insisted the Free Britney movement is real and not a conspiracy theory as she fights to end her conservatorship. Jamie was appointed as his daughter's conservator in 2008 following her very public breakdown; seen with ex Lynne Spears in 2012</p>

<p>Many fans have been using online petitions, social media posts and even some in-person protests to call for the Womanizer crooner to be released from her conservatorship.</p>

<p>'[Britney] welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans,' her lawyer penned on her behalf. </p>

<p>Spears' dad Jamie, who has been in control of the conservatorship since its inception,has previously tried to shut down the controversial movement as illegitimate. </p>

<p>'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' Jamie told Page Six in August. 'The world don't have a clue. It's up to the court of California to decide what's best for my daughter. It's no one else's business'</p>

<p>The court document stated of Free Britney: 'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public.' </p>

<p>That line seemed to be in direct response to an interview that Britney's dad gave last month in an effort to curtail the movement.</p>

<p>'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' Jamie told PageSix.</p>

<p>Adding: 'The world don't have a clue. It's up to the court of California to decide what's best for my daughter. It's no one else's business.'  </p>

<p>At home: In her last post she said, 'While we are all searching for answers during these uncertain times ….. trying to keep our spirits up ….. I think it is a good time to see all of the good that’s happening around us !!!!!! Specifically I think we should thank all of the nurses …. volunteers …. and heroes in our lives who are truly making a difference in OUR world'</p>

<p>Earlier this summer the Free Britney frenzy reached a fever pitch when a legion of her fans became convinced that her social media videos were old and being shared by her team to try to 'fake' that she is okay.</p>

<p>That prompted Spears to share a sort of proof-of-life post - a date stamped photo  - to assuage the concerned fans and show she isn't locked up and still has access to her phone. </p>

<p>'Just so you guys know these aren't old ... check the date at the top of the 2nd pic!!!!' she wrote in the caption at the time.  </p>

<p>'The fact you need to post the date to prove she's real looks really suspicious...we all know someone's running the account,' wrote one person who wasn't placated by the attempt. </p>

<p>A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing; she has not performed live since October 2018 (Pictured on tour in August 2018)</p>

<p>This latest court filing is part of Britney's ongoing effort to have her father's legal control over career, finances and estate lifted or loosened.</p>

<p>Last month, her lawyers submitted paper work stating she was 'strongly opposed' to her father having control of her estate and finances, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>Instead the singer wishes for her temporary conservator Jodi Montgomery to take on the role permanently. </p>

<p>Jamie was appointed as his daughter's conservator in 2008 following her very public breakdown. However, last year, he stepped aside from the role due to ongoing health issues.</p>

<p>A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing.</p>

<p>She has not performed live since October 2018 when she wrapped up the final legs of her Piece of Me Tour after concluding her Las Vegas residency on December 31, 2017.</p>

<p>Since then, she has been living mainly at her mansion in Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles, with her boyfriend Sam Asghari.</p>

<p>Spears' conservatorship is currently under review by a judge in Los Angeles. </p>
