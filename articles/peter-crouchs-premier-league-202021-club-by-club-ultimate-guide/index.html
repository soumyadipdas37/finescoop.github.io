        <p>The Premier League returns this weekend, as Liverpool begin the defence of their crown following a stunning runaway success last term.</p>

<p>But who will be the teams looking to challenge them for the title, and what else can we expect ahead of the unusually late start to the English domestic season?</p>

<p>Former Premier League striker and Sportsmail's Peter Crouch gives his assessment on every top flight side ahead of the big kick-off. </p>

<p>Sportsmail's Peter Crouch gives his verdict on each club ahead of the Premier League season</p>

<p>Liverpool will head into the new Premier League season looking to keep a grip on their title</p>

<p>Last season: 8th </p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: They really impressed me in the Community Shield against Liverpool last month. I like the fact they have managed to get the winning habit, too, as lifting that trophy — not to mention the FA Cup, when they beat Chelsea — will fill the squad with confidence.</p>

<p>Finally there seems to be excitement around the club again and you can see Pep Guardiola’s influence on Mikel Arteta. He’s tactically-shrewd and has made good signings with Willian from Chelsea and Gabriel from Lille.</p>

<p>Add in a striker like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and they can beat anyone on their day. They are a coming force and will push for a place in the top four.</p>

<p>MAJOR INS</p>

<p>Gabriel (Lille, £23m)</p>

<p>Willian (Chelsea, Free)</p>

<p>Pablo Mari (Flamengo, £7.2m)</p>

<p>Cedric Soares (Southampton, Free)</p>

<p>Dani Ceballos (Real Madrid, Loan)</p>

<p>MAJOR OUTS</p>

<p>Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Roma, free) </p>

<p>Mikel Arteta (Premier League win percentage: 45 per cent) </p>

<p>Masterminded wins over Manchester City and Chelsea to win the FA Cup just months into his managerial career — but must improve league form if Arsenal are to challenge the top four.</p>

<p>Willian</p>

<p>The Brazilian has enjoyed a brilliant career in England, winning pretty much everything at Chelsea. He’s 32 now, but if he can recreate form he showed in west London he will prove an excellent signing.</p>

<p>TITLE ODDS: 33-1 TOP FOUR FINISH: 9-4 RELEGATION: 250-1 </p>

<p>Mikel Arteta is on a high heading into his first full season at Arsenal after lifting the FA Cup</p>

<p>Last season: 17th </p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: My affection for the club who gave me my Premier League debut will never be diluted but, unfortunately, I fear they are in for another season of struggle. </p>

<p>So much depends on Jack Grealish playing well and it is vital he continues the form that won him an England cap. </p>

<p>The big money signing of Ollie Watkins took me by surprise. As much as Watkins impressed me at Brentford, it is a huge fee and it carries huge expectation. Villa spent a lot of money last summer and it only just about paid off. If they stay up again this year, they will have done well.</p>

<p>MAJOR INS</p>

<p>Ollie Watkins (Brentford, £27.7m)</p>

<p>Matty Cash (Nott'm Forest, £14.2m)</p>

<p>Ben Chrisene (Exeter, Undisclosed)</p>

<p>MAJOR OUTS</p>

<p>Ross McCormack (Released)</p>

<p>Borja Baston (Leganes, Free)</p>

<p>Dean Smith (Premier League win percentage: 23.7 per cent)  </p>

<p>Despite huge spending on new players last summer, Villa struggled before a late rally — and good fortune — kept them up. Smith will be under pressure if Villa get off to a slow start.</p>

<p>Jack Grealish </p>

<p>Most goals, most assists and most minutes last season highlighted how vital the playmaker was to their great escape.  If he is still at Villa at the end of the transfer window, they should stay up.</p>

<p>TITLE ODDS: 1000-1 TOP FOUR FINISH: 80-1 RELEGATION: 7-4 </p>

<p>Aston Villa will turn towards star man Jack Grealish to help keep them in the Premier League</p>

<p>Last season: 15th </p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: The fact they have defied the odds and remained in the Premier League, when everyone had them down to be relegated straight after winning promotion, is a credit to the people in charge at The Amex Stadium. </p>

<p>I cannot help but wonder, however, whether this story will run its course over the next nine months. They haven’t spent a lot of money — though Adam Lallana is a shrewd signing — and I worry whether they have enough goals in the team, especially after losing Glenn Murray. </p>

<p>They will continue to play a nice brand of football but you need more than that to survive. They have something to prove. </p>

<p>MAJOR INS</p>

<p>Adam Lallana (Liverpool, Free)</p>

<p>Joel Veltman (Ajax, £900,000)</p>

<p>Jensen Weir (Wigan, £500,000)</p>

<p>Lars Dendoncker (Club Brugge, Free)</p>

<p>Zak Emmerson (Oldham, Undisclosed)</p>

<p>MAJOR OUTS</p>

<p>Anthony Knockaert (Fulham, £10.5m)</p>

<p>Aaron Mooy (Shanghai SIPG, £4m)</p>

<p>David Button (West Brom, £990,000)</p>

<p>Glen Murray (Watford, Loan)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Graham Potter (Premier League win percentage: 23.7 per cent) </p>

<p>Enjoyed an impressive debut season in the Premier League. Beat Arsenal home and away and never looked in danger of the drop after restart.</p>

<p>Lewis Dunk</p>

<p>The England centre back signed a new long-term deal despite interest from bigger clubs and has been a rock at the heart of Brighton’s defence during their rise. </p>

<p>TITLE ODDS: 750-1 TOP FOUR FINISH: 50-1 RELEGATION: 7-2</p>

<p>Brighton enjoyed a solid first season under the management of Graham Potter</p>

<p>Last season: 10th </p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: I said at the end of last season that Jurgen Klopp could not have got Burnley any higher than where Sean Dyche has taken them. The consistent job he has done has been outstanding and it’s incredible, really, that people now just take it for granted that they are top-flight regulars. </p>

<p>But to consolidate that status, the club have got to invest. They have lost Jeff Hendrick to Newcastle, they could lose James Tarkowski and with Tom Heaton having gone to Aston Villa 12 months ago, Dyche has been stripped of some big characters.</p>

<p>I don’t see them being in danger at this stage but they need to support their manager and ensure his outstanding work continues. </p>

<p>MAJOR INS</p>

<p>Will Norris (Wolves, Free)</p>

<p>MAJOR OUTS</p>

<p>Jeff Hendrick (Newcastle, Free)</p>

<p>Joe Hart (Tottenham, Free)</p>

<p>Aaron Lennon (Released)</p>

<p>Ben Gibson (Norwich, Loan)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sean Dyche (Premier League win percentage: 30.5 per cent) </p>

<p>Guided Burnley to another top half finish which is no mean feat given the resources of clubs he is competing against. Could this be his last season at Turf Moor? </p>

<p>Chris Wood</p>

<p>The underrated Kiwi has more to his game than physicality but is always a handful and has formed a formidable strike partnership with Ashley Barnes at Turf Moor. </p>

<p>TITLE ODDS: 1000-1 TOP FOUR FINISH: 80-1 RELEGATION: 11-4</p>

<p>Chris Wood has played a key role in helping Burnley become an established top flight club</p>

<p>Last season: 4th </p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: So Frank Lampard is under pressure after spending £200million, is he? I don’t see it that way. There are times when clubs go on splurges and buy six or seven players but they leave you wondering how they will actually improve. </p>

<p>Not Chelsea, who will easily finish in the top four. Each signing, from Timo Werner and all his promise to Thiago Silva and all his experience, will make this team so much better.</p>

<p>I am excited about how it is all going to work out and would go as far to say as I would buy a ticket to watch them play. I don’t see Chelsea winning the title this year — but that is what they are working towards.</p>

<p>MAJOR INS</p>

<p>Kai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen, £72m)</p>

<p>Timo Werner (RB Leipzig, £48m)</p>

<p>Hakim Ziyech (Ajax, £36m)</p>

<p>Ben Chilwell (Leicester, £50m)</p>

<p>Thiago Silva (PSG, Free)</p>

<p>Malang Sarr (Nice, Free)</p>

<p>MAJOR OUTS</p>

<p>Willian (Arsenal, Free)</p>

<p>Pedro (Roma, Free)</p>

<p>Mario Pasalic (Atalanta, £13.4m)</p>

<p>Nathan (Atletico Mineiro, £2.7m)</p>

<p>Michy Batshuayi (Crystal Palace, Loan)</p>

<p>Ethan Ampadu (Sheff Utd, Loan)</p>

<p>Frank Lampard (Premier League win percentage: 52.6 per cent) </p>

<p>Impressive first season at the Bridge ended in disappointment with defeat in the FA Cup final. Has spent heavily but intelligently and will be expected to improve on last campaign. </p>

<p>Thiago Silva </p>

<p>The veteran Brazilian centre-back can help shore up Lampard’s leaky defence — Chelsea shipped more than any other team in the top half last season. </p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: Given the way things fizzled out for Palace in the games post lockdown, it has been said to me that they are vulnerable and in danger of being relegated.</p>

<p>True, they might not be the most adventurous side around but that’s not a big deal. When you are organised, hardworking and know what it takes to stay in and around mid-table, that is generally where you will end up.</p>

<p>Roy Hodgson will get the results he needs and I can’t wait to see how Eberechi Eze, who they signed from Queens Park Rangers, links with Wilfried Zaha. The 22-year-old is full of promise and you should watch his progress keenly.</p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha </p>

<p>Didn’t quite reach the levels we expect from him last season but the winger is still Palace’s danger man. If he recaptures his best form, Palace will be clear of trouble. </p>

<p>TITLE ODDS: 1000-1 TOP FOUR FINISH: 80-1 RELEGATION: 9-4</p>

<p>Once again, Crystal Palace will be relying on the form of Wilfried Zaha to keep them out of trouble and away from the Premier League's relegation zone</p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: There is a lot of expectation amongst supporters on the back of the three signings they made this month. You can see the lure of Carlo Ancelotti, as Allan, Abdoulaye Doucoure and James Rodriguez have all come to play for him.</p>

<p>Something tells me that it won’t be straightforward though. I can understand why fans are over the moon to have signed Rodriguez from Real Madrid but I think of my experience at Stoke.</p>

<p>We got Jese from Paris St Germain, who had previously been with Real, and thought he was going to be a worldbeater. He was anything but. I hope it works out for Everton but I see them in mid-table again. </p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: One of the results I cheered loudest after lockdown was Fulham’s win over Brentford in the Championship play-off final. Scott Parker is someone I have known for a long, long time right back to the days when we played for England youth teams. </p>

<p>Scotty has done an incredible job to get Fulham back up at the first time of asking but I don’t think he will be under any illusions about the size of the task in front of him to keep them up.</p>

<p>One thing in his favour is that he has a proven Premier League striker in Aleksandar Mitrovic but it remains to be seen about the rest of the squad. They might surprise the doubters and I hope they do.</p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT:  My first game out of the Premier League with Stoke in August 2018 was at Elland Road. We turned up thinking we would be fine but ended up being run all over by Leeds in Marcelo Bielsa’s English debut game.</p>

<p>I remember at one point saying to myself: ‘Who the **** are these?!’ They were brilliant, full of energy and intensity. Bielsa is a class act, his name and reputation known the world over.</p>

<p>He has given the people of Leeds the thing they have craved for 16 years and they will be one of the stories of the season. I believe they will comfortably stay up and can see them taking a couple of big scalps. </p>

<p>The 24-year-old has flourished under Bielsa and was the Championship’s best midfielder last season. Has since been rewarded with an England call-up.</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa ended Leeds United's 16-year exile from the Premier League by guiding them to the Championship title last season</p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: I could only feel sorry for them at the end of last season. If games had not been stopped for three months, I’m pretty sure they would have got the job done and finished in the Champions League places, where they had been since August. </p>

<p>Have they missed their big chance? Well, I don’t think they will finish in the top four this season, particularly as all the big guns have strengthened.</p>

<p>They will definitely be in and around the top six or seven and the goals of Jamie Vardy will continue to be critical. My worry concerns the depth of their squad and how they cope with the demands of the Europa League. </p>

<p>Jamie Vardy</p>

<p>Striker is the Peter Pan of the Premier League. At 33, Vardy is showing no signs of slowing down and, if anything, is getting better with age — winning the Golden Boot.</p>

<p>Despite missing out on the Champions League, Jamie Vardy ended last season as top scorer</p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: Maybe my heart is ruling my head. Maybe it’s because I’ve got family and friends in the city and I used to play for the club. But I am going to say here and now they are my tip to retain the title and it will take a brilliant team to stop them. </p>

<p>People said the wheels came off a bit after lockdown once they had won the title. Come on! Human nature led them to relaxing a little after they had become champions. They were entitled to have a drink and enjoy what they had achieved.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to maintain intensity after you have reached your goal. To my eye, they are the best team in the land. Whoever finishes above them, wins it.</p>

<p>As it is, we can only dream of what might have been and City will aim to reclaim their crown by proving they have put the inconsistencies of last season behind them.</p>

<p>I think Nathan Ake is a good signing and a fit Aymeric Laporte will make a huge difference. They are as good as Liverpool as an attacking force — they need to match them defensively to overhaul them.</p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: I like what they are doing. They reached the Champions League with a power-packed finish to last season and the arrival of Bruno Fernandes was the catalyst for a sustained run of good form.</p>

<p>They are only going to get stronger. It is going to be interesting to see how it all fits together, as I look at a midfield of Donny van de Beek, Fernandes and Paul Pogba and wonder who will take what role. How do they all start together if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer plays a front three?</p>

<p>CROUCHIE'S VERDICT: One of the most pleasing themes of late summer has been seeing Steve Bruce get the players in he has wanted.</p>

<p>The additions of Jeff Hendrick, Ryan Fraser, Callum Wilson and Jamal Lewis will make Newcastle significantly stronger and I don’t for one moment see them facing trouble this season. </p>

<p>Steve had a tough time last year, following the popular Rafa Benitez, but he got on with his work and kept Newcastle up. For all the talk of takeovers and investment, I am delighted to see he has got another opportunity and I believe he wanted to sign Eberechi Eze too to give the fans excitement. It’s time for the negativity that has gripped the club to disappear.</p>

<p>Europe for a club like Sheffield United can be debilitating and unsettling. I saw it first hand at Stoke and was told about the effect it had on Burnley. I would have hated to see all the good work they did come undone by that Thursday-Sunday schedule.</p>

<p>It helped, of course, having a striker like Danny Ings. I know people at Liverpool who would have loved to have kept him as a back-up but he had to leave to play.</p>

<p>The signing of Grady Diangana is very exciting. He played a key role in them bouncing back out of the Championship in Bilic’s first season and the investment West Brom have made shows how highly they rate him.</p>

If you look at what has happened in their build-up to the new season, with unhappy players and bad results, you’d have them down for being relegated.</p>

<p>They have got a good, solid manager in David Moyes and he will get them organised. He didn’t get enough credit for keeping them up last season and has made some good signings but he really needs a defender to keep it all together.</p>
