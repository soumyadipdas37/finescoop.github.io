        <p>A last gasp challenge which could have stopped the British ISIS Beatles facing justice in America has been thrown out of the High Court this morning.</p>

<p>Maha Elgizouli, whose son El Shafee Elsheikh is in US custody with his co-accused Alexanda Kotey, brought a judicial review earlier this month over Priti Patel's decision on August 24 to provide material to the American government under a "mutual legal assistance (MLA)" request.</p>

<p>It saw the court initially making an order stopping the Secretary of State from providing any further material to the United States Government until the handing down of this judgment or further order. </p>

<p>But today the Queen's Bench threw out the claim, branding it 'not properly arguable' and shutting down the route to frustrate the prosecution.</p>

<p>The judgement released today said: 'We have concluded that this application is not properly arguable, and we refuse permission to apply for judicial review.</p>

<p>'On the handing down of this judgment, the Order referred to, prohibiting the Secretary of State from providing any further material to the United States Government, has now ceased to have effect.'</p>

<p>Elsheikh and Kotey are accused of belonging to a cell of executioners in Syria - nicknamed The Beatles because of their British accents - responsible for killing a number of Western captives.</p>

<p>The new court move means they face a life sentence at the notorious 'supermax', formally known as the US Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado. </p>

<p>El-Shafee El-Sheikh (left), 32, and Alexanda Kotey (right), 36, were members of the 'Beatles' terror cell which was behind the beheading of two British aid workers and two US journalists</p>

<p>Maha Elgizouli, whose son El Shafee Elsheikh, refused to comment on the legal proceedings</p>

<p>At the hearing in London on September 11, Ms Elgizouli's lawyers argued Ms Patel's decision was unlawful as it is incompatible with the Data Protection Act, and are asking the court to order that no material should be provided to the US.</p>

<p>In written submissions to the court, Richard Hermer QC said the international transfer of the data is "not strictly necessary" in circumstances where the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is due to make a decision "imminently" about whether the pair should be prosecuted in the UK.</p>

<p>He argued Ms Patel did not make sufficient inquiries as to whether a prosecution would be undertaken in the UK, and she "failed to address adequately or at all" what the appropriate jurisdiction for a prosecution would be when reaching her decision.</p>

<p>The barrister added: "It is in any event irrational to decide to transfer data, and provide co-operation permitting the use of that data in US proceedings, in circumstances where there is a realistic prospect that the (DPP) may bring a prosecution... in this jurisdiction."</p>

<p>Mr Hermer said the hearing is urgent as the US Government has indicated it will transfer the pair to Iraq for trial, where if found guilty they will be executed, if it does not receive all the evidence the UK has on them by October 15.</p>

<p>He said the DPP had indicated in late August that he would reach his decision on whether they should face trial in the UK in "three to four weeks".</p>

<p>Lawyers for Maha Elgizouli claimed Home Secretary Priti Patel has not considered UK charges</p>

<p>Other members of the 'Beatles' cell are said to include Mohammed Emwazi, the group's ringleader, also known as Jihadi John, who was killed in a US air strike in 2015, while Aine Davis is in jail in Turkey for terror offences, while Aine Davis is in jail in Turkey for terror offences</p>

<p>June 11, 2018: Savid Javid authorised the sharing of 600 witness statements gathered by the Metropolitan Police under a 'mutual legal assistance' agreement in a letter to then US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. </p>

<p>June 11, 2018: Mr Javid wrote to Mr Johnson, indicating that 'significant attempts' had been made to obtain assurances, but that the time had arrived to accede to the request for information without seeking any assurance. </p>

<p>He acknowledged that there was a serious risk that Elsheikh and Kotey would, if prosecuted and convicted, face execution as a direct result of UK assistance. </p>

<p>June 20, 2018: Mr Johnson replied on: 'On a balanced assessment of the key risks... I agree that as this is a unique and unprecedented case, it is in the UK's national security interests to accede to an MLA request for a criminal prosecution without death penalty assurances for Kotey and Elsheikh'.</p>

<p>July 26, 2018:  Elsheikh's mother Maha Elgizouli gets a High Court injunction to stop any further material from being handed over.</p>

<p>November 2018: Ms Elgizouli urges the Crown Prosecution Service to carry out a review if there really is insufficient evidence for him to be charged and tried in the UK.</p>

<p>By now the material handed over by the UK is returned to it by the US.</p>

<p>January, 2019: The High Court rejects a challenge by Ms Elgizouli over the UK government's decision to share evidence with American authorities.</p>

<p>March, 2020: The mother's appeal sees the decision overturned again and the Supreme Court blasts the UK Government's 'unlawful' decision to bow to US pressure to share evidence on the so-called ISIS Beatles without receiving assurances the suspects would be spared the death penalty.</p>

<p>August 19, 2020: The US says they will no longer seek the death penalty for the pair, sparking hope justice will be served. </p>

<p>August 26, 2020: The Supreme Court rules they can now be sent to the US</p>

<p>September 11, 2020: Ms Elgizouli's lawyers claim Ms Patel's decision was unlawful because she did not consider if they would be prosecuted in the UK</p>

<p>September 22, 2020: High court refuses permission for judicial review and allowing the UK evidence to be sent the US </p>

<p>Ms Elgizouli's case is opposed by the Home Secretary, and lawyers representing her say she acted "rationally and lawfully" when reaching her decision.</p>

<p>Sir James Eadie QC, representing Ms Patel, said the DPP has now concluded the review and determined that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute Elsheikh for a number of "terrorism-related offences".</p>

<p>He told the court that those offences either require consent of the Attorney General, Suella Braverman, or her permission for the DPP to consent to a prosecution.</p>

<p>Mr Hermer said there was a charging decision by the DPP in 2016, made with the consent of the Attorney General, that there was sufficient evidence to charge Kotey - whose whereabouts were then unknown - with five offences of murder and eight of hostage taking.</p>

<p>He told the court the US authorities have "always made clear their preference" for both men to be tried in the UK, and said Ms Patel's decision to share evidence was "premature" while there was still uncertainty about where they should face prosecution.</p>

<p>Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Garnham will give their ruling at 10.30am on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Elsheikh and Kotey were captured in January 2018, sparking an international row over whether they should be returned to the UK for trial or face justice in another jurisdiction.</p>

<p>They were transferred to the custody of the US military in Iraq in October 2019 and remain in American custody.</p>

<p>American officials revealed last month, in a letter to Ms Patel from US Attorney General William Barr, that they will not insist on the death penalty for the pair following any prosecution.</p>

<p>Ms Elgizouli previously brought a challenge to former home secretary Sajid Javid's decision to share evidence with US authorities without seeking assurances the men would not be executed if convicted in the US.</p>

<p>Her case was dismissed by the High Court in January 2019 but that decision was overturned in March this year by a panel of seven Supreme Court justices, who unanimously allowed her appeal - ruling the decision to share evidence with the US was unlawful under the Data Protection Act.</p>

<p>In June 2018, Mr Javid authorised the sharing of 600 witness statements gathered by the Metropolitan Police under a "mutual legal assistance" agreement in a letter to then US attorney general Jeff Sessions.</p>

<p>Mr Javid faced intense criticism after the letter to Mr Sessions was leaked, with MPs accusing him of breaching the UK's long-standing opposition to the death penalty.</p>

<p>Then prime minister Theresa May supported Mr Javid's original decision, which was also backed by current Prime Minister Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary.</p>

<p>Kotey and Elsheikh, who were raised in the UK but have been stripped of their British citizenship, were captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces in January 2018.</p>

<p>They are said to have been members of the cell that also included Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, who was killed in a US air strike in 2015, and Aine Davis, who has been jailed in Turkey.</p>

<p>Emwazi appeared in a number of videos in which hostages, including British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, were killed.</p>

<p>James Foley, from Illinois, USA, was a journalist who first went missing in November 2012</p>

<p>James Foley, from Illinois, in the US, was a journalist who first went missing in November 2012.</p>

<p>On his way to an internet cafe,  while reporting for the GlobalPost, he had been taken hostage at gunpoint by militants from the group Jabhat al Nusra in Taftanaz, northern Syria.</p>

<p>Jabhat al Nusra subsequently joined forces with ISIS - which did not exist in anything like its current form when Mr Foley was taken.</p>

<p>Mr Foley joined other prisoners, who were European and British, in the ISIS prison and despite attempts to rescue him, he was eventually murdered by his captors.</p>

<p>His fellow prisoners spoke kindly of Foley, who called people 'Bro' and never argued over shortages of food, despite meagre rations equating to cup of food-a-day, often sharing his portion and his blanket. </p>

<p>Mr Foley often made efforts to maintain prisoners' morale, persuading them to play games and to give talks on their favourite subjects.</p>

<p>He even organised a 'Secret Santa' during Christmas 2013, encouraging hostages to make gifts out of whatever they could find. </p>

<p>ISIS posted his execution video, titled 'A Message to America' to social media as proof of his death.</p>

<p>In scripted remarks before his killing, kneeling in an orange jump suit, he said: 'I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again. </p>

<p>'But that ship has sailed. I guess all in all I wish I wasn't American.' </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Steven Sotloff, 31, from Miami, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished in Syria in 2013</p>

<p>US journalist Steven Sotloff, 31, vanished in Syria in August 2013.</p>

<p>Mr Sotloff was not seen again until he appeared in a video released online by ISIS on August 2014, that showed James Foley's beheading.</p>

<p>In a second clip, published weeks later, entitled 'A Second Message to America,' Mr Sotloff appeared in a orange jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter.</p>

<p>The grandson of Holocaust survivors, Mr Sotloff grew up Miami, before attending the Kimball Union Academy boarding school in New Hampshire before studying at the University of Central Florida. </p>

<p>While at Kimball, Mr Sotloff was an avid rugby player and on moving to UFC began working for the student newspaper there, the Central Florida Future.</p>

<p>He left this paper in 2005 and began to pursue his dreams of journalism full time.</p>

<p>'The guy lit up a room. He was always such a loyal, caring and good friend to us,' former roommate Josh Polsky told the New York Times. </p>

<p>'If you needed to rely on anybody for anything he would drop everything on a dime for you or for anyone else.'</p>

<p>Sotloff travelled to the Middle East as a freelance journalist and wrote reports from Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Turkey and Syria.</p>

<p>He often had pieces in Time and Foreign Policy magazines.</p>

<p>'A million people could have told him what he was doing was foolish, as it seemed to us outsiders looking in, but to him it was what he loved to do and you weren't going to stop him,' his friend, Emerson Lotzia, said.</p>

<p>'Steve said it was scary over there. It was dangerous. It wasn't safe to be over there. He knew it. He kept going back.' </p>

<p>Alan Henning, a father-of-two, was kidnapped on Boxing Day 2013 as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees</p>

<p>Alan Henning, a father-of-two, was kidnapped on Boxing Day 2013 as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees.</p>

<p>The taxi-driver, from Manchester, was kept hostage until he was beheaded by Jihadi John on video in October 2014.   </p>

<p>Before he was killed, Mr Henning was forced to tell the camera that he was being murdered in retaliation for parliament's decision to attack ISIS.  </p>

<p>Originally from Salford, he had seen the suffering first hand during a life-changing visit to a refugee camp, which inspired him to help the innocents whose lives were being wrecked by the conflict.</p>

<p>After volunteering with a Muslim charity, the 47-year-old agreed to drive 3,000 miles in a convoy of old ambulances to help the aid effort and take much-needed medical supplies to hospitals in the northern Syrian province of Idlib.</p>

<p>Known as 'Gadget' to friends and family for his fondness for technology, Mr Henning had been washing cars in the UK to raise money for donations before setting off on his fourth visit to the country.</p>

<p>He travelled with eight others from charity Al-Fathiha Global, who intended to deliver vital equipment, including NHS ambulances packed with baby milk, nappies, food and defibrillators, but was kidnapped by ISIS extremists on Boxing Day, shortly after making the 4,000-mile journey to the town of Al-Dana.</p>

<p>A fan of Phil Collins, which he enjoyed playing as he drove, Mr Henning was incredibly popular and during one trip insisted on sleeping inside his ambulance instead of a hotel to save money so it could be donated to the refugees instead.</p>

<p>Kasim Jameel, leader of the convoy on which Mr Henning was travelling when he was kidnapped, described his friend as a 'big softie.'</p>

<p>Dr Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, who was also in the convoy, said Mr Henning was 'remarkable.'</p>

<p>'He's such a compassionate and selfless human being,' she said. 'It just simply wasn't enough for Alan to sit back and just donate or raise awareness.</p>

<p>He had to get up and do something about what he'd seen Every time the convoys went he had a yearning to go. That really motivated him, to see, practically, first-hand the difference he was making.' </p>

<p>David Haines, who was beheaded a week after Steven Sotloff, was the first British victim of Jihadi John</p>

<p>David Haines, who was beheaded a week after Steven Sotloff, was the first British victim of Jihadi John. </p>

<p>The father-of-two, from Holderness, East Yorkshire, was taken hostage while working for relief agency ACTED in Syria in March this year.</p>

<p>He was captured near the Atmeh refugee camp, just inside the Syrian border with Turkey. </p>

<p>Mr Haines spent his career as an aid worker helping to protect innocent civilians in developing nations.</p>

<p>For more than two decades, he travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, the former Yugoslavia and South Sudan.</p>

<p>He dedicated his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old was described as a hero by his family, who were inspired by him to travel the world on further aid missions.</p>

<p>He had a teenage daughter in Scotland from a previous marriage with his first wife, and a four-year-old daughter, Athea, in Croatia from his second wife.</p>

<p>Mr Haines was brought up in Perth, Scotland, and studied at Perth Academy before joining the military aged 17.</p>

<p>According to his online CV he spent 11 years in the military, holding 'various positions covering security and threat assessments in a number of different countries' between 1988 and 1999.</p>

<p>It did not specify with which armed forces he served, although his ISIS execution video claimed he had been in the Royal Air Force. </p>

<p>His brother Mike later confirmed this, saying he was an engineer. </p>

<p>Peter Kassig, a 26-year-old from Indiana, was beheaded by ISIS executioner Jihadi John in November 2014</p>

<p>Peter Kassig, a 26-year-old from Indiana, started a non-profit organisation called Special Emergency Response and Assistance (SERA).</p>

<p>The Iraq war veteran, who was living in Beirut to provide relief for refugees of the Syrian crisis, was beheaded by ISIS executioner Jihadi John, in November 2014.</p>

<p>Writing on his profile page on fundraising website FundRazr, Mr Kassig said he had previously worked as a medic in a hospital in Tripoli, Lebanon.</p>

<p>He said: 'When I first started this cause to help those in need, I was on my own but I saw first-hand the shortages in available resources and supplies for people who were suffering in Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey as a result of the violence.</p>

<p>'The amount of feedback and support from people all around the world motivated me to get organised and develop a platform through which people could send donations to support the continuation of my work.'</p>

<p>Kassig joined the U.S. Army Rangers in 2006 and was deployed to Iraq in 2007.</p>

<p>He was honourably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour and returned to the United States to study political science.</p>

<p>However, in 2010, he decided to take time off from his studies and began his certification as an emergency medical technician.</p>

<p>He then decided to travel to Beirut to try and help those in need as a result of the Syria crisis.</p>

<p>It was after a short time in the country that he started up his own aid group, SERA.</p>

<p>Few details are publicly known about how Kassig was taken captive. </p>

<p>The 26-year-old humanitarian who said there was always light in darkness</p>

<p>Kayla Mueller, 26, was kept as a sex slave by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi</p>

<p>American Kayla Mueller was a humanitarian aid worker who was kidnapped and taken hostage in August 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria.</p>

<p>She was kept as a sex slave by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, who raped her repeatedly during her captivity.</p>

<p>The fanatics reportedly demanded 5 million euros from Mueller's family, telling them that that they would send a picture of her body if they were not given money.</p>

<p>Kotey has admitted having contact with her, adding: ‘I took an email from her myself. She was in a room by herself that no one would go in.'</p>

<p>Her death was reported in February 2015 and her name was used as the codeword for the daring US raid that killed her once captor.</p>

<p>Kayla’s body has never been found and her parents live in hope her remains will be recovered.</p>

<p>Mother Martha said: I want people to see the light in Kayla in such utter darkness, how she just said there is always light.</p>

<p>"And I also want people to see that she even told people that as far as where she was, maybe she was supposed to be there, this is where she was supposed to be all along. She always wanted to help.’</p>
