One Direction's waxworks have been removed from Madame Tussauds in London after seven years on display. 

The figures of the much-loved boy band, who split in 2016, were moved off the floor of the tourist attraction this week. 

And despite all the members' solo successes, there are no plans for the singers to be displayed alone, according to The Sun.

It's over: One Direction's waxworks have been removed from Madame Tussauds in London after seven years on display

Harry Styles, 26, Liam Payne, 27, Niall Horan, 26, Louis Tomlinson, 28, and Zayn Malik, 27, formed One Direction in 2010 on the X Factor when Simon Cowell put them together.

Each member auditioned for the show separately but failed to make it to the Judge's Houses stage as solo acts. 

They went on to sell more than 70million records over a very successful career and their waxworks were unveiled in 2013. 

Madame Tussauds said the decision to remove them was made after the band's tenth anniversary this summer.

Updates are constant as it 'reacts to the celebrity landscape', it told the publication.

Cheryl, 37, also had her waxwork removed from the attraction last summer. 

Back in May band member Liam Payne said a One Direction reunion 'seemed very hopeful' for the band's 10th anniversary.

Speaking to People magazine in a video chat the 26-year-old said that he and his former bandmates are 'in the middle of [figuring out] what to do' to mark their anniversary this year. 

'Obviously, we know it's a very big anniversary and we definitely want to do something,' the Strip That Down singer said. 

'I mean, it's a tough one. I can't promise any reunion plans because it just isn't it right now.' 

He added: 'I always put it down to music language because everyone's releasing at the moment with like two years worth of promo. But, you know, it still seems very hopeful in that department. I'm starting to think it's gonna happen at some point. So it's exciting.'

He went on to add that he has had time to reconnect with his former band mates while they all separately isolation amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

'But it's been nice,' he continued. 'It's been so lovely. And it's just nice to see everyone turned out to be nice people, you know?' 

The boys have been focusing on their solo projects over the last four years, since going on hiatus in March 2016.

The news of their extended break was first revealed in August 2015, just a few months after Zayn unexpectedly quit the band, leaving fans around the world heartbroken.     

They won 200 awards including seven Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, seven American Music Awards and 28 Teen Choice Awards.
