She's undergone a dramatic physical transformation since starring on Matt Agnew's season of The Bachelor last year.

And on Tuesday, Emma Roche drew attention to her changing looks in her latest selfie shared to Instagram.

The 33-year-old angled the camera from above, showing off a much plumper pout, defined cheekbones, and an enviable line-free visage.

Like a new woman! Former Bachelor star Emma Roche continued to show off her dramatic transformation, including a much fuller pout and a line-free visage,  in her latest Instagram selfie on Tuesday (pictured) 

Emma's radiant skin was enhanced by a flawless makeup palette, consisting of groomed brows, false lashes and a sweep of blush along her cheekbones.

Her luscious brunette locks were splayed across her couch, presumably at her home in Sydney, and she dressed casually for the occasion in a white cotton number.

Last Tuesday, Emma turned heads in another Instagram selfie, once again drawing attention to her full lips and slimline facial features.

The former reality star wore glamorous makeup in the photo, including mascara, dewy foundation, blush and pale pink lip gloss.  

She wore a black shirt and styled her curly brown locks away from her face, secured with a headscarf.

'Starring the big hair,' Emma captioned the photo.

It's unclear exactly what she has done to enhance her looks, but last year she admitted to getting some 'subtle filler' to create the perfect jawline.

'A pleasure welcoming @thebachelorau's @miss_emma_roche back to the clinic recently!' the Cosmos Clinic wrote on Instagram.

'A subtle treatment of dermal filler to the chin enhanced her profile, created a more defined jawline, and achieved a more balanced overall appearance. Looking forward to seeing you again soon, Emma!'

The brunette beauty often tags the Cosmos Clinic in her Instagram selfies, along with her cosmetic nurse Benoite Boucoiran. 

Emma made it to the top four on last year's season of The Bachelor, before she was eliminated by astrophysicist Matt.

She was known as a 'stage-five clinger' on the show after becoming the first contestant to use the L-word.
