They have been cooking up a storm while in lockdown with their family during the COVID-19 pandemic.

And it looks like Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness were in for a treat on Monday evening.

For Deborra-Lee was seen arriving home from Lobel's of New York, a high-end Manhattan butcher which sells very expensive prime meats.

The 64-year-old actress and producer carried several bags from the store as she arrived home to the couple's multi million dollar apartment.

Deborra-Lee dressed casually for her errands, wearing black leggings and a matching jumper.

She accessorised with a very expensive Hermes handbag and, of course, a face mask.

Hugh and Deborra-Lee had plenty to celebrate this week as Hugh's lauded television drama Bad Education won a Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Television Movie on Saturday.

Hugh was also nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Limited Series Or Movie for his role in the show, but lost out to Mark Ruffalo for his performance in I Know This Much Is True.

Despite his loss, Hugh has received wide praise from fans and critics alike for his role as a corrupt school superintendent in Bad Education, with many calling it the actor's best performance yet.

In an interview with Variety, Hugh described the opportunity to portray real-life school superintendent Frank Tassone as 'fascinating'.

'The role itself was something different from what I've done. I liked the idea of someone who is super successful, very, very good at what he did, beloved by the community - and fell down this slippery path,' he said.

And he described playing the villain as 'delicious' during an interview with Collider.

'As an actor, it just had so much to play with, and so many things that I've never really had the opportunity to play with. He's seemingly very charming, but also just a viper... Those things, I just found really exciting to play,' he said.

Hugh's wife Deborra-lee Furness recently revealed how she and her husband kept occupied while in lockdown with their family during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In an interview on Georgie Gardner's Drive podcast, Deborra-lee said the couple start each morning by reading together for half an hour.

'We read something of substance, so it sets you up for the day and we have a bit of a debate,' she explained.

'We [also] do meditation, we walk the dogs, we work out and then we start our day. It gives you a structure to hold on to.'

Deborra-lee also revealed Hugh has been baking everyday during lockdown, saying: 'He's a big baker. It's his new passion. He bakes literally every day.'

Hugh and Deborra-lee share their daughter Ava, 15, and son Oscar, 20.

Last month, Hugh also revealed being able to reconnect with his family was the one upside of the global health crisis.

'It's re-calibrated what is important,' the Wolverine star told ET Canada.

He continued: 'In many ways that has been a bonus. The silver lining has been quality time that I thought wouldn't happen again.'

The Greatest Showman star said he and his family were keeping occupied by doing puzzles together, playing games, watching movies and baking.

Hugh added that he was also able to finish watching Stranger Things, Succession and Ozark on Netflix with his 15-year-old daughter, Ava.

What a good sport!  Despite his loss, Hugh has received wide praise from fans and critics alike for his role as a corrupt school superintendent in Bad Education, with many calling it the actor's best performance yet
