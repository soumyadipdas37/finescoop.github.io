 She's a member of one of the world's biggest girl bands.

And Perrie Edwards, 27, proved she has all the makings for the job as she showcased her natural beauty in a dazzling headshot posted to Instagram on Saturday.

The Shout Out To My Ex singer stared intensely over her shoulder in the photo, where she added a caption to note she had 'caught the right light'.

Natural beauty: Perrie Edwards dazzled fans with her grey-eyed stare in this headshot posted to Instagram on Saturday

She wore minimal make-up, with jet black mascara around her eyes but only a hint of foundation and lip gloss to best showcase her natural beauty.

The Little Mix singer's chin rested on her bare shoulder with her lips pursed open provocatively, for the ultimate beach babe look. 

She accessorised for the snap with a number of ear-lobe and cartilage piercings, while her flaxen tresses hangs loosely in waves over her shoulders. 

Perrie alluringly captioned the post: 'Tried to find the light, it found me first...'.  

Bubbly: The singer also recently shared a shot of her in the dramatic headdress she wears in the video for Little Mix's latest single, Holiday

Happy couple: Perrie is back at work after enjoying a relaxing summer with beau of three years, footballer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain

Little Mix - which includes Perrie and bandmates Leigh-Anne Pinnock, 28, Jade Thirlwall, 27, and Jesy Nelson, 29 - are set to release their sixth album, Confetti, on 6th November. 

The band released a video for their latest single Holiday last month, in which Perrie accessorises in a stunning bubble-inspired headpiece that she recently shared a snap of with her fans.

The band shared the front cover of their new album on Instagram for the first time on Wednesday. 

The girls looked sensational as they posed up a storm wearing only glitter on their faces in the sizzling new artwork.

Sharing the snap, they wrote: 'So much love, emotion and energy has gone into the making of this record and now the news is out we can finally get excited about it with you!!'

Little Mix's previous albums are DNA, Salute, Get Weird, Glory Days and their most recent offering LM5 in 2018.

The band's recent recent publicity push will be a welcome change for Perrie, after she was forced to spend much of August in quarantine following a trip to Ibiza due with boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. 

The couple made their relationship Instagram official in January 2017 and spent all of lockdown together.
