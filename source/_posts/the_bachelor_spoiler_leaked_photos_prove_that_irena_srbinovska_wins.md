Photos have surfaced that seemingly prove Irena Srbinovska is the winner of The Bachelor.

The 31-year-old nurse has long been the favourite to win Locky Gilbert's heart, and paparazzi images published by The Wash strongly suggest she gets the final rose.

While there is no 'money shot' of Locky and Irena together, photographers staking out her home in Melbourne have noticed that her car hasn't moved in a week.

The secret's out! Photos have surfaced that seemingly prove Irena Srbinovska wins Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor. Pictured together on the show 

Irena had returned to Melbourne in July, after filming the Bachelor finale in Sydney.

Until about a week ago, she had been seen regularly going to and from work as an anaesthetic and recovery nurse at a nearby hospital.

She rarely left her house for any other reason, besides the occasional trip to the supermarket, because the city is under stage-four lockdown.

But for the past seven days or so, her car hasn't moved from her driveway and she hasn't been spotted out and about in Melbourne.

Her sudden 'disappearance' has led some media insiders to suspect she was secretly whisked off to Sydney a week ago ahead of the season finale airdate next Friday.

If Locky and Irena are indeed a couple - and Channel 10 has insisted they are - then they will be contractually obliged to do press together the morning after the finale.

Where's she gone? While there is no 'money shot' of Locky and Irena together, photographers staking out her home in Melbourne have noticed that her car hasn't moved in a week

Theory: Her sudden 'disappearance' has led some media insiders to suspect she was secretly whisked off to Sydney a week ago ahead of the season finale airdate next Friday

In order for Irena to be available for media interviews in Sydney by next Friday, she would have to have left Melbourne last week.

This is because anyone travelling from Melbourne to Sydney must go through mandatory hotel quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.

So, if Irena did manage to escape the Victorian capital without alerting the paparazzi, then right now she'll be halfway through her hotel quarantine.

As of Friday, Irena is the bookies' favourite to win The Bachelor, with Sportsbet offering odds of just $1.30.

Bella Varelis is tipped for second place ($3.25) and Bec Cvilikas is expected to place third ($7.50). Izzy Sharman-Firth is the outsider at $15.
