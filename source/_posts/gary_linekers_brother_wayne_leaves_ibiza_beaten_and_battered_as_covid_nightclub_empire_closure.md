Gary Lineker's brother Wayne has left Ibiza 'beaten and battered' after the coronavirus pandemic has devastated his business on the party island.

The 58-year-old, who also owns bars and clubs in mainland Spain, Tenerife and Greece, has said they have all been closed for the remainder of the year. 

In his post, which has received more than 19,000 likes, Wayne wrote: 'Adios Ibiza. Until next year.

'For the first time in 9 years of obeachibiza history I won't be at the closing party..I have left Ibiza today beaten and battered.. literally couldn't take anymore.

The 58-year-old shared this snap from the plane on his way back to the UK in emotional post



'If I stayed I would just be an emotional wreck at closing ... @xavierthelifecoach we need to talk...

'So Ibiza lovers Lets look forward now to #ibiza2021 the comeback will be spectacular #wetriedourbes.'

The post was accompanied with a picture looking out of a plane window as he left Ibiza this week.

Just days ago, the bar and club owner heavily criticised the new measures announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a separate Instagram post.

He said: 'I have a bar called @EssexHouse152 run by my son and biz partner @Sean.Lineker.

'We now have to close at 10pm for 6 months ..Sean has tirelessly worked through all these previous ridiculous regulations to keep the business going with his staff and now this ��‍♂️

'you are single handed destroying every single bar owner and restaurant business in the UK. 80% of bar takings are between the hours of 10pm till 1am.

'What is wrong with you? Why are we more likely to catch the virus between 10pm and 1am than down the pub on a packed Sunday afternoon at 3pm watching the footy ..

'You took away by introducing quarantine all the tourist businesses in Spain to give to the bar and pub owners in the Uk tourist resorts and now you just wipe them out like it’s just a game .. you make no sense ��'

Wayne, pictured, added: 'You must like older men but only me...You have to be a worldly and above 30 (OK, 28 or 29 could work) but not my age as that would just look weird'

Father-of-four Wayne has been married once and has had several girlfriends, but is thought to have been single since his 2018 split from ex-fiancée Danielle Sandhu (pictured together) 

It comes after Wayne came under fire after revealing a bizarre list of criteria for his future girlfriend - which includes 'giving up her career, having no children, being able to cook and loving R&B'.

The list was posted to the club owner's Instagram account with the hashtag 'banter' but sparked outrage on social media from followers disgusted with Wayne's demands - such as 'loving the gym and having body definition' and not being the same age as him because 'that would just look weird'.

'Truly unprecedented levels of creep exuding from Wayne Lineker these days,' one unimpressed Twitter user wrote.

Father-of-four Wayne has been married once and has had several girlfriends, but is thought to have been single since his 2018 split from ex-fiancée Danielle Sandhu in 2018, who was 31 years his junior.

Last month, Wayne hit back at haters who criticised a video shared of him picking which 'dream doll' to take on a date at his club in Ibiza - and knocking the rejected women in the pool by their chests.

The list (above) was posted to the club owner's Instagram account with the hashtag 'banter' but sparked criticism on social media from followers disgusted with Wayne's demands 

Following the criticism of his criteria, Wayne added to his message: 'This post is purely tongue in cheek banter.'

Taking to Instagram yesterday, Wayne wrote: 'So, my family have decided I need a girlfriend for my own sanity and health...so here’s my criteria.

'OK, let’s start this off like I’m normal: strong, nice, and loving personality. Now to more important things:

'You must like older men but only me...You have to be a worldly and above 30 (OK, 28 or 29 could work) but not my age as that would just look weird.

'You must like to travel and to fly business class and stay in incredible hotels. Be prepared to give up your career or job or at least be able to work from a laptop on a tropical beach somewhere.

'You will need to spend the summer in Ibiza and the winter in Dubai with two weeks in the UK for Christmas and New Year with the families and holidays to the Maldives.'

The club owner then explained that any potential love interest should come without children because his 'are all grown up'. However, he added that 'a dog is acceptable' if they have a passport.

He continued: 'You must be able to cook as I love cooking, especially Waitrose ready made meals. You also don’t need to be verified I can sort that for you.

'House music and R&B lovers only. No heavy rock or pop music. You must like Netflix especially Money Heist and also real crime. No chick flicks, watch them with your mates.

'You need to be confident enough to be able to go to the front of the queue in nightclubs and accept a table and free drinks from the owners.'

Wayne insisted that any girlfriends should have a driving license to share his Bentley and a future 'Lamborghini Jeep' purchase. 

He also refused to consider any women who have shared teeth whitening posts, appear on OnlyFans, or dating websites, and who are 'boring' or bad at geography.

'You must love the gym, healthy food and have body definition as I will have soon,' he added. 'Accept and love my children and grandchildren and realise no more kids for me.. (never say never though).

'You must be able to let my PA book all yours and our flights and purchase items online for you. You must be able to accept my friends as I will accept yours, and accept I have to reply to girls direct messages and not just guys.'

Despite finishing the post with '#banter', some social media users were left unimpressed with Wayne's criteria.
