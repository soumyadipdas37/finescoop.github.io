A homeless man is offering every cent he has as a reward for the return of his pet dog after she was stolen by heartless thieves. 

Nathan rescued Shaggy from a skip bin and nursed her back to good health after finding her close to death in Surry Hills, Sydney, in 2019. 

On August 30, the little dog was stolen from Circular Quay. 

Nathan had used a toilet for two minutes and when he returned Shaggy was gone.

He ran around pleading for help but claimed he was ignored by everyone, including a police officer.

'All I could do was sit on my bed and cry,' he told Arthur & Co. Pet Concierge.

Now he is offering a $300 reward for the return of his best friend, who he credits with saving his life.  

Nathan said he made a promise to Shaggy to look after her until the day she died and would routinely go without so he could provide for her. 

After finding Shaggy in the bin he took her to a vet and was told she had been badly abused, but he was determined to save the canine. 

Nathan would set aside his own needs for Shaggy and hand feed her quality food while she slowly recovered. 

'I'm very picky about what she eats. I saved her but really she saved me,' he said.

Ever since then the two have been inseparable, Nathan carrying her everywhere he went.

Facebook posts set up to help him find Shaggy have been inundated with messages of support. 

'I pray these two are together again so soon,' one user wrote. 

'I hope she is given back to him ASAP, they need each other,' another added.

'Two souls united through hardship beyond normal...hoping they can be reunited and help each other,' a third user replied. 

Nathan is still sitting on his bed hoping somehow his beloved friend will return to him. 

Anyone with information on Shaggy's whereabouts are encouraged to contact Arthur & Co. Pet Concierge.
