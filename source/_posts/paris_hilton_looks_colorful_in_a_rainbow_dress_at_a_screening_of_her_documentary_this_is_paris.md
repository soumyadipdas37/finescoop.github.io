She's set to reveal the darker moments of her adolescence that shaped her adult life in her new YouTube documentary This Is Paris.

But Paris Hilton looked anything but somber in a rainbow tie-dyed shirt and skirt combo as she led a family and friends screening of the film on Monday in Los Angeles.

Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, neither the 39-year-old celebrity nor her guests appeared to be wearing masks or practicing social distancing.

The heiress' modest outfit reached from the floor up to her neck and also featured long sleeves, though her top revealed a hint of her toned tummy.

The skirt's tight pleats accentuated the swirls of color, which she contrasted with simple black shoes. 

Paris also had a set of large cat-eye sunglasses decorated with stars, which were framed by her long blonde tresses.

Joining her was her adorable gray and black dog, whom she proudly raised in the air to showcase.

Chantel Jeffries caused a stir at the outdoors screening by wearing a black leather jacket with not much else under it.

She had on a black bandeau bra tied at her bust that showed off her taut midriff, and she covered up with faded black jeans and tall black patent leather boots.

The DJ wore her brunette locks in a high ponytail and with dangling strands framing her impeccably made-up face.

Chantel got close to Paris and even shared a hug, contrasting her monochrome ensemble with the host's colorful display.

Nicole Wiliams-English matched Chantel with her own black leather blazer, though she spiced it up by showing off her long legs, and she added a splash of scarlet to her lips.

YouTube sensation Tana Mongeau was among the guests, and she rocked a white tube top under a white jacket that fell off one of her shoulders.

She mixed the top with baggy acid wash jeans and white boots. 

Paris' father Richard Hilton cut a more casual figure at the gathering in a white polo shirt and a gray zip-up hoodie with navy blue trousers.

The outdoor space featured a bar for guests emblazoned with 'That's Hot,' one of Paris most popular phrases from her days on The Simple Life with Nicole Richie.

Although the guests didn't socially distance while chatting, the grassy area had white couches and mats laid out for socially distanced pods of people. 

The new documentary features shocking revelations about Paris' adolescence, including a stint in an allegedly abusive boarding school in which she was fed tranquilizers, verbally abused and endured 10-hour stretches in solitary confinement.

The film also generated buzz because Paris drops much of her recognizable vocal fry, unveiling a smoother, deeper voice that she claims is how she really talks.
