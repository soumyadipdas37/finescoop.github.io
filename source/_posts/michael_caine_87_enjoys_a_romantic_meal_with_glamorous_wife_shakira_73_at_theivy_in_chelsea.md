They celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary in January after tying the knot in 1973. 

Michael Caine enjoyed a romantic meal out with his glamorous wife Shakira at The Ivy Chelsea Garden in London on Thursday night.

The Italian Job star, 87, cut a smart figure as he walked hand-in-hand with his former model spouse, 73, outside the upmarket eatery.

Michael opted for a light blue unbuttoned shirt with dark trousers and a matching zip-up jacket for the meal.

While Shakira looked radiant as she opted for an oversized blue cotton shirt with black trousers and a navy patterned jacket. 

Adding some finishing touches, the former actress opted for a sparkly clutch bag, heels and gold pendant earrings.

Shakira styled her brunette locks back into a chic hairdo and added a slick of make-up which enhanced her age-defying features.

The couple appeared in good spirits with Michael using a walking stick as they made their way home after enjoying a romantic meal out where they were stopped by a fan.

Former British Army solider Caine has been walking with the aid of a stick since a nasty fall on a patch of ice in 2018, leaving him with an ankle injury.

'Michael slipped and broke his ankle in his garden during the recent heavy snow,' his spokesperson told The Mirror at the time. 'He is in fine health and great spirits.'

Last year, the veteran British actor revealed how he met the love of his life after seeing her star in a coffee commercial.

'I was at home and this commercial came on, for Maxwell House coffee. And there was this beautiful Brazilian girl,' he told Andrew Denton's Interview.

'I said to my mate, "We're going to Brazil tomorrow - I have plenty of money, we're going to find her".'

Much to the actor's surprise, though, was the fact his dream woman was not on the other side of the world but instead a stone's throw away from where he was living.

'I got all excited and said let's go down to the tavern to have a drink and this other guy comes in. He said, "We made that commercial - she's not in Brazil, she's on the Fulham Road" which is about a mile away from me.'

Michael called his future bride 11 times before she agreed to go out with him.

Michael married Shakira in 1973 and they have one daughter together, Natasha, 47. He has another daughter Nikki, 63, from his previous marriage with actress Patricia Haines.
