The owners of a tiny pup whose impressive bob has earned him comparisons to Anna Wintour has told how he leads a pampered life - including Italian cuisine, ice-cream and regular trips to the groomer. 

Giulia Luciano, 37, and Richard Hanrahan, 36, say stylish pooch Eric, a two-year-old white pekingese from London, is often stopped in the street by strangers who are fascinated by his impressive locks.

His hairstyle, which is perfectly cut into a pristine bob, is groomed every four weeks to ensure it doesn’t lose its shape.

And it's earned Eric a few flattering comparisons to celebrities, including Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.

'Eric loves his hairstyle and the attention his bob generates when he’s out on his daily walks,' explained Giulia. 'People are often telling us how much his bob suits him and we couldn’t agree more.

'I had always wanted a white pekingese and Eric has such a funny personality.

'He doesn’t act like a dog and will often turn his nose up at other pooches who chase after balls or sniff one another.

'Eric communicates a lot with his eyes and is always the leader if he’s out with other dogs.'

Eric’s famous bob has meant he’s often compared to well known faces such as Anna Wintour, Doc Brown from Back to the Future and even Andy Warhol.

Giulia, who is a surgeon, is originally from Italy and says that Eric enjoys nothing more than delicacies such as cured meats and cheese as well as gelato.

She added: 'Now that Eric has had a taste for the finer foods in life he rarely wants his own dog food.

'He doesn’t think of himself as a dog and has very human traits such as his funny facial expressions.

The pekingese loves to cuddle and is taken to the groomer every four weeks to ensure his bob stays pristine

Giulia was so exciting about adopting Eric that she has since set up a Instagram page @eric-thepeke. 

'He has over on thousand followers and he receives dozens of messages about his fabulous hair every day,' she said.

'He normally gets groomed every four weeks but during lockdown I was doing it myself, luckily as I’m a surgeon I’m good with scissors.'

During lockdown, Guilia had to cut Eric's bob herself instead of taking him to a professional groomer
