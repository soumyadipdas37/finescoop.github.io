Jesinta Franklin and her husband, Lance 'Buddy' Franklin welcomed their daughter, Tullulah, six months ago.

Struggles: In an interview with Body + Soul this week, Jesinta Franklin (pictured) explained the difficulties she had breastfeeding

'I was so exhausted, my body was wrecked and, mentally, there were so many tears,' she said. 

'I was encouraged to still pump because I was told that one teaspoon of breast milk a day was better than nothing. I'd torture myself to get even half a teaspoon.'

She went on to add that 'pressure' she felt to breastfeed really affected her mentally. 

Baby joy! Jesinta welcomed her first child, daughter Tullulah, six months ago but revealed that the 'pressure' she felt to breastfeed 'messed with her head' 

 Pain: 'I was so exhausted, my body was wrecked and, mentally, there were so many tears,' she said. 'I was encouraged to still pump because I was told that one teaspoon of breast milk a day was better than nothing. I'd torture myself to get even half a teaspoon' 

'It messed with my head so much – the bottle and breast and cleaning and expressing and sanitising – all because I felt so much pressure,' she added.      

The former Miss Universe Australia's confession comes after she revealed that she had returned to work last month. 

Posting to her Instagram stories Jesinta shared a photo of herself looking glam on the set of a photo shoot.
