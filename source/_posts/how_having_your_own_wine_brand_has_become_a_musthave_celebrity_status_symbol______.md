Branded wine ranges seem to be the latest celebrity tactic for making a few extra pennies as Kylie Minogue joins the list of famous faces with their own vintages, standing to make &pound;1million off the back of their deals.&nbsp;
While most savvy celebrities always have an eye on expanding their ever-growing empires with endorsements and brand deals, wine seems to be the most popular new venture for 2020.&nbsp;
In the last three months alone, Kylie, 52, has launched her new&nbsp;ros&eacute; collection, and actress Cameron Diaz and singer Post Malone have also unveiled their own bottles of pink.&nbsp;
They join a long list of famous faces flexing their star power with their own alcoholic offerings, including Graham Norton, Cliff Richard, Phillip Schofield,&nbsp;Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Sarah Jessica Parker.&nbsp;
And wine brands are not just limited to celebrities, even the Queen has a range of sparkling white wine -&nbsp;Windsor Great Park Vineyard 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kylie Minogue, 52, joins the long list of celebrities using the power of their name to a brand as a side hustle, this time branching out into the wine industry
Last month Cameron Diaz, 47, launched her new wine line in partnership with entrepreneur Katherine Power. The range comprises of a Spanish red and French&nbsp;ros&eacute;
Graham Norton has a successful wine brand, with a best-selling SauviGNon Blanc, South Australian Shiraz, New Zealand Ros&eacute;, Italian Prosecco as well as Pink and Irish gins 
Not a stranger to putting her name to products, Kylie Minogue recently stepped into the world of vintage wines after the success of her affordable collection launch earlier this year.&nbsp;
Her latest addition, &#039;C&ocirc;tes de Provence Ros&eacute;&#039; priced at &pound;18 a bottle, joins her debut Classic Collection which was developed in celebration of her 52nd birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The popstar, who always seems to be at the forefront of the branding deals, also&nbsp;has&nbsp; homeware range Kylie Minogue at Home which launched in 2010, a few years before several stars, including Rita Ora, Holly Willoughy and Tess Daly, jumped on the trend.
And it doesn&#039;t end there, Kylie also has also put her name to several fragrances since her debut into the perfume industry in 2006.&nbsp;
So what is it about wine that may have caught Kylie&#039;s eye as her next side hustle?
After launching her debut vino earlier this year, Kylie unveiled her new vintage offering this week, a deal which one PR expert believes could make her up to &pound;1million
The popstar has been known to use her well-known name to get her foot into the door of several industries, including homeware with her Kylie at Home collection&nbsp;
CEO of PR agency 10 Yetis Digital&nbsp;Andy Barr said &#039;The main draw of the wine business, aside from the obvious cash money returns and the vague tax laws around investing in the industry, is the chance for a niche or maybe B list celebrity to upscale their &quot;brand&quot; appeal and take them to the A-List level, with the right marketing and PR strategy that is.&nbsp;
Andy Barr, CEO of PR agency 10 Yetis Digital, says Kylie could make as much as &pound;1million from the deal
&#039;There is a reason The Beckhams, The Jolie/Pitt&#039;s (RIP to Brangelina!), Sting and Francis Ford Coppola all decided to develop a wine side hustle.&nbsp;
&#039;Lending a respected and well-known name to an existing vineyard enables mediocre or substandard wine to be sold for an inflated price, increasing the potential margin just by franchising a celebrity name.&nbsp;
&#039;Easy money, for very little involvement, especially if they don&#039;t actually own and oversee the production themselves.&nbsp;
&#039;I can&#039;t imagine Posh Spice treading the grapes herself in her skinny white jeans, can you?&#039;
Off the back of their alcohol deals, retail expert Mr Barr said famous faces depending on how well known they are, can stand to make as much as &pound;1million by adding their name to the brand.&nbsp;
Cliff Richard has a wine brand, Vila Nova, which he produces at his vineyard in&nbsp;Adega Do Cantor, Guia, Algarve, Portugal
Rock star Bon Jovi launched a premium&nbsp;ros&eacute; label in 2018 with his son Jesse Bongiovi and&nbsp;acclaimed French Winemaker G&eacute;rard Bertrand. The wine has been named on of the top five ros&eacute;s in the world
Earlier this year Post Malone was one of the latest celebrities to add his name to a&nbsp;ros&eacute; wine brand, Maison No.9
&#039;The potential returns from being associated with a drinks brand depends largely on if the celebrity owns it, or just endorses or licences their name to it&#039; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#039;For example, George Clooney made his bank balance look as handsome as his face when he sold the tequila brand he owned for $1bn.
&#039;A celebrity looking to just lend their name to a brand can expect to earn upwards of &pound;1m based on their own celebrity worth and stature.&nbsp;
&#039;Sometimes the deals are based on sales volumes and, when you think that wine makers are reported to operate at a 50% gross profit margin, you would expect this kind of deal to surpass the &pound;1m endorsement mark.&#039;&nbsp;&nbsp;
