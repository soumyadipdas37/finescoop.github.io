Married At First Sight's Martha Kalifatidis shared a very racy video of her boyfriend Michael Brunelli on Monday. 

Sharing the clip to Instagram, Martha first filmed Michael in a towel, before rolling the camera in the dark for some time before he noticed. 

Completely naked with his back to the camera and his bottom on display, Michael appeared to be trying on some pants.

He noticed Martha was filming - and told her to stop using rather strong language, though he did appear amused. 

Martha praised Michael's bottom, saying, 'Cute a** though doll, f**k it's perky!' 

In the caption for the clip she explained it was revenge for Michael filming her in a similar way.

'Payback is the sweetest joy. I love you so much Bruiser but I’m better at this game than yewww! @mbrunelli'.

Michael took it all in good humour, joking in the comments of the video: 'Booty Builder program link in my bio... just saying'.   

The pair met and fell in love on Married At First Sight two years ago and celebrated their second anniversary on Thursday.

The couple have been one of the strongest to come out of the Married At First Sight Australia experiment. 

During an appearance on KIIS FM this month, Martha revealed the pair had a secret split earlier in their relationship. 

Martha was asked by host Kyle Sandilands if she and Michael had ever broken up before, to which she admitted: 'For like a few hours.'
