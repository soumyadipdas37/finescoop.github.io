The broadcaster also sported a black leather jacket for the day and added to her outfit with a brown handbag.

Also sporting a matching pair of boots, Kate let her blonde locks hang loose down her shoulders for the day.

The mother-of-two put safety first on her way to work as she wore a face mask.  

It comes after fellow Good Morning Britain star Susanna praised Kate for how she has handled her husband Derek's ongoing battle with coronavirus.

Friend: Kate was recently hailed as an 'inspiration' by her GMB colleague Susanna Reid for how she has handled her husband Derek Draper's COVID-19 battle

Kate's husband remains in hospital where he has spent the last six months fighting for his life, including three months in a coma.  

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph's Stella magazine, Susanna said: 'It has been a nightmare that has knocked all of us for six, but Kate is living through it every day. 

'To watch her put on a brave face and carry on has been an utter inspiration for all of us who work on the show, and I also know she's an inspiration to everyone who watches it.

'I don't want to speak on her behalf, but we are a very tight team and this has been the foremost of our thoughts.'

Earlier this month, Kate confirmed she would be returning to work on Smooth Radio so Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.'

The presenter had taken time off work to spend time with her children and Derek who remains in intensive care.

As she announced her return to the airwaves, Kate acknowledged the frightening circumstances she currently faces, but hopes work will provide a welcome distraction for both herself and her husband. 

She said to The Sun: 'I’m delighted to be returning to my morning show on Smooth and to my Global family who have been a big support to me.

'Things are still hugely challenging and a long way from being normal, but I’d like to think that this will give Derek yet another opportunity to hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.

'My heartfelt thanks go to Myleene Klass who has been brilliantly caretaking the show for me and to all my regular listeners for their messages of support.'

She admitted there couldn't be a more relaxing job to ease her back into a stable work routine.

In the midst of Derek's health battle, Kate has focused on looking after their children, Billy, 11, and Darcy, 14.

Voice: Earlier this month, Kate confirmed she would be returning to work on Smooth Radio so Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love'

She announced her departure from Good Morning Britain in August so she could help her children prepare for their return to school, after returning for a few weeks earlier in the summer.

She told viewers: 'I’m actually not here next week. I’m taking a bit of time off, to help Billy get ready for secondary school, and my other children.

'And also Derek, look after that. I just want to say thank you to all of you for absolutely being brilliant since I’ve come back through troubling times.'

Relationship: The presenter had taken time off work to spend time with her children and Derek who remains in intensive care 

She revealed her partner has lost a whopping eight stone over the past six months and was placed in a medically-induced coma to aid his recovery.

He is now out of his coma but still remains in intensive care.

In a moving interview in Saturday's You magazine, Kate said: 'We hope and believe he will come out of it but we just don't know.

'The heart of the family has been ripped out and we don't know if we will ever get it back.'
