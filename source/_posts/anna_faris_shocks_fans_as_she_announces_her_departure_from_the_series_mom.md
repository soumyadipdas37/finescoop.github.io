Anna Faris has shocked fans by announcing her departure from Mom after seven years starring on the hit CBS series. 

'The past seven years on 'Mom' have been some of the most fulfilling and rewarding of my career,' she said in a statement obtained by Variety. 

'I'm so thankful to Chuck, the writers, and my amazing castmates for creating a truly wonderful work experience. While my journey as Christy has come to an end, allowing me to pursue new opportunities, I'll be watching next season and rooting for my TV family.'

According to sources, Anna choose to leave Mom in order to pursue other opportunities.

'From the inception of Mom, Anna was the first and only choice for the role of Christy,' Warner Brothers Television, Chuck Lorre Productions, and CBS said in a statement.

'We are so proud of the stories we have been able to tell during Anna's seven years with us. We wish Anna all the best, and we thank her for her beautiful portrayal.'

Anna's announcement comes just days before the show set to begin season eight production.

Production will begin on September 14, after being delayed due to the pandemic-induced filming shutdown.

Anna starred opposite Allison Janney in the hit CBS series Mom, which followed the escapades of a newly-single sober mother Christy (Faris) and her mother Bonnie (Janney).

The critically-acclaimed show was a ratings hit on CBS, and Allison has received numerous awards for her work on the show, including an Emmy and Golden Globe.

Season three of the series holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where critics conceded: 'Mom continues to nurture the multi-cam sitcom genre with mature storytelling and wonderful performances by Anna Faris and Allison Janney, who both handle reflective drama with the same deft touch as they do comedic timing.'
