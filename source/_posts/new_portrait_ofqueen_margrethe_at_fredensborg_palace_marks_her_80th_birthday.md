The Denmark royal family have released a beautiful new portrait of Queen Margrethe to mark her 80th birthday. 

Margrethe beams in a teal gown and royal jewels, including a tiara, in the stunning photo taken at Fredensborg Palace. 

The portrait was shared by the Royal House on social media, racking up over 29,000 likes from those who dubbed it 'beautiful'. 

Queen Margrethe (pictured) of Denmark posed for a new portrait taken at Fredensborg Palace to mark her 80th birthday 

Queen Margrethe's latest portrait replaces the most recent official photograph that was released of her in 2012.

The snap taken by photographer Per Morten Abrahamsen earlier this summer shows the royal in a teal dress and regalia with the Order of the Elephant in riband with accompanying breast star, Frederik 9.'s portrait with diamonds and Grand Commander's cross of the Order of Dannebrog. 

She completed the look with her Perlepoire set consisting of diadem, necklace, earrings and brooch with precious stones. 

The portrait has been mounted in a newly designed frame of Danish oak with the Royal Crown at the top and is set to be placed in a number of state institutions including embassies and consulates. 

In an official statement the royal house explained the monarchy's portraits are usually changed in connection with special events.

It reads: 'The portraits are therefore also part of the narrative about the Danish head of state’s life and activities.' 









Social media users described the portrait as 'beautiful' as many revealed they're proud to be from Denmark 

Facebook users gushed over the royal's appearance in the recent portrait, describing her choice of dress as 'beautiful'.

Roughly translated, one person wrote: 'We have a very beautiful queen. The queen seems eternal-young/ judged, happy and healthy in her appearance. The new portrait is incredibly good how beautiful the Queen is in that colour too.'

Another said: 'Wow, the Queen is beautiful and what a beautiful colour and dress for her.'

A third added: 'We have a beautiful Queen, a great personality, filled with a fine dignity in every situation.'
