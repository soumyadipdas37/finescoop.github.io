Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has tested positive for coronavirus after reportedly attending a meeting with 20 represetantives from Serie A clubs. 

On Wednesday reports from Italian media claimed an individual from the assembly had been diagnosed with COVID-19, with the news possibly causing a 'domino effect' and requiring all those who attended to have tests and go into self-isolation.

It comes as a huge blow to Napoli and the Italian top flight with the new Serie A season just over a week away.

Napoli's president Aurelio De Laurentiis has tested positive for COVID-19, the club confirmed 

A brief statement on Napoli's official website read: 'SSC Napoli announces that President Aurelio De Laurentiis tested positive for Covid-19 following the swab carried out yesterday.'

Italian outlet La Repubblica previously claimed that one of the directors or chairman at the meeting had tested positive and was not wearing their mask correctly.

Club chiefs were meeting in person for the first time in months, after being forced to speak virtually when lockdown began in Italy, to discuss preparations for the 2020-21 campaign.

De Laurentiis has reportedly suffered with pneumonia recently and his diagnosis could have a big impact on the way the club conducts transfer business.

Napoli have sold midfielder Allan to Everton for £25m this summer and have brought in Victor Osimhen for £74m as their only addition so far.

The Naples outfit face an away trip to Parma in the first Serie A game of the season on September 20.
