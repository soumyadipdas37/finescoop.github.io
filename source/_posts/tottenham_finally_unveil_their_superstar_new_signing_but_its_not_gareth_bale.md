United States forward Alex Morgan has been unveiled at Tottenham.

Whilst the men's team wait for their own superstar Gareth Bale to sign, the women's team have released images of their new big signing.

 Morgan has joined the club for the upcoming 2020-21 season from Orlando Pride.

Morgan has scored 107 goals in 169 appearances for her country and was part of the World Cup wins of 2015 and 2019. 

She netted a header in the semi-finals against England at last year's tournament, memorably making a tea-drinking gesture as she celebrated.

Morgan - who gave birth to her daughter Charlie in May - has become another among a number of high-profile names to have moved to the Women's Super League since the end of the 2019-20 season.

That has included four other United States internationals, with Manchester City having signed Sam Mewis and Rose Lavelle and Manchester United earlier this week recruiting Tobin Heath and Christen Press.

Bale and Sergio Reguilon are both expected to sign from Real Madrid for the Tottenham men's side on Saturday after passing medicals.
