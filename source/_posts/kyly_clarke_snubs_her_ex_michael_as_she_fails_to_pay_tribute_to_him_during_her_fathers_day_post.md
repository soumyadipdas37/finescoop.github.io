Michael and Kyly Clarke are said to have a 'great relationship' when it comes to co-parenting their four-year-old daughter, Kelsey Lee.

But former WAG Kyly failed to mention her estranged husband in her Father's Day Instagram post on Sunday.

The 39-year-old omitted any reference to the retired cricketer, also 39, in the post and instead chose to focus on celebrating her own father, Roland.

Kyly looked sensational as she posed with her father for the snap.

She wrote the caption: 'Happy Father's Day to all the amazing dads out there. I hope you all get to enjoy your special day with your beautiful children. Thanks Papa for being you.'

It comes after Michael told Stellar magazine over the weekend that he had a 'great relationship' with his former wife of seven years.

Following their split in February, the sporting legend revealed that the exes had been able to reach a custody arrangement without involving the courts.

'I can sit here and say my daughter is the most important thing in my world. I've got a wonderful relationship and friendship with Kyly,' he said.

Michael and Kyly have a fifty-fifty custody arrangement, which is indicative of the close bond they share despite their separation.

'At the moment we do three nights on, three nights off – that's our routine. Kyly and I talk daily to work out if that is best for Kelsey Lee,' he said.

However, being a single father has its challenges. 

'We always talk about single mothers; the challenges they face. But the single father faces challenges as well,' Michael said. 

'There are things about Kelsey Lee that I learn every day. If I don't see her for three nights, I feel like my girl has turned six... As a parent, I'm absolutely no different to any other father.' 

End of the road: Kyly and Michael announced their separation on February 12, after seven years of marriage. Their divorce is said to be worth $40million
