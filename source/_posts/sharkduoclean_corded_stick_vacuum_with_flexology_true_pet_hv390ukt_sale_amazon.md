The stylish rose gold vacuum from Shark features a unique two brush roll design. One vacuum head houses both a bristle and soft brush roll, which work together to remove everyday household dust and dirt from carpets and hard floors. 

This means it can clean on hardwood floors, carpets and tiles with ease without stopping to switch heads.

In addition, other notable features include swivel steering for manoeuvrability, LED lights and an extra-long 10-metre cord. And thanks to its flexibility, with a click of a button, it folds so it can be stored anywhere in the home.

One satisfied Amazon shopper said it blew competitors such as Dyson out of the water: 'This has got to be the best vacuum I've ever come across if you're thinking between one of these and a Dyson then its shark all the way.

'I've had many Dysons and not lived up to expectations this is the first shark I've owned and will never buy another brand of vacuum!!!'.

Not only is it perfect for stair cleaning and under furniture, but it's also compact and lightweight and can be stored away easily afterwards

All Shark vacuums have an anti-allergen seal, allowing most of the dust particles you pick up to be captured dust while preventing them from releasing back into the air.

This TruePet model also includes the Shark Motorised Pet Tool, designed to remove even the most embedded hair from floors and furnishings.

If you have pets, this Shark model, which is now 26 per cent off, boasts anti-hair wrap technology which actively removes hair from the brush-roll, so you won't need to worry about any clogging or build-up of fur.
