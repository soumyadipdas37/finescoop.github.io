Ten years ago, ITV changed the landscape of UK television forever, with our very own The Hills-style, semi-scripted reality show following the glitz and glamour of Essex.

And when the bright-eyed stars entered in their late teens and early twenties, little did they know their lives were to change forever, with their love lives and careers laid bare for audiences. 

We take a look at how things have changed for the early stars of The Only Way Is Essex... 

MARK WRIGHT

THEN

CAREER 

When Mark made his way on to screens, he was a club promoter and semi-professional footballer. 

As he would frequently brag about his work in many hotspots 'up London', he was the perfect frontman for the show due to his bravado and Lothario ways. 

LOVE LIFE 

Mark's womanising played out in TOWIE's early series, as he was seen to split his time between his long-term girlfriend Lauren Goodger, Sam Faiers and Lucy Mecklenburgh.  Memorable moments included Mark choosing Sam over his other love interests in heartbreaking scenes.

In an explosive twist, Mark popped the question to Lauren in a pub car park - prompting the iconic reaction from Lauren's sister Nicola: 'Are you having a f**king laugh?' 

After proposing to Lauren, the relationship came to a heartbreaking close when he cheated on her with Lucy shortly before leaving the show for good. 

Speaking about the demise of their romance in 2011, Mark said: 'I am not looking for anyone. 

'If it comes along, I can't help it. But ­ideally I want to be on my own for at least a few months before I even start talking to someone.'

NOW  

CAREER 

On the up: After leaving the show, Mark went on to star on I'm A Celebrity, before scooping a career as a TV presenter and fitness mogul

 After leaving the show, Mark went on to star on I'm A Celebrity in 2011, before scooping a career as a TV presenter and fitness mogul.

He presented Take Me Out: The Gossip alongside Laura Jackson however the show was later axed. 

In 2018, Mark moved permanently out in Los Angeles to present US TV show Extra however he cut his stint short when he moved back to the UK the following year.

At the time, he said: 'I’m no longer living in LA. I was there for nearly two years and had the most amazing time. It just feels like the right time to come back to the UK and live here with my wife and family. I’ll always be grateful to the show Extra for the amazing opportunity they gave me.'

In lockdown, he launched his Train Wright fitness programme with his footballer brother Josh.

LOVE LIFE  

In 2015, Mark married Coronation Street star Michelle Keegan in an idyllic ceremony at St Mary’s Church in Bury St Edmonds, where he arrived in a Hummer limo.

He has previously gushed to Michelle: 'You make me so happy and I'm so proud of you. You complete me.' 

Mark has hit out at Lauren on a number of occasions when she has brought up their defunct romance in the public sphere. In 2015, he took to Twitter to write: 'Endless mentions RE: me and us is embarrassing.

'I really thought after lawyers being involved and polite pleas to stop mentioning me she ... Would stop. Maybe not...

'It's hurtful to think one person needs to mention YOU every week to earn a living. Being married to another women... If your reading this, please PLEASE respect my wife and STOP. 

'Everyone has a past, get over it !! I really didn't... Want to have to do this but enough is enough. I'm sure there is other ways...To make money'.

As TOWIE's 10th anniversary aired on Sunday night, Lauren shared a picture with her ex. 

Changing times: After marrying Michelle, he criticised Lauren for using his name in interviews 

LAUREN GOODGER

THEN

CAREER 

Lauren nabbed her dream job during her time on TOWIE as she was recruited to organise Essex Fashion Week. 

She turned down an oppurtunity to jet to Dubai for the role instead choosing Mark over her work. 

She then opened her ill-fated beauty salon Lauren's Way, which was petrol bombed after it opened.  

Lauren turned author when she released her best-selling autobiography Secrets Of An Essex Girl. She lost a staggering amount of weight when she launched her fitness DVD in 2015. 

LOVE LIFE 

Lauren's anguish over her love of Mark dominated her storylines and she spoke at length about how she worked through the pain of their relationship and his Lothario ways. 

Sweet: Mark proposed to Lauren in a pub car park in 2011

In 2013, Lauren seemed to have found her Prince Charming in boyfriend Jake McLean. 

At the time, she was said to have called time on the year-long relationship after numerous bitter arguments, however they reconciled in 2015 before splitting the following year.

Lauren has a tattoo of Mark's name removed from her bikini line after their split and had to go through the process again when she was inked with Jake's name.  

The stunner found love again with Joey Morrisson, who she 'met' while her was in prison serving a 16 year sentence for a string of drug-related offenses. 

Lauren - who also had Joey's name tattooed on her - said of the jailbird: 'This is the weirdest relationship ever, but it's exciting and I think that's why I like it. A bad boy never cheats, a bad boy is very loyal. They're strong family men, they've just got a bit of a naughty side to them.' 

Lauren's romance with Joey hit headlines in 2016, when she revealed having answered the phone at her friend Charlotte's house she began speaking to the convict and their tumultuous relationship began. 

In August 2018 however - shortly before his release - Lauren confirmed she and Joey had gone their separate ways after she had discovered he had been contacting other women during their relationship.

NOW  

CAREER 

Lauren has added many strings to her bow in recent months as she has become an adult content creator, trainee cosmetic nurse and fake tan mogul.

Lauren has joined X-rated subscription service OnlyFans, on which admirers pay a monthly fee to see explicit images of stars of the service. 

She revealed the news in July, as she took to Instagram to share a snap of herself pouting as she posed for a close-up selfie, the erstwhile reality star wrote: 'I’ve given in! To all my fans who want to see me on only fans the time is now... subscribe #dailycontent.' 

She also sells own range of fake tan and endorses Boombod weight loss supplement. 

LOVE LIFE

Lauren has been largely guarded about her current relationship status yet she is working hard on herself rather than focusing her energy on men, as she has started going to therapy.

She revealed earlier this week: 'I have just had my first therapy session. I’ve always been this girl on Instagram that shows a different side to actually who Lauren is… 

'But there’s so much more to me than what is written, the Instagram pictures... And I think that right now, for me, having these sessions and making it public and sharing it is going to be nothing but a good thing.'

Steamy: After proposing to Lauren, the relationship came to a heartbreaking close when he cheated on her with Lucy shortly before leaving the show for good

LUCY MECKLENBURGH

THEN 

CAREER 

 Lucy was introduced to the show not only as Mark's new love interest but also as a fashion buyer. 

While Lauren engineered and organised Essex Fashion Week, Lucy was set to show her designs at the event.  When Lauren learnt of who Lucy was, she stated: 'Oh, I though she was really young, sweet and orange!'

Lucy went on to open her eponymous boutique as well as modelling for and endorsing various brands  

LOVE LIFE 

 Lucy's love life was extremely well-publicised when she burst onto TV screens in 2010 which saw her lock horns with his long-time love Lauren over the Lothario's affections.

A year later, Mark popped the question to Lauren in a pub car park however their engagement came to a dramatic close when Lucy and Mark enjoyed a dalliance in Marbella, despite Lucy being in the early stages of her romance with Mario Falcone.

In November 2011, history repeated itself again when Lucy cheated on her then-fiancé Mario, who had let her previous dalliance slide due to the infant stages of their love, with Mark yet lied about the latest hook-up for weeks.

Following the bitter dissolution of her relationship with Mario, Lucy later enjoyed a fleeting romance with co-star Dan Osborne, as it was claimed they made a sex tape on their first night together during The Only Way Is Marbs special in 2013.

Later that year, the clan headed to Las Vegas for another spin-off, during which she struck up a romance with Tom Pearce - as it was revealed they had enjoyed a liaison in the back of a limousine during their stint in Sin City.

NOW  

CAREER 

Lucy has moved on from her fashion days to find a multimillion pound business by building her Results With Lucy fitness empire, having found love of exercise while on TOWIE. 

Speaking about the idea behind the business, she said: 'The idea was discussed between myself and Cecilia Harris, my friend, personal trainer and now business partner, during one of our training sessions. We both agreed there was a gap in the fitness market for people like me that were quite intimidated by a gym environment.

'We wanted to help people who found it hard to stay motivated, train regularly and who struggled with time to get to and from the gym, attend a class or a PT Session. We also wanted to make sure there was a lot of variety and more motivation than a 1 hour kick-start at home fitness DVD''.

Happy days: Lucy has certainly found her happily ever after since leaving TOWIE 

LOVE LIFE  

Lucy has certainly found her happily ever after since leaving TOWIE. 

The brunette beauty met Corrie star Ryan Thomas on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls in 2017, sparking romance rumours between the pair before they went public with a trip to Wimbledon later that year. 

Following a well-publicised romance, with split rumours included, Ryan popped the question to Lucy in June 2019 during an idyllic trip to the Amalfi Coast.

After the engagement, Lucy told OK!: 'At the start of our relationship, Ryan told me that he couldn't see himself having any more children. It wasn't something I pushed at the time because I wasn't ready to have kids and I assumed that he would change his mind one day.'

Despite this, soon after Lucy and Ryan announced they were expecting their first child before Lucy gave birth to their son Roman in March.

CAREER Arg's career has remained the same following a number of bumps in the road. 

After struggling with addiction, he is now in recovery and has a residency at former co-star Elliott Wright's Marbella restaurant Olivia's. 

LOVE LIFE The star hit headlines in July when it was revealed he and Gemma had ended their relationship after she revealed a string of abusive messages, purportedly sent to her by the TV personality prior to their split.

It's understood James had made derogatory remarks abut her weight after she suggested that he had bought another woman dinner. The series of texts began with Gemma saying: 'What man pays for another woman!!!', while Arg responded by saying: 'Insensitive.'

Clearly riled, the blonde said: 'And the woman that saved your life has to pay for herself!!!' Her next message was masked, but her now-ex responded: 'You are supposed to be treating me you hippo.'

Moments later, Gemma uploaded another series of messages, where he sent her a plane emoji in reply to a picture of flight details.

'I'll take a mate, I'm not booking it. You said you would be a gentleman!', she penned, before he shockingly said: 'YOU FAT F**K. IVE JUST LOST ANOTHER 2000' (sic). He didn't refer to what he had lost 2000 of.

The self-proclaimed diva has decided to take some time off social media, citing that she was 'devastated' and 'heartbroken' by the exchange.
