Kell Brook says he is on the verge of agreeing a fight to challenge welterweight world champion Terence Crawford.

Both camps remain in negotiations but talks have reached an advanced stage and Britain's former world champion is confident a deal will be made for that fight to happen in November. 

Las Vegas has been earmarked to stage the world title fight and Brook insists he has no qualms with travelling across the pond, having dethroned Shawn Porter in the States to win the IBF world title back in 2014.

Kell Brook is set to challenge for a world title again with Terence Crawford in talks to face him

Speaking to Sky Sports, Brook said: 'Talks are progressing and we feel like we are edging closer. My team have been in regular dialogue with Bob Arum.

'He assures us that both him and Crawford are bang up for it, so hopefully we can get it over the line and give the fight fans something to get excited about and to close 2020 in style.

'Crawford is the champ so rightfully they want the fight stateside, Vegas has been discussed. It suits me though. I have always wanted to fight in Las Vegas - the bright lights of 'Sin City'. I've dethroned a welterweight American world champion in his own back yard before - I look forward to doing it again.

'Date wise Bob Arum is looking at mid-November so tell Sky Sports to get the sparklers ready, because I'll be bringing the fans fireworks!'

Pound-for-pound star Crawford could defend WBO strap against Brook in Vegas in November

Despite fighting just once since late 2018 - a knockout victory over Mark DeLuca in February - Brook believes he can do what rival Amir Khan failed to do and beat pound-for-pound star Crawford. 

'People talk about the age factor, but overlook that Terence will be 33 himself by the time we fight,' Brook added. 

'There isn't much between us. I look at the time that's passed as becoming a more mature fighter now and the knowledge and experience I have, for me, make me bang ready for an even more sensational performance.

'He's an elite level fighter but he's never been in with anyone as strong, powerful quick and with the timing I possess. I think he knows that too.

'Nobody at 147 can take that right hand from me when it lands flush!'

The Brit believes he is toughest test of Crawford's career and is confident he can dethrone him
