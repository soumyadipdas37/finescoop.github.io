After spending so much time at home, Britons are lusting over properties online more than ever before.

From a £9.5million dream-pad kitted out with life-size waxworks of Batman and Superman to a £2.25million property where Oasis recorded their debut album, there is something for everyone at the five most viewed homes on Rightmove this summer. As long as you have a few million in the bank.

Copious green spaces and options for home working are at the forefront of an ever growing number of buyers' minds this year, and all the five properties featured here offer both by the bucket-load.

Top five: These are the top five most viewed homes online via Rightmove this summer

While most people will not have the funds to snap up any of the five properties, it seems lockdown has turned us into property dreamers. 

Here are the five most viewed properties online at Rightmove's website this summer.

This sprawling, 32,000 sq ft behemoth of a mansion near Benfleet railway station in Essex has been described as the 'ultimate party pad' for adults.

The £9.5million home, being sold by Scott & Stapleton estate agents, is kitted out with two indoor swimming pools, while the basement resembles a Las Vegas casino and boasts life-size waxworks of Batman and Superman, which guard the entrance to the private home theatre.

The new buyer of this Essex pile will also be able to enjoy a ten-seater jacuzzi, two saunas, two lifts, an 18-seater cinema, a private dance floor and a floodlit tennis court with its own pavilion.

After all that partying, the new buyer of this superb mansion can reside in one of the property's five bedrooms, which all have their own bathrooms.

Another supremely popular property with online browsers at Rightmove this summer was Tregeare House, a Grade II-listed, Palladian-style mansion set in a private country estate surrounded by beautiful parkland and a sweeping driveway. 

This five-bedroom home, up for sale via Savills esate agents, is set in 215 acres of private land in the unspoilt north Cornish countryside and has a working farm and equestrian facilities.

The secluded property boasts a rich history, too. Its first recorded owners were the Baron family and the house is believed to have been built by Jasper Baron and completed in the 1790s.

Here is what estate agents at Savills, who are selling this Cornish gem, have to say about the property: 'The gardens extend to approximately 2 acres with areas of lawn, well established shrubberies and woodlands with a number of pretty areas to sit or follow the sun. 

'Across the lane from the drive are steps down to the granite quay with low branches dipping over the water, giving it ‘secrecy’ and seclusion with a small terrace area and a floating pontoon with winch, currently used to store two speed boats. 

'The property also owns approximately 3.6 acres of foreshore, with tidal mooring rights.'

The seven-bedroom property, on the market via Strutt & Parker for offers over £2.25million, has not been up for sale on the open market for 48 years. 

Opened in early 1974 as one of the very first residential recording studios in the UK, Sawmills Studio, which forms part of the sprawling home, has developed an enviable reputation as a unique recording environment with a long list of successful clients to its name including Robert Plant, Stone Roses, Oasis, The Verve, Supergrass and Muse.

The waterfront property is perfect for music lovers and those who value their privacy, as it is only accessible by boat or on foot. 

If you are looking for somewhere that combines period character with modern architecture this five-bedroom country home could be the one for you.

The property comes complete with horse stables and heated outdoor dog kennels.

The five bedroom home was originally part of the Beaudesert Estate, owned by the current vendors since 2008 having been carefully restored and enhanced over the years to create the luxury high specification home it is today. 

It was awarded the High Commendation under the Alan Key Award for Excellent in Architectural Technology in 2014. 

Summing up the top five list for this summer, Miles Shipside, Rightmove's property expert, said: 'There’s no getting away from the fact that, as a nation, we’re completely obsessed with property. 

'Our homes have become more important than ever before this year, and it’s fascinating to see which properties have captured the imagination of Rightmove users this summer. 

'From the music studio where everything started for Oasis, to an Essex mansion with life-size superhero figurines guarding a home cinema, these five properties are really special.'
