Schitt's Creek was the big winner at Sunday night's 72nd Emmy Awards - breaking the record for most wins in a single season for a comedy.

And an A-list celeb also revealed himself to be a huge fan of the comedy series, as Elton John made a surprise appearance during the largely virtual ceremony to introduce the show for the Outstanding Comedy Series nomination.

The Emmys enlisted celeb fans to lobby for each of the nominated comedy series, with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Gabrielle Union and Zooey Deschanel also making appearances.

Superfan: Elton John made a surprise appearance during Emmy's on Sunday night to introduce Schitt's Creek for the Outstanding Comedy Series nomination

Elton was the biggest surprise though, delighting fans as he gushed that Schitt's Creek is 'a show with a big Canadian heart.'

'Three things really made this show an all-time favourite of mine,' he continued. 'One, they name-checked me in an episode.'

'Two I met the cast backstage at one of my shows in Italy. Three I found out that Daniel Levy was named after one of my songs.'

The superfan's words did the trick as Schitt's Creek went on to scoop the top prize of Outstanding Comedy Series, after already winning the first seven awards of the night.

The show,which broadcast its sixth and final season this year, became the first comedy series to sweep the four main acting categories in a single year as well as the first series to win all seven major awards in a single year, taking home nine gongs in total.  

The sitcom beat out Curb Your Enthusiasm, Dead To Me, The Good Place, Insecure, The Kominsky Method, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and What We Do in the Shadows for the Best Comedy Series prize.

Creators and father-son duo Eugene, 73, and Dan Levy, 37, accepted the honor together as the son took time to urge viewers to vote.

Dan said: 'Oh, boy. Our show at its core is about the transformational effects of love and acceptance. We need it now more than ever before. If you have not registered to vote, please do so, and then go out and vote. That's the only way we need love and acceptance out there. Dad, do the rest of the fun stuff, sorry for making this political.'

He earlier apologized after winning the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.

'Oh, no. Okay, the Internet is about to turn on me. I'm so sorry,' Dan said upon accepting his award in Canada where he gathered with the show's cast and crew.

Wow: Schitt's Creek was the big winner at Sunday night's 72nd Emmy Awards - breaking the record for most wins in a single season for a comedy

Twelve-time Emmy nominee Sandra Oh, 49, noticed his apology.

'Dan Levy - a true Canadian, just apologized for winning!! Lol!!,' Sandra tweeted for her roughly 1.2 million followers. 

The series follows the trials and tribulations of the formerly wealthy Rose family as they are forced to relocate to Schitt's Creek, a small town they once purchased as a joke. 

Schitt's Creek in addition to the Outstanding Comedy Series award also won four acting awards for its lead and supporting actors and actresses as well as awards for directing and writing. It also won costuming and casting awards at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards last week, giving it a record nine Emmy awards, the most for a comedy in a single year.
