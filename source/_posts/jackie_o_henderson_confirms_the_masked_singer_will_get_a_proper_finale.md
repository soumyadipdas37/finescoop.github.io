A coronavirus outbreak halted production of The Masked Singer earlier this month, less than two hours before the finale was set to begin.

But the Channel 10 show will get a proper send-off, with judge Jackie 'O' Henderson confirming on Monday that an in-studio finale has been scheduled.

The 45-year-old confirmed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show that she was 'glad' the cast and crew would get a chance to 'finish it properly'.

She said that once everybody gets out of quarantine, they will tape the finale and the broadcast schedule won't be interrupted.

'I love the show and I'm glad I got to do it and I'm glad we get to finish it,' she told her co-host Kyle Sandilands.

'And we'll finish it properly. It'll be a proper finale. There'll be no Zoom... Everyone is staying back now.'

Production of The Masked Singer was shut down on August 22 when nine people tested positive for the respiratory virus.

About 250 crew members and on-screen talent have been made to self-isolate - including host Osher Günsberg and judges Dannii Minogue, Dave Hughes and Urzila Carlson.

The COVID-19 bombshell came on the night of the show's grand final being filmed.

The show is being produced in Melbourne, which is at the centre of Australia's coronavirus second wave. 

'Production on The Masked Singer has been immediately suspended as a result of several crew members receiving a positive test result for COVID-19,' Channel 10 said in a statement. 

'The health and safety of the community, and our staff and production partners is our number one priority.

'The entire production team, including the masked singers, the host and panellists are now in self-isolation. They are all being monitored closely and are in constant contact with medical authorities.

'Network 10 is working closely with the Victorian Government and the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services. Network 10 is providing all crew with all the support and assistance possible.' 

Premier Daniel Andrews later defended the Victorian government's decision to grant The Masked Singer an exemption to continue filming during the city's stage-four lockdown.

'[The outbreak] does make the point that this is a widely infectious virus,' Andrews said. 'Even if you've got the very best processes in place you'll see positive cases.'
