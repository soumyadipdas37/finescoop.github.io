The Saturdays star, 31, who shares sons Parker, six, and Carter, five, with the footballer, spoke about the clash in her household over baby choices.

Open and honest: Frankie Bridge has revealed that her husband Wayne has threatened to move out if they have the third child - despite her yearning for a bigger brood 

Frankie and Wayne met in 2011 and welcomed their son Parker in October 2013. In July the following year, they wed at Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire,.

In August 2015, Frankie gave birth to another son, Carter. 

On the subject of expanding, she told The Sun: 'Wayne is having none of it! He was like "If we have another one I will either move out or go and get a job I don't care what it is, I will just get a job..." So I was like: "That's a no then?"'

'I change my mind on a daily basis. I really enjoy the baby stage. 18 months is my favourite stage because of my personality - when they are starting to transform into little humans. Everyone hates it but I love it.

Who will win? The Saturdays star, 31, who shares sons Parker, six, and Carter, five, with the footballer, spoke about the clash in her household over baby choices

'I find this bit harder - they can answer back now, they can refuse to do things, they can walk, they can run off. The baby stage I enjoy, although it is difficult and Wayne finds that bit really difficult. If you could give me a 4 year old he would take that.'

In July, Frankie revealed she and Wayne took to spending all their time together in lockdown well, but admitted 'the novelty wore off' eventually.

The singer told how she had been 'dreaming' of getting to spend more time with the family before quarantine. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said: 'We're used to spending a lot of time together. Wayne is retired. I'm home more than I used to be.

The big reveal: In July, Frankie revealed she and Wayne took to spending all their time together in lockdown well, but admitted 'the novelty wore off' eventually

'When the novelty wore off, we were like, 'this is a lot of time at home.' But now, we've found our groove. You don't have to spend all day everyday together even though you're in the same house. 

'It's actually been really nice. I was so busy before lockdown, I was dreaming for a day off. It's been nice to slow down and spend time together. We've enjoyed it.'  

Frankie admitted the couple didn't indulge in too many date nights during lockdown but they did manage to keep themselves entertained.
