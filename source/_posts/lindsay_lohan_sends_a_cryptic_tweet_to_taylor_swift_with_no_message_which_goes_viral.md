Lindsay Lohan apparently wanted to get singer Taylor Swift's attention over the weekend... though no one is sure why.

The 34-year-old actress took to Twitter on Saturday night, sending a tweet which tagged the 30-year-old singer, but had no further message. 

Regardless of Lohan's intent for the tweet, it went viral nonetheless, with over 8K retweets, 53K likes and over 1,300 responses.

Swift herself hasn't responded, and Lohan has yet to clarify to her 8.4 million followers why she tweeted to Swift.

Still, that didn't stop fans from immediately speculating, with some wondering if this could be tied to Lohan's return to music.

Lohan has released two albums, 2004's Speak and 2005's A Little More Personal (Raw), and she signed a new record deal last July.

She released the album's lead single Back to Me in April, though there has been no indication as to when the full album will be released.

One fan, @rachel9742, added, 'She could be hinting at new music new album. And taylor could be featured on it.. maybe???' along with a GIF of Ariana Grande shrugging.

Swift herself fueled speculation about a movie being made from her new song The Last Great American Dynasty, which was suggested by a fan on Twitter.

The fan, @TSlifestyle13, suggested that Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively and Jesse Tyler Ferguson be cast, with Ferguson responding that he's available.

Swift responded, 'Not trying to be "the loudest woman this town has ever seen." But... I LOVE THIS!' 

Movie: Some fans thought the tweet could have some connection to the rumored movie project, even though there is no indication a movie about the song is actually happening
