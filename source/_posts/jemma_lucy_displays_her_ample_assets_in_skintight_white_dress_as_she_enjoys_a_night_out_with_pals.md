She has frequently put her ample assets on display as a glamour model. 

And Jemma Lucy made the most of her eye-popping cleavage, as she made her way to 202 Kitchen in Manchester with pals on Friday evening. 

The Ex On The Beach star, 32, parked her Lamborghini up and headed to the eatery in a figure-hugging white bodycon dress that showcased her hourglass frame.

She put her iconic tattoos on full display in a white mini dress that ruched around her sensational curves and contrasted against her bronzed complexion. 

The slinky number also featured transparent straps which supported her ample cleavage. 

The Celebrity Big Brother star donned a pair of grey trainers with neon turquoise detailing that perfectly complemented her turquoise handbag that draped around her torso.

Jemma kept her raven tresses swept back in a sleek bun and opted for a classic cat-eye with a nude lip. 

Her pal was seen wearing an asymmetric neon green dress with golden heels while her male friend wore a matching white waterproof jacket and trouser combo with pale neon green panelling.

Jemma is never one to shy away from controversy, and previously defended using the N-word, citing the fact that her daughter is mixed-raced.

She shocked fans in December when she filmed herself singing along to a rap song, which used the slur.

After receiving a fierce backlash from her followers, Jemma hit back with a video claiming it was 'not her fault' as she was simply singing along to the lyrics, before referencing that she has black friends and also a mixed race child.

Jemma, who welcomed her first child in May 2019, shared a clip citing: 'So the moral of the story is, it's not my fault when the rappers use the N word in songs.'

Back in December 2018, Jemma stunned fans when she announced she was pregnant, and the controversial star admitted she debated not going through with having her first child yet decided to 'do the right thing'.

In her initial pregnancy announcement, she vowed to never reveal the father's identity after a secret two-year romance.

However, she has now divulged details of their 'toxic' relationship which included a kidnap attempt and bids to abort her child.

She welcomed her daughter on May 25, and has chosen not to disclose her baby girl's name or share any pictures of her face.
