Die-hard Jewish pilgrims have refused to leave Ukraine's border with Belarus after more than 1,000 give up hope and turn back due to coronavirus restrictions.  

 Orthodox-Jewish believers, including hundreds of children, have camped out throughout the week in no-man's land at the border crossing ahead of Jewish New Year celebrations this weekend.

Tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews travel to the central Ukrainian city of Uman every Jewish New Year to visit the tomb of Rabbi Nahman, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic movement.

The standoff between pilgrims and armed Ukrainian security services sparked tensions at the Novi Yarylovychi border crossing and inflamed a diplomatic row between Minsk and Kiev.

Ukrainian border guard spokesman Andriy Demchenko said earlier today that most pilgrims had returned to Belarus and only 'a few pilgrims' hoping to enter Ukraine remained at the crossing point.

Belarus, which earlier said the pilgrims should be allowed to visit holy sites in Ukraine, confirmed that fewer than a dozen people were attempting to cross.

Belarus's Border Committee representative Anton Bychkovskiy said pilgrims were 'leaving the border en masse' and travelling onwards to nearby cities by bus and taxi.

Both Ukraine and Israel are keen to avoid a spike in coronavirus infections.

Israel imposed a second nationwide lockdown on Friday to tackle one of the world's highest coronavirus infection rates, despite public protests over the new blow to the economy.

The three-week shutdown starts just hours before Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.

Meanwhile, up to 3,000 Hasidic Jews have arrived in Uman for the celebrations entering Ukraine before the ban, police said.

Law enforcement has tightened security near Rabbi Nachman's tomb where pilgrims have congregated.
