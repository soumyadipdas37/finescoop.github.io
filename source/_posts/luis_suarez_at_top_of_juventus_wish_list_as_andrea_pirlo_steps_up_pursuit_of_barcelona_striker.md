Juventus have stepped up their pursuit of Barcelona outcast Luis Suarez.

The Italian champions have considered a number of forwards this summer, and the Uruguayan has emerged as a top target, according to Goal.com

Suarez has been linked with MLS side Inter Miami and former club Ajax since being told he does not figure in the plans of new boss Ronald Koeman.

Koeman is looking to carry out a major summer overhaul following the humiliating Champions League exit to Bayern Munich earlier this month.

The Uruguay international could be joined out of the exit door at Barcelona by Lionel Messi, who is pushing for a move away on a free transfer.

The duo were spotted leaving a restaurant together on Wednesday night for the first time since the Argentine handed in a transfer request via fax to the Catalan giants.

Footage from El Chiringuito released on Thursday morning shows Messi leaving a restaurant in a black car while Suarez followed in a separate vehicle. 

Suarez - who is Barcelona's third highest goalscorer of all time - and Messi have been close friends since the striker moved from Liverpool in 2014.
