And on Tuesday's episode of The Project, Zoë, 40, was asked the most outrageous way the couple have been woken up in the middle of the night by their children.

'Rudy recently woke up my husband saying there was a spider in the bathroom, and he should come and see it for a shock,' Zoë told guest panellist Annika Smethurst.

'He is arachnophobic, so that was a wake-up call for him!' she continued.   

Zoë also revealed how Sonny once interrupted the couple watching a violent show on television, informing them of a hair clip he had found in his bed.

'Sonny came downstairs one night when we were watching a very violent show, which is always terrible,' she said.

'He just said he couldn't sleep because he found a hair clip in his bed.'   

The comments were in relation to Zoë's latest project, picture book Back to Sleep, 'that celebrates the ups and downs of family life'.

'I have a nanny who helps me three days a week, because if I didn't have those three days to work, I couldn't do any of this,' she said.

'My husband and I are a good team as well. I don't have an answer,' Zoë continued.

'I'm scattered and I get anxious and I get stressed like everybody. The best thing that I can do is compartmentalise.'
