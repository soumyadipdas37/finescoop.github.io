Heartbreaking footage has emerged showing a toddler's final moments just hours before he was run over and killed in a tragic accident that left his parents too devastated to talk.  

Spencer Roberts, 14 months, crawled out of his family home at about 7.30pm on Wednesday and on to a slip lane off the Calder Highway at Kangaroo Flat in Bendigo, 150km north of Melbourne. 

The 56-year-old driver - who was not speeding or under the influence - thought he had hit an animal, only to find Spencer critically injured on the road. 

The boy was rushed to hospital but couldn't be saved. 

His mother, Stacey Winning, shared a harrowing clip just hours before tragedy struck showing the giggling toddler trying on a new pair of Nike shoes on Wednesday afternoon.

His parents were heard encouraging him to walk confidently as he stumbled and clung to the wall.

'Are you walking? Are you walking with your new shoes on? Just walk like normal baby boy,' his father, Brad Roberts, could be heard saying in the video. 

Spencer was seen looking at his father's new shoes before attempting to climb into the box. 

'This boy blows my mind with how smart he is,' his mother captioned the video.
