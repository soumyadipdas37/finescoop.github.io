Kylie Jenner loves to twin with her young daughter Stormi. 

And the 23-yer-old showed there is a strong family resemblance between her and her two-year-old daughter. 

The Kylie Cosmetics mogul reposted a side-by-side comparison of her and Stormi around the same age, to her Instagram Stories on Tuesday.

In the photo Stormi and Kylie clearly have the same dark brown eyes, button nose and pouty lips. 

Stormi, who Kylie shares with ex Travis Scott, boasts thicker eyebrows and a bit rounder cheeks. 

The photo of the makeup brand owner looks ripped from the Kardashian Jenner archives and a family event as a young Kylie donned an event ready floral purple dress. 

While Stormi seemed to be cuddled up at home in a plush jacket.

Later in the day, Kylie shared snaps enjoying the pool at the Kardashian Jenner Palm Spring's home. 

She took a dip in a bandage style burnt red halter bikini top and used a filter to lighten the color of her eyes. 

Despite getting wet, Kylie kept all of her glamorous accessories on, as she recorded herself still wearing her thick gold bracelets, chain necklace and five earrings. 

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star recorded herself emerging from the water, with soaking wet hair and not a stitch of makeup on.

Behind her sat the peaceful golf course and trees that are often seen during the family's trips to Palm Springs.

Kylie recently returned to the United States following a short trip to Paris.  

She was spotted throughout the City of Lights, and also shared multiple snapshots from the photo to her Instagram.

Kylie took business meetings with executives from Coty Cosmetics, the company which bought a majority stake in Kylie Cosmetics, making her a near-billionaire.

However, the trip sparked outrage from some social media users over her trip for non-essential reasons in the midst of a pandemic. 

'You don't have to deal with COVID if ur rich,' sniped one fan in the comments of a post.

'Is the pandemic over for rich people? I just see them taking luxurious vacations to tropical places or Europe like how is Kylie Jenner in Paris rn I don't understand,' wrote another.

Another remarked, 'Kylie Jenner going to Paris during Covid while the rest of the world can't travel or visit family in other countries/states due to border restrictions just doesn't sit well with me.' 

Pandemic outrage: The trip sparked outrage from social media users, as she ignored California guidelines not to travel, and she seemed to have ignored EU travel bans on Americans

Kylie seemed to have ignored guidelines issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom restricting travel.

The state government's official website website currently urges people to only travel for 'urgent matters.'

There have been nearly 13,000 deaths from the pandemic in the state of California, with over 700,000 cases. 

In all of the US, 183,000 people have succumbed to COVID-19, while a stunning six million have tested positive for the illness
