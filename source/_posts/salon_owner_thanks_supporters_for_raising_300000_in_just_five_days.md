A San Francisco salon owner has thanked supporters for raising $300,000 in just five days after Nancy Pelosi broke Covid-19 rules for a blowout at her business. 

Erica Kious, the owner of eSalon SF, said she was forced to shutter her business after she received death threats in the wake of exposing the House Speaker's trip to her business last Monday. 

After footage of the Democrat's trip went viral a day later Kious told Tucker Carlson Wednesday that her business was 'done'.

Last week, Fox News released footage of Nancy Pelosi (pictured) inside eSalon SF when the business was closed over pandemic restrictions and without a mask 

A GoFundMe page that was set up in the wake of the scandal has now reached its target of $300,000. 

Kious thanked her supporters from 'all sides of the political spectrum' for their 'kindness' and 'generosity'. 

In an interview with Fox News, she said: 'I wish I could personally thank every person who sent me their prayers, words of encouragement and support, especially at a time when so many are struggling to make ends meet in their own lives.

'I am very humbled and grateful to have received such an outpouring of kindness, empathy and generosity from people I don't even know, and from all walks of life and all sides of the political spectrum. 

'It's a powerful reminder that the common things that bind us all together as Americans are far more meaningful and lasting than political and ideological differences that get so much attention and focus.'

She continued: 'Today, on Labor Day, we should all focus on celebrating the efforts and achievements of hard-working people everywhere.' 

Pelosi has said she was set up by the salon she visited on Monday, where video footage showed her getting her hair done while not wearing a face mask. Her stylist defended the speaker, suggesting the owner of eSalon had deliberately set up Pelosi and had authorized the controversial hair appointment.

But Kious has denied that, telling Fox News: '[Pelosi] had called the stylist, or her assistant did, and had made the appointment so the appointment was already booked so there was no way I could have set that up.

'And I've had a camera system in there for five years, I mean I didn't go in there and turn cameras on as soon as she walked in and set her up so that's absolutely false.'

On Thursday a tearful Kious again denied setting up Pelosi, adding: 'In fact, not only did I not set her up, her assertion that she is a victim and set up is totally false and outrageous.'

The fundraising campaign to help single mom-of-two Kious was set up by Nevada State GOP chairman Amy Tarkanian, according to The Washington Examiner. 

Her husband Danny has run for public office, gaining the support of Donald Trump Jr. and girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle who spoke at a 2018 fundraiser in support of the then Republican congressional candidate. 

Earlier Thursday last week Donald Trump mocked Pelosi, calling her 'crazy' and asking why a speaker could be 'so easily set up?'

Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany came out swinging at the top of her press briefing on Thursday, playing on a loop the footage showing Pelosi in the salon - hair wet, face mask around her neck - as she blasted the Speaker, accusing her of holding up negotiations on another round of coronavirus relief legislation to get her hair done. 

Jonathan DeNardo, the San Francisco cosmetologist who did Pelosi's hair before the city allowed salons to operate again, released a statement through his lawyer on Wednesday

Pelosi held a press conference in San Francisco last Wednesday to address her controversial visit, saying: 'I take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighborhood salon I've been to over the years many times, and when they said we're able to accommodate people, one person at a time, and that we can set up that time, I trusted that. 

'As it turns out, it was a setup,' she said. 

'It was a set up, and I take responsibility for falling for a setup,' she added. 

'I just had my hair washed. I don't wear a mask when I'm washing my hair. Do you wear a mask when you're washing your hair? I always wear a mask,' Pelosi said. 'And that picture is when I just came out of the bowl.' 

Jonathan DeNardo, the San Francisco cosmetologist who did Pelosi's hair before the city allowed salons to operate again, released a statement through his lawyer on Wednesday. 

'The fact that Ms. Kious is now objecting to Speaker Pelosi's presence at eSalon, and from a simple surface-level review of Ms. Kious' political leanings, it appears Ms. Kious is furthering a set-up of Speaker Pelosi for her own vain aspirations,' the statement read. 

'Ultimately, Ms. Kious authorized Mr. DeNardo to proceed with Speaker Pelosi's appointment,' it added.
