Reese Witherspoon has been getting in plenty of family time, while quarantining with her three children, sons Tennessee, 7, and Deacon, 16, and daughter Ava, 20.  

But the 44-year-old actress took some time away from her lively brood for some solo pampering at a luxury spa in Brentwood on Tuesday afternoon. 

As she was escorted inside by a member of her security team, the Big Little Lies star could be seen donning a floral dress and a wide-brimmed straw hat.

Her signature blonde hair was styled down, as she accessorized with a large gold necklace, white sneakers and an Apple Watch fastened around her wrist. 

The Oscar winner kept the majority of her famous face concealed behind an indigo face mask and a pair of chic black Ray-Ban sunglasses.  

Additionally, she kept a cozy cardigan positioned on top of her brown bag, in case it was chilly inside.

Her outing came just one day after sharing a slew of silly snaps of her youngest son hanging upside down around the house as he began online learning. 

In the three photos, Tennessee passed the time clinging to an array of household items. 

'Home school is going great,' Reese sarcastically captioned the photos, along with a wacky-face emoticon.

The first photo captured Tennessee upside down in a bat pose under her marble kitchen counter.

In the next photo, Tennessee struck the same pose upon the family's wooden kitchen table.

The final photo showed Tennessee impressively clinging upside down to the roof handle of his parent's car.

Tennessee is just one of countless young students continuing their studies from home, with in-person attendance at many California schools put on hold in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Reese revealed last week her son had begun home schooling as she shared a photo of him beginning his courses on a tablet.

'Online learning here we come!!! #backtoschool' she captioned the photo, along with emojis of a pencil and stack of books.

Reese may seem to have it all together under lockdown, but in March she candidly admitted that's not always the case.

The actress revealed how the family had been maintaining their boundaries while all working under the same roof.

'I definitely have good days and bad days,' she told Miley Cyrus on Bright Minded: Live With Miley.

'I think it's really important to designate space,' she continued. 'My husband and I are both working from home and all three kids are doing school online. So everybody has a room that has a little area and there's a privacy sign there, so when the privacy sign is on and your headphones are on, you can't interrupt.'

'You have to have rules on the wall for your family, just so we respect each other's space.'
