When it comes to cool, this icebreaker explorer yacht hits the sub-zero mark.

Ragnar, which underwent a 22-month makeover from an offshore supply vessel to a sleek pleasure cruiser, has hit the rental market with weekly charters starting from $525,000 (£394,046) per week.

And these incredible images show how the state-of-the-art 223.8 foot (68.2 metre) vessel can accommodate 12 guests, with standout features including grand Viking-inspired interiors, a helipad, a spa and a plethora of luxury toys from a three-person submersible to an all-terrain ATV.

The 223.8 foot (68.2 metre) vessel can accommodate 12 guests. Pictured, a view of one of the two very plush master suites 

The dining room is akin to a banqueting hall, with dark wood panelling, low lighting and an armoured life-size replica of Ragnar - complete with a sword - behind glass casing at the head of the 14-seat table

After days spent 'experiencing life at the edge of existence', Burgess Yachts suggests that guests can opt for some pampering at the yacht's spa centre (pictured), which includes a gym, massage room, sauna and steam room

Other pieces of equipment on board the eye-catching icebreaker, which has been designed to glide through ice up to 20 inches thick, include jet skis, snowmobiles, paddleboards, surfboards and waterskis. An Airbus EC145 helicopter can be added to the vessel by request for an additional charge. 

The photos released by Burgess Yachts, which is handling the charter, show Ragnar in action off the shores of Iceland and in the North Sea.

The helipad is visible on the top deck. Just behind, there is a family-sized jacuzzi and open-air pool area so that guests can soak up the otherwordly landscapes while they take a dip.

Moving indoors the interiors have an old-world feel, taking inspiration from the vessel's name after legendary Viking, Ragnar Lodbrok or Lothbrok.

Working fireplaces with carved wooden surrounds, oversized leather sofas, bookcases and four-poster beds complete the ancient castle look.

The owner told Burgess Yachts that one of the top places on the vessel is the 'extremely cool observation lounge with stunning views for whale watching'. 

They added: 'You can watch wildlife playing from the comfort and warmth of your armchair.'

Talking of sleep, there are two master suites on Ragnar including four double suites, a twin suite for staff and an office that converts into another twin suite.

After days spent 'experiencing life at the edge of existence', Burgess Yachts suggests that guests can opt for some pampering at the yacht's spa centre, which includes a gym, massage room, sauna and steam room.

They can then discuss their day's adventures in the cosy bar area, library or games room.

The vessel is described as being the perfect pick for those looking to experience a 'world of adventure and excitement', with 'bears', 'orca' and' untouched pistes of snow and ice' on the agenda.

Ragnar was originally built in 2012 as a working ice breaker called Sanaborg.

She was snapped up by a keen yachtsman who could see her potential as a luxury vessel able to navigate the most inhospitable landscapes.

Ragnar's interiors were designed by British yacht design studio RWD, while the body was converted by Dutch shipbuilding company, Icon Yachts.

Following her conversion, she is now able to operate in temperatures below minus 35 degrees Celsius and has a range of 6,000 nautical miles so she can explore the most remote areas of the planet.
