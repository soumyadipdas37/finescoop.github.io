She has been lending a hand at her many NYC shoe stores amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

And Sarah Jessica Parker donned a sweet look in a grey midi skirt on Thursday as she headed in to help out. 

The Sex And The City actress, 55, teamed her skirt with a dark blue long sleeve V-neck and dark blue pointed toe stilettos. 

Day of work: Sarah Jessica Parker donned a sweet look in a grey midi skirt on Thursday as she headed in to help out, in New York City 

Sarah was spotted carrying large shopping and tote bags out of her Midtown store. 

She was sure to wear a dark reusable face mask for protection and following guidelines amid the pandemic. 

Keeping her hands free, and matching her dark blue theme, she wore a small clutch strapped to her chest using a large pink strap.

Inside: Inside the shop she stood near a table display 

She promoted her appearance at the store on Instagram, sharing a photo standing in front of a red shoe table display.  

Sarah used shoe boxes to prop up a Macbook lap top with a ring light standing behind it. 

'Dateline New York City,' she captioned the photo. '54th between 5th and 6th. I'm here until my parent/teacher conference.'

Co-workers: She mingled with the workers of the shop and customers 

Helping: She made shoe selections for a customer and directed employees

A dedicated business owner, she is said to make weekly visits to her stores to check in. 

Inside she was photographed helping a customer try on shoes and pick new styles from the large collection.  

Writing on Instagram recently she said 'It was a lovely day. So nice to be in the shop with our customers (safely, 6 feet apart and with a mask!).' 

Good choice: Alongside a customer she pointed out good shoe options

Adding that she spoke 'to all those who called the boutique with questions and orders,' and even 'headed downtown' herself to deliver to a customer. 

'We will continue to offer same day Manhattan delivery,' Sarah wrote. 'As well as offering virtual sales appointments for anyone who isn't in New York or may not yet feel safe visiting us in store.'

Sarah has not let coronavirus completely stop her from expanding her shoe empire.

No task is too small: Last month she shared a photo of herself going through her shoe inventory while standing upon a box in her heels 

The actress actually opened her flagship boutique last month, and was on hand once again to meet customers on the very first day.

Precautions were taken to keep everyone safe, with only three shoppers allowed in at a time and hand sanitizer available. 

The SJP Collection was first launched in 2014, and not only includes footwear but handbags and fragrances.
