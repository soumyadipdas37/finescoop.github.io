NBA star Kevin Durant has unveiled Antoine Griezmann as Barcelona's new No 7.

Although his first season at the Nou Camp didn't go entirely to plan, Griezmann is set to play a prominent part for Barcelona this time around under new manager Ronald Koeman.

Griemzann wore the No 17 shirt last season but has now switched to No 7, which was vacant last campaign and was last worn by Philippe Coutinho, who is currently without a squad number.

Griezmann previously wore the No 17 shirt but has now been rewarded with a lower number

Durant, who wears the No 7 for the Brooklyn Nets, appeared in a video posted on Barcelona's Twitter account in which he is seen unveiling Griezmann's new shirt.

The video is accompanied by the following voiceover: 'New desires. New dreams. Same ambition. Welcome back number seven.'

Griezmann joined Barcelona from Atletico Madrid last year for £108million.   

Much was expected of the Frenchman in his first campaign at the club but he mustered only 15 goals in 48 appearances, with Barcelona ending the campaign without a trophy. 

There had been suggestions that Griezmann could leave Barcelona after Lionel Messi ended up staying at the club, but his change in squad number is the surest sign yet that he is still very much a prominent figure at the club.
