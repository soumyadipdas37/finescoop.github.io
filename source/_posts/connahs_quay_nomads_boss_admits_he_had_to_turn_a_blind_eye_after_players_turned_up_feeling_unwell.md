Manager Andy Morrison has revealed Connah's Quay Nomads 'had to turn a blind eye' after three players turned up 'unwell' prior to their clash with Dinamo Tbilisi.

The Europa League qualifying second round clash went ahead on Thursday night despite four of Nomads' players having tested positive for coronavirus beforehand.

The quartet, plus a fifth player who has yet to test positive, are currently self-isolating.

And Nomads' problems got worse after three more players turned up on Thursday night not feeling well amid the Covid-19 outbreak at the club.

'Three lads have turned up tonight and they're not well,' said Morrison.

'And it's like "lads I don't want to hear it. I can't hear it tonight that you're ill, please like you know. Let's just get through it".

'I've been told that before the game and we've had to turn a blind eye to it and then you would have never noticed that anyone there tonight wasn't feeling great.'  

After their preparations were thrown into chaos, there was heartbreak for Morrison and his side on Thursday against the Georgian outfit.

Nomads were agonisingly defeated 1-0 in the second round qualifying clash after a 97th minute penalty from Giorgi Gabedava sealed the win for the visitors.
