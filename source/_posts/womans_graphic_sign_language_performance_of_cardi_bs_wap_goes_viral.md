A woman has performed Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's hit 'WAP' in American Sign Language (ASL) - and the resulting footage is even more graphic than the song's raunchy music video. 

YouTube star Libbey Ketterer, 22, from Ohio, has more than 527,000 subscribers to her channel, The Daily Sign, where she posts footage of herself signing to popular music, including Taylor Swift's 'Lover' and Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call Me Maybe.'

But she had a surefire hit on her hand when she took on the highly-sexual lyrics to 'WAP' in a video she posted on her channel on August 28.

Going viral: Libbey Ketterer, 22, from Ohio, has performed Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's hit 'WAP' in American Sign Language (ASL

Hit: The YouTube star, who learned ASL in high school, has more than 527,000 subscribers to her channel, The Daily Sign, where she posts footage of herself signing to popular music

Considering that Ketterer has to sign 'wet a** p***y' multiple times in the chorus alone, it should come as no surprise that the performance is far more explicit than some of her previous videos. 

The most talked-about portion of the clip appears to be when she signs the lyrics: 'I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp / I wanna gag, I wanna choke / I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat.'

Ketterer shared a breakdown of that portion of the video on her TikTok page, explaining in the caption that it was the 'most commented-on part' of her 'WAP' cover.   

In the short clip, she detailed what classifiers — handshapes that show appearance, location, and movement — she used for the lyrics.

'CL-1 finger representing uvula, mouth open to indicate inside of mouth. Wiggling to indicate "dangly." CL-BJ Touch (aimed at uvula CL),' she wrote, adding that the emotion was 'nasty.' 

Raunchy: Considering the song's highly-sexual lyrics, Ketterer's latest clip is far more explicit than some of her previous videos

Popular cover: The YouTube clip has been viewed more than 1.1. million times

She also shared some of the clip on Instagram, while urging her followers to watch the full video on her channel.

'WAP. Full video with sound up on YouTube NOW,' she wrote. 'You have NO IDEA how long this took me. Plz give it a view plz.'  

Ketterer is not deaf, but she began learning ASL in high school. After she became more fluent, she launched her YouTube channel in December 2014. 

Her 'WAP' cover has been viewed more than 1.1 million times since she posted it, and some fans thought it was better than the hit's viral choreography. 

'Why does this look better with the song rather than the actual dance?' one person wrote, while another commented: 'This just looks like a dope dance, better than TikToks.'

Others noted that the clip was actually more raunchy than the original song, with one commenting: 'This look[s] more sexual then the actual song!' 

Another chimed in: 'You made it "look" exactly as dirty and nasty as it is, which is amazing omg.' 

'I'm cackling how equally dirty the ASL version looks compared to the spoken language,' a third person wrote, while another admitted: 'My mouth dropped because it’s so dramatic and clearly sexual.'

Ketterer isn't the only one who has gone viral for her ASL cover of 'WAP,' however. Three weeks before, Raven Sutton, 25, tweeted a video of herself signing the song's lyrics while dancing to the music.  

The 34-second clip has been viewed more than 146,000 times and was even retweeted by Cardi B herself.

Doing it first: Raven Sutton, a 25-year-old who was born deaf, went viral with a video of herself signing the song's lyrics three weeks before Ketterer released her cover

Another hit: The 34-second clip has been viewed more than 146,000 times and was even retweeted by Cardi B herself

Sutton, who is known as @Freelove19xx on social media, was born deaf and ASL is her native language. 

She told Fierce by mitú that she hopes her video will show viewers that members of the Deaf community are just like everyone else.    

'It’s a common assumption that Deaf people can’t do certain things because we can’t hear. Things like talking, dancing, listening to music, etc,' she explained. 'Truth is, us Deaf people enjoy the same things as everyone else. 

'We ask to be included and accommodated so that the things we enjoy do not become a burden. Examples of accommodations are providing ASL interpreters, caption your videos, and learn ASL. Accessibility is important. Let’s all put in the work together.'
