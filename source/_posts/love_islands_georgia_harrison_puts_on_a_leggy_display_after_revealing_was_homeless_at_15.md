Georgia said: 'I did end up in a situation where I was living with my friend and her sister on their sofa when I was 15, so my school got in touch with a charity and they managed to house me without me going into social care.

'I was really scared and I didn't know what to do with myself, but when you hit rock bottom like that it puts you at a point where there's nowhere to go but up and that's where you find out how resilient you can be.'

She said that between the ages of 15 and 18 she lived in the shared accommodation and was still attending school during the first year.
