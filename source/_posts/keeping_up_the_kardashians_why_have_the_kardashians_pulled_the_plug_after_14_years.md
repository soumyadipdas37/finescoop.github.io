Keeping Up With The Kardashians was once a ratings hit for E! and over the past 14 years the show has forged the careers of Kim and her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie and Kendall, catapulting them to household name status.

However alongside the show's stratospheric success, it has been plagued by unwanted drama, including Kim's husband Kanye West's very public meltdown, family members refusing to film and public backlash.

While viewership has dwindled and the families' pay-cheque has only increased, it has been long-questioned how long the show will continue to be filmed.

Now the famous family have finally decided to call it quits on the long-running programme with no public reason behind their decision, we take a look at the possible reasons behind it's departure.

Time to say goodbye! Now the family have finally decided to call it quits on the long-running programme with no public reason behind their decision, we take a look at the possible reasons behind its departure

Concerns were sparked for Kim's husband Kanye West, who struggles with bipolar disorder, earlier this year after he announced his bid to run for presidency in the U.S. in the November elections.

Protecting her man: Kim refused to film anything linked to her husband's very public meltdown

The Kardashian family were reportedly 'very concerned' about Kanye, who appeared to be 'in the middle of a serious biopolar episode' and posted countless Twitter rants during the same period.

Fears for Kanye were also raised following a controversial Forbes interview, where he slammed Planned Parenthood for being run by 'white supremacists to do the Devil's work', drawing widespread criticism online.

TMZ previously claimed the father-of-four suffers from a serious episode around once a year, resulting in his decision-making being impacted.

The site reported: 'Kanye announced he's running for president via Twitter over the weekend, and also did a rambling interview with Forbes ... which drew harsh criticism, confusion and concern. 

'Our sources say his family and those close to him are worried, but they believe things will stabilise as they have in the past. The problem here, is that Kanye's proclamations are causing problems.'

At the time, Kim was pictured filming scenes for Keeping Up With The Kardashians on the same day she publicly addressed her husband's bipolar battle with an Instagram statement saying 'her family is powerless'.

A source revealed that Kim doesn't want her reality TV series to document any of Kanye's bipolar episode. Kim has also banned the show from profiling her children during this time in case they watch it later.

With tensions growing at home for Kim, it may be one of the reasons behind their decision to finally call it quits on their hugely popular reality show.

It has been well-reported in recent years that TV ratings for the Kardashian's show have dwindled in comparison to the programme's late noughties hey day, when it attracted more than four million live viewers.

Following it's premiere in 2007 the attention-grabbing reality show was continually on the rise until it reached it's peak three years later during the season four finale in February 2010, which pulled in 4.8 million viewers.

However NBCUniversal's E! network may no longer want to pay top dollar for a show now its live viewership has dropped by more than 3 million viewers.

The 18th and most recent season of the E! stalwart, which was cut short due to the coronavirus outbreak, enticed just 1 million viewers during it's premiere earlier this year. Falling by 400,000 compared to the previous series.

Other episodes from the series, which featured a physical fight between sisters Kim and Kourtney, fell to between 871,000 and 910,000 viewers.

Diminishing viewership may be down to fan's ability to follow the drama in real-time through online news outlets social media. The world new about Tristan Thompson cheating on Khloe with family friend Jordyn Woods months before it played out on the show. 

Eunice Shin, a partner at brand and business consultancy Prophet, told the LA Times: 'Their relevance is not on TV, their relevance is on Snapchat and social media. They are absolute brand marketers, and that's what they exist for. They don't necessarily need television to do that.' 



Due to the decline in ratings it may be called into question whether the network still values KUWKT as one of it's top earners, after dominating E! for the past 14 years.

It was previously reported by TMZ that the family was said to be pocketing $30 million a season for 5 seasons, which comes to $150 million, after they signed a renewal deal with the network in 2017.

Their previous five-season contract which was signed in 2015 reportedly offered the family $20 million per season. Meaning that network bosses have forked out $250million on the family over 10 years.

The season 18 premiere saw Kim and Kourtney engage in a savage brawl and fans were quick to turn on the siblings for filming the negative behaviour for their show.  

The Skims founder slapped her big sister multiple times after Kourtney, came at Kim and screamed repeatedly 'I will f**k you up!', after Kim criticised her work ethic. 

While the sisters made light of the moment on social media following the drama, with Kourtney tweeting: ''Kourtney 'the nail digger' Kardashian weighing in at 108 pounds...Kim 'the kicker' Kardashian West weighs in at 128 pounds…', fans were left unimpressed by the fight. 

Kourtney agreed with a fan who branded the situation 'cringe-worthy' and trash'.   

One fan tweeted: 'Kourtney is so negative. Like you had a choice not to be on this season. Why are you filming if you don't want to be there?! It is so draining to watch. She must need the E! checks, why else? And she got physically with Kim first.'

Another chimed in: 'Yo I didn't know Kimberly had it in her. She done told y'all 'don't be f***king rude' Go Kim! I think Kourtney really resents Kim for her success both career wise and personal life. She has alot of insecurities and built up hate which is clear to see,' a watcher criticized.

'Don't get me wrong, Kim can be a b***h but Kourtney always plays victim and cries. She needs to get off the show and focus on her happiness.

'This negative s**t is not a good look. Every season same s**t,' a fan wrote.

Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show is ending after 14 years on air.

Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which helped make Kim and her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie and Kendall household names and launched their careers in the fashion and beauty business, will air its last season early next year.

There was no reasons for the decision but E! said in a statement that it respects 'the family's decision to live their lives without our cameras.' In recent years numerous siblings, most recently Kourtney, have been reluctant to film the show. Kim has also endured a turbulent year with her husband Kanye West's mental health battle and controversial presidential run putting unprecedented strain on her marriage.

Throughout the years the show chronicled key events in the personal and professional lives of the California family, including Kim Kardashian's marriages to Kris Humphries and West, an armed robbery in Paris, the break-up of Khloe Kardashian's marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom, and the transition of family patriarch Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner.   

In an Instagram message posted on Tuesday, Kim, 39, wrote: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

Shock announcement: Kim Kardashian revealed her family has made the 'difficult decision' to end Keeping Up With The Kardashians 

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. 

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.

Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives. 

'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'

'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'

Family statement: After Kim Kardashian posted, her family members quickly followed suit with a similar statement signed from the whole gang 

Emotional: Khloe poured her heart out on Twitter following the news 

The E! networks added in a statement, 'E! has been the home and extended family to the Kardashian-Jenners for what will be 14 years, featuring the lives of this empowering family.'

'Along with all of you, we have enjoyed following the intimate moments the family so bravely shared by letting us into their daily lives.'

'While it has been an absolute privilege and we will miss them wholeheartedly, we respect the family's decision to live their lives without our cameras. It is not our final goodbye yet, we are excited to have the new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians launching on September 17 with the final season airing in 2021.

The statement concluded: 'We thank the entire extended family and our production partners, Bunim Murray and Ryan Seacrest Productions for embarking on this global phenomenon together.'

A similar statement to the one posted by Kim was then released by the family, which was signed off from Kris, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Rob, Kendall, Kylie and Scott. 

Khloe also tweeted: 'The emotions are overflowing today... change is tough but sometimes needed. I can't express how much I love and appreciate you guys.'

Caitlyn Jenner was not included in the statement however.   

While the show has undoubtedly had an extraordinary run, its more recent series have suffered poor ratings. 

In April this year, it was reported that viewership had sunk to 871,000 viewers, making that episode the 4th lowest rated episode ever.

At its peak, KUWTK earned E! its most-watched day ever, when 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries - the episode, Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event - Part 2, aired in 2011.

The show also had an endless supply of celebrity guest stars over the years, but most notably there were appearances from Hugh Hefner, Mel B, Kobe Bryant, Lindsay Lohan, Serena Williams, and even TV legend Oprah Winfrey. 

The series famously gained momentum after Kim gained notoriety for starring in a leaked, home-made sex tape with singer Ray J. 

Porn company Vivid Entertainment bought the rights to the tape for $1 million, and released the film under the title Kim Kardashian, Superstar in February.  

Breaking the news: Kim was the first person to reveal the show's demise, as she has always been the star of the series

Kim would later sue Vivid for ownership of the tape, but ended up settling for a reported $5 million. 

The controversy and notoriety surrounding the tape helped propel the start of the reality series. 

Ryan Seacrest decided to develop the idea after meeting with Kris Jenner, and has wanted to emulate the success of the popular family reality show The Osbournes.

Journey: Kim has shared most of her adult life so far on the show, including snippets of her wedding to husband Kanye West 

Famous: The show has certainly had a boost from the appearance of her husband Kanye West

Thank you and goodnight! It will be interesting to see if the famous family find a new TV home for their shenanigans 

Kim described the beginning of filming the show in an interview, saying: 'When we first started [the show], we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'' 

Despite getting a bashing from the critics over the years, the reality series was nominated for, and won, several television awards. 

KUWTK has received nominations for a Teen Choice Award in the Choice TV: Celebrity Reality Show category nine consecutive times between 2008 and 2016, winning the award in 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2016. 

The show also won a People's Choice Award as Favorite TV Guilty Pleasure in 2011.

Look how fart they've come! When the family first started it seemed unfathomable that they would one day be invited to the Met Gala (pictured above last year) 

E! has previously stated that the show averages about 1 million viewers between the ages of 18 and 49.  

There have been 12 spin-off series on E! including, Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Kourtney and Khloe Take the Hamptons, Khloe and Lamar, Sex with Brody, I Am Cait, DASH Dolls, Life of Kylie, Rob & Chyna, Revenge Body with Khloe Kardashian and Flip It Like Disick.

However, as the viewership has dipped, the family's social media presence has only grown stronger - which could explain why fans are flocking to their Instagram Stories to get their fix, instead of the television show.

Between Kim, Kris, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall, Kylie and Rob - the main family members collectively have over 782.4 million followers on Instagram alone. 

In May this year, streaming giant Netflix showed interest in the series as it announced it would be showing the series in the UK. 

It will certainly be interesting to see if the famous family decide to find a new home for their group shenanigans, or if they'll got their separate ways.

Keeping Up With The Kardashians was a ratings winner right out of the gate when it premiered in October 2007 on cable network E!.

It had been pitched by mom-of-six Kris Jenner to  TV host and producer Ryan Seacrest who was looking to bring a fly-on-the-wall show to E! following the huge success of MTV's The Osbournes that ran from 2002 to 2005.

Kris persuaded him that she and her children - three daughters and a son with former O.J. Simpson defense attorney Robert Kardashian and two daughters with Olympic decathlete Bruce Jenner - would be a perfect fit. 

Fly on the wall: Keeping Up With The Kardashians was a ratings winner right out of the gate when it premiered in October 2007 on cable network E!

A few months before the first episode was set to air, a sex tape featuring Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian was leaked, generating headlines and interest in the 27-year-old.

She had made the tape in 2002 with then boyfriend Ray J but the timing of its release five years later couldn't have been better timed. 

The publicity surrounding the sex tape considerably raised Kim's public profile; until then she was best known for being an assistant to Simple Life star and hotel heiress Paris Hilton. 

Timing: Kris Jenner masterminded the reality show and a few months before the first episode aired, a sex tape starring her daughter Kim was leaked, generating huge interest in the series

The E! series made global stars of Kim and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian as well as her half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. 

In the past 13 years, they have grown up on camera, sharing their life and loves, heartache and happiness, their changing faces and changing bodies, and the births of their own children.

More than that, though, they have taken TV fame and spun it into a huge money-making empire, with a lot of help from social media and some very clever marketing.

They mastered the art of keeping hundreds of millions of Twitter and Instagram users engaged with multiple posts a day and then found ways to make money from it.

They used their platforms to sell everything from makeup and perfume to waist trainers and underwear, while also striking lucrative endorsement deals and signing up for high-paid public appearances.  

Throughout it all, Kris has managed her children's careers, taking 10 percent of their earnings in addition to her own fees from the TV show and its spin-offs.

While KUWTK may be coming to an end after 20 seasons, there's no doubt we haven't heard the last of the momager, her kids and grandkids. 

Kylie Jenner - KUWTK made her a billionaire (well, almost) 

She is the youngest of Kris Jenner's six children but she's also now the richest.

Kylie Jenner, 23, is the youngest but richest of the KUWTK stars

Kylie, 23, made the cover of Forbes magazine in 2019 as the 'the world's youngest self-made billionaire' after she sold 51 percent of her Kylie Cosmetics company to beauty giant Coty in a deal valued at $1.2 billion.

Forbes subsequently retracted the 'billionaire' title reckoning that, in reality, she was only worth an estimated $900 million.

Kylie's personal wealth came thanks mainly to her decision to start getting lip fillers when she was 18. And while she initially denied getting enhancements, she later acknowledged it and launched a collection of lip kits in 2015.

The following year, due to the tremendous success of her initial products, she launched Kylie Cosmetics. 

Kylie has also partnered with sister Kendall in a clothing line, founded her own skincare line, Kylie Skin, and released her own fragrance through half-sister Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty.  

Kim Kardashian - Game app, shapewear and beauty products add up to $900 million

It can certainly be argued that without her sex tape, she and her family might never have achieved unimaginable wealth.

But while Kim Kardashian Superstar raised her profile, Kim, 39, made sure to capitalize on every opportunity that came her way subsequently.

Kim, 29, earns up to  a rumored $1 million for a paid Instagram post

Unquestionably the star of her family's reality show, her televised 2011 wedding to NBA pro Kris Humphries was a ratings blockbuster. Her divorce and subsequent marriage to rapper Kanye West kept fans fascinated by her private life.

Forbes estimates Kim's fortune to be $900 million.

In 2014, she launched mobile game app Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and it made $1.6 million in the first five days after its release. In 2015, she released her own range of Kimojis.

In addition to her TV fees, paid endorsements and appearances, the bulk of Kim's wealth comes thanks to her KKW Beauty company. 

In 2019, the Product line raked in $100 million and she gained $200 million by selling a 20 percent stake in the company to Coty, the same company that bought Kylie's brand. 

Her SKIMS shapewear launched last year is also a huge revenue generator and she can earn up to $1 million for a paid Instagram post. 

Kris Jenner - the momager takes her cut to the tune of $90 million (at the very least) 

As her daughters' manager, Kris, 64, get a 10 percent cut of each of their earnings

Kris, 64, is the mastermind behind everything Kardashian, and that's how she makes her fortune.

In 2018, Forbes reckoned her net worth to be $37.5 million but it's certainly grown plenty since then with some placing her true net worth at somewhere between $90 and $140 million.

The bulk of her income comes from her 10 percent fees as the manager of her children's careers.

She also has stakes in some of her kids' companies; for example, when Kylie sold her cosmetics company in 2019, Kris pocketed $60 million from the deal, Forbes reported.

Khloe Kardashian - denim and workouts bring her an estimated $50 million

Khloe Kardashian, 36, has dramatically transformed her look during the series

Khloe, 36, has carved out her own niche in the Kardashian family marketplace.

She is perhaps the sister who has most transformed their look in recent years, almost to the point of being unrecognizable.

Her fitness regimen in the wake of her divorce from Lamar Odom helped land her her own TV show Revenge Body, and she also hosted the TV chat show Kocktails With Khloe.

In 2016, she founded Good American, which began with a line of jeans and has since expanded to include bodysuits, activewear and swimwear. 

Kourtney Kardashian - lifestyle website helps Poosh her earnings to upwards of $35 million

Kourtney Kardashian, 41, makes most of her money from the TV show

Kourtney, 41, the eldest of the Kardashian siblings, is most reliant on the TV show for her income.

However, like her sisters, she makes money with paid product endorsements and paid Instagram posts.

In 2017 she partnered with fashion retailer Pretty Little Thing.

Then last year, Kourtney launched her lifestyle website Poosh where companies can sell their products directly to consumers attracted to Kourtney's brand.  

Kendall Jenner - modeling career enhanced TV fame for $30 million net worth

Kendall Jenner, 24, earns millions from her modeling career

Kendall, 24, turned her attention several years ago to trying to fulfill her dream of becoming a fashion model.

Thanks to her TV and social media celebrity, she won contracts with some of the world's top brands making her the highest-paid model of 2018, according to Forbes.

Forbes estimated her net worth at $22.5 million but it's only increased since then.

She has also teamed up with younger sister Kylie for clothing, jewelry and swimwear lines and like the rest of her sisters, she gets plenty of paid endorsement work.

Rob Kardashian - sporadic TV appearances net him $10 million

Rob, 33, is the only boy in the family of girls and has played a much more low-key role in the KUWTK world.

Initially featuring on the reality show, he subsequently retreated from the spotlight as he battled a number of health issues.

He had his won sock company Arthur George and in 2016, he agreed to star in a spin-off Rob & Chyna, that followed his relationship with fiancee Blac Chyna and the birth of their daughter Dream.

His estimated $10 million net worth comes mostly from his TV appearance fees. 

 

Keeping Up With The Kardashians just announced it will be ending next year after 20 seasons on TV. 

And while plenty of things have changed for the superstar family in the past 14 years, nothing has evolved as much as the sisters' looks.

Since 2007 Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian went from wild 20-somethings with heavy eyeliner habits to chic, contour-savvy CEOs and moms.

At the same time Kendall and Kylie Jenner grew-up in front of the camera, transforming from awkward preteens into their ultra glamorous selves of today.

Though it's undeniable that styles - and budgets - have changed since the start, many think the ladies have had a little extra help throughout the seasons.

The girls began to flaunt fuller lips, changing curves and ever-thinning noses as the years went on.

While Kim and company have kept coy about their procedures, the sisters have fueled more than a few cosmetic surgery trends along the way, prompting fans to flock to their doctors to get that Kardashian-plump pout or Kim-inspired derriere.
