Nina Agdal and her boyfriend Jack Brinkley-Cook looked happy in love, as they shared a kiss in East Hampton on Saturday. 

After hosting an intense full-body workout class, the 28-year-old Danish catwalk star slid off her mask to lock lips with her beau of three years. 

The son of legendary supermodel Christie Brinkley, 25, appeared to be on his way to a workout of his own, as he held onto the handles of his lime green bike.

Meanwhile, the Sports Illustrated cover girl was left looking smitten, as she stood by her car with a giddy grin across her face.

As the businessman rode off, Agdal looked off in the distance and displayed her gym-honed midriff in a bright red sports bra and black biker shorts. 

The sporty ensemble flaunted her sensational figure, while she opted to toss her signature blonde tresses in a sleek bun.

In addition to her popular fitness and nutrition app, she has been recently documenting herself leading in-person training sessions at The Reform Club. 

The bombshell could be seen working up a sweat in front of a crowd, at the location not far from where she's been hunkering down during quarantine.  

Both Nina and Jack have been staying at his mother's home, which includes an observation tower that has stood for over a century.

Nina first became an international sensation during her relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is 17 years older than she.

The pair of them split in 2017 when Nina was 25, and he is now dating 23-year-old blonde Camila Morrone, whose mother used to date Al Pacino.

In June, Nina rang in her third anniversary with Jack by posting a sweet album that showed them cuddling up and kissing during a beach picnic.

She gushed: '3 years later. Still on a beach. Still drinking wine. Still cracking jokes no one else would find funny.'

Jack's biological father is Christie Brinkley's third husband Richard Taubman, but he was adopted by her fourth husband Peter Cook, who is not to be confused with the English comedian of the same name.

Christie also has two daughters - Sailor, 22, by Peter, and Alexa, 34, whom she shares with her second ex-husband, singing star Billy Joel.
