All bets are currently off with Tom Hardy tipped to be the next James Bond when Daniel Craig finally hands over the keys to the Aston Martin. 

But the man in question was light years away from the clean shaven secret agent as he stepped out in London on Tuesday. 

The British actor, 43, revealed the makings of a greying beard while picking up some snacks from a local garage.

Wearing a relaxed T-shirt from military charity We Defy Foundation, Tom also exposed a near-full sleeve tattoo that would even prompt Bond to raise a quizzical eyebrow. 

The actor added to his casual look with a pair of cropped black jogging bottoms, while running shoes rounded things off. 

Tom has been one of the bookies favourites to become the next 007 in recent years, and rumours have been circulating he will step into Craig's shoes after his fifth and final film, No Time To Die.

The Vulcan Reporter claims that Hardy had been offered the iconic part after a successful audition, while bookies odds on the star have now been slashed in half.

The publication reports producers had planned to unveil Tom as James Bond in November- the same month No Time To Die was due to be released.

However, due to the coronavirus pandemic the Vulcan Reporter state the announcement will now be made later this year or early 2021.

Meanwhile, the bookies have slashed odds on The Peaky Blinders star from 8/1 to just 4/5 in the past 24 hours after a flurry of bets.

Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: 'A flurry of bets over the past 24 hours suggests the cat is out the bag and it's Tom Hardy that'll soon be replacing Daniel Craig as 007.'

MailOnline has contacted Tom's representatives and EON Productions for comment.

The Taboo star has made no secret about wanting to be the next 007 - but has previously refused to talk about the part in fear it will get him blacklisted.

Speaking to the Daily Beast, the heart-throb admitted: 'If I mention it, it's gone.

'You know, there's a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting, and in the fellowship of my peer group, that if you talk about it you're automatically out of the race.

'So I can't possibly comment on that one!'
