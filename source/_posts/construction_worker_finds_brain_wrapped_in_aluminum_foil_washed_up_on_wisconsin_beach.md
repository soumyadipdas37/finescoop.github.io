A Wisconsin construction worker taking a morning stroll along a beach in search of a peace of mind got more than he bargained for yesterday when he found a brain wrapped in foil washed up on the shoreline.

Jimmy Senda, of Racine, was partaking in his daily walking ritual along the shore of Lake Michigan, near to Samuel Myers Park, on Tuesday when he made the horrifying discovery.

Senda, who’s a part-time artist, says he regularly combs beaches in the area in search of interesting items such as sea glass to incorporate into his sculptures.

And the 47-year-old was understandably intrigued when he spotted a package, wrapped in aluminium foil and fastened with a pink rubber band, close to the water's edge.

‘Curiosity got to me, so I popped it open and it looked like a chicken breast,’ Senda told FOX6. ‘It took a little bit for it to really [register] of what was going on; it was a brain.’

Senda said he was so dumbfounded by the discovery his own brain struggled to comprehend precisely what was unfolding

Also concealed in the bizarre package were two light-pink flower heads and what appeared to be Chinese currency, he said.

Senda said he was so dumbfounded by the discovery that his own brain struggled to comprehend precisely what was unfolding.

‘I don't really know how to explain it, it didn't register...I was just like, “What is this?”’ he continued.

The construction worker then consulted with some city workers nearby who concluded, ‘”Yeah, that’s a Brain,”’ as he recalled it.

Senda then called police who made the same determination. The officers then took the brain away from the scene to investigate further.

Cops have since said they don’t believe the brain is human, but are awaiting official confirmation from the Racine County Medical Examiner’s Office.

A spokesperson from the examiner's office told DailyMail.com: 'We definitely know it's an animal brain, we're just not certain what kind yet.' 

 Early signs in the investigation suggest it could be a cat brain, according to TMZ.

He found the brain wrapped in aluminum foil, secured by a rubber band, close to the water 

Also concealed in the bizarre package were two light-pink flower heads and what appeared to be Chinese money, according to Senda

Senda, meanwhile, told FOX6 he normally walks the beaches further north and said it has been a while since he had been to Myers Park

While Examiner’s Office continues their probe, Semba’s disturbing discovery has been blowing minds on social media.

‘Just when you thought 2020 couldn’t get any more f***ed up,’ said one commenter on Senda’s original Facebook post, documenting what he found.

‘Is there a cannibal running around,’ added another.

While many voiced fears the brain was human, others voiced scepticism from the beginning that it appeared to be a pig brain, or another animal, due to the scale of the encephalon compared to his hands.

‘Why won’t you say what the police said,’ one user scoffed. ‘It’s obviously not a FULL GROWN human brain.’

Multiple other disturbed viewers theorized the brain may have been used in some form of sacrificial worship.  

Senda, meanwhile, told FOX6 he normally walks the beaches further north and said it has been a while since he had been to Myers Park.

He said that on some level he’s glad it was him who made the discovery.

‘There’s a lot of kids and families that are down here, and what happens if a kid would have found it?’ he said.
