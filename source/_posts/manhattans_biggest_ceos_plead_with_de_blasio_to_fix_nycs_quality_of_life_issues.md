de Blasio took to Twitter and shared that he was grateful for the business community for helping 'rebuild a fairer, better city.'

'Let’s be clear: To restore city services and save jobs, we need long term borrowing and a federal stimulus — we need these leaders to join the fight to move the City forward,' he said. 

The letter comes as fewer than 10 per cent of New York City's office employees have returned to public workplaces, jeopardizing the city's financial health as office buildings account for almost 10 per cent of total annual revenue.  

Optimists hoped that the city's one million office workers would return to skyscrapers as the pandemic progressed, but reports show that is simply not the case. 

The 'Return to Office Survey' released by Partnership for New York City found that just eight per cent of staffers have returned to the office as of mid-August. 

Employers have lowered their expectations since May by 33 per cent, with only 26 per cent of surveyed employees scheduled to return by the year's end.

That number jumps just over half - or 54 per cent - for a July 2021 return date.

Crime in the Big Apple has also been on the rise, the New York Daily News reports, with shootings up 89.6 per cent compared to Jan 1 to September of last year.

Additionally, the Sanitation and Parks departments have reduced trash pickup and there has been an increase in homeless being housed in the city's hotels.
