Earlier in the day, Molly-Mae revealed she's stuck in angry ongoing dispute with her elderly neighbours.

Molly-Mae and Tommy moved into their £1.3 million apartment in Cheshire back in June, but have struggled to settle. 

In a series of Instagram Stories on Tuesday, Molly-Mae confessed that she's too 'scared' to use the communal bins in the building after clashing with her neighbours about recycling.

She began by sharing a picture of a mountain of cardboard boxes in her hallway that she had been unable to clear due to the row.   

She captioned the post: 'One weeks worth of cardboard. Our neighbours hate us (me) so we are too scared to use the bins here. Skip run it is.'

After being bombarded with questions from fans, Molly-Mae went on to share a lengthy video explaining exactly what had happened. 

Oh dear: She began by sharing a picture of a mountain of cardboard boxes in her hallway that she had been unable to clear due to the row

The YouTuber began: 'Right excuse the fact that I look like a Stig of the Dump this morning but all of you want the juicy gossip on why the neighbours hate us so guess what I'm going to give it to you... 

'It's going to be a massive let down by the way. Like it's a really boring story but here we go anyway.

'So it's all to do with recycling! Told you. Yeah told you it was going to be a massive let down.'

Unsettled: In a series of Instagram Stories on Tuesday, Molly-Mae confessed that she's too 'scared' to use the communal bins in the building after clashing with her neighbours 

She explained: 'Basically the neighbours are just very, very set in their ways here about how they like things recycled, there's about 175,000 different bins for each different material that you have to adhere to otherwise it's literally world war three and when I mean world war three, I mean world war three.

'We've had them running up to us in the car park shouting at us, letters shoved under our door, strongly worded emails, all within the space of about three months of living here which is obviously really nice and welcome and nice house warming present from the neighbours...

'But I think they're all just very set in their ways, they've lived here for a long time, they're like all over the age of 65 I think.' 

Advice: Molly-Mae went on to ask her followers to share their stories on disputes with neighbours in order to 'make her feel better' about her own predicament

She continued: 'Sorry if you're watching this and I've offended you, but yeah I think the new kids on the block just aren't really welcome.

'They kind of would rather we weren't here, but yeah I think we just need to get a little bit better at recycling and hopefully, hopefully it'll pass, I don't think it will.

'Yeah but this place isn't a permanent home for us, I think this has made us realise why we want to live by ourselves, it's so hard to keep neighbours happy all the time.' 

Molly-Mae went on to ask her followers to share their stories on disputes with neighbours in order to 'make her feel better' about her own predicament. 

Molly-Mae and Tommy moved into their Cheshire apartment over the summer, one week after their beloved Pomeranian puppy, Mr Chai, died at their home in Manchester, as they sought a fresh start.
