Dr. Dre's business associate Larry Chatman is accusing the rapper's estranged wife Nicole Young of stealing money from a business account on two occasions.

Record One studio co-founder Larry Chatman, according to TMZ, has had his legal team correspond with Young over two transactions involving the business account: one last month in the amount of $353,000, then another for $31,457.

Young's name was removed from the account before the latter withdrawal, and she had no legal access to the funds, according to Chatman's lawyers.

Young's lawyer Bryan Freedman said that the latest move from Dr. Dre's camp amounted to 'a clear attempt to smear Nicole's name,' telling the outlet she was authorized to the funds she withdrew amid the marital split.

'As people are well aware, banks do not give out money to people who are not authorized to receive it,' Freedman told the outlet. 

He previously told TMZ that Dr. Dre's complaints about the initial transaction amounted to a 'low-grade PR stunt' intended to distract from the details of the divorce.

Young filed for divorce from The Next Episode artist earlier this summer after 24 years of marriage, as they share two children - son Truice Young, 23 and daughter Truly Young, 19. 

 The former N.W.A. member and Young have been at odds over a prenuptial agreement, according to the outlet

The Been There, Done That artist and Young have been at odds over a prenuptial agreement, according to the outlet.

Nicole, who was previously wed to NBA player Sedale Threatt, said she initially signed one, but Dr. Dre later destroyed it during the better times in the marriage.

The Beats Electronics founder in court docs has claimed full possession over the family's $1 billion and property, leading Young to request $1 million to 'maintain the financial status quo.'
