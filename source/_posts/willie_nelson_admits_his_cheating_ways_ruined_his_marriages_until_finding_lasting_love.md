Willie Nelson opens up about his past marital infidelities in his new book Me and Sister Bobbie.

Nelson, 87, writes about how she cheated on his second wife Shirley Collie after having a daughter out of wedlock, Page Six reported Wednesday.

The On The Road Again singer said that Collie found a piece of mail from a hospital in Houston letting her know something was up.

The latest: Willie Nelson, 87, opens up about his past marital infidelities in his new book Me and Sister Bobbie. He was snapped last year in Texas 

'I tried to play it off as no big deal,' he said. 'I told her that I had to go to the hospital for something minor.'

The country icon said that 'Shirley wasn’t buying that for one simple reason,' as 'the bill said the charges were for the birth of a baby girl, Paula Carlene, born to a Mrs. Connie Nelson.'

Nelson said that he 'was caught flat-footed' and 'couldn’t lie' to Collie when she pressed him on the identity of Connie Nelson (who was his girlfriend Connie Kopek).

He wrote: 'Had to get the words out of my mouth: "Connie’s my girlfriend and Paula’s our daughter."'

Lasting love: Willie and wife Annie, snapped in 2013, have been married 29 years 

Path to paradise: Nelson eventually found his true love with Annie Marie D’Angelo, who he met when she was working as a makeup artist on his 1986 TV film Stagecoach 

Nelson went on to split with Collie in 1971 and married Kopek, though he 'still hadn’t reformed' when it came to his roving eye.

'I messed up another marriage,' he said. 'My wandering ways were too much for any woman to put up with.'

He said he eventually found his true love with Annie Marie D’Angelo, who he met when she was working as a makeup artist on his 1986 TV film Stagecoach.

Celebration: Nelson in April celebrated 4/20 with Come and Toke It, a benefit concert with proceeds aimed at Last Prisoner Project, a marijuana legalization group 

He hosted the streaming musical event with his son Lukas

'My love for Annie was all-consuming, but winning her over wasn’t easy. She had to be sure my marriage was over and that I was truly free,' he said. 'You’ve already seen that when it comes to romance, I had a gift for complicating things. But marrying Annie wasn’t complicated at all.

It’s about the smartest thing I ever did ... thirty-four years after we first met, we’re still together and going strong.'

Nelson, who co-wrote with book with his sister and bandmate Bobbie, who has been married four times, is father to seven kids. 

Nelson’s past marriages were to Martha Matthews from 1952 until 1962; Collie from 1963 thru 1971; and Connie Koepke from 1971 until 1988. He and D’Angelo exchanged vows in 1991 in Nashville.
