Shia LaBeouf put his free time to good use on Sunday by venturing out for a jog near his southern California home. 

Dressed appropriately in a grey T-shirt and gym leggings, the actor, 34, looked focused as he jogged the sidewalks in suburban Pasadena.

He added to his look with a pair of black running shoes, while a blue New York Yankees baseball cap rounded things off.

Shia was ending his day with a bracing run after taking part in a table read for 1982 film Fast Times At Ridgemont High, organised on behalf of the CORE [Community Organised Relief Effort] coronavirus charity. 

The event, officially titled Dane Cook Presents Feelin' A-Live Fast Times At Ridgemont High, served as a fundraiser for the humanitarian organisation, co-founded by actor Sean Penn and REFORM Alliance in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic. 

Shia took on Penn's role as high school stoner and surfer Jeff Spicoli in the original movie, while Penn himself played a pizza delivery guy wearing a face mask who delivers food to Jeff in Mr. Hand's classroom, with the teacher played by Ray Liotta.

Other stars to take part included Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, John Legend, Matthew McConaughey and Jimmy Kimmel. 

Meanwhile, Labeouf and his Tax Collector director David Ayers recently found themselves in the line of fire after being accused of 'Cholo' cultural appropriation. 

After a series of Twitter attacks, the director replied: 'Really important answer - Shia is playing a whiteboy who grew up in the hood.

'This is a Jewish dude playing a white character. Also the only white dude in the movie.'

Ayer's latest film tells the story of a crime lord's 'tax collector' is Los Angeles and how his life is upended when a rival boss arrives to town.

The cast is almost exclusively Latinx POC except for Shia, who donned a dark-trimmed goatee and hair, and a 'barrio accent.'
