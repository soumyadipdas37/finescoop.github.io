Britons made the most of the final evening of the three-day weekend yesterday with nights out across the country. 

Young men and women went out for a night on the tiles on the final August weekend, with some even sporting patterned face masks.

Many of Britain's young people were enjoying time off through social outings with their friends - with a handful of those no doubt facing sore heads as they start work this morning.
