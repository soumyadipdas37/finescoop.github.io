She is on one of her first family summer holidays since having a baby son with husband Dom Lever in October last year. 

And Jess Shears looked incredible in a series of sexy bikini snaps which she shared to social media during her travels.

The 2017 Love Island contestant, 27, looked sensational as she displayed her curves in a skimpy snakeskin bikini that left little to the imagination.

Wow: Jess looked body confident and showed off her golden glow in her tiny two-piece 

Clutching a morning coffee as she sat with a grey cardigan draped around her back, the former glamour model displayed glimpses of the numerous tattoos on her hand and waist.   

Jess captioned the post, 'Bikini from @Meshki a couple years ago', as she sat on a shaded wicker sofa to escape the fierce Greek sun. 

Thursday's snap is just the latest that Jess has posted to give fans a glimpse of her getaway.

It has been a happy escape for the family, with Jess telling fans back in July that she could not wait to go on holiday and try on her collection of bikinis.

Dom also took to Instagram to share some loved-up snaps with his wife on their holiday.

In one sweet post, he shared his wife's lingerie snap and added the caption: 'Oh my word,' followed by a heart and drool emoji.

Jess met Dom on Love Island in 2017. They announced their engagement after three months of dating and married in a romantic ceremony in the Greek Island of Mykonos in October 2018.

Jess and Dom welcomed their baby son in October 2019, although they kept the sex a secret for months. 

The couple still haven't revealed their son's name, though they have posted several glimpses of him on social media.
