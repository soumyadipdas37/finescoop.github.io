Singletons in China are being hung out to dry by their matchmaking parents, who are advertising details about them on a washing-line in a bid to marry them off.

The bizarre dating ritual takes place at People's Park in Shanghai, where parents peg out information about their grown-up sons and daughters in the hope of finding them an eligible life partner.

The adverts include details such as their child's age, height, educational background, profession and income.

Good on paper: Parents in Shanghai are drawing up laminated adverts to promote their sons and daughters to potential partners

 

Young wives' tales: Parents seeking the daughter-in-law of their dreams will find a selection of potential spouses on display

 

With some of the adverts attached to small packages, it seems some parents find it hard to keep their child's qualities to just one sheet of A4

The typical requirement of a prospective groom is that he be a 'responsible man with stable income' or someone 'who owns an apartment and a car'.

Women, meanwhile, are required to be 'kind, have a stable job and preferably hold a bachelor's degree'.

The keen parents then scan the dating adverts and chat to other parents in an attempt to match their son or daughter with a potential spouse. 

Something for the weekend? The matchmaking parents gather on Saturdays and Sundays to survey the city's singletons

 

High expectations: The advertisers generally want wives who are 'kind, have a stable job and preferably hold a bachelor's degree'

 

When it comes to husbands, the ideal candidate is a 'responsible man with stable income' or someone 'who owns an apartment and a car'

 

Narrowing the options: Keen mothers and fathers reckon they can help their child find a life partner by chatting to like-minded parents

 

Vital statistics: The adverts include thoughtful details such as the son or daughter's height, job...and salary

One parent, Ma Jianhua, 55, who was attempting to find his son a wife, told China Daily: 'I first came here six months ago after reading about the park's matchmaking activities in the newspaper.

'Since then I have been coming here almost every weekend. On days that I can't make it, my wife steps in for me.

'My son is too busy to date girls, so I am here on his behalf.

'Although my son and I have different tastes, I can at least narrow down some of the girls who meet his requirements, by speaking to the girl's parents. After all, a woman's manner and character are often influenced by their parents.'

Love letters: The parents don't have much to go on, but as one father put it, 'it's a good platform'

 

Well, it's cheaper than a personal ad: The park's green spaces provide an healthy environment for partner-hunting

Ma said his 28-year-old son was looking for a caring girl aged between 24 and 26, with a bachelor's degree.

He hasn't had any luck so far, as while he has introduced his son to several girls, none have made the cut.

He said: 'I will not give up, as a father, I will not feel comfortable if I don't do something for my son.

'I know very well that there are all kinds of people here, but it's a good platform. Nowhere else in the city can you find so many candidates.

'Besides, I believe matchmaking works. Some of the parents I used to see are no longer here. I think they must have found someone.'

Stiff competition: The number of singletons may be high, but for these parents, that's an advantage
