Donald Trump's demoted campaign boss Brad Parscale is under investigation for 'stealing' between $25-$40 million from Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, well-placed sources exclusively told DailyMail.com.

The 44-year-old is also being investigated for 'pocketing' nearly another $10 million from the Republican National Committee, the insiders added.   

The revelation comes as Parscale was involuntarily committed to a hospital by Fort Lauderdale police on Sunday following a concerning episode at his $2.4 million Florida home. 

DailyMail.com revealed on Monday that his wife Candice Parscale was seen screaming and fleeing the home in just her bikini, telling a passerby: 'I think my husband just killed himself'. 

As many as 20 police cars and boats swarmed the waterfront property after the distraught wife told cops she heard a revolver being cocked and a 'loud boom' after Parscale began 'ranting and raving'.

Candice told police that Parscale had been 'stressed out for the past two weeks and has made suicidal comments throughout the week to shoot himself', according to an officer's report.  

A Trump insider explained to DailyMail.com that Parscale went into a tailspin after he was demoted in July and replaced by his former number two, Bill Stepien, as he's worried about the 'gravy train' ending and keeping up with his lavish lifestyle.

Steve Guest, the RNC Rapid Response Director, said in a statement to DailyMail.com: 'This report is categorically false. There is no audit or investigation of Brad at the RNC.'  

It was widely reported that the President lost faith in Parscale after a much-trumpeted campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma drew a dismal crowd, relegating him to his previous role in digital and data strategy.

The well-placed source said just days later, Trump ordered an audit of the spending of the Republican National Committee.

The probe appeared to be geared towards examining Parscale's handling of the campaign's money, the source said, putting the 6ft 8in aide under 'tremendous pressure'. 

The source explained: 'The thing about what Parscale did with the finances of the campaign could actually be totally legal. 

'But Brad has tons of bills since his lifestyle picked up, and he sees the gravy train coming to an end.'    

Parscale seemed to try to put it out of his mind, as DailyMail.com published exclusive images of Parscale, his wife and several friends drinking beer and liquor by their pool days after his demotion.

Our source said such scenes were becoming routine for Parscale who was spotted stumbling out of bars in Fort Lauderdale, where he and his wife own three swish condos worth a combined $5 million.

The couple have at least $300,000 worth of cars - including a 2017 Ferrari, a Range Rover and a BMW X6 - while public records suggest Parscale has owned as many as eight boats. 

Their spending spree represents a remarkable turnaround for the college basketball standout who lost his family's company to bankruptcy in the mid-2000s but rebuilt his finances after working for Trump in various digital guises since 2011.

Campaign records show Parscale was making $15,000 a month as Trump's electioneering guru.

Parscale had overseen the disastrous rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma (pictured), which started with a claim a million wanted to attend. But despite his bragging, the turn-out was much lower than expected

Last year, Parscale told DailyMail.com he would not apologize for becoming wealthy, saying: 'I make no secret about the fact that working for the Trump family made me a wealthy man well before I ever became President Trump's campaign manager.

'The President is an excellent businessman and being associated with him for years has been extremely beneficial to my family.' 

On Sunday, his wife Candice fled from the front yard to the passerby, getting into her car. The woman then called 911 with Candice at her side.  

Believing he was dead, she buried her head in the stranger's lap and sobbed uncontrollably until officers revealed Parscale was still alive and asked for his cell number so they could begin negotiations.

Police dispatch records reveal marksmen could see into the $2.4 million property where Parscale was sat shirtless on the floor with his dog, drinking beer and 'talking to himself'.

The witness, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, told DailyMail.com she also noticed evidence of bruising on Candice's upper arms.

Campaign records show Parscale was making $15,000 a month as Trump's electioneering guru. In January 2019, the day of his 43rd birthday, Parscale bought this $2.4 million canal-front mansion in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Broward County real estate records show

Parscale and his wife have at least $300,000 worth of cars - including a 2017 Ferrari, a Range Rover, a BMW X6 and $146,000 Range Rover while public records suggest Parscale has owned as many as eight boats

Further reports and police body cam footage made public on Monday confirmed Candice had revealed injuries to officers and told them she suffered them in an 'altercation' with her husband of four years, adding that he hits her.  

The chaotic scene ended without tragedy about an hour and a half later when Parscale was dramatically tackled by a SWAT officer after he ignored five demands to 'get on the ground'. 

A police report obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals that Parscale had ten weapons inside the home, including two rifles, two shotguns, five handguns and a small revolver. 

The witness, who just happened to be passing by the swank home, said: 'I was on the phone to a friend when I noticed this woman coming towards me with virtually nothing on, just her bathing suit

As many as 20 police cars and boats swarmed the waterfront property after the distraught wife told cops she heard a revolver being cocked and a 'loud boom' after her 44-year-old husband began 'ranting and raving'. The chaotic scene ended without tragedy about an hour and a half later when Parscale was dramatically tackled by a SWAT officer 

'She knocked on the window and says, I think my husband just killed himself. I said, ''Oh my God. Oh my God, come get in my car'' and I hung up on my friend and dialed 911.

'She was hysterical, she was hyperventilating, she nearly collapsed but I caught her and pulled her into the vehicle. 

'She had her head in my lap and she was just sobbing. I was just trying to keep her calm.

'When she was in the car and we were on hold, I saw both her arms had bruises. She is just a tiny thing. She seemed so sweet and distraught.'

As the two women huddled in the vehicle, cops surrounded the property, stationing marksmen with shields in front of the driveway while approaching from the rear on boats.

A video obtained by DailyMail.com reveals Candice, by now wrapped in a white towel, peering over a line of police cars as officers call up her husband's cell and negotiate his surrender.

'The police presence was huge, they were being extra protective in case he started shooting. Once he answered the phone they knew he was alive,' the Good Samaritan said.

A police report obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals that Parscale had ten weapons inside the home, including two rifles, two shotguns, five handguns and a small revolver.

As many as 20 police cars and boats swarmed the waterfront property after the distraught wife told cops she heard a revolver being cocked and a 'loud boom' after her 44-year-old husband began 'ranting and raving'

'I didn't see him come out of the house because they made everyone stand so far back. But it was over quickly, maybe an hour and a half to two hours. The police were very calm, very professional.

'The wife was sat on a gurney for a while and she seemed to calm down. 

'There had clearly been some stress for a while and she just seemed relieved it was over. Her husband has got a lot going on, he's a mess.' 

Police dispatch notes from Sunday's incident reveal police were alerted at 3:56pm when Candice told the passerby there had been a 'suicide attempt' inside their home.

'Male was ranting and raving about something. Heard gun cock and then a gunshot,' the notes read. 'Male was looking out the front window, walked away from the window and heard a loud boom.'

The report says the male was wearing just a white robe and carrying a revolver.

It says neither the caller, nor the wife could confirm whether or not Parscale had shot himself because Candice was 'too scared to go inside'.

'There are multiple firearms in residence. Husband is barricading himself inside,' the dispatch adds. 'Keeps hanging up on unites.'

Officers were able to 'get a visual' of Parscale, shirtless, wearing a black hat and 'sitting on the floor talking to himself'.

They could not see what he had in his hands but were able to report that he was sat with his dog, arguing with someone over the phone and was periodically peering through the blinds.

The witness added: 'The wife was sat on a gurney for a while and she seemed to calm down. There had clearly been some stress for a while and she just seemed relieved it was over. Her husband has got a lot going on, he's a mess'

The dispatch reports that Parscale walked out of his house to talk directly to negotiators before wandering back inside for a beer.

When he came back outside and sat on his stoop 'talking to himself' an order was issued to 'move in to grab him now'.

Moments after the order was issued Parscale ignored five demands to 'get on the ground' - but was dramatically tackled by a SWAT officer.

'Due to the subject disobeying my lawful commands coupled with the subject being substantially larger than I am, Subject approx 6`6' and wearing shorts with pockets that could easily conceal a firearm, I initiated a double leg takedown,' wrote Sgt. M. Moceri.

Further Reports made public Monday confirmed that Candice had revealed injuries to officers and told them she suffered them in an 'altercation' with her husband of four years.

'While speaking with Candace Parscale (sic) I noticed several large sized contusions on both of her arms, her cheek and forehead,' wrote Officer S. Smith.

'When I asked how she received the bruising, Candace Parscale stated Brad Parscale hits her. When asked if he made these markings today, she claimed he did not.

'I continued to ask if Brad Parscale physically assaulted her in any way today and she said no, but he did forcibly smack her phone out of her hand when she was attempting to call Brad Parscale`s father.'

Another officer, T. Skaggs, wrote in his report Sunday: 'I made contact with Candace (sic), who stated that Bradley has been stressed out for the past two weeks and has made suicidal comments throughout the week to shoot himself.

'Bradley did not make any suicidal comments today however Candace was concerned for his safety. Candace advised Bradley drinks and he 'suffers from PTSD'.

'While speaking with Candace I observed several bruises on both which she advised occurred a few days ago, during a physical altercation with Bradley, which she did not report.'

A police report obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals that Parscale had ten weapons inside the home (pictured), including two rifles, two shotguns, five hand guns and a small revolver 

Candice told Officer Skaggs that Sunday's incident was sparked by a 'verbal altercation' after which Bradley loaded a firearm in front of her.

'Candace immediately fled residence and stated she heard a loud bang shortly after. Candace stated that they realized that Bradley did not shoot himself when they heard Bradley ranting and pacing around the residence and the dog barking franticly.

'However, they were concerned that Bradley might still try to shoot himself, due to him being in possession of several firearms and refusing to vacate the residence.'

The officer said he made contact with Parscale on a landline but he refused to come out.

The turning point came when a friend who happened to also be on the police department came to the house and helped to talk him down.

'Bradley`s speech was slurred as though he was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and he seemed to be crying,' Skaggs went on.

'I continued to make landline with Bradley, who advised several times that he would not exit the residence without speaking to his wife Candace.

'With the assistance of Ofc. C. Wilson, Bradley was convinced to exit the residence and was placed into custody by FLPD SWAT personnel.'

Cops seized the ten firearms and also took photos of injuries on Parscale's body that had happened several days earlier, according to the report.

The Trump aide said he was not on medication and wasn't suffering from any medical illnesses but cops decided to detain him under Florida's Baker Act.

He can be held involuntarily for up to 72 hours while he is medically assessed.

There was no sign today of Candice at the couple's house, which is being guarded by three security officers.
