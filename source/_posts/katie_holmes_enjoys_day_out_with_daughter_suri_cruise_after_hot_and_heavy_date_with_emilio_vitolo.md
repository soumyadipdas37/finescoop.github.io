The 5ft9 actress wore a pink face mask with black sunglasses and had her locks pulled back.

Suri donned a long-sleeved white top over tank top with black pants and white sneakers. She had her brown locks down and parted on the daytime outing. 

Suri had her cloth mask pulled down to her chin as she worked on a small portion of frozen yogurt, with a pink backpack hanging from her shoulder.

Holmes was seen kissing the 33-year-old chef Vitolo on Sunday evening during a night out in Manhattan as they were spotted going out to dinner at the Peasant Restaurant.
