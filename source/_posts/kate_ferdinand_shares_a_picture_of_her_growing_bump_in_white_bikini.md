Kate Ferdinand showed off her growing baby bump while on one last holiday before school starts again. 

The former TOWIE star, 29, who is married to footballer Rio Ferdinand, 41, looked incredible in a skimpy white bikini which showed off her incredible shape. 

She sat on a comfortable looking sofa while looking out to sea at an unknown location, shielding her face with a chic sun visor.

Snap happy: Rio also shared this picture and wrote: 'Selfie mug #instamood #andwhat'

Kate, who is stepmother to Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia, wrote: 'One last trip before school starts ... the baby seems to like a holiday.'

The latest trip comes after Kate and Rio Ferdinand reportedly splashed out £40,000 on a pair of highly-trained dogs to protect their home.

The celebrity couple are said to want extra security at their mansion for their growing family.

Happy news: It's Kate's first child with husband Rio but she is stepmother to his children Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia

They reportedly enlisted the help of a special protection dog company, Chaperone K9, to buy the pair of black German shepherds.

A source told The Sun: 'One is already at their home, and the second will be joining shortly. 

'The couple already have a dog - Kate's chihuahua - but Rio will enjoy walking these pair a lot more!

'They are incredible family dogs and will protect them like nothing else - everyone has one these days and who can blame them after everything that's happened with the other footballers. Rio is taking no chances!'

It comes after a number of high-profile burglaries at footballers' homes, with Dele Alli and Fabinho among those targeted recently.

Chaperone K9 shared a snap of the new protection dogs on their Instagram, tagging Kate and Rio in the post before they edited it.

They also previously posted a photo of Rio posing with one of the dogs's alongside Kate's chihuahua
