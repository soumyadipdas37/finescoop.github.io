Liverpool are reportedly in regular contact with Kylian Mbappe over a summer move in 2021 - but the Reds face competition from Real Madrid.

Mbappe has two years left on his Paris Saint-Germain contract and there is no indication he will sign a new deal with the French champions any time soon. 

According to French outlet L'Equipe, Jurgen Klopp's side are keeping an eye on the forward's situation with Real also hoping to lure him away from the Ligue 1 side.
