A father who killed his son and then himself in a shocking murder-suicide posted on Facebook about his battles with mental health issues just weeks before the tragedy.

Troy Harvey, 45, and his son Koah, four, were found dead at a property at Rossville, north of Cairns in far north Queensland, on Friday morning.

Police initially attended the home after receiving a call from a 36-year-old woman a night earlier, who claimed she had been assaulted by Mr Harvey.

When officers arrived they made the grim discovery.

Tributes have flowed for the youngster in the days since his death, while Mr Harvey's social media posts are expected to form part of a coronial inquiry.

In early July, less than a month before the tragedy, Mr Harvey - a boxercise teacher - posted about how he had suffered through 'a full on nervous mental breakdown'.

'I had a full on nervous mental breakdown whatever you want to call it,' he wrote. 

'I am so sorry to all the people I have hurt or let down over the years due to excessive drug and alcohol abuse.

'I am seeking help,so come on down get fit. Let's support those with mental health issues, past traumas, or any thing else that's seems to pull us down and feel like know where to run to.'  

Police are appealing for public assistance in their investigations and want to speak to anyone who had contact with Mr Harvey between August 28 and September 4.

They also want to speak to the driver of a silver vehicle who visited Mr Harvey's home on Friday morning Queensland detective inspector Jason Smith said.

Koah's mother Natsuko Kurihara posted a heartbreaking dedication to her son where she begged him to forgive her, saying 'I'm so sorry I couldn't save you'. 

'My beautiful boy Koah, he has had only four years of life, this has been taken by his father. He then took his own life,' Ms Kurihara posted on Saturday.

'I'm in pain life is not fair.

'Let the people you love know you love them as they can be taken from you.

Detective Acting Inspector Jason Smith told The Cairns Post 'they worked on him for a significant period of time.'

He is one of a number of detectives who are specialist officers who are travelling to the remote town on the Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland about 30km north of Cooktown, on Saturday.

A crime scene has been established and detectives have launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Harvey, 46, and the boy. 

'We're treating it seriously and looking at all possibilities. We'll have a total of eight detectives and we're seeking to speak to anyone who had any information about the family,' Dect Insp Smith said.

It is understood Ms Kurihara was not at home when officers arrived on scene.

Ms Kurihara said there are 'no words to describe how I feel. Sad and regrets,' she posted to Facebook. 

Cook Shire Mayor Peter Scott described the incident as 'terrible' and offered his commiserations to the family and friends.

Pictures posted online appear to show the suspected killer as a loving, doting father. 

The town of Rossville has a population of just over 200 people.

Lion's Den Hotel pub owner, Darryl Paradise, said it's the kind of close-knit community where 'everyone knows everyone'. 

A keen fisherman, Mr Harvey (pictured) is understood to have posted a message to a local Facebook group apologising to people he had 'hurt or let down'

'We don't expect to see this sort of thing happening in the neighbourhood,' he told the ABC.

'We heard about it at lunch time today — we're all totally shocked and just find it hard to believe.

'It is a very small community, everybody knows everybody and everybody speaks to everybody.'
