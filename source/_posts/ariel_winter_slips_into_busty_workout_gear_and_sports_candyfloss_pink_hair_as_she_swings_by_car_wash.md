Ariel Winter was glimpsed looking California casual as she swung by a car wash this Friday in Los Angeles.

The 22-year-old slipped into some busty skintight black workout gear for her latest outing, slinging on a sleek white handbag.

She sported candyfloss pink hair and made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown.

The Modern Family alumna revealed on her Insta Stories recently that she is auctioning off a Zoom chat with herself in aid of rescued dogs.

Name-checking her own pooches she wrote: 'Join me and Casper, Chloe, Cash & Cleo in supporting our rescue pups by participating in the @wagsandwalks auction! Help them raise critical funds for dogs in need by bidding on a virtual meet and greet with me now through September 10th!'

The Mr. Peabody And Sherman actress concluded her message: 'Visit CharityBuzz.com and search "Wags and Walks" under charities!'

Amid the coronavirus lockdowns Ariel has been hunkering down with her dashing 25-year-old boyfriend Luke Benward.

Early this May Ariel revealed that she accidentally sliced off the tip of her left thumb while making Greek food.

She dished that when she was in the hospital she was handed a bag without being told her thumb tip was inside.

As a result she tossed the bag into the garbage and was forced to go back and retrieve it, the Modern Family star dished on Access.

Before she took up with her current smoldering hunk Ariel spent years dating little-known actor Levi Meaden, 32.

She told Refinery29 in 2017 of her romance with Levi, with its dramatic age gap: 'I'm happy, and whatever people want to say, they can say.'

Ariel, whose figure had drawn its share of online trolling, said: 'He's always complimenting me and making me feel special and beautiful.'
