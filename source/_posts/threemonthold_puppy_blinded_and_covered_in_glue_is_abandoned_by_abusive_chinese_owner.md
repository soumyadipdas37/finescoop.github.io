A three-month-old puppy has been found covered in glue after the owner dumped it in a plastic bag on a rural street in China.

Heart-breaking pictures show the poor animal’s entire body layered with a white mixture of gypsum powder and adhesive building materials when it was rescued on Tuesday.

Vets found the dog’s eyes were burned and blinded by the glue. It also suffered multiple bone fractures with a broken tail, believed to be injuries from being savagely beaten by its previous owner.

One commenter wrote: ‘I’ve never seen such abusive behaviours! These people should go to hell.’
