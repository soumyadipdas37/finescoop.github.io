Congratulations are in order for actor Penn Badgley and musician Domino Kirke.

The couple confirmed the arrival of their first child together on Sunday after suffering through two miscarriages.

Kirke, 36, took to Instagram and shared an adorable picture of herself laying beside her newborn baby, who can be seen delicately wrapped up in a soft white blanket.

In the sweet snap, the DOMINO singer is also wrapped in a white blanket as she laid on her back with arms above her head, making some of her arm tattoos visible.

The baby, who's gender hasn't been revealed, looked to be sleeping as mom appeared to be staring at her new arrival with an enduring look of love on her face.

From the sounds and looks of a second Instagram post on Sunday, it appears the sister of Girls star Jemima Kirke and Mozart in the Jungle actress Lola Kirke gave birth more than a month ago. 

Kirke shared a painting of a red uterus with the caption, 'His heart shaped home, #40dayspostpartum,' which seems to signify that she and the Gossip Girl star welcomed their child 40 days ago.

There is some major significance to Kirke sharing about her being 40 days postpartum.

In most customs and religions, the first 40 days after delivery of a child, termed as the confinement period, are strictly meant for the mother to rest, recuperate and bond with the baby. Practices and rituals followed during this period are different across various parts of the country.    

The First 40 Days also marks around the six week mark, where the new mother has usually stopped bleeding, and breastfeeding has been established as long as she is well rested, nourished, reasonably complication free and starting to regain her energy.

Hint: The singer also shared a painting of a red uterus while confessing she reached 40 days postpartum in the caption

While this is the first child for the couple, Kirke also has a 10-year-old son, Cassius, that she shares with her ex-partner and musician Morgan O'Kane.   

Kirke announced the news of her latest pregnancy in an Instagram post on February 10 that included a photo of her growing baby bump and an emotional message about significance of her pending bundle of joy.

'On the road again... pregnancy after loss is a whole other thing. After two miscarriages in a row we were ready to call it. I stopped trusting my body and started to accept the fact that I was done. As a birth attendant, I've seen and heard it all. It takes everything I’ve got to detach lovingly from the losses I've been present for and be in my own experience,' she confessed with obvious heartfelt emotion.

The singer went on to write, 'When I was pregnant at 25, I knew nothing. I had no community. I dove in blissfully unaware about birth and its mysteries. Now, with 10 years worth of experience to pull from, I treasure my birth community and the knowledge I have. You're already teaching us how to stay in the day in a way we’ve never had to, little one. Thank you.'

Kirke and Badgley started dating back in 2014, and were eventually married in a New York courthouse in February 2017.     

Back in December, the star of the Netflix psychological thriller series You gushed over his wife on her 36th birthday by calling her 'a truly radiant soul' who seems 'to spark alight almost everyone you meet' 

'You make others happy by you. For me, it is a joy to witness you when you are happy,' he wrote, in part, in the Instagram post.

'For you, I always hope to be a source of joy. I'm really glad we're married.'
