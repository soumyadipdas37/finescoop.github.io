Fulham have signed Southampton outcast Mario Lemina on a season-long loan deal.

The 26-year-old midfielder spent the bulk of last term on loan at Galatasaray, but will now return to Premier League action with promoted Fulham.

The deal contains an option for a permanent move for the Gabon international at the end of the loan agreement.

Director of football operations Tony Khan revealed Fulham's management team have tracked Lemina for some time.

'Mario Lemina has top-flight experience throughout Europe, including in the Premier League, and I'm very excited to announce his arrival on loan,' said Khan.

'I chose to pursue Mario this summer because in our recruitment conferences he's been highly rated by our scouting team and our head coach Scott Parker, and our statistical research team.

'I believe he will thrive for our club under Scott's coaching and leadership.'

Lemina joined Southampton from Juventus in an Â£18million deal in 2017, but his last Saints appearance was back in May 2019.

The former France Under-21 star is relishing the chance to work with boss Parker at Fulham.

'Now I'm with Fulham, I'm really happy and I'm glad to be part of the project,' said Lemina.

'I spoke with the manager and he's got some good ideas about the team, about the project, about everything he wants to do this season, and I'm happy to be a part of it.'
