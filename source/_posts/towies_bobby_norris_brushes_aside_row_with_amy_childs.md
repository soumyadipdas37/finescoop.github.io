The reality star, 34, who used to date Amy's cousin Harry Derbidge, said that he has no ill-feeling and they both made 'b*tchy comments' when Harry cheated on Bobby with his ex-boyfriend during their romance.

Cheers to moving on: Bobby Norris has revealed their is no bad blood between himself and Amy Childs after they addressed their six-year feud in a recent episode of TOWIE

Discussing their fall out, Bobby was keen to acknowledge that 'feud is quite a strong word' but that 'we didn't remain BFFs'. 

Speaking to Fubar host Stephen Leng about their dispute, Bobby said: 'There's kind of no ill feeling my side. It's great to have her back on the show.

He continued: 'I'm one of them people babe, I don't harbour grudges with anyone and it was never really our problem. I would never hold it against her what happened between me and her cousin and vice versa.'

No feuds here! The reality star, 34, who used to date Amy's cousin Harry Derbidge, said that he has no ill-feeling and they both made 'b*tchy comments' when Harry cheated on Bobby with his ex-boyfriend during their romance

Bobby has clearly grown up a lot since the fall out and admits that it shouldn't be dwelled upon any more: 

'Everyone's moved on and like years have passed and we're in a global pandemic, do you know what I mean, so we can't be worrying about something from six years ago. 

'There's enough going on in the world, there's enough going on in Essex to worry about, let alone something from back in the day.'

During a 2014 The Only Way Is Marbs episode, Harry admitted to cheating on Bobby with his ex, and following the relevation Bobby had some cross-words with Amy.

In a recent interview with The Sun, Amy discussed what went down between her and the reality star: 'Bobby said some bitchy things and I said some bitchy things and it was just one of those fallouts where we didn't really speak after that.

'It was such a long time ago but I knew it was still going to be awkward between us because I was coming back to the show.' 

Friends again? Discussing their fall out, Bobby was keen to acknowledge that 'feud is quite a strong word' but that 'we didn't remain BFFs'
