England's best places to stay, its most mouthwatering eateries and its most enthralling visitor attractions have been named in the 2020 VisitEngland Awards for Excellence.

The winners were selected from hundreds of tourism businesses across England including hotels, self-catering accommodation, B&Bs, glamping operators, attractions, restaurants, pubs, museums and conference centres - and 19 winners were announced during a virtual awards event on Monday evening hosted by Julia Bradbury from 'The Outdoor Guide'.

One of the most eagerly anticipated categories is always Pub of the Year - and this year the gold medal went to The Baskerville in Oxfordshire, with the Three Horseshoes Pub & Kitchen in Dorset snaring silver and The Howard Arms in Warwickshire taking third place.

Tourism minister Nigel Huddleston said: 'Not only does our tourism industry offer incredible experiences to those who holiday here, it supports millions of jobs up and down the country. I'm delighted to see so many great establishments, from major Lincolnshire attractions to boutique Yorkshire hotels, being celebrated.

'This important sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus and we have helped with an unprecedented package of measures including the job retention scheme, a year's business rates holiday and most recently a £4billion reduction in VAT benefitting the sector.

'I would like to congratulate all the winners and businesses around England who are doing an outstanding job in showcasing the best in tourism. I encourage everyone to get out, enjoy summer safely, and experience everything England has to offer.'

VisitEngland Chief Executive Sally Balcombe added: 'These prestigious awards celebrate the outstanding businesses and individuals in tourism across England who have delivered excellence. From a world-class boutique B&B in Devon to adventure-packed experiences in Somerset, from an accessible country park and national nature reserve in Dorset to a bespoke English wine tour in Kent, our award winners provide stand-out experiences of the highest calibre.

'Millions of jobs and local economies depend on tourism and this year's awards are also a timely reminder of the determination, innovation and commitment of businesses across the country who have been working extremely hard to reopen, to welcome visitors back safely and to continue to provide a first-class experience.'
