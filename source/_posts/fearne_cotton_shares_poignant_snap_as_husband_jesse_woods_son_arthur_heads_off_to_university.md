Fearne Cotton and her husband Jesse Wood celebrated a milestone on Saturday as his son Arthur headed off to university. 

The television presenter, 39, took to Instagram to share a hilarious recreation snap from his childhood of the pair putting their arms around one another to show his 'rapid growth spurt'. 

With Arthur now towering over Fearne, she joked it was her 'destiny to become the shortest member of the family over the next decade'.

'Swipe to see the most rapid growth spurt known to man. My destiny being to end up as the shortest member of our family within the next decade. 

'Good luck Arthur my lovely step son! You've got this!'

Off he goes! Meanwhile, Jesse, 43, also uploaded a photo from Arthur's childhood alongside one of the pair in the back of the car on the way to university

Back in July, the presenter spoke candidly about the challenges her marriage with husband Jesse has faced during the COVID-19 crisis and confessed they've had several 'fiery' rows in front of their two children.

Fearne said that with her family holed up at home in lockdown she's also argued with her son Rex, seven, and daughter Honey, four, but insisted their family is stronger than ever. 

Jesse also has Arthur and daughter Lola, 15, from his previous marriage to Tilly Wood.  

Speaking on her Happy Place podcast according to The Sun, Fearne admitted she and Jesse had several rows in front of their children during lockdown. 

She said: 'I've also shouted at my kids like I think most parents have, especially during lockdown.

'We have no school, full-time work for me, no help here ­whatsoever — like most families, you're just stuck within four walls trying to survive.' 

Fearne added: 'It has been mad. We've all had a shout at each other, the kids have shouted at me, we've shouted at them. But I constantly endeavour to go, ''Fearne, don't act like a child, get yourself together''.'

In previous years Fearne has been incredibly open about some of the more difficult patches in her six-year marriage to Jesse, and last year admitted that they were left 'clinging' onto their relationship after a 'two hour screaming match.'   

Challenge: Fearne has previously confessed that it is tough juggling her career with parenthood (pictured with their two children Rex, seven, and Honey, four)
