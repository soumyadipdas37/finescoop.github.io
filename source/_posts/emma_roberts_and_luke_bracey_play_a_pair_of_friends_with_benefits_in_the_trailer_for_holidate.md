Emma Roberts' fans were treated to a glimpse of her latest role in the upcoming romantic comedy Holidate with the release of its trailer on Tuesday.

The 29-year-old actress stars opposite Luke Bracey, 31, in the film, which will hit Netflix on October 28.

The two star as acquaintances who hatch up a plan to be each others platonic dates for every holiday.

Emma is featured in the trailer's opening moments and stars as Sloane, who's clearly focused on her work, at least until her mother (Frances Fisher) interrupts for a video chat.

She tactlessly tries to introduce her daughter to a doctor in hopes of setting her up ahead of their Christmas celebrations.

But soon she meets Jackson (Bracey) who hates the holidays as much as she does.

The two hate being pestered about being single by their families and being shunted off to the kids' table.

After they both have awkward holidays with their families, they make a pact to be each other's holidate, a platonic date for each holiday so they'll never have to worry about being single in front of family.

The trailer shows Sloane getting the idea from her wild aunt (played by Kristen Chenoweth) who gets disposable boy toys for the holidays.

She's initially uncertain that it can work between the two, but Jackson promises they'll keep it non-sexual to avoid complications.

The trailer features a wild montage of the faux couple partying while celebrating various holidays, though it doesn't go well for Jackson, who blows his finger off while playing with fireworks at a lakeside barbecue.

But his injury seems to bring him and Sloane closer together after she gets affectionate with him.

But neither is willing to express their feelings for fear of violating their original pact or being embarrassed if the other person doesn't share their feelings.

The trailer ends on a hilarious note, as Sloane and Jackson try to recreate the iconic lift from Dirty Dancing at an alcohol-fueled New Year's Eve party.

There have already been some mishaps, as her white dress is stained with either red wine or blood.

But after Jackson catches her, the top of her dress rips, exposing her to everyone in the club and causing her to topple down.

'Nobody drops baby on her head,' she says later as the two nurse ice packs.

Roberts marked the occasion of the trailer dropping by sharing the movie's poster to her Instagram account.

'Get ready you guys!! You’re gonna love this one #Holidate,' she wrote. 

'You’ve never heard of a Holidate? It’s the perfect plus-one! That non-romantic friend who escorts you to an otherwise awkward holiday event when you don’t have a significant other. Watch us all try to try to find romance this Holiday season in the hilarious HOLIDATE on October 28th only on Netflix.'

The new trailer comes almost a month after the American Horror Story actress revealed she was pregnant and expecting a boy with her partner Garrett Hedlund.
