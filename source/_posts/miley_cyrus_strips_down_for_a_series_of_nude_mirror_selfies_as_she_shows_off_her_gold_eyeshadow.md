She recently blasted an MTV VMAs director for sexist comments on her performance. 

But Miley Cyrus got to be her own director on Wednesday night as she took nude mirror selfies that she posted to Instagram. 

The 27-year-old singer photographed herself leaning in towards the mirror putting her gold and glittering eyeshadow on display.

The Wrecking Ball singer seemed to not have on an inch of clothing as she perfectly posed and used her arms and phone to cover any private parts. 

She posed in front of a blue piece of art as she snapped the pictures she captioned 'bisous,' which is French for 'kiss.' 

Miley left her blonde mullet haircut in a spikey and messy look, and with a red band lifting a back portion straight into the air. 

She seemed to have her makeup fully done for the stripped down snaps as her eyes were covered in gold and she had a bright red pout.

Leaning onto the counter, she rested on her forearms, with tattoos on her torso in short and her legs seemed bare though her pose hid areas perfectly.  

Earlier this month, Miley spoke out about a sexist experience she endured with one of the directors of her performance at the recent MTV Video Music Awards.

The Midnight Sky singer made the claim during her chat with Joe Rogan on his Joe Rogan Experience podcast, detailing the incident. 

She began explaining how she'd requested for the lights to be turned off during her performance - including a 'beauty light' used specifically for female performers - which ruffled some feathers with a director.

Technical difficulties: Earlier this month, Miley spoke out about a sexist experience she endured with one of the directors of her performance at the recent MTV Video Music Awards 

'I was just asking some questions, not even on some diva s****,' she said, saying: 'I wanted the lights to be turned off and then the lighting of the room to just be lighting me. So no key light, no beauty light.'

'The beauty light is always used on women and I said turn the f******g lights off. You would never tell Travis Scott or Adam Levine that he couldn't turn the beauty light off.'

The pop star continued: 'They said, "Okay, we'll just do the same thing that we would do with the guys," because that's what I want.'

Beauty: Miley - who shared these stunning snaps on Thursday - made the comments while appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast

'And then something that I was doing... for the VMAs, my bracelets kept getting caught in all this s***t and they said, '"you want to be treated like a guy? We wouldn't be dealing with this if a guy was doing it."' 

'And I said, "Well a guy wouldn't be doing this because a guy doesn't sell your show with sex the way that I'm going to,"' she divulged. 'And I'm aware of that. It's a ridiculous conversation and also embarrassing.'

Miley's performance saw her stride across a giant disco ball on stage as she held onto a chain in a skimpy pair of pants.
