They became parents for the first time when they welcomed baby son Sonny last month.

And Coronation Street star Sam Aston's wife Briony introduced their newborn to the world of yoga early on as she performed a pose with him strapped to her chest in a heart-warming social media post on Thursday.

The yoga instructor, 25, wore maroon linen drawstring trousers and a khaki vest as she nailed the Utkata Konasana pose.

Sonny rested peacefully on her chest in a white polka-dot wrap and is already rocking a full head of ginger hair, just like his father, 27. 

Two weeks after giving birth, Briony brought her newborn onto the yoga mat and hopes he will practice the discipline in the future.  

In a social media post, she said: '2 weeks postpartum and it's someone's first time on the mat ever. Yogi baby pending,' accompanied by a love heart.

The blonde beauty, revealed that the birth of their son was 'calm' despite him being born six weeks premature. 

The couple had only been trying for a baby for little over a month before getting the positive result and Briony revealed that nothing could have prepared her for the joys of parenthood. 

She said to her social media followers in August: 'Nothing could have truly prepared me for your entrance into this world; a journey of complete surrender and the most intense surges of energy I have ever felt in my life. 

'But I understand now that it had to be this way. How else could my heart come to live outside of my body?' 

Sam, whose Coronation Street character Chesney is parenting quads on the popular ITV soap, said he and Briony would love a big family but admitted they were glad they were just expecting the one child.

Sam and Briony tied the knot last year, two years after the couple announced their engagement.
