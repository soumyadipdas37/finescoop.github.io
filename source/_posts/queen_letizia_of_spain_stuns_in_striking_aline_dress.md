Queen Letizia of Spain stunned in a red dress yesterday as she joined her husband King Felipe at the Royal Theatre in Madrid.

The royal, 48, donned a face mask and striking lace A-line dress as she attended the inaugural theatre opening for the 2020/21 season.  

The mother-of-two, who recently returned from a nationwide tour with her husband and daughters, Princess Leonor, 14, and Princess Sofia, 12, looked relaxed as she waved at cameras.

The former journalist, who is known to reign high in the style stakes, paired her lace dress with a matching slingback stilettos which she complemented with a golden clutch bag.

Keeping jewellery to a minimum, Letizia opted for just a ring and dainty golden hoops.

Meanwhile, her husband Felipe donned a double breasted navy suit and powder blue tie with a pin-striped shirt.

Showing off her natural beauty, Letizia wore minimal make-up, donning a light lashing of mascara and a smokey-eyed look.

 It comes a day after the couple attended an  event at the National Library in Madrid, again donning protective face coverings for the grand opening.

Queen Letizia opted for a midi length blue dress for the occasion, matching the stunning gown with a simple navy bag and set of heels. 

The couple looked relaxed as they arrived at the reception and posed for pictures outside with Spanish Minister of Culture and Sports, Jose Manuel Rodriguez Uribes and the regional president of Castilla y Leon, Alfonso Fernandez Mañueco.

The exhibition is opening on what would have been the author's  100th birthday held at the National Library in the city. 

It comes amid a busy period for the royal couple, with Queen Letizia and King Felipe marking the 125th anniversary of local paper El Heraldo de Aragon (Aragon Herald) earlier this week at the newspaper's headquarters. 

Letizia married King Felipe 16 years ago at Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid.

The relationship began in November 2002 and in 2003, just months after she had been promoted to the position of anchor on the national news channel. 

She then quit her job and days later the royal engagement was announced.

The former newsreader is the granddaughter of a taxi driver and the eldest daughter of Jesús José Ortiz Álvarez, a journalist, and first wife María de la Paloma Rocasolano Rodríguez, a nurse and hospital union representative. 

She attended public high school and did a degree at the Complutense University of Madrid. She later gained an MA in Audiovisual Journalism at the Institute for Studies in Audiovisual Journalism.

King Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 in favour of his son, now King Felipe VI.
