Joanna Chimonides has revealed she rejected a string of offers to have lip fillers and cosmetic surgery for free.

The former Love Island star, 23, admitted she is 'insecure' about the size of her lips but wants to show her young fans they don't need to undergo cosmetic procedures.

Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, she said: 'I’ve been offered surgery, lip fillers and fat freezing for free and I turn it all down. It’s not for me.

'My lips are small and I’m insecure about them but I haven’t had filler put in. I use make-up and lots of lipliner.

'I want to show young girls that you don’t have to get cosmetic surgery.'

Joanna competed on last year's series of Love Island and found herself inundated with the offers after she left the villa.

Fellow Love Islander Maura Higgins previously revealed how she was also offered a variety of procedures after she took part in the show.

While she has admitted to having had lip fillers in the past, the TV star now wants to embrace her looks. 

She told The Sun: 'When you come out of Love Island you are offered everything from make-up and hair extensions to plastic surgery and operations. I just stick to what I know and love.

'I don’t want to get anything done to my body. I’ve got a flat bum and I’m just going to have to embrace it.

'I did go to a clinic to get Botox years ago but the doctor refused to do it and said I didn’t need it. I’m confident in my own skin.'

She said: 'My lips are small and I’m insecure about them but I haven’t had filler put in. I use make-up and lots of lip liner'

Joanna ruffled a few feathers on Love Island when she turned the head of Michael Griffiths during the famed Casa Amor week.

Michael was already coupled up with the eventual winner from that series Amber Gill when he started a relationship with Joanna.

The couple found themselves in the bottom two and were kicked off the show in week seven.

While they are no longer together, Joanna insisted she and Michael are now friends, adding that she thinks it's important not to carry 'negative weight' on your shoulders.
