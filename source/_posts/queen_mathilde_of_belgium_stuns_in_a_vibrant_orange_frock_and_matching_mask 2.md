Queen Mathilde of Belgium and King Philippe of Belgium joined their youngest daughter Princess Eleonore as she attended her first day of secondary school this morning. 

The family all sported masks when arriving at Heilig-Hartcollege in Wezembeek-Oppem, and Eleonore, 12, opted for a pink top and jeans, while carrying her school bag.

Mathilde put on a stunning display in a orange top and trouser combo with a matching mask as she appeared alongside her daughter and her husband. 

It's the second time the mother-of-four, 47, has sported the bold trouser suit, after first wearing it in May when visiting Oostnieuwkerke flower farm. 

All schools in Belgium are resuming on-site teaching from the start of the new academic year this month.

Highlighting her slender frame, she teamed her outfit with caramel-coloured heels and accessorised with a golden watch and burnt orange earrings.

She kept her makeup look natural, and opted for an elegant straight hairdo to complete her sophisticated style. 

King Philippe, 60, sported a black suit but jazzed up his outfit with a colourful tie.

Princess Eleonore did want to continue her studies at Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege, having completed her primary school education there, according to local media.

However, she had to accept her second choice of Heilig-Hartcollege because she doesn't have an older sibling at Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege and lives outside the catchment area.

Heilig-Hartcollege is a Dutch language catholic secondary school in the Brussels region.

She lives in the Royal Castle of Laeken with her parents and three siblings Princess Elisabeth, 18, Prince Emmanuel, 14, and Prince Gabriel, 16.

All schools in Belgium will resume on-site teaching from the start of the new academic year in September, it was announced in June.

For students in secondary education, the current plan means they will go to school four days a week and distance-learn on Wednesdays.
