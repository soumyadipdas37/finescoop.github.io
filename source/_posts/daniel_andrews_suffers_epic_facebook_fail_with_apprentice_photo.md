Two apprentices pictured alongside Daniel Andrews in a promotional photo have both lost their jobs due to his lockdown, Daily Mail Australia can reveal.

Mr Andrews used an old snap of a 2018 visit to Chisolm TAFE in a post spruiking his education agenda on Wednesday.

The picture, which was posted to his Facebook page followed by one million people, shows the premier smiling alongside Emily Roberts and Jack Sharlassian.

But the pair have been left furious at being associated with Mr Andrews because they have both lost their jobs during his 15-week lockdown of Melbourne.

In a comment on the post, Ms Roberts wrote: 'I'm the female apprentice standing next to Dan and all I can say is... this photo was taken two years ago and why you dragging me into this now brah?!

'I'm not your friend! I'm not even working (due to coronavirus lockdown in Melbourne)'.

Mr Sharlassian, a plumbing apprentice in his final year, has also lost his job due to the coronavirus-caused recession.

He told Daily Mail Australia: 'I've been laid off as well due to lockdown. I'm not too impressed with the pic. It seems like a joke.' 

Mr Sharlassian said the premier has gone too far with his coronavirus restrictions which keep Melburnians locked up at home for 22 hours of the day.

They will remain in place until 19 October even though fewer than 20 cases have been recorded each day for the past week. 

Victoria's second wave began in May when coronavirus escaped from two quarantine hotels and spread rapidly around the city.

Melbourne was placed into lockdown on 8 July and a curfew was imposed preventing residents from leaving home after 8pm, although that was removed earlier this week.

The federal treasury estimated the second lockdown would cost 400,000 jobs by Christmas. 

On Wednesday private security guards were pulled from a Melbourne quarantine hotel and replaced by police after a health worker raised fears about infection control breaches.

Guards employed by a services company were sent home from the Novotel in Southbank half way through their shift.

The state government took action after an anonymous health worker at the hotel tipped off a local newspaper with claims that infection control protocols were not being followed.   

Melbourne is not accepting international travellers but hotel quarantine is still being used to isolate coronavirus patients who cannot isolate at home. 

Opposition leader Michael O'Brien slammed the government for continuing to use private security guards. 

'This hopeless Labor government has learnt nothing from its hotel quarantine scandal that's already killed 781 Victorians,' he wrote. 

'They're still using private guards not up to the task. Andrews must go - his toxic mix of arrogance and incompetence is destroying Victoria.'

Victoria reported two more deaths and 15 infections overnight.
