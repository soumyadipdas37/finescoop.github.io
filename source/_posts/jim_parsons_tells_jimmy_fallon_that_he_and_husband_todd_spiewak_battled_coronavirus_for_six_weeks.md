Jim Parsons opened up to Jimmy Fallon about his battle with coronavirus earlier this year, as he and his husband Todd Spiewak both battled the pandemic for six weeks as it spread in mid-March.

'We didn't know what it was, we thought we had colds and then it seemed less likely, and then finally we lost all sense of smell and taste,' the Houston native, 47, told Fallon Monday on The Tonight Show.

He said he also bleached his hair amid the lockdown, which came with its own unpleasantness: 'About six weeks in, and we had been sick, I thought, "Screw it!"'

He said that Spiewak, 43, 'did it,' and that 'it took about six hours and it burned [his] scalp - but you know what, beauty is pain.' 

He opened up about the symptoms he endured amid the illness. 

'It defied the descriptions for me, I didn't realize how completely taste and smell could be gone,' he told Fallon, noting that it spoiled the eating experience as they quarantined.'That was brutal ... definition of wasted calories.'

The Boys in the Band star said he kept himself occupied with courses in painting and creative writing as he recuperated.

Parsons also spoke about the end of The Big Bang Theory while on The Tonight Show.

He told Fallon, 'It reminds me when someone died or passes and it feels so monumental for a moment and you think it's never going to end ... and then nine months go by and you're like "Life carries on." It was bittersweet when it ended, but it was fine.'

As of Wednesday, on a global level, 1,014,158 people have died amid 1,014,158 positive diagnoses worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University . The death total for COVID-19 in the U.S. was at 206,928 people, with 7,233,043 total positive diagnoses.

Parsons can be seen in The Boys in the Band, which is available for streaming on Netflix now.
