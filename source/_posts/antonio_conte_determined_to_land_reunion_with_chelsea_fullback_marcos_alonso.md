Antonio Conte is reportedly eyeing up a reunion with Marcos Alonso at Inter Milan this summer.

The pair worked together during the Italian's two-year spell in charge of Chelsea in which they won a Premier League and the FA Cup.

Alonso's future at Stamford Bridge is up in the air, particularly after Frank Lampard's side completed the signing of left-back Ben Chilwell from Leicester for £50m.

Marcos Alonso could be set to leave Chelsea following the arrival of Ben Chilwell this summer

Antonio Conte is reportedly 'determined' to reunite with the 29-year-old Spanish full-back

Sky Sports Italia are now reporting that Conte is 'determined' to bring Alonso to the club as he looks to build an even more competitive squad ahead of next season.

However any move could depend on potential outgoings from the Nerazzuri.

Out-of-favour Inter Milan full-back Dalbert has returned to the club from a loan spell at Fiorentina but is not expected to break into the side.

Should he leave the club this this summer, it is expected Conte will push forward with his pursuit of Alonso.

Together at Chelsea the pair won both the Premier League and FA Cup between 2016 and 18

It would not be the first time that Conte has reunited with one of his Chelsea title winners at Inter Milan.

Victor Moses who was a regular under Conte at Stamford Bridge, spent last-season on loan at Inter where he made 20 appearances in all competitions.

Alonso signed for Chelsea in 2016 from Fiorentina for a fee of around £24 million.

During that time he has scored 22 goals in 149 appearances for the club, but his game-time has dropped since Lampard was appointed last summer.
