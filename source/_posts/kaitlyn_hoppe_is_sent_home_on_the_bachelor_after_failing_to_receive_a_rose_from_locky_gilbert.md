Bachelor intruder Kaitlyn Hoppe was sent home on Thursday after failing to receive a rose from Locky Gilbert.

The 26-year-old personal assistant was left heartbroken after the suitor gave his final four roses to Irena Srbinovska, Bella Varelis, Bec Cvilikas and Izzy Sharman-Firth.

Prior to the rose ceremony, Kaitlyn admitted that she 'wasn't ready to go home' and wanted Locky to meet her family during hometowns visits.

'This rose ceremony is huge. This is the last rose ceremony before hometowns. It's one step closer to meeting the family with Locky,' she said.  

'So the stakes are high tonight. I'm not ready to go home, especially not right now,' she continued.

Kaitlyn entered the Bachelor mansion as an intruder and was awarded a one-on-one date with Locky on episode two of the show.

Last month, she got into a heated argument with co-star Roxi Kenny, leaving viewers of The Bachelor stunned. 

A jealous Roxi, 29, became furious after discovering that Kaitlyn had kissed leading man Locky Gilbert at the cocktail party.

At one stage, she said within earshot of Kaitlyn: 'I'm sorry but I think that's really rude to everyone else. You kissed someone at a cocktail party.' 

'That's classless. She's Gold Coast trash,' she added.

'This little silly b***h over here is saying she packed on with someone. It's disgusting. The b***h is a sl*t!'

As things became heated later on, Roxi labelled Kaitlyn 'Malibu Barbie gone wrong', before screaming over and over again that she was 'trash'.  

Viewers had plenty to say about the dramatic confrontation, with many fans picking sides on Twitter.

'Both Roxi and Kaitlyn were out of line tonight but I'm team Malibu Barbie, what a crack up,' tweeted one viewer.

'Mmmm kind of on Roxi's side, Kaitlyn is being horrendous,' another added.
