Roger Federer has been dragged into the dramatic Novak Djokovic saga just days after the Serbian was controversially defaulted from the US Open. 

The world No 1 was booted out of the Grand Slam in dramatic fashion when he swiped a ball to the back of the court angrily, only for it inadvertently to strike Kentucky-based official Laura Clark in the throat.

The line judge fell to the floor and after consultation with the referee, officials determined they had no option but to disqualify Djokovic.

But days on from the controversial incident, fans have been quick to slam the decision to disqualify Djokovic - claiming 20-time Grand Slam winner Federer wouldn't have faced the same punishment if he was in the Serbian's shoes.

Federer was involved in a similar incident 14 years ago at the Australian Open when he accidentally hit a ball boy.

After his first serve was called out, Federer swung his racket behind his back and inadvertently hit the ball boy at the side of the net.

The Swiss tennis star didn't receive a code violation and the situation was laughed off, including by the ball boy, at the time.

However, fans have since brought that incident back up as they have been comparing it to the Djokovic saga.

The incident involving Federer back in 2006 was laughed off by everyone court-side

The ball boy from that day wrote on Twitter: '2020: @DjokerNole hits line umpire...disqualified from the US Open. 2006: @rogerfederer does a trick shot and hits me...says 'you got to be ready' and has a chuckle.

'It's been 14 tough years, Roger, is it time for an apology?'

Meanwhile, another tennis fan simply said: 'If Federer did what Djokovic did he wouldn't be disqualified. The ATP hates to see Djokovic win.'

Another wrote: 'I'm not the biggest Djokovic fan but I would 100% agree that there was no anger or malice in that incident. 

'I can't believe the extent of his punishment. I also agree that had that been Federer it would have been a totally different outcome.'

Meanwhile, only two weeks ago at the Southern & Western Open - which Djokovic won - Aljaz Bedene accidentally struck a cameraman after hitting the ball away in frustration.

Bedene immediately apologised but the tournament official was called out to judge whether he should have been defaulted.

Fortunately for Bedene, he wasn't - receiving just a code violation instead.

And following that recent incident and Djokovic's disqualification, fans still found a way to bring Federer's name into it.

One fan wrote on social media: 'Good job guys, nice to see no.1 had the same treatment. I just hope he never plays here again. 

'I just wonder what decision would be if Federer was in this situation? @DjokerNole.'
