Norwich boss Daniel Farke insists Max Aarons has not had his head turned by talk of Barcelona interest and revealed the full-back has been dubbed 'Dani Alves' in training.

Aarons has reportedly been targeted by the Catalan giants but Farke says the 20-year-old full-back will feature in Sunday's Sky Bet Championship trip to Bournemouth.

'Several times we have been calling him Dani Alves or Barca and he has handled this with a smile,' Farke said at his pre-match press conference.

Max Aaron's has been linked with a move to Barcelona after impressing for Norwich 

Canaries chief Daniel Farke believes his young defender will take the speculation in stride

'When it is a difficult topic it is good to take the seriousness out of it.

'It is never easy but Max has the personality to handle it.'

Bournemouth and Norwich meet again in the second-tier just two months after suffering relegation from the Premier League.

Both sides are in the top-six after taking four points from two games, and Cherries boss Jason Tindall was delighted to see £17million striker Dominic Solanke score his first goal of the season in last weekend's 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough.

The Canaries were held to a 2-2 draw by Championship rival Preston in their last league fixture

'Ever since he signed for this football club Dom's attitude has been first-class,' Tindall said. 'He's a huge player for this football club.'

High-flying Bristol City seek to extend their 100 per cent league record against bottom-placed Sheffield Wednesday at Ashton Gate.

Robins boss Dean Holden said: 'They're a team who have started the season with an attitude of nothing to lose with their points deduction.'

Wednesday were deducted 12 points for breaching Profit and Sustainability rules and have yet to concede this season in picking up four points.
