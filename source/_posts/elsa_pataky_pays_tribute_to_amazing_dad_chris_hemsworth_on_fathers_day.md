While the message may have been a bit late, the sentiment was still there.

Elsa Pataky paid tribute to her husband of 10 years, Chris Hemsworth, in a belated Father's Day post on Instagram on Tuesday.

'A little late, but happy Father's Day to all the amazing dads out there. Especially to this one,' the 44-year-old Spanish-born actress wrote.

Elsa also included a photo of the 37-year-old Thor star in the bathtub with one of the couple's young sons.

Both Chris and the little boy had bubbles on their heads and faces, creating the impression of fake beards, as the buff actor stared wide-eyed at the camera.

Chris and Elsa are parents to daughter India, eight, and twins Tristan and Sasha, six.

In an interview with GQ Australia in May, Chris admitted that the older his children get, the 'harder' he finds it to be away from them for work.

'For a little while you don't think the kids notice and then you realise they do,' he said.

He explained that he often finds himself torn between wanting to make movies he's 'proud of' and being at home with his family.

'You can fall into a false sense of self-importance on a film set, where you feel you're special, so it's good to remind yourself that it's not that case. And kids certainly drive that home,' he added. 

In a separate interview with the same publication in 2018, Chris admitted that he struggled to understand how his sons can be 'so different' despite being twins. 

'Tristan is so athletic but there's not an aggressive bone in his body. He's the most emotional one. Whereas Sasha is like a little gangster,' he said at the time.
