A female prison guard accused of sex with an inmate has had her love affair with another ex-prisoner apparently end in tears - with the rapper accused of punching her and threatening to stomp on her head. 

Melissa Goodwin's former flame Caleb Valeri, 23, appeared before a western Sydney court on Friday charged with assaulting and stalking or intimidating Goodwin.  

Goodwin was stood down by Corrective Services NSW over a separate romance with a third prisoner, Corey London, earlier this year.

Afterwards, she began a relationship with ex-inmate Valeri, who she shared gushing social media posts about, describing him as 'my world, my king'.  

But wannabe rapper Valeri allegedly punched Goodwin in the face about 3pm on August 31, Penrith Local Court was told during a bail hearing on Friday.

Goodwin shared a series of gushing posts about the couple earlier this year - saythe couple at the gym together earlier this year, saying: 'He said he loves me thick' 

Goodwin described her ex-con lover as 'king' and 'my world' on Instagram previously but their relationship has now allegedly taken a disturbing turn

Police prosecutor Brian Johnson said Goodwin was 'crying, her hands were shaking profusely' when officers attended her home in Ingleburn on August 31.

Officers noted there was a 'large red mark on her left cheek' and described her as 'visibly upset', Mr Johnson.

AVO documents tendered in court earlier this week and detailed in a report by Seven News alleged that Goodwin had confronted Valeri about cheating on her.

That allegedly led him to exclaim: 'That was ten months ago'.

Valeri allegedly punched Goodwin in the face and she claimed to police he said: 'I'm going to shoot up your house, I'm gonna stomp on your's and your mum's head'. 

In opposing bail today, Mr Johnson told the court the incident was disclosed to police 'almost immediately after it occurred'.

Valeri appeared before the court by video link, dressed in a salmon pink T-shirt and black tracksuit pants and sporting 90s-style bleach blonde hair. He entered not guilty pleas. 

In seeking bail, Mr Valeri's lawyer Jessica Tohi said she didn't want to verbal Ms Goodwin, who wasn't present at court. But she said if there was evidence Goodwin had attempted to contact police to amend or contract her statement it would 'significantly undermine' her original complaint.

Goodwin was charged with misconduct and engaging in a relationship with an inmate, causing a safety risk earlier this year, in a case still before the courts. It came weeks after she appeared on the front cover the Corrective Services NSW magazine (pictured)

Goodwin's charges of misconduct in public office and engaging in a relationship with an inmate relate to Corey London (above), who she's accused of sex with

Ms Tohi told the court Valeri had made extensive attempts to seek mental health treatment in the lead up to the alleged incident.

That included seeking seven appointments with mental health professionals. 

But prosecutor Mr Johnson said the court could not have faith he would abide by bail conditions. 

'His record reads as someone who pays absolutely no attention or compliance to any form of court order or bail or even community corrections orders,' he said.

Mr Johnson noted he was on bail for allegedly intimidating his brother and other offences at the time of the alleged incident.

Magistrate Bree Chisholm said Valeri seeking mental health treatment was the 'strongest' evidence in favour of him being released.

But the magistrate then said there was no suggestion he wouldn't be able to get help in prison and that the safety of the public loomed large in her considerations.

Valeri was refused bail with his case to return to court at a later date.

The two charges Goodwin was hit with - of misconduct in public office and engaging in a relationship with an inmate - are still before the courts.
