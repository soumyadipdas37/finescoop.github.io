A high-flying business mogul who owns the aged care facility at the centre of one of Australia's worst coronavirus outbreaks has resigned from his top role.

Peter Arvanitis stepped down from his position as director of Heritage Care last week after details of his high-flying lifestyle, which includes luxury cars and million-dollar mansions, were revealed by Daily Mail Australia. 

Heritage Care owns the controversial Epping Gardens in north west of Melbourne, which has been linked to about 212 cases and at least 28 deaths.

Mr Arvanitis came under fire for his extravagant lifestyle after families of frail elderly residents complained about poor staffing and poor care at the facility before and during the crisis.

Heritage Care chief executive Greg Reeve told News Corp Australia that Mr Arvanitis' resigned as he was 'not wanting to be a distraction to the good work of staff'.

'Peter has decided to resign as a Director of Heritage Care effective immediately, but will maintain his partial ownership in the business,' he said.

He said Mr Arvanitis' acquired his wealth before his time at Heritage Care.

'It's not possible for any aged care operator to generate that degree of wealth from resident fees, and it's inaccurate to imply otherwise,' Mr Reeve said.

He said past business offerings, including the public offering of Estia Health which generated over $1 billion in 2014, had nothing to do with Heritage Care. 

Mr Arvanitis, who only joined Heritage Care a little over a year ago, was the founder and one-time director of listed for-profit nursing home giant Estia.

He sold his shareholding in 2016 for $55 million and quit the company after it hit trouble, the Sydney Morning Herald reported this week.

In 2018 he also sold a shopping centre he owned and a thoroughbred horse breeding farm, scoring another $21 million.

In May, they sold the family's Toorak mansion for an undisclosed amount somewhere in the range of $13 million. 

Th home had been described in Vogue Living as 'the Melbourne mansion with Gucci in almost every room'.

A 'digitally collaged tableau' on one wall told of 'the gluttonous trappings of wealth within a classical framework', the Vogue article said.

Ms Arvanitis's bedroom was described as a 'a first-floor boudoir that is off-the-charts big, fitted with banks of Gucci-filled cabinets and furnished with one-of-a-kind art and objects commissioned by the Italian fashion house in esteem of her patronage'.

Mr Arvanitis owns Heritage Care along with Tony Antonopoulos.

The company has a portfolio of nine residential aged care homes in Sydney and Melbourne.

Residents living within the facility reportedly pay up to $650,000 in a refundable deposit just to get into the place. 

Then they pay a daily fee. 

Last week the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission announced it had taken action against Epping Gardens for breaching care and management standards.

It found Epping Gardens in breach of 16 standards, including requirements that residents get safe and effective clinical care, that there be effective management of high-impact or high-prevalence risks, and that the risk of infection be minimised.

Their home had been described in Vogue Living as 'the Melbourne mansion with Gucci in almost every room'.

Just months earlier the regulator had given it a clean bill of health. 

The Guardian reported other standards being breached included a requirement to have systems in place for 'identifying and responding to abuse and neglect of consumers'. 

Epping Gardens is now under the control of staff from Victorian health authority Austin Health, which covers Melbourne's north-east.

It is now one of four facilities to be taken over by state or federal health authorities amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

Families of residents housed at Epping Gardens have lashed out at the care they had been provided since learning of the outbreak about a week before sick patients were evacuated. 

Many describe disturbing scenes of neglect, with one man claiming his dead mother lay in the home for 26 hours as he tried to make arrangements to pick up her body.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the company for additional comment.
