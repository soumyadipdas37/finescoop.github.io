A police officer 'screamed for help' after he was hit by a car during a stabbing in north London last night, it has been claimed.   

The officer was responding to reports of a stabbing outside Manor House station in Finsbury Park when he was reportedly hit.  

Witnesses said they saw a white car speed through a police cordon that had been set up to investigate the incident. The officer suffered injuries to his arm and leg.  

Community reverend Efrayim Goldstein said he was one of the first to help at around 2am, unzipping the officer's jacket so he could breath properly.

He said the officer had been standing behind the cordon and had signalled to the car to stop before it swerved at the last second and clipped him.  

'He was not breathing properly,' Mr Goldstein told the Mirror. 

'He said 'please help me'. He was kneeling onto the other officer and then went back on to the ground. I then supported his back with my body so he could open his zip.

'He was lucky. He could've died. He was screaming and crying.'

London Ambulance Service took over at the scene.

The Met Police said: 'Police dealt with a stabbing in Seven Sister Rd this morning. Victim sustained single stab wound. Suspect remain outstanding.
