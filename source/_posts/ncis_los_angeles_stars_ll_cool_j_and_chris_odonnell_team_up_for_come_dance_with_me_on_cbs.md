The show will center on, 'exceptionally talented young dancers from all across the country,' who will find a new dance partner within their family.

The dancer will either select, 'one inspirational, and untrained family member' or another 'adult who has supported their dance dreams.

Together they will train to 'strut their stuff for a grand prize,' with the youngsters sharing their love of dance.

What follows is described as, 'an uplifting and emotional journey to learn and perform challenging routines, with the assistance of professional choreographers, in a competition with other duos,' according to the official description. 

'We believe this concept is fun for the whole family, especially given the number of children we both have,' executive producers LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnell  said in a joint statement.

'We reminisced about our kids' dance lessons and how it would look if they had to teach us how to dance,' they added.

The acting duo, who have starred on NCIS: Los Angeles for the past 11 seasons, with Season 12 coming soon, added that they noticed one key similarity.

'What we noticed was, aside from the two-left-feet element, like most parents, no one wants to let their kids down. The show is about being creative, having a good time and bringing families together through dance. It's a fun show with a big heart!" 

LL Cool J and O'Donnell will executive produce alongside 3 Ball Productions' Reinout Oerlemans, Ross Weintraub and Jeff Altrock.
