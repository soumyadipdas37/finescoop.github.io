Actress Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Aimee Gibbs, recently spoke to Digital Spy about her hopes of the show making it to screens by early next year as she said: 'It looks like it's on track.' 

And after having already read a script for the first episode of season three, she teased that it's 'really, really good'.

She went on: 'I'm desperate to see more. I'm so desperate, especially because I feel like the last season left us all in such interesting positions. But where the characters could go now is kind of limitless.'

It was revealed back in February that Sex Education has been renewed for a third season.

Fans had been on the edge of their seat since the series two ended with a cliffhanger on the future of central couple Otis (Asa Butterfield) and Maeve's (Emma Mackey) relationship.

The show's first season revolved largely around Otis falling for bad-girl Maeve and his effort to lose his virginity.

The awkward high school student made a name for himself offering sex advice to students despite not actually engaging in the act himself, since his mother (Gillian Anderson) is a well-known sex therapist.

The series' writer and creator Laurie Nunn has been anticipating and preparing for a next season, since the second season dropped in January 2020.

Before the series was picked up for the third season, she told LADbible in January: 'I've started writing series three, but that's just a very normal part of the process because we work on such tight schedule, and season three hasn't been greenlit yet or officially commissioned.'
