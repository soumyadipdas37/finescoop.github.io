A Disney loving little boy has gone viral after his father shared pictures of him recreating a scene from Toy Story as he headed off to school.

Dean Donnelly, 32, from Loughborough, Leicestershire collected all his son's favourite toys and lined them up in the doorway to say 'goodbye' to his four-year-old son Vinny as he headed to the first day of class.

In an adorable photo, the toys, which include Buzz Lightyear, Rex, Slink, Jessie and Woody wave goodbye to him in an image that echoes the famous scene from Toy Story 3 where Andy leaves for University. 

'We decided to recreate the moment in Toy Story 3 where Andy leaves his toys behind when we did the traditional back to school photo,' Dean explained.

'I do quite like doing photography myself to get interesting shots and what have you.

'I think that story connected with the pictured is one people can identify with too. If you have got kids you kind of know that feeling,' he added.

Since posting the heartwarming images on Facebook on Tuesday more than 30,000 people across the world have viewed and shared them.

Lorry driver Dean added: 'He's a massive Toy Story fan and he has all the toys, characters and watches the films a lot.

'My partner Charlotte shared it on a lockdown page on Facebook where it had over 30,000 likes and so many comments on it.

'Lots of people found it emotional and that it made them cry. I tried to make it look dark inside where the toys were and light outside where he was.'

Children across the country headed back to class yesterday after a five-month break following Boris Johnston's decision to close school's in March 

Part of the Covid-secure measures mean modern arrangements, which used to see pupils opposite each other around desks, have been axed to prevent any risk of infection.

Instead they are now required to sit in rows facing their teacher in a move expected to have the welcome side-effect of greater learning.

Dean explained that he wanted to make sure his little one got a good send off following a difficult year. 

'I wanted it to look like his future was bright, that sort of thing. It's been quite tough for all children really this year,' he explained.

'It's a weird situation to be in and just starting school for Vinny has been strange for him.

'He's been stuck by his mum's side constantly for five months.

'He will certainly be out of his comfort zone for a while. Fortunately, he is loving it so far.

'His older sister Darcy is in Year 3 now so he has her to go with him.

Toy Story was Pixar's first feature film, and the first entirely computer-animated film. It was a huge smash hit, and led to a whole subgenre that includes Frozen, Moana, Coco, Zootopia, Inside Out, Brave, Tangled, and many more 

'It's quite scary with what is going on at the moment, even mentally for the kids.

Toy Story was Pixar's first feature film, and the first entirely computer-animated film. 

It was a huge smash hit, and led to  a whole subgenre that includes Frozen, Moana, Coco, Zootopia, Inside Out, Brave, Tangled, and many more. 

The third installment, which came out in 2010, starred Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, making it only the second PIxar film to nab the honour.

It won Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song at the awards, and made over $1 billion worldwide.

Speaking of the photo of his son, Dean added:  'We will definitely blow it up and have it on the walls of our house somewhere. It will be a great picture for him to have and look back on.

'It's great to have a positive image for him to have. His mum and I are really proud but he isn't that fussed.' 

'Being stuck at home, people wearing masks and washing your hands, it must be hard for them to go through.

'They are getting fed up too, wanting to see their friends and go out and do stuff more regularly.
