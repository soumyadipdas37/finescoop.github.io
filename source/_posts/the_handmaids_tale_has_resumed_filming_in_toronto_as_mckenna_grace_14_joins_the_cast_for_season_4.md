Production on Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale was halted in mid-March due to the coronvirus.

And while fans of the Elisabeth Moss-led series will have to wait until sometime next year for new episodes, Deadline.com reported Thursday that filming on the show has finally resumed.

The outlet also revealed that 14-year-old actress Mckenna Grace is joining the cast as the teenage wife of a much older Commander in the dystopian drama.

Back in action: The Handmaid's Tale starring Elisabeth Moss resumed filming for its fourth season two weeks ago in Toronto, Canada, Deadline.com reported on Thursday 

Mckenna, whose credits include The Haunting of Hill House, Troop Zero and the upcoming Ghostbusters: Afterlife, will play a character called Mrs. Keyes.

She is described as 'a sharply intelligent, teenage wife of a much older Commander who rules her farm and household with confidence. 

'She has a rebellious, subversive streak, and is calm and pious on the outside with turmoil, even insanity, on the inside.'

Work on season four started back up two weeks ago in Toronto, Canada, according to Deadline.

New role: Child star Mckenna grace, 14, is joining the cast as the teenage wife of a much older Commander. Her character is described as having a 'rebellious, subversive streak'

The drama based on Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel premiered on Hulu in 2017 and quickly garnered a huge following.

Former Mad Men star Moss is the protagonist June, who is captured while trying to flee the fictional Gilead with her husband and daughter and ends up, renamed Offred, as a Handmaid whose role is to bear children for infertile ruling elite couples.

By the end of the third season, Moss' character has navigated life in the religiously oppressive Gilead to the point where she has succeeded in rescuing dozens of girls and helping them escape to neighboring Canada.

She, though, has returned to Gilead where her own daughter Hannah remains and at the end of the last episode, she was seen being shot by guards.

It sets the scene for season four to follow June and other Handmaids, along with help from the Marthas, or house servants, as they seek to destroy their oppressors or be destroyed by them.

Hulu has not yet announced precisely when The Handmaid's Tale will return to its streaming service.
