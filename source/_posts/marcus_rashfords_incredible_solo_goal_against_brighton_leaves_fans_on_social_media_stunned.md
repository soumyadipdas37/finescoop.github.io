Marcus Rashford was at his dazzling best on Saturday, scoring a solo stunner in Manchester United's dramatic victory over Brighton. 

The Englishman has been earning plaudits off the pitch all summer but in United's second game of the 2020-21 season the 22-year-old is reminding everyone of his incredible ability. 

Rashford ran on to a glorious Bruno Fernandes pass in the 54th minute, which was where the influence of his team-mates ended. He twisted Ben White into a heap, cut inside, chopped back once more and smashed into the net for 2-1.  

Marcus Rashford scored a glorious solo goal for Manchester United against Brighton 

The forward turned Brighton's defence inside-out, dribbling through in the 54th minute 

The striker then rifled into the net, getting his scoring tally underway for the 2020-21 season

The forward made a huge step up last season, firing in 17 goals in 31 top-flight games and contributing eight assists. He'll be looking to back that up this season.  

Much of the praise directed at Rashford on social media had reference to the youngster's off-field work, having continued to be a force for good since lockdown after successfully lobbying the Government to continue their free school meals scheme.  

Pogba Senior joked on Twitter: 'Rashford will end a defender's career so they can't feed their kids and then he'll go by himself and feed their kids.' 

Bruno Fernandes assisted the forward, before scoring the winning penalty for Man United 

'Marcus Rashford, dropping school meals on a Friday night to dropping Ben White on a Saturday afternoon,' @ManUnitedMedia added. 

Keeping focused on the football, @Donatog87 said: 'Marcus Rashford take a bow! Great goal. Incredible composure on the play.' 

The Old Trafford side ran out 3-2 winners at the final whistle after Bruno Fernandes' controversial 100th minute penalty, ending an enthralling game as United bounced-back from their dour opening day defeat to Crystal Palace.
