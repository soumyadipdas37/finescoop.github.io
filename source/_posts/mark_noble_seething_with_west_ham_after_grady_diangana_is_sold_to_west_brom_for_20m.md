West Ham captain Mark Noble has tweeted about his anger over the club's sale of winger Grady Diangana to Premier League rivals West Brom.

Noble, who has played for the Hammers since 2004, was left 'gutted, angry and sad' that the club decided to let Diangana leave on a permanent deal to West Brom - the club he played for on loan the previous season.

He wrote: 'As captain of this football club I’m gutted, angry and sad that Grady has left, great kid with a great future!!!!!'

The winger played a huge part in Slaven Bilic's Baggies side last season that earned automatic promotion back to the topflight.

Ultimately, Diangana opted to rejoin the former Hammers boss at the Hawthorns in another disappointing transfer blow for the London club.

Other players showed their support for Noble, as Chelsea target Declan Rice liked the captain's tweet in a show of support as the players showcase their displeasure with Diangana's sale.
