'The whole situation is disgusting. I really didn't want to give it attention,' she said in the clip.

'I feel so enraged that I even have to talk about it.'

She went on to say 'there is not one bit of f***ing truth' to the allegations against her.

Ahead of her court appearance she posted a video to Instagram where she flipped her middle finger to the camera, captioning the video 'not guilty'.
