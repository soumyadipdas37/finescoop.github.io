Raccoons are terrorizing San Francisco's Golden Gate Park because they have become used to humans feeding them.

Many visitors to the popular park have complained of being attacked and mobbed by the creatures which are normally nocturnal and skittish.

Heather Buren was recently walking her dog in the public grounds when she was surrounded by a horde of aggressive raccoons, hissing and lunging at her.

She told KPIX-TV: 'One of the raccoons started coming out of the bridge and started coming at us. 

'I was able to take this [dog leash] and I started swinging, and so there were three of them aggressively surrounding us… I was yelling at them, they were not backing down.' 

Local resident Sylvia Ramirez says the emboldened animals living in redwood trees in her backyard now come down and go under her deck, something they have never done before.

She also recalled a raccoon coming right up to her in the middle of the day while she was walking on a trail recently. 

A viral video last week also showed a father and son coming across a gang of 14 raccoons in the park.

Marc Estoque and his son Ever were walking their dog Zeus on a trail when they spotted the large group looking inquisitive.

The animals appear to have a standoff with Zeus, with the dog's owners warning it not to get too close

A coyote was also seen hiding in the bushes near the group of animals during their outing

San Francisco Animal Care and Control Executive Director Virginia Donohue says people are to blame for the animals' behaviour.

She believes the constant feeding has taken away the raccoons' natural fear of humans.   

Park rangers in Golden Gate Park have increased patrols and warned visitors not to feed wildlife.

There was a rise in the number of raccoon sightings in the area three years ago and now they appear to becoming bolder

Donohue said: 'People think they're helping the raccoon. They feed the raccoon, but if the raccoon gets to be too aggressive, eventually the parks will have to trap them, and once they're trapped they have to be euthanized because you can't relocate them.'

San Francisco City College professor and urban wildlife expert Matthew Schweitzer told SFist that raccoons gather in packs to beg for food and often become aggressive.

Fewer cars and people due to the coronavirus pandemic means the animals could be even more prevalent at the moment and taking over the park.
