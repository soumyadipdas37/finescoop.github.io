This is the amusing moment a woman struggles to unlock the door without noticing that the other section is missing glass.

Marichu Gaston had just finished indoor table tennis at a building in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during a day off. 

She holds the key to the building entrance and uses it to unlock the door when the group are about to leave.  

Marichu Gaston was trying to open at a building in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but didn't realise the door next to it was missing a glass panel 

She appears fixated on the door, and turns the key several times before finally managing to pull it open. 

As soon as the glass door is unlocked one of her friends steps through the adjoining door which she hasn't realised is missing a glass panel.

When Ms Gaston realises her mistake the group erupt into laughter, and everyone steps through the other door. 

As soon as the glass door is unlocked one of her friends steps through the adjoining door which she hasn't realised has been open the whole time 

She closes the door to the main entrance and follows the crowd through the missing panel.      

One of the women in the video said: 'She actually doesn't have any clue that the door is broken but we just let her do it and see her innocent reaction.'

The video was taken in a building on Jalan Damansara, a major road in Kuala Lumpur, and one of the oldest in the city. 

The hilarious moment happened on August 16. 

She appears fixated on the door, and turns the key several times before finally managing to pull it open while the group watch 

When Ms Gaston realises her the other door was open all along the group erupt into laughter, and everyone steps through the missing panel
