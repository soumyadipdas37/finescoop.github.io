She is used to flaunting her figure in lingerie and bikinis.  

Yet Alessandra Ambrosio was wowing in clothes on Wednesday evening as she headed for dinner in a sizzling ensemble in West Hollywood. 

The Brazilian beauty, 39, looked sensational in a wrap top and high-waisted trousers, in which she was showcasing her braless state by preening and posing.

Alessandra looked incredible in the sexy wrap top which made the most of both her abs and her perky cleavage as she strutted down the Hollywood streets. 

As she displayed her frame, it is easy to wonder how she stays in shape - the secrets of which she revealed in a interview about her workouts with Tracy Anderson. 

Speaking about how she prepares for the annual Victoria's Secret fashion show, she said: 'I train the whole year, and right before [the Victoria's Secret show] I start to train a bit more than the rest of the year....  

'I love to workout, and I love to do Tracy Anderson. I get very focused on being fit and feeling good for the runway.

'I try to go three times a week to Tracy Anderson, then I will for a hike one day of the week or do yoga. Sometimes I feel like I need to do more yoga, and other times I feel I need more toning, which is what Tracy is all about...

'It really depends how I feel and the strength I have at the time.'

Alessandra rose to international fame as a Victoria's Secret Angel, announcing that she was giving up the title at the end of 2017.

She has since collaborated with her sister Aline and a pal called Gisele Coria to launch her swimwear line Gal Floripa, which debuted last March.

The brand takes its title from a nickname for Florianopolis, the Brazilian city where Alessandra gave birth to both of her children.

Alessandra shares her 12-year-old daughter Anja and her eight-year-old son Noah with her ex-fiance, RE/DONE founder Jamie Mazur. The couple split in March 2018 after a 10 year engagement, and amicably co-parent their children. 

In July that year, Alessandra revealed she was dating Italian businessman Nicolo Oddi and spent the last few months in lockdown isolating with her boyfriend and her children.
