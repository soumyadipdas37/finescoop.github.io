The frustrations for a boxer who would be on the brink of a world title challenge now but for coronavirus prolonging his absence from the ring beyond a year are plaguing Joshua Buatsi.

Yet even though the threatened second national lockdown would pile on those agonies for Britain’s fast-rising light-heavyweight championship contender he will not be taking enforcement of the latest Covid restrictions into his own fists.

Buatsi is due to box again behind closed doors on Sunday October 4 on Sky Sorts and is praying his comeback against undefeated Croatian Marco Calic is not called off.

That risk would grow if too many members of the public flout the latest government rules but he says: ‘I do what we’re all being told. I wear my mask and all that. I hope everyone in London will do the same. But even if I see people disobeying I won’t be using my boxing skills to force them to behave.

‘I just have to hope that nothing goes badly wrong in London in the next couple of weeks. And that we can then get back to having crowds at boxing from early next year.’

The return of the fans will be crucial to the progress of both Buatsi, with his all-win record of ten KO’s in 12 fights and his local rival Anthony Yarde, who was first to get a world title fight and came close to defeating the ferocious Sergey Kovalev in Russia last summer.

Even though they fight under rival promotional banners – Buatsi for Eddie Hearn and Yarde for Frank Warren – it seems inevitable they will collide in the ring at some point.

There is a clamour for that to happen sooner rather than later and Buatsi says: ‘I’m ready for whenever an agreement can be reached for us to fight each other.’

But he also views an even more thrilling prospect of them both winning versions of the world title next year and then disputing a unified championship in a huge domestic battle in a London football stadium by the end of 2021.

‘That would be really exciting,’ says Buatsi. ‘It would make up for all the disappointments of the 13 months since I fought last. I’ve kept training and stayed optimistic even though I feel that if I’d had three more fights in that time I would already be set up for a world title bid next year.

‘This has been a difficult time for boxers everywhere but I’m itching go now. Calic is a decent opponent and I need to make a big impact by beating him impressively.’

Buatsi v Calic will be televised live on Sky Sports Arena on Sunday October 4.
