The estranged wife of rap mogul Dr. Dre has been accused of embezzling money from a limited company set up by the former couple in 2015.

Attorneys for Record One recording studio claim Nicole Young has drained funds from the company's primary business account, five years after setting up the company with her husband, 55.

In a letter obtained by TMZ, the 50-year old is accused of "blatant and unjustifiable criminal embezzlement of corporate funds" by attorney Ed McPherson, a representative for the limited liability company (LLC) responsible for managing Record One. 

Controversy: The estranged wife of rap mogul Dr. Dre has been accused of embezzling money from a limited company set up by the former couple in 2015

A check for $363,571.85, allegedly written by Young, addressed to herself and dated August 27th, 2020 has also been submitted as evidence of her 'draining' the company coffers. 

Young's lawyer Brian Freedman has since dismissed the claim as a tactical move by Dre - real name Andre Young - telling TMZ: 'This is just a low-grade PR stunt by Andre and his team to try to change the fact that he was caught red-handed and sued for trying to cheat Nicole out of community property to which she is entitled. 

'There is no question that Nicole had both the legal right to have taken this action and Andre's team is well aware of this fact. Any suggestion she did something untoward is preposterous and pathetic.'

Record One launched in 2015 with the former couple and business associate Larry Chatman serving as officers of its LLC. 

Hitting out: Attorneys for Record One recording studio claim Nicole Young has drained funds from the company's primary business account

Young previously claimed she co-owns the trademark to his name in explosive court documents submitted after their separation was confirmed in June.

In her lawsuit, Young alleged that Dre 'secretly' transferred 'valuable trademarks' to a 'newly created asset' holding company, including his 1992 debut album, The Chronic. 

Young's team reported that Dre's transfer of property, which 'he owned with' the mother of his two children, occurred without her 'knowledge or consent.'  

Bombshell: Young previously claimed she co-owns the trademark to his name in explosive court documents submitted after their separation was confirmed in June.

Then, she alleges, he 'threatened to file divorce.'  

'Two days after the threat, Nicole had no choice and initiated divorce proceedings. Andre's transparent and reprehensible scheme to transfer these assets away, without Nicole's knowledge or consent, so he could retain more for himself in a divorce from his wife of 24 years, and the mother of his three children, is an epic failure and reveals the true nature of his character, or lack thereof,' according to papers obtained by Page Six. 

The latest suit furthers that the 'valuable trademarks' were filed during Andre's years married to Nicole, which coincided with Andre's years of rising success in the music industry.' 

At odds: The pair, who are reportedly at odds over a prenuptial agreement, share two children - son Truice Young, 23 and daughter Truly Young, 19 (pictured, with Dre)

This would make the trademarks 'community property pursuant to California Family Code Section 760.' 

Meanwhile, sources close to Dre, say the allegations are 'ridiculous' and an 'attempt to embarrass him into submission,' according to TMZ. 

The insider added: 'It's the act of a desperate woman who finally realized that the iron-clad prenup she signed doesn't win her the lottery.' 

In addition to accusing him of hiding assets, the outlet revealed she is claiming to be the 'victim of physical, emotional and financial abuse' during their relationship.  

Better times: Young, who was previously wed to NBA player Sedale Threatt, said she initially signed one before their May 25, 1996 wedding, but Dr. Dre later destroyed it during the better times in the marriage two years later

'In their 26 years together, there has never been any hint or claim of threatened or actual physical violence and the insinuation is an insult to actual victims of domestic abuse,' the insider claims. 

Young filed for divorce from The Next Episode artist earlier this summer after 24 years of marriage. 

The pair, who are reportedly at odds over a prenuptial agreement, share two children - son Truice Young, 23 and daughter Truly Young, 19. 

Court battle: Earlier this month, she submitted a justification for her request for a stunning $2 million per month in her divorce proceedings

Young, who was previously wed to NBA player Sedale Threatt, said she initially signed one before their May 25, 1996 wedding, but Dr. Dre later destroyed it during the better times in the marriage two years later.

Earlier this month, she submitted a justification for her request for a stunning $2 million per month in her divorce proceedings. 

According to the filings, the vast majority of her expenses are listed as 'Entertainment,' and she's seeking $900,000 per month to cover those costs. 

Young also says she needs $10,000 per month to keep the house clean and to get her laundry done, and she needs another $135,000 to pay for new clothes each month. 

She including $60,000 monthly for education costs, including tuition and living expenses, though she didn't specify if that was for her own education efforts or if it was to pay for either her son Truice, 23, or daughter Truly Young, 19.

Justifying he request: Young also says she needs $10,000 per month to keep the house clean and to get her laundry done, and she needs another $135,000 to pay for new clothes each month

Dre's soon-to-be ex is also looking to keeping her charitable donations in place with $125,000 each month. 

She's also on the hook for a $100,000 per month mortgage, and she says she needs a head-scratching $20,000 each month to pay for her telephone, cell phone and email use.

Although all her individual expenses weren't listed, her total monthly expenses came out to $2,530,000, so her request for $1,936,399 is actually more modest than what she had been spending.

As of now, Dre is covering all of her expenses.

In the filings, Young contends that the NWA member has been cutting off her allowance and has prevented her from using her American Express Black Card.

Accusations: Young claimed Dre sending his brother-in-law to pick up his Glock at her house, and wrote that he was violent during their marriage

Young claims that the marriage began to go sour on April 1, when the Chronic rapper became intoxicated at their home in their Los Angeles home and began shouting, 'F*** you. F*** you. Get the f*** out. Get the f*** out. Go to Malibu.'

Dre is allegedly so angry at the accounting of his finances going on due to the divorce proceedings that he's threatening 'war.'

Young described a chilling incident in the documents in which she became frightened of her husband after he sent his brother-in-law to the Malibu home where she was staying to pick up his Glock handgun.

She refused to give it up at the time and said that Dre had a 'history of violence and coercive control, both before and during the marriage,' though she doesn't specify any incidents of domestic violence.

Way back: Young also wants the Beats by Dre mogul, 55, to pay her $5 million in fees she's spent on their split, TMZ reported; seen in 2001 

The rapper infamously assaulted fellow rapper and TV host Dee Barnes in 1991, and he has been accused of other instances of domestic abuse since then.

'Any man that puts his hands on a female is a fucking idiot,' he said of the incidents in his 2017 docuseries The Defiant Ones.

Young wrote that Dre sent her text messages that she found threatening after their separation, including one exchange that read, 'Why are you ignoring me? Why are you ignoring me ... should I come see you?'

Young also wants the Beats by Dre mogul, 55, to pay her $5 million in fees she's spent on their split, TMZ reported. 

MailOnline has contacted a representative for further comment.
