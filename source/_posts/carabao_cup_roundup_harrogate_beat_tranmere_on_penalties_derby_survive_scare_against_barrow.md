EFL newboys Harrogate booked their place in the second round of the Carabao Cup with a dramatic penalty shoot-out win over Tranmere.

James Vaughan had given the Sky Bet League Two side the lead just after the hour, but Lloyd Kerry soon equalised.

With no further goals, the tie went to the lottery of a shoot-out, which Harrogate came through 8-7 when Joshua Falkingham converted after Rovers defender Emmanuel Monthe had missed.

Luton, though, made sure it would not be a positive start to the new domestic campaign for the Norfolk club, missing several players through international duty.

Collins broke the deadlock with a penalty after 79 minutes, only for Kieran Dowell - signed from Everton last month - to quickly equalise.

The Hatters, however, had the final say as Collins struck again in the 83rd minute and completed his treble in stoppage time.
