On Monday's grand finale episode of The Masked Singer Australia, the celebrity inside the Bushranger costume was finally revealed. 

It was none other than Neighbours star, Bonnie Anderson, 25. 

Continuing her winning streak, Dannii Minogue yet again guessed right, disagreeing with Dave Hughes who was long convinced it was Jessica Mauboy.

It's her! It was none other than Neighbours actress, Bonnie Anderson (pictured) 

Emerging from the costume, Bonnie, who was the first winner of Australia's Got Talent in 2007, said she was excited to return to singing after a stint acting. 

'I haven't really been singing for a while, you know. Neighbours has kind of taken a lot of my time, so it has kind of sparked up a little bit of fire in me,' she said. 

Bonnie added that she struggled to keep her identity hidden from friends and family. 

'It's very hard to lie on this show, I tell you. All of my family, my friends, all of you watching, were bugging me. 

'I'm a terrible liar but I think my acting skills came in to play. It's a good feeling and I can't believe that I won this thing!' she concluded excitedly. 

Earlier in the episode, the runner up, Queen, was revealed to be quirky singer Kate Miller-Heidke. 

It was another correct guess for Dannii Minogue, who had been sure the songstress was inside the mask for some time. 

Kate said after being unmasked:  'I had so much fun. It was just...crazy and one of the most extreme experiences I've ever had.

Kate added of her time on the show: 'It's super liberating, you know? I got, yeah, leave myself and my own normal hang-ups behind'

'Like, I can barely see anything out of the mask, so this is the first time I've ever seen you guys. This is the first time I've seen what this room looks like.' 

She went on to reveal that her costume weighed a whopping 15 kilos. 

'It's really bloody heavy. And it's got momentum, too. Like, if I go in one direction, I've got to watch the inertia 'cause it might pull me back!' she said. 

Kate added of her time on the show: 'It's super liberating, you know? I got, yeah, leave myself and my own normal hang-ups behind and just step into this really strong, larger-than-life character.'
