She was the centre of plenty of drama during her time on The Bachelor. 

But Roxi Kenny, 29, nearly didn't make it to the mansion, after a nasty accident reportedly left her in hospital just two weeks before filming began in March.

According to So Dramatic! podcast, the mechanical engineer received 12 stitches after 'cracking her head open on a metal ceiling fan'.

The Queensland-based beauty's stitches were removed just a few days before she flew into Sydney to begin filming.

Roxi reportedly kept her accident a secret from producers because she feared they might axe her from the show.  

'So, when she rocked up to filming she still had cuts and bruises on her face but she did manage to cover them up pretty well with makeup,' the podcast alleged.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Roxi Kenny for comment.   

It comes after Roxi broke her silence on the real reason for her tearful departure from The Bachelor last Thursday.  

Speaking to The Courier Mail on Friday, the blonde said: 'There was something said to me off camera that was the straw that broke the camel's back. It hit below the belt.'

The mechanical engineer decided not to divulge what exactly happened, but spoke of the deep impact it had on her.

'I don't think it's important that people know what was said, but at the same time it was the one thing that pushed me that far over the edge,' she told the publication.  

The revelation came after dramatic scenes saw Roxi exit the mansion on Thursday after going on an expletive-laden tirade and flipping the bird at Juliette. 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
