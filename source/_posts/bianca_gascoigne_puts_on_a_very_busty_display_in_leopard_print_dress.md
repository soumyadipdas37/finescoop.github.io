They recently returned from their first holiday together in Croatia.

And Bianca Gascoigne put on a loved-up display with her boyfriend Kris Boyson as they attended the Peng Hair launch party at Jin Bo Law bar in London on Tuesday.

The glamour model, 33, showed off her ample assets in a clingy leopard print midi dress for the beauty event.

The blonde beauty upped the fashion stakes with strappy black heels and a black over-the-shoulder bag while Kris, 31, looked smart in a tweed jacket and navy chinos.

The adopted daughter of former footballer Paul Gascoigne wore her long blonde tresses in loose waves over her shoulders and opted for a typically glamorous makeup look for the night out.

Also attending the star-studded event was Joey Essex, 30, who looked effortlessly cool in a cream shirt and white jeans.

Despite dating for only five months, the reality stars admitted they'd definitely want to get married and start a family in the future as they 'completely trust' each other.

Katie Price's ex told new! magazine: 'We've spent every single day together practically since we met. 

'You wouldn't lock down with someone for 100 days if it was a showmance.'

Bianca and Kris were introduced to each other three years ago when he provided her with healthy meals in preparation of a charity fight, which got cancelled when her opponent, his ex Katie Price, pulled out.

They lost contact for a while, before fitness enthusiast Kris slid into her Instagram DMs earlier this year. 

The couple currently reside in Kent and are renovating their pad with a cinema room and a new bar.
