She was recently spotted in the company of her longtime friend and former flame Jaden Smith, 22, amid her split from ex Scott Disick, 37. 

But Sofia Richie looked every bit the single lady on Monday afternoon as she hung out on the beach with pals in Malibu on Labor Day.

The 22-year-old model stunned in a white crop top and black short shorts before changing into a red, white, and black striped bikini.

The duo, who reportedly dated in 2012 when they were just 14, sat right next to one another as they chowed down. 

Though it's unclear whether or not she is rekindling her romance with Jaden, Sofia is currently single following her split from ex Scott Disick, 37.

Sofia and Scott ended their three-year relationship in May, following the Talentless founder's brief stint at a Colorado rehab facility.

Two-months after their breakup, the pair reunited at a Fourth Of July party in Malibu. 

But by mid-August, numerous outlets reported that Scott and Sofia decided to end their relationship for good. 

Instead of galavanting around town with Sofia, Scott has been spending tons of quality time with his ex Kourtney Kardashian, 41, and their three children, sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight. 

Jaden also has a connection to the Kardashian clan due to the fact that he reportedly dated Kylie Jenner, 23, in 2013. Just months after his alleged split from Sofia.
