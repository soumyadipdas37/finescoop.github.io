A topless Tennessee woman who was spotted chewing on a miniature horse’s mane and told cops it was made of 'laffy taffy and airhead candy' has been charged with public intoxication.

Cynthia Teeple, 47, of Jacksboro, was seen chomping down on the animal hair as well as grass and dirt on the ground outside a home in LaFollette last month, according to the Campbell County Sheriff’s Office.

Teeple, whose mouth was allegedly covered in dirt, told cops the horse's hair was made of candy before admitting she had taken crystal meth.

Deputies responded to a 911 call on the evening of August 30 from a homeowner reporting a woman standing in her backyard who had taken her shirt off.

They arrived on the scene to find Teeple, dressed in blue jean shorts, no shoes and just a bra, in a fenced area in the yard with two miniature horses. 

Police said they asked Teeple where her shirt was and she looked down as though she did not know she wasn't wearing it, reported WLAF. 

The deputies found her shirt about 30 feet away and sat her down because she was allegedly unsteady on her feet. 

Teeple allegedly had dirt on her lips and inside her mouth and told the cops she didn't know where she was.

The homeowner told the cops Teeple had been eating grass and dirt and chewing on one of the horse's manes near its head. 

At this point, Teeple allegedly told the officers the mane was made of candy.

'The horse's hair is made of laffy taffy and air head candy,' she said, according to the police report. 

Teeple then admitted to taking methamphetamine the day before the incident, authorities said.   

Teeple was arrested and charged with public intoxication.
