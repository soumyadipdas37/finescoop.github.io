It comes after Vogue was forced to hit back at trolls last week after she was  body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss, six weeks after giving birth to her daughter Gigi.

The 34-year-old broadcaster garnered much adulation when she shared a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini for a tan tutorial on Instagram.

The star revealed that she had been subjected to some 'awful' comments for appearance. 

Insisting that she 'shouldn't be made to feel bad' for her own body, the mother-of-two shared a video of herself working out in a red top with black leggings.

Captioning the silent clip of the fitness session, the Irish beauty wrote: 'There is no secret! I got a lot of comments and mails about the video I posted the other day. Mainly positive but my god there were some awful ones!

'I hate the term 'snapping back' it's not something I aspire to do after having a child nor do I think it's important. My body is different to other people's, I didn't do anything specific.

'I've only recently started training again, 4 times a week for 45 minutes a session. I try to eat healthily but I have not cut calories and eat a lot more than usual as I'm breastfeeding and it's important to keep calories up so you have a good milk supply.

'I trained the whole way throughout my pregnancy and I think that is a factor in the way I look now. I'm also VERY tall so there's a lot more room for a baby.'

Revealing that she's been a fitness devotee for almost half her life, she continued: 'I've trained since I was 16, for me it's a great thing not only for my body but for my mind too.

'At the moment I feel permanently exhausted but training gives me energy and keeps my hormones under more control (they are still all over the place a little as with any new mother).'

Addressing the tanning video directly, she said: 'I didn't post that video to show off my body. I have always done tan tutorials, I don't feel the need to hide my body because as I've read 'it's unrealistic 6 weeks PP'.'

'What should a body look like after a baby?' Vogue challenged. 'There isn't a set way it should look. I don't want anyone to feel bad about their bodies and I certainly don't want to be made feel bad about my own. ❤️.'

She then revealed that the new video was taken during a fitness session with celebrity personal trainer Dalton Wong, 'focusing on the tush'. 

Despite having given birth less than two months ago, her abs, legs and arms all showed strong gym-crafted definition as she stood before the camera.

The seven-minute long clip started with her husband Spencer training the camera on his face as she stood behind him.

He soon stepped aside, with the help of a gentle playful nudge from his wife, as she unveiled herself in all of her bikini-clad glory.

As the video progressed, the Irish beauty was seen using products from her sunless tanning line, Bare by Vogue, which she applied to all areas of her skin. 

Captioning the video, the star wrote: 'This one is for all the new tanners and people who want to apply their tan better! @barebyvogue will give you a glow like you’re just back from holidays but application is key to looking bronzed.

'After some fake tan disasters in my life (a lot of them) I have finally mastered applying my tan... if you want any tips ask below and I’ll answer.' 

Vogue gave birth to Gigi Margaux on July 23 with husband Spencer, 33, and the couple welcomed their first child, son Theodore in September 2018.
