Rebecca Judd has revealed that her son Darcy, three, can't stop saying the swear word 'bast***' around the house. 

The 37-year-old WAG made the admission on Monday, on her KIIS FM radio show, the 3pm Pick Up.

Rebecca revealed that her son picked up the term from her, after she kept saying it while playing Mario Kart while in lockdown at her $7.3million Melbourne mansion amid the coronavirus pandemic.

'It's cute, but it's so wrong': Rebecca Judd revealed on her KIIS FM radio show on Monday the one swear word her son Darcy, three, can't stop saying

'He says it all the time. It's kind of cute, but it's so wrong,' Bec said on the show, with a laugh.

'My husband and I have been having some chats at home about what words warrant being a swear word or not. When I was a kid, every rude word was a swear word... even shut up,' Bec said. 

She said her four children, who she shares with AFL star husband Chris Judd, are now watching The Simpsons a lot, so have been saying some cheeky words at home.

But she said Darcy can't stop saying 'bast***' after hearing her fire up while playing Mario Kart. 

'I've been playing a lot of Mario Kart at home and since going to my friend Nicole Slater's house... she has this talking parrot that says, "oh you bast***, oh you bast***." 

'So now when someone bumps me when playing Mario Kart I say, "oh you bast***," Bec said.

'I've got this parrot in my head! So my youngest Darcy, one of my twins has picked up on the bast*** word and won't stop saying it!'

Bec then said that she wasn't sure if it is a swear word or not.

She added that she had a conversation with Darcy recently about what being a twin is, when he said he thought it was 'being a bast***.'

Bec's radio co-host Katie 'Monty' Dimond said she thought it was a bit full on that a three year old was swearing.   

'As cute as that sounds, hearing bast*** coming out of a kid's mouth is pretty full on isn't it?' Monty said.  

Rebecca and her husband, retired AFL star Chris Judd, have been in lockdown in Melbourne with their four children, son Oscar, nine, daughter Billie, six, and twins Tom and Darcy.

Last month, Rebecca admitted on her radio show that she's over the stage-four restrictions and can't wait to travel interstate for a holiday. 

It came after her twins trashed her stylish living room. 

'I'm done... I'm out,' Bec said.

Bec explained that she's been researching holiday destinations in Australia, tossing up the idea of Darwin, Perth, NSW, and Noosa. 

Melbourne has been under stage-four lockdown since August 2, following a spike in coronavirus cases in the state of Victoria.

Residents can only leave their homes for food and essential items, daily exercise, care for others, and work if they cannot work from home.
