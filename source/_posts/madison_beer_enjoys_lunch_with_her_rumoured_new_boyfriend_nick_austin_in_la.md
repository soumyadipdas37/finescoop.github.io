Nick was asked about their budding relationship on Wednesday but he shied away from any questions and said 'I don't know, I have no idea,' when asked about her current whereabouts. 

The social media star boasts over eight million followers on TikTok after joining the platform in November 2019.

He currently resides in a lavish Hollywood mansion named the Hype House, alongside fellow TikTok stars.
