Celebrity Juice began filming on a farm on Friday, as new captains Emily Atack and Laura Whitmore teased a first look at the show via Instagram.

The Love Island host, 35, and actress, 30, took to their social media to share snaps from a picturesque farm where they were shooting scenes with Keith Lemon for the programme's next season.

They kept a tight lip on exactly what they were filming, but appeared to be having a great time as the trio smiled for photos together.

One snap saw Emily, Laura and Keith pose for a fun selfie on the farmland, as Laura put on an animated display by flexing her muscles.

She put on a stylish display in an array of different outfits, as she teamed a white t-shirt with green dungarees in one photo, and in another she rocked white overalls. 

But that wasn't all as Laura also looked chic in a yellow plaid dress that she wore with a white top for an effortlessly chic look.

Emily also looked sensational in a grey plaid playsuit that she offset with a pair of brown knee-high boots for the day of farming.

Laura shared a video of herself walking along the green pastures, as she admitted she wasn't allowed  to show anything to her fans from filming except herself.

Meanwhile, Keith joked that he had recorded one of his videos earlier in the day but had no internet connection to post it, in case fans were confused because of how sunny it was at 7.30PM.

Earlier this month, Laura and Emily announced they'd be replacing Holly Willoughby as team captains on Celebrity Juice, four months after she left her 12-year stint.

ITV2's comedy panel series will see comedian Keith return to host eight episodes this autumn, followed by two 60-minute specials. 

In a cheery, socially-distanced snap, the funnyman joined his latest sidekicks as they toasted to their new jobs with glasses of champagne.

 Close: Laura, Keith and Emily didn't socially distance from each other during the shoot, presumably because they are in each other's bubble

The image was shared on their respective platforms, with Love Island's Laura writing: 'So excited to be the new team captain with my gal @emilyatackofficial All new @celebjuiceofficial coming this autumn. Dream job! Bring it on @keithlemon.' (sic)

'IT'S HAPPENING KIDS!!! New Celeb Juice coming soon. Cannot believe I'm team captain along side my wonderful pal @thewhitmore .. DREAM JOB OR WHAT EH!? Bring on the lols' (sic), an excited Emily penned.

Writer Keith, real name Leigh Francis, added: 'All new @celebjuiceofficial on t' telly Autumn on @itv2 with new team captains my pals @thewhitmore and @emilyatackofficial can't wait!' (sic)

End of the road: The last edition of Celebrity Juice, which aired from April until May, was fronted by both broadcaster Holly, 39, and Spice Girls' Mel B, 45

Centre stage: Laura and Emily have starred as guests on the much-loved show, but the series will mark the first time they will lead their star-studded teams (Emily pictured earlier this year)

The ladies have both starred as guests on the much-loved show, but the upcoming series will mark the first time they will battle it out with their star-studded teams, which are yet to be announced. 

Insisting she's not going down without a fight, TV star Emily said in a press release: 'Every time I've been on Juice in the past I've had such a good time, and now I'm doing it with two of my best mates and I'm a ruddy team captain!!! Can't believe it. 

'I dread to think what we're going to be faced with, but Whitmore should know that I won't be backing down and she is going to have some tough competition. But more importantly a wonderfully hilarious time. Bring it on!'

Her new opponent jokingly hit back: 'I can't wait to see what Keith has got lined up for Emily and I this series… From past experiences, nothing would surprise me. I cannot wait to get stuck in and lead my team to victory each week… I love you Emily, but watch out! I'm so excited to start!

'I've been the biggest fan for years, I used to go and sit in the audience when I first moved to London and can't believe I'm a team captain now!' 

The last edition, which aired from April until May, was fronted by both broadcaster Holly, 39, and Spice Girls' Mel B, 45.

Kelly Brook, Gino D'Acampo and Paddy McGuinness have also served as team captains in the past. 

The This Morning star launched the show with Keith and her BFF Fearne Cotton in 2008.

 

Farewell: In a sweet Instagram post, Holly thanked Celebrity Juice for 12 years of 'fantastic chaos' as she left just five months after former Top of the Pops star Fearne Cotton
