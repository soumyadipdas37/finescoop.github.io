Chloe Madeley has admitted it 'hurt' when she was accused of nepotism because she is the daughter of TV legends Richard and Judy.

The media personality, 33, told how people thought she got advancements in her career because of her family connections, which she feels she did.

Speaking to Radio Times, she said: 'I was accused of nepotism because I was Richard and Judy’s daughter. It was true, therefore it hurt. Now I’ve built up my own thing, I feel a lot stronger.'

Chloe got her start in TV as a roaming reporter on shows that her parents presented and later appeared as a contestant on Dancing on Ice in 2011.

She later became a contestant on The Jump and has also regularly appeared on the small screen for her work in the fitness industry. 

Chloe is married to rugby star James Haskell and the pair have created a new podcast called Couples Quarantine focusing on the challenges faced by couples who are now living and working at home.

The couple initially feared that the coronavirus lockdown would effect their work but have since found they have been busier than ever, with Chloe coaching private clients online.

Chloe has found that her usually forthright husband is sometimes reserved when speaking about what's going on in their lives on the show.

She said: 'When I’m honest, I’m really honest. Because of his time in rugby, James is good at being honest while holding something back and feeding the audience what they want to hear.'

With a lot of lockdown restrictions eased, Chloe isn't worried that their podcast will lose its relevance as many are going to continue to work from home.

She said: 'This will go on for a while. But the lives of lots of couples will stay as they are. There’s no longer a work domain and a home domain.'

She said: 'I was accused of nepotism because I was Richard and Judy’s daughter. It was true, therefore it hurt. Now I’ve built up my own thing, I feel a lot stronger'

The couple aren't worried about any criticism they may receive from putting themselves out there with James saying it's 'water off a duck's back'.    

Chloe, who married James in 2018, previously took to Instagram to reveal how they were coping during lockdown as she admitted that all relationships take 'hard work' to make it work.

She said: 'In the spirit of some VERY rare social media relationship honesty...

'NO relationship or marriage is perfect, it’s cliche AF, but it GENUINELY does take hard work to get things and keep things on the right track.

'To all the couples out there working through quarantine as a team and a solid family unit, I salute you! That calm, patient, push-pull balance is something to be very proud of.'

She sweetly added: 'I love you James, thank you for making me laugh my ass off every day.'
