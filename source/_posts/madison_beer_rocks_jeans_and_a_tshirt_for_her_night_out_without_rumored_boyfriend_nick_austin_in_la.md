Tour: Madison recently finished her virtual International tour across Europe, Australia and Canada the past few days 

Madison recently posted to Instagram that she had wrapped her International tour which occurred from the seventh to the tenth of September in the UK, Europe, Australia and Canada all via live stream.

The singer has been relishing in the success of her new singles Baby and Selfish from her upcoming album Life Support. 

She recently got candid about her Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis to magazine The Face and talked about how her mental struggles inspired her to make the album. 

'I was suicidal at one point. I was going through a really tough time, and I felt like making a break-up album amidst going through such real shit was dumbing myself down in a way that I didn’t want to do.

'Once I was given a diagnosis...I was getting more in touch with my emotions and figuring out how to be stable. I was able to write better and understand myself better. So I could just write the story how I wanted it to be told' she said.
