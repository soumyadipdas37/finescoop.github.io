Chadwick Boseman's high school in South Carolina is set to create a scholarship in his honour following his tragic death last week.

Principal Walter Mayfield at T. L. Hanna High School is believed to be creating a grant called the Chadwick Boseman Memorial Scholarship, which will be awarded to one student each year.

The Black Panther star sadly passed away from colon cancer aged 43 on Friday after fighting a secret battle.

The late actor reached milestones at the educational centre, where he played basketball for four years and wrote his first play, Crossroads. 

After graduating from T.L. Hanna in 1995, the screen star studied Directing at at Howard University in Washington, D.C.

Sharing details about the scholarship, Walter, who is reportedly in talks with Chadwick's family, told TMZ: 'The goal is to create a sustainable scholarship for years to come, and the school is aiming to raise $100k toward that end. 

'There's a bunch of people who have already reached out about contributing in Chadwick's honor - without even publicising the idea yet.'

Chadwick's former basketball coach, Wayne Jones, is also said to be encouraging the school to retire his old jersey number - 32 - in his memory.  

MailOnline has contacted a representative for T. L. Hanna High School for further comment.

His hometown of Anderson will also commemorate the late TV and film star with a ceremony at an outdoor amphitheater and screening of his film Black Panther this week.  

To take appropriate precautions with a public gathering amid the coronavirus pandemic, the amphitheater's capacity of 10,000 attendees will be reduced to 50 percent capacity in an effort to create social distancing space.

When Chadwick passed away at his home in LA, his family said in a heartbreaking statement: 'It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman. 

'Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV.

'A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much.'

The family revealed several of Boseman's recent films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, and August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, were filmed 'during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy.

'It was the honor of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther. The family thanks you for your love and prayers, and asks that you continue to respect their privacy during this difficult time.'

The thespian, who kept his diagnosis and personal life under wraps, is survived by his wife Taylor Simone Ledward and a parent, and had no children.
