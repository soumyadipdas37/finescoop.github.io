By mid-to-late August, you might be bored of your summer wardrobe but the last thing you want to do is spend a lot of money if the weather's likely to change soon.

But thankfully you don't have to wear your denim shorts yet another time or hope that your friends won't notice you've been wearing the same two summer dresses since May.

The FANCYINN floral print summer dress, which is earning rave reviews on Amazon, is super flattering and comes in a variety of colours and prints so you can find the perfect shade for you.

The FANCYINN summer dress, which costs just £18.99 on Amazon, is incredibly flattering and comes in a variety of colours and prints

Many reviewers comment that they cannot believe how good the quality is, considering that it costs just £18.99, with contented shoppers praising both the material and the cut, which stops just above the knee and emphasises the bust. 

One wrote: Love this dress! Loved it so much I ended up buying in another colour and style... Flows wonderfully! Comes with adjustable straps so you can get it to hit your natural waistline to complement your shape even more! I received a lot of compliments on this dress!!' 

Whether you have a small or large cleavage, the dress will enhance your assets because you can decide how much or how little to show off.

There's a hidden piece of fabric to tie around the center so that you can decide what looks best on you.

Contented shoppers who have bought the FANCYINN summer dress are praising both the material and the cut, which stops just above the knee and emphasizes the bust

Reviewers say that if you tie it securely, the dress is supportive enough for you to go bra-less.

One reviewer, who gave it a full five out of five stars, gushed: 'A beautiful dress, lovely fit and very flattering, especially if you are a slightly larger frame like myself!'

Another shopper wrote: 'It's so beautiful! I normally struggle to find things that fit my bust but this is perfect! So beautiful I cant wait to wear it on holidays.'

The FANCYINN dress is available in pastel colours like yellow, mint green and baby blue or bolder reds and navy blues, so the hardest decision is to work out what shade and print to buy first.
