Married At First Sight star Martha Kalifatidis stepped in to host The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday after host Jackie 'O' Henderson called in sick.

Jackie had taken the day off due to exhaustion, having pulled an all-nighter on Tuesday filming the finale of The Masked Singer followed by her KIIS FM breakfast show the next morning.

Martha was an eleventh-hour replacement after usual fill-on host Beau Ryan was unavailable.

Martha, 30, was one of breakout MAFS stars in 2019, and is still with her on-screen 'husband' Michael Brunelli, 28.

When the show began broadcasting at 6am, Kyle addressed Jackie's absence and introduced Martha to listeners.

'Jackie is not here today, so Martha has come in,' he said, adding: 'Jackie did an all nighter yesterday, she did this show then the puppet show [Masked Singer]. She's crashed.'

It was confirmed that Jackie is not ill, but just taking the day off to rest up. She is due to return to work on Friday.

Martha sounded sympathetic towards Jackie, saying: 'I heard her, actually, yesterday, and she didn't sound good.'

Kyle then joked that he would 'be nice' to Martha: 'You're going to hold our hand, we're going to hold your hand, and we're going to get through this show.'

The reality TV star said she was called by one of the show's producers at 5:30am, just half an hour before the show was due to go live.

Martha said her boyfriend Michael encouraged her to accept the last-minute offer to co-host the popular radio show: 'He said "Oh my God, you have to do it, are you nuts?"'  

She'll be back soon! It was confirmed that Jackie was not ill, but instead taking the day off to rest up. She is due to return to work on Friday

On the road? Former NRL star Beau Ryan (pictred) is known to fill in regularly for Kyle when he's unable to co-host with Jackie, but it's believed he was unavailable due to filming commitments for Seven's The Amazing Race

Former NRL star Beau Ryan is known to fill in regularly for Kyle when he's unable to co-host with Jackie.

It's believed he was unable to be a guest host on the show in the instance as production is likely to have already commenced for Seven's The Amazing Race.

He told Daily Mail Australia at a Stan event in August that the cast and crew were 'going soon' to begin the localised series around Australia amid the coronavirus pandemic.
