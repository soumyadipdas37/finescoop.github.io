With Halloween 2020 less than two months away, many Americans are beginning to plan topical outfits to celebrate the occasion.  

And while the year has brought no shortage of newly famous figures - from Tiger King's Carole Baskin to White House Coronavirus Task Force Doctor Anthony Fauci - it seems that many will simply be dressing up as a nondescript suburban white woman. 

According to an article published in Vice on Wednesday, 'Karen' costumes are set to be the most popular Halloween outfits of 2020. 

'Karen' has recently become used as a slang term for a white woman who is perceived to be entitled, demanding or racist. 

This year, dozens of videos showing 'Karens' calling cops on black people and screaming at supermarket clerks when asked to wear a face mask have gone viral on the internet. 

According to an article published in Vice on Wednesday, 'Karen' costumes are set to be the most popular Halloween outfits of 2020.  Los Angeles-based artist Jason Adcock has started selling custom-made Karen facemasks on his Etsy page for the price of $180 (pictured)

'The scariest thing you can be on Halloween!!!!' Adcock's custom-made masks feature Karen's face contorted into a fit of rage, with yellowing teeth, red eyes and blotchy skin

Los Angeles-based artist Jason Adcock has started selling custom-made Karen facemasks on his Etsy page for the price of $180. 

The product description reads: 'The scariest thing you can be on Halloween!!!! Full head latex mask with hair.  Sculpted, molded, cast, and painted.'

The masks feature Karen's face contorted into a fit of rage, with yellowing teeth, red eyes and blotchy skin. 

'I was quarantining at home and wanted to make a new mask. I just started sculpting, and out came Karen,' Adcock told Vice about how he came up with the idea for the masks. 

'I've spent most of my life working retail in the cosmetics industry, so I have seen countless Karens in their natural habitat.' 

One Etsy store is stocking  a blonde, asymmetrical style wig known for being the stereotypical Karen hairstyle

One Amazon retailer is selling a 'I Want To Speak To The Manager' sweatshirt for those looking to complete their Karen costumes 

Last year, YouTube star Sierra Schultz won praise for dressing up as a Karen, complete with a similar blonde wig and 2000s-style sunglasses

Adcock says he has received some hate mail over his controversial creations. 

'I have gotten a few death threats, a lot of people saying it's racist, or that I should be disgusted with myself,' he stated. 

'But if the one thing you're pressed up about right now is a rubber Halloween mask of an angry lady, you need to wake up!' 

Each mask takes up to four weeks to complete, so those hoping to wear one on October 31 will have to place their order soon. 

However, there are a number of other retailers selling items to transform party-goers into a Karen.

Amazon is selling COVID-19 costumes, with masks supposed to replicate the actual virus

The masks have been made amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which is still claiming thousands of American lives

While dressing up as a Karen may be one hot option, there are also a number of other topical choices for Halloween 2020.

Elsewhere, Yandy has created 'sexy' Carole Baskin and Joe Exotic outfits for those wanting to dress up as the stars of this year's biggest show, Tiger King. 

It;'s likely that thousands of Americans will also dress up as White House Coronavirus Task Force Doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. 

Dr. Fauci has become known as much for his signature eyeglasses, while Dr. Birx is famous for her array of silk scarves, meaning the medics will be easy to imitate on October 31.
