Kristin Cavallari announced her divorce from Jay Cutler, after seven-years of marriage, back in April.  

And now the 33-year-old reality TV star appears to be navigating her post-split life with a sense of humor and the support of her longtime hairstylist Justin Anderson. 

'Longest relationship of my life,' the bombshell captioned a snap of herself on Friday with Anderson, who recently became engaged to his partner Austin Rhodes.

As they shared a chair, Anderson wrapped one arm around the star's waist, as she smoldered at the camera under an oversized pair of black sunglasses.  

Additionally on her Instagram Story, she joked to her more than four million followers that the dpHUE co-founder was her 'boyfriend for the weekend.' 

Meanwhile, Anderson cheekily wrote that Cavallari 'tried to say she wasn’t in the mood for a picture,' before she posed up a storm with one hand on top of her white fedora.

The pair's poolside snaps captured the E! star's sensational figure, as she sported a tiny black bikini, which showcased the results of her doing 'keto all week.' 

While the stunner has always maintained an incredibly fit figure, seven days of the low-carb, high-fat keto appeared to further enhance her already taut midriff. 

Anderson affectionately referred to his platonic friend as his 'baby' before sharing a snap with another pal on his Instagram Story with the caption 'the squad shows up for each other.'

Her getaway comes within a day of her NFL ex, 37, diffusing the romance rumors between him and conservative pundit Tomi Lahren. 

Romance rumors first got traction after the pair was seen 'enjoying a nice night out together at Winners Bar in Nashville on Friday,' an insider told E! News. 

Spring split: Cutler, who is father to three children - sons Camden, eight, and Jaxon, six; and daughter Saylor, four - with the Very Cavallari beauty, 33, who he split with in April. They were snapped in Chicago last year 

But other sources say that Jay and Tomi - who are both recently single - are nothing more than friends, noting the pair were not alone during the supposed 'date.'

Another source told E!: 'The two of them were having a lot of fun together at a table along with two other friends. Tomi and Jay were passing a bottle of tequila back and forth and taking shots together directly from the bottle.'

'The two of them left together,' the insider went on, still leaving are they/aren't they question up in the air.

Cutler and Cavallari announced their split this past April, saying in a joint statement that their parting was 'the situation of two people growing apart.'

'With great sadness, after 10 years together we have come to a loving conclusion to get a divorce,' Cutler and Cavallari said. 'We have nothing but love and respect for one another and are deeply grateful for the years shared, memories made, and the children we are so proud of.' 

The pair share sons Camden, eight, and Jaxon, six and four-year-old daughter, Saylor.
