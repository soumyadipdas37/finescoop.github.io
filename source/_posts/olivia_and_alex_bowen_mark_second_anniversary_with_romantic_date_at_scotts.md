When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.

'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.

'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.

'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.'
