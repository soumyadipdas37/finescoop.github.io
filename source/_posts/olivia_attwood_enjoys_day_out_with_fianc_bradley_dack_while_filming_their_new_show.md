Olivia previously had her own reality show with ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes called Crackin' On.

However, their relationship took a turn for the worse when Chris, 27, broke up with her on camera, telling her the relationship wasn't making him happy anymore.

He said to her at the time: 'I love you, I always will. You know that, nothing doubts that. You can't kid yourself.'

Olivia then reunited with Bradley, whom she was with before Love Island, while Chris found love with his now ex-girlfriend Jesy Nelson.
