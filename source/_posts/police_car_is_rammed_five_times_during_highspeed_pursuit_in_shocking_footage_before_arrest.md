This is the shocking moment a police car was rammed five times during a high-speed pursuit before four officers pinned down the driver in a dramatic arrest. 

Footage filmed from a police patrol car in Fermanagh, Northern Ireland shows a black Vauxhall Insignia repeatedly slamming into its rear bumper as the officer inside urgently radios for help. 

The policeman is heard shouting: 'I've been rammed five times coming in the Belfast road!'. 

The car then overtakes the patrol vehicle and speeds into the nearby town of Enniskillen. 

There, a separate video shows at least four officers pinning down the driver in the street. Two of them suffered 'minor injuries' in the lead up to the arrest.

The dramatic series of events began when the Vauxhall crashed into a car driven by another member of the public in Lisnaskea, 11 miles from Enniskillen. 

The police car was trying to stop the Vauxhall after the first crash when the driver moved behind them and rammed into its rear, MailOnline understands. 

The Vauxhall driver then drove into Eniskillen and got out of the car and threw a cone at an officer before he was arrested. 

It is not clear who filmed both videos.  

Inspector Brown, from the Police Service for Northern Ireland, said: 'Shortly after 4:05 pm today (Wednesday, 30 September) police received reports of an assault and disturbance in the East Bridge Street area of Enniskillen.

'A man has since been arrested and is currently in custody assisting police with their enquiries in relation to the incident. During the arrest an officer received minor injuries for which no hospital treatment was required.

'The incident is being linked to two earlier road traffic collisions which both occurred at around 11am this morning. The first incident occurred on the Moorlough Road area of Lisnaskea and involved two vehicles, one of which was a black Vauxhall Insignia. The second incident occurred at the Belfast Road area of Enniskillen, in which a police vehicle was rammed by the black Vauxhall Insignia. Two police officers received minor injuries following the incident.

'Enquiries are continuing, and police would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident, is asked to contact police on 101, quoting reference number 1286 30/09/20.'
