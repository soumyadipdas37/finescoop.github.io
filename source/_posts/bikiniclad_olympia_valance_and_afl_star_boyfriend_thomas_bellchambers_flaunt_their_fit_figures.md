They've been travelling around Queensland in a motorhome and are now enjoying a break at Orpheus Island. 

And on Wednesday, Olympia Valance and AFL star boyfriend Thomas Bellchambers enjoyed a day trip to Hinchinbrook Island. 

The couple, who recently celebrated their one-year anniversary, showed off their fit figures as they went for a hike and went swimming in a gorgeous waterfall.

Former Neighbours star Olympia, 27, looked flawless as she went makeup free and stripped off into red high-waisted briefs and a black crop top. 

Thomas meanwhile flaunted his buff physique in a pair of budgy smugglers.

'Absolute heaven,' Olympia captioned one post.

Olympia, who is the younger sister of Holly Candy, added underneath a shot of her and Thomas: 'Happy little Vegemite.'

'Just try and wipe the smile off my face,' she captioned another post. 

The pair have been enjoying life on the road recently, travelling around Queensland in a motorhome. 

'Life on the road with my man,' Olympia captioned one post showing them enjoying breakfast by the beach.

Thomas, 31, had to relocate from Melbourne to Queensland and spend time at the AFL hub. 

But earlier this month, the Essendon star announced his retirement from the game. 

At the time, Olympia wrote a gushing post dedicated to her man, writing: 'You are the most humble, down to earth and loyal man I have ever met.'

'I mean this on a personal level, but very much on a professional level too.' 

She added in part of her post: 'Congratulations on an incredibly successful career my big boy.'
