Talk about making a towering first impression.

The Weeknd opened the MTV VMAs in New York City with a performance of his hit song - Blinding Lights - on the rooftop of the Edge, which is the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere. 

The Canada-born star came into the night with six nominations including Artist Of The Year, and five for the song's video: Video Of The Year, Best R&B, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Direction by Anton Tammi. 

High-flying: The Weeknd opened the 2020 MTV VMAs in New York City with a rooftop performance of his hit song Blinding Lights

Looking bloodied and bruised to match the cover of his latest studio album After Hours, the hitmaker kicked things off seemingly passed-out, laying on the ground in a pre-recorded clip.

As the intro to the song progressed, The Weeknd stood up to reveal his 1980s-era ensemble of black pants, red blazer and black shirt and tie.

The impressive visual effect included an array of light towers and images of subway cars behind him.

Cinematic: The singer-songwriter, 30, performed atop the Edge at Hudson Yards, which is the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere

Battered: The Canadian crooner looked bloodied and bruised to match the cover of his latest studio album After Hours, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200

Then, just as he went in to the catchy chorus, the shot switched to the singer-songwriter atop the Edge at Hudson Yards. 

'I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights -- No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch,' he sang with the lights of New York City shining all around him

'I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night -- Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust -- Hey, hey, hey.'

With the help of a helicopter flying high above the streets of the Big Apple, the cameras circled the Starboy's every move as he delivered his performance on a bright triangle platform.

Dramatic: A helicopter flew high above the streets of the Big Apple, and circled the Starboy's every move

Acclaimed: The Weeknd came into the night with six MTV VMA nominations

As the song reached the climax after the final chorus, The Weeknd (born Abel Makkonen Tesfaye) yelled out: 'New York City', which was met with a massive fireworks show that showered the skyline.  

Blinding Lights is his fifth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100.

After Hours, which has been described as an artistic reinvention for the artist, was released on March 20 and immediately shot to the top of the Billboard 200.                  

With the help of the other two singles --  Heartless and In Your Eyes -- it stayed at number one for four consecutive weeks.
