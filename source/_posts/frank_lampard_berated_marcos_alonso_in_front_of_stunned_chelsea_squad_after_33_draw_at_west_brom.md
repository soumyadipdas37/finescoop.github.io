Chelsea boss Frank Lampard savaged defender Marcos Alonso in front of his team-mates after his side's 3-3 draw at West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday, according to reports.

Alonso is said to have attempted to watch the second half of the match on the team coach rather than with the Chelsea substitutes inside The Hawthorns, infuriating his manager after he tried to leave the stadium without permission.

The left-back was directly at fault for two of the hosts' goals in a defensive disaster for Chelsea in the opening 45 minutes that left them 3-0 down at the break.

He is understood to have taken a shower and gone to the bus after being hauled off alongside midfielder Mateo Kovacic, who took his place in the stands with the rest of the squad. 

Alonso reappeared in a different area from the group shortly into the half, with his actions coming as a surprise at a time when strict COVID-19 protocols are in place at stadiums.

Lampard was 'the angriest they've ever seen him' at Alonso during a tirade in front of the squad after praising his players' spirited second-half comeback, according to The Athletic.

The outlet quoted an insider as revealing: 'The players were saying they have never seen the manager like this.

'It kicked off after the game and he was going mad at Alonso. Some were talking about how they'd be surprised if he plays for Chelsea ever again.'

The Spain international compounded his own misery after gifting Matheus Pereira possession in the build-up to Callum Robinson's surprise opener and losing Kyle Bartley for West Brom's third goal. 

Lampard singled out Alonso and new signing Thiago Silva, whose slip led to the Baggies' second goal, in his post-match interview.

He admitted to Sky Sports: 'They were clear mistakes. The first one, Marcos heads it into the middle of the pitch for them for a transition.

'Thiago's one is a mistake. He's been around long enough to know that and we will certainly give him that one in his first game.

'And then Marcos loses his man for the third goal from the corner – a clear mistake.' 

Alonso has started Chelsea's first three Premier League games in the absence of new £50million signing Ben Chilwell through injury.

His replacement by Cesar Azpilicueta and subsequent misdemeanour could see him leave Stamford Bridge two years before the end of his contract.

Chelsea would have until the end of the transfer window on October 5 to make any immediate move to ship out Alonso, who has won the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League since joining from Fiorentina in 2016.
