Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson shocked his fans last week when he revealed that his entire family had tested positive for COVID-19.

Luckily, everyone in the house had already recovered by the time the 48-year-old actor and former wrestler made the announcement.

Now, sources close to Johnson have opened up to People about his family's paramount importance in his life.

Number one: Following his entire family's brush with COVID-19, a source close to Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson said that his 'family is his biggest priority' in an interview with People from Wednesday; shown in December

'He absolutely loves his girls. They live out of the spotlight so his girls can have a normal childhood,' the insider said of The Rock. 'His family is his biggest priority.' 

Johnson and his wife Lauren Hashian, 36, share two daughters, Jasmine, four, and Tiana, two.

His oldest daughter, Simone, 19, reportedly wasn't infect. He shares her with his ex-wife and current business partner Dany Garcia, 51.

'He is a huge family man,' the source continued, while adding that he's also an intensely private person who is laser-focused on his family and his work.

The Fast & Furious franchise star announced the news that his family had contracted the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, September 2, in a nearly 12-minute Instagram video.

Health scare: 'We are counting our blessings right now. We are well aware you don’t always get to the other end of COVID-19 stronger and healthier,' he said

'Testing positive for COVID-19 is a lot different than recovering from nasty injuries, getting evicted or being broke, which I've been more than a few times,' he began. 

'My No. 1 priority is to always protect my family and my loved ones... I wish it was only me that tested positive. It was my entire family and it was a kick in the gut. We in a family are good, we're on the other end of it and no longer contagious. Thank God, we're healthy.'

He added, 'We are counting our blessings right now. We are well aware you don’t always get to the other end of COVID-19 stronger and healthier.' 

'I have had some of my best friends lose their parents to this virus that is so incredibly relentless and unforgiving. We are counting our blessings, but we are good.'

B-day girl: He was back to celebrating his family on Tuesday, when he shared a fun black and white portrait of himself and his wife Lauren Hashian to celebrate her 36th birthday

Dwayne and his wife Lauren were both hit considerably harder by the coronavirus than their daughters, though everyone seems to have made a full recovery.

He was back to celebrating his family on Tuesday, when he shared a fun black and white portrait of himself and the singer and record producer to celebrate her 36th birthday. 

The two stood in front of a mixing board in a music studio, and he wore a black tank top and shorts with tights and white trainers, while she wore a gray graphic T-shirt, black leggings and white sneakers.

'She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean - she was the best damn woman that I ever seen,' he began by quoting AC/DC's You Shook Me All Night Long.

'HAPPIEST OF BIRTHDAYS to my one of a kind woman @laurenhashianofficial who holds it all down and makes our “big engine” run - with a beautiful and inspiring quality, a sweet harmony & a lotta love ❤️.

'I’m a grateful man,' he concluded, before adding that the tequila was on him. 

Going strong: Dwayne and Lauren tied the knot in August 2019 in Hawaii, but they've dated since 2007, shortly after he and his first wife Dany Garcia, 51, separated; shown in 2017
