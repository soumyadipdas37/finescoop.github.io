Juventus are reportedly in contact with Federico Chiesa’s agent to negotiate a deal for the Fiorentina forward.  

The Bianconeri are said to be preparing a £45million offer that could see the Italy international relocate to Turin for the next five years.

However, the two parties are yet to agree terms as Fiorentina are allegedly holding out for their £64m asking price.

The Old Lady have added an obligation to buy next summer in a bid to convince the Viola to accept the loan deal, according to Correire.

Having delivered seven goals for Fiorentina last season, Andrea Pirlo is the keen to secure the 22-year-old's signature amid growing interest from AC Milan.

 Chiesa has already scored one goal and registered one assist for Fiorentina this season

Chiesa - the son of former Italy striker Enrico - is rated as one of Italy's best young prospects and will be an integral part of their squad for next summer's European Championship. 

Since breaking into the first team in 2016, Chiesa has been a hit for La Viola and has already scored one goal and registered one assist during the clubs first two games of the 2020-2021 season. 

Fiorentina are unlikely to let their star player depart from the Artemio Franchi for a discounted price given he is under contract until June 2022.
