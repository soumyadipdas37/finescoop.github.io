Kelis has welcomed her third child.

The Milkshake hitmaker, 40, took to Instagram on Saturday to share the exciting news with her fans as she revealed she'd welcomed a baby girl following an 'intense' labour.

Kelis' announcement came just over a month after she announced she was expected her third child, as she joking said she needed a 'table for 5.'

In the video Kelis told her fans: 'Hey, so I've been kind of MIA...but for a really good reason cause I just had my baby.

"And it was intense. I've been doing a lot of thinking and I'm generally a really private person, with my personal life, but I wanted to kind of bring my fam in to sort of talk about all of these women's things we go through that no one really tells us about.

'So I had my baby a week ago and I had a girl by the way - so very excited about that - it's my first girl! I wanted to bring you into my process.'

In August Kelis announced that she was expecting her third child, in an Instagram post to promote a home pregnancy test brand.

'Chef Kelis - table for 5 please. We’re adding one more!' wrote the singer, songwriter and chef in the caption.

The Harlem-born artist continued, 'Happy to announce that I’m expecting and I’m partnering with @firstresponsepregnancy, as they are committed to supporting healthy, equitable pregnancy journeys and understand the importance of a nurturing environment for black women and mothers.' 

Later in the caption, Kelis -whose full name is Kelis Rogers- cited her concerns that 'we still live in a country where Black women historically have had the highest maternal mortality rates.' 

The Grammy-nominated singer has two sons: Knight, eleven, with ex Nas, and Shepherd, four, with husband Mike Mora.
