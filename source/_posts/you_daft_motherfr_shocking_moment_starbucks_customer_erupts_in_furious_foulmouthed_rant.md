A Starbucks customer has been caught erupting into a furious foul-mouthed rant after a server 'spilled coffee on him'.

The driver got out of his car at a drive-thru in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, before repeatedly calling a female staffer a 'sl*t'.

Footage of the verbal attack was posted to social media on Wednesday with viewers slamming the man's response to allegedly having coffee spilled on him.

The clip, which is a minute-and-a-half long, was taken by the driver's passenger and showed him ranting at a Starbucks worker while standing outside of his car.

The driver (pictured left) got out of his car at a drive-thru in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, before repeatedly calling a female staffer a 'sl*t'

The worker calmly leaned against the drive-thru's window frame as he listened to the customer's vicious tirade of foul-language and insults. 

The customer shouts: 'I bought a coffee. She was holding it from the top. She splashed the lid. You daft motherf***er.'

The worker quickly interrupted him with 'there's no need to swear' but it did little to stem the angry customer's rant.

The man added: 'She splashed the lid and it's burnt my hand. Do you understand.;

The worker calmly leaned against the drive-thru's window frame as he listened to the customer's vicious tirade of foul-language and insults

The worker continued to explain that he would 'sort it', but the customer was not appeased.

'You understand you daft motherf***er. It burned my hand,' he said. 'That's not no hire car that's cash paid. Tell that s**t it's cash paid.'

The worker said: 'Alright but no swearing. We'll sort this out.'

The customer shouted louder, saying: 'You've burned my f***ing hand. You understand. You're telling me it's my f***ing fault. You're serving me. You've handed the coffee out. You've burned my f***ing hand. Are you f***ing listening.'

The employee said: 'I haven't burned your hand. I'm just trying to sort it out but then you're calling me a fat f**k.'

The female staff member - thought to be the object of his fury - then appeared at the window and shouted something inaudible at the man

Pointing to his car the man said: 'Too right we're going to sort this out. Look at what she's done. You're going to pay for that as well. It's not a hire car it's cash paid.'  

The female staff member - thought to be the object of his fury - then appeared at the window and shouted something inaudible at the man. 

The driver continued to call her a 'sl**' before getting into his car and slamming the door. 

The woman tried to argue back and he said: 'Come here you little sl**.' 

The manager then told the man to drive 'around the front' of the shop where they could solve the issue out of the way of other customers. 

The clip, which is a minute-and-a-half long, was taken by the driver's passenger and showed him ranting at a Starbucks worker

He said: 'This is a f***ing hundred grand motor. Are you going to pay me. I'm going around front.' 

The explosive scene was shared on Facebook yesterday by user Sian Banham who called the man's actions 'vile.' 

Her thoughts were echoed by hundreds of other people. Julie Kearney wrote: 'Pure d***, accidents happen.' 

'Should have jumped the counter and nutted him.' Donna Morgan added: 'The first time he swore and called her slag those windows would have been closed. 

'He was so aggressive I actually would have called the police.

Wayne Hills wrote: 'God he had patience I would have knocked him out rude t***.'
