The highly-anticipated Bachelor finale is set to take place this week. 

And now Locky Gilbert has landed in Sydney. 

The 31-year-old tour adventure guide, who hails from Perth but is based in Bali, appeared on Studio 10 on Tuesday when he said he can't wait for the finale to air, so he can publicly declare his love for the winner.  

The countdown is on! Locky Gilbert has jetted into Sydney ahead of The Bachelor finale - and revealed live on Studio 10 on Tuesday that he can't want to tell everyone how 'in love' he is

'It's been so hard, because everyone's first question is, "who'd you pick? Who'd you pick? Who'd you pick?" And you have to keep it a secret,' Locky said.

'So to be able to tell everyone how in love I am, it's going to be amazing.'

The former Survivor star added that he hasn't even told his mother who wins his heart on the show.

'My mum still doesn't know who I pick,' Locky said.

'I told ya, I keep it a secret. I want to tell everyone and tell my mum who I'm in love with.' 

As of Tuesday, Irena Srbinovska is the bookies' favourite to win ($1.27), Bella Varelis is tipped for runner-up ($3.50) and intruder Bec Cvilikas is expected to place third ($7.50).

On Monday, as Locky Gilbert's top four contestants do the media rounds ahead of the last two episodes, Bella made a rather cutting remark to TV Week.

The 25-year-old marketing consultant gleefully told the magazine that she and Locky, 31, had said 'I love you' to each other during lockdown.

Given her fierce rivalry with Irena, it's likely this admission was directed at the 31-year-old nurse - who told Locky on the show last week she was 'completely in love' with him, but he couldn't say 'I love you' in return.

For context, on-site production of The Bachelor was suspended from mid-March until the first week of July, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

During this three-and-a-half-month period, Locky kept in touch with the women via Zoom, text messaging and FaceTime - and it was about this time that Bella and Locky supposedly said they loved each other 'in texts'.

However, Bella hastened to add they did so using emojis, not actual words. 

She explained: 'We've both said, "love heart emoji you" in texts, but not the full sentence yet. Those three words mean a lot to me and Locky knows that, so it's not something I take lightly.'

Bella added: 'There were months between filming, and Locky and I would FaceTime for hours a day. We just enjoyed each other's virtual company.'

The Bachelor finale begins on Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10.
