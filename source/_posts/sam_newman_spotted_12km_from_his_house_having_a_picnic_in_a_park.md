Anti-lockdown activist Sam Newman has been spotted having a picnic with AFL legend Don Scott and two mates while out and about in locked-down Melbourne.

The controversial commentator was photographed more than 12km from his home in Docklands eating with the trio in Brighton, in the city's south, on Tuesday.

Newman had just two days earlier taken another swipe at Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews for banning golf during the Stage Four lockdown.

The ex-AFL Footy Show host claimed he had a 'perfectly legitimate reason' for meeting three people for lunch across town from his house, but refused to say what it was. 

Under current lockdown restrictions, Melburnians can only meet in groups of five, from up to two households, for two hours of exercise but not for socialising.

He was seen grabbing sushi from The Pantry on Church Street while not wearing a mask, instead pulling his turtleneck skivvy over his mouth - which does not meet the new mask requirements

He was seen grabbing sushi from The Pantry on Church Street before driving in a vintage 1960s Ford Mustang GT convertible to a nearby park with a friend.

At the park they met with two others including AFL legend Don Scott, with whom he hosts the weekly You Cannot Be Serious podcast.

Newman was not wearing a mask, instead pulling his turtleneck skivvy over his mouth, but leaving his nose uncovered. Scott wasn't wearing a mask at all.

New health directives in effect across Victoria from Monday banned scarves, bandannas, and other clothing being used instead of a proper fitted mask.

Newman also wore cotton gloves with the fingertips cut off, along with shorts and sneakers, while his other two pals donned somewhat more formal attire and standard surgical masks.

The group stretched out on the grass as they ate heir sushi and chatted in the sun.

As well as the ban on socialising, Melburnians must all be within 5km from their homes - or workplaces if their job is on the a very short list of businesses allowed to operate during Stage Four.

Newman angrily defended his actions in a long tirade when contacted by Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday morning, but refused to say what exemptions he was utilising.

'I had a perfectly legitimate reason to be there and I don't have to explain myself to you or anyone else,' he said.

Newman did not take the only slight loosening of restrictions on Sunday very well as they still banned his beloved sport of golf but allowed outdoor swimming pools to open.

'Andrews has become Victoria's dopey Joe Biden. To say communal swimming is ok (because it doesn't require a facility), but golf is not, shows the IQ required of an elected official,' he wrote on Twitter.

'Unwittingly, he has given consent for sedition.'

Two weeks earlier he called for manslaughter charges to be laid against Mr Andrews over his handling of the pandemic, and the hotel quarantine bungle blamed for 18,000 infections and 768 deaths.

Newman was visited by police in August and warned over comments that could be interpreted as incitement, a crime for which half a dozen protest organisers were charged with that week. 

'Of all the protests that we have put up with, how about 1/4 million of us gather in the CBD to take the City/State back, before EVERY previous march will have been pointless. And hopefully a State day of coordination. Any takers,' he wrote.

Newman later walked back his comments, claiming he wasn't advocating for mass protest but merely partaking in a bit of hyperbole to draw attention to the issue.

'I didn't encourage a quarter of a million people to march through the street,' he told Sunrise.

'I said wouldn't it be great to have 250,000 people wandering through the city - I don't encourage people to do that but it was just a sign that this government should cautiously reopen business enterprises in the city before it rusts over.

'I am not asking people to come from all over Victoria to protest. I'm not trying to get the police involved in this.'

'If they want to arrest me and put me in jail for this, that is fine. But I am not suggesting it. I never did in the first place.'

Newman later addressed his tweet on his weekly You Cannot Be Serious podcast, where he came under fire from co-hosts who labelled him 'irresponsible'. 

'All I was trying to do was get enough people to get attention… I'm not advocating for people to come from all over Victoria to march up the city,' he said.

'I'm not advocating a rally as such. I just said wouldn't it be great that 250,000 people would march in the city. That is hyperbole, that is designed to get the attention of the government cautiously reopening business.'
