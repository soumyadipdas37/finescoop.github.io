Home and Away star Sam Frost has spoken about her struggles with body image.  

The 31-year-old revealed body image is something she has 'battled' with her entire life while speaking to The Daily Telegraph on Monday.

Sam said of the struggle: 'I'd like to say I feel comfortable in my body, but the truth is body image is something that I've battled with my whole life,' she said.

The blonde bombshell continued : 'I don't want to be like that.' 

'I'm trying to get more comfortable in my own skin, and I'm trying really hard to push away those insecurities,' she finished. 

The comments come after Sam recently courted attention by uploading two Instagram posts of herself modelling a tiny striped bikini.

But it was her noticeably fuller-looking bust that really caught the eye.

In one photo, a very bronzed Sam proudly displayed her svelte frame and prodigious cleavage while posing for a mirror selfie.  

Sam also uploaded another photo of her ample assets as she lay on her back while positioning the camera above her body.

However, Sam quickly deleted both images.

The following day, Sam uploaded an essay to her website explaining that she decided to delete the posts after receiving backlash from online trolls.

'It was just easier to [delete the photos], than deal with people's judgment about my body or their opinions about what I should or shouldn't be posting,' she lamented 

In the essay, the blonde shared details of her decade-long battle with body confidence.

'I spent my twenties hiding under a black cap, wearing baggy clothes,' she wrote.

'I was wearing clothes like that because I felt extremely insecure about my body. I felt ashamed and uncomfortable,' Sam continued.
