She continues to revel in the delights of first-time motherhood, after welcoming her daughter Dusty with husband Matt Kay in July last year.

And Lacey Turner was spotted making the most of some brief solo time recently, when she took a break from shooting her BBC soap EastEnders to run errands.

The 32-year-old actress looked delightful in a floral long-sleeved maxi dress as she stepped out in London to grab coffee while getting her Land Rover cleaned.

Teaming her eye-catching gown of choice with the pair of black flat sandals, the screen star donned sunglasses, while she wore her blown locks in a sleek blowout.

Keeping a tight hold of her trusty smartphone, the mother-of-one appeared to be in an upbeat mood as she strolled along the streets of the English capital.

On Bank Holiday Monday, she was seen enjoying a family day out with her husband Matt and their adorable offspring, as they dined at Pizza Express.

The soap star recently celebrated the birthday of her childhood sweetheart, Matt, who she married in 2017 at an intimate Ibiza ceremony.

Taking to Instagram, the actress shared a series of sweet snaps while adding the caption: 'Happy birthday my love!

'Thank you for being our best friend, the best husband and best daddy in the whole wide. We love you forever & ever'. 

Appearing on Loose Women, the EastEnders star reflected on her journey to motherhood after welcoming daughter Dusty in July with Matt.  

Lacey revealed: 'It took us ages to get pregnant. I put so much pressure on myself to fall pregnant and it wasn't happening.

The actress tragically suffered from two miscarriages and had begun to give up hope. 

She refused to acknowledge her third pregnancy until she was 14 weeks along, and even then she would not allow herself to get excited until she reached the 25 week mark. 

She added: 'It got to the point where I said to Matt, "Let's just forget it. We'll get a puppy." As soon as we'd said that, we fell pregnant.' 

Revealing she had a scan 'every week' during her pregnancy with Dusty, she explained: 'I was so scared. Until you feel kicking, you don't know if anything is actually there.

'I always thought, "This might not work," I just became really laid back about the whole thing. I just felt numb to the whole thing.' 

She had to change her way of thinking following the devastating disappointment of her first miscarriage as she recalled: 'You start thinking about baby names and looking at clothes and things, and then it was just sort of gone… at seven weeks.  

'It was such a massive shock as quite naively I thought, "I'm going to have a baby"... It's so hard, what do you say to people?

'I don't want them to feel uncomfortable about it. Although I felt so heartbroken, I just thought "I'll brush that under the rug"…

'It's hard because, are you supposed to grieve for something that's the size of a grain of rice? People believe different things, but for me it was a baby from the minute it was conceived.'

Soap: Lacey is best known for her role as Stacey Slater in long-running BBC soap EastEnders
