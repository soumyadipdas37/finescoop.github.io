Gregg used to weigh 16 stone before embarking on a new exercise and healthy eating regime that allowed him to drop a whopping four stone.

He revealed to The Mirror: 'I’ve got more energy and stamina and I’m stronger and leaner than I was at 25.'

Gregg also said he received a big wake up call when he was informed he had dangerously high cholesterol.

He enrolled the help of a personal trainer and now exercises for an hour, five days a week from his Kent farmhouse, as gyms remain closed.
