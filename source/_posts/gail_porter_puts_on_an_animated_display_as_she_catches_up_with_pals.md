Gail complemented her afternoon attire with a pair of denim cut-off shorts, rainbow-detailed tube socks and Nike high-tops. 

The Fully Booked host accessorised her casual look with several necklaces, rings and a pair of aviator-style shades.  

In June, an emotional Gail branded late Prodigy star Keith Flint the love of her life.

The TV star dated Keith between 1999 and 2000. He who was found dead aged 49, at his home on March 4, 2019.

Gail discussed the romance with Louis Theroux, 50, for his BBC Sounds podcast Grounded and reflected: 'Keith was the love of my life, I absolutely loved him, I miss him.'

She continued to open up about Keith and shared: 'I was single and we went out and we did not stop laughing for the entire evening and then practically that was us together, almost for two years.

'The good thing was, he didn't really talk about work, I didn't really talk about work, we would just go and do fun things.

Gail added: 'I was actually doing a programme called Wish You Were Here ... I got asked to go to the Maldives ... me and Keith went and he had a few issues with a few things.'

Asked by Louis if he suffered with poor mental health, Gail continued: 'He had a few wobbles but by the end of it, he was swimming every day, we were going to the gym and both of us, our mental health was just so fantastic.

'Of course everyone is going to be extremely happy if you're in the Maldives, we were so lucky and then when we got back I said, "Right, I'm going to go back to work and you go back to work".

'He just didn't get his mind back into things properly. And he was going that way and I was like, we need to keep our minds positive and it just didn't work that way.  

'He was on a downer, I was trying to work my hardest, so it was a shame.'

Acknowledging they both had their issues, she said: 'I always thought there was going to be that moment when we are going to have bad times at different times and it kind of worked that way unfortunately.' 

In May, Gail revealed she 'never expected' the news of her ex-boyfriend's death, admitting that she was gobsmacked when she learned he had died. 

Keith was found dead in his home in Essex, with toxicology reports finding that the star had cocaine, alcohol and codeine in his system.

Following an inquest into his death, a coroner recorded an open verdict after ruling that there was insufficient evidence to rule he took his own life or that it was an accident.
