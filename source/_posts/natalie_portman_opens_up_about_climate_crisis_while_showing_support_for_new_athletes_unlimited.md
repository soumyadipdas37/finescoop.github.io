'The effects of the climate crisis have never been more visible. With intensified heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, Black and brown communities are being disproportionately affected not only by climate change but also by the COVID-19 crisis,' Portman began.

'As we fight for a more equitable and sustainable future, we need leaders pushing forward climate solutions while dismantling systemic racism at every level of government,' she added.

She returned in 2013's Thor: The Dark World, but she wasn't featured in 2017's Thor: Ragnarok.
