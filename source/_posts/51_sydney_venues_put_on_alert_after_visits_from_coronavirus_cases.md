There are now 51 venues across Sydney on high alert after they were visited by coronavirus-infected residents. 

New South Wales is battling just 86 active COVID-19 infections, but there are concerns the numbers could grow after contagious Sydneysiders attended restaurants, pubs, gyms and a medical centre. 

NSW Health has issued 'close contact' warnings for 13 venues, stretching all the way from the city's western suburbs to the east coast.

'Self-isolate and get tested immediately if you've been to these locations,' NSW Health said.
