The Premier League has found a new broadcasting partner in China, signing a deal with Tencent in China after cutting ties with PPTV earlier this month.

The league terminated its existing contract with PPTV, owned by Suning, after the withholding of a payment due under the terms of the deal in March.

The three-year deal with PPTV was announced last summer, and was reported to have been worth more than half a billion pounds.
