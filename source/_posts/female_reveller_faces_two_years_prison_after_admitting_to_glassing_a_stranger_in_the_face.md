A young female bar-goer faces two years in prison after admitting to glassing a stranger who was celebrating her birthday.

Kailey Marion Secomb, 22, has pleaded guilty to attacking Brooke Jeffers at the Brass Monkey Hotel in Northbridge, in Perth's inner city, on June 13. 

Ms Jeffers was celebrating her 22nd birthday and had only been inside the venue for ten minutes when she got into an argument with Secomb.

Brooke Jeffers, 22, was the victim of a vicious glassing while on her birthday night out with friends in June

They threw water onto each other before Secomb retaliated by throwing a glass at the birthday girl, The West Australian reported.

Blood started pouring from Ms Jeffers' face and she was rushed to Royal Perth Hospital for treatment.

She suffered cuts to her face and nose - some of which had to be sealed together with glue by doctors.  

In the days following the attack Ms Jeffers spoke out and said she came dangerously close to receiving more injuries.

'We were only in Brass Monkey for about 10 minutes before it happened - it kind of came out of nowhere and ruined the night,' the young woman told 7News at the time.  

'I was full of so much adrenaline I actually didn't feel anything. There was a lot going on and so much blood.'

However, Ms Jeffers said she was grateful she did not have more serious injuries.

'It could have been a lot worse and a lot more serious.The glass could have got in my eyes, so I am grateful for that,' she said.

Secomb was arrested two weeks later after police appealed to the public about the attack. 

On Monday Secomb admitted to unlawfully wounding Ms Jeffers in Perth Magistrates Court. 

Pubs in Western Australia were allowed to open their doors again for the first time since COVID-19 restrictions began a week before the attack on June 6.
