The Duchess of Cornwall wore a visor in public for the first time today as she paid a visit to a Medical Detection Dogs training centre. 

Camilla, 73, has worn fabric face masks on two previous occasions, including on an engagement yesterday, but decided to opt for a plastic visor for today's outing in Milton Keynes.

The royal decided to try out the visor because she feels it is 'easier to communicate' when you can 'see someone smile and speak', according to ITV royal correspondent Chris Ship. 

It is not known whether she will favour visors over face masks for future royal engagements.

The royal was made patron of the charity in 2014, and the organisation is currently trying to determine whether dogs can act as a diagnostic tool of Covid-19. 

She donned a full length plastic visor, an elegant royal blue below-the-knee dress paired with a nude handbag, orange leather shoes and a white daisy-themed brooch. 

The Duchess wore her blonde locks in a classic polished style and teamed her dress with dainty jewellery and a pair of pearl earrings. 

The royal looked thrilled to meet the Labradors and was seen grinning at the animals as she was met by charity employees. 

The charity is at the forefront of research into whether dogs are able detect the smell of human diseases and save lives. 

They have been researching whether dogs are able to detect cancer and other life-threatening diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and bacterial infections, for years. 

Their 'Bio Detection Dogs' are trained to find the odour of those diseases in samples such as urine, breath and sweat.

The charity also provide Medical Alert Assistance Dogs, who are trained to detect minute changes in an individual’s personal odour triggered by their disease and alert them to an impending medical event.  

They are now partnering with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and Durham University, to research how dogs can play a role in the fight against the Covid-19. 

The animals will be trained in the same way as dogs already trained to detect diseases like cancer.
