Georginio Wijnaldum will meet Jurgen Klopp for talks when he returns to Liverpool for key talks on his future.

The Netherlands midfielder is wanted by Barcelona head coach Ronald Koeman and has entered the final 12 months of his Anfield contract.

Wijnaldum has not given any indication so far that he would be prepared to leave and has carried on with business as usual.

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp would be happy to keep him, but hasn't offered a deal yet

Klopp would be happy for the 29-year-old to remain but will discuss the situation with Wijnaldum face-to-face to work out a plan.

Should Barcelona give Liverpool the chance to cash in on Wijnaldum, it would pave the way for Liverpool to move for Bayern Munich’s Thiago Alcantara. 

However the Catalans are also interested in a move for their former player, as their summer rebuild begins.  

Netherlands beat Poland 1-0 in their first Nations League match on Friday thanks to a late goal from Steven Bergwijn.

However they lost 1-0 to Italy on Friday, as Nicolo Barella found the net in first-half injury time.

Wijnaldum has scored 19 goals and provided 16 assists in 187 games for Liverpool since joining from Newcastle in 2016. 

He has played an important role in the team, but he has yet to be offered a new deal and there is a possibility that he could depart before the closure of the transfer window as the club are reluctant to lose him on a free transfer at the end of his contract.
