Brooklyn Beckham and fiancée Nicola Peltz put on a tender display when they were pictured leaving Nobu in Malibu on Wednesday after a romantic meal. 

The two complemented one another's style in dark clothing as they prepared to head home, while holding hands with one another. 

Their outing comes after Brooklyn, 21, was defended after being criticised for posted a now deleted Instagram photo in which he had his hand on Nicola's neck.

Brooklyn had stuck to a smart/casual dress code as he was pictured leaving the eatery wearing a dark jumper, smart indigo jeans and chunky boots.   

Nicola, 25, wore a plunging black trouser suit and heels, with the couple both sporting black face masks. 

Brooklyn has been defended by fans after he was slammed for playfully holding fiancée Nicola Peltz's neck on social media.

The founder of KWRO Women's Rights Organisation, Diana Nammi, had said it was 'disgusting' to share online and believes it is a mistake to turn such a serious matter into a joke.

But others thought this was an overreaction given that Brooklyn deleted the snap as soon as the criticism came to light and his intention, even if misguided, was to be light-hearted. 

One fan wrote: '@Diana Nammi and her rant against Brooklyn Beckham is why sometimes causes get lost in the sauce. 

'Anybody with eyes could see there was nothing untoward': Brooklyn has been defended after being slammed for holding fiancée Nicola's throat in a now deleted post on Instagram

'Anybody with eyes could see there was nothing untoward about their pic but i guess "the sky is falling" for Diana...focus on actual domestic violence ma'am and not silly pics on IG.'

Others took to social media to send their 'love' to Brooklyn after the comments were made.

However, others defended the newly engaged couple. One commented: 'Love you guys'. A second typed: 'Adorable,' while another wrote 'couple goals.' 

In the snap, posted earlier this week, David Beckham's eldest son, 21, flashed his tattooed arms as he held the actress, 25, by the neck while drinking wine at dinner 

KWRO is a charity that campaigns against issues such as domestic violence, honour-based violence and forced marriage.

Opposing views: Fans showed their support for Brooklyn as both sides of the debate were discussed 

Reacting to the picture of Brooklyn holding Nicola by the throat, which was posted by the Bates Motel star, Ms Nammi said: 'It is disgusting and I think with serious matters no one should allow themselves to make a joke.

'This is very important, an organisation like ours has seen so many women become victims of honour based violence, domestic violence, forced marriage - and they have been strangled by their own family and they have been killed by husbands, partners or boyfriends.

'So we are talking about real life, even if it's a joke it is disgusting in my opinion. I think it should be banned from Instagram this kind of picture. He is 21 so mature enough to know it is a very serious matter and I think he has to apologise openly and tell people that he made a huge mistake.

'We are talking about living people - it is not a doll to play with, so I think this is sending a very wrong message, a very dangerous message to young people especially.

'This kind of attitude is not acceptable and both men and women, especially women, need to be respected and their life needs to be celebrated.

'It is so dangerous and his position is so important and not only him but his family need to discuss it to say something in the media that they are not that approving of that, because of their position especially.

'In his position he should not do it at all and not even be thinking about that and I could not believe this kind of thing has happened. He is mature enough, he is not a baby playing with a doll.

'We are talking about an adult man talking about his girlfriend - and his girlfriend definitely must not accept that. I urge them to put a message of apology on Instagram and Twitter and everywhere on the media for their wrongdoing.

Close: The couple love to share loved-up pictures of themselves on social media

'People like us fighting on a daily basis, talking in schools, trying to educate people about the issues of domestic violence and how to have a healthy relationship.

'On a daily basis we are trying to bring these things to the school curriculum - for example healthy relationships need to be educated to people - but one message from an irresponsible like him gives a very big message to the whole world and this is so dangerous.

'I think he has to really learn how to treat women, he has to go to healthy relationship education courses and learn how to act as a responsible human being.'

MailOnline reached out to representatives for Brooklyn and Nicola for comment.  

The photograph also caught the attention of Brooklyn's fans, some of whom were alarmed by the way he clutched her throat. Some warned it could normalise domestic and sexual violence to their combined Instagram following of more than 14million people.

Jaye Taylor said: 'Every girlfriend he has had there are photos of him holding them round the neck. Even when he puts his arm around them it's really tight and looks like a headlock.

'Really odd the way he's never pictured with any male friends just his gfs who he falls in love with in two mins and then holds them by the throats etc.'

Jordan Moral asked: 'Why is he choking you though?' Another user echoed Jordan, saying: 'Why is he choking you?'  

Last week Nicola uploaded a black and white snap of her holding a topless Brooklyn by the throat while his face is covered in shaving cream.

She captioned the snap: 'i love you more everyday.' Brooklyn replied: 'I'm the luckiest boy in the world to have you by my side.' 

Love: Others defended the newly engaged couple. One commented: 'Love you guys'. A second typed: 'Adorable,' while another wrote 'couple goals.'
