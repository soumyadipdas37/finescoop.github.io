A drugs kingpin behind a vast international drug-smuggling network that trafficked £58million worth of heroin and cocaine into the UK was jailed for 21 years this afternoon.

Robert Brooks, 50, was behind the largest-ever drugs conspiracy investigation launched by the Easter Region Special Operations Unit, St Albans Crown Court heard. 

He tried to conceal the operation with a £15,000 encrypted phone contract, using the name Jaguar Palace. 

Between 2018 and last summer he had overseen 39 separate deliveries of heroin and cocaine to a rented unit at Little Samuels Farm in Hunsdon, East Hertfordshire.

But in August of last year detectives, having gathered the intelligence they needed, were ready to move against Brooks and his associates.

That month the network's last two deliveries were intercepted with 45 kilos of heroin and 70 kilos of cocaine being seized.

Taking into account the 39 deliveries detectives knew about, it was assessed that 1,835 kilos of Class A drugs had been imported with a total value was between £42million and £58million.

The drugs would come into the country from Europe hidden in lorries hidden under the bottom of consignments of worthless goods. 

One such load was a shipment of spider catcher devices that were of such little value they were thrown away in a skip.

On arrival at the farm the drugs would be unloaded by a fork lift truck into sheds and barns that had been rented out at the farm.

From there a courier drove with the class A drugs to the north of England.

Brooks described as the managing director of the English end of the network wasn't always present, preferring to direct operations from Spain.

The court heard the crime network was connected to Europe and much further afield. 

Brooks pleaded guilty to conspiracy to fraudulently evade the prohibition on the importation of a Class A drugs and possession of criminal property between November 2018 and August 2019. 

Tomasz Wozniak (pictured), 28, also from Milton Keynes who was the fork lift truck driver, admitted conspiracy controlled drugs of Class A. He was jailed for six years and three months 

Last week Richard Campbell, 49, from Milton Keynes who was the 'warehouse manager' at the farm admitted conspiracy to evade the prohibition of Class A drugs and was jailed for 13 and a half years.

Stephen Capp, 56, from Hull who went to the farm 18 times to collect drugs to deliver to the north of England was sentenced to nine years and six months.

He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply a drug of Class A on 18 visits to the farm. He also admitted possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply when he was stopped in December 2019 with 5 kilos of Class A drugs.

In his car was a 'sophisticated' hiding place for the drugs.

Pieter Mannessen received six years in Holland following the seizure of 70kg of cocaine that was due to be delivered to the farm.

Sentencing last week Judge Michael Kay QC said: 'Addiction to heroin and cocaine destroys the lives of hundreds of thousand of people.

He added: 'It causes heartbreak to parents, to children and to those who know addicts.It is also the cause a large element of crime in this country.' Pictured: Seized drugs

'It becomes, at times, all they think about. It destroys them and it destroyed their families. 

'It causes heartbreak to parents, to children and to those who know addicts.It is also the cause a large element of crime in this country. 

'People who are so badly addicted they can think of nothing else and will rob steal and cheat to obtain money to feed their craving for drugs. It is a scourge on society.'

The judge said: 'Those who make money from such misery and degradation of fellow citizen will achieve substantial prison sentence. The business is not just illegal, it is immoral and despicable.'

He said the men had been in a 'highly organised and sophisticated operation - at the top level of international drug dealing.'
