Western Australian man John Alexander Roy, 55, (pictured) has been identified as one of the alleged masterminds behind a failed $1billion drug importation plan in 2019

A convicted drug lord could be extradited back to Australia after he allegedly tried to import $1billion worth of drugs into the country. 

Western Australian man John Alexander Roy, 55, is expected to be charged over the failed plot and is currently serving a 12 year jail sentence in Britain for other drug offences.

In September 2019 WA Police launched a sea search after finding an unmanned yacht stuck on a reef about 60km west of Geraldton.

During the search officers found 40 bags containing cocaine, meth and ecstasy on nearby Burton Island, estimated to be worth $1billion.

Frenchman Antoine Dicenta and British man Graham Kurt Palmer were arrested a short time later. 

Three other men, Scott Felix Jones, Jason Lassiter and Angus Bruce Jackson, were also arrested. 

Roy's extradition over the one tonne seizure could take years because he will have to complete a non-parole period in Britain first. 

Roy, who was jailed in Britain last week for his role in a separate $1million drug plot, is allegedly one of the main organisers behind the 2019 bust which saw police seize one tonne of illicit drugs in Western Australia (pictured)

Assistant Commissioner Brad Royce told The West Australian the sophisticated drugs network was taking time to unravel. 

'There is still a lot more work to be done and our efforts will continue as we work our way towards the more senior members of the criminal network,' he said.

AFP State Manager for Western Australia, Commander Greg Harrigan praised authorities for foiling the alleged drug plot. 

'This seizure shows the power of the community and police agencies, both at home and overseas, working together to stop illicit drugs from reaching our shores,' he said.

'This is an attack on our society that is destroying individuals, families and whole communities.'

Roy was jailed in the UK last week for his role in the importation of MDMA, cocaine and cannabis resin with a street value of more than $1million into Jersey.  

He was also jailed for 14 years in 1998 for his role in a plot to smuggle eight tonnes of marijuana into Queensland.

Investigations into the West Australian seizure continue.
