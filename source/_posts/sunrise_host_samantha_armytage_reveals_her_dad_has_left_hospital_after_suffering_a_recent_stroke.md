A happy and relieved Samantha Armytage has revealed her father Mac is out of hospital after suffering a stroke.

On Thursday, the 43-year-old Sunrise host shared a video of her dad walking out of hospital in Sydney, assisted by a walking stick. 

'Here we go! Done. Look who's walking out of rehab... Good day, huh?' the TV host could be heard excitedly saying from behind the camera.

Stopping to talk to his daughter, Mac responded: 'Done. Beauty... It's not a bad day, yeah.'

Her beloved father seemed to be in high spirits, despite his recent health scare, and wore a pale blue disposable face mask. 

'So, THIS just happened... After a stroke and four weeks in rehab,' she captioned the video, adding a clapping hands emoji.

Sam also thanked the staff who had looked after him at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital.

'I cannot send enough emoji love heart eyes to all the wonderful nurses, physios & OT's at @stvincentshospitalsydney,' she added in a second post. 

In a post on Instagram last month, Sam revealed both her parents were in hospital at the same time, dealing with different ailments.

She said her mum, Libby, had been hospitalised with heart failure, while her dad had recently suffered a stroke.  

'As some of you may know, my mum Libby has been gravely ill for a while (she has an autoimmune disease which has resulted in heart failure) & on his way to visit her in hospital ten days ago, my dad Mac collapsed after having a stroke,' she wrote on Instagram on August 11.  

The breakfast show host included a photo of herself with her family, including her parents, in happier times.

Speaking about her father, Sam labelled him 'a tough old buggar', and said she was confident he'd make a full recovery.   

'Luckily he wasn't out the back of Wagga in a paddock as he probably wouldn't be here to tell the tale,' she continued.

'He's a tough old buggar & he's in rehab, frustrated but determined. And giving plenty of cheek to his long-suffering, wonderful nurses.'
