They are the TV star brothers who have hopes of being the next dynamic presenting duo.

And Curtis and AJ Pritchard showed off their playful sides as they posed with holograms of themselves for 02's new TikTok dance duet challenge on Thursday.

The Love Island star, 24, and the former Strictly pro, 25, looked to be having fun as their holograms danced in the sky while they posed up.

Curtis showed off his svelte frame in a graphic print tee and jeans as he mimicked his hologram's dance moves.

While AJ looked dapper in a pastel shirt and trousers  as he posed at London's Observation Point.

 The sighting comes as Love Island star Curtis recently credited his weight loss to the cruel abuse he faced from trolls. 

The reality star,admitted that after he was fat-shamed for piling on the pounds during his time in the villa, it gave him to motivation to slim down and get in shape.

Curtis' hard work certainly seems to have paid off as he recently revealed his ripped new physique in an array of snaps.

Curtis told Metro that after celebrating his first year as a WW (Weight Watchers) ambassador, he realises he wasn't 'focused' on keeping his body healthy, which led to his weight gain.   

The star admitted he was abused by social media trolls who noticed his weight gain following his appearance in the villa last year.

He said: 'Obviously with my dancing, I’ve always wanted to have this look and feel about myself and I didn’t have it.

 'And then going into Love Island, putting on a lot of weight and coming out again and being fat-shamed, it was really the perfect time to become an ambassador or WW and join the family.

'On a truthful note it isn’t nice to say something nasty about someone. It isn’t nice to do and be on the receiving end. But you know what, look at me now.'

Since overhauling his diet and fitness regime, Curtis has lost a stone, and isn't shy of flaunting his trim new physique in a range of social media snaps. 

 Curtis also laughed off claims he may be set to rekindle his romance with villa co-star Amy Hart, after the pair shared a cosy selfie from a night out at the Cabaret All Stars Show.

The reality star insisted they've stayed friends despite a difficult end to their romance in the villa, and there have been no hard feelings between them.

Curtis, a professional ballroom dancer with a talent for tango, left Amy devastated after he started to chase after single Islander Jourdan Riane while Amy was away in Casa Amor.

He then went onto date villa beauty Maura Higgins for seven months, but they split in March.
