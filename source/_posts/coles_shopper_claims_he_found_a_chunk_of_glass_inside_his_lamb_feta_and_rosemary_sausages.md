A Coles shopper has claimed he found a piece of glass inside a sausage he bought from the store - and he was not impressed with the supermarket's response.

The Melbourne man purchased the lamb, feta and rosemary snags for a sausage sizzle with his wife before making the discovery.

After taking a bite, the man felt something crunching on his teeth, but he dismissed it as gristle and swallowed it.

'I then took a second bite and found a chunk of glass,' he claimed on the supermarket's Facebook page on Sunday.

He began to fear he had already swallowed a piece of glass.

The man said he reported it to Coles immediately, but he felt staff didn't take his concerns seriously. 

He claimed they took days to respond to him.  

'I received a template email full of marketing rubbish claiming that their quality control was second to none. I was left feeling that they didn’t even believe me,' the man complained.

'After days of worry that I had swallowed glass and some surface damage to my teeth, all they offered was a refund. 

'I find their customer service appalling.'

A Coles spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the supermarket take the quality of their products seriously. 

'We have spoken to the customer and Coles is investigating the matter,' the spokeswoman said.

'As always we encourage customers to return any item they’re not 100 per cent happy with to their nearest store for a full refund or replacement.'
