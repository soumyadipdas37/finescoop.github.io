It wasn't the lavish destination wedding she had planned, but there was no shortage of glamour when society fashion designer Aruna Seth tied the knot last month. 

Aruna, who founded her eponymous shoe label in 2009, married her dashing fiance Thomas in an intimate civil ceremony at Chelsea Old Town Hall on August 26.

The couple, who were joined only by immediate family and bridesmaids due to the Government's Covid-19 restrictions, celebrated their nuptials with dinner and drinks at five-star The Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge.

Among the guests was architect Dara Huang, who shares a son with Princess Beatrice's new husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and has been friends with Aruna for a decade. The bond between them is clear to see in one of the photos taken by Aziz Khan of Muse Motion Pictures, who captured the day.  

The bride looked radiant in two creations by celebrity wedding dress designer Suzanne Neville. 

The first, worn for the civil ceremony, featured a flirty knee-length and flattering Bardot neckline, which Aruna paired with £600 heels from her own collection. 

The second dress was strapless, slinkier and perfect for the reception. The designer wore the number with another pair of £600 Aruna Seth heels.  

Aruna and Thomas had hoped to wed this summer in the stunning surrounds of Italy's Lake Como - an A-list hotspot where George and Amal Clooney famously have a home - but put their plans on hold due to Covid-19.

However the couple still wanted to exchange vows and 'make things official', as Aruna explained in an Instagram caption celebrating the day. 

'We finally made it official with an intimate civil ceremony at Chelsea town hall with our families followed by a garden drinks and dinner,' she wrote. 

'We had already cancelled our Lake Como wedding which was scheduled this summer 2020. However the most important thing was having a small beautiful day celebrating with our loved ones. Just immediate family and bridesmaids due to government covid guidelines.

'For the special day I had two wedding dresses that were both made my favourite British wedding designer Suzanne Neville which I paired with my Aruna Seth custom wedding heels. Now we wait for the pandemic to be over so we can celebrate properly in Italy next year!'

Aruna's father runs Ascot, which makes affordable, practical shoes. She studied business at Liverpool University, then got a job at investment bank Morgan Stanley.

After realising she wanted to design comfortable shoes with 'wow' factor, Aruna took a part-time shoe design course at the London College of Fashion. 

She secured the trademark and located factories while still in my Morgan Stanley job. Aruna finally quit in 2010, and launched a collection of 40 luxe yet comfortable designs finished with the Swarovski crystal farfalla ('butterfly' in Italian) symbol.

A turning point came the following year, when Pippa Middleton wore a pair of Aruna's shoes to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding reception. Sales rocketed by 50 per cent. Since then, her shoes have been worn by Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn, and Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice.

Last year, Aruna Seth opened a showroom in Sloane Street, London, in addition to selling through Harrods.
