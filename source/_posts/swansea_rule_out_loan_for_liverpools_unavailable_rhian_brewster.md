Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp appears to have Rhian Brewster in his plans for the upcoming season, as Swansea boss Steve Cooper says the striker has not been made available to go out on loan.  

'Rhian is with Liverpool now,' Cooper said, according to The Mirror. 'If Rhian was available then of course we'd be in the mix, but I don't think that's the case at the moment.' 

Brewster was on loan at Swansea for the back half of last season and had an impressive run, scoring 11 goals in 22 games.

Swansea boss Steve Cooper wants to bring Brewster back on loan but says he's unavailable

Cooper would like to keep Brewster on loan for the upcoming season as Swansea go in search of promotion once again, but doesn't believe he will be able to get his man at the current time.  

He has made four appearances for the Liverpool first team, most recently in the Community Shield where he missed a crucial penalty after coming on as a last minute substitute. 

It is thought the Englishman has under-performed compared to his ability when given his chance, however Klopp did take the blame for his shootout miss, saying he shouldn't have brought him on so late in the game.

It remains to be seen how much Jurgen Klopp will be using the striker in the upcoming season

Brewster will reportedly get his chance to shine in Liverpool's upcoming Carabao Cup third and fourth-round matches, having got a lot more experience under his belt at Swansea. 

He is less likely to start when Liverpool get their Premier League campaign underway against Leeds United next weekend. 

However Klopp will want to see Brewster in action before making a decision about his future, with the transfer window coming to a close on October 5.
