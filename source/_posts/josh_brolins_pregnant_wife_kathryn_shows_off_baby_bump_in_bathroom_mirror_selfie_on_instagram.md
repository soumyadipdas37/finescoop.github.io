Last month, Kathryn had revealed via her Instagram that she and her daughter Westlyn had upped sticks and moved away from California.

Sharing a photo of herself and her child in a cavernous empty room in their new home, she shared: 'The rest of the year brings a new adventure. Decided to skip out on our beloved Cali and move across the country.'

She then tagged her mom Deborah Boyd-Brown, who is a luxury real estate broker in Atlanta, Georgia, suggesting that she has moved to be closer to her mother as she awaits the birth of baby number two. 

A little while later, Josh joined his wife and daughter, an event Kathryn again celebrated on social media, posting a photo of her husband with the caption: 'Reunited with my person.'

Josh is also dad to two adult children from his first marriage to actress Alice Adair.

He is the son of actor James Brolin and his most recent big screen credits include Avengers: Endgame, Sicario: Day of the Soldado and Deadpool 2.
