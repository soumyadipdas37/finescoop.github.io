She celebrated her 39th birthday in style with her nearest and dearest earlier this month.

The Pussycat Doll singer commanded attention as she showcased her typical style once again by wearing pale brown co-ords.

Exuding utility chic, the presenter styled her multi-pocket jacket with matching, wide-leg trousers.

The dancer tied in her two-piece with a clingy cream bodysuit, which coordinated with her classic handbag.

Ditching her signature heels, the TV and radio star donned a pair of comfy trainers by Gucci, and accessorised with circular-framed shades and hooped earrings.

The media personality recently revealed she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future.

Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine in July, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

The blonde also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29.

They called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018.

The TV star said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.'
