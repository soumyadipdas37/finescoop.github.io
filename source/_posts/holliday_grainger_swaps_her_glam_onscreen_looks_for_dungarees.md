She's back on TV screens in the new series of Strike: Lethal White.

And while viewers of the debut episode on Sunday night saw Holliday Grainger don an array of glam looks, including a wedding dress, in real life she favours a more casually cool look.

The actress, 32, showed off her sense of style in a pair of denim dungarees as she strolled hand in hand with her actor beau Harry Treadaway, 31, in London recently.

Holliday teamed her loose-fitting overalls with a black jacket and trainers, beaming as she clutched a dressed-down Harry's hand. 

The talented pair have been dating since 2015, and live together in North London.

Harry is best known for playing Victor Frankenstein on the horror-drama series Penny Dreadful while he also appeared as Roddy Llewellyn in the third series of Netflix's The Crown as well as a starring role in Mr Mercedes. 

After a smattering of British TV appearances, Holliday rose to prominence when she played Estella in Mike Newell's 2012 version of Great Expectations, before going on to star in Disney's Cinderella alongside her close friend Lily James.

She also starred n hit BBC drama The Capture in 2019 and this weekend has been back on the small screen, reprising her role as Robin Ellacott in the Strike franchise.

Lethal White follows on from The Cuckoo’s Calling, The Silkworm and Career of Evil, and sees Strike (Tom Burke) enlist the help of Robin as a salaried partner in his detective agency.

After a year of working together, Strike asks Robin to go undercover after Member of Parliament asks them to investigate blackmail, corruption and murder.

The first series adapted Rowling's first three Strike novels into mini-series, with The Cuckoo’s Calling being given three episodes, and The Silkworm and Career of Evil getting two each. 

The author behind Harry Potter caused literary thrill when it was revealed she had been writing a number of adult books under a pseudonym Robert Galbraith in 2013.
