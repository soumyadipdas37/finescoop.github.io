Irena Srbinovska is one of the rumoured finalists in the pursuit of Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert's heart on the eighth season of The Bachelor.

But the 31-year-old doesn't always go by the name loyal viewers are used to hearing.

An inside source told Daily Mail Australia on Monday that while the Melbourne-based nurse is happy to go by 'Irena', her real name is an ode to her Macedonian heritage.

The source claimed Irena's pronunciation should be 'Ee-renna (with a European-sounding 'r'), instead of the version heard on TV - 'Eye-reen-ah'.

In fact, some of Irena's family members post videos about the show while using the correct pronunciation.

It's believed her name is written exactly the same, but the pronunciation on the show is not the 'real' intended way for Irena's name to be spoken.

'She doesn't choose to go by it and doesn't like to have to correct people': The insider told Daily Mail Australia that Irena always introduces herself with the 'eye-reen-ah' pronunciation, because the correct way is often too difficult for people to pronounce

The insider told Daily Mail Australia that Irena always introduces herself with the 'eye-reen-ah' pronunciation, because the correct way is often too difficult for people to pronounce.

'Not many people call her "Ee-renna" really, because she doesn't choose to go by it and doesn't like to have to correct people.'  

It's believed Irena told Locky and the other women in the mansion of her 'real', accurate name pronunciation, but for consistency they have continued to use ''Eye-reen-ah' on screen.
