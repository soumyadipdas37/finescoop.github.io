Zara McDermott hit the beach in Cyprus on Monday, just hours before the dramatic Made In Chelsea series opener aired, in which she was branded a 'fame w***e'.

But the Love Island star, 23, put her worries and heartache following her Sam Thompson split to one side, as she slipped into a pink butterfly thong bikini for a day of sunbathing. 

Zara, who lost two stone last year after overhauling her fitness and lifestyle routine, looked tanned and toned as she soaked up the sun.

Zara showed off her taut midriff and a hint of cleavage in the tiny low-scoop bikini top which was adorned with a cute butterfly print. 

The thong bottoms meanwhile highlighted her peachy derriere and leggy frame. 

Zara opted for comfort with a pair of black flip flops and arrived at the beach in an oversized white T-shirt which had the slogan 'essentials' emblazoned across the chest. 

She toted a rucksack and tied her brunette locks back in a low bun.

The television personality showcased her natural beauty and sun-kissed tan by going make-up free for her beach trip. 

After arriving with her pal, Zara stripped off her white shirt and set up came at a sun lounger so as to enhance her already bronzed tan. 

The pair appeared engrossed in their phones with the amateur singing perhaps anxious about the return of Made In Chelsea. 

Zara's trip to the beach comes after she was branded a 'fame w***e' by Melissa Tattam on Monday night's explosive episode of the show.

Aghast at the rumours about Tiffany Watson and her now ex-boyfriend Sam’s alleged recent provocative chat, Melissa said: 'If Harry’s ex talked about their sex life to him I would literally vomit in my mouth.' 

Later when Zara and Sam confronted Tiffany at their country house party, the discussion became heated with the blonde beauty saying she never wants to talk to Sam again.

Sam then told Olivia Bentley she 'doesn't care about Zara', which prompted her to throw her drink over Sam and tell him to 'get the f**k out of my house'.

The Love Island star stood there open-mouthed as Sam stormed off before Liv went on to her that her allegedly 'best pal' Melissa had called her a 'fame-hungry w***e'. 

Determined to make her message clear, Liv took Tiffany's phone and replayed the message in which Melissa hit out at Zara.

The dramatic first episode comes in the midst of her devastating split from Sam, 27, amid claims she cheated on him with 'someone in the music industry' around the time she took part in X Factor: Celebrity. 

The reality star appeared on the series last summer and autumn, as part of the Love Island pop group No Love Lost.

At this point, she had been in a relationship with Sam for several months – but it's said the newly-single star has only recently found out about the infidelity. 

A source told MailOnline: 'Zara cheated on Sam with someone in the music industry. Someone connected to the X Factor.   

'Sam is obviously distraught about this. He only found out about it very recently and has escaped for a few days. 

'Zara regrets it and feels terrible. She knows it was a huge mistake and is extremely upset.

'Zara and Sam split towards the end of last month. They had been arguing a lot since moving in together as a result of lockdown and things just built up between them.

'Zara has moved back to her parents' house in Essex where she's taking some time for herself, she really loved Sam so this hasn't been easy for her.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Zara and Sam for comment at the time.
