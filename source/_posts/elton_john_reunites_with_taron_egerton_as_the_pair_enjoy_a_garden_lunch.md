Elton John and Taron Egerton have reunited for a garden lunch after not seeing each other since January.

The pair became fast friends after Taron, 30, portrayed Elton, 73, in Rocketman, a film about his life which won rave reviews.

Elton took to Instagram and shared a snap of the pair standing in front of a garden hedge with Taron holding a Yorkshire Terrier.

Alongside the snap, Elton wrote: 'Lunch in the garden with this lovely man. We haven’t seen each other since the Golden Globes. Love him so much ❤️'. 

Elton was dressed casually for the day, donning a navy polo shirt along with a pair of red tracksuit bottoms.

Taron looked dapper in a beige jacket and matching trousers along with a white shirt and a pair of shades. 

The actor won Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes for his portrayal of the legendary musician.

Taken by surprise when he won the award, Taron forgot to thank Elton while he was on stage and spoke about the moment on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show.  

He explained: 'I do regret that, I left Elton John hanging when I was winning an award for playing Elton John. 

'But you know what? You aren't in your right kind of mind in that moment, I also made the great faux pas of forgetting to thank the HFPA [Hollywood Foreign Press Association] who vote on the Golden Globes.

'You're just not thinking straight and I haven't had a lot of practice at winning awards so I didn't nail it.' 

Taron stressed that Elton wasn't bothered by the incident, and added that 'the rest of the awards show we were holding hands.' 

The actor's next project is the upcoming animated film Sing 2 where he will be lending his voice alongside Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon.
