Paris Jackson looked as if she was having a great time as she met up with a friend on Wednesday morning.

The daughter of Michael Jackson, 22, grinned ear-to-ear while sitting down with her pal for some breakfast in Beverly Hills.

The singer–songwriter rocked a comfy casual look for her outing, including a gray–blue cut-off sweatshirt for the indie rock group Manchester Orchestra, whose singer she recently collaborated with.

The shirt showed off a hint of her flat tummy, and she paired it with purple and white tie-dyed sweatpants that she wore rolled up to her knees.

Paris kept up the ultra-casual look with a gray set of well-worn sneakers, and she carried a cloth handbag covered in colorful designs.

Her friend arrived in a white tank top under a burnt orange cardigan and wearing acid wash cut-off jeans with a large hole over one thigh.

Both women wore simple masks, with Paris opting for a red bandana while her friend had on a burnt orange polka dotted scarf that matched her sweater.

Having a blast: Paris seemed to be enjoying their conversation once they sat down outside the restaurant, and at one point she appeared to be snapping a photo of her friend with her phone

Paris seemed to be enjoying their conversation once they sat down outside the restaurant, and at one point she appeared to be snapping a photo of her friend with her phone.

Her outing followed reports earlier that she had split from her boyfriend Gabriel Glenn, though the breakup was described as 'amicable,' according to TMZ.

Beginning at the end of June, she starred on the six-part Facebook Watch docuseries Unfiltered: Paris Jackson & Gabriel Glenn, which detailed her musical career in the wake of her father's death in 2009, as well as her relationship with Gabriel, with whom she collaborates in the duo The Soundflowers.

The two released their first self-titled EP in June, consisting of five songs.

During the documentary series, Paris also delved into her sexuality and admitted that she had 'dated more women than men.'

However, she resisted the term bisexual, which she didn't fully encompassed her attractions.

'I've dated more than just men and women; I've dated a man that had a vagina,' she explained.

Since her breakup, Paris has regularly been spotted heading into a studio to record new music, though it's not clear if she's working with The Soundflowers or on solo material.

Making music: Paris' Manchester Orchestra fandom extended beyond just her shirt, as she collaborated with the band's singer and guitarist Andy Hull earlier this month

Paris' Manchester Orchestra fandom extended beyond just her shirt, as she collaborated with the band's singer and guitarist Andy Hull earlier this month.

Early this month, she posted two photos of herself on a studio floor as she played guitar with the rocker. 

'thank you for the most incredible and unforgettable experience,' she captioned the photos of their collaboration.

'It was an absolute honour to create with you guys, especially on a project so vulnerable and raw and close to my heart. I poured my soul into these songs when I wrote them, and you guys took it to a level I could have never even imagined,' she said, while also tagging band members and producers Robert McDowell, Jamie Martens and Dan Hannon.

 'The kindness, thoughtfulness, and love you guys exhibited is beyond my ability to describe. Not to mention it’s rare and a total privilege for an amateur musician to be able to say she got to work with her heroes on her first album. I am eternally grateful,' she concluded.

So far, Paris hasn't revealed when her fans will get a chance to hear her new tracks.
