A hooded man allegedly chased a screaming 14-year-old schoolgirl and grabbed her arm during an attempted abduction before she broke free.

The girl was walking home from a friend's house in Biddulph, Staffordshire, when she noticed a man - believed to be in his 30s - following her.

The hooded stranger then allegedly chased after her between Thames Drive and Moorland Road, and eventually grabbed her.

But the terrified child was able to wrestle free from his grip and then 'ran for her life' after the shocking incident at 5.45pm on Monday.  

Police are now hunting the suspect, believed to be in his 30s, who was wearing a blue hooded coat and dark tracksuit bottoms with white stripes down the legs.

The girl's mother told the Stoke Sentinel: 'She felt uneasy and started walking faster and when he was still following she broke into a run.

'She thought she had lost him but when she stopped he grabbed her right arm from behind and he was screaming at her. 

'She was so scared she couldn't tell what he was saying. 

'She was screaming for him to get off her. She managed to elbow him and wriggle out of his grip and started running again.

'She didn't know where she was so rang her friend's mum who came and picked her up in the car and brought her home to me.' 

The mother-of-three added: 'She was in an absolute state. She had fear written all over her face. She has no idea what he was going to do with her.

'We think he may have been trying to abduct her. She just panicked and struck out.

'She's still very shaken but she wanted to go into school as she didn't want to be at home thinking about what happened.'

Staffordshire Police are now appealing for CCTV, with a spokesman saying: 'Police are investigating after it was reported that a teenage girl was approached by a man on Thames Drive in Biddulph at around 5.45pm on Monday.

'He is described as tall, in his 30s, wearing a blue tracksuit with the hood up. The girl was not harmed and ran away.

'Officers are carrying out inquiries, including CCTV, to trace the man.'
