She recently started home schooling her two children, Charlotte and Rocky, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

And Sarah Michelle Gellar managed to find some time for herself as she enjoyed an exercise class with pals on Sunday in the Brentwood neighbourhood of LA. 

The Buffy The Vampire Slayer actress, 43, cut a casual figure for the outside workout session in dark blue leggings which accentuated her toned frame.

Sarah continued her sporty look with a simple white t-shirt and light blue cardigan with buttons down the front.

The blonde beauty wore her locks tied back into a ponytail and added a pair of chic aviator sunglasses to her ensemble.

Making sure to stay safe, the mother-of-two also donned a white mask which covered both her nose and mouth as she walked out of the exercise class.  

It comes after Sarah and her friend Shannen Doherty, 49, shared their attempt at the TikTok WineChallenge, which involves sipping a glass of wine without hands.

Sporty: The actress, 43, paired her dark blue leggings with some comfortable trainers and a simple white t-shirt for the outing

The women could be seen sitting on the grass with Shannen holding the base of a  half-filled wine glass between her teeth while slowly leaning backward so Sarah could successfully drink the wine from behind her.

'#winechallenge well... it’s #laborday weekend and we always spend it with @theshando (usually involving the #malibuchilicookoff ) but since this year the party just consists of us, we figured why not try the wine challenge,' the 43-year-old Emmy winner captioned the footage.  

She joked: 'We ARE the party. #quarantine month 6.'

Long weekend: Sarah had fun with her pal Shannon Doherty over the weekend, with the women sharing their attempt at the TikTok #winechallenge on Instagram

Having fun: The actress joked that she and pal Shannen 'are the party' as they celebrated Labor Day weekend 

The fun weekend activities came after Sarah kicked off homeschooling for her two children but ended up jokingly asking her Instagram followers to 'send help'.

On Wednesday she revealed to fans that things hadn't been going too smoothly, as on the first day of school the fire alarm had already gone off.

'In case anyone was wondering how the first day went... the fire alarm started going off ten minutes in ... and no ladder we had was tall enough to reach... so seems about right for 2020 #sendhelp #homeschool #teachersareheroes,' Sarah said.

'Send help': While earlier in the week Sarah jokingly asked for assistance from fans after her first day of homeschooling didn't get off to the smoothest start 

In the video, Sarah stood in her living room holding onto two signs announcing her children's first day of school in quarantine. 

'Send help,' Sarah whispered to the camera. 

Sarah and her husband Freddie Prinze Jr. share daughter Charlotte, 10, and son Rocky, eight, together. 

Sarah and Freddie, 44, tied the knot in Mexico in 2002 just two years after they first started dating.
