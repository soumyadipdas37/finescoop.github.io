Dr Dre's estranged wife Nicole Young has filed court documents seeking in-person depositions for their divorce case amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The 50-year-old mother-of-two wants Dre, 55, to be available for 21 hours of depositions, according to legal documents obtained by TMZ for an article Tuesday.

Young wants Dre, real name Andre Romelle Young, to be questioned by her lawyers for eight hours about the validity of their prenuptial agreement and for 13 hours over financial issues, according to the court documents.

Court papers included allegations made by Young that Dre already had missed previously scheduled depositions.

Young claimed the reason for Dre missing them was simple, saying 'his entire career and public persona are based on defiance of authority, violence and refusal to comply with the law'.

She further alleged that Dre due to his estimated worth of $1 billion believes that rules don't apply to him and 'has grown accustom to doing whatever he likes, whenever he so chooses'.

Young in the court papers claimed that Dre's credibility was a crucial part of their dispute over the validity of the prenup and thus required an in-person deposition instead of a virtual meeting online.

She claimed that Dre was not particularly at-risk for contracting COVID-19 and insisted he could be deposed in person with appropriate safeguards in place, according to court papers.

Young also wanted the court to levy a $50,000 fine against Dre for not following the rules in their divorce case.

Dre and Young were married in 1996 and she filed for divorce in June after 24 years of marriage citing irreconcilable differences.

Young later filed court documents justifying her request for $2 million per month in spousal support that included itemized breakdowns.

According to the filings obtained by TMZ, the vast majority of her expenses were listed as 'Entertainment,' and she was seeking $900,000 per month to cover those costs.

Young also claimed she needs $10,000 per month to keep the house clean and to get her laundry done, and requires another $135,000 to pay for new clothes each month.

She also was looking to keeping her charitable donations in place with $125,000 each month, while also needing a head-scratching $20,000 each month to pay for her telephone, cell phone and email use.

Young and Dre have two children together, son Truice, 23, and daughter Truly, 19.

Compton, California native Dre rose to fame as an original member of the gangsta rap group N.W.A. and became a platinum-selling solo artist in the 1990s.

Dre released his Beats headphones in July 2008 and tech giant Apple in May 2014 purchased the Beats brand for $3 billion.

Young was previously married to former NBA player Sedale Threatt, 58.
