Arsenal's hopes of signing Thomas Partey could be boosted by Atletico Madrid's interest in Lucas Torreira.

The Gunners have been heavily linked with a move for Partey throughout the transfer window as they look to strengthen their resources in midfield.

According to El Gol Digital, Atletico manager Diego Simeone rates Torreira highly.

The report indicates that Arsenal could offer Torreira to Atletico as part of a cash-plus-player deal.

Torreira has yet to play for Arsenal this season and has struggled to work his way back into the team since recovering from injury towards the end of last season. 

Arsenal have so far been unwilling to match Atletico's demands of paying Partey's £45million release clause.

Ghana international Partey is said to be interested in making the move to Arsenal. 

In addition to Partey, Arsenal have also been linked with a move for Lyon's Houssem Aouar, with Mikel Arteta's side certainly in need of extra creativity in midfield.

So far in this transfer window Arsenal have brought in Willian, Gabriel Magalhaes and Alex Runarsson, while Dani Ceballos returned on loan from Real Madrid.
