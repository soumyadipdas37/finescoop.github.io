They recently relocated to the UK after years of living in Los Angeles.

And Cat Deeley and her husband Patrick Kielty are enjoying all the luxuries of life in the capital as they headed to Nobu on Park Lane for dinner on Tuesday. 

The So You Think You Can Dance? host, 43, and TV funnyman, 49, who share sons Milo, four, and James, two, were out to celebrate their eighth wedding anniversary, during which Cat put on a stunning display in a chic black ensemble.

Cat looked stunning for the dinner, as she showcased her lengthy legs in the thigh-skimming mini which belted at her tiny waist. 

Putting safety first, she donned a face covering, while wearing her famous locks - which won her a contract with Pantene - in loose, bouncy lengths. 

Patrick meanwhile went for a stylish bomber jacket over a light blue shirt as he chivalrously led his wife to a waiting cab outside the eatery. 

Cat and husband Patrick recently relocated to the UK after living in Los Angeles for 14 years, where she hosted US series So You Think You Can Dance?

Loved-up: They looked happier than ever as they stepped out 

Speaking about her move to the US, she said: 'I think the thing that would surprise the young me about her future is what's happened in America.

'I mean, I never went to America when I was a kid. I never went to Disneyland or anything like that, I'd never even seen it before. And when I did go, I never made a great proclamation: ''I'm going to crack America.''

'A relationship had just ended and I just fancied a fun adventure. It did feel crazy at times... There's no way my 16-year-old self would believe me if I went back and told her she'll be there one day.'

Sweet: The couple could not tear themselves from one another after the dinner

The veteran host also recently confirmed that she will be reuniting with her SMTV co-hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly for a one-off special looking back at the beloved Saturday morning show.

The presenter told The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X that she's already filmed the special and it will air at the end of the year.

'I can confirm… yes.' Cat teased, when asked about it by Chris. 'We have filmed a documentary, it's going to be aired at the end of the year.

'We went back to the studio where we did it. They rebuilt the set. We all cried. I walked in and [Ant & Dec] were doing their interview and Dec was crying and I was like ''ok you're crying!'' and then at the end of my interview I was like [sobs] ''waaah!''
