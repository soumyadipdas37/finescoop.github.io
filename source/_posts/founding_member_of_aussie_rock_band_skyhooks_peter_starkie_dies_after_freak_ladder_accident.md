'Quite honestly this is just a f***ing tragedy especially for Dianna and the girls. (and in lockdown!)

'So one and all, as my mother would say, ''count your Blessing''.' 

Skyhooks shot to fame in the mid-70s with hits such as Horror Movie, Ego is Not A Dirty Word, All My Friends Are Getting Married and Women In Uniform.
