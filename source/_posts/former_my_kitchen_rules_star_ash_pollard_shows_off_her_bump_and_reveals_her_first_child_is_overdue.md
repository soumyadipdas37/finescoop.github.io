Excited: Ash announced that she was expecting her first child with Peter (pictured) on her HIT 101.3 breakfast show in March 

She told The Daily Telegraph: 'I had no idea I was pregnant and I was so sick… just absolutely so ill during the filming of that show, I can't even tell you.' 

In between rehearsals for the strip show and early starts on Sea FM, the radio host thought she was just exhausted. 

'I get up for breakfast radio every morning and was absolutely burning the candle at both ends, so I just thought it was that,' Ash said.
