Goodness! Lauren Goodger took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a racy snap of herself in a tiny high-rise black sheer bodysuit with a plunging neckline

In her racy snap, Lauren showcased her curves in a tiny high-rise black sheer bodysuit with a plunging neckline.

The star let out the racy lingerie take centre stage as she forwent any jewellery and accessories for the photo.

Lauren styled her brunette locks into a high ponytail and she added a slick of glamorous make-up.

The former TOWIE star knew how to work her best angles as she posed up a storm and held onto a blind, which appeared to be taken in a hotel room.

Lauren's sultry snap comes as she revealed in this week's New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame. 

She told the publication: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.

'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me.' 

Lauren's mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father at just four-years-old, who started his 'own life'.  

She told New! magazine: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.'  

She added that her family 'set her up to fail': 'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".'

Lauren insisted that she is happy as she has her own circle of close friends, who she does family things with.

Yet despite not talking to her parents, Lauren recently posted a childhood photograph with her father to Instagram from when she was a bridesmaid aged five. 

The reality star also hit back at trolls, after she was accused of being an 'attention seeker', calling herself a 'rock star'.

Since appearing on TOWIE, Lauren has set up her own OnlyFans account, which she regularly promotes on her Instagram with racy snaps. 

Lauren branded her 'haters' as 'jealous' and said that they must be 'deeply unhappy' in their lives to target her.  

It comes after Lauren vowed to take a month off drinking following her boozy outing with a mystery man at Cirque le Soir in Soho in August. 

The former TOWIE star took to Instagram on Sunday to reveal she was left 'cringing' after her appearance and asked her social media followers to give her 'willpower' to resist alcohol ahead of a pal's upcoming birthday party.
