His rival manages to dodge the blade for the most part but it is unclear whether it makes contact with his face at one point.

Another bystander can be heard shouting: 'Stop it! Stop.'

The pair continue to square up to one another before the knife-wielding man starts to chase after the other. 

The rival eventually manages to run down the stairs with his friends and escape.   

It is unknown why the fight erupted between the young men or whether either individual sustained injuries.  

A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'Officers were called to Stratford station at 1.13pm on 28 September following reports of a stabbing.' 

No arrests have been made.
