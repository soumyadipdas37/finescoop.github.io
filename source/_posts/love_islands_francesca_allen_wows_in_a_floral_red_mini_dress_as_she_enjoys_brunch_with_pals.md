She never fails to turn heads whenever she steps out.

And Francesca Allen looked sensational as she flaunted her toned physique while heading to brunch with friends in London on Thursday.

The Love Island star, 24, looked ready for autumn as she showed off her figure in a red mini dress which was covered in a pretty floral pattern for the outing.

Francesca posed up a storm in her frock which came in at the waist to accentuate her slim frame and boasted long sleeves.

Keeping her accessories to a minimum, the fashion boutique owner only toted a small beige bag with a chic top handle.

She added some extra height to her ensemble with a pair of knee-high sueded boots with a brown leather heel.

To complete her look, the brunette beauty wore her long locks down and perfectly styled into loose waves as well as adding a slick of nude lipstick.

It comes after Fran celebrated her sister Claudia's birthday with a sweet snap of the siblings with their mother at a rooftop bar on Saturday

She captioned the shot: 'My girls ❤️ happy birthday to my sister @claudia_allen1 your loved more than you could ever imagine ❤️.'

Claudia is in a relationship with Mummy Diaries star Paul Knightley's brother Tony and their share a baby son, Tony, together.

Poser: Francesca toted a small beige handbag with a top-handle but appeared to keep her other accessories to a minimum 

Aside from her frequent getaways, Francesca was spotted cosying up to a new man during a boozy night out in London earlier this summer.

She looked to be on cloud nine as she got up close and personal with Edward Crossan, vice chairman of London-based waste management company Powerday. 

The TV personality, who is family friends with Edward, put on a very affectionate display with the hunk who was previously been linked to TOWIE's Amber Turner.

In May last year, Edward was seen enjoying a jaunt on a yacht in Ibiza with TOWIE star Amber, 27, who is currently dating Dan Edgar.

The accomplished businessman was named vice chairman of his father's company in January and is featured on the company's website.

MailOnline contacted Francesca's representatives for further comment at the time of publication.
