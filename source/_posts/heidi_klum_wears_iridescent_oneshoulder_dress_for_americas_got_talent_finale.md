She's been keeping busy filming for America's Got Talent, which will come to an end on Wednesday.

And Heidi Klum ensured she wrapped up the competition's 15th series with a bang as she stunned in a dazzling outfit to film the finale on Tuesday.

In a series of images shared to her Instagram account, the judge, 47, looked sensational in iridescent one-shoulder dress by Alex Perry, which highlighted her toned legs.

The supermodel caught the eye with her glowing ensemble, complete with a ruched skirt and balloon-style sleeves.

Standing tall, the former Project Runway host teamed her number with black ankle-strap heels, and accessorised with a selection of gold jewellery.

The blonde's fringed tresses framed her youthful-looking face, which was accentuated with dewy make-up.

On social media, the TV star transformed into an anime character as she played with the platform's filters.

On Tuesday's episode, Cristina Rae emerged as a frontrunner as judge Howie Mandel called her 'the one to beat.'

The Nashville singer shone in the spotlight as she unleashed her powerful vocals on the 2012 song Demons by Imagine Dragons, hitting incredible high notes at the end.

'Save the best for last,' raved Heidi, who'd given Cristina her Golden Buzzer during auditions. 'Everyone is amazing, but you are the most amazing. You have a light that cannot be dimmed.'

'I wish nothing more than for you to get a million dollars tomorrow,' the catwalk queen added, referring to the results show that will air Wednesday. 'Fingers and toes crossed!'

'You are the one to beat,' judge Howie, 64, added. 'That's my prediction. Watch tomorrow! You couldn't have done better.'

Cristina, who had lived in her car while pregnant with her toddler, Jeremiah, said that she'd been looking for a home 'for a long time,' and she'd found one in AGT.

Winning would secure her home and her son's future, she told show host Terry Crews, 52.

Cristina, 30, had steep competition from nine other contestants, all of whom hoped to win the show's grand prize of $1 million and a headlining show of their own in Las Vegas.

Alan Silva, a Brazilian acrobat, made the judges' jaws drop with his act, which found him spinning and flipping from restraints while stories up in the air, as rain beat down on him.

He was lifted up, again and again, and flew like a bird around the water-soaked set, sometimes by just one hand, garnering cheers from viewers who'd been streamed in.

For the 3'10' contestant, the adulation was especially rewarding, because he'd struggled for so long.

'My entire life I felt rejected by society because of my size,' Alan said in a pre-taped video, adding that the love of his wife and children had helped him imagine a better future.

Alan's wife, Bethany Silva, showed up to surprise him before his performance, and watched backstage as he aced his death-defying act, with Ruelle's Live Like Legends playing.

The judges: Heidi, Howie and new judge Sofia Vergara evaluated the 10 finalists

'People really underestimated you,' Heidi told Alan afterward. 'People bullied you because of your size. And I really do hope that all of these people are watching right now.'

'It gets better and better, Alan,' added new judge Sofia Vergara, 48. 'This was so artistic, the water, the fire, you looked so amazing up there. And down here, too, you look great.'

Howie pointed out that the act seemed like 'the most dangerous one' Alan had done yet, as the acrobat had had to 'hold on for dear life,' while he was soaking wet.

Alan agreed and said, 'I just want to empower people and help people realize that they were born for greatness, no matter how they look, no matter what they go through.'

The host: Terry Crews hosted the live, two-hour finale on NBC

The two-hour finale show opened with a stunning performance by Roberta Battaglia, an 11-year-old singer from Toronto, who sounded like a pro on Alessia Cara's 2015 hit Scars To Your Beautiful. 

Sofia, who had given Roberta her Golden Buzzer during auditions, told the girl that she had a 'very special place' in her heart, while Heidi predicted Roberta would have a long career.

Bad Salsa, a dance duo from Kolkata, India, next unveiled a jaw-dropping, perfect routine full of spins, jumps and twists, made all the more incredible because they'd flown 22 hours to AGT.

The duo had already been saved once by the judges during the semifinals, and broke down sobbing because the opportunity meant so much to them and their families.

On the finale, they executed their act so impressively that the judges jumped out of their seats to applaud them. 

Kenadi Dodds, a 15-year-old singer from North Logan, Utah, followed their act by belting Carrie Underwood's 2018 tune Love Wins, which led Heidi to compare her to 'a young Taylor Swift.'

Brandon Leake, a 27-year-old spoken-word artist from Stockton, California, then took his turn, reciting a poem for his baby, with whom he said he'd fallen in love before they even met. 

'You leave me speechless, you really do,' Howie told Brandon, his Golden Buzzer pick, after he finished his piece. 'I've never experienced anything like this in my life.'

Broken Roots, a Chicago-based musical duo, also wowed with an edgy version of Phil Collins' 1981 classic In The Air Tonight, singing and strumming guitar on a lit-up flatbed truck.

'What an amazing ride for you,' Sofia told the men, who'd once been sent home from the show, but brought back when an act dropped out. 'Every time I see you, I like you more.'

The Bello Sisters, a trio of Italian acrobats aged 13, 19, and 22, won fans with their complicated pyramids and even had their father use a crossbow to shoot a flower they were holding.

'It is surprising to some people that we go from being these innocent girls to being these strong women on the stage,' admitted acrobat Loren Bello, 22.

Archie Williams, a 59-year-old singer from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, then crooned The Beatles' 1968 song Blackbird, emphasizing the line about 'waiting for this moment to be free.'

He had served 36 years in prison after being wrongly incarcerated on rape and murder charges, and lately received letters from other ex-prisoners and their families.

'Knowing that I gave people hope is the most amazing thing in my life,' Archie sighed. 'Everything that I have gone through, I really feel that it was fate that led me this way.'

After Archie sang, Heidi told him, 'It seems like The Beatles did write that song for you. It's your story and you're flying. Actually, you're not flying. You're soaring.'

Daneliya Tuleshova, a 14-year-old singer from Kazakhstan, rocked AGT with her effortless performance of Sia's 2015 single Alive, which she performed on a dark, rainy forest set.

'You are flawless,' Sofia told her. 'Every time you're here, you're better and better.'

America's Got Talent will air its season 15 live finale results show on Wednesday on NBC.
