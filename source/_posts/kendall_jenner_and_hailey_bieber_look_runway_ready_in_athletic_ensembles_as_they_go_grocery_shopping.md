They are both stunning models who run in the same circles, and they have struck a close friendship.

And Kendall Jenner was again seen with pal Hailey Bieber on Monday, as the pair visited a Los Angeles, California Whole Foods to do some grocery shopping.

Kendall, 24, was joined by Hailey, 23, in the supermarket after the latter was seen briefly talking to her husband, Justin Bieber, outside in a vehicle.

Kendall was in a chic black ensemble for the errand run, matching a bralet top with capri leggings.

The older sister of Kylie Jenner wore ovular black sunshades, and a brown face mask in accordance with requirements to cover one's face while out in public due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Jenner completed her outfit with dark cream slides, and a lighter beige purse worn at her shoulder.

Model Hailey, meanwhile, donned a large and heavy-looking ribbed knit red Comme Des Garcons Supreme sweater that seemed out of place in the extreme Southern California summer heat.

She matched this with a pair of red Kith X MISBHV biker shorts.

On her feet, the niece of Alec Baldwin and cousin of Ireland Baldwin wore black and white Nike sneakers.

Earlier this month, Kendall was seen with her new beau Devin Booker, 23, in Idaho on a brief vacation with Justin and Hailey.

And judging from both of the girls' Instagram feeds, the coronavirus pandemic has not stopped either of them from having a 'dreamy and adventurous' end to the summer, as Hailey put it in a recent post.

And while Kendall only dropped in for a short while in Idaho, Hailey and her husband of nearly two years Justin have traveled extensively in the past months, splitting their time between residences in LA and Canada.

Kendall, meanwhile, has been hitting the town often with her new man Devin, an NBA All Star player.

They were recently seen dining at the Soho House in Malibu, and she has also frequently been spotted at popular celeb hangout Nobu, also in Malibu. 

In June, Kendall and Devin were seen getting into the same SUV as they left a dinner date at Nobu. Prior to this they allegedly embarked on a road trip to Arizona in April.
