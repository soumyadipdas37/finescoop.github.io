Schitt's Creek after sweeping the comedy categories Sunday at the 72nd annual Emmy Awards became the toast of the town and the Internet.

The Pop TV sitcom won the first seven awards during the virtual awards show hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, 52, and became the first comedy series to sweep the four main acting categories in a single year. as well as the first series to win all seven major awards in a single year. 

'I don't know about you, but I've had enough of this Canadian stuff. The Canadians have won all the Emmys tonight. ...Canada only has like 200 people in it, as of tonight, one out of four living Canadians has an Emmy Award,' Jimmy joked after the sitcom culminated its run with the award for Outstanding Comedy Series.

Canadian sitcom: Jimmy Kimmel teased Schitt's Creek on Sunday after it swept the comedy categories at the Emmy Awards, joking it was just short of trading for the Stanley Cup

'Schitt's Creek won seven of them, unfortunately they fell just short. This is a killer. If they had won one more Emmy they would've been able to trade them in for this, a Stanely Cup,' he joked while standing next to the National Hockey League championship trophy.

'But they didn't so we're going to keep it here for another 27 years. Sorry, Canada,' Jimmy added.

Social media also took notice of the show sweeping the comedy categories.

'Schitt's Creek just won the Pats-Seahawks game,' tweeted ESPN reporter and anchor Michele Steele, 41, referencing the Sunday Night Football game between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks.

The sitcom won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series after beating out Curb Your Enthusiasm, Dead To Me, The Good Place, Insecure, The Kominsky Method, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and What We Do in the Shadows.

Creators and father-son duo Eugene, 73, and Dan Levy, 37, accepted the honor together as the son took time to urge viewers to vote.

Dan said: 'Oh, boy. Our show at its core is about the transformational effects of love and acceptance. We need it now more than ever before. If you have not registered to vote, please do so, and then go out and vote. That's the only way we need love and acceptance out there. Dad, do the rest of the fun stuff, sorry for making this political.'
