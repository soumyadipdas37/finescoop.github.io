Dozens of easyJet passengers have been forced to quarantine for 14 days after they were put into a hotel in Spain when their flight from Gibraltar was delayed. 

The passengers would have been able to avoid quarantine had the flight gone ahead as planned because the British Overseas Territory is on the UK's 'safe list'. 

But due to poor weather their flight on Monday was rescheduled and they needed overnight accommodation. 

But all hotel rooms in Gibraltar were full so they had to find their own hotel room, fend for themselves or accept the airline's offer of hotel rooms in Spain.

Passengers who had no other option but to accept the airline's offer were then forced to make their own way across the border into Spain - a coronavirus hotspot.   

That meant they would be forced to quarantine for two weeks when they finally got back to the UK yesterday. 

One passenger, Charlie Markham, 22, told The Sun: 'EasyJet bussed everyone over to Spain for the night and now they're going to be mixing with people on the flight back who were safe in Gibraltar.'

At the end of last week there were only 31 active coronavirus cases in Gibraltar whereas Spain recorded 8,000 new infections on Friday alone. 

It was removed from the UK's safe travel corridor last month.

Basil Pru, of Surrey, was among those taken to Cadiz and told the news site: 'We hear a few are going to keep it hush-hush because they don't want to isolate.'

An easyJet spokesman said: 'As a result of low visibility weather conditions in Gibraltar easyJet had to delay flight EZY8906 to Gatwick overnight.  

'We tried to provide as many hotel rooms in Gibraltar as possible however, due to a shortage of rooms it was not possible to provide these for all customers so we offered accommodation in Spain for those who wanted it. 

'Some customers found accommodation themselves in Gibraltar and easyJet will reimburse the cost to them.

'Whilst the delay was outside of our control, we would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused as a result of the weather.'
