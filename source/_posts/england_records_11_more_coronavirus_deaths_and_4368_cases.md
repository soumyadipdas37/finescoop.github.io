Britain today recorded another 4,368 coronavirus cases and 11 more deaths as Britain stands on the brink of being hit by tougher policies to halt the rapid growth of the outbreak.

Department of Health figures show slightly fewer than 4,000 new infections are now being recorded each day, on average — up from 2,998 last Monday and 2,032 the week before that. 

And government statistics reveal 22 Britons are now succumbing to the life-threatening illness daily. By contrast, the rolling seven-day average stood at between 11 and 12 just a week ago.   

Cases have soared to the highest levels since May over the past three weeks but deaths have only started to follow suit in the past week because infected patients can take weeks to die from the disease.

It comes as Sir Patrick Vallance today warned the UK faces 50,000 new daily cases of coronavirus by the middle of October and more than 200 deaths everyday by November, if the spread of Covid-19 is not brought under control.

 Professor Chris Whitty also admitted the UK has 'in a bad sense literally turned a corner' and the nation needs to view the fight against the virus as a 'six month problem' before science eventually can 'ride to our rescue'.

Boris Johnson will convene an emergency Cobra committee meeting tomorrow morning before revealing his new lockdown plans, which could include an enforcement blitz on pubs and restaurants.

It comes as Boris Johnson will convene an emergency Cobra committee meeting tomorrow morning before revealing his new lockdown plans after the Government's two top scientists warned there will be more than 200 deaths a day by November if the UK fails to slow the spread of coronavirus.

The Prime Minister is said to be meeting with senior ministers this afternoon to thrash out the final details of his proposals amid claims they will include an enforcement blitz on pubs and restaurants which allow customers to flout the rule of six.

A Government source told The Sun that police and councils will be told to 'act immediately when they see rules being broken' and that could mean shutting premises which refuse to comply.

Mr Johnson is widely expected to unveil his new crackdown in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons tomorrow lunchtime.

The Prime Minister and his top team are deciding on the next steps in the battle against the disease after Sir Patrick Vallance warned this morning that there will be 50,000 new daily cases of coronavirus by the middle of October and more than 200 deaths everyday by November if the virus is not brought under control.

The Chief Scientific Adviser gave the stark warning as Professor Chris Whitty said the UK has 'in a bad sense literally turned a corner' with rising rates of infection and that the nation needs to view the fight against the virus as a 'six month problem' before science eventually can 'ride to our rescue'.

Many in Westminster believe Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, were 'rolling the pitch' today ahead of Mr Johnson's grand unveiling tomorrow.

The grim numbers and comments from the pair suggest Britons will be hit with new rules on their daily lives in order to stop the growth of the disease in the winter months.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock today insisted that any new lockdown measures 'will be different to last time' but he refused to guarantee that pubs will still be allowed to open this weekend as he said it is socialising which is mainly driving the spike in cases.

Mr Johnson is facing major divisions within his own Cabinet about what to do next amid a tug of war between ministers over protecting the economy.

Mr Hancock and Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove are said to want the PM to take decisive action now while Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel are reportedly advocating a more cautious approach, according to The Times.

Any move to reimpose more stringent restrictions is likely to spark a Tory rebellion after Sir Graham Brady this morning accused Mr Johnson of 'ruling by decree' as he demanded MPs get a vote in the House of Commons on any new measures.
