She's famed for her fit physique thanks to her physically challenging appearances on hit show Dancing With Stars. 

And Julianne Hough gave fans an insight into her training methods on Monday by sharing a snap of herself working out. 

The dancer and actress, 32, showed off her toned body in a colourful crop top and matching hotpants while burning calories on an exercise bike.

Partially exposing her cleavage, Julianne flashed a peace sign while exercising in what appeared to be a makeshift home fitness studio. 

The American star had evidently worked up a sweat during the gym session, and she revealed a flushed complexion worked on her cardio. 

Julianne previously took to her Instagram Story with a glimpse at her morning routine, which included lemon water, 'morning pages,' breathwork, meditation and an obligatory workout.

She shared her 'September Morning Pages Challenge' with her 4.9million Instagram followers earlier this week, challenging them to write down whatever's on their mind as soon as they wake up.

The Burlesque actress also posted to her stories later on Monday as she got to work in the studio with her Kinrgy crew.

She said in a behind-the-scenes video: 'We are here. We've got one more class that I'm teaching this week. And then we'll be back on Tuesday.'

Julianne also posted a video to her profile, as she lied down on a heating pad, while her crew piled on top of her.

She wrote: 'When @biomatprofessionals so good all the @kinrgy guides want in! We’ve been hard at work in the studio this week recording some new and exciting stuff for you guys, and the BioMat has been saving our booties (literally) with it’s muscle relaxing technology and Far Infrared Ray heat.

'(All Covid-19 guidelines and protocols are being followed in our studio. Team members have their temperatures checked upon arrival and personnel behind the camera are required to wear masks)'

The Dancing with the Stars alum launched her holistic movement experience earlier this year, and has been offering virtual classes amid COVID-19.

She told Us Weekly in May: 'With so much uncertainty in the world today, it’s easy to feel a bit lost and isolated.

'Now more than ever, people are searching for deeper human connections, and at its core the Kinrgy philosophy guides us to our inner knowing, that it all starts from within.'
