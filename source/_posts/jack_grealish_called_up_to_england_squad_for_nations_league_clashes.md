Jack Grealish has been handed his first England call-up as the FA confirmed Marcus Rashford and Harry Winks have withdrawn from the squad to face Iceland and Denmark.

Grealish was a surprise omission from the original squad following his brilliant form for Aston Villa last season.

But Rashford's withdrawal has opened the door to the Villa skipper to meet up with the senior set-up for the first time.

Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has withdrawn from Gareth Southgate's side

Grealish was initially left out of the Three Lions squad with Southgate favouring in-form Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood.

'With Jack, the simple answer is Mason Greenwood,' the England boss said last week.

'He's competing in my view against Greenwood, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Raheem Sterling. 

The FA confirmed Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks has also pulled out of Three Lions side

'I know Villa have played him as an eight but I don't see him in that role for us.

'He could play as a 10 but we haven't played with a 10. Also some of those other players I've talked about would be very good 10s as well. He's a talent, there's no doubt about that. 

'But I think Mason Greenwood's performances, his goalscoring ability and maturity was impossible to leave out.'

Rashford was expected to pull out with an ankle injury, a problem he has been carrying since the end of last season.

Tottenham midfielder Winks was forced to pull out of the squad on Monday. The FA have not confirmed the reason why.

The withdrawals have arrived amid a worrying Covid-19 outbreak within the Premier League since the end of last season.

Sportsmail knows of at least four players who have tested positive recently - developments the FA have been fully aware.

Manager Gareth Southgate was fearing the worst but two drop-outs was the best scenario he could have hoped for given the rise in cases among top-flight footballers.
