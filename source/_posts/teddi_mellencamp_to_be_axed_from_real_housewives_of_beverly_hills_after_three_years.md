Teddi Mellencamp will not be returning to the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal.

The 39-year-old daughter of rocker John Mellencamp has been on the show for three seasons after joining in 2017. The 10th season came to a close earlier this week with the final reunion show. 

An insider at Bravo has told DailyMail.com: 'Teddi will be advised this week that she will not be picked up for another season.

'The network has not been impressed with her performance on the show. They considered cutting her last season but gave her one last chance.’

Bad news: Teddi Mellencamp is being let go from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Dailymail.com can exclusively reveal 

'She is boring and stale and does not offer anything to the franchise with her robotic and staged delivery when interacting with the other cast members.'

'The issue is, the other cast members don't particularly like her and beyond Kyle no one is friends with her.

'Kyle will most likely dump her, when Bravo does.'

It seems that Teddi's off-camera pursuits have also raised questions about her suitability to be on the show. 

'She is boring and stale and does not offer anything to the franchise with her robotic and staged delivery when interacting with the other cast members.' the insider said

'The network has not been impressed with her performance on the show' the source added. She is seen here with Brandi Glanvill in the most recent season 10

The mother-of-three defended her All In weight loss program in an Instagram video posted Tuesday, after receiving criticism over the program's restrictive nature and alleged aggressive nature of the brand's coaches.

The insider added: 'The network has been less than impressed with the war she is in with influential Instagrammer Emily Gellis.

'It is concerning that she is pushing a business that young women, Bravo's key audience, are claiming is unhealthy and downright dangerous.'

The Bravo insider said 'It is concerning that she is pushing a business that young women, Bravo's key audience, are claiming is unhealthy and downright dangerous.'

'Regardless of how much Teddi begs to keep her job when she is told, the network will not change their mind. She's done.'

Alleged former clients of Teddi's program have come forward with their experiences, shared by Gellis, claiming that they were initially restricted to approximately 500 calories while being required to do a daily hour of cardio. 

The program, which prides itself on 'accountability' has four different levels starting with a two-week Jumpstart plan before clients can move to the Monthly program, Weight and Workout and then maintenance.

According to the site, it costs $599 for the two-week Jumpstart program, $399 for the monthly program, $165 for the Weight and Workout program and $95 for a Maintenance program. 

All In also offers a postpartum plan, that Teddi has advertised on her own social media after welcoming her daughter Dove six months ago.

A registered dietitian messaged Gellis asking her followers to 'report' All In to the 'dietics licensing board in their state,' claiming that the program was 'violating licensing laws and causing harm from nutrition coaching.' 

The influencer wrote a post herself saying 'Not one medical professional has messaged me saying this diet is OK.'
