A woman has shared her ingenious hack to heat up cold food while stuck in hotel quarantine without a microwave. 

Nat Chancellor arrived from overseas ready to undertake her mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine in Rydges Southbank in Brisbane. 

Nat Chancellor revealed she used a hairdryer to heat up her food while stuck in hotel quarantine

Some of the food delivered to Ms Chancellor was shared to Facebook

But with no microwave available, Ms Chancellor had to think laterally.

When the time came to re-heat the meal, she wrapped it in aluminium foil and placed it in an insulated bag.

A video she shared online showed her then unzipping a small section of the insulated bag, and put the end of her hairdryer in the gap.

On her online post she said 'it actually worked' but added that she 'didn’t do it for long and turned it off a couple of times' for fear of melting the container or overcooking the food. 

Social media users were in awe at the bizarre technique but thanked Ms Chancellor for sharing it.

'The good to come out of quarantine! Ppl getting more inventive & thinking outside of the box,' one person wrote.

'Brilliant idea,' another wrote. 

'I reckon you could use an iron to heat up a toastie. Just an idea!' someone else joked, referencing the oft-used hack. 

Australians returning from overseas are required to undertake 14-days of mandatory hotel quarantine to control the spread of COVID-19.
