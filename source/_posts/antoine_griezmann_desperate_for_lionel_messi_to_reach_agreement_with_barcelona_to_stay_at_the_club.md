Antoine Griezmann has expressed his desire for Lionel Messi to stay at Barcelona.

Messi's future at Barcelona remains unresolved after he submitted a transfer request, and Griezmann admitted that he doesn't have any inside information about whether his exalted team-mate will stay.  

As reported by Mundo Deportivo, Griezmann said: 'We try to have news, but what happens is between the club and him. We just hope he stays. We listen to a bit of everything but we don't know more on our part'.

Messi and his father Jorge have been in discussions with Barcelona but it remains to be seen whether the 33-year-old will stay at the club. 

There is a possibility that he could see out the final year of his contract at the Nou Camp before leaving on a free transfer in 2021.

New Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman is tasked with overhauling the club's squad

The future of the Argentina superstar is just one issue that Barcelona have to address ahead of the new campaign, with new manager Ronald Koeman tasked with overhauling the squad.

Ivan Rakitic has already left for Sevilla, while Messi's close friend Luis Suarez is another player who could depart.

Barcelona are eager to respond following a hugely disappointing 2020-21 campaign which ended without them winning a trophy and included a harrowing 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.
