Wayne Rooney's neighbours have applied for permission to keep 1,000 Australian sheep next door to his £20million Cheshire mansion.  

Brighouse Farms, next door to the ex-England footballer's new home, has revealed plans for two sheds with a combined floor size of 1,886 sq m.

In plans submitted to Cheshire East Council, the expert breeders also want to build a dark-room laboratory 'used for the handling and storage of sheep semen and embryos for artificial insemination' right by the six-bed mansion. 

Ironically, Rooney - who needs to listen to the sound of a Hoover to get to sleep - is a player-coach at Derby County, known as the Rams. 

Cheshire East Council will decide on the application at the end of next month.

The planning documents state: 'The buildings have been designed to be within keeping of other modern buildings in the surrounding areas of Cheshire.

'It is essential that the sheep are housed during certain periods within the year, this includes during lambing and also during service.

'The hay which is produced on the land needs to be stored immediately following harvest to ensure that the quality does not deteriorate.' 

The proposals also explain the farmers' experience in the high-tech breeding programme, which goes on next to the Rooneys' manor.

 'Mrs Brighouse combines her qualities and farming experience with her scientific approach to the frequent lambing system,' they state.

The plans say the biosecurity of the site, a stone's throw from Rooney's own shed which he has built to store tractors, will be maintained

MailOnline previously reported how builders returned to work on the Cheshire home in May after construction came to a halt because of coronavirus.

The huge six-bedroom country house, which has already taken three years to build, has been mocked for looking like an out-of-town Morrisons supermarket.

Work on the 40-acre estate near Knutsford stopped in April due to concerns around building supply deliveries as lockdown restrictions came into full force.

A football pitch has been built on the site, and the home will have its own orangery, snooker room with bar, cinema and swimming pool. 

 Rooney is also having a security system installed, as well as an underground tunnel and a bunker where he will keep a getaway electric car. 

Safety precautions are being taken after the footballer's family suffered an attempted burglary at their old home in 2016 while Rooney was playing a match.

Robert McNamara from Scarborough, North Yorkshire admitted attempting to enter as a trespasser with intent to steal on August 3, 2016. The former serviceman was jailed for two years and eight months.

Rooney and Coleen reportedly paid a Cheshire property £4million to build their dream three-storey mansion in 2017, kitted out with state-of-the-art security features 

 Rooney and Coleen reportedly paid a Cheshire property £4million to build their dream three-storey mansion in 2017, kitted out with state-of-the-art security features.

Shortly after acquiring the plot, they entered a 22-month long planning row with locals who objected to the building of a farmer's shed to house and tractor and hay bales. The dispute was settled in Rooney's favour.

Neighbours also objected to a 9ft security fence which they claimed was an eyesore that would 'urbanise' the countryside. Again, they were overruled in Rooney's favour.

The ex-Premier League star's bunker will apparently have CCTV, a kitchen and a toilet for a guard and a secure pick-up area, according to The Sun. 

The mansion has a subterranean basement home to a steam room, plunge pool, hot tub, cinema room with 10 seats, wine cellar and snooker room with bar. It will also include a patio, landscaped gardens, a luxury car garage and a stable block.
