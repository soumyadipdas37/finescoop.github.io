Being a contestant on The Bachelor may may seem like a fairytale - but producers and former contestants say otherwise.

Multiple sources have told Daily Mail Australia that the Channel 10 dating show isn't half as glamorous as it appears on TV.

One insider said that this year's season was 'a f**king punish' for the production team at Warner Bros. because the cast wasn't up to scratch.

'Producers couldn't stand most of the girls,' the source said.

They added: 'They just wanted to be on the show to become famous. Some were fame hungry, some had dreams to become actors and others were there for clout.'

According to the source, producers worked overtime to convince Locky Gilbert to keep the few entertaining and engaging women in the mansion.

They were banking on Areeba Emmanuel being the main villain, but after she was sent home they tried to groom Juliette Herrera to be the 'house b**ch'.

'They wanted [Juliette] to be the new villain but she was too nice! Instead of being bossy, she was the one getting pushed around,' the insider said. 

Another source alleged that many of the producers started to 'hate their jobs' after hearing rumours that Locky already knew contestant Bella Varelis before the show. 

The crew apparently felt this made the competition unfair, although both Locky and Bella have denied having any sort of pre-existing relationship.

Producers 'control everything'

Nadine Kodsi, who was eliminated at the first rose ceremony, previously told Daily Mail Australia the show was 'rigged' and that Locky was just a 'puppet' being controlled by the producers.

She also alleged that he received instructions via an earpiece; however, this is not uncommon for reality shows like The Bachelor.

Many contestants are recruited via social media instead of applying 

Daily Mail Australia understands that online applications are only one part of the casting process, and that social media and 'street' casting are also widely used. 

Contestants are scouted at restaurants, nightclubs and bars, with Coogee Pavilion in Sydney being considered a 'hotspot' for talent scouts.

The women are usually approached by casting producers, before agreeing to meet for coffee. It's not until later that the formal auditions and background checks begin.

Others are simply messaged via social media, with contestant Kristina Abramoff saying: 'I was approached by Instagram DM to come to the audition.'

Hectic filming schedules

The first cocktail party is filmed over several nights for as long as 12 hours at a time. 

Some of the women end up getting drunk simply out of boredom and find themselves saying things they regret on camera.

One contestant, rumoured to be Zoe-Clare McDonald, actually passed out before the rose ceremony was filmed.

Secret hiding places in the mansion

Carlin Sterritt, who appeared on last year's season of The Bachelorette, recently said there were a few places in the mansion that were hidden from cameras.

'There's the orchard, the secret place you can go to for chats and stuff... Angie and I kissed [there] at so many cocktail parties,' he said. 'But obviously they didn't show it.'

He claimed that Locky would most likely be doing the same.

'If you're wondering, yes, Locky is macking on with many girls at the cocktail parties. It's happening. 100 per cent,' he said.

Social media ban 

The contestants on The Bachelor are not allowed to use Instagram, Facebook or Twitter until they have been sent home.

Their social media activity is then carefully monitored by Channel 10 and Warner Bros. until their elimination has aired on television.

If the women share unsanctioned content, they face potential legal consequences.
