Crystal Palace welcome Southampton to Selhurst Park in this afternoon's Premier League action as Danny Ings looks for another outstanding season for visitors.

The Saints forward will be the clear dangerman after scoring 22 league goals last season and should be a handful for Roy Hodgson's side, who are hoping to push the reset button after a terrible end to the 2019-20 campaign. 

Palace lost seven games in a row during the restart before stopping the rot by drawing 1-1 with Tottenham in the finale, and the veteran manager will be confident that the only way is up as they start on zero points.   

Sportsmail's KIERAN JACKSON will provide live coverage of Palace vs Southampton including live score, lineups and build-up.
