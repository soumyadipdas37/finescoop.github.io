Emily, who was noticeably braless, looked ultra chic in an iridescent burgundy jacket and a pair of matching trousers.

The statement making two piece featured white stitching and silver buttons up the front of the jacket. 

The Inamorata CEO looked to be wearing minimal makeup and she had a pair of brown cateye shades over her eyes.

She accessorized her looked with her go-to pair of chunky gold hoop earrings.

In order to deter the spread of COVID-19, Emily had on a black cloth mask that she briefly pulled down in order to speak to her husband.

Sebastian opted to go mask-free and he could be seen holding onto Colombo's leash as the curious pup sniffed the green grass.

The film producer looked ultra casual in pair of green shorts and a bright white graphic tee.

They caught a flight out of JFK in April, shortly after the CDC issued an advisory, asking 'residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.'

However, in late June as COVID-19 cases spiked dramatically in California, Emily and Sebastian crossed back to New York.

Despite COVID-19 still running rampant, Ratajkowski has been providing fashion inspiration during her frequent outings in the city.
