His ex wife Lisa Armstrong recently left his unwanted belongings out on the street.

And Ant McPartlin appeared in good spirits as he enjoyed a date night with his girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett on Saturday.

The couple put on a loved-up display as they held hands while arriving at Amazonico restaurant in Mayfair. 

Couple: Ant McPartlin, 44, appeared in good spirits as he enjoyed a date night with his girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett, 43, on Saturday

Ant, 44, arrived at the venue in a navy jumper with a matching blazer along with a pair of tan trousers.

The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! host completed his look for the evening with a pair of white sneakers.

Anne-Marie, 43, cut an elegant figure in a black midi dress with a pleated detail and a sweetheart neckline.

Ant's other half, who met the star while working as his personal assistant, added height to her frame with a pair of gold heels.

Anne-Marie wrapped up in a black leather jacket and styled her blonde locks into loose curls.

It comes after Lisa said a final goodbye to her ex-husband as she left out his unwanted possessions in the street for her neighbours to take.

No doubt the items were no longer wanted by the TV presenter so Lisa made sure they went to a good home instead.

The make-up artist, 43, placed the goods in boxes marked 'help yourself' and put them outside her west London property as she prepares to move out of the marital home she formerly shared with her ex.

The items were easily identifiable as Ant's because they included his Newcastle United shirts and a 'Team Ant' foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway.

There was also Ant's old dressing gown and a pile of board games.

No longer needed was Piers Morgan’s book The Insider and Lisa threw in her own Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales from the Dance Floor - she is Strictly's head make-up artist.

Lisa, who received £31 million in her divorce settlement from Ant, was also throwing out a bowl used by labrador, Hurley, as well as a Banksy artwork calendar and a Jamie Oliver book.

A source told The Sun that Lisa is leaving her West London house and wanted a 'big clear out.'

They added: 'Ant had already sifted through what he wanted to keep and had gophers collect them in recent weeks.

'What was left is being offered for free. His bathrobe has been taken. Footie memorabilia has also been given away. But it was the end for his Newcastle shirts.'

Another source said: 'Some of it is Ant’s, some of it is Lisa’s and some of it they bought together.'

On Tuesday, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said he did not agree with Lisa's decision to throw out these possessions, even though she is divorced.

He was particularly astonished to see she had thrown out his book.

Piers told co-host Susanna Reid and the audience: 'Ant McPartlin’s ex Lisa Armstrong – who is a wonderful makeup artist, she does my makeup on Life Stories.

'And I thought we were friends. I really did. I was quite friendly with Ant. Apparently this is stuff that Ant himself didn’t want back.

'These are the unwanted items that neither of them ever wanted to see again. There were things you’d expect, like Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales From the Dancefloor. Wholly understandable.

'His Newcastle shirt. I wouldn’t want to keep them either. A Team Ant foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway. Again, why would you want that?

'So you have all these things – and in the middle of it, you have a copy of my book, The Insider.' 

Later on in the show, Piers said Lisa had contacted him to apologise.

She told him: '"Oh my god, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t even there. I haven’t even see that book. Are you mad at me?"’ Yes – I am mad at you. No, I just want my book back!'

Lisa split from Ant in 2018 after 12 years of marriage, and is now reported to be dating James Green.

Lisa and Ant finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 following the presenter's highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol.

The Saturday Night Takeaway star has continued his relationship with his former personal assistant and girlfriend of two years, Anne-Marie.

However last month Lisa appeared to confirm that she was dating her new lover James, after fans reached out on Twitter to congratulate her on the happy news.

Meanwhile, Lisa has named her new cosmetics range after the pals who supported her following her split from Ant.
