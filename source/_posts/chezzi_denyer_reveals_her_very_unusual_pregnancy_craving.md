She is expecting her third child with her husband, popular TV host Grant Denyer.

And Chezzi Denyer's pregnancy cravings have really kicked in.

The 41-year-old revealed that she is constantly sucking on sour squirms to keep her energy levels up.

Sweet and sour: Chezzi Denyer has revealed her very unusual pregnancy craving after announcing her third pregnancy 

The mother-of-two posted about her strange hankering for the sweet treat on Tuesday, and said she has been devouring the lollies because she's struggling to eat other foods.

'When a bag of sour lollies can make you this excited!' she wrote.

'I heard Chrissy Teigen ate so many sour lollies she burnt her tongue - OUCH. I’m finding sucking on them helps give me a bit of energy and for some reason the sour taste I adore right now!

Chezzi went on to explain how her cravings have changed throughout all her three pregnancies.

Chezzi and Grant already proud parents to daughters Scout and Sailor, eight. 

baby makes five! Grant and Chezzi announced their exciting pregnancy news last month. 'We have some exciting news... coming 1 March 2021,' the couple wrote on respective Instagram accounts

'With Sailor I craved (and ate by the truckload) tons of condensed milk with cocoa powder and desiccated coconut!' she wrote.

With Scout I had strong urges to devour (which I did late late late in the pregnancy) tall glasses of ice chocolates with towers of cream �� and I don’t like milk. I only take soy milk cause I can’t stand the taste of dairy??

And with this bub I’m going to enjoy any cravings! I’ve been feeling so miserable and revolting... totally gagging thinking about food.. that anything that tickles my fancy I.e sour lollies I’m going to enjoy guilt free!

Grant recently revealed adorable name his four-year-old daughter, Scout, had suggested for her sibling.

When asked by Sunday Project host Lisa Wilkinson how he was feeling about having another child, Grant said his household was 'buzzing' with excitement.

'The Denyer household is really buzzing at the moment. The siblings are so excited,' said the Dancing with the Stars presenter.

'Scout, who is four, has already decided to name the newborn, and she's going to call it Watermelon Sugar,' he added, seemingly in reference to the Harry Styles song.
