Sydney's famous Opera House will reopen its doors as coronavirus restrictions continue to ease across New South Wales.

The Australian landmark is set to welcome the public back from November 2 to coincide with a collection of new shows. 

The new initiative dubbed New Work Now will feature 15 local productions in place of international acts which were meant to be showing.

Sydney Opera House CEO Louise Herron said thanks to a massive $1million donation by private supporters, partners and staff, New Work Now will reflect on how the virus affected the arts industry and forced the venue to shut six months ago. 

'When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Australia in March, live performances largely ceased, with unprecedented impacts on artists, arts workers and audiences,' Ms Herron said.

'New Work Now responds directly to these challenges by commissioning local artists to create and present new works.'

Ms Herron said she had the 'deepest gratitude' for supporters who stood by the venue while it was shut.

'As a cultural icon and symbol of Australia, the Opera House is committed to inspiring and strengthening the community through everything we do.'

New Work Now will feature classical and contemporary music, First Nations, talks and ideas, contemporary performance, children and families, and digital works.

The first live performance, CRUSH, by the Helpmann Award-winning Australian company Branch Nebula, will hit the stage in November.

The group has been working on pressure, vacuum, gravity, magnetism – and slimy stuff which will be incorporated in their performance.

This will then be followed by Indigenous World Art Orchestra, global collaboration involving First Nations performers, composers and musicians that tells true stories of the first contact on occupied territories around the world. 

Sydney Chamber Opera – Diary of One Who Disappeared, commissioned by Professor Ross Steele AM

A new production of Diary of One Who Disappeared by Czech composer Leoš Janáček (1854-1928). Janáček's hauntingly beautiful song cycle questions the romantic ideal that the love of another person can rescue us from the suffering and mundanity of our existence. The world premiere will be presented as part of the Opera House’s digital season From Our House to Yours on 10 October.

CRUSH – by artists Lee Wilson, Mirabelle Wouters, Mickie Quick and Phil Downing

Part DIY shed, part Medieval research centre, part obsessive Bunnings shopping spree, CRUSH blows up the boundaries of the physical body and mind. Helpmann Award winning Australian company Branch Nebula artists Lee Wilson, Mirabelle Wouters, Mickie Quick and Phil Downing have been in the lab, fixated on phenomena like pressure, vacuum, gravity, magnetism – and slimy, gloopy stuff. Prepare to be stunned as if you are catapulted across the stage in this gripping new physical performance. The work will be presented in late 2020.

Indigenous World Art Orchestra

A global collaboration involving First Nations performers, composers and musicians that tells true stories of the first contact on occupied territories around the world. Accompanying Vivaldi’s Four Seasons will be original scores with a strong focus on First instruments, traditional rhythms, mother tongues and cultural voices. Reflection on the music and narration of these stories will be shared from a woman’s perspective. The work will be creatively developed in 2020 for production in 2021.

The Bright Side of Bum Town – written by Frieda Lee

This is the story of Madeira Cake and her family living in a post-coronavirus recession. It explores the choice facing many parents: more money and longer working hours but less time to enjoy with your family versus less money and shorter working hours but more time spent with the family. The script will be developed in 2021 and is supported by a partnership with Griffin Theatre Company.
