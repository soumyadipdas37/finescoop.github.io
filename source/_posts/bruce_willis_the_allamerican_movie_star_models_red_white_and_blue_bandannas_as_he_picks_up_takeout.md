Bruce Willis was an all-American movie heartthrob in red white and blue bandannas while out in Los Angeles this Wednesday.

The 65-year-old Die Hard superstar could be spotted picking up some takeout at a Le Pain Quotidien in Beverly Hills.

Wrapping a red and white bandanna around his forehead, he used a blue and white bandanna as a face mask while emerging from lockdown.

Bruce modeled a pair of faded blue jeans and a striped T-shirt, rounding off his California casual ensemble with sneakers.

He has returned to Los Angeles after a period of self-isolation in Idaho with a bubble that included his five daughters and their mothers.

The Pulp Fiction star shares his three elder daughters Rumer, 32, Scout, 29, and Tallulah, 26 with his ex-wife Demi Moore.

Bruce also has two little ones called Mabel, eight, and Evelyn, six, with his current wife Emma Heming who is more than two decades his junior.

Despite the coronavirus lockdowns Bruce has had two movie releases this year, Hard Kill which came out in August and Survive The Night which bowed in May.

Hard Kill stars Bruce opposite Desperate Housewives dreamboat Jesse Metcalfe and also features Vanderpump Rules diva Lala Kent.

One of the producers of the film was Lala's fiance Randall Emmett, and earlier this month she announced she is expecting their baby.

Meanwhile Survive The Night starred Bruce alongside blond bombshell Chad Michael Murray of One Tree Hill fame.

Both films were directed by Matt Eskandari and were savaged by critics - Survive The Night has 15% on Rotten Tomatoes and Hard Kill has 0%.
