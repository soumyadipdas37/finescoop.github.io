She's been trying to stay sane while quarantining throughout the coronavirus pandemic at her Los Angeles home.

And January Jones opened up to her fans after she was feeling down in the dumps in an Instagram video posted Tuesday.

The 42-year-old Mad Men star claimed that 'Maris is in retrograde,' which explained why she was feeling low, before she launched into a skincare tutorial for fans.

In the dumps: January Jones, 42, filmed a video while lying on the floor of her closet because she was feeling down due to Mars being in retrograde on Tuesday

'Welcome to the floor of my closet. This is where I go when I'm feeling down, and right now Mars is in retrograde or something and everything in my house is falling apart,' she explained.

'So I wanted to lay here and look at pretty shoes and bags and things. Come up with outfit ideas for when we have the chance to get back into that world.'

January said she wanted to put on 'a dress and jewelry and my eye makeup,' because 'sparkly things cheer me up.'

After having some time to herself in the closet, she decided to make her video a 'four-step process,' with step one being to relax.

January rose up and started walking through her house to give her fans a glimpse into how she keeps her skin so clear.

'Step two is going to be your skin care. Let’s take care of ourselves. Let’s go on a hot date with ourselves.'

She said she used a 'resurfacing moisture mask by True Botanicals' to give herself 'baby skin.'

She followed it up with the brand's repair serum, 'which will make you appear like you’ve been sleeping and drinking tons of water, even if you haven’t.'

The Last Man On Earth star finished up her skin routine with the brand's Pure Radiance Oil for a 'glow up.'

Gorgeous skin: 'Step two is going to be your skin care. Let’s take care of ourselves. Let’s go on a hot date with ourselves,' she said

Imbibing: Step three was to take a sooting bubble bath, and January recommended her fans cool down with a nice beer in a large glass

Odd choice: But step four was to add some beer to the bath. 'I’m doing that because I feel like it’s going to be hydrating for my body, and I recently read about what Cleopatra would put in her baths'

January's third step to relaxing was a soothing bubble bath.

'I put a lot of questionable things in it, and I’m gonna put one more questionable thing in it, which is my step four,' she explained, before revealing that the final step was to enjoy a drink of your choice.

She opted for a hearty beer in a tulip glass, before saying she would pour a bit of it into her bath.

'I’m doing that because I feel like it’s going to be hydrating for my body, and I recently read about what Cleopatra would put in her baths,' she said.

'I just feel like, depending on who you’ve dated, it can’t be that much different, right?' she added, puzzlingly.

She signed off by instructing her fans to 'take care of yourself, date yourself, love yourself.'
