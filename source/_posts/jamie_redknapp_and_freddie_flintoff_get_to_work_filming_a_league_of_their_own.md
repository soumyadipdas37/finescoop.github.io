They're sportsmen, friends and co-stars of Sky series A League Of Their Own.

So it was no surprise to see Jamie Redknapp and Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff kicking back outside the Lowry Hotel in Manchester, where they were filming their show on Friday, during which they bumped into Naga Munchetty.

The BBC news host, 45, greeted the duo, with whom she shares the same management company, fondly from an acceptable social distance outside the hotel.

Sky Sports pundit Jamie, 47, looked stylish in a varsity style bomber jacket while he packed up his car ahead of Freddie leaving the hotel. 

Hot on his heels was the former cricketer, who was looking dashing in a tight polo shirt while his light hair was stylishly mussed. 

Naga went for a low-key look as she donned jeans and an oversized grey jumper adorned with the words 'I'm not for everybody'.  

Her outing comes amid claims she could be banned from speaking about NatWest on BBC Breakfast after appearing in adverts for the bank.

The presenter hosted webinars for the banking giant weeks after she was rebuked for fronting a paid corporate video for car maker Aston Martin.

It has now emerged she could be stopped from speaking about NatWest live on air after bosses rapped her for a 'conflict of interest' which, 'will be kept in mind for future editorial decisions'.

Last month, Jamie spoke about 'nerve-wracking' presenting experience on Sky One's A League of Their Own alongside Freddie and Andy Murray.

The sports columnist explained to Christine Lampard: 'You make it look easy. I must admit there were a few mistakes. I had to go back and do a lot of links. It was fun... 

'It was nerve wracking I must admit. When you've got to present and keep people in check... I enjoyed being the boss for a bit.' 

Shortly before his appearance, Jamie enjoyed a lively chat with Lorraine's stand-in presenter Christine Lampard as they discussed his new ventures last month.

Jamie and the host, 41, were left giggling as they recalled the moment he sang at her wedding with her husband and his cousin Frank, 42, in December 2015.

'You got up and did some singing at my wedding!', the amused broadcaster said, with the former footballer proudly confirming: 'Yeah I did! I had a few too many drinks that night, I think we all did.'

The sportsman cringed as he discussed belting lyrics in front of musician Ed Sheeran, stating: 'Especially as Ed was there, it wasn't a great idea to be singing in front of him! He didn't sign me up, I'll put it that way.'

Jamie also shut down rumours he's set to follow in his father Harry's footsteps by appearing on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!

'Leave it out Christine. No way!', the media personality declared, just under two years after his dad, 73, was crowned King of the Jungle.
