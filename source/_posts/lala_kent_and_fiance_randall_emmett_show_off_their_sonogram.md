They announced her pregnancy last week.

But Lala Kent and her fiance Randall Emmett delighted fans once again with another baby update on Wednesday.

Randall, 49, proudly showed off their sonogram on his Instagram stories on Tuesday, where he cooed over their new addition.  

'There's the baby!' Lala Kent and her fiance Randall Emmett delighted fans once again with another baby update on Wednesday

'There's the baby!' Randall exclaimed as he zoomed into the sonogram, his voice full of joy.

'The baby!' the Vanderpump Rules star chimed in.

The Instagram update comes just days after Lala and her husband-to-be announced her pregnancy on their podcast, Give Them Lala... With Randall.

'I am so excited. I feel very maternal and motherly,' she said. 'I'm like shaking right now, because I can't believe it's a real-life thing. I'm really emotional.'

Lala casually announced the news on the podcast, saying: 'Today is my 30 birthday and I can't think of any other way to celebrate than with you guys coming through your headphones and speakers. I had the best gift given to me, my body also helped out too… I am pregnant!' 

'Lala Kent, a soon-to-be mother!' Randall chimed in.  

Lala and Randall have been open about their desire to have a family together, even revealing they had been attempting to conceive a child during quarantine.

'We are working at that currently,' Emmett told Us Weekly of their baby plans. 

The couple have even begun using technology to help them with their family planning.  

'We are on the Flo app,' Emmett said. 'We are on the apps. Lala, whatever day it is, she comes in, she says, "Give me a baby!" and then I hop right to it.' 

Lala and Randall became engaged in 2018 during a trip to Cabo San Lucas, less than a year before going public with their relationship. 

The couple were set to tie the knot earlier this year, but have been forced to postpone it multiple times due to the coronavirus pandemic.  

Randall already shares daughters daughters London, 10, and six-year-old Rylee with ex-wife, and You actress, Ambyr Childers.
