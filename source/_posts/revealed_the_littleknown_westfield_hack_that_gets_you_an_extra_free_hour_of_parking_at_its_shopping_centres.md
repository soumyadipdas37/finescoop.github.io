A little-known Westfield hack can score shoppers an extra free hour of parking at some of its busiest centres. 

The shopping-centre giant has released an app, Westfield Plus, which gives members a range of perks - including extended free parking.

Selected Westfield centres, including Bondi Junction in Sydney's east, Chermside in Brisbane, Canberra's Woden and Carousel in Perth are all on board.   

Parking is usually only free for the first two hours and then goes up in $5 increments every half-hour.

This means shoppers would usually pay $15 for just over three hours of parking time at the shopping centre, but can now get it for free.

Other centres that offer the extended free parking include Parramatta and Penrith, in Sydney's west, and Chatswood in Sydney's Lower North Shore.

'Get the most out of every visit to Westfield Bondi Junction with our new membership program, Westfield Plus,' the website says.
