She rose to fame after appearing on the fifth season of Love Island.

And Lucie Donlan was sure to set pulses racing as she went out skating in Newquay, Cornwall, during an outing on Tuesday.

The reality star, 21, looked sensational as she showed off her toned abs in a white crop top that she paired with high-waist shorts.

Lucie offset her bright ensemble with a pink plaid shirt that she wore open, while she completed her look with a pair of pink socks and white Converses. 

The blonde beauty wore her golden locks in loose waves that cascaded over her shoulders, and she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion.

She was in good spirits as she showed off her skateboarding skills in a car park, zig-zagging around before going back further up the road to start again.

Her outing comes after Lucie went public with her Love Island beau Luke at the start of July.

Soon after the announcement, Luke branded the surfer his 'partner in crime' in a sweet social media post.

The former heating engineer and the model looked loved-up as they shared a hug on the beach during a romantic surfing trip in Yorkshire.

Luke and Lucie sported matching wetsuits as they put on a cosy display in the image uploaded to the hunk's platform, which he captioned: 'My partner in crime.'

The surfer commented: 'Youuuu' with a heart-eyed emoji, while fellow Love Islander Luke Trotman, who confirmed the pair's romance days earlier, cheekily wrote: 'Double date but no surfing.' (sic) 

Just hours after going Instagram official, the Luke's ex-girlfriend Demi Jones – who he was partnered up with on Love Island's winter 2020 series – appeared to make a thinly-veiled dig at her co-star as she liked a tweet about being 'better off alone'.
