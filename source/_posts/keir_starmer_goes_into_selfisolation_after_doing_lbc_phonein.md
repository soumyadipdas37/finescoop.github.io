Keir Starmer declared he is going into quarantine today after a member of his household showed coronavirus-type symptoms.

The Labour leader announced he is going into self-isolation hours after taking a phone-in in the LBC radio studios. The party has informed the radio station about the situation. 

A Labour spokesman said: 'This morning Keir Starmer was advised to self isolate after a member of his household showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus. The member of his household has now had a test.

'In line with NHS guidelines, Keir will self-isolate while awaiting the results of the test and further advice from medical professionals.'

It is understood Sir Keir has not shown any signs of the disease himself, but will not be speaking in the Commons debate on Brexit later.

During the phone-in, Sir Keir said he supported the Government's new 'Rule of Six' restrictions which came into force today.

He said: 'I do support the 'rule of six'.

'I think you need something simple, easily understood and I think the Government was slow back in February and March to appreciate the problem it was about the face and we can't repeat that error again, so I do support the 'rule of six'.

'We've publicly come out in support of it and I will say, as I said to the Prime Minister I would, as the leader of the Opposition I say to everybody, please follow the Government advice, please follow these rules.'

He added: 'You can make the argument of why not five or why not six or seven – you have to go with a number backed by the science and they say six and I think we should abide by that rule.'

Sir Keir said ministers' 'side of the bargain' was to improve NHS Test and Trace and to ensure more people were self-isolating now that fresh social restrictions had been put in place.
