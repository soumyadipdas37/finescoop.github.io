Bella Hadid was in the mood for some fresh air as she rode a scooter home from dinner with friends on Monday.

The 23-year-old model spent the night out in Manhattan with friends and took in dinner with them at the upscale eatery The Ainsworth.

Though she's best known for her stunning haute couture looks, she toned her ensemble down with some comfortable and casual clothes.

Bella dressed in layers on the chilly night with a long white dress shirt that she left untucked, which had sleeves long enough to swallow up her hands.

She seemed to be getting into the Halloween spirit earlier by wearing an orange sweater over top of it featuring a green-outlined face.

Rather than walking the whole way home or taking the train or a cab, Bella and one of her friends splurged on a Revel scooter, a rentable electric scooter.

The company has mopeds strewn throughout New York City, Miami, Austin, San Francisco, Oakland and Washington, D.C.

Customers can reserve a nearby scooter through an app, then pay $1 to unlock and 35 cents for each minute they're riding.

Service was temporarily suspended in New York City over the summer after two people were killed in scooter crashes.

Bella left the driving to her friend, but she was prepared with a black helmet, while her pal wore a blue graphic design.

The two seemed to be in a great mood, and Bella jokingly lifted her legs up while her friend stuck her tongue out playfully while they were stopped at an intersection.

The catwalk star struck a more somber tone on Sunday as she joined many of her fellow Americans in remember the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Bella shared a stylish black and white photo of the legal icon, who died Friday at age 87 of complications from pancreatic cancer. 

'... rest in power to the most high RGB,' she wrote, before urging her fans to sign a petition urging that her Supreme Court seat not be filled before inauguration day.

'If this was her last wish , I only hope we can fulfill it for her,' she continued, before reposting the words of former President Barack Obama.
