Giant queues formed outside Costco stores today as panic-buyers raced to bulk-buy essentials like toilet roll and tinned goods on the day tighter coronavirus restrictions were announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Supermarket shelves aross Britain have been emptied of pasta, rice and flour as desperate Britons prepare to hunker down at home for a second lockdown. 

It comes as the Prime Minister made a speech in the House of Commons announcing tightened coronavirus restrictions.

The frenzied buying has echoes of the empty shelves seen in March as shoppers stocked up on essential items ahead of the first nationwide lockdown

The new restrictions, announced by Boris Johnson in a speech at the House of Commons, include:

Amid growing concern that a second lockdown is on the way, shoppers have been emptying supermarket shelves of essential items.   

Toilet rolls, frozen food and long-life produce was wiped from the shelves in some stores in scenes familiar to March before lockdown was announced.

Wholesale shop Costco was inundated with customers with stores in Leeds, London and Manchester seeing a surge in visitors. 

Many stores had to erect barriers to regulate the growing queues, and shoppers were seen leaving with overflowing trollies as they stocked up on supplies. 

As customers flooded social media with pictures of empty aisles, one shopper declared: 'It's happening again.'

Another wrote on Twitter: 'Masks, toilet paper, pasta, flour, bread and fresh meat. Queues at supermarkets for the above and empty shelves.' 

But shoppers have been urged to restrain themselves from panic-buying, with retailers insisting there is not need for it. 

Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said yesterday: 'We urge consumers to be considerate of others and shop as they normally would.'

He played down the presence of panic-buying and paid tribute to the 'excellent job' of retailers to provide food during the pandemic.

Reassuring the public, he added: 'Supply chains are stronger than ever before and we do not anticipate any issues in the availability of food or other goods under any future lockdown.'

But supermarkets are bolstering security at their doors and have doubled the number of delivery slots.

'When the panic buying started months ago, we hadn't experienced it. We are prepared now.' 

Another tweeted today: ' I just finished my shift at work and witnessed so many customers panic buying again. Please don’t - there is no need for it!' 

It comes as Morrisons announced it will be reinstating marshals at its doors to limit the number of shoppers coming in and out, while also reminding them to wear face masks.

Shoppers have shared their concern on Twitter about fears of a second wave of coronavirus fuelling the return of panic-buying, which was seen at the beginning of the crisis in March

An ASDA shopper said: 'This is our ASDA it's madness and as you say even though they are staying open.'

And another person predicted that 'It's happening again'.

Tesco's weekly ordering capacity has risen from 600,000 to 1.5million - but it remains fully booked until Wednesday.

There are three-day waiting times for Ocado, while Sainsbury's is experiencing high demand. 

Sainsbury's revealed the number of Christmas pudding searches was four times higher than this time last year.

The online supermarkets pasted notices on their 'pick a slot' page warning customers the sites were experiencing high demand.

Ocado's read: 'Delivery slots are selling out faster than usual. If you can't find a slot now, please use the 'Next 3 days' button to see available slots further in advance.' 

A notice on Sainsbury's delivery slots page said: 'Slots are still in high demand. We have been working hard to expand our service.  More slots are now available and we are able to offer some of them to other customers. 

'Customers who are vulnerable will get priority access and are able to book slots in advance of anyone else. We're releasing new slots regularly so please check back if you can't see any available.'

On Saturday, Tesco was fully booked until Wednesday with an available slots all priced at £5.50 - and there were no available spaces until Monday at Asda.

The graphic above shows the break down of what Britons spent their cash on in the supermarkets when panic buying started back in March

The Prime Minister is now threatening to 'intensify' coronavirus restrictions as he blames the British public for the rise in cases - despite his repeated pleas for people to return to their desks and eat out at pubs and restaurants in a bid to resuscitate Britain's economy. 

Government scientists have spooked Boris Johnson with warnings of hundreds of daily coronavirus deaths 'within weeks' as they said: 'There is no alternative to a second national lockdown.' 

Mr Johnson looks to ditch his Rule of Six and introduce fortnight-long 'circuit breakers' nationwide for six months, following claims that it was 'inevitable' that a second wave would hit the country.

The new approach to get the UK through winter would see it alternate periods of stricter measures, including bans on all social contact between households and shutting down hospitality and leisure venues like bars and restaurants, with intervals of relaxation. Schools will be shut as a 'last resort', a Whitehall source claimed.
