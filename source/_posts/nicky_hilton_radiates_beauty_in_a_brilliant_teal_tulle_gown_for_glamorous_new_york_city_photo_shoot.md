Nicky flaunted her golden tan in the strapless dress which featured a crystal encrusted neckline.

Layers of heavy teal tulle hid her fantastic frame, and draped down past her feet into a long train.

She added inches to her statuesque frame with a pair of silver strappy heels with a black ribbon tied around her ankle.¬†

Her platinum blonde tresses were parted toward the side and worn in loose waves which rested across her shoulders.

Hilton's glam was simple yet stunning with a focus on her flawless complexion through peach blush and highlight.

At one point between shots, Nicky donned a protective blue face mask to protect herself and others from COVID-19.¬†

Nicky recently celebrated her fifth wedding anniversary to husband James Rothschild. The couple have two children together: Lily, four and Teddy, two.

Like many celebrities as of recent, Hilton took to Instagram to encourage her followers to get to the polls and participate in the upcoming elections.

Nicky rocked a custom 'vote' Shabbyforme bracelet to match her bright blue eyes and wrote: 'Your daily reminder to register to #VOTE!'
