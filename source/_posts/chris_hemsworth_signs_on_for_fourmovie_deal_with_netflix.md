'It looks like it is going to be Netflix's biggest feature film of all time, which is absolutely mind-blowing and we are blown away by the response and the support,' gushed Chris in a video seen by his 41.3million followers.  

In regards to Netflix pumping out 'sequels and prequels' of the record-breaking film, Chris stated that, though nothing has been confirmed, he would gladly return to the role. 

'There has been a lot of talk about sequels and prequels and all sorts of things and all I can say is who knows, but with this kind of support it is something I will be pretty stoked to jump back into.'
