Paris is set to impose strict new regulations in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases.

Emmanuel Macron's government has ordered bars in Paris, along with Lyon and nine other cities on 'heightened alert', to close at 10pm.

There is also a 10-person restriction at public gatherings with attendees at weddings and parties limited to 30.

The move comes as the president tries to avoid imposing a full lockdown across the country with the French economy already set to shrink by 8.7 per cent this year.

The French government recently announced that it would be pumping €100billion (£91billion) into the economy as part of a recovery plan. 

Politician Macron hopes that this will help the French economy to get moving again by 2022. 

Paris Fashion Week, which is set to host presentations by Kenzo, Kenneth Ize and Schiaparelli, will end on October 6.
