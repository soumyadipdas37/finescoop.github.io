It comes days after Chezzi revealed her pregnancy cravings had started to kick in. 

'Happy Father's Day to the main man in our lives,' she wrote while tagging Grant. '[Grant] who makes everyday feel special!' she continued.

The mother of two revealed that she was constantly sucking on Sour Squirms to keep her energy levels up. 

Chezzi posted about her strange hankering for the sweet treat last Tuesday, and said she was devouring the lollies because she was struggling to eat other foods.

'When a bag of sour lollies can make you this excited!' she told her Instagram followers.
