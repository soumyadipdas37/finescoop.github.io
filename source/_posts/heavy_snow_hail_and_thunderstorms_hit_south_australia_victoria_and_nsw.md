Australia has been plunged back into winter as extreme cold temperatures and wild weather brings snow across the country's south-east.

Thunder storms, hail and heavy snowfall was seen across Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia on Friday due to a cold front sweeping directly up from Antarctica.

The Bureau of Meteorology said the unusually chilly conditions will 'feel more like mid July than late September' with temperatures dropping to 10 degrees less than average.

Snow was seen falling in Ballarat in Victoria's Central Highlands along with Lismore which is just 200m above sea level.

Meanwhile in South Australia, residents near the Flinders Ranges woke to find their backyards blanketed in snow in Hallett, Belalie North, Canowie and Peterborough. 

Heavy snowfall was seen in Tarcowie in South Australia on Friday morning following a night of wild weather

Weatherzone meteorologist Joel Pippard told Daily Mail Australia the front from Antarctica was bringing the ice cold air that usually wouldn't be seen.

'The cold front's going to leave a mark, it's definitely a winter-like weekend,' he said.

'It's going to be quite cold for a couple of days, Melbourne and Sydney won't heat up until around Tuesday.'

Tasmania's Cradle Mountain was hit with around 10-20cm of heavy snowfall while around 7cm fell in Oberon in NSW's Central Tablelands and 3cm in Orange.

Some South Australians were surrounded by such thick snowfall that one man was seen skiing outside his home.

'South Australia typically gets snow once every two to three years and we've already had it snow once there this year so it's pretty unusual,' Mr Pippard said.

'It will continue snowing all day and night over the Alps in Victoria and NSW.'

The weather forecaster said Canberra was also likely to see some snowfall throughout the night and into Saturday morning.

Meanwhile Melbourne was forecasted to reach just 12 degrees - meaning it was the coldest day in Spring since 2002.

Adelaide was also set to reach a top of 13 degrees on Friday - the city's coldest spring day since 1997. 

Melbourne and Sydney will also be battered with thunderstorms late of Friday.
