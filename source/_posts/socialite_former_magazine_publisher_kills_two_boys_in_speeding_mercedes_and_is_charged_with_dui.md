A former magazine publisher and founder of the Grossman Burn Foundation has been arrested after two young brothers were killed in a horrific car crash.

Rebecca Grossman, 57, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and DUI after allegedly smashing her speeding Mercedes into the young boys in Westlake Village, Los Angeles County. 

One of the victims, aged 11, died at the scene while his younger brother, aged nine, died in hospital a few hours later.

Investigators said one boy was carried 100ft on the hood of the car before she braked, at which point he fell off the car and she ran him over again while fleeing the scene.

Rebecca is part of the prominent Grossman family and along with her husband Peter, founded the Grossman Burn Foundation.

She is also the former publisher of Westlake Magazine.

Police said the crash took place at 7.10pm at the intersection of Triunfo Canyon Road and Saddle Mountain Drive.

Six family members were crossing the three-way intersection on a marked crosswalk on the road with no stoplight.

The mother heard the speeding Mercedes and both parents reached out to protect their children and grabbed two of them but the two brothers were too far away and were hit by the car, police said.

One of the boys was carried for more than 100ft down the road on the hood of her car before she hit the brakes, according to KABC. 

The boy then rolled on to the street and she ran him over while leaving the scene before pulling over a mile and a half away, detectives said. 

Grossman was booked on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and DUI and her bail was set at $2million
