If you're tired of ineffective eye creams, Amazon shoppers say the CeraVe Eye Repair Cream is 'is a lifesaver' thanks to its ability to brighten and hydrate the under-eye area.

The eye cream which has over 1,400 reviews on the retailer's site and costs £8.72, (that's 27 per cent off) contains moisture-boosting hyaluronic acid, soothing niacinamide and three essential ceramides to help repair the skins protective barrier.

Bonus: It's free of common irritants such as fragrance, and it's also hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic, making it gentle enough for sensitive skin.

And plenty of customers attest to this, claiming the eye cream from cult US brand CeraVe treats flaky patches and eczema on the under-eye area and eyelids within just a few uses. What more could you want?

'Eczema gone in a matter of days!' exclaimed one shopper in their five-star review. 'I have suffered from eczema under my eye for over a year and have spent a fortune on all sorts of different products. I've used this for two days, and the eczema has gone!

'My eyes are much less puffy, and my dark circles seem to be reducing too! Win-win! Some products have been rubbish to put makeup over, but this one absorbs really well, and it's like putting makeup on bare skin. Excellent product!'

'I have eczema-prone skin around my eyes, and this cream has really helped keep it under control,' wrote another. 'Wouldn't recommend you use if during an active flare-up but more like maintenance once the worst of the symptoms have gone down.'

 Now marked down to £8.27, the eye cream contains moisture-boosting hyaluronic acid, soothing niacinamide and three essential ceramides to help repair the skins protective barrier 

They added: 'I think it has also contributed to lightening the hyperpigmentation I had around the eyes due to eczema. Highly recommend.'

The number one bestseller in Amazon's Eye Creams category is super lightweight, soaks in quickly, and a safe bet for sensitive skin and for those who's eyes are more susceptible to irritation.

Another reviewer added: 'I have really sore eyes. And after a severe reaction to a previous eye cream, my eyes are more sensitive.

'This is really soothing and has helped a lot with the dryness and soreness under my eyes. If I put a bit too much on in tap the rest onto my eyelids. Which is moisturising.'
