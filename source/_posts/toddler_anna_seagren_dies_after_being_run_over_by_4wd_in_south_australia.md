Her devastated parents paid tribute to their youngest daughter, who has an older sister Grace, 5, and brother Jack, 3.

'She was really cheeky, really cuddly and affectionate. She was just a perfect, happy, boisterous, gorgeous girl,' Anna's mother Jessi Seagren told Adelaide Now. 

Shattered at their loss, the Seagrens remembered the happy tot for her cheerfulness and playful nature. 

'She loved going on the motorbikes. 'She loved the chickens. She would chase them around,' Mrs Seagren said.

'(And) she loved her swimming lessons. She was learning to kick her legs.' 

Anna was 'best mates' with her brother Jack and copied everything he did.

They said their baby girl will be 'really missed'.
