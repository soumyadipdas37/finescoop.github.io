The band had teased the big news for days by uploading short clips of a neon lightning bolt to Twitter and Instagram. 

On Thursday, AC/DC finally shared a promotional picture confirming the return of lead guitarist Angus Young, 65, bassist Cliff Williams, 70, and rhythm guitarist Stevie Young, 63.

AC/DC last toured Down Under in 2015 and 2016 for their Rock or Bust World Tour, in support of their sixteenth studio album, Rock or Bust.  

Brian's hearing problems forced him to leave the band mid-tour in 2016.

He was temporarily replaced by Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose, who served as vocalist for the band's remaining concerts.

Doctors had advised the frontman to either quit performing live or face the possibility of 'total hearing loss'.

'That was the darkest day of my professional life,' Brian said of the diagnosis at the time.

AC/DC was formed in Sydney in November 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young.

Following the death of lead singer Bon Scott from acute alcoholic poisoning at the age of 33 in 1980, Brian Johnson was hired to replace him.  

Rhythm guitarist Malcolm was diagnosed with dementia in 2014 and retired to a Sydney nursing home. 

He died on November 18, 2017 at the age of 64.
