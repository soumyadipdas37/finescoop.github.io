Amy Hart unveiled the results of her seven-day juice diet in a series of Instagram snaps shared on Tuesday.

The Love Island star, 27, displayed the difference in her figure in before and after pictures as she revealed she's lost 2 kg (4.4 lbs) following her Portuguese retreat with Juice Master Jason Vale.

Admitting she didn't go on the trip in a bid to shed weight, the former flight attendant insisted she embarked on the lifestyle overhaul alone to 'overcome her social anxiety' as she went on a solo holiday for the first time.

The media personality, who already boasted a toned figure, showcased her slimmed-down frame in a barely-there black bikini.

'However, that isn’t why I went. As well as 2kg I Went on holiday on my own for the first time.

'All in all a successful week!' The media personality, who already boasted a toned figure, showcased her slimmed-down frame in a barely-there black bikini

'Hauled myself out of bed everyday for a hike between 5-11km sometimes in a 5kg vest... jumped in a river... has a reset ready to come home and start a new chapter!

'All in all a successful week!! Thanks so much to @jasonvale for an amazing concept. Can’t wait to come back!!' (sic) 

Her trip comes after Amy proved there were no hard feelings with ex Curtis Pritchard as they happily posed for a snap together late last month. 

The blonde beauty cosied up to Curtis, 24, in a sweet snap captioned: 'Nostalgia babes x', five months after his split from fellow Islander Maura Higgins, 29.

The dancer also posted a snap of the pair, captioned: 'Good to see you x @amyhartxo.'

In the wake of the reunion, the former British Airways employee re-followed her former flame on Instagram.

Later on the evening, Amy looked a little worse for wear as she put on an animated display and hung onto her friend while leaving the Proud Embankment venue after the boozy Cabaret All Stars Show in London.

Curtis, a professional ballroom dancer with a talent for tango, left Amy devastated after he started to chase after single Islander Jourdan Riane while Amy was away in Casa Amor.

Former air-stewardess Amy then told producers she wanted to leave the August series, after her 'half-boyfriend' split with her and began to chase after Islander Maura, who he went on to date, but split from in March.
