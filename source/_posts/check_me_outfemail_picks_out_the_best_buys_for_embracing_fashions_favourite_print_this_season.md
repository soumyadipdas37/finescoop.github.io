It’s time to ditch those summer florals and embrace autumn’s sharpest pattern, geometric.

The Autumn/Winter 2020 catwalks overflowed with hexagon-print dresses by Christopher Kane and Sixties-style trousers by Issey Miyake. It is no wonder the High Street has taken note and is consequently overflowing with bold, graphic designs.

Heading to the office? Team a jazzy blouse with a simple skirt. Feeling brave and keen to stand out? Pair sculptural heels with a flattering shirt-dress. This season, being square has never been so chic.

British style expert Emily Monckton, shared her advice for embracing this season's geometric trend. Pictured: Michaela Coel wearing a dress made by her mother
