A frantic search is underway for two teenage girls who left school in their uniforms, dyed their hair black and caught a bus out of town before disappearing.

Madeline Dixon and Molly Martin were last seen leaving Collegiate Middle School in Hobart in school uniform at 8.45am on Wednesday morning. 

Police are appealing for public assistance to find the two 14-year-old girls.

Tasmanian detectives released an update about 8.30pm with new information that indicated the girls had 'attempted to alter their appearance' after leaving school grounds.

They both reportedly dyed their hair black and changed out of their school clothes into darker outfits.

Police claim both teens were last spotted together about 2.10pm on a bus from Rosny to Carlton.

They indicated they would get off the bus at Sorell, and police have reason to believe both Madeline and Molly remain in the area.

One of Maddie's relatives admitted he had 'no clue' who she would know in the region.

'I wouldn't have a clue who she associates with as her side of the family doesn't really talk to mine as much as we'd all like to,' he said.

'I just hope she's okay and nothing needs to be taken any further.'

Maddie was last seen wearing a black Nike jacket, grey crop top and track pants. She was carrying a large shoulder bag. 

Police fear the girls may be trying to cross state borders early on Thursday morning.   

“We are extremely thankful with the information that we have currently received which has proven to be exceptionally helpful,' a Tasmania Police spokesman said on Wednesday night.

'I strongly encourage members of the public to notify Tasmania Police with any further information that they may have,” Sergeant Simon Ward said.

Anyone with information should contact police on 131 444.
