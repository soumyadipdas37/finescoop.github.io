Brighton are weighing up whether to loan out one of their next highly-rated academy prospects Max Sanders after he starred on his full debut.

England under-19 midfielder Sanders stole the show on his first start for the Seagulls in their 2-0 Carabao Cup win at Preston on Wednesday night to help set up a fourth round clash with Manchester United.

Sanders, 21, got his first taste of senior football last season when he made 22 appearances while on loan at AFC Wimbledon in League One.

He is keen to gain more experience by playing regularly and Brighton, who have high hopes for Sanders, are considering the next best move for his development.

A number of Championship clubs have enquired about taking him on loan.

There is a strong academy presence in Graham Potter’s Premier League side with Lewis Dunk, Ben White, Solly March and Aaron Connolly all emerging from their youth ranks.

More have featured in the Carabao Cup including Sanders, a technical all-round central midfielder who is good on the ball, possesses a wide passing range and is comfortable in either a disciplined holding or box-to-box role.

Potter is not short of central midfielders, even after letting Aaron Mooy and Dale Stephens leave permanently during this window.

That may make another loan move for Sanders the ideal solution though one stumbling block is that he is now into the last year of his contract and would be a free agent once any temporary switch is over. Brighton have an option to extend Sanders’ deal by a further year.

Sanders, who joined Brighton aged eight and made his debut as a sub in the previous round against Portsmouth, shone against Preston, completing 91 per cent of his passes.

Potter said: ‘It’s not an easy position [central midfield]. He played with responsibility, getting on the ball, having courage to get it under pressure and did his defensive work well.’
