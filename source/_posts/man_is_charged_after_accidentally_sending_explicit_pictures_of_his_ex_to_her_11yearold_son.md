A man who accidentally sent 20 sexually explicit photos and two videos of his ex-wife to her young son has been placed on a good behaviour bond.

The Brisbane man was found guilty on Tuesday of using a carriage service to harass after he sent the material to a mobile phone in March 2018, The Courier Mail reported.

While the phone was originally bought for the 11-year-old boy, it was also used to facilitate contact between the former lovers after she blocked him on her phone.

The court heard how the boy took the device to his mother when he received the messaged and did not open them.

Magistrate Belinda Merrin told the court that the woman felt 'degraded, sick and angry' when she saw the messages. 

All images and videos were taken consensually while they were married, the court heard.

The man pleaded not guilty to the harassment charges, claiming he was trying to 'rekindle' their relationship.

But Ms Merrin rejected his claim and said his ex-wife made it clear she only wanted to communicate via email.

'They were sent in circumstances that the complainant was very clear that the only method of communication she wanted to have with the defendant was by email and solely for the purposes, as it related to the children.'

'It must be very obvious to you that would have been completely unwanted, unwelcome and likely to cause upset.' 

When asked whose phone it was by police, the man responded: 'That's not his phone that's [the woman's] phone.'

The magistrate could not prove the man was aware the phone belonged to the woman's son when he sent the messaged.

He was released on a $600 recognisance order and a nine-month good behaviour bond.
