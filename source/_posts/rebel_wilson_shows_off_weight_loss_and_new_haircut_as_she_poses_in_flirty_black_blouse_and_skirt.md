Rebel Wilson is currently back in Los Angeles and she made sure to stop in to her favourite hair stylist to get her quarrantine hair tended to. 

The actress dropped by to visit her best friend, celebrity hair cutter and colourist Nicole Leal, to update her blonde locks. 

Showing off the results of the neat new cut in a mirror selfie shared to Instagram Stories, the 40-year-old also flaunted her incredible weight loss.

Rebel looked sensational in a frilly black blouse and fitted skirt that fit perfectly to her trim physique. 

The top featured scalloped sleeves and a peplum design, sitting beautifully over the pencil skirt, with Rebel adding a thin belt to ensemble. 

She poked her tongue out in the mirror, her prominent cheekbones and slimmed down features evident.

Rebel  has been on a health and fitness journey so far this year, losing at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone).   

Last month, Rebel updated fans on her weight loss journey by sharing several photos to Instagram of herself looking slimmer in a tight blue dress.

The Bridesmaids star explained in the caption that she was inching closer and closer to her goal weight of 75kg (165lbs, or 11.8 stone).

'Thanks for all the love so far on my "Year of Health" journey,' she told her followers.

'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself 'hmmmm...better not' and had a bottle of water instead.'

'Eight kilos to go until I hit my goal. Hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'
