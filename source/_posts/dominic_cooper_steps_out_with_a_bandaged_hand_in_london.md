Dominic Cooper stepped out with a bandaged hand in London on Wednesday. 

The Mamma Mia! star, 42, cut a low-key figure in a vibrant gym wear as he enjoyed a stroll in the British capital.

Dominic opted for a pair of neon pink shorts with a cobalt blue T-shirt with a matching vest top over it.

Adding some finishing touches, the star opted for a grey hoodie, trainers, black crossover bag and an identical blue beanie hat.

The actor appeared to be picking up a hot beverage and food during his stroll on Wednesday.

It is not known how Dominic has injured his hand or why it was bandaged. MailOnline has contacted representatives for comment.

The appearance comes after the Hollywood star enjoyed a rural Scottish getaway with girlfriend Gemma Chan and close friends Richard Madden and Lily James.

Richard and Gemma starred together in Eternals while Lily and Dominic co-starred in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.   

The foursome posted several snaps of their rural getaway together to social media.

Dominic, Gemma and Richard decided to avoid the hustle and bustle of their respective homes in the city to stay in Blair Athol, a village in Perthshire known for its rustic stone buildings and scenic landscape.

Preacher star Dominic and Crazy Rich Asians actor Gemma live together in London, but decided to escape the city to meet up with Scots-born Madden, who had spent isolation in Los Angeles with actor Froy Gutierrez.

Richard and Gemma have been long time friends and joined one another last year on the red carpet at the SAG awards.

During her trip to Scotland, Gemma explored the local farm life posing with lambs, while the boys made the most of their Land Rovers and even jumped on the bonnet of one for a socially distanced picture.

Richard said of the trip: 'Best time with my favourite people. Thank you Land Rover for the hot wheels.'

Referring to the song The Bonnie Banks of a Loch Lomond, Dominic added: 'You take the high road and I’ll take the low road and I’ll be in Scotland before you.'

Since returning to London last month, Dominic was seen taking Gemma for a spin in his £54,000 Jaguar.

The actor purchased the luxury sports car after he was left devastated when his classic Austin Healey, which retails around £65,000, was stolen by thieves.  

He and Gemma confirmed their relationship in September 2018 and she was previously in a long-term relationship with Jack Whitehall. 

Dominic's most high-profile romance was with his Mamma Mia! co-star Amanda Seyfried, 34.
