A grandfather who led police on a 90 minute high-speed chase after fleeing from a coronavirus check point has been banned from driving for life. 

Stephen Hall, 83, sped through an army road stop at Morangup, north-west of Perth on May 10 in his silver Jeep.

He pleaded guilty to failing to stop, failing to comply with a direction of the emergency management act and dangerous driving at Perth Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday.

Hall, of Armadale, was fined $8500 in total for the three charges and prohibited from ever operating a vehicle again.   

The court heard officers pursued him for 27km through the town of Toodyay before they finally punctured his tyres using a stinger.  

The grandfather, who said he was on his way to see a friend in the town, stopped at the checkpoint to speak with an Australian Defence Force officer.

The elderly driver was told he was not allowed to pass through, but accelerated through the checkpoint regardless.

Police prosecutors said during the chase Hall had driven at speeds up to 136km/ph and veered into the other lane.  

Lawyer Katherine Dowling argued against a jail sentence, telling the court Hall was in the first stages of Alzheimer's and dementia and has been living in squalor for years.

She said he is now living in a care facility.

Days after his arrest, Hall told reporters he believed he had done nothing wrong and police owe him a new set of tyres.

'There were four coppers after me. I gave them a right run for their money. They’ve never had a run like that,' he previously told 9News. 

'First of all they are paying for a new set of tyres, all four of them, Coopers sports.'

'I’ve done nothing wrong, but I put my foot down.'
