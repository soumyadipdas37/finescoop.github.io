A woman taking a morning stroll was subject to a brutal attack by a 'large man' in which she was dragged into a bush and raped, police in Queensland said. 

The 66-year-old was walking along a pathway next to the Ross River near Victor Street in Townsville's Cranbrook on Wednesday just before 6am.

She was grabbed from behind by a large unknown man and sexually assaulted before he fled the scene.

The traumatised woman is now being treated in Townsville University Hospital after suffered serious facial injuries in the attack.

An elderly woman was brutally dragged into bush land and raped on her morning walk next to the Ross River near Victor Street in Townsville's Cranbrook (pictured) on Wednesday 

Police were called to the scene and found the woman sitting on the grass 'shaken' and 'upset'.

'This is a horrendous thing to happen to anyone … she's been provided the best possible care,' District Duty Officer Senior Sergeant Scot Warrick told the Courier Mail.

A large crime scene has been set up and detectives are now scouring the area to find any information that may identify the perpetrator.  

Police said the woman was not able to give a clear description of the man and they are urging anyone who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward immediately. 

'This is a pretty popular area at this time of the morning for walkers and exercising, there would have been many people here this morning, along with residents along this area,' Sen Sgt Warrick said.

'I am confident that someone may have seen something or someone suspicious … we need every piece of information.'

Police rushed to the scene and found the woman sitting on the grass 'shaken' and 'upset'

The disturbing incident has rocked the quiet, close-knit community on the riverbank of Townsville.

One resident who was walking his dog at about 7am this morning said he had moved to the area in 1984, and had never heard of anything like it happening before.

Another neighbour described the situation as 'horrible' and said the attack made them feel uneasy.
