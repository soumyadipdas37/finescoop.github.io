Australia's top fashion bloggers are creating effortlessly stylish looks with a corduroy shirt from Kmart that's currently reduced to just $9.

Available in beige and a rich burgundy, the long-sleeved button-up top is winning praise on Instagram for its comfort, versatility and remarkable affordability.

There are only limited sizes of shade 'Peanut' left in stock online, but 'Shiraz' – named after the popular red wine – is still in available in six, eight, 12 and 14.

On Instagram, Melbourne stylist Maria, who posts as The Budget Savvy Girl, said she loves the 'edginess' the ribbed texture adds to an outfit.

Perth fashion blogger Louisa Sabrina agreed and said she is looking forward to summer when she plans to wear it over a crop top and linen shorts.

One follower replied: 'It's such a gorgeous shirt babe. I saw this before the lockdown, now I wish I picked it up. You look fab in it!'

Others said she had inspired them to buy the shirt, which has also been endorsed by up-and-coming influencer 'This is Genevieve'.

The Canberra fashionista - who is known for creating chic outfits from cheap clothing - paired the shirt with a pair of $20 Kmart jeans which have been flying off shelves in recent weeks.

Women have compared the bargain denim to an iconic style of Levi's jeans that retail for $191 – more than nine times the price.

The 'Super High-Rise Straight' trousers sit right on the waistline and hang neatly over the legs without accentuating 'problem' areas like the upper thighs.

Australian influencers have been raving about the quality and affordability on Instagram, with Sydney blogger 'Luxe and Lemonade' sparking a rush on the jeans with a recent outfit post.

'Did I need these $20 straight leg, super high-rise jeans from Kmart? No. Did I want them? 1,000 times yes,' she wrote in the caption.

One follower replied: 'After this post, I rushed down to Kmart to purchase - you definitely convinced me!'

Plus-size style blogger Sarah-Elyss said the jeans are 'very similar' to her favourite pair from Next, which are likely to be the remarkably similar Levi's high-rise straight jeans that retail for $191.

Brisbane blogger Jasmine Hunt said she was 'pretty much obsessed' with the fit, while Canberra influencer 'This is Genevieve' has been showcasing the versatility by styling the jeans with cropped jumpers, heeled boots, blazers and belts on her feed.

One woman said: 'My favourite jeans right now! I feel sorry for my other jeans!'
