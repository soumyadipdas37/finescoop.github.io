Chloe arrived in a tight-fitting white crop top which covered up her surgically-enhanced cleavage but showed off her toned midriff.

She teamed the look with black leggings, trainers and wore special gloves to protect herself from getting blisters while lifting the heavy weights.

As personal trainer Michael Evans, who also trains ex TOWIE star Kate Ferdinand, set Chloe to work, the reality star grimaced as she did a series of exercises working on her upper-body strength.

The hit ITVBe show posted a video to Twitter of key moments from the show's history including when Lauren Goodger pushed ex Mark Wright into a swimming pool.

Other hilarious parts include Sam Faiers asking for a vajazzle and Gemma Collins telling people to 'Google her'.

TOWIE tweeted: 'SHUT UP! 10 years of #TOWIE!? BRAND NEW episodes coming this September, starting with an anniversary special.

'Things are about to get REEM, You ain't ready for this candy! #TOWIE10 on @ITVBe.'

The video starts off by zooming in on a satellite view of the world as it pans in on a 'welcome to Essex' sign.

It then sees Sam, 29, asking Amy Childs, 30, for a vajazzle with Harry Derbidge, she says: 'Have you heard of the vajazzle, can you do me one?' 

Although several familiar faces have been lined up to appear on the special, including Chloe's cousin Joey Essex and Danielle Armstrong, main man Mark Wright is said to have 'moved on' and is not planning a comeback reports The Sun.
