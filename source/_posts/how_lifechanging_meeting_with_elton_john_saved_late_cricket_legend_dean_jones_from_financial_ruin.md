Late Australian cricket legend Dean Jones was about to risk it all in 1999, by putting up $10million to bring David Beckham and Manchester United to Australia.

Jones had a thriving event management company known for bringing huge acts Down Under - but the business of live events and sport is always a huge risk.

On the eve of the biggest deal of his life, his long-time friend Elton John saved the batsman from financial ruin, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Jones was part of a three-man consortium that had just pulled off a major coup bringing the FIFA World XI to Australia to play the Socceroos.

They'd also got mega-band INXS back together after the death of singer Michael Hutchence to launch the Sydney Olympic Stadium ahead of the 2000 Games.

Although it was major windfall netting $15million, the process was far from smooth sailing.

Jones had to get a $5million loan against his family house and there were talks the band could pull out up until the morning of the show.

Any last-minute crisis could have ruined Jones and the stress of the huge business gamble was something he vowed to never go through again.

But with the David Beckham's Manchester United fresh off European football's Triple Crown, an opportunity presented itself.

The powers that be at the club wanted Jones to put up $10million for a tour of Australia.

He was about to sign but decided to give it a final thought. 

That night he visited superstar singer-songwriter Elton John in his hotel room at the Crown Casino in Melbourne.

'I told Elton what date they were playing (in July),' Jones recently said on a podcast hosted by Australian cricketer Shane Watson in June. 

Jones said it was then he realised that the date clashed with the Beckhams' wedding, where Elton had been invited to play.  

'And I've gone, "ohhhh, so half the team is going to be with Beckham!"'

Jones knew with the likes of Beckham, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more likely to be a no-show, the financial risk was huge.   

'I went back to them (United management) and said, "is that date right?" I said, "you've got nothing on?",' Jones said.

'They didn't care. Not worried about advertising these guys' names and they don't turn up.

'Rene Rivkin was also trying to bid for it and I gave it to him for $200k and he ended up taking the heat.' 

He quickly bailed on the plan and credited his mate Elton with saving him from potential bankruptcy.

Following the shock news of Jones' death last week aged 59 in India, Elton took to social media to voice his heartfelt sorrow.

The player turned commentator, who was born in Coburg, Melbourne, suffered a 'massive' heart attack in a Mumbai hotel on Thursday.   

Jones was in the subcontinent as part of Star India's commentating team for the IPL, which is being played in the UAE. 

He collapsed in the lobby of the hotel as he entered with former fast bowler Brett Lee, who desperately tried to revive him with CPR.

According to close friends, Jones went for a run on Thursday morning before suffering the heart attack at lunchtime.  

Jones is hailed for revolutionising the One Day International format.

The cricket great played in 52 Tests for Australia and averaged 46.55 batting in the middle order.

'Anyone who watched cricket in the 1980s and 1990s will fondly recall his cavalier approach at the crease and the incredible energy and passion he brought to every game he played.'
