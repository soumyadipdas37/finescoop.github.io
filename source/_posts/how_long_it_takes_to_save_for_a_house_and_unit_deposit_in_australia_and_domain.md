Saving up for a mortgage deposit to buy even a basic apartment a long way from the city can take more than five years in Australia.

The first recession in almost three decades as a result of coronavirus shutdowns has reduced the prices of houses and units.

Despite that, saving up for a 20 per cent deposit would still take a young couple five years and seven months in Sydney for a basic $585,000 apartment, the Domain First-Home Buyer Report has revealed.

Help is at hand, however, with the federal government's $500million First Home Loan Deposit Scheme enabling property newcomers to buy a home with a five per cent deposit.

Taxpayers underwrite the rest of the 20 per cent deposit.

Domain senior research analyst Nicola Powell said the government program had made it much easier for first-home buyers.

'Although the majority of capital cities saw the journey to home ownership become a little longer compared to the same time last year, in recent months weakening prices will eventually translate to improved affordability,' she said.

'Buying conditions have improved, first-home buyers appear to be taking advantage of retreating investor activity, reduced foreign buyer interest, the extension of the federal government’s first home loan deposit scheme and other state-based incentives.'

Under this scheme, saving up for a deposit in Sydney for a simple apartment is reduced to just one year and four months for a couple aged 25 to 34. 

Those seeking an apartment closer to the city have more choice at Parramatta, Auburn, Merrylands and Canterbury.

Sydney, one of the world's most expensive property markets, is a particularly daunting place to buy a house, with median prices still a shade under $1million.

Melbourne's city centre and the Tullamarine and Broadmeadows areas in the north offer the most affordable units.

Buying a basic $425,000 house with a 20 per cent deposit takes four years and six months of saving but under the commonwealth scheme, that is reduced to just 13 months. 

In the first half of 2020, 8,912 home buyers across Australia were able to buy a property with a five per cent deposit under the government program.

The scheme is available for singles earning up to $125,000 and couples on combined salaries of up to $200,000.
