They recently returned to Los Angeles from a trip to the tourist haven Coeur d'Alene in Idaho.

And Hailey and Justin Bieber marked their return home with dinner on Wednesday night at one of their favorite spots, the swanky Japanese restaurant Nobu in Malibu.

The 23-year-old model unveiled a chic tan outfit that highlighted her long toned legs for the occasion, while her 26-year-old pop star husband opted for a more casual tie-dye sweatshirt.

Hailey's look featured a baggy tan shirt that was left partially open at the top to expose one of her tanned shoulders.

She put on a cheeky display in tiny tan shorts, and she elevated her 5ft7in height with a pair of pointy nude heels. 

The daughter of Stephen Baldwin accessorized with a scrunched-up tan handbag on a long string, and she wore her dirty blonde locks in two braided pigtails.

Justin stuck with a more casual look featuring a pink and blue tie-dye sweatshirt and baby blue jeans that matched his blue athletic shoes.

The day before, Hailey shared some humorous throwback photos of herself and Justin on her Insta Stories to match up with their present-day looks.

A photo that the Sorry singer originally posted to his Instagram showed the two enjoying sushi aboard a private jet while Hailey stuck her tongue out dramatically, and she posted a side-by-side with a picture of herself sticking her tongue out from when she was a little kid.

Justin joined in on the fun with a short video that was also shared in Hailey's Insta Stories.

She started by zooming in on his phone, on which he had a funny picture of himself with a strained smile and bulging eyes as he stood next to a friend.

Hailey pulled back the camera and panned over to Justin's face to reveal his updated attempt at the crooked smile.

'OMG,' she captioned the hilarious expression.

The couple recently returned from their picturesque road to Idaho, where they shared some lovely snaps from Lake Coeur d'Alene.

Hailey shared a cute photo of the married couple embracing on a boat, as well as a shot that showed off her trim physique and her black bikini.

The daughter of Stephen even has a tattoo reading 'coeur d'Alene' under her left shoulder blade, though it's for her sister Alaia's middle name, rather than the popular tourist attraction.
