Denise Richards left Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills this summer after only two seasons with the hit reality TV show.

And on Monday Bravo star Andy Cohen of Watch What Happens Live fame shared that the 49-year-old star's departure was a matter of a stalled negotiation.

'I'm just sad we couldn't reach an agreement for next season,' the single father told PeopleTV's Reality Check which aired on Monday. 'I'm kind of living in that sadness.'   

No deal: Denise Richards has left Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills and on Monday Bravo star Andy Cohen of Watch What Happens Live fame shared that the 49-year-old star's departure was a matter of a stalled negotiation

Sad Andy: 'I'm just sad we couldn't reach an agreement for next season,' the single father told PeopleTV's Reality Check which aired on Monday. 'I'm kind of living in that sadness'

According to Cohen, the former Playboy magazine cover girl was 'in talks' to return for another season when she decided not to return.

'We were negotiating a deal with her and we couldn't reach an agreement on the deal,' he explained. 

That leaves the show with Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley and Teddy Mellencamp, among others.

Of that list, Kyle is the only original cast member. The show launched in 2010.

Kiss and tell: All seemed to be fine for a while but when part-time RHOBH member Brandi Glanville accused her of having a sexual relationship, Denise denied it then lashed out

Denise was a bit of a surprise as a new cast member when she joined in 2019 because she was the only one who had a real Hollywood career.

She had been in the blockbusters like 1997's Starship Troopers and 1999's The World Is Not Enough.

Denise had also experienced a high-profile marriage to Charlie Sheen from 2002 to 2006. 

All seemed to be fine for a while but when part-time RHOBH member Brandi Glanville accused her of having a sexual relationship, Denise denied it then lashed out.

Still standing: Now that Denise has exited the show, that leaves Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne, Lisa Rinna and Teddy Mellencamp, among others

She did it: 'She's answering her truth,' said Cohen. 'She has a family and kids. Whatever happened or didn't happen, I would imagine that it's something that maybe she didn't really care to discuss on a television show'

The other cast members did not support her but rather turned on the Wild Things actress.  

'She's answering her truth,' said Cohen. 'She has a family and kids. Whatever happened or didn't happen, I would imagine that it's something that maybe she didn't really care to discuss on a television show.' 

A source told People that Denise wants to spend time with her family.

She has been wed to Aaron Phypers for two years.

Richards has three daughters - Lola, 15, and Sam, 16, with ex-husband Charlie Sheen and adopted Eloise, aged nine.

'Denise is excited to be home from Spain with her husband and children. Filming [Glow And Darkness] in Spain has been wonderful as the only pot being stirred is their incredible Spanish food,' the source said.
