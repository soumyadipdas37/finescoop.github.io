Fans have been singing the praises of Tottenham midfielder Tanguy Ndombele after his involvement in their equaliser against Southampton.

The French midfielder picked up the ball in the middle of the pitch after showing his strength against Saints hard man Oriel Romeu. 

He then creates space for himself with a perfect piece of skill to get past James Ward-Prowse and get Spurs on the attack.

Ndombele produced a moment of magic in the build up to Tottenham's equaliser 

Ndombele then put the ball through to Harry Kane who set up Son Hueng-min in a fast, flowing move all begun by the Frenchman.

One fan tweeted: 'That was a world class piece of skill from Ndombele. World class'

Another fan said that the Tottenham midfielder is about to surpass Manchester United's Paul Pogba in the French set-up following his first half display. 

They tweeted: 'Ndombele really about to end pogbas international career.'





Despite impressing in the first half of Tottenham's match against Southampton in the Premier League, Ndombele was dragged off at half-time, minutes after his moment of magic.

He was replaced by Giovani Lo Celso, who has shared the same injury woes as his counterpart in recent months.

There have been question marks over Jose Mourinho's faith in Ndombele after he made it quite clear last season that he was not in his favoured starting side.
