QPR are taking a keen interest in one of non-league's hottest prospects, Sorba Thomas of Boreham Wood.

The 21-year-old former West Ham academy product has been earning rave reviews from league scouts with his performances on the right wing and as a wing-back.

QPR director of football Les Ferdinand, who himself was plucked from non-league football, has a track record of developing lower league talent and is looking to strengthen his squad amid interest from Crystal Palace and Celtic in Bright Osayi Samuel.

However, QPR face competition from Charlton Athletic and Barnsley who are selling winger Jacob Brown to Stoke City.

The athletic Thomas started out as a striker before converting to the wing where National League Boreham have utilised his strength, pace and skill to good effect.

He has established himself quickly as a crowd favourite and in turn has caught the eye of league scouts keen to unearth a bargain who recognise hims as one of the brightest talents in the division.

Thomas has one year left on contract but amid increasing interest, Boreham are anticipating offers before the window shuts next month.
