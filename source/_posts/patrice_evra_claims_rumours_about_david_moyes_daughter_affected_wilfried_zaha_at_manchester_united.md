Patrice Evra has hinted that unfounded rumours about Wilfried Zaha's affair with David Moyes' daughter ruined the winger's career at Manchester United in 2013.

The Crystal Palace winger was a promising player in the Old Trafford ranks when Sir Alex Ferguson retired and Moyes replaced the legendary Scot seven years ago. 

But Zaha played just four times under Moyes in his debut season at Old Trafford before moving back to Palace, with Evra claiming that the suspected affair with the ex-United coach's daughter while he was playing there having an effect on him.

Speaking on Sky Sports on Saturday night, the Frenchman said: 'I remember what ruined his career for Manchester United is when he had this true or untrue affair with David Moyes' daughter. 

'Because in the pre-season I remember he was playing every game but when that news came out, (he was) out of the game and he disappeared. He would be a massive trade for United.' 

Zaha responded to the rumours about the suspected affair back in 2015, telling Sportsmail that he has not even met Moyes' daughter.

The winger said: 'The thing that really frustrated me about the whole United thing was the fact that people didn't know what actually went on at the training ground. 

'There were just a load of rumours that used to just come out somehow and people would believe them. 

'It was either I slept with David Moyes's daughter or I have got a bad attitude. Those are the two rumours that stuck with me until I left. I have had no say since then.'

Since leaving Old Trafford back in 2014, shortly after Moyes' sacking, Zaha has become a cult hero at Selhurst Park, taking his total Eagles appearances to 364 matches over two separate spells.

After scoring 23 times for Palace over the last three seasons, he netted the winner in the Eagles' opening match of the 2020-21 season against Southampton last weekend.

Just before Zaha took on United in Saturday's Premier League clash at Old Trafford, Evra gave an insight into the dangers that the 27-year-old possesses and how the winger has even outgrown Palace.

Evra added: 'He's really clever. You have to give him the keys because all Crystal Palace fans know that Wilfried Zaha is better than Crystal Palace, with all due respect. But he's such an electric player.'
