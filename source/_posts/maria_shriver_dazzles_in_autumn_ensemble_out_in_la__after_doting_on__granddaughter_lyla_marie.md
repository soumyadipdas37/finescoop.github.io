Maria Shriver was snapped in a brown maxi dress as she stepped on for a meeting in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

The 64-year-old journalist and author had her brown locks parted and to the side as she toted a white purse and wore animal print sneakers on the daytime outing.

Maria was spotted Sunday on a walk in Santa Monica with her daughter Katherine Schwarzenegger, 30, and one-month-old granddaughter Lyla Marie.

The latest: Maria Shriver, 64, was snapped in a brown maxi dress as she stepped on for a meeting in Los Angeles on Tuesday  

Katherine, 30, and her husband, Guardians of the Galaxy leading man Chris Pratt, 41, revealed on August 10 they had welcomed the child in a social media post.

On the post, Maria left a message that read, 'So happy for you Lyla Maria is so blessed to have you both as parents you are going to be a amazing mama you already are !!!'

Speaking with Entertainment Tonight earlier this year, the Chicago-born Shriver joked she 'not embracing that name [of grandma] exactly.'

She said, 'I’m gonna come up with my own name. I’ll just be Mama. No, I can’t do that. I’ve got to do something else. I’ll think of it. I’ll figure it out.'

The daughter of the late Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver said she was 'really proud of' Katherine as she and Pratt start a family.

'Obviously, she and Chris are super happy,' said Maria, who is also mother to Christina, 29, Patrick, 27, and Christoper, 22, with former husband Arnold Schwarzenegger. 'They’re a blessing to each other.'

In May, Katherine paid homage to her mother in a social media post, calling Shriver 'the greatest and most remarkable Mama in the entire world.'

She continued: 'We are the luckiest 4 kids in the entire world to have you as our mama.

'I am so beyond blessed to learn from you and you have made me want to be a mama for as long as I can remember. You mother not only us 4, but everyone you come in contact with. You are the Queen mother to all and I am so lucky to have you as my mom. I love you!'
