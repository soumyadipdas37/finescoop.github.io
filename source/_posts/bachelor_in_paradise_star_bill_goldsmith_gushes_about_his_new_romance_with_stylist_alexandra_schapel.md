Bill and Alexandra have been spending time together in Queensland, and recently went on a camping trip together.

Alexandra shared several happy snaps from the trip a few days ago. 

The happy couple were seen soaking up the sunshine while showing off their toned beach bodies in swimwear.   

Bill confirmed the pair had found love with each other to Daily Mail Australia last month.

Bill hit the headlines for a relationship other than his own earlier earlier this year, after making sexist comments about Alisha Aitken-Radburn. 

Alisha, 26, declared her love for Glenn Smith, 32, during Sunday night's finale of Paradise, which was filmed in December - but it's believed they subsequently split and 'hooked up' with other people, before deciding to get back together.

Taking to Instagram on Sunday, Bill shared a Daily Mail Australia article about the pair's brief break, and wrote: '"Hooked up" @DailyMailAU you are being too kind.'

'Wait until you hear the full details hahaha,' he added, alongside the squirting water and eggplant emojis and the hashtag #SheWasThirsty.

Interestingly, Bill made no mention of the fact that Glenn had also hooked-up with Helena Sauzier during his break from dating Alisha.  

During Friday's episode of the So Dramatic podcast, the host revealed that Glenn and Alisha had called it quits shortly after leaving Fiji and during this time they both 'hooked up' with different people.

Bill has only recently emerged back into the spotlight, following his own run on season two of Bachelor In Paradise. 

The mechanical plumber had a short-lived romance with Alex Nation before the pair split after leaving Fiji. 

He was later seen kissing a mystery brunette in his work van in Melbourne.
