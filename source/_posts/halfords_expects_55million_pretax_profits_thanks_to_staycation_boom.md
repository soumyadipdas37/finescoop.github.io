Halfords has said it expects to surpass profit targets after strong summer sales momentum driven by demand for cycling and staycations continued into September.

It said it now expects to post pre-tax profits above £55 million for the first half of the current financial year.

Earlier this month, the motoring and bikes firm revealed that sales jumped over the 20 weeks to August 21 as it was particularly buoyed by its strong cycling business.

Halfords said strong sales momentum in its cycling business continued into September

With cycling being the latest trend, more than 2.5m bikes were sold in the UK last year

Electric scooter owners are offering online guides showing users how to override the devices’ speed-limiting software to reach up to 40mph.

A Mail on Sunday investigation has unearthed dozens of shocking video tutorials encouraging riders to manipulate the battery-powered vehicles and break the law.

In one clip, a British rider promises viewers that their scooter will ‘go like a rocket’. ‘I don’t think you would feel safe going any faster but it’s so much fun,’ he adds.

Rental e-scooters were made legal on some roads in Britain this summer with their speed capped at 15.5mph.

The retailer reported that sales of electric bikes and e-scooters have more than tripled since last year as commuters have turned away from pubic transport for fear of catching coronavirus.

According to Halfords, people tend to avoid public transport and invest in a quirky scooter or bring back to life old bicycles. 

As a result, the retailer's sales of bikes and cycling equipment was 60% higher than last year while the demand for scooters rose to 230%.

It has now said that, despite the peak cycling season coming to an end, the 'positive momentum continued' over the following five weeks.

Group like-for-like sales grew by 22% over the period to September 25, with cycling like-for-like sales rising by 46%.

Halfords chief executive, Graham Stapleton told the Guardian earlier this month: 'Nearly one in three of our adult bikes are electric against just 14% last year, so the proportion we are selling has almost doubled.

'I think that's important because with electric bikes, it is not just leisure, it is for essential use in terms of getting around and getting to work. On some of these bikes you can travel from 40 miles on one charge.'

More than 2.5m bikes were sold in the UK last year, with an average cost of £380, according to market research firm Mintel.

Despite the reported increase in e-scooter sales it is still illegal to ride them in public

Riding rental e-scooters on the roads and cycle paths became legal on July 4. 

However, riding these scooters on pavements will remain illegal and will only be allowed in pre-approved locations. 

It will still be illegal to ride privately-owned electric scooters in public.

You can only ride your own e-scooter on private land, with permission from the person who owns the land. 

You must have a driving licence or a provisional driving licence and be at least 16 years old to hire an electric scooter. 

They will be limited to a maximum speed of 15.5mph and it's recommended that riders wear a helmet.  

Privately-owned e-scooters cannot be legally ridden on the roads because they don't always have visible rear red lights, number plates or signalling ability. 

They are treated the same as motor vehicles because they are classified as Personal Light Electric Vehicles (PLEVs). 

This means they are subject to the same legal requirements as other motor vehicles and must therefore have MOT, tax, licensing and specific construction.  



The new 'green' way of transport has become more popular among Brits especially after the end of the lockdown- countless e-scooters can be seen on UK roads every day, as the rental ones are now legal to ride.

The London-listed company also reported that its motoring retail business saw sales growth improve to 7.5% for the five-week period.

Meanwhile, the group's autocentre business saw revenues grow 'strongly' by 18%.

Halfords said it has launched a national campaign to recruit hundreds of skilled technicians as a result of the 'substantial growth' seen in its stores and autocentres.

Despite strong trading, the retailer told investors it remains cautious in its outlook for the second half of the year.

In a statement, Halfords said: 'The potential impact of second waves of Covid-19 now seems more pronounced than just a few weeks ago, and the economic impact of an end to the furlough scheme and the outcome of Brexit negotiations remains very uncertain.

'We are well placed to address any headwinds we may face and capitalise on the tailwinds as they arise.

'Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong.'

The government supports the trend of cycling as local authorities are invited to bid for cash from a £250m emergency active travel fund.

Simultaneously with the rise of e-bikes sales, the boom in holidays in Britain meant the return of the cars, after four months, when in April, sales were down to 62%-travellers were quick to fit new tyres and spruce up their cars before long road trips.

Halfords says high demand in service and maintenance at its 367 garages proves that more and more people started using their car again.
