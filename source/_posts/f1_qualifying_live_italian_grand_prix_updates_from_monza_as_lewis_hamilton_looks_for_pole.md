We're set for more Formula One action this weekend with Italy the next stop on this very different racing season, as Lewis Hamilton looks to extend his world championship lead.

Hamilton was in dominant form last time out in Belgium, with the six-time world champion leading from start to finish to extend his championship lead in Barcelona ahead of Max Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas.Â 

The two Mercedes drivers will be looking to nail down one-two on Saturday, and indications show that will be the case with the pair each looking in good nick over the two practice sessions on Friday.Â 

Sportsmail's Ollie Lewis will provide live Formula One coverage of the qualifier at Monza including fastest laps, crashes, pit stops and more. Qualifying will begin at 2pm.Â Â 

Host commentator

NoÂ fans at Monza might just suit Mattia Binotto. The Ferrari team principal is under such pressure that he wondered whether to resign.

Usually, spectators crowd the bottleneck at the end of the paddock, pushing their autograph books into the palms of the Ferrari drivers as they climb into their road cars on the way to the teamâ€™s Hotel de la Ville retreat down the road.

According to Formula One, there is a 0% chance of rain during today's qualifying session.

Eight drivers are due to see the race stewards as a result of a number of separate incidents in which drivers looked to catch a slipstream off their rivals to set a quick lap in FP3.Â 

On Friday we saw a really messy situation in Formula 3 with a huge queue of cars looking to get a tow for a hot lap - which can improve times by as much as 0.7 seconds.

It's going to be interesting to see how it pans out from 2pm, with race stewards surely looking to keep on top of a situation that could quickly become farcical, as was the case last year.Â

The Mercedes may have dominated over the two practice sessions on Friday but it was McLaren who enjoyed a strong FP3 this morning, with Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris placing in the top three, behind Valtteri Bottas.

Hamilton was down in 5th, four-tenths behind his Mercedes team-mate.

Hello and welcome to Sportsmailâ€™s live coverage of Formula One qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix.

Last weekend it was a case of another race, another win for Lewis Hamilton. The Brit dominated from start to finish as he comfortably won the Belgian Grand Prix in Spa.

Todayâ€™s qualifying session will see the removal of â€˜party modeâ€™ for the first time, meaning teams must use a single engine mode only for the duration of the session. If Hamiltonâ€™s display in practice on Friday is anything to go by, it should have little effect on the six-time world champion.

Stay tuned for live updates from all three qualifying sessions in Monza, with the action due to get underway at 2pm.
