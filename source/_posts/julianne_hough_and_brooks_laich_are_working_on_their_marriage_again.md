Julianne Hough and Brooks Laich confirmed their personal heartbreak in May: that they had decided to separate after nearly three years of marriage. 

The hope was that they could remain loving friends, which appeared to be exemplified by their continuing to spend time together whenever possible.

But now, some four months on since the split, there's talk the pair are 'definitely working on their marriage again' and that 'a reconciliation is looking more and more likely,' according to People.

Giving it another try? Julianne Hough and husband Brooks Laich are 'working on their marriage again', a source told People; they are pictured in February 2019

The first public sign that Hough and Laich's marriage may be in trouble was when they confirmed they were quarantining separately just after the COVID-19 crisis was deemed a pandemic in March.

Hough, 32, remained at their home in Los Angeles while Laich, 37, bunkered down in rural Idaho.

Another source revealed to People that they decided to take the next step, and part ways, after realizing they were 'perfectly happy and fine being apart' during the pandemic. 

Hopeful: 'A reconciliation is looking more and more likely,' the source also shared some four months after Hough and Laich announced their split; they are pictured in May 2018

'We have lovingly and carefully taken the time we have needed to arrive at our decision to separate,' the estranged couple said in a joint statement on May 29.

'We share an abundance of love and respect for one another and will continue to lead with our hearts from that place. We Kindly request your compassion and respect for our privacy moving forward.'  

At no point during their time apart did the estranged couple ever go public with any negative comments or actions against each other.

'There is honestly no ill will. He loves her. She loves him. I can truly say they always will,' the source said at the time.

Part of her effort to become more emotionally and physically intimate included revealing to Laich that she was 'not straight' when it comes to her sexuality.         

During their time apart, Laich has been described as being open to the possibility of giving the marriage another shot. 

'Julianne likes the idea of freedom but doesn't want to lose such a good, solid guy,' an insider said.

'Everyone who knows him knows how grounded and great he is. Her friends and family don't want her to lose someone like that.'
