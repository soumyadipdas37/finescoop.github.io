Denise Welch was moved to tears during Tuesday's Loose Women as she revealed her youngest son Louis has left home.

The actress, 62, admitted it's 'the end of an era' after Louis decided to move in with a friend, but added she'll still be seeing 'loads of him.'

In recent years Denise's son has followed in her footsteps by pursuing an acting career, and he joined the cast of Emmerdale last year.

Denise told the panel that it was an emotional day to see Louis finally leave home, and broke down in tears as she spoke about saying goodbye to him.

She said: 'He's leaving home today and he's 19, oh my god this is so embarrassing!'

'I know loads of people will be feeling this. It seems like two minutes ago he was clinging onto my leg. He's a fantastic kid and I will see loads of him. 

'When Matty and the boys were forming the band, he was at home till he was about 23. Then their career took off and it was like they were on another planet.'

Last year Louis joined the cast of Emmerdale as teen Danny Harrington, as he follows in his mum's acting footsteps.

The teen has been hard at work with his acting career since 2015, and has landed parts in shows like Vera, Hetty Feather and Doctors.

Denise shares Louis with her husband Tim, who is also a well-established actor and had roles in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and Corrie as Sean Tully's dad Brian. 

Louis is not the first of Denise's sons to join the entertainment industry, as her eldest son Matt is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of The 1975.
