Former Hi-Five star Casey Burgess is set to release her debut album, Space to Breathe, next month. 

The 31-year-old singer has been working on her album in Nashville, Tennessee, for several years.

Opening up about one of the tracks on the album, A Little More Love, the former children's entertainer added that she hopes the 'whole world gets to hear it'. 

'The lyrics say a little more love in the world we could use some and it warms your heart to feel that and want that for the world,' she said. 

'I really hope the whole world gets to hear that one because its really special.'

Last month, Casey, hit back at the people who have told her she needs plastic surgery.

In a candid interview with The Daily Telegraph, the singer recalled a series of shock examples of people casually slipping into conversation that she needed to surgically enhance her appearance.

The 31-year-old revealed: 'A guy came up to me at a bar and told me I was a hard seven, but he thought with a bit of filler, my lips done and some boobs, I would be a strong 10.'

Remember this? Casey joined Hi-Five in 2008, but left the group in 2013, she pursued a solo singing and acting career

'I don't understand how people feel they have a right to enter my space or anyone's space and tell them what they need to do to better themselves. You don't know what that person is going through.

'You don't know if they are happy with who they are. Who are you to speak to a random and tell them they need to inject their face to make their jaw smaller?'

Casey's album Space to Breathe is available from October 2
