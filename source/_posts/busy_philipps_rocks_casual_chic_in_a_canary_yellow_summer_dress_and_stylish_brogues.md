The Cougar Town actress told the magazine that she and Marc have arranged to have time apart as they hunkered down in Los Angeles with their daughters.

'Listen, it's been a process - like everything - but we have been making a point to make sure … that the other one gets time to themselves,' she said.

'So for Marc, a lot of times he really enjoys sitting outside by himself in the middle of the day, which is great.

'When he's out there, I'm like, "I'm not texting him, I'm not asking him where the spatula is that he was the last one to use." It's just, like, go outside, sit down, look at your phone, look at Twitter, do whatever you want to do for an hour.'
