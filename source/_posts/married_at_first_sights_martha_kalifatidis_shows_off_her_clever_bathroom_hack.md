Martha Kalifatidis has won fans with her bathroom hack, which she posted on Instagram Stories recently.

The 31-year-old former Married At First Sight star shared her clever idea for updating the shelf in her shower.

Filming the old shelf, Martha admitted it had seen better days and was in desperate need of an upgrade.

'This is my current shelf in the shower. No matter how many times I Jif it or clean it these marks don't come off and it's all peeling off,' she said.

She then revealed she'd sourced a company on Instagram that made marble trays, asking them to create one to the measurements of her existing shelf.

The former reality star then secured the tray on top of her existing shelf, essentially creating a brand new shower shelf.

'How much cuter is the marble shelf? Oh my God, so much better. Love that! Might get a few more now, just for everything else,' she added. 

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia back in March, Martha admitted that it had been an adjustment moving in with her boyfriend of almost two years, Michael Brunelli, after they relocated to Sydney from Melbourne.  

'We've got a lot to learn about living together, but that's part of being in a relationship, and we're getting there,' she said at the time.

She then listed things the 29-year-old does which annoy her, including his tendency to only rinse dishes and standing in front of the fridge with the door open.

'Another thing he does that annoys me is he runs the shower water when he's not in the shower,' she added. 

'I just feel like it's so wasteful! That is something that breaks my heart. Don't run the water if you're not in there!'
