Joe Biden's wife Jill joined him at the ballot box on Monday wearing a politically-minded pair of $695 boots with the word 'VOTE' written down the sides.

The couple was seen leaving the New Castle Board of Elections in Wilmington, Delaware, after voting early in the state's primary election — and the former second lady made it clear she wants people to follow in her footsteps.  

Jill Biden, 69, donned a pair of Stuart Weitzman's 50/50 Vote boots that have the word 'VOTE' stenciled in funky silver letters to cast her ballot by appointment, one day before the scheduled primaries in the state. 

Democratic imperative: Joe Biden's wife Jill joined him at the ballot box on Monday morning as they voted early in Delaware's primary election 

Message: The 69-year-old former second lady donned a pair of Stuart Weitzman's 50/50 Vote boots that have the word 'VOTE' stenciled in funky silver letters

The black leather boots are part of a collaboration between fashion powerhouse Stuart Weitzman and I Am A voter, a public awareness campaign that promotes voting and civic engagement. 

Only 100 pairs of the limited-edition shoes were made, and 100 per cent of the net profits will be donated to the vote-centric organization.  

The brand's standard 5050 over-the-knee boots have long been a coveted staple for celebrities and shoppers alike, but they don't run cheap. While the 50/50 Vote boots are undoubtedly supporting an important cause, one pair costs just shy of $700. 

Jill Biden paired the boots with a classic black blazer and a purple sheath dress, topping off the look with a black protective face mask.

Joe Biden, 77, also wore a mask with his outfit, which consisted of a navy blazer, a light blue button-down shirt, and blue pants.  

After they voted together, the former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee delivered a speech on climate change exacerbating the wildfires raging in California and other states later in the day from Wilmington, where they live. 

Jill Biden's outfit appeared to be a repeat, as she was seen wearing the same purple frock with a white blazer and silver kitten heels to church the day before.

The Bidens attended a Confirmation mass for their granddaughter Natalie Biden on Sunday at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Catholic Church in Wilmington. 

Jill Biden updated her outfit on Monday by swapping her blazers and shoes, cleverly opting to wear the 50/50 Vote boots to cast her ballot. 

The professor wasn't the first to be seen wearing the limited-edition footwear, however, and she likely won't be the last. 

Nearly three weeks ago, actress Selma Blair shared photos of herself striking a pose in the boots while urging her followers to vote in the upcoming elections.

Popular: Michelle Obama's $430 gold ByChari 'VOTE' necklace went viral after it was spotted around the former first lady's neck while she spoke at the Democratic National Convention 

'Voting in style. But just VOTE. The iconic 50/50 boot from @stuartweitzman in collaboration with @iamavoter,' she captioned the image on Instagram. 'It’s about that time...' 

Last month, former First Lady Michelle Obama causes a stir when she wore a 'VOTE' necklace while speaking at the Democratic National Convention. 

Obama told Americans to 'vote like we did in 2008 and 2012,' subtly underscoring the point by wearing a $430 custom-made ByChari gold necklace that spelled out the word 'VOTE.'

The necklace sold out almost immediately, and became a top-trending search during last hour of the convention, according to Google Trends.
