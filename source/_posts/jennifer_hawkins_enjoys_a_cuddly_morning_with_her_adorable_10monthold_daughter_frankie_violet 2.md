Jennifer Hawkins and Jake Wall welcomed their first child together, daughter Frankie Violet, in October last year.

And on Tuesday, the former Miss Universe looked every inch the doting parent as she cuddled up to her 10-month-old baby girl.

Uploading a photo to her Instagram account, the 36-year-old model revealed it was a 'cuddly morning' as Frankie rested on her.

Little Frankie looked super cute in a white singlet top and pink Adidas tracksuits, while mum Jennifer was pictured from her waist down in grey track pants.

This comes after Jennifer recently revealed she is planning to wean her baby off breastfeeding in the coming months.

'I currently breastfeed Frankie, but will move to toddler milk after her first birthday,' Jennifer told Daily Mail Australia.

In her first brand partnership as a new mother, Jennifer has signed on to be the new face of Bubs Australia, which was founded by fellow Sydney mum, Kristy Carr.  

The Australian icon is officially the first-ever global face of Bubs. 

'As a new mother it was a huge decision what brand to choose and trust when I was introducing solids to Frankie,' Jennifer explained.

Jennifer expressed her desire to start a family in September 2018, following her departure from Myer after 12 years as the department store's ambassador.

Speaking at her final runway show for the retailer, she told the Herald Sun: 'I'd love to have a family, it's taking the time to look ahead. I want to have the time to be able to do that.'

Jennifer married property developer Jake in Bali, Indonesia in 2013, after eight years of dating.

The pair broke with tradition and gave their daughter both her mother's maiden name, Hawkins, and her father's surname, Wall.
