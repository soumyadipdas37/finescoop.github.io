Ariel Winter let her candyfloss hair flutter free in the breeze when she was glimpsed out in Los Angeles this weekend. 

The 22-year-old Modern Family alumna slipped into a tie-dye T-shirt that featured a sci-fi chic color combo of black and neon green.

She made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Slipping into a pair of black trousers she rounded off the ensemble with flip flops that showed off her black toenail polish.

Amid the coronavirus lockdowns Ariel has been hunkering down with her dashing 25-year-old boyfriend Luke Benward.

The showbiz hot couple have also been joined by Ariel's beloved quartet of dogs, Chloe, Casper, Cash and Cleo.

Early this May Ariel revealed that she accidentally sliced off the tip of her left thumb while making Greek food.

She dished that when she was in the hospital she was handed a bag without being told her thumb tip was inside.

As a result she tossed the bag into the garbage and was forced to go back and retrieve it, the Modern Family star dished on Access.

Before she took up with her current smoldering hunk Ariel spent years dating little-known actor Levi Meaden, 32.

She told Refinery29 in 2017 of her romance with Levi, with its dramatic age gap: 'I'm happy, and whatever people want to say, they can say.'

Ariel, whose figure had drawn its share of online trolling, said: 'He's always complimenting me and making me feel special and beautiful.'
