Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has revealed that there are no issues between himself and Lionel Messi following this summer's transfer saga.

The Argentine superstar told Barcelona, via fax, he wanted to leave the Nou Camp this summer but performed a dramatic U-turn by announcing he would stay at the club this season.

Koeman, who was appointed manager in August following the dismissal of Quique Setien, has shed light on on the story that dominated football and his relationship with the club's star man.

Ronald Koeman has revealed that there are no issues between himself and Lionel Messi 

'That has passed me reasonably well,' he told Fox Sports.

'That was mainly a conflict between Messi and the club. 

'I have spoken to Messi since then and we will continue as usual.'
