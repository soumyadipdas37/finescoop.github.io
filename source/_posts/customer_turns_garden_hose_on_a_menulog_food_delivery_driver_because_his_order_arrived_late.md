A hungry customer hosed down his Menulog delivery driver after his food order arrived 'late and cold'. 

The FIFO worker filmed himself drenching the man when he showed up to deliver KFC to his home in Fremantle in Western Australia on Wednesday night.

He has been permanently banned from using the food delivery service after posting video of the incident on Facebook. 

Footage published online shows him berating the driver as he hoses him down

'Yeah next time, on time man,' the customer says.

'Yeah, yeah thank you, I will remember,' the driver responds.

The customer then orders him to leave.

'Ok bye, have a good night,' the driver said.

'Get out of here. F***ing chicken's cold,' the customers responds angrily.

A spokesperson for Menulog condemned the customer's behaviour.

'It is an atrocious abuse of an important member of our community who is providing an essential service,' the spokesperson said.

The customer has since apologised for his behaviour which he said was 'out of character'.

'I regret my actions last night, I reached out to Menulog this morning to try and get in contact with the driver to apologise,' he told Seven News. 

The father-of-two handed himself in to police on Thursday morning when he woke to thousands of threats after publishing the video.

'I feel embarrassed and I'm just sorry,' he said. 

Western Australia Police Acting Commisioner Gary Dreibergs criticised the attack on an essential worker. 

'People should never be in fear when doing their job, people should be totally at liberty to go about and do whatever it is they wish to do,'  he told Nine News.
