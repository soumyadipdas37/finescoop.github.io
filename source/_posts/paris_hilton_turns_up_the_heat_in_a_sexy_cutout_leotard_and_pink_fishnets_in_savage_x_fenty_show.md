She never fails to impress with her striking fashion ensembles.

And Paris Hilton was sure to turn up the heat as she rocked a pink cut-out leotard during Rihanna's Savage x Fenty show on Thursday.

The hotel heiress, 39, put on a sultry display as she flaunted her sensational figure in the slinky lingerie and a pair of bright pink fishnet tights.

Wow! Paris Hilton looked sensational as she struck a sultry pose in a cut-out leotard and pink fishnet tights during Rihanna's Savage x Fenty show on Thursday

Paris exuded confidence at the event, making sure to work all of her angles as she showed off the eye-catching look.

She styled her locks into an enormous 80s-inspired hair do, letting her blonde tresses cascade over her shoulders.

The beauty also rocked a full face of makeup, including a slick of pink lipstick, before adding some Noughties-esque sunglasses to her ensemble.

Never one to forgo a chance to add some sparkle, Paris jazzed up her outfit with dazzling silver jewellery and a shimmering detail on her heels.

Work it: The heiress flaunted her toned figure, flashing her taut midriff in the cut-out lingerie 

As well as wowing in pink, Paris was also spotted posing up a storm in a black corset and semi-sheer mini skirt as she arrived at the show.

She kept with the fishnet theme for her second look, but went for a more classic pair of black knee-high stockings. 

Also seen during the show-studded event were models Bella Hadid, Irina Shayk and Cara Delevingne who all impressed in a selection of lingerie.

Rihanna's Savage X Fenty show will be broadcast on Amazon Prime video on Friday, October 2.

Behind the scenes it seemed safety was the number one priority as the crew was spotted in masks and protective face shields.

Although it seemed some of the models weren't akin to the rules of social distancing as they posed together backstage. 

Rihanna also told People that part of organising the show was ensured that all of the models were safe in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

She said: 'It was a completely different process this year. We had to work around the challenges of COVID-19, keeping everyone safe and their health at the top of our list. It forced us to figure out new ways to produce a show.

'We had to figure out ways to make this feel as visually enthusiastic as possible. I’m excited, and I’m proud of my team — we pulled it off."

Forbes revealed in 2019 that Rihanna — who's real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty — is the richest female musical artist.

The Diamonds singer's $600 million net worth has eclipsed the fortunes earned by her peers Beyonce, Madonna and Celine Dion, according to the publication. 

In addition to her fashion ventures, Rihanna dipped into the world of cosmetics in 2017 with Fenty Beauty, a company which accrued nearly $570m in revenue in 2018.
