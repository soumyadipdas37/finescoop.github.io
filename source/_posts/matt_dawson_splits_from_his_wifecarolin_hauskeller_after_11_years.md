Matt Dawson and his wife have split after 11 years.

The A Question of Sport team captain - who is to depart the role later this year alongside fellow captain Phil Tufnell, and presenter Sue Barker - took to Twitter to reveal his marriage to Carolin Hauskeller has ended, but the pair will continue to co-parent their sons, Alex and Sami.

He wrote: 'We know this will be a surprise to most but after 11 years together Carolin and I have decided our relationship needs a new direction, bringing our marriage to an end. The love for our beautiful boys grows stronger day by day as does our friendship as co-parents.

'To our dear friends please continue to support us as positively as you can for the next stage of our lives. It's vital that Alex and Sami understand that we will always be a united family.'

Earlier this month, former England rugby union star Matt admitted he will miss being on 'A Question of Sport' 'immensely', after it was confirmed the trio will be departing the quiz show.

He wrote: 'Thanks for all the lovely messages. I'm not sure how to respond so I'll have a think Thinking face Needless to say I will miss @QuestionofSport immensely....(sic)'

Matt's fellow team captain, former England cricketer Phil, said he will miss the show 'hugely'.

He tweeted: '13 yrs @QuestionofSport has been a great part of life .. going to miss it hugely .. thanks so much for all the lovely messages !! (sic)'

Presenter Sue said: 'I love the show so much they would have to remove me, it would have been tough for me to walk away, I've absolutely loved my 24 years fronting 'A Question Of Sport', it's been my dream job.

'But I understand the BBC want to take the show in a new direction and I'm sad to say goodbye.'
