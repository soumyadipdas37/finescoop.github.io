He released his new song and music video, Holy, in the early minutes of Friday. 

And just hours later, Justin Bieber headed out in West Hollywood for a meet and greet, and watched as a large group of fans danced to the song in-front of a firehouse. 

The 26-year-old pop star kept his distance from the group as they performed but did pose maskless with the large group despite the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Meet up: Justin Bieber headed out in Los Angeles, hours after releasing his new song Holy, for a meet and greet with fans, on Friday

The Sorry hitmaker looked stylish for the outing as he donned black slacks with a white short-sleeve textured shirt that he left un-buttoned revealing a simple white tank underneath. 

He paired the look with grey and white Nike sneakers, a green cap with a red and yellow emblem reading 'butter,' and a gold watch. 

As he watched the group from the edge of the sidewalk, he pulled a black face mask down to his chin.

As the group danced, Justin flashed up a peace-sign with his fingers as he rested against a light post. 

The meet and greet, and accompanying dance routine, appeared to be filmed for a project Justin is working on.  

After the performance, the Canadian-born singer greeted the large group and posed for pictures. 

Despite local regulations limiting gathering of large groups over 10 people, more than a dozen fans were present and posed in a tight group with the singer.

Though, at one point the singer did pull up his mask for a photo, after standing in incredibly close distance with those who had theirs down. 

In his new music video for Holy, directed by Colin Tilley, Justin stars, as a struggling oil miner who is laid-off and evicted, while his on-screen love interest Ryan Destiny, a nurse, finds out her beloved patient died. 

The new song reunites the Sorry singer with his I'm the One collaborator Chance the Rapper, who also appears in the video. 

Justin's new video appears to be at least partly inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, as his character is laid-off due to a 'global situation.'

While his song seems to be inspired by his relationship with wife Hailey Bieber, who he initially after just months of dating in 2018. 

'On God / Runnin' to the altar like a track star,' he sings. 'Can't wait another second.'  

Then things take a turn for the worse, as the music stops, Justin and his co-workers gather around to be informed the plant is shutting down due to a 'global situation.' 

As the song resume, the lyrics continue to seem to be personal to the Never Say Never hitmaker 'They say we're too young and / The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin" / Wise men say fools rush in / But I don't know.'

The release of Holy marks a 'new era,' for Justin as he tweeted 'New era. New single. It begins,' while promoting the song.  

Justin first teased new music was coming on September 11, writing 'one week' on all of his social media accounts sending fans guessing new music was coming on the 18th. 

'See you at the premiere. It's a movie @ColinTilley. #HOLY with @chancetherapper' Bieber - who boasts 415.6M social media followers - tweeted.

The former YouTube sensation plays a construction worker in the clip directed by Tilley, who also helmed Cardi B's WAP video, and it also features NCIS star Wilmer Valderrama as a soldier.

Justin's onscreen leading lady is played by Grown-ish star Ryan Destiny, who famously won a 2011 singing contest to attend the red carpet premiere of his concert film Never Say Never. 

Justin last released his fifth studio album, Changes, on February 14 which debuted at the top of the Billboard Hot 200. 

The album became Bieber's seventh number one, making him the youngest to accomplish the time at 25-years-old. The record was previously held by Elvis Presley at age 26.

Changes spawned his Billboard Hot 100 number two, Yummy, and he was expected to tour the album from May to September with Kehlani and Jaden Smith, though dates were scheduled to 2021 due to the pandemic. 

For additional album promotion he also starred in the Justin Bieber: Seasons, 10-episode documentary series on Youtube where he discussed the pressure he had early in his career to be successful.  

Prior to his fifth studio album, he last released Purpose in 2015 and toured from 2016 until 2017 before ending tour early to focus on his mental health.  After a very long break from music, he returned to the stage for surprise performance at Coachella during Ariana Grande's headlining set in April 2019.
