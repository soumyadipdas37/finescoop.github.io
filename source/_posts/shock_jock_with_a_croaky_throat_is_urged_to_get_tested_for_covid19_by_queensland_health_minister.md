A radio host was told to get tested for COVID-19 by health authorities because he had a 'croaky throat'.

Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles gave the advice to 97.3FM host Terry Hansen live on air last month.

Mr Miles was responding to a question from Hansen's co-host Robin Bailey around whether her colleague should even be at work. 

He was exhibiting no other symptoms.

'We'd really love if he would, we'd love if he'd go and get a test and then go home, even though it's probably not COVID,' Mr Miles said. 

'Even if it isn't, it really helps us keep our testing rates up and it's those testing rates that can help us make sure that there isn't other symptomatic COVID out there that we don't know about.'

But when the state's Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk experienced similar symptoms she waited two days before getting a test done.

Palaszczuk apologised for losing her voice during an online forum on Monday night, reported the Courier Mail.

At the time she insisted she was suffering from voice strain due to last week's parliamentary sitting.

On Tuesday she went to the funeral of Mackay MP Tim Mulherin's.

The following day she attended events across regional Queensland then visited a doctor after arriving in Brisbane on Wednesday night. 

Her COVID-19 test came back negative on Thursday.

Ms Palaszczuk has since said it was very clear she had just lost her voice.

Treasurer Cameron Dick told reporters the premier's results had come back negative.

'The premier lost her voice ... she had a COVID test that came back negative, so she's done the right thing, she's listened to the health advice, she's obeyed the science and the science that informs the health advice and that's the appropriate thing for Queenslanders to do,' Mr Dick said.

LNP health spokeswoman Ros Bates accused the premier of being reckless and not taking her own health advice.

'I'm glad to hear the Premier tested negative to COVID, but it raises many questions,' Ms Bates said.

'The official advice is that if people are feeling unwell they should get tested.

'It appears the Premier has done neither and contradicted her own advice after being tested on Wednesday night – two days after having symptoms.'



Meanwhile Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young confirmed on Friday a croaky throat doesn't warrant a COVID-19 test.

'She was ultra-cautious, and that is what I ask of every Queenslander,' she said.

'Although there was no need for her to do it she went and got herself tested.' 

She said residents need to look at their own personal circumstances when considering whether or not they should get a health check. 

'But I would encourage them to as the Premier did, that if you've got a symptom it's a good idea to go and get tested rather than think through, 'Is it COVID, isn't it COVID?', just get yourself tested,' she said.
