Australia's horrific 2019 bushfire season left significant portions of the country devastated and gutted by flames.  

But for Turia Pitt, the experience was personal, as it triggered memories of the injuries she sustained in fire in 2011. 

Speaking to Body and Soul magazine this week, the 33-year-old said she had to find ways to cope.

'Having been burnt before I was really terrified, but what I like to do when I start spending too much time in my own head is to ask what I can do to be of service,' she said. 

Turia added: 'Giving back and helping others is a really effective way to boost your own happiness. 

'It makes you realise all of the things you should be grateful for and it just makes you feel good.'

 She added that she has hard days: 'I try not to beat myself up. Life is full of ups and downs. We have hard times, but the reverse is also true, and I think part of being happy is accepting that you're not going to be happy all the time,' she said

She added that she has hard days, too, but has found a way to see the bright side. 

'I try not to beat myself up. Life is full of ups and downs. We have hard times, but the reverse is also true, and I think part of being happy is accepting that you're not going to be happy all the time,' she said.
