She had to take a pause on filming Riverdale's fourth season due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Now Lili Reinhart says she feels 'like a prisoner' as she has resumed filming the CW series in Vancouver, Canada. 

The 23-year-old actress expressed misgivings about returning north of the border to film her popular series in a new Nylon profile.

Lili has said she’s less than thrilled about the idea, as it means she 'cannot leave Canada' and won’t be able to visit her family for Thanksgiving in November.

She also lamented having to fit into a prom dress she wore in an episode before filming was halted, because she’s 'a little bit thicker' than she was before the pandemic.

'We stopped during the prom episode, so I have to fit back in that prom dress. Five months later, we’re all going to be tan, maybe a little bit thicker. I certainly am,' she said.

'I genuinely feel like a prisoner, going back to work, because I cannot leave Canada. That doesn’t feel good. You can’t go home for Thanksgiving, can’t visit your family. No one can come visit you unless they quarantine for two weeks. It just feels f*****.'

Despite her grievances, Lili acknowledged she is 'very lucky' to have the show to return to as other people have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic.

The blonde beauty also spoke about her battle with depression and anxiety, explaining that she 'felt very lost' at the start of the health crisis.

'I felt very sad and hopeless, because of personal things that were happening in my life,' she admitted. 

'Instead of distracting myself, f**king random people and doing drugs and drinking my problems away, I chose the harder route, which was to not distract myself. I was like, "I’m not doing that. I’m going to go through the next however many months of s**t, pure s**t, awful, crying every day, but the necessary work."'

Lili and her costars are set to finish filming the final three episodes of season four, before beginning immediately on season five, which while take place seven years in the future as they leave their high school days behind them.

They'll have to quarantine separately for two weeks before filming starts, and once they begin filming they'll work until after Christmas.

Lili also spoke more about her bisexuality, which she revealed back in June.

'I didn’t date girls until I was… right now,' she said. 'I’d been with a girl when I was 18. This part of my life was never intentionally hidden. My friends and family knew. My cast members knew. 

'I didn't want to come out and talk about it because I felt that bisexuality was becoming a trend [among celebrities], but I’ve supported the LGBTQ community since I was a little tween, and it just felt organic. I was like, "F**k it. Now’s the time. It’s not something I’m ashamed of. Hey, you. I’m going to be at this protest for LGBTQs for BLM. Come join me.'

In May, it was confirmed that Lili and her costar boyfriend Cole Sprouse had split after filming was shutdown due to the pandemic.

The on–off couple reportedly separated due to the distance between them, as they chose to quarantine separately.

Lili plays Betty, the sometime love interest of Archie (KJ Apa), while Cole plays Archie's friend Jughead.
