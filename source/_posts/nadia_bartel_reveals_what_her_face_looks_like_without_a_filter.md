She's forged a successful career as a brand ambassador and fashion designer.

And on Sunday, Nadia Bartel used her platform for good, encouraging her Instagram fans to embrace their natural beauty.

On her Stories, the ex-wife of AFL star Jimmy Bartel revealed what her face looks like 'without a filter', and said she's going to make a conscious effort to use them less.

Sitting inside a modern room in her Melbourne home, Nadia cut a casual figure in a pale pink sweater.

Her fair locks were styled out and in soft waves, framing her striking facial features.

The mother-of-two appeared to sport just a light coating of makeup, drawing attention to her radiant complexion.

Candid confession: The fashion designer went on to joke that at times, she has 'pretty much forgotten' what her face looks like without a filter. Pictured with a filter

Opting to go without a filter, Nadia told her followers: 'We can get so used to swiping across and using the filters, so I'm really trying to not use them as much.'

The influencer went on to joke that at times, she has 'pretty much forgotten' what her face looks like without a filter.  

After sharing a few of her beauty product recommendations, Nadia shared a before and after of her skin, with and without a filter.

Choosing a flattering filter that made her skin appear flawless, she said: 'Look at this difference with a filter on my face. [I] can get used to looking like that.'

Not reality: 'We have to also remember that there's a lot of younger impressionable girls on Instagram and social media, and they may not realise filters are being used,' she stressed. Pictured in a prior Instagram post 

Then revealing the 'real' Nadia, the entrepreneur said she was going to make a conscious effort to use the filters less, and embrace her natural beauty. 

'We have to also remember that there's a lot of younger impressionable girls on Instagram and social media, and they may not realise filters are being used,' she stressed. 'It just sets up a really warped version of reality.'  

Nadia is a popular social media figure with a 580,000-plus following on Instagram.
