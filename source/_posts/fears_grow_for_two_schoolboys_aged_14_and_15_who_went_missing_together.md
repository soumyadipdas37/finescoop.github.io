Fears are growing for two schoolboys, aged 15 and 14, who have been missing from their Oxfordshire homes for nearly a week.

Cameron Gianni, who is 15-years-old and from Didcot, and Daniel Jones, 14, from Benson, were last seen on September 8 and are believed to be together. 

Daniel is described as white, around 5foot 8inches tall with short blond hair.  

He was last seen wearing grey tracksuit bottoms and a grey sports sweatshirt with a white school shirt and dark green Nike Air trainers. 

Cameron is also white, around 5foot 10inches tall with short brown hair. He usually wears a black tracksuit and may be carrying a black rucksack.

They are both known to frequent Wallingford, Didcot, Chilton, Benson and Oxford.

Inspector Roger Lamboll, based at Abingdon police station, said: 'We're naturally very concerned for Cameron and Daniel, who have not been seen now for almost one week.

'I would appeal to anybody who knows of their whereabouts to please get in touch with police by calling 101, quoting reference number 43200281794.

'I would also appeal directly to Cameron and Daniel. If you see this message, please contact either the police or your families. You are not in any trouble, but we are concerned for you and want to know that you are safe.

'I believe that both Cameron and Daniel can be quite active on social media, and so if anybody has any clues as to where they may be, please get in touch with us.' 

Thames Valley Police took to Twitter to appeal for information about the two missing boys
