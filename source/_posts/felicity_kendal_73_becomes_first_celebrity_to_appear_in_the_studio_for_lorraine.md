Felicity Kendal became the first celebrity to come into the studio on Lorraine, as she made an appearance during Monday's edition of the show.

The actress, 73, showed off her mask to begin with as host Lorraine Kelly admitted the crew had done 'all the preparations' to make sure it was safe for her to come in.

Felicity was on hand to discuss her new show with Blue Cross, and said she was delighted to be in the studio as she said: 'It's so lovely talking to you not on Zoom.'

The actress joked that she was 'covered in sanitiser' during her appearance, as she kept her mask on her because she wasn't allowed to put it on any surfaces without it being sanitised itself.

Felicity also went on to speak about plastic surgery, Lorraine said she considered getting botox because of how well the actress looked with the procedure as she claimed: 'You only need a little bit very rarely.'

However, Felicity was clear that exercise was also a reason for her youthful features, as she added: 'I do yoga and weight, that's really important because bones get weak and crumbly.

'Yoga, stretching, and walking, all [things] you can do outside you don't need a gym membership.'

Last year Miss Kendal, who played Barbara Good in 1970s sitcom The Good Life, revealed to Sunday Times magazine that she is a fan of Botox. 'I do it every six months, then you don't get the terrible little frown line.'

However the grandmother-of-two recently revealed she has given up Botox and instead relies on yoga, pilates and weightlifting to stay youthful. 

She told Good Housekeeping magazine: ‘There comes a point where you have to match bits of you with the other bits.’   

While she's never had a face-lift, the actress has had fillers around her mouth.

Felicity explained: 'Then there was a time when you'd think, I'm over 60, I can't possibly wear a short skirt again because of my crinkly knees.

'Then you come out the other end and say, f*** it, I've got good legs, I'm going to put on tights and a short skirt.' 

Felicity became a beloved household name starring in The Good Life, despite running for just 30 episodes over four series.
