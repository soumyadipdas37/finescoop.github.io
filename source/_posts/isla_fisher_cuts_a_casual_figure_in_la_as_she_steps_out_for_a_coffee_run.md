Australian actress Isla Fisher cut a casual figure when she stepped out in Los Angeles on Sunday.

The 44-year-old was spotted picking up coffee and takeaway from popular cafe, Alfred. 

Isla also wore a face mask to protect herself amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Wedding Crashers star sported a pair of navy track pants featuring colourful stripes down the side and a pink T-shirt. 

She paired the look with white sandals and a black cross-body bag, while shading her eyes with a pair of sunglasses. 

The mother-of-three swept her long red locks up into a messy bun and appeared to be wearing minimal makeup.

Coffee run: The 44-year-old was spotted picking up coffee and takeaway from popular cafe, Alfred 

She left the cafe with two coffees and was also carrying what may have been food in a brown paper bag.  

Isla found fame starring on Home and Away, before landing roles in several Hollywood blockbusters, including Confessions of a Shopaholic and The Great Gatsby.

She currently has three films in post-production, Blithe Spirit, Godmothered and Unplugging - but fans will no doubt be keen to see if she's landed a role in the surprise Borat sequel.

The flamed-haired beauty has been married to comedian and filmmaker Sacha Baron Cohen, 48, since 2010, and back in 2016 they collaborated on his action comedy, Grimsby.

Sacha's most famous film, Borat is now set to get a sequel - which has already been filmed and screened for 'a select few industry types,' according to a new report from Collider.

The sequel reportedly follows Cohen's Borat, who, after the release of the 2006 Borat film, thinks he's a huge movie star.
