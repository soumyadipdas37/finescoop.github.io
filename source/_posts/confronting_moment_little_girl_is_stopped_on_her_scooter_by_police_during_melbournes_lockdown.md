A little girl was stopped on her scooter and her family questioned by police during Melbourne's tough lockdown.  

The confronting footage was captured by mother-of-four Julie Hollis while her family were out on their daily walk around Footscray, west of Melbourne's CBD.  

Her daughter Elsie, five, was stopped mid-ride as Victoria Police officers checked identification to make sure the family were within 5km of their home.

Victoria Police officers stopped the Hollis family (Mr Hollis and daughter Elsie pictured) at a park in Footscray, west of Melbourne CBD, to make sure they were following coronavirus rules

'We drove down to Footscray park to go for a walk and scooter ride with the kids. It wasn’t scary as we knew police had been in the area.

'We were kind of expecting we may be asked. But as we knew we were within our 5km we were okay about it,' Mrs Hollis told Daily Mail Australia.    

Melburnians are battling through their tenth week of strict stay-at-home coronavirus measures and are only permitted to exercise for one hour per day. 

Mrs Hollis, her husband Mark Hollis, and kids Leo, 13, Wilbur, 9, Edmund, 5, and Elsie often visit the park to get out of their house. 

'The police officers we dealt with were really friendly and respectful during the process. 

'Our oldest two boys were a bit nervous about it and asked questions but the little ones just wanted to know what they were asking,' Mrs Hollis explained.   

The mum and husband, who supply medical staff at festivals, have only been asked for their identification one time.    

Victoria Police officers and Australian Defence Force personnel conduct regular patrols throughout Melbourne to ensure restrictions are being followed.   

'It’s crazy, we can only leave the house for four reasons,' Mrs Hollis said.  

Melbourne is currently under a strict stage 4 coronavirus lockdown. The Hollis family have been keeping busy with bike rides, baking (Elsie and Edmund pictured) and online school

These essential reasons include exercise, providing or receiving care, one household member going shopping and work.

Melburnians are also under a strict curfew and must stay inside between 8pm and 5am every night. 

Individuals who fail to self-isolate or follow coronavirus laws can be hit with a $1,652 on-the-spot fine. 

It is also mandatory for all Victorians to wear a face covering in public unless they are exercising or have a valid medical condition.     

Mrs Hollis said her family were 'all over' the harsh restrictions. 

'Especially the kids not being able to do face to face school with their teachers. 

'The younger ones all go to a catholic school and every morning in prayer at least one little prep kid says “I pray for coronavirus to go away so we can go back to school.”

'They all miss their friends and the playgrounds,' the mother-of-four said. 

Mrs Hollis said the family spent lots of time together to pass the long hours at home.   

'We mostly play games, take the dog for a walk, bike rides, scooter rides, play iPads, playstation and watch movies,' she explained.   

Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Melbourne's Stage Four restrictions.

‘Everything is on the table,’ he admitted. ‘It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.’ 

He is preparing to announce the government's plan for a pathway out of the current lockdown on Sunday and will release separate roadmaps for Melbourne and regional Victoria.   

Victoria announced 113 new cases and 15 additional deaths on Thursday, marking a second day of an increase in cases.
