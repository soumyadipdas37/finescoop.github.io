Thanks to her longstanding career in the fashion world, she always knows how to dress to impress.

And Helena Christensen put on a stylish display as she stepped out to walk her dog Kuma in New York City's West Village on Thursday.

The Danish supermodel, 51, looked sensational in a pink dress that had a quirky, colourful pattern, and she protected herself amid the coronavirus crisis by wearing a matching pink mask.

Helena's ensemble accentuated her slender legs as she strolled in a pair of pink sandals that complemented her look.

The brunette beauty pulled her locks into tight bun atop her head, while she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion.

Helena finished off her look by wearing an array of glittering jewellery, including a gold chain necklace and ankle bracelets. 

Seemingly only heading out for a short walk Helena could be seen carrying her keys in one hand, rather than carrying a bag around with her.

Last month, Helena revealed that spending lockdown with her 20-year-old son Mingus had been 'really special'.

The model quarantined with her only child and close friends at her home in the Catskills, in upstate New York.

Speaking with The Telegraph, she explained how they passed time going on treks and watching films, adding that 'being in nature saved me physically and mentally'.

Helena said: 'I was lucky to spend months on end [in lockdown] with close friends and my son Mingus.... it was very special.

'I think nature saved me physically and mentally. Being in nature I realise is as important to me as breathing.’  

Helena shares her son with her ex-partner the American actor Norman Reedus, who is known for his role in The Walking Dead. The couple were together for five years but split in 2003. 

Mingus, who is with the Unsigned Group modelling agency, is also making a name for himself in the fashion industry after walking in several high profile runway shows.
