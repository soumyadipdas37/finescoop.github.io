She's been outspoken about her political beliefs in the lead-up to the 2020 general election.

And Eva Longoria stuck to her guns on Wednesday as she joined a caravan of cars in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood to support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' candidacy for president and vice president.

The 45-year-old Desperate Housewives star was joined in the caravan by her friend, Republican strategist and CNN political commentator Ana Navarro, who is also supporting Biden and Harris in the election.

Eva kept her look casual and functional while speaking with fans and Biden supporters on the rainy day.

She wore a simple white T-shirt that read 'Vote' in colorful letters. 

The actress kept her shirt tucked into her figure-hugging white jeans, which she wore with a white belt, and she stayed on theme with a pair of white trainers.

She wore her brunette tresses parted down the middle and cascading over her shoulders, and she helped slow the spread of the novel coronavirus by wearing a black mask that said, 'Biden.'

Joining Eva in her large black Lincoln SUV was her friend Ana, who wore a green blouse with dark pants and also sported a mask.

Though she's a Republican strategist, Navarro has criticized President Donald Trump for comments he made on the Access Hollywood tape about sexually assaulting women, and she also called him a racist for remarks he has made about immigrants and the Latin community.

She was subsequently labeled a 'Never Trumper' for her disdain of the president, and she voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and is supporting Joe Biden in the upcoming contest. 

Despite their usually conflicting political views, Eva and Ana have been friends for years, and the Devious Maids producer attended Ana's wedding in March 2019 to Republican Party operative Al Cárdenas.

The FiveThirtyEight average of recent Florida polls show Biden with a slim lead over Trump in the state.

Eva has continued to share her political views on social media and has repeatedly urged her 8 million Instagram followers to vote for the Democratic nominee.

Earlier this month, she shared a mirror selfie featuring her impressive abs as she reminded her followers to register to vote.

This month also marked the start of her digital platform She Se Puede, which she starred with activists to 'inspire, affirm, and inform Latinas so they can leverage their power to transform their lives, their families, their community and their nation.'

Missing from Eva's day in the caravan was her husband José Bastón and their two-year-old son Santiago.

The couple also didn't meet, after José initially refused a blind date with her that was set up by a mutual friend because of his busy schedule.

But the two still got together and hit things off, and they announced their engagement in December 2015, before tying the knot in May 2016.
