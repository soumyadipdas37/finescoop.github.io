Jared Keith Hodgson is from Conder in south Canberra

A drunk tradie who led police on a high-speed car chase claims he was forced to drive home because he ate a curry so spicy it made him poo his pants.

Jared Keith Hodgson, from Conder in south Canberra, told the ACT Magistrates Court on Tuesday that he was at a friend's place when he was served a spicy curry.

The 30-year-old panel beater said he does not usually eat chili and 'defecated myself at her house,' The Daily Telegraph reported.

He also claimed he had three beers before dinner and two more as he ate the hot meal.

Court documents showed that Hodgson sped down both lanes of Ashley Drive in Gowrie in his Mitsubishi Lancer before he caught the attention of police.

Officers hit speeds of 130km/h during the chase and believe the tradesman drove faster.

After speeding through a roundabout Hodgson crashed into a gutter and jettisoned over a traffic island, leaving  a trail of skidmarks.

He then stopped for police on Ellerston Ave Isabella Plains.

Court documents said: 'The defendant’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, he was unsteady on his feet, slurring his words, smelt strongly of intoxicated liquor and had defecated himself.'

When breathalyzed, Hodgson blew 0.145 - six times the legal limit. 

He pleaded guilty to driving unregistered, unlicensed and uninsured, as well as mid-range drunk driving and negligent driving.

Magistrate Margaret Hunter said the decision to drink drive 'had nothing to do' with soiling himself.

She added: 'His behaviour in terms of his driving was clearly a result of his intoxication.' 

He was convicted, fined $1,600 and banned from driving for three months.
