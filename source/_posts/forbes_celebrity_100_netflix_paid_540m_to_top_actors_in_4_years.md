Netflix has paid $540million to top grossing actors since 2016 – surpassing the money competitors Disney’s Marvel, Apple and Amazon have doled out, according to Forbes' 2020 Celebrity 100 list.

In the past year alone Netflix, Apple and Amazon paid stars on the list $300million, Netflix accounting for two thirds of that payout.

Netflix along with Apple and Amazon have salary commitments of more than $100million teed up for next year’s list as the streaming TV and movie industry continues to boom.

Some of Netflix’s most popular programs so far in 2020 include Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, which spent a record-shattering 27 consecutive days at number one on Forbes' popularity ranking system.

Tiger King is followed by Ozark, Outer Banks, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and reality show Love is Blind in popularity.

Overall the world’s highest-paid celebrities earned a combined $6.1billion before taxes and fees from June 2019 through May 2020 – a $200million drop from 2019.  

In the past year alone Netflix, Apple and Amazon paid stars on the list $300million, Netflix accounting for two thirds of that payout. Over the past four years Netflix has paid $540million to top grossing actors since 2016, more than Disney's Marvel, Apple and Amazon

The coronavirus pandemic likely played a part as it forced stadiums to close, postponed movie debuts, and cancelled concerts, putting a dent in the incomes of athletes and entertainers. 

According to the 2020 Celebrity 100 list released in June, a dozen actors and actresses raked in a combined $624million a year – but a majority was pocketed by male actors. 

This year’s top actors list has just two women: Sofia Vergara, who sits at number 71 on the list and earned half her income from endorsements and licensing, and Angelina Jolie who sits at number 99 on the list.

On this year's Forbes Celebrity 100 list actors earned significantly more than women, raking in 545.5million, compared to actresses pocketing $78.5million. 

It’s a slump from 2019 when top paid actresses made together $99million. In 2016 top actresses raked in $122million.

She has a real time net worth of $900million.

It comes after her scandal where she appeared on Forbes Billionaires list in March 2019 at the age of 21. Forbes later accused the Jenner family of inflating figures and 'forging' tax returns for the make-up mogul’s cosmetics company.

The reality star denied the report shortly after, tweeting: 'what am i even waking up to. i thought this was a reputable site..'

'all i see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. i’ve never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. period'

She followed up with a quote from the Forbes report that accused the Jenners and their accountant of producing false tax returns.
