Shannen Doherty wants to record video messages for her loved ones to watch after she has passed away.

The Charmed star is currently battling stage four breast cancer, and has admitted that while she wants to prepare for her passing by writing letters and recording video messages for her family, she hasn't been able to because the process feels too 'final.'

The 49-year-old actress still feels like a 'very healthy human being' and is confident she'll live another '10 or 15 years', so doesn't want to write her final messages too soon she told Elle.

'I haven't sat down to write letters,' said the Beverly Hills, 90210 star. 'That's something I need to do.'

She added, 'There are things I need to say to my mom. I want my husband to know what he's meant to me. But whenever it comes time for me to do it, it feels so final. It feels like you're signing off, and I'm not signing off.'

Her husband is photographer Kurt Iswarienko. 

The brunette beauty added that she does not feel like her life will end soon. 

'I feel like I'm a very, very healthy human being,' said Shannen. 'It's hard to wrap up your affairs when you feel like you're going to live another 10 or 15 years.'

The Heathers actress revealed her stage four cancer diagnosis in February this year, three years after going into remission from her first battle with the illness.

And the star says she is not ready to be 'put out to pasture' just yet, as she still has 'a lot of life' in her.

She added: 'It's like anybody with Stage IV faces this sort of thing, where others want to put you out to pasture. I'm not ready for pasture. I've got a lot of life in me.'

Now, Doherty is keen to 'treasure all the small moments' in her life.

She told the magazine: 'I try to treasure all the small moments that most people don't really see or take for granted. The small things are magnified for me. 

'We have this endless well within us, and it's just about continuing to dig in that well for the strength to face adversity - and so that we can also see all the beauty.'

In March Doherty slammed those who are not social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.

She is furious that some people aren't sticking to the guidelines to remain two metres apart from people in public spaces, especially for those who are classed as vulnerable with underlying health conditions like herself.

For my fellow cancer warriors who fight hard everyday for more time. For my mom. For my family. For my husband. For my mother in law and father in law. For my friends. For my friends kids. For every single one of you.'

The brunette beauty added: 'For myself with stage 4 cancer, my battle is hard enough. For one of my closest friend of over 28 years who has decided to end her battle with metastatic cancer and is in the hospital for the last time alone. For every doctor and hospital worker. 

'For every person at a grocery store doing their best to help. For every person forced to be on the front lines. I'm doing this for us. Please join me. #stayhome.'

The star also said she was 'embracing every day' amid her cancer battle.

And although she has days where she is 'depressed' or feeling 'plain lazy', she manages to 'push through' with the help of her close circle of friends.

One way she has been spending her time is by hiking and cooking healthy meals with her pals, which she admitted has made her feel 'alive'.

In a tribute to her friends and giving an update on her battle with the disease, Shannen wrote on Instagram: 'After a year of dealing with cancer coming back and other stresses, I'm back at it. Taking care of myself and embracing every day. It's not always easy. I have days I'm depressed or just plain lazy. But I push thru with the help of friends.

'@annemkortright has been relentless in getting me to hike and learning new ways to cook that feed my soul as well as my tummy but in a very healthy way.'
