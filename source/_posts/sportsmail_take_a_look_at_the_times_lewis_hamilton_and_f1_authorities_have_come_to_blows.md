Lewis Hamilton has found himself embroiled in yet another tussle with the F1 authorities after he threatened to break the sport's anti-politics rule.

The six-time world champion, who leads this year's championship by 55 points, wore a T-shirt carrying the slogan, 'Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor', on the podium at Mugello a fortnight ago — a reference to the death of a black medical worker who was shot multiple times during a botched drugs raid in Louisville, Kentucky, back in March.

After looking into the apparent breach of the FIA's non-political regulations, the sport's governing body will 'clarify' what can be worn ahead of Sunday's race, where the Briton can match Michael Schumacher's record of 91 Formula One victories.

This is not the first time Hamilton has locked horns with the FIA during his illustrious F1 career, after numerous disagreements and accusations have created a frosty relationship over the years.

Here, Sportsmail take a look at the times Hamilton and the F1 authorities have come to blows.

Hamilton will not be stopped in his Black Lives Matter protesting

The Brit has been the leading figure for the sport in their campaigning and support towards anti-racism and the Black Lives Matter movement.

He was instrumental in getting drivers to take a knee before each race and has worn several different items of clothing and had his race gear branded with slogans and logos in support of ending racial inequality. 

Recently, he wore a t-shirt that read 'Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor' - which has triggered the FIA to look into their anti-politics regulations and Sportsmail expect Hamilton will be told he cannot wear crusading messages whilst on the podium, but may be able to when taking a knee.  

Hamilton remained defiant that he will continue to protest in response to the FIA, as he said: 'Lots of rules have been written for me over the years but that hasn't stopped me.'

After saying that he has not spoken to the FIA directly, he added: 'I usually follow my heart and do what is right and I felt that was me following my heart.

'I did something that has never really happened in Formula One before, and obviously they will stop it from happening again. People say sport is not a place for politics, but it is about human rights issues, and in my mind that is something we should be pushing towards.'

Accusing the FIA of making rules to ensure Mercedes lose

After the FIA made rule changes during the current 2020 season to qualifying rounds, Hamilton made his thoughts known.

The sport's authorities made the decision to ban certain engine modes during the qualifying rounds that had been in place since 2014. The 'party mode' would make extra engine revs available, thereby allowing for maximum deployment of energy during a qualifying lap.

Whilst the Brit said that he was not surprised that the FIA made the decision he did accuse the motive behind it being in order to slow Mercedes down. 

He unleashed an attack on the body, claiming that the rule change will not have the desired effect on the Mercedes team and that they will continue to win races. His team-mate Valtteri Bottas took a calmer approach towards the subject, as the Finnish driver said the team aren't panicking and that the rules are the same for everyone.

In Hamilton's defence, rule changes midway through a season are never met with great big smiles from the drivers on the grid, especially the ones who are running away with the championship under the current guidelines.

Demanding the FIA find a different interviewer 

Hamilton has always been an outspoken figure; one to never mince his words. However, on one occasion he flat out refused to take an interview after discovering that plans were in place for it to be conducted by his former Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.

The pair had a rather turbulent relationship during their time at Mercedes together, quite clearly not getting along well despite being very close during their childhood karting days.

Battling it out for three consecutive championships took a toll on their friendship and saw the German retire from the sport five days after he won his maiden world championship.

Clearly by 2018, the two still hadn't patched things up as Rosberg began his broadcasting career with German network RTL and Sky Sports.

Rosberg was due to conduct the post-race interviews in Hockenheim, after doing so previously in his home town of Monte Carlo, only for the broadcasters to pull the plug before the Grand Prix weekend. 

And Bild claimed the broadcasters axed Rosberg because Hamilton went to the FIA claiming he did not want to be interviewed by his former team-mate and foe.

'Silenced' for supporting Colin Kaepernick

Hamilton said that he regretted not taking more of a stand in 2016 when he wanted to show support for NFL player Colin Kaepernick - who kneeled during the American anthem in an anti-racism protest.

The Mercedes driver praised Kaepernick for his gesture but revealed he was 'silenced' after he made plans to show his support.

'I thought that (taking a knee) was a very powerful statement,' said Hamilton. 

'Then he lost his job and he was a great athlete. I spoke to him a couple of years ago shortly after that for the US GP. I had a helmet made in red for his top with his number on but back then I was kind of silenced. 

'I was told to back down and "Don't support it," which I regret. So it is important for me that during this time I did my part.'

According to reports, Hamilton was warned by a high-ranking official of the potential consequences for wearing the helmet.

Claiming GPDA 'lack leadership' in the fight against racism

As Formula One began to catch up with the rest of sport in their support for the anti-racism campaigning during 2020, the idea to bring drivers together to take a knee before the race was frankly a mess for the first couple weeks.

An ensemble made from all the drivers on the grid performed a gesture of unity and they stood together, with some taking a knee and some remaining standing. 

However, in the first couple weeks, not all of the drivers made it to the group in time and the constant split between kneeling and standing has caused embarrassment for the F1 bosses.

After the Hungarian Grand Prix, Hamilton singled out the GPDA (Grand Prix Drivers' Association) director Romain Grosjean, who races for Haas, for failing to convince the grid to be united. 

'There is definitely not enough support for it,' said Hamilton. 'It is like it has gone off the agenda. It is lacking leadership.

Hamilton also took aim at GPDA director Romain Grosjean for not showing enough support

'From a drivers' point of view, many seem to be of the opinion they've done it once and they're not going to do it again.

'We are all members of the GPDA and the GPDA is run by three people - two who are really supportive, and one who tends to think it is not important to continue with.

The other two members of the association are Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who has been taking a knee, and chairman Alex Wurz, a former F1 driver. 

Aiming at Grosjean, Hamilton added: 'I don't think it's being taken seriously. There are perhaps people who have not grown up around racism so don't understand it and because of that it doesn't affect them.

'I have heard people say "it doesn't do anything for me so why should I do it?" But it's not about me and you, it's about this fight for the people out there who are experiencing discrimination.'
