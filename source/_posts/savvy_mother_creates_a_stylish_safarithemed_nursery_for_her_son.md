If you have a little one on the way, you might have started designing your nursery, only to be taken aback by the huge costs of baby accessories online.

But one mother-of-four created the nursery of her dreams using clever kitchen materials from Ikea and affordable accessories from Matalan and H&M Home.

Victoria Salisbury, 35, a guidance worker from Chester, transformed her son's bedroom from a dull, plain space into an amazing Scandi-inspired nursery. 

Overall, Victoria spent just under £270 on kitting out the nursery, and told money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk: 'I took a lot of inspiration from Instagram.'

Simple but stylish touches such as open wooden shelving made from £7 IKEA spice racks and a giant £24.99 giraffe toy from H&M were affordable ways of adding interest to the nursery. 

She also spent just £5 on an IKEA clothes rail rather than a more expensive wardrobe - and a crocodile cot bumper was only £20 off of Amazon. Finally, hooks from IKEA cost just £3 each.  

Victoria also took her time to build the nursery, keeping her eyes peeled for sales, asking family members for help with joinery to save on labour costs and sourcing deals online from small companies to save money.

The doting mother said: 'I love the Scandi style that is so popular at the moment so when we found out we were having a boy back in October 2019, I started planning his nursery.

'We weren't in any rush, as it's recommended babies stay in your room for months after they are born anyway, which is how we were able to finish the room to such a high standard by buying bits here and there rather than in one go.

Victoria (pictured) said the room is now 'so comfy'. Simple but stylish touches such as open wooden shelving made from £7 IKEA spice racks and a giant £24.99 giraffe toy from H&M were affordable ways of adding interest to the nursery

She added: 'We decided on a safari theme as it can be done really well with Scandi style using natural woods and plants.

'I created a couple of mood boards with screenshots of items and designs I liked and would shop around and try and buy things when they were on sale.

'We got his cot bed from John Lewis when they had a 20 per cent off sale for example and then used an online company who make made to measure mattresses which cost half the price of the branded ones so we saved quite a lot of money.

'I like to buy quality key pieces that will last through the years and accessorise with high street items that can be easily switched.

'There are so many small businesses on Etsy and Instagram that sell beautiful, individual accessories as well. I think it's important to try and support them especially at times like this. 

'The room will still be age-appropriate for a few years which is a bonus.'

Victoria also revealed that she was fortunate to have family and friends who could offer their skills. 

'We are really lucky as my dad is a joiner so he replaced the skirting boards, architrave, windowsill and laid the laminate flooring for us,' she said.

'We have a friend who plastered the room for us for a really good rate. We decorated it ourselves after watching a YouTube tutorial on how to get the perfect straight line. It's so easy and means you don't have to do much cutting in.

'The room is so small so we needed to make the most of the space. I googled space-saving storage ideas and got loads of brilliant IKEA hacks that were so cheap. The shelves, hooks and clothes rack are IKEA and cost roughly £40 total.'

Victoria is delighted with how the nursery turned out and urges others who want to create a similar nursery not to rush and to take their time to find great bargains. 

'My main tips would be to take your time, shop around to get the best deals, use mood boards to make sure everything coordinates and use Pinterest and Instagram for inspiration,' Victoria added.

'I think we've done a really good job of utilising the space. His little reading corner is my favourite area. It's so comfy with a little throw, snuggled up reading to him with his lamp on!' 

Tom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals.co.uk, commented: 'Having a baby is an expensive project, and creating a lovely nursery can be a huge expense!

'However, as Victoria proves, you don't need to splurge to make the nursery look like it's stepped straight off a stylish Scandi Instagram account - IKEA spice racks, Matalan artificial plants and H&M Home toys are super cute additions and don't cost the earth!'
