 BRITISH volunteers could be the first in the world to be deliberately infected with coronavirus for vaccine trials.

The tests are set to begin in January and will be hosted in London, it was reported last night.

Deliberately infecting subjects – known as ‘challenge’ trials – is ethically controversial when it involves diseases such as coronavirus which can be very harmful.

However, the hope is that volunteers will be young enough to avoid the extreme health issues which mostly affect older age groups with Covid-19.

A US-based campaign group which lobbies for challenge trials, 1DaySooner, says it is hoping for funding from the UK Government for the scheme.

2,000 people from the UK have already volunteered to be deliberately infected with coronavirus as part of a search for a Covid-19 vaccine

The group already has around 2,000 UK volunteers signed up.

Last night the Government confirmed the controversial trial will take place.  

 A Government spokesman said: ‘We are working with partners to understand how we might collaborate on the potential development of a COVID-19 vaccine through human challenge studies.

‘These discussions are part of our work to research ways of treating, limiting, and hopefully preventing the virus so we can end the pandemic sooner.’

The group already has around 2,000 volunteers signed up in the UK.

1DaySooner, working with researchers, is understood to have found a secure quarantine facility in east London where people can be vaccinated and then infected with the virus a month or so later under controlled conditions.

Current coronavirus vaccine trials involve many thousands of volunteers in the general community.

But with only a small percentage of the whole population infected at any one time, gathering data on the effectiveness of a vaccination is a slow process which could be greatly speeded up by the challenge trial.

Isaac Martinez, project manager at 1Day Sooner, said: ‘This does not have regulatory approval yet, as far as I know, but we are confident it will be approved in the UK soon.

‘There are multiple parties involved in this, and we have been in talks with a few members of the UK Government.’

Challenge trials date back to 1796, when Edward Jenner inoculated eight-year-old James Phipps with live cowpox virus.

More recently, they have been used to develop vaccines and treatments for typhoid, cholera and malaria.
