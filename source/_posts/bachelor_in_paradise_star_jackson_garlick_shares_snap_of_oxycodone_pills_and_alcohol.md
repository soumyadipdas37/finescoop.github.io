Bachelor in Paradise star Jackson Garlick has appeared to boast about mixing Oxycodone with alcohol in a now-deleted post shared to his Instagram Stories.

In the picture, the 26-year-old positioned a packet of Endone branded pills in front of a glass of red wine and irresponsibly added the caption: 'Name a better duo'.

The pharmaceutical medication, which is commonly referred to the brand name OxyContin, is used to treat patients with severe pain and can cause dangerous, and sometimes fatal, side effects when mixed with alcohol.

It is unclear whether rugby player Jackson ingested the two substances together, or if he has been solely taking the Endone pills due to an injury.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Jackson for further comment.

Endone contains the active ingredient oxycodone hydrochloride, which can prove highly dangerous if mixed with alcohol.

The combination of both substances can slow down and even stop the breathing and cardiac function if they are ingested jointly in large enough quantities.

Irreversible brain and significant organ damage are also outcomes of the toxic potion.

Each year, thousands lose their lives as a result of getting addicted to the oxycodone and alcohol mixture.

TV star: Jackson first began his career in reality television after starring on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette last year
