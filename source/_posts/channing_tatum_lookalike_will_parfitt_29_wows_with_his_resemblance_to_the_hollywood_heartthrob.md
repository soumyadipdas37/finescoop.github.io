A male stripper has gained millions of followers on social media through his uncanny resemblance to Hollywood heartthrob Channing Tatum.

It's a cookie-cutter example of life imitating art for Will Parfitt, a London-born performer living in Melbourne since 2015 whose career has mirrored the film Magic Mike in more ways than his physical similarity to its now 40-year-old star.

After moving Down Under, the 29-year-old removalist was scouted by a club promoter and began working for Magic Men, an agency specialising in bachelorette parties and private events - just like Tatum's handyman character in the 2012 drama.

Stripping as 'Channing' in an ode to his famous doppelganger, Mr Parfitt has grown an audience of 252,000 Instagram followers and a whopping 2.4million on TikTok - where fans say they find him even more attractive than his handsome namesake.

'Okay, I have decided I actually prefer you to Channing Tatum,' a follower called Lisa wrote under a recent video.

'Better looking than you know who!' another agreed, while a third said: 'Legit (sic) thought this was Channing for the first 10 seconds.'

'So much better than the famous one everyone compares you to, who I won't name,' a fourth added.

Other responses include 'you are definitely more attractive than Channing Tatum', 'you could be his twin' and 'you are the best looking man I've ever seen'.

Under a recent TikTok video of Mr Parfitt dressed as a policeman and twirling a set of handcuffs in one hand, a woman wrote: 'Arrest me.'

A recent video of Mr Parfitt dressed as a policeman and twirling a set of handcuffs in one hand elicited particularly strong reactions.

The clip, which is captioned 'going through a break up so your friends get you something to cheer you up', drew thousands of comments with one woman writing: 'I'm 46 and happily married but can we pretend I'm [going through] a break up?'

Another simply told Mr Parfitt to arrest her.

Many wondered why the performer - who is described as a 'spunky, drop-dead gorgeous boy next door' in his profile on Magic Men's website - hasn't gone 'major viral' online yet.

During peak wedding season, which runs from October to April in Australia, Mr Parfitt once performed up to 15 times each weekend – but that was before the COVID crisis shuttered venues, suspending shows and forcing stars online.

Closures have cost him almost $3,000 a week, the sum he would typically earn for just one weekend's work.

But his ever-increasing social media profile is sure to provide him with a host of new opportunities as soon as Victoria's second lockdown is lifted.
