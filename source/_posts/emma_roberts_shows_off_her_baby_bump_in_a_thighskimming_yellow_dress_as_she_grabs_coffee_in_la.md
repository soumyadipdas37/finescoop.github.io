Emma Roberts looked radiant as she flaunted her chic maternity style one month after confirming she is expecting her first child with boyfriend Garrett Hedlund. 

As she enjoyed a beverage at Blue Bottle Coffee in Los Angeles on Tuesday, the 29-year-old actress showcased her growing bump in a thigh-skimming yellow dress. 

The Scream Queens star expertly paired her loose-fitting babydoll dress with a matching mustard-hued face mask and her signature aviator shades.

She accessorized her subdued ensemble with a pair of black leather loafers, which were adorned with an intricate flower design, and a large designer handbag. 

Her beautiful bright blonde tresses appeared to be recently cut, as she strutted around with fresh layers and highlights in hair. 

The mom-to-be's leggy display comes after officially confirming her pregnancy with her 36-year-old beau, Garrett Hedlund, on Instagram at the very end of August.

In her slideshow, she put on a loved-up display with Hedlund, who sat closely by her side and beamed. 

'Me... and my two favorite guys,' Roberts gushed, sharing two blue heart emojis, indicating her little one is a boy. 

The lovebirds were first romantically linked in the spring of 2019 following the breakup of Robert's long-time on/off relationship with her AHS co-star and former fiancé Evan Peters.

Hedlund had previously been in a relationship with Kirsten Dunst from 2012 to 2016.

Roberts and Hedlund are expecting a baby boy, but have not announced when they expect to welcome their bundle of joy.

Initially, Us Weekly reported that the couple were 'surprised, shocked and happy' to learn that they were going to be parents.

She is the niece of Hollywood A-lister Julia Roberts and has established a successful acting career of her own, which has included Scream 4, We're The Millers, Billionaire Boys club and American Horror Story. 

Earlier this week, she dropped a trailer for her new Netflix movie, Holidate.

She stars in the romantic comedy with Luke Bracey, as acquaintances who hatch a plan to be each other's plus ones for every holiday.

Roberts alerted her fans to the trailer and the October 28 release date on Instagram.

'Get ready you guys!! You’re gonna love this one #Holidate,' she wrote.

'You’ve never heard of a Holidate? It’s the perfect plus-one! That non-romantic friend who escorts you to an otherwise awkward holiday event when you don’t have a significant other. Watch us all try to try to find romance this Holiday season in the hilarious HOLIDATE on October 28th only on Netflix.'
