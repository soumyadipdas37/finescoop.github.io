Model and WAG Jesinta Campbell almost had a Marilyn Monroe moment as she stepped out in Sydney's Bondi on Wednesday. 

The 29-year-old stunned in a billowing white $525 dress by the label, AJE, but struggled to stop the frock from getting caught in the wind. 

The new mother, who welcomed daughter Tullulah in February, was seen leaving Hotel Ravesis in the trendy beachside hub.  

Be careful! On Wednesday, Jesinta Franklin stunned in a billowing $525 dress and almost had a Marilyn Monroe moment while out in Sydney's Bondi

Her dress featured puffy sleeves, a high neck, finished at the calf and had a belt, to cinch in the waist. 

Jesinta completed the look by wearing black lace up heels, black sunglasses and pearl-look drop earrings. 

She wore natural-looking makeup and her short hair out and neatly straightened.

Jesinta also toted a beige Celine bag and carried a juice bottle.

On Wednesday, Jesinta did an interview on The Morning Show. 

She revealed that she's hired a housekeeper to help her as she looks after her daughter, while husband Lance 'Buddy' Franklin stays in the AFL's quarantine hub in Queensland. 

Jesinta admitted that it was 'a juggle' without Buddy around, but she was being supported by her family.

'For the first five weeks, I went to the Gold Coast before the borders closed to be with mum and dad,' she said.

'I could not see how I could juggle work and Tullulah and everything that comes with everyday life without Buddy there to help out.'

The former Miss Universe Australia has since returned to Sydney, and admitted that she and Tullulah were 'really missing Buddy'.

Juggling act: 'I certainly cannot do it all - and I think the expectation or that thought that we can just puts so much pressure on us as women,' Jesinta said

But the mother of one has been getting some help since returning home.

'I proudly say that my little girl is home with my sister now, and I had a housekeeper come in on Monday to help me with the washing, and I'm having my dinners delivered,' she said.
