Elle Macpherson has come under fire by health experts for promoting a 'toxic' and 'fatal' substance, colloidal silver, that can permanently turn the skin blue. 

As reported by The Sunday Telegraph, the Australian supermodel, 56, promoted a recipe to 'take one drop of coated silver in water each day' on Instagram on Friday.

Professor of medicine John Dwyer told the publication this week: 'It's ineffective and dangerous, and anyone who uses it is foolish and has been poorly advised.'

Colloidal silver is a liquid containing tiny silver particles, that is often used to treat burns, skin wounds and infections.

At the time of publication, there are no FDA-approved prescription or over-the-counter drugs containing colloidal silver, available to buy in the United States.

It is also not possible to purchase colloidal silver over-the-counter in Australia, however it is used for medical purposes.

On her Instagram Stories on Friday, Macpherson encouraged her followers to 'take one drop of coated silver with water each day'.

The entrepreneur, nicknamed 'The Body' by Time Magazine in 1989, went on to describe silver as 'one of the noble and sacred metals'.

One side effect however of colloidal silver, is that it can result in argyria - a condition where the skin permanently turns a grey or blue shade.

Professor Dwyer told The Sunday Telegraph that colloidal silver 'can be toxic' and to not rely on celebrity health recommendations.

'All this nonsense is going on and far too many people think they are getting the good oil from celebrities and that has influence,' he said.   

Biochemist Dr Darren Saunders also supported Dwyer's comments in The Sunday Telegraph article.  

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Macpherson for comment.
