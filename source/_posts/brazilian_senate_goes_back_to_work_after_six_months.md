Government officials in Brazil have blamed a party hosted by lower house speaker Rodrigo Maia on September 9 as the source of a COVID-19 outbreak that sicked eight officials, including Maia, who attended the September 10 swearing-in ceremony of Court Chief Justice Luiz Fux

Brazil's Senate resumed in-person hearings Monday for the first time in six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, just 12 days after the House Speaker threw a party where he and seven other politicians caught Covid 19.   

House Speaker Rodrigo Maia hosted a party at his residence in Brasilia on September 9 as a farewell bash for the departing Supreme Court Chief Justice Dias Tofolli, ahead of the September 10 swearing-in ceremony of Supreme Court Chief Justice Luiz Fux.

Officials and other guests mingled without wearing face masks and ignored social distancing measures, according to local media outlets.

The event led to a COVID-19 outbreak with at least eight, including Maia and Fux infected.

Supreme Court ministers Benedito Gonçalvez, Justice Luis Felipe Salomão, Antonio Saldanha, Superior Labor Court minister Maria Cristina Peduzzi, Attorney General Augusto Aras and Tourism Minister Marcelo Álvaro Antônio also contracted the coronavirus.

A COVID-19 outbreak infected eight government officials in Brazil since September 10, including Tourism Minister Marcelo Álvaro Antônio and Supreme Court minister Luis Felipe Salomão

Supreme Court minister Antonio Saldanha is one of the eight government officials in Brazil who have been infected with COVID-19

Supreme Court minister Benedito Gonçalvez was among 48 people who attended the swearing-in event but the only infected official who skipped out on the dinner party

Gonçalvez, who was among 48 people who attended the Supreme Court's swearing-in event on September 10, was the only infected official who skipped out on the dinner party, according Supreme Court's press office. 

Brazilian news outlet Folha UOL reported that as many as 30 people attended an event in Fux's office. 

At least 157 Supreme Court employees contracted the coronavirus. The viral bug infected 13 of 27 state governors and eight members of President Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet. 

Government officials pointed to the event organized by Maia as the source of the outbreak, indicating that the Supreme Court exercised additional precautions with social distancing measures. Only 48 guests were allowed inside the court chamber which has a maximum occupancy of 250 people.

'To say that all these people got coronavirus because they spent two hours inside the [Supreme Court] plenary, with social distance, is very irresponsible,' a Supreme Court magistrate told Brazilian magazine Veja. 'You have to see what the guests have done before.'

The Senate, which had not hosted in-person sessions since April and held hearings and votes virtually, has not reported any positive cases since reopening.

Bolsonaro, who tested positive of the virus in July and once compared the virus to just 'a little flu,' said last Friday that stay-at-home measures were useless while meeting with agriculture businessmen in Mato Grosso.

'You did not get into this nonsense of ''stay home, we’ll take care of the economy later,''' he said. 'That’s for the weak.'

  Brazil ranks third in the globe behind the United States and India with 4,558,040 confirmed cases. The South American nation is second to the U.S. with 137,272 deaths.
