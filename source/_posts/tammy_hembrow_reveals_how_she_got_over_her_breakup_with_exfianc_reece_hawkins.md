Her ex-fiancé Reece Hawkins has just announced that he's expecting a baby with his model partner, London Goheen. 

And now Tammy Hembrow has revealed how she got over their breakup, after they split back in 2018.

Speaking on her podcast, Hanging With The Hembrows, the 26-year-old said that she focused on herself and their children while nursing a broken heart. 

'It just takes time': Tammy Hembrow revealed on her podcast this week how she got over her breakup with ex-fiancé Reece Hawkins 

'Reece was younger than me, he was in the grade below me at school,' Tammy began, as she reflected on their relationship.

She went on to say that 'age is just a number,' before being quizzed by her sisters Amy, Emilee and Starlette about how she got through their split. 

'Just like trying to have a positive mindset, keeping busy and doing things you enjoy doing,' Tammy said.

She added: 'Focusing on yourself, work and kids, that's all the stuff that helped me.'

Tammy also said during the podcast, which was giving Starlette tips on how to get through life in your twenties, that getting over a breakup 'takes time.'

'It just takes time. Time heals all wounds, you can't expect it to be over in a day,' Tammy said. 

She added: 'Take it day by day and focus on the present moment.'

Tammy and Reece split in 2018 after five years of dating. 

Moving on: 'It just takes time. Time heals all wounds, you can't expect it to be over in a day,' Tammy said

They share son Wolf, five, and daughter Saskia, four, together. 

Last Wednesday, Reece and new fiancée London Goheen announced that they are expecting their first child together. 

The announcement came just weeks after they got engaged.

American model London, 22, made the announcement on Instagram, by sharing a sweet image of herself kissing influencer Reece, 25.

'Baby Momma alert. Having a baby with the love of my life and my best friend,' he wrote.

She was recently slammed for charging fans $14.99 to see baby bump pics on OnlyFans. 

The couple have been dating since mid-2018, getting together shortly after his split with Tammy.
