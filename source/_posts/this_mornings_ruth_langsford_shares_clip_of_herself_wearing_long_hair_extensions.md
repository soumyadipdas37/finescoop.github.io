She's known for looking stylish and polished whenever making appearances on such TV shows as This Morning and Loose Women.

But Ruth Langsford shared footage of herself looking completely different during a trip to the salon on Thursday, when she was seen sporting long hair extensions.

The 60-year-old TV personality showed herself sporting the long added tresses as she explained that they were added for volume rather than length.

She wrote: 'My hair extension tapes came out during lockdown and I hadn't bothered replacing them....but I missed the extra body they give my hair.

'I don’t have them for extra length, just to add a bit of volume at the sides. My hair definitely got thinner because of menopause so these really help.'

In a follow-up video, she was seen getting her hair prepared for colouring as she told fans she was 'getting the full works' done to her tresses.

Putting safety first, the TV personality was seen donning a face mask as she sat through the lengthy procedure.

When hair salons were finally reopened in July amid the COVID-19 lockdown, Ruth was seen taking a trip to her local hairdresser in Weybridge, Surrey. 

She beamed as she walked out of the Leo Bancroft salon in the town where she lives with her husband and This Morning co-host, Eamonn Holmes, 60. 

She also posted a video of her in the chair at the empty hairdresser and told her fans: 'Yes I'm finally here. Look I'm the only one here at the moment. Getting these roots done finally.'

Ruth then scraped back her hair to show her followers her roots and said: 'Look how dark they are getting!'

Later that day, she took to Twitter to show off her new colouring with pride. She wrote: 'DONE!! SO happy to have my blonde back!'

Her beautification outing came as fans claimed she hadn't changed a bit after she shared a throwback snap from 19 years ago on her Instagram page.

Ruth shared a sweet image with her pal Sam Balshaw wearing a chic pink trouser suit while posing at her friend's son's christening.

'So happy': Late that day she took to Twitter to show off her new colouring with pride. She wrote, 'DONE!! SO happy to have my blonde back!'

The star revealed that the image was taken just a day before she found out she was pregnant with her son Jack, 18, who she shares with husband Eamonn. 

She wrote alongside the snap: 'Sorting through some old photos and found this ....19 yrs ago at my Godson Charlie’s christening. 

'The day before I had just found out I was pregnant with Jack! @eamonnholmes was away with the children so my best friend here @balshaw.sam was the first to know....

'A very special moment together. We’ve shared a lot of those during our 30 yr friendship....thanks mate. She’s fairly new to all this so it would be lovely if you give her a follow and say hello.'
