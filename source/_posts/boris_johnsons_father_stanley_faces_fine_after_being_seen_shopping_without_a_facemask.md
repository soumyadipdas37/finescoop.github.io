Boris Johnson's father faces a £200 fine after he was spotted breaching coronavirus rules and shopping without a facemask.

Stanley Johnson, 79, who just months ago flew to his Greek villa in brazen defiance of pandemic travel warnings, was spotted without a face covering as he bought a newspaper at a newsagents in West London on Tuesday.

The scenes come after the Prime Minister today pleaded with the British public to  'follow the guidance' and urged people to wear a mask in shops and on public transport during a Downing Street press conference. 

After being caught red-handed without a mask, the Prime Minister's father admitted he was 'maybe not 100 per cent up to speed' with the rules having just returned from abroad and said he was 'extremely sorry'.

He told The Mirror: 'I was maybe not 100 per cent up to speed but that was my first day back in England after three weeks not in England.

'So they (the rules) may have changed in that time. I'm not really a big shopping man.

'I'm extremely sorry for the slip up and I would urge absolutely everybody to do everything they can to make sure they do follow the rules about masks and social distancing.'  

The scenes come just months after the Prime Minister was met with a furious backlash after his father jetted to his four-bed home in Greece– ignoring Foreign Office guidance which said no one should travel unless it is essential.

Despite the Government advising against all but essential travel, Mr Johnson claimed he needed to 'Covid proof' his villa before the pandemic-blighted tourist season started. 

The retired Tory MEP told local and international press: 'There is no question of my breaking the law. The minister of tourism here has my papers.

'It was always absolutely clear from the Greek government that the only thing they were banning were people coming in from direct flights from Britain.'

Locals claimed he arrived to the region by private car after documenting his controversial journey from the UK on social media, sharing a video taken from a plane and a selfie where his face was covered with a white mask. 

When he was later confronted by international media in Pelion, a visibly unnerved Mr Johnson said he was unaware of the outcry in Britain about his flight. 

'It is true I took the pictures down,' he said. 'But I didn't put them up in spirit of defiance…. I certainly had no intention of provoking anyone.' 

Today Boris Johnson pleaded with Britons to 'follow the guidance' in an effort to prevent a second national lockdown.

He said: 'Let me just say what I've said to everybody, please everybody follow the guidance.

'Bearing in mind, you are doing it not just to protect your neighbour but ultimately someone that you could transmit the disease to that could end up infecting someone that you love. It is absolutely crucial that we stop the spread of this disease.'

He added: 'Wear a mask on transport in the way that is recommended.

'And, bear in mind that the fines are now very considerable and they will be imposed.'

Last week, the Prime Minister revealed that fines for failing to wear a face mask will rise to £200 and will become compulsory for bar staff, shop workers, waiters and taxi passengers.
