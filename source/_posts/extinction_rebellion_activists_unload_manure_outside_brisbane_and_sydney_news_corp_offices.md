Extinction Rebellion activists dumped manure outside a number of News Corp offices to protest against the media giant's coverage of climate change.  

The demonstrators staged the dirty rally outside of the Sydney and Brisbane sites on Friday.  

Angry demonstrators flanked the mounds of manure and waved placards urging the newspaper to 'tell the truth'.

Activist Kelly filmed the demonstration outside of the Surry Hills office, in Sydney. 

'Literal bulls***' outside of the News Corp offices,' she said. 

'We're here to help tell Murdoch to stop spreading the climate lies.

'Stop the climate lies and tell the truth about the climate emergency.' 

Extinction Rebellion claims News Corp is fuelling a culture of climate denialism in Australia.

Police officers watch over activists as Extinction Rebellion staged the dirty rally in Sydney on Friday

A number of protesters scaled the front of the Sydney building to wave a banner that read: 'tell the truth'.

Another demonstrator was filmed spray painting a climate message onto the footpath while their counterparts waved placards. 

Demonstrators also disrupted work at the Murrarie printing and distribution centre in Brisbane overnight.

They chained themselves to gates and glued themselves to the top of a newspaper delivery truck. 

Police were called to disperse the rally just after 11pm and arrested nine people, issuing seven with fines for trespassing and public nuisance offences. 

Two people were charged with obstructing police and trespass with one of the offenders allegedly super glueing his hands to the top of the vehicle.

The pair will appear in court at a later date.

In a statement, Extinction Rebellion accused police of rough treatment towards one of the protesters during his arrest, kneeling on his neck and using brake fluid rather than acetone to remove glue from his hands.

Extinction Rebellion is calling for a binding target of zero net-emissions before 2025, overseen by a citizens' assembly. 

'The professional media have a duty to tell the truth and the truth is that we are in a climate and ecological crisis that threatens the survival of humans as a species,' a spokesman for the group said.

Activists have warned a planned mass-cycling protest will block Brisbane CBD traffic on September 21 unless their demands are met.
