90 Day Fiance's Larissa Dos Santos Lima's arrest by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Saturday was not a publicity stunt and may result in her deportation.

The 33-year-old reality star has been 'placed in removal proceedings' in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act according to documents obtained by TMZ on Tuesday morning.

She is also set for a hearing to determine whether or not she will have to surrender for removal from the US according to the site.

The arrest reportedly occurred as the 33-year-old reality star and her boyfriend, Eric Nichols were leaving their Las Vegas home, which they recently sold. 

The couple were reportedly to embark on their 'new beginning' in Colorado Springs, before 'ICE agents showed up to their doorstep,' according to TMZ. 

Several fans of the show believed it all could have been a publicity stunt but the recent reports have seemingly proved otherwise.

On Saturday, her best friend, Carmen Nys, revealed that Lima and Nichols were 'about to leave their house and move to Colorado' ahead of the arrest.   

'We have no clue why. I want to let her family, fans and friends know that we are going there right now and as soon, as I have more info I will keep you guys posted. Send prayers,' Nys wrote on her Instagram Story. 

After her release, Lima updated her 589,000 followers that she was 'out' and the officers were 'very nice' and she was 'good to go.'

'Thank you everyone for all the prayers,' she captioned her recording, which showed her with a surgical mask under her chin and looking in high spirits. 

As she filmed, her boyfriend professed his love for her and looked relieved to be reunited. 

'I love you too,' she responded, as he filmed them in a U-Haul trip en route to Colorado.

Lima, whose disastrous seven-month marriage to Colt Johnson was documented on the hit TLC reality show, was arrested twice in 2018 for domestic battery. 

Ultimately, the charges were dismissed after her first arrest and she was never charged for the second. 

On the same day her ex-husband filed for divorce from her in January 2019, she was arrested and charged with first-degree domestic battery during an alleged altercation with him.

In May 2019, her lawyer revealed to Us Weekly her charges 'were set to be reduced down to disorderly conduct upon successful completion of her requirements.' 

Earlier this week, Lima unveiled her new body after undergoing a dramatic plastic surgery makeover.

In an effort to look like Kylie Jenner, she underwent $72,000 worth cosmetic surgeries earlier this year, including breast implants, fat transfer to her butt, liposuction for her waist, hips and abs area, a nose job, fillers, Botox and laser facials.

She has two children from previous relationships, a son named Arry with ex boyfriend Marcos Hack; their son lives with his sister - Arry's aunt, whom also adopted him.

She has a daughter from another relationship, who is also lives in her native country of Brazil.
