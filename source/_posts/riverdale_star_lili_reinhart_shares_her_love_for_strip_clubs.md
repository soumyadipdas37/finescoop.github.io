Lili Reinhart has candidly opened up about her passion for visiting strip clubs, months after coming out as bisexual back in June.

The 24-year-old, who split with her ex-boyfriend Cole Sprouse back in January, said the strip clubs are 'like Disneyland' to her, in a candid interview with Stellar this week.

'I just came out as bisexual recently, so it's not really a surprise to anyone,' she said.

The starlet said that starring in Hustlers made her 'appreciate' strip clubs even more, after she played dancer Annabelle alongside megastar Jennifer Lopez.

'My close friends and my castmates, maybe they didn't know that I was bisexual, they were probably like, 'Why does this girl like strip clubs so much?' And I'm like, 'Well, now you know!''

The Riverdale star admitted to the Los Angeles Times in August that she decided to come out so that she can publicly date whoever she wants without people asking questions.

She said: 'I thought: 'Do I like girls? I don't know.' As I've gotten older, the answer has become 'Yes. Clearly, I do.'

'I think I just felt at this point in time: Why not? If suddenly I started dating a girl publicly, I didn't want people to be, like, 'What the…?''

'Not that I would even owe anyone an explanation. Because I don't.'

Lili came out in a post on her Instagram Story, in which she showed her support for a protest taking place in West Hollywood for members of the LGBTQ community who are in support of Black Lives Matter.

Promoting the event, she wrote: 'Although I've never announced it publicly before, I am a proud bisexual woman. And I will be joining this protest today.'
