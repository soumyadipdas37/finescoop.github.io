A woman has revealed how her stalker ex boyfriend left her scarred for life, after attacking her and her best friend in a horrific assault.

Megan Fenwick, 26, was a sleepover with best friend Amy Smith, 26,  at her home in London, when her ex- boyfriend Mitchell Bains broke into her flat and attacked the pair.

She has been left with a scar on her face, after thug, Bains, 23, sunk his teeth into her cheek.   

In May, he was jailed for 20 months.

Now, Megan shares the details of their relationship in a bid to raise awareness for stalking.

Megan says Bains  dragged her by her hair to the door and repeatedly slammed it into her arm

She said: 'The night he attacked me was the worst of my life.

'If Amy hadn't have been there, I believe he would've killed me.

'I'm just glad I survived.'  

Megan and Bains met in August 2017 when she started a job in a car sales garage where he worked.

The pair hit it off and two months later they were a couple - almost a year later, in March 2018 the pair moved in together.

 Megan added: 'At first, he was sweet.

'He made me laugh and everyone got on with him.

'But one night, on New Year's Eve, while we were at a party, some men hit on me and Mitchell nearly started a fight with them.

'When we got home, he punched the fridge.

'His jealousy was out of control.'

The following month, the couple attended a family member's wedding, when Bains got drunk and eventually confessed he had cheated on Megan. 

The pair met in August 2017, when Megan got a job at the car sales garage he was working

 She says: 'He blurted out that he'd cheated and then stormed out of the hotel room into the road.

'I was upset but wanted to talk things through.

'I followed him outside and he yelled at me and shoved me in the chest.

'At that moment, a police car pulled up and he spent the night in a cell.'

After that, Bains begged for Megan's forgiveness and she eventually forgave him.

Bains regularly got drunk and and started arguments, accusing Megan of being unfaithful.

Gradually he became more aggressive too.

Megan says: 'One day he came home with two pairs of boxing gloves.

'Thinking it'd be fun, we put them on and I jabbed at him playfully.

'But then he whacked my arm hard and it bruised.

'After that I hid the gloves under my bed.'

A few weeks later, Bains ordered a Taser gun online.

Megan says: 'When it arrived, he pointed it and threatened to shoot me with it.

'I was terrified.' 

In October 2019, Megan decided she reached her limits and plucked up the courage to break up with him.

Surprisingly, he took the news well and moved out.

But, just days later, he began to stalk her.

For six months, he bombarded Megan with over 300 texts a week, even sending her flowers every day, begging her to take him back.

 Megan added: 'He even turned up at my workplace and followed me in his car.

'I'd see him sitting in his car outside my flat, watching me-it was so creepy.

'I was forced to change my locks.'

Bains continued to stalk Megan, so she went to stay with her parents for two weeks.

But when she returned to her flat, she noticed Bain's van parked outside.

She says: 'I hurried inside my flat and reported him to the police who agreed to investigate.

'The next few days he posted love notes through my door and left flowers on my doorstep.

'He even threatened to kill us both if I didn't get back with him.'

Then, in March 2020, Megan's and her best friend, Amy, an events coordinator, were at her flat for a sleepover.

That night, the pair were jolted awake by Bains, who had broken into the flat.

Megan says: 'I woke up to find Mitchell stood over me.

'He dragged me by my hair to the door and repeatedly slammed it into my arm.

'Amy screamed for him to let me go, but he continued to hurt me.' 

 'He pushed me to the floor and started punching me in the face.

'Then he started to strangle me-I thought I was going to die.

'Moments later, he sunk his teeth into my cheek, ripping the skin.

'The pain was excruciating.'

Amy attempted to pull Bains off Megan, but he punched her away.

IT was then Bains pulled out a knife and started waving it at the pair.

Thankfully, neighbours heard the commotion and called the police who arrived shortly after and arrested Bains.

Paramedics arrived and treated Megan for a deep cut to her cheek, while Amy suffered bruised ribs and a torn ligament.

After leaving Megan scarred, Bains was jailed for 20 months in May at Derby Crown Court

In April 2020, Bains, of Alvaston, Derby, pleaded guilty to stalking, ABH, assault by beating, assault on an emergency worker and criminal damage.

He was jailed for 20 months, and given a ten year restraining order against Megan at Derby Crown Court.

Megan says: 'His sentence is a joke.

'He's already been released from prison after serving only a few months.

'I'm so angry, it was barely punishment for the horrific pain he inflicted on me and Amy.

'I've been left with a permanent scar under my left eye which is a constant reminder of that night.

'I just hope I never see his face again.'
