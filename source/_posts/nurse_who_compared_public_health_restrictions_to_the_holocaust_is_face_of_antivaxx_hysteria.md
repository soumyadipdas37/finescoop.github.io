A suspended nurse who has compared public health restrictions to the Holocaust has become the new face of the anti-vaccination movement in Britain.

Kate Shemirani, who is due to host a rally in Trafalgar Square next Saturday, has promoted bogus claims on social media that vaccines are poisonous.

On Twitter earlier this week, she asked her followers whether the public would wake up 'on the cattle truck? Or in the showers?'

She also claimed to have first-hand accounts of patients being taken to hospital during the coronavirus pandemic who were deliberately allowed to die.

Miss Shemirani, with Piers Corbyn at the anti-vaxx protest in Trafalgar Square two week ago. She also claimed to have first-hand accounts of patients being taken to hospital during the coronavirus pandemic who were deliberately allowed to die

She wrote: 'Murder. Genocide. The NHS is the new Auschwitz.' Miss Shemirani, 54, has been suspended for 18 months to avoid the risk of harm to the public, The Times reported.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council is investigating her statements linking coronavirus vaccines to 5G mobile phone technology.

She was represented at an interim hearing in July by Mark Steele, a campaigner against 5G phone masts.

At the hearing, both Miss Shemirani and Mr Steele attacked the panel for not wanting to hear their 'facts' about vaccines and 5G.

Thousands of people, including many conspiracy theorists, met at the Unite For Freedom rally and march from Trafalgar Square to Downing Street to protest against coronavirus measures last month

Mr Steele accused the nursing regulator of being complicit in genocide, it is claimed. 

Miss Shemirani said nurses who made accusations against her did so because they were overweight and jealous. She added: 'We all know what women can be like.'

She has reportedly resigned as a registered nurse.

Her Twitter following has trebled in the last three weeks to 21,000 followers. Her Facebook site, which had 14,000 followers, has been removed.

A Facebook spokesman said it had banned her 'for repeatedly violating our policies against harmful misinformation'.

Her Trafalgar Square rally is said to be a 'medic-focused event' with guests including academics who have questioned whether coronavirus is real.
