He's the former Bachelor star who has been keeping a low profile since his turn on the show.

And on Tuesday, Matt Agnew was unrecognisable as he stepped out wearing a face mask and matching tracksuits.

Uploading a photo to his Instagram account, the 33-year-old astrophysicist looked world's away from his reality TV debut as Channel 10's The Bachelor last year.

In the photo, Matt is seen resting his leg on a football while he was joined by two dogs.

He was seen wearing a black face mask, which covered the lower-half of his face, while a white beanie covered his forehead.

Alongside the post, Matt wrote: Some people are born cool, some achieve coolness, and some, just, sort of... don't.' 

That's more like it! Alongside the post, Matt wrote: Some people are born cool, some achieve coolness, and some, just, sort of... don't.' 

His followers, however, were quick to comment on his clothing.

'You are cool, you're just hiding it well,' one person wrote. 

Following his rise to fame last year, Matt has been kept a low-profile. Matt now has a PhD from Swinburne University of Technology and works as a data scientist.

Matt found love with Chelsie McLeod, 28, on last year's season of The Bachelor, but the couple announced their split just two months after the finale aired. 

'Chels and I have made some beautiful memories together that I'll always cherish, and I wish her nothing but the absolute best,' he wrote on Instagram at the time.

'However, it's with a heavy heart that I write this. For Chels and me, our relationship hasn't translated from filming to the real, every day world as we had hoped.'
