As the world's biggest stars prepare for Hollywood's first major pandemic-era awards show, many are using throwbacks to reminisce about staying out past midnight. 

Ahead of Sunday's all-virtual Emmys, supermodel Cindy Crawford shared an iconic snap of herself from the 44th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in 1992.  

'90210 meets MTV,' she captioned the iconic photo of herself, at age 26, sporting a black beret and silk-layered bustier, as she posed with actor Jason Priestley.

Demi Moore also took a trip down memory lane, opting to upload a picture of herself strolling arm-in-arm with her now-ex-husband, Bruce Willis.  

The former couple, who were months away from tying the knot ahead of the 1987 award show, looked happy and in love as they coordinated in all-black ensembles. 

'1987 #Emmys... arriving in style,' the Ghost star, 57, captioned the shot, which caught the attention of the her and Willis' 29-year-old daughter, Scout.

'Omg dad’s coat is sending me,' the Brown University graduate remarked of her father's nearly floor-length black jacket. 

Meanwhile, her mother's chic gown, bright red lipstick and minimal makeup remains a timeless classic, even 33 years later. 

In a more recent throwback, actress Jessica Biel shared a swoon-worthy picture of herself resting on her tuxedo-clad husband, Justin Timberlake, from 2018.

Additionally, on her Instagram Story, Biel shared another stunning shot of herself in the same strapless Ralph & Russo gown with cascading ruffles. 

Like the cheeky 7th Heaven star, Brooke Shields couldn't resist joking to her 1.1 million Instagram followers about the days of getting all dolled up.

Upon reading her comments, the 34-year-old vocal body positivity advocate took time to respond to a fan, who raved her skin was 'so perfect.'

The Good Place star pointed out her skin was 'currently clear' because 'privileged people have more access to good quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly less stressful than the lives of those with less privilege.'

'I also get to sleep more because of this. All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I’m able to address food intolerances easily,' she noted.

Jamil also said exfoliating 'twice a week' and believing 'trans rights are human' also helps her radiant complexion.
