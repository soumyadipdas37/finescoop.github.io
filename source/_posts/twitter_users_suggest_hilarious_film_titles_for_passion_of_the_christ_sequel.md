Actor Jim Caviezel confirmed this weekend that a sequel to the 2004 film The Passion of the Christ is in the works, with Mel Gibson finishing up his third draft of the script.

But while Caviezel shared that the sequel will be called The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection, Twitter users believe they have some better ideas for the title.

Dozens have taken to the social media platform to share their own suggestions, all of which skew comical rather than strictly biblical.

Among the popular recommendations are Passion of the Christ 2 : Nailed It, Passion of the Christ 2: I Still Know What You Did Last Easter, Passion of the Christ 2: Jesus, another one?!, and — in a nod to the Fast and the Furious franchise — 2 Christ 2 Passionate.

But according to Twitter trends, there is one clear front-runner, which multiple people are rooting for — The Passion of the Christ 2: Electric Boogaloo.
