A luxury haircare brand is hiring its first ever Chief Shower Officer and will pay that lucky 'executive' $5,000 just to wash their locks. 

Fekkai Haircare, the high-end brand founded by A-list hairstylist Frederic Fekkai, is looking for a beauty lover to join its team of C-suite executives in the 30-day position, which involves testing and reviewing new products, providing feedback, and documenting their thoughts on social media. 

'Throughout the 30-day position, the Chief Shower Officer will be responsible for providing a weekly “suds report” recapping their experience with the products, documenting their results on social media and providing feedback for future product development,' the brand said in a statement. 

'Dream job': Luxury haircare line Fekkai is hiring its first ever Chief Shower Officer (CSO) who will be paid to wash their hair and test out products 

The chosen applicant will receive $5,000 in compensation, as well as free haircare products. 

Speaking about the new position in a video posted on the brand's official YouTube account, Mr. Fekkai - who counts Cameron Diaz, Debra Messing and Anne Hataway among his clientele - said: 'To apply, visit our website and tell us a little bit about yourself.

'This may just be the most important position we have ever hired for. Welcome to the C-suite.' 

To apply for the beauty-based role, would-be CSOs, who have to be over the age of 21, need to put together a short Instagram video about themselves, explaining why they think they would be suited for the unique position. 

They are then being asked to post the video on their account using the hashtag #FekkaiCalm.

Other requirements for the role include: 'having a shower, hair, and at least 15 years of experience washing their own hair' and 'a presence on social media channels'.

Money maker: The chosen applicant will receive $5,000 for the 30-day position, which will require them to do weekly 'suds reports' on the brand's new CBD Scalp Calming collection

The ideal candidate should also possess a 'love of hair products' and an eagerness to 'try the newest ones on the market', as well as the ability to 'adjust shower knobs to find the perfect temperature'. 

'If you love hair products and are always looking to try the newest ones on the market, it’s time to turn that dream into a reality,' a brand spokesperson said. 

'Fekkai is searching for a new C-suite “executive” – a Chief Shower Officer – to test the brand’s new CBD Scalp Calming Collection from the comfort of their own home.'

The chosen applicant will hold the role from October 1 until October 31, and during that time they will be required to test out the brand's newly launched CBD Scalp Calming collection, which includes a shampoo, a conditioner, a hydrating mask, and a hair oil.  

In a statement, the haircare guru noted: 'The new CBD Scalp Calming collection builds on our unwavering commitment to offering consumers on-trend ingredients coupled with salon grade clean and sustainable haircare products.

'We couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate the launch than hiring someone to put the products to the ultimate test.'
