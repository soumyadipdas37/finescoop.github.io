Newcastle head coach Steve Bruce has revealed injured duo Allan Saint-Maximin and Jamal Lewis suffered no lasting damage during Sunday's 3-0 Premier League defeat by Brighton.

Frenchman Saint-Maximin limped off before the break having aggravated an ankle problem, while £13.5million summer signing Lewis suffered a cut eye in a challenge which led to Yves Bissouma's late dismissal.

Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Wednesday night's Carabao Cup third round trip to Morecambe, Bruce said: 'Saint-Maximin had a scan on his ankle. He's tweaked it and twisted it, but we don't think it's that serious.

'We don't think he'll make tomorrow, but he'll have a chance for Sunday.

'We were worried about Jamal's eye, but that seems to be OK, although it's closed at the minute and has a cut above it. He won't be involved in the cup game, but thankfully there's no lasting damage.'

Bruce made 10 changes for the 1-0 victory over Blackburn in the last round and will adopt a similar approach this time around.

He said: 'We all have to look at the situation and have a bit of rotation. Now, we've got a squad of players where we're able to pick a different XI.

'We'll pick a team I hope is going to be good enough and strong enough to get us into the next round.'
