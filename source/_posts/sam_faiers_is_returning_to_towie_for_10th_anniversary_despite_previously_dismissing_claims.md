 Sam Faiers is reportedly set to return to TOWIE.

The Mummy Diaries star, 29, shot to fame on the ITVBe show as one of the original stars in its 2010 inauguration yet has since claimed she would not return to the screens alongside fellow alums for the 10th anniversary celebrations.

Despite this, insiders tell The Sun: 'Sam has been very vocal about her ­dislike for the show once she left, despite it making her... But despite kicking it previously, she's now happy to return, presumably at great expense to TOWIE bosses.'

Sam shot to fame in TOWIE in 2010, with her on-off relationship with Mark Wright and her subsequent engagement to Joey Essex making her a show hit. 

Since leaving the show, she has scooped her own reality show, The Mummy Diaries, with her partner Paul Knightley and their kids, Paul, five, and Rosie, two.  

Despite previous claims she would not return, The Sun report: 'Sam has been very vocal about her ­dislike for the show once she left, despite it making her...

'She saw it as a different part of her life. She's a mum now and that was a time she barely recognises. But despite kicking it previously, she's now happy to return, presumably at great expense to TOWIE bosses.'

That was then... Her friendship with Amy Childs - who is returning for the anniversary - was one of the central elements and won the hearts of many fans (pictured with Amy and Kirk Norcross in 2010)

Her friendship with Amy Childs - who is returning for the anniversary - was one of the central elements and won the hearts of many fans. 

In 2011, Sam said of their now-defunct friendship: 'When she was in Celebrity Big Brother I gave her all the support in the world...

'I put her in my column and tweeted about her constantly. But when the last series of TOWIE started I didn't even get a text or a phone call. I feel very let down...

'TOWIE was a massive thing for both of us, and it would only take one phone call to show we're still friends. We're just not close any more and it's sad.'

In a chat with Closer, Sam detailed her contribution to the anniversary: 'We're not going back on to the show to film as such but we're doing the 10 year anniversary best bits so we'll be looking back at old clips and all the TOWIE best moments.'

Despite this, she previously said: 'I won't be getting involved because, to be honest, it's like I'm at a completely different stage in my life now,' she told The Sun. 'I don't even know what I would do on there any more.

'I've got my own life with my kids, and TOWIE is ten years ago for me. You just can't compare my life then to my life now.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Sam and TOWIE for comment.
