They're set to reunite together on the sixth film in the Jurassic Park franchise.

And Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum enjoyed a break from set on Monday to record a fun video together in which they sang I Remember You by Frank Ifield.

The actor, 72, and Thor: Ragnarok star, 67, were in great spirits as they sang to each other, with Jeff ad-libbing to complement Sam's cheery rendition of the song.

'I remember you': Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum reunited in fun Twitter video as the Jurassic Park stars sang together during a break from set of the franchise's sixth film on Monday

Jeff looked like his usual dapper self as he donned a black jacket over a turtleneck top, while he covered his salt-and-pepper locks with a fedora.

While Sam kept things casual in a simple white shirt as he sang his heart out to Jeff's skilful piano playing beside him.

Sam also shared a video of them singing to Andy Williams' September Song, joking about their performance, which was shaky at first, he wrote: 'Another #JamWithJeff. 

'Hers the thing- #JeffGoldblum flatly refuses to rehearse. So every time is the first time. (sic)'

Looking sharp: Jeff looked like his usual dapper self as he donned a black jacket over a turtleneck top, while he covered his salt-and-pepper locks with a fedora

Sing-a-long: Sam also shared a video of them singing Andy Williams' September Song, joking about their performance he said Jeff 'flatly refuses to rehearse. So every time is the first time'

Sam revealed last month that he was heading out on set for his first day filming as he shared a picture of his character and wrote: 'Tomorrow I’m back in The Grant Hat and into the Whole Jurassic World. Terror knows no bounds!'

He followed this with a tweet, adding: 'Hold onto your hats - gettin' my old one back on this week, and facing off dinosaurs once again!'

The actor then went on to remark that he thinks Jurassic World: Dominion is the 'best' film in the series so far by adding: 'Best yet. Excited and terrified - these things will kill ya!'

Exciting: Sam revealed last month that he was heading out on set for his first day filming as he shared a picture of his character 

Getting into character: Sam also shared a picture of the fedora that was placed safely in his trailer, ready for him to wear for the day's shoot and looking exactly like his original attire

He tagged co-star Laura, as well as fellow returnee Jeff Goldblum, who starred alongside them in Jurassic Park as Dr Ian Malcolm, reprising that role for original sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park and fifth movie Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

Sam also tagged stars Bryce Dallas Howard  and Chris Pratt, as well as writer/director Colin Trevorrow, who was responsible for rebooting the dormant franchise in 2015.

Sam added: 'I'm obviously a little more... grizzled now!'

Dr in the house: Laura Dern also posted a snap, of her Ellie Sattler action figure. She captioned this, 'In quarantine getting ready to get back to work. #jurassicworlddominion'

Cast who have flown from the US to London to appear in the new film, which shoots at Buckinghamshire's Pinewood Studios, have had to isolate ahead of going on set.

Bryce and Chris have already begun work, but also had to quarantine, with the former proudly showing off her bruises from performing her own stunts last week. 

Appearing on This Morning last month, Sam joked that he and Jeff have asked Laura to do the COVID-19 safety 'homework' for them, before they return.

Back together: Jurassic World stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt have been updating fans from the set already

'We are about to begin again. I should be in the UK all things being equal in a couple of weeks - at Pinewood working under very strict protocols,' he explained. 'We'll be breaking new ground in fact, we are the first big film to get back into production and it's going to be very interesting to see the process.

'I am very excited about it... it's going to be a terrific film! I'm very much looking forward to meeting my old friends again.'

He also joked that he and Jeff won't be poring through the alleged 100-page COVID-19 regulation document that the cast are said to be being provided before they get to work post-lockdown, and have instead asked Laura to read it and give them the gist of it.

'We've gotten Laura to do the homework!' he laughed. 

Brutal! Bryce and Chris have already begun work, but also had to quarantine. Bryce proudly showed off her bruises from performing her own stunts last week

It was recently revealed that the newest film in the franchise is implementing a 'drive-thru coronavirus test facility'.

The Jurassic Park sequel was announced as the first major film to get back to work after the COVID-19 shutdown, but with 'rigorous safety protocols on-site' in guidance with post-lockdown regulations.

And this has been revealed to feature the drive-thru facility, which will see everyone involved in the film going through it before gaining access to the set.

What's in store? Little is known about the plot, aside from the fact that the dinosaurs - including the original park's Tyrannosaur [pictured] - are now on the mainland

A source told The Sun: 'This is the future of movies and hopefully it can prove successful. We need to get these productions back on track and fast.

'There are millions of pounds at stake, and it’s going to take months to catch up so this solution seems a good way to put minds at rest.

'Everyone on set, from the runners to the leading stars, will have to drive through the testing station — and only those who pass the checks will be allowed on set. One person showing symptoms somewhere like this could be totally catastrophic!'

Production has been delayed by around three months, with speculation rife that the sequel could face a later release date. 

Life finds a way: Sam said last month that the sets were built 'ready and waiting' for things to resume after shooting began in Canada earlier this year
