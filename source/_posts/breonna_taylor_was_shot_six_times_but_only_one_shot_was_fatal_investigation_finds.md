The three officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor fired 32 times after barging into her apartment, but only one shot was determined to be fatal, investigators found.

The Jefferson County grand jury on Wednesday announced the results of its inquiry into the death of 26-year-old EMT, who was killed in her apartment during a police raid on March 13.  

Louisville Officer Brett Hankison, who was fired in June, was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing into Taylor's neighbors' homes. 

Sgt Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, who were also present during the deadly raid, were not indicted. 

Louisville police have declared a state of emergency ahead of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's announcement about whether he will charge officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor (pictured)

In a press conference shortly after the grand jury's decision, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron gave a detailed account of the sequence of events, which he said was pieced together by ballistics reports, 911 calls, and witness interviews, due to the lack of bodycam footage.  

The investigation shed light into Taylor's final moments, revealing she was shot a total of six times while standing in the hallway of her home alongside boyfriend Kenneth Walker.

Earlier reports had said Taylor was sleeping in bed when officers barged in and opened fire. 

It also confirmed cops did indeed knock after arriving at apartment 4 of 3003 Springfield Drive in the early hours of March 13. 

According to investigators' findings, Taylor was shot a total of six times, but medical evidence indicated that only one shot was fatal. 

'Further medical evidence shows Ms Taylor would have died from the fatal shot within a few seconds to two minutes after being struck,' Cameron said.

The charges stem from Hankison's bullets travelling into a neighboring apartment when he and two other officers opened fire. Pictured above are the bullet holes found in Taylor's apartment

Walker was determined to have fired the first round, striking Sgt Mattingly in the leg. 

Mattingly was the only officer to enter the apartment, where he said he saw Walker holding a gun. 

'In his statement [Mattingly] says that the male was holding a gun, arms extended, in a shooting stance,' Cameron said. 

'Sergeant Mattingly saw the man's gun fire, heard a boom. Immediately knew he was shot as a result of feeling heat in his upper thigh.'

Cameron said there was no evidence to support that Sergeant Mattingly was hit by friendly fire from other officers. 

Walker also previously admitted that he fired one shot and was the first to shoot. 

'Sergeant Mattingly returned fire down the hallway. Mattingly fired six shots. Almost simultaneously, detective Cosgrove also in the doorway, shot 16 times. This all took place in a matter of seconds,' Cameron said.  'In total, six bullets struck Ms Taylor.'

Meanwhile, Detective Hankison, who was the only cop charged in the case, had fired his weapon ten times including from an outside sliding glass door and through a bedroom window. 

Some bullets traveled through apartment 4 and into apartment 3 before some exited that apartment. 

At the time, three residents of apartment 3  were at home including a male, a pregnant female, and a child, Cameron said.  

'There is no conclusive evidence that any bullets fired from detective Hankison's weapon struck Ms Taylor.' 

 

 

 

ergeant Mattingly and detectives Cosgrove and Hankison had no known involvement in the obtainment of the search warrant executed on March 13.  

Mattingly was the first and the only officer to enter the residence, where he saw Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker open fire. 

There is no evidence to support that sergeant Mattingly was hit by friendly fire from other officers.  

Mattingly returned fire with six shots. Almost simultaneously, detective Cosgrove also in the doorway, shot 16 times. 

In total, six bullets struck Taylor, but only one was determined to be fatal.    

Detective Hankison fired his weapon ten times, firing bullets into apartment 4 and apartment 3.

At the time, three residents of apartment 3 were at home including a male, pregnant female, and a child. 

There is no conclusive evidence that any bullets fired from detective Hankison's weapon struck Taylor. 

The ballistics analysis did not identify which of the three officers fired the fatal shot. 

The FBI investigation later concluded the fatal shot was fired by detective Cosgrove.  

Investigation found Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in the use of force after Walker opened fire.
