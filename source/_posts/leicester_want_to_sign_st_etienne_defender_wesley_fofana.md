Leicester City want St Etienne's teenage defender Wesley Fofana but are reluctant to meet the French club's £27m valuation.

AC Milan and Everton have also checked on 19-year-old Fofana who was outstanding last season though Leicester were looking to offer closer to £18m, Brendan Rodgers utilised midfielder Wilfried Ndidi at centre-back on Saturday. 

Rodgers is also keen to add another winger.

The Foxes recently got some business over the line as they signed defender Timothy Castagne from Atalanta in a deal worth £22million.

Rodgers sealed the Belgian's signature following Ben Chilwell's £50million exit to Chelsea, as the 24-year-old international penned a five-year deal with Leicester.

They are also remaining interested in Celtic striker Odsonne Edouard, however they are unlikely to make a move whilst the Scottish champions remain firm on their £40m asking price.
