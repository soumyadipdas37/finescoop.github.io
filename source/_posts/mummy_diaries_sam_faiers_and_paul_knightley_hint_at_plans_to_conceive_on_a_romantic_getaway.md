Sam Faiers and Paul Knightley revealed they want to have two more children once their son Paul Jr., four, and daughter Rosie, two, start school on this week's Sam and Billie: The Mummy Diaries. 

During a family picnic, the former TOWIE star, 29, and the estate agent, 31, hinted at their plans to conceive on a 'romantic getaway in a couple of years'.

The parents initially butted heads on how big they'd like to grow their family, but eventually settled on having a total of four kids.

Media personalities Sam and Paul took their little ones on a trip around Surrey for the first time since moving into their rented home in March.

Picking up on her young boy's impressive animal knowledge, the former glamour model said: 'He's going to be teaching us stuff. He's into the globe at the moment. He loves animals and it shows how kind he is.'

The influencer also shared her worries about Rosie missing her brother's company once he enrols into reception and insisted she intends to send her to nursery when she turns three, unlike Paul who stayed at home until he turned the school starting age. 

Sam said on the show, which was filmed a few months ago: 'She's going to miss him when he goes to school. When she's three, we should look into taking her to nursery.'

'When is the right time?' The former TOWIE star, 29, and the estate agent, 31, hinted at their plans to conceive on a 'romantic getaway in a couple of years'

Confessing his reservations over sending her to pre-school, father-of-two Paul added: 'It'll be nice for us to have some time with her before returning to school.'

The Essex native later switched gears to discuss baby-making plans as she said: 'It's only going to be a couple of years when they go to school, so we'll go on a romantic getaway and have another baby.'

When asked whether he wants to have six children, fitness enthusiast Paul said: 'No, I wanted five before we had children, but now I say four.'

Her sister Billie, 30, meanwhile, held back tears as her daughter Nelly, six, returned to year 1 in a 'small bubble' after coronavirus forced the closure of education centres across the nation in March.

The InTheStyle ambassador detailed: 'Today feels like the first day of school, she's really happy. We were worried at first but we do feel like it's the right thing. Nelly will benefit from it and we need routine back in our lives.'

The outspoken child kicked off her day in great spirits before she was left feeling 'nervous' when she pulled up at her school.

Joined by husband Greg Shepherd and son Arthur, three, Billie became emotional as she saw Nelly's 'face drop'.

'You feel their emotions': Joined by husband Greg Shepherd and son Arthur, three, Billie became emotional as she saw Nelly's 'face drop'

Attempting to stop herself from crying, she added: 'When she's upset, I'm upset. You feel their emotions. She got all nervous.'

Elsewhere in the episode, Greg accidentally left his children terrified after his fun family surprise spectacularly backfired.

The reality star, 35, was tasked with looking after his children while wife Billie got ready for a photoshoot upstairs.

And when Greg surprised his two children with a huge dinosaur in the garden, the youngsters were left hysterical as they started crying and screaming over the elaborate gift.

Trying to encourage the youngsters to meet the dinosaur, Greg said: 'Arthur, do you want to come meet him? He's our friend, Arthur.'

To which his scared kids started crying even more as the dinosaur, which was a man dressed in a huge costume, roamed the garden.

And things went from bad to worse when the noise interrupted a fuming Billie as she came downstairs to comfort her two children.

Trying to calm them down, she said: 'It's just pretend, it's just pretend,' with Nelly screaming: 'No!'

Attempting to make a joke out of the situation, Greg quipped: 'Be careful if you are living in Brentwood... there's a T-Rex on the loose!'

Speaking behind-the-scenes, the blonde explained: 'I get that he thought this was going to be great but actually we avoided going to a kid's birthday party a few months ago because they had one of these T-Rex dinosaurs there.

'We knew Nelly and Arthur wouldn't like it! It completely backfired and all it did was prolong my shoot.' 

Going back to the scene of the dinosaur, Billie was forced to take her hysterical children upstairs to get away from the huge costume.

While a sheepish Greg had to send away the dinosaur hire company and apologise for his upset children.

He said: 'They're having none of it, they won't even come downstairs at the moment. Thanks, I appreciate it.'

And when the businessman went upstairs, he was confronted by an annoyed Billie who said: 'Greg, you dealt with that all wrong.'

Uh oh: Going back to the scene of the dinosaur, Billie was forced to take her hysterical children upstairs to get away from the huge costume 

Explaining his actions, Greg said: 'I didn't intend, if you had helped me' with Billie replying: 'I didn't know what was going on!'

Feeling deflated over his backfired surprise, he went downstairs while his two children continued to cry over the dinosaur.

And as well as Billie, the father-of-two was told off by his mini-me as she joked in a behind-the-scene clip: 'Naughty daddy!' 

The Mummy Diaries continues on Thursdays 9pm on ITVBe.
