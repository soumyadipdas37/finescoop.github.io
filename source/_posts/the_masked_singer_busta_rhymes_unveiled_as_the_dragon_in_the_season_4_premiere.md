Busta Rhymes was revealed to be the Dragon on the Season 4 premiere of The Masked Singer, which aired Wednesday on FOX.

The 48-year-old singer, known for hits like Dangerous and Don't Cha, with the Pussycat Dolls, had underwhelmed voters with his cover of LL Cool J's Mama Said Knock You Out.

When he unmasked, he said that wearing the dragon costume made him feel like he was 'in an oxygen tank without oxygen.'

'Busta, you know how much I love you,' said panelist Nicole Scherzinger, 42, who'd recorded Don't Cha with him. 'You are rap royalty. There will never be another artist like you.'

In his clue package, Busta said that 'dressing up in funky, outrageous costumes' wasn't new to him, and admitted that 'like a dragon,' he'd been on a long quest to be the best.

Nicole and panelist Robin Thicke, 43, figured it was Busta behind the mask, citing a visual Statue of Liberty clue that hinted at his Brooklyn, NY birth, and a reference to his song Calm Down.

'He's outrageous,' Robin added. 'And he has three albums with the word 'dragon' in it.'

Other clues in Busta's pre-taped video included a dinosaur, which nodded to the Reptar character he played in the Rugrats movie, and a barbell, which referenced his fit physique.

Panelist Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, 47, initially thought the Dragon was Detroit Lions football player Adrian Peterson, 35, but changed her answer to rapper DMX, 49.

This season, panelists can win a Golden Ear trophy for having the most correct first impressions.

Panelist Ken Jeong, 51, first believed Dragon could be Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, 34, then seemed sure it might be Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, 35.

But show host Nick Cannon, 39, could tell who the Dragon was by his loping walk, writing 'My big brother Busta Rhymes' on a card before the star unmasked.

As the show started, Nick made reference to the coronavirus pandemic, saying, 'Finally, we have something fun involving masks.'

According to press reports, the Masked Singer addressed current filming restrictions by using old video of its audiences to fill in for a live audience, animating its video packages and recruiting superfans to vote for the season's contestants as they sang.

Wednesday's show was the debut of Group A, the first six of the season's 16 singers.
