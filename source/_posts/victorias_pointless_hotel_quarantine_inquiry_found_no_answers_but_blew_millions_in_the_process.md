The taxpayer-funded budget for the inquiry into Victoria's bungled hotel quarantine program has blown out to $5.7million.

Premier Daniel Andrews has approved an extra $2.7million to the inquiry board, on top of the $3million originally allocated by the Victorian government. 

The independent inquiry, chaired by retired judge Jennifer Coate, is examining Victoria's botched hotel quarantine program which sparked the state's second horror wave of coronavirus cases.

So far, 794 Victorians have died and five million Melburnians have been forced to endure weeks of Stage Four lockdown.

An inquiry spokesman said the board expects its final expenditure to be under $5.7million and assured leftover funds will be given back to the state government.

'The additional funding is necessary for the board to complete its work due to the logistical difficulties presented by the pandemic, which included transitioning the chair, counsel and all staff to remote hearings as well as the live streaming of hearings featuring 63 remote witnesses,' he told NCA Newswire.

Mr Andrews told reporters on Tuesday he didn't know why the inquiry board requested the additional $2.7million, but that the government would support it.

The inquiry was set up to examine how outbreaks among security staff at several quarantine hotels in mid-May and June sparked the state's second wave of the virus

Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos resigned on Saturday after she was named by Mr Andrews as the minister responsible for the program.

The inquiry is now sifting through the final submissions and more than 200,000 documents after six weeks of hearings ended last week.

The inquiry's final findings will be handed down November 6.

The public hearings have already been slammed by some commentators and Victorians, after it  find the person responsible for allowing private security guards to work in the hotels.

Victoria recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus and four deaths on Wednesday, bringing down the 14-day average to 16.4 in Melbourne and 0.3 in regional Victoria.
