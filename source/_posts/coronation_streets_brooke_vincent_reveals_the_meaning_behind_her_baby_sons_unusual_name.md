During her brief appearance on Loose Womens, she also revealed that she was shocked how long it took her to return to her original shape. 

She added: ''A lot of my friends had children in the past and it's just one of those things that wasn't spoken about, you didn't know you have a baby then however long to get back into your jeans...

Talk then turned to an Instagram post shared in November in which she detailed the pressures of motherhood in a candid message.

The Manchester native started off her post by revealing she was gearing up to enjoy her first date night since giving birth to Mexx, but opted to stay at home as she felt like a 'completely different person'.

Brooke explained: 'Tonight I was supposed to look completely different, I was supposed to be dressed up, hair and make up done ready to eat some nice food and maybe have my first cocktail in 11 months with Kean.

'Our first time away from Mexx for an hour or two, instead I look like this. I look like this because I naively thought that 4 weeks after my baby I would be in all my old clothes looking exactly like I did before I got pregnant.' [sic]
