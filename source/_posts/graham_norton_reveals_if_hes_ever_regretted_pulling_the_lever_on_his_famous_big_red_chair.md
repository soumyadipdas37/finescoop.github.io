Graham Norton gave a brutally honest answer when asked if he's ever regretted pulling the lever on someone during an interview on The Project on Tuesday.

The 57-year-old TV host has a segment on his celebrity chat show, The Graham Norton Show, where everyday people are invited to tell stories.

They have only seconds to capture his attention, and if he's not enjoying the story, he pulls a lever, which flips their chair and subsequently ends their tale.

But after being asked by The Project's Waleed Aly if he's ever 'regretted' pulling the lever, Graham confessed he's not invested enough to even care.

'I mean, it's somebody telling a story. Who really cares?! Who cares?!' he laughed.

His blunt response prompted a stunned Carrie Bickmore to brand the veteran TV star 'so tough'.

But Graham confessed there have been times where he's momentarily thought he would've liked to hear the end of the story.

Still, he insisted that '99.9 per cent' of the time, pulling the lever was the right decision, despite often facing criticism from the celebrities on his show.  

'Sometimes the guests insist that people come back and I would say 99.9 per cent of times, they regret that decision, because I was right!' he continued.

'It was going nowhere! You thought it was going somewhere - it wasn't.' 

After taking a break from filming amid the coronavirus pandemic, it was revealed The Graham Norton Show would be returning to air next month.

Celebrity guests will now either dial in via video call, or will be positioned around the studio on socially distanced chairs instead of the usual couch.
