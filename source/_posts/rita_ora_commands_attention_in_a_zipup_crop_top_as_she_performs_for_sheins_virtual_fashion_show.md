In the romance department, blonde beauty Rita is currently dating Greek-French director Romain Gavras, 39, who she was first seen together in July after a night of partying. 

Speaking to The Sun, friends insisted she was involved with the filmmaker after she was seen enjoying a boozy night out with business tycoon Faton Gashi.

A source said: 'Rita was hitting the town with friends including Faton. But she's in a serious thing with Romain and properly loved up. It's the first time she's been serious with someone in ages.'

Her previous boyfriends include Calvin Harris, Andrew Garfield, Rob Kardashian, musician Andrew Watt and Ricky Hil - the son of fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.

The media personality had spent lockdown working on new music while also enjoying time with her friends in the countryside.
