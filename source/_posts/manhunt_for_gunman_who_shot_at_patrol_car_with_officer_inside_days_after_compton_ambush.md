A manhunt has been launched for a gunman in Virginia who opened fire at a marked police car with an officer inside - just days after two cops were critically injured in a similar ambush in Los Angeles. 

Police said an unidentified suspect shot at a moving patrol car at about 7.25pm on Tuesday in Suffolk, leaving at least three bullet holes in the side of the vehicle.  

The officer who was driving was not injured. Their name has not been released. 

A large police presence remained at the scene on North Broad Street for hours after the shooting as investigators collected evidence and searched the area for the gunman.

Authorities have not released any description of the suspect or speculated on the motive for the attack. 

A manhunt has been launched for a gunman who opened fire at a marked police car with an officer inside in Suffolk, Virginia, on Tuesday night. The Suffolk Police Department released the photo above showing three bullet holes in the side of the patrol car

The shooting occurred on the 200 block of North Broad Street (shown above in file photo)

Investigators asked anyone with information to contact the Suffolk Police Department via the Crime Line at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP or by submitting a tip online. 

A $1,000 reward is being offered for tips that lead to an arrest.  

The Suffolk shooting came just three days after a gunman fired multiple shots into a patrol car in the Compton neighborhood of Los Angeles on Saturday night, striking two deputies. 

Both deputies were struck in the head by gunshots, but miraculously both are in stable condition and expected to survive. One is a 24-year-old male and the other is a 31-year-old former librarian and mother of a six-year-old child.

A massive manhunt is underway for that shooter, described as a 28 to 30-year-old black male. 

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is offering a $100,000 reward for information that leads to his capture, and President Donald Trump called him an animal who deserves the death penalty.

The Compton shooting sparked nationwide controversy as bystanders were filmed mocking the bloodied officers at the scene and protesting outside the hospital where they are recovering. 

The videos of protesters enraged many critics who said the shooting was the result of anti-police sentiment fueled by a turbulent summer of demonstrations against police brutality.
