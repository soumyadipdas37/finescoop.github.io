Foodies have shown off the incredible grazing platters they have put together at home using budget groceries and buys from the likes of Kmart, Big W and Bunnings Warehouse.

Hundreds posted on Facebook, where they said you do not have to spend a fortune in order to enjoy a feast, whether it's for a birthday, a party or even a wedding reception.

Men and women shared photos of their elaborate grazing platters and revealed exactly how they made them.

Many said they relied on trays including the round acacia board from Kmart (pictured) to whip up delicious feasts

One woman called Daynah Jade said she has her own grazing platter business and she revealed that the only boards she uses for her business are from Kmart.

'Their boards are just the best quality,' Daynah said.

Others commented to say that any board from Kmart looks much more expensive than it really is. 

Some of the discount store's most popular boards that have been used as grazing platters in the past include the Embossed Wooden Serving Board with Handles for $18, and the Long Acacia Serving Board ($16).

'I bought a $12 plank of plywood from Bunnings and covered it with the Kmart marble contact and made our cheeseboard on that,' one woman called Eliza Reid explained, next to a photo of her grazing board.

'All this food was only $100 and fed 20 people.' 

Some topped their boards high with fruits and cheeses, as well as homemade wraps for family birthday events

The key to a good platter (a birthday platter pictured) is to make one where everything is easy to eat and finger food so people can just pick it up and enjoy

Others said they pick up a lot of materials for grazing boards from the likes of Big W, IKEA, Target and Bunnings to make their platters (pictured)

'Bunnings tiles are a great budget tip!' one womn posted.

'My husband got the idea from a really fancy place and the Bunnings tiles can be about $1 each.'

Founder of KD Grazing Veronika Gentile recommends that you keep everything on your board as fresh as possible if you want to create the perfect platter

'If it's not in season, skip it! Go for bright colours and a variety of sweet and savoury. I absolutely love mixing caramel popcorn with salted pretzels,' the expert said (platter pictured)

While you can have standout pieces like a cob loaf (pictured), it's also important to have lots of little pieces that people want to eat

* Pick a platter that is plain enough to let the cheese shine. Steer clear of bright colours, patterns or plastic and go for wood or marble.

* He recommends investing in a decent set of cheese knives, they make a huge difference.

* To construct, place your cheeses onto the board with equal space between them.

* Add your crackers (lavosh) to the board, and if you're going to use grissini as well, place them in a jar or glass.

* Place big bunches of grapes in the empty areas on the board (make sure they're generous bunches) and then add your quince, pate (if you like it), fruit, nuts, and chocolate.

* Make sure you've got a good balance of colour across the board, and if there are any bland areas, hit it with some strawberries or blueberries.

* Less is not more and instead of buying 10 things, buy three and lots of them.

* Favourite pairings: His favourite Champagne pairings would be Ruinart blanc de blanc or Billecart-Salmon Brut Rosé.

Previously, experts including mother-of-two and founder of KD Grazing Veronika Gentile shared their tips for putting together the perfect grazing board.

The 30-year-old told FEMAIL that her biggest tip to putting together a masterful design is to keep it easy for guests to eat, because no one wants to 'stand around holding a big roll at an event'.

Veronika also recommends making the quality of your products the primary concern with only the freshest ingredients on offer.

'If it's not in season, skip it! Go for bright colours and a variety of sweet and savoury. I absolutely love mixing caramel popcorn with salted pretzels,' she said.

While there are meant to be overlaps on the board it's best not to overcrowd the table in general.

'You can have standout pieces like a beautifully cut rockmelon but a big tray of watermelon, even though it tastes good, can look messy,' Veronika said. 

Alex Cadger, from Sydney, who runs the business The Blonde Butler, which charges $250 on average for a platter, said he is all about high quality spoils, so you'll never see cabanossi or a Jatz cracker on his boards.

'I love grapes for the fruit but I always use figs, dried apricots, dried pears and dried peaches as well,' Alex told FEMAIL. 

'I also love Spanish quince paste, I think it's the best of the quinces.'

He said big no-nos to avoid are placing ingredients on the platter that are off-the-shelf supermarket items.

'You don't need heaps and heaps of colours or that really intense "colours of the rainbow" look,' he continued.
