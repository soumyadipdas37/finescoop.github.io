Justin Savoie, 24, has been sentenced to 90 days in prison after he was caught concealing a loaded pistol in his buttocks

A Louisiana man has been sentenced to 90 days in prison after he was caught concealing a loaded pistol in his buttocks. 

Justin Savoie, 24, plead guilty to felony weapons charges in Lafourche Parish District Court on Friday - nine months after cops discovered the gun in the unlikely hiding place during a strip search. 

 Savoie was arrested on December 28, 2019, at a home in the tiny town of Golden Meadow after police responded to reports of 'suspicious activity'. 

Officers discovered marijuana and drug paraphernalia inside the residence, as well as several guns and a homemade silencer inside Savoie's truck, parked outside. 

The Louisiana local was taken into custody, according to The Smoking Gun, where he was subject to a strip search. 

During a pat down, police pulled out a .25 caliber Titan pistol from Savoie's buttocks. 

Savoie was concealing a .25 caliber Titan pistol, identical to the one pictured above 

The weapon - which was 4.3 inches long and had a 2.5 inch barrel - was loaded. 

Savoie was subsequently charged with drugs and weapons offences, and released on a $10,600 bond. 

During his sentencing on Friday, Savoie was ordered to serve 90 days in  jail, and was additionally given a three-year suspended sentence. 

He has also been banned from owning or possessing firearms. 

Police were called to a residence in the tiny town of Golden Meadow last December, where they discovered that Savoie was in possession of guns and drugs
