Wolves are close to adding 20-year-old Porto midfielder Vitor Ferreira on loan with view to a £17.9m permanent deal. 

Known as Vitinha, his arrival follows Fabio Silva’s £35m move from Porto on Saturday and Fernando Marcal from Lyon on Sunday. 

The 31-year-old left back, who featured and helped Lyon reach the 2019-20 Champions League semi-finals, has signed a two-year deal at Molineux.

The Brazilian reported for testing on Monday at Wolves HQ, one week before Nuno Espirito Santo's side begin their Premier League season away to Sheffield United.

Club chairman Jeff Shi expressed his delight with Wolves' latest capture, as he told the club website: 'We are very pleased Marcal has joined the pack.

'Having played over 280 games in top leagues, as well as Champions League football, Marçal will add a huge amount of experience to our young team.

'He is a player with the technical ability to be able to contribute in the build up play from the back, all the way through to threatening the opposition in the final phase.'
