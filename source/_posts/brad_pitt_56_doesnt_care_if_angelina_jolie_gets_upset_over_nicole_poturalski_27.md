Brad Pitt took his new rumoured girlfriend, 27-year-old model Nicole Poturalski, to Chateau Miraval in the south of France this week.

The move seemed calculated as almost exactly six years ago, the 56-year-old actor wed his estranged wife Angelina Jolie there. Their wedding anniversary is August 23, 2014.

And on Wednesday a source told UsWeekly that the Oscar-winning Troy actor simply doesn't care if the Maleficent actress gets so angry that she retaliates.

Nice going: Brad Pitt took his new 'girlfriend' Nicole Poturalski to Chateau Miraval in the south of France recently

Painful: The chateau is where Brad and Angeline Jolie wed in 2014. In fact, it is very close to their wedding anniversary date which was August 23

'Taking Nicole to Miraval on their former wedding anniversary, Brad knows exactly what he is doing and the reaction it’s going to get from Angelina,' a source told the site.

'He just doesn’t care if Angelina is going to lash out. He expects she will.'

Brad and Angelina were married at the Chateau Miraval, located in the village of Correns, just over six years ago.

The intimate ceremony was only attended by a handful of guests and their six children: Maddox, 19, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 12.

The couple filed for divorce in 2016, and they're still engaged in an ongoing custody battle.

According to E! News, Pitt and his lady friend landed in France in late August. Nicole is reportedly staying with Brad while he's at the vineyard over the weekend.

According to a local, Brad is visiting Miraval because he's 'participating in a campaign for his wine.'

The chateau, which he and Angelina purchased in 2011 for $60 million, is famous for its wines, especially its rosé. He also just launched a champagne.

The rumored couple were spotted exactly one week ago - August 26 - as they stepped off a private plane in the south of France, after flying from LAX in Los Angeles to the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, before transferring.

'They were kissing and Brad was being super attentive to her,' a source told OK! magazine. 'He was in a semi public place but didn’t seem to mind people seeing him. She’s a real beauty and obviously a lot younger than him.'

Most recently, the Tomb Raider actress moved to have the judge overseeing her divorce trial removed due to business dealings he has with one of Brad's lawyers.

She's also reportedly considering moving with the children to the UK, which would make it considerably more difficult for her ex to spend time with the kids. 

Although Brad's potential relationship with Nicole is only now drawing widespread attention, the two may have been together for as long as nine months.

They were first spotted together in November during a performance of Kanye West's opera Nebuchadnezzar at the Hollywood Bowl.

The bombshell, who has a son, has graced the cover of ELLE and is currently signed to Next Management in Los Angeles and A Management in Germany.

She's also married to Berlin-based restaurateur Roland Mary, with whom she's allegedly in an open relationship.

The timeline also raises the possibility that the multi-lingual model may have been leaving messages for the Tree Of Life star on her Instagram.

'Missing my strolls with my Love,' she captioned a since-deleted post from February.

She followed it up with another post from March, which she captioned, 'Saturdays these days for me is self-reflection, reading books spending time with my better half.'

So far, the two have stayed quiet about a possible relationship.

In December, Brad shut down most rumors about his dating life during an interview with The New York Times.

'People always say they don't read about themselves. I never believe it,' he said. 'I don't go out of my way to avoid it; I just don't seek it out. I don't know how many women they've said I've been dating the last two or three years, and none of it's true.'

The Hollywood hunk previously shot down rumors that he was dating Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat.
