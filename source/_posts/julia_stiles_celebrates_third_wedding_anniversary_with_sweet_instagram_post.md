She's enjoyed a successful acting career for more than two decades.

But on Thursday, Julia Stiles celebrated a three-year anniversary as she marked the date she married husband Preston Cook in 2017.

She shared a photo of herself hugging her hubby with the ocean as backdrop and wrote on Instagram: 'Three years, six countries, two quarantines, and we haven’t killed each other. Happy Anniversary, Luv.'

The couple divide their time between the US and the South of France where Stiles shoots her TV show Riviera on which Cook works as a camera assistant.

They met back in late 2015 on the Oregon set of the film Blackwater in which Stiles starred with Anthony Hopkins and Cook was part of the crew.

The couple announced their engagement in January 2016 and tied the knot in September 2017 just a few weeks before the birth of their son.
