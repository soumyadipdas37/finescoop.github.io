A record number of Australian universities have been ranked among the best 200 in the world.  

The Times Higher Education Rankings 2021 list included 12 Australian institutes, with nine of those improving their positions from the previous year.

Top of the list was the University of Melbourne, coming in at 31st, followed by the University of Sydney at joint 51st.

The Australian National University was ranked 59th, followed by the University of Queensland at 62, Monash University at 64 and the University of New South Wales at 67. 

The University of Technology Sydney showed the most improvement, jumping a total 34 places to joint 160th.

The global list included more than 1,500 universities across 93 countries and regions, making them the largest and most diverse university rankings to date. 

This was followed closely by the University of Sydney (pictured) at joint 51st 

But educators fear the strong rankings could be short-lived as COVID-19 spells disaster for the country's tertiary education sector.

Times Higher Education chief knowledge officer Phil Baty said Australia's rankings may dwindle if border closures continue to impact international student numbers.

'But what we can reasonably assume is this is very vulnerable success [because] it is dependent on international students,' Mr Baty the Sydney Morning Herald.

While the University of Technology Sydney showed the most improvement, jumping a total 34 places to joint-160th

'The most significant thing will be losing income if there's a longer term reduction in international students. That funding pays for superstar researchers, doing quality research and driving up rankings.'

But he said Australia's handling of the pandemic could position it better for attracting international students than the United States or the United Kingdom.

'Australia and New Zealand have come out quite well despite the recent upsurge – perceptions of safety might advantage [them],' he said.

The University of Oxford retained the number one ranking for the fifth year in a row.
