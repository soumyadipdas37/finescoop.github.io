Shoppers will have just days to collect the Disney+ Ooshies collectables as Woolworths announced the promotion is set to end this week.

Availability of the collectables varies from store-to-store around Australia but online redemption of Ooshies will cease everywhere other than Victoria on Monday.

Customers living in Victoria will still have time to collect the figurines over the coming weeks after the launch was delayed across the state due to Stage Four lockdown restrictions.

Woolworths has announced shoppers will have just days to collect the Disney+ Ooshies collectables as the campaign is expected to end this weekend

'It's apparent customers of all ages have loved collecting these Ooshies and their popularity completely exceeded our expectations. Because of this, we expect the last of our stock to be collected by the end of this weekend,' Woolworths' chief marketing officer Andrew Hicks said.

Mr Hicks reassured Victorian shoppers there will be plenty of Ooshies around to collect in the weeks ahead while supplies last. 

'I want to reassure our Victorian customers these lower stock levels do not apply to them. We created a separate allotment from when we delayed the launch of the program,' he said.

He added: 'We're thrilled to see how many customers have enjoyed collecting the Disney+ Ooshies since its launch... particularly during a very challenging year.

'We'd like to thank our team for their support in executing the program in stores and online and our customers for helping us create such a memorable program.'

Shoppers can collect one of the 36 iconic characters from Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Pixar with every $30 spent at checkout.

Pre-loved or unwanted Ooshies can be recycled in any Woolworths store until January 31, 2021.

Customers can drop their Ooshies (including last year's Lion King Ooshies) and Ooshies wrappers in the dedicated TerraCycle bins in stores. 

TerraCycle will then turn these Ooshies into plastic pellets, which can be used to make outdoor products such as park benches.
