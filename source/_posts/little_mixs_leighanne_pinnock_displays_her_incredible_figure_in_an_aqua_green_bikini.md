She has been lapping up the sunshine in Mykonos, staying at five-star accommodation Loyal Villas Luxury.

And Leigh-Anne Pinnock looked incredible as she soaked up the sun with her lookalike sister Sarah and a pal on Monday. 

The Little Mix star, 28, slipped into an aqua green bikini which showcased her enviably-toned abs and slender figure.

The thong bikini, from her own swimwear range In A Seashell, highlighted her phenomenal physique. 

The low-scoop top showed off her taut midriff while the high-rise thong bottoms made the most of her peachy derriere.    

Leigh-Anne appeared to be having a blast as she dived into the pool while her friend captured the moment on camera. 



 

The British star has wasted no time in racking up the post-lockdown air-miles having recently returned from a trip to Ibiza. 

Leigh-Anne travelled to the Balearic party island for a close friend's hen-do before flying back to the UK for a two week quarantine ahead of her romantic Greek getaway. 

The singer accepted Watford striker Andre's marriage proposal during lockdown, and she recently admitted she's been planning her nuptials since she was 'a baby' and doesn't want a long engagement. 

Speaking during an appearance on The Official Big Top 40 on Capital and Heart, she said: 'So I've been planning it since I was a baby, if I'm honest.

'I know what I want, and I don't really want a long engagement so I feel like I'm just on this you know? I'm on it.'

Host Will Manning asked: 'So are you being good about it or are you being a bridezilla?'

Leigh-Anne responded: 'Bridezilla, it's bad.'
