Hailey Bieber recently got back to work, amid months of quarantine, as she jetted off to Italy for Milan Fashion Week.

But the model has since returned home to Los Angeles, where she's enjoying more romantic time with Justin. 

She donned a skintight plunging black latex bodysuit Monday, as she stepped out to grab dinner with her husband at the celeb favorite sushi hotspot Nobu Malibu.

The 23-year-old covered the look with an oversized double-breasted mustard blazer, featuring gold buttons.

She finished the ensemble with a black face mask, some gold necklaces and a pair of black stilettos with gold details. 

Justin, 26, kept it casual for dinner in a grey hoodie and a black beanie from his merch fashion line Drew House.

He and Hailey drove home in their blush Lamborghini Urus, which appeared the be parked in a handicap space.

She was previously spotted in all white, as she made a coffee run in West Hollywood, upon her homecoming from Milan.

The Drop the Mic host sported a white crop top with some matching skintight high-waisted pants and a white face mask.

Just one day before, she stepped out in an all-black look, with a knee-length duster, while posing for a selfie in front of her Versace billboard.

It comes after Justin dropped the video earlier this month for Holy, which featured cameos from Chance the Rapper, Wilmer Valderrama and Ryan Destiny.

He teased the song earlier this week on Twitter, as he attempted to shed his often problematic image for something of a moral Christian nature: 'New era. New single. It’s begins.'

The Canadian pop star plays a laid-off oil rig worker in the video, who ends up homeless along with his wife (Ryan), before being offered a warm plate by a passing soldier (Valderrama).

Although the message doesn't quite land visually, coming from someone who's never had to do manual labor a day in their life, the song appears to be more about how his marriage to Hailey is comparable to his faith in God.

For Hailey: The song appears to be about how his marriage to Hailey is comparable to his faith in God

He sings: 'Runnin' to the altar like a track star / Can't wait another second / 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me / Feels so holy'

Justin married Hailey in September of 2018 at a New York City courthouse, after reuniting at a Christian conference in June (they originally dated from December, 2015 to January, 2016), and popping the question in July.

He celebrated their second anniversary this month on Instagram, writing: '2 years today @haileybieber .. xoxo'

The power couple dropped $25.8million last month on their new home, a 11,145-square-foot, seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion in the upscale Beverly Park neighborhood of Beverly Hills.
