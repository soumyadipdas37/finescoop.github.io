An Indian couple who migrated to Melbourne have found fame through TikTok and Youtube after posting videos from home during lockdown.

Inder and Gurkirat Sarao arrived in Australia as international students from Punjab in 2014 before settling in north Melbourne. 

The couple used extra time at home through coronavirus lockdown sanctions to their advantage to make money and launch a growing career through social media.

'I quickly adapted to this new work-style of working from home. Not only did it help me save on traveling time, but it also gave me an opportunity to focus on YouTube as an additional source of income,' Mrs Sarao told SBS.

Posting videos became a much-needed source of income for the couple, as Mr Sarao was unable to find work in the highly competitive Melbourne taxi market.

'I tried my luck both with taxi and Uber, but it turned out to be a big challenge,' Mr Sarao said.

The couple's Bollywood-inspired content showcases fashion, cooking, relationships and culture, while also covering issues facing international students. 

Their combined Tik Tok channels @indersarao and @gurkiratrandhawa earned 22 million hits before the service was banned in India in June.

They shifted focus to Youtube, where their channel 'Inder and Kirat' has reached 125,000 subscribers.

Mrs Sarao said the couple's journey from India to Australia and the challenges they have faced along the way is a popular theme in their content. 

'We often discuss these issues in our videos. We are still in an early phase of our migration journey and we know it takes a lot of time and hard work to settle in Australia,' she said.

The couple bought a high definition video camera with money made from their Youtube videos and are actively pursuing social media as a source of income.

As their audience continues to steadily grow, Mrs Sarao said the couple aim to keep promoting positivity through their videos.
