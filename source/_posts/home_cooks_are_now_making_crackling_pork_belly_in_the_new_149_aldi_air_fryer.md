Home cooks are making 'delicious' crackling pork belly in Aldi's new air fryer, which launched to rave reviews in Australian stores on September 9.

Posting in a cookery group on Facebook, one man said he used the $149 all-in-one oven to make perfectly succulent pork covered in a crisp coating, which many have likened to gourmet cuts served at restaurants.

To prepare the meat he scored the skin, covered it in a salt and olive oil marinade and left it to rest in the fridge for a few hours.

Once marinated, he patted the pork with a paper towel to remove excess moisture, rubbed extra salt into the skin and cooked it in the air fryer – with each piece spread a few inches apart – for roughly 35 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius. 

In the comments section, people were quick to praise the new gadget which some say is superior to the cult favourite best-sellers flying off shelves at Kmart.

One woman said: 'I love mine. Salmon and chips tonight. All in together but turned salmon halfway through. Seasoned and oiled salmon before cooking'.

A second called it 'the best way to make pork crackling' while a third said the meat looked 'so delicious' she was heading out to buy an air fryer before cooking Sunday lunch. 

The enormous 16-litre cooker has been widely praised in cookery groups on Facebook, where people are comparing it to Kmart's cult favourite air fryer which costs $89

One disappointed Aldi shopper said her mother had queued up outside the store at 8am on Wednesday, September 9, the day of the launch, only to find the machines had already sold out.

And it's not hard to see why demand is so high.

Not only can the gadget crisp up food, there's also a dehydration function that preserves fruits and vegetables to prevent them from rotting. 

Other features include adjustable temperature control and an LED display.

As part of the new range, shoppers can expect to find a $499 'smart' thermo cooker (right), a $24.99 sausage roll maker (second from left) and a $59.99 food processor (fat left)

It also comes with an oil drip tray, a removable frying basket and a rotisserie spit with skewer set. 

Other standout pieces from Aldi's new kitchen range include a $499 'smart' thermo cooker with a three-litre bowl and seven-inch touchscreen that has built-in WiFi.

The best value on offer is a $24.99 pastry maker, perfect for sausage rolls and apple pies, followed by a $59.99 compact food processor with stainless steel blades that chop fruit and vegetables in seconds.
