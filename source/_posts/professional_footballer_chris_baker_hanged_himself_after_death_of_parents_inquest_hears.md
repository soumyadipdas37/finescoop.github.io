A retired professional footballer was found hanged on New Year's Day after losing both his parents.

Ex-Cardiff City defender Chris Barker, 39, who also played for Barnsley, QPR, and Plymouth, killed himself in the garage of his luxury home.

Barker - who retired as a player in 2017 - took his own life after being 'affected greatly' by the death of his parents.

Sheffield-born Mr Barker had left notes before hanging himself. Police found him the garage of his home in Cyncoed, Cardiff, on January 1.

Mr Barker made 162 appearances for the Bluebirds, helping the club to promotion to Division One in 2003.

The inquest heard he had taken up coaching roles after his playing career ended.

Nurse Amy Holliday had been in a relationship with him for about 18 months - but told the inquest that he was 'being distant' before Christmas.

He cancelled plans to meet - but she said she had 'never seen signs of depression or self-harm' in him.

Mr Barker's sister-in-law Tracey Barker said his death had 'shocked' the family and that there had been 'no warnings' that he had been having suicidal thoughts.

But she said he had been 'affected greatly' by the death of his father, who had motor neurone disease, and his mother, who died of cancer.

The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide at the Pontypridd inquest.

World in Motion, the sports management agency who represented Barker throughout his 18-year career, said his death was 'untimely and tragic.'

A spokesman said: 'Chris was a client throughout his outstanding playing career of over 500 League games for clubs including Barnsley, Cardiff City, Queens Park Rangers and Plymouth Argyle.

'Moreover, Chris was a wonderful person, an absolute gentleman and a pleasure to work for.'

Barker started his career with Alfreton Town in 1997. He later moved on to Barnsley and then Cardiff.

Cardiff released a statement in the wake of Mr Barker's death to pay tribute to the former player.

'Cardiff City Football Club has been deeply shocked and saddened at the passing of our former defender, Chris Barker.

'Chris was an extremely popular player both on and off the field, serving the club with distinction between 2002 and 2007.

Chris Barker played over 100 games for Southend between 2010 and 2013 as a defender

'He was awarded the Cardiff City FC Player of the Season award for his efforts during our 2004/05 campaign.

He played more than 170 games for the Bluebirds before later turning out for Southend.

Barker, who also played for Stoke, Colchester, QPR, Plymouth, Aldershot, Hereford and Weston-super-Mare, is believed to have left behind a partner and two daughters.

Barker's brother Richie is assistant manager at League One side Rotherham.
