She appeared on Big Brother Australia back in 2013.

And on Sunday, Tully Smyth revealed there's one reality TV dating show she'd never agree to sign up for.

Speaking to NCA NewsWire, the reality star, 32, said that producers 'couldn't pay her enough' to go on Channel Nine's Married At First Sight.

'I think originally it was a great concept, but over the years, it's kind of transformed into a different kind of beast,' she said. 

'It's just not something I can get behind,' she added. 

Tully's interview comes after she recently shared her views on Big Brother's reboot.

In June, the model and influencer tweeted her thoughts on the show and admitted she was 'a little disappointed' that the format had changed so much.

'Well then. As suspected, I'm a little disappointed the show's original format has changed SO much BUT it's early days,' she wrote.

'I'm sure they'll all grow on us over time... happy to have the big guy back on our screens regardless.'

Tully also said she didn't think that evictions were the same without a live audience, and that she thought the bedroom in the new house was 'tiny'.

During her stint on the show in 2013, she became embroiled in an affair scandal.

Tully cheated on her then-girlfriend, Tahlia Farrant, with fellow housemate Anthony Drew, sparking a national outrage.
