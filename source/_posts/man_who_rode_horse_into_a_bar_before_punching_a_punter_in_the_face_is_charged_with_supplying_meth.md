A tradie who rode a stolen horse into a pub before punching a patron in the head has admitted to dealing meth. 

Matthew Lawrence Grimstone, 25, was arrested after officers raided a house in Gympie, Queensland under a warrant for another man and found he had been supplying the other man with the drug. 

Officers examined the father-of-two's phone with text messages revealing a series recent of drug deals he had organised, according to The Gympie Times.

The arrest was not Grimstone's first run-in with law - with the court hearing he had previously been sentenced for an escapade in which he stole a horse from the Gympie Showgrounds in 2019 

The wanted man had given him $100 for 0.5 grams of methamphetamine in January 2020 and then repeated the same deal later that month. 

Grimstone also sold 0.2 grams of meth to another person at the end of January. 

The arrest was not Grimstone's first run-in with law - with the court hearing he had previously been sentenced for an escapade in which he stole a horse from the Gympie Showgrounds in 2019. 

After hightailing through town he rode the steed into the Jockey Club Hotel before punching a customer in the face when he was not looking. 

The victim suffered multiple facial fractures and a broken tooth. 

Grimstone was on parole for those offences when he was charged with the drug offences. 

Appearing in Gympie District Court this week, he pleaded guilty to three charges of supplying schedule one drugs. 

Grimstone has two children - one to a former partner and one to his current girlfriend - and worked on andoff as a concreter, the court was told. 

He had spent 83 days in jail over the drug charges before being granted bail on April 27. 

He was handed a 12 month suspended sentence for one drug charge with the other penalties to be served concurrently.
