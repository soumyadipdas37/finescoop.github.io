Rehearsals for Dancing With The Stars season 29 are in full swing as the series premiere is only two days away. 

And stars were seen arriving for another long day of practice in Los Angeles on Saturday. 

Selling Sunset's Chrishell Stause, former Backstreet Boy AJ McLean and The Bachelorette's Kaitlyn Bristowe all seemed ready to move.

But fellow competitor Anne Heche, 51, looked like she may have had a setback as she appeared to be the first DWTS contestant of this season to be injured.

Despite the small setback, Anne looked in good spirits for her day of dancing in an oversized hat and furry vest, that she layered over a pair of bright purple sweatpants and a black top.
