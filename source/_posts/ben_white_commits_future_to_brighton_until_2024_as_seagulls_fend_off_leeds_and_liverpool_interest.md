Brighton have secured the long-term future of centre back Ben White until the summer of 2024.

White had attracted heavy interest from Leeds - where he shone last season on loan - and Premier League champions Liverpool but Brighton have been quick to tie him down to a new four-year contract.

The Seagulls announced the news on Tuesday afternoon and manager Graham Potter spoke of his delight at sealing his long-term future.

Brighton have tied down centre back Ben White to a new four-year contract until June 2024

Potter told Brighton's official website: 'I have been looking forward to working with Ben for a long time. He was a player I was well aware of, even before I came to the club. 

'He has gradually stepped up the EFL divisions, with Newport County, Peterborough United and Leeds United.

'He had a brilliant season helping Leeds to the title last season, and now he has the opportunity to show his qualities in the Premier League.

'We are delighted to have agreed a new long-term contract with him, and I am sure our supporters will be looking forward to watching him play for the club.'
