Gold Coast residents have been warned hard-partying Year 12 students will ignore the ban on Schoolies and continue the traditional week-long party. 

The event is held over a three-week period and typically has dates for both Queensland and interstate Schoolies trips from November to December.

Schoolies 2020 was set to take place between November 21 to December 12 but was cancelled by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk over COVID-19 fears. 

But experts said school-leavers would still be attending and encouraged property owners to finalise their coronavirus safety plans, realestate.com.au reported.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (pictured above) cancelled all events and parties associated with schoolies because of COVID-19 fears in August 

Body corporate expert Sarah Pearson, from Stratacare on the Gold Coast, said property owners would be faced with additional challenges at this year's Schoolies.  

'Owners and building managers need to make definitive plans and take adequate steps to mitigate against the additional risks,' she explained.      

The Queensland premier cancelled all Schoolies events, such as beachfront concerts, in August to avoid 'contracting or spreading COVID-19'. 

'The pandemic means we cannot have mass gatherings. Parents need to know their children's safety comes first,' Ms Palaszczuk explained. 

Ms Pearson said the lack of events would encourage school leavers to remain indoors and increase safety risks inside any Gold Coast accomodations.      

'This will exacerbate all the usual risks associated with Schoolies like balcony safety, underage drinking, drugs, noise and property damage,' she explained. 

Ms Pearson also said there would be demand for 'tighter and robust security' as well as stricter hygiene measures.

Owners and building managers have been encouraged to adopt a 'zero-tolerance policy' in regards to any rule breaking (a group of school-leavers pictured on the Gold Coast)

'This should include strategies to enforce social distancing, increasing cleaning and hygiene requirements and contact tracing protocols.'   

Queensland accommodation providers will be required to register all guests as part of their COVID-safe plans.

The Queensland government have also limited gatherings in residences to no more than 10 people during the Schoolies dates.  

Ms Pearson encouraged property owners to develop a clear COVID-19 plan with rules and consequences before the beginning of Schoolies. 

She said a 'zero-tolerance policy' should be implemented for any rule breaking or flouting of coronavirus restrictions. 

Ms Pearson said Schoolies would provide a 'much-needed financial windfall' after the Gold Coast suffered through a lack of tourism during the coronavirus pandemic.
