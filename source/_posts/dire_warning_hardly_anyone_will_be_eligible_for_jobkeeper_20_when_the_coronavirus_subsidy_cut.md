Experts are warning 'hardly anyone' will be eligible for JobKeeper 2.0 when the coronavirus subsidy is slashed next week following a six-month extension. 

From September 28, payments for full-time staff are being cut from $1,500 to $1,200 per fortnight, while people who usually worked less than 20 hours a week before the pandemic will receive just $750.

More than one million workers are expected to come off JobKeeper over the next three months as businesses recover.

But accountant Ben Johnston Johnston Advisory warned 'hardly anyone will be eligible' to claim the subsidy due to sweeping new criteria.

'The numbers speak for themselves – I reckon only about a third of current JobKeeper recipients will be eligible come October,' Mr Johnston told news.com.au.

'So many more businesses will be left to fend for themselves. There has been an artificial influx (of money) into the economy, and once that is taken away, it will be really telling to see if businesses can survive on their own two feet.'

Mr Johnston said the changes were a 'ticking time bomb' and claimed the government is tightening JobKeeper eligibility too soon.

'It should have remained at least through the Christmas trading period, when having more money flowing through the economy would have boosted retail sales as well,' he said.

Almost 3.6 million people have received the fortnightly payments throughout the pandemic.

That number is expected to drop to 2.24 million in the December quarter as businesses whose turnovers have improved 'graduate' from the scheme.

It is tipped to tumble to 1.75 million in the first three months of next year.

The Morrison government is also preparing to slash JobSeeker booster payments from the end of this week.

People on the unemployment benefit have since March received an extra $550 per fortnight through a coronavirus supplement.

That is being reduced to $250 a fortnight from this Friday and is scheduled to be scrapped altogether at the end of December.

Senator Ruston said the increased dole payment would be extended into next year if required.

JobKeeper recipients on $1,200 per fortnight may be eligible for a partial dole payment, lifting their total income to $1476

'I want to assure all Australians, if elevated supports are continued to be needed, they will be made available,' she told reporters.

Anyone anxious about having their JobKeeper payment slashed is being told to apply for the dole.

Social Services Minister Anne Ruston is encouraging people to top up their payments with unemployment benefits.

'We have temporarily put arrangements in place so that our social security safety net is not just for people who have lost their jobs,' Senator Ruston said on Monday.

'It is able to provide a cushion for people who have had or fear their hours or income will be reduced.'

JobKeeper recipients on $1,200 per fortnight may be eligible for a partial dole payment, lifting their total income to $1476.

People receiving JobKeeper at the part-time rate of $750 per fortnight could receive another $546 in unemployment benefits, boosting their incomes to $1295.
