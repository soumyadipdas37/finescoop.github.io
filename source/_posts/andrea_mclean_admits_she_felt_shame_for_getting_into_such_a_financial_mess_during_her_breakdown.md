Andrea McLean reveals she felt 'shame' at getting herself into 'such a financial mess' during her mental breakdown. 

Last year, the mother-of-two had a secret breakdown which she revealed today was sparked by traumatic memories which returned to her while taking part on  the celebrity edition SAS: Who Dares Wins. 

Speaking on today's Loose Women, the Glasgow-born presenter, 50, admitted that she 'took her eye off the ball financially' while she was struggling with her mental health, but was too ashamed to tell anyone.   

She added that while she used to be 'afraid' to speak her mind, she's no longer accepting things she isn't happy with, and will stop putting 'everyone else's needs first'.

Last year, the mother-of-two had a secret breakdown which she revealed today was sparked by traumatic memories which returned to her while taking part on the celebrity edition SAS: Who Dares Wins

When asked why she hadn't spoken about her financial breakdown sooner, she said: Shame. The main thing was shame.

'I really thought about putting this in the book, I thought I cannot write about piecing your life back together, without literally laying it all out on the table, and one of those things was that I took my eye off the ball financially while my head was in a bad space. 

Andrea has previously spoken about how her breakdown was triggered by years of being a 'people pleaser', but today explained that she's done with 'taking the short end of the stick'. 

'As women, we slip back into our old patterns there is a comfort in our discomfort , said Andrea. 'But the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result.

'I know that sometimes I come across as Mrs Stepford wife and I'm not doing that anymore, smiling and taking the short end of the stick.' 

She stressed that she no longer fears other people's opinions of her, and is not afraid to speak her mind.  

'I'm speaking out', she said. 'I was afraid before. The repercussions were terrifying in some cases, but in others I didn't want people to not like me.

'I'm not scared anymore. I say now, I'll say i'm not happy or I'm starting to feel a bit strange and I need to back off. We tend to put everyone else's needs first and that is ridiculous.'

Explaining what triggered her breakdown, Andrea explained that during her stint on SAS: Who Dares Wins, she felt as though her 'mask' was being 'ripped off'. 

'What came back was some really traumatic things in my life,' told Andrea. 'I had buried them and we think it's dealt with, but when I did that I had opened the box and couldn't get them back in again.' 

Andrea took a six-week break from Loose Women after suffering a breakdown, but did not reveal the extent of her struggles until May of this year.

The star has since spent a majority of lockdown writing a tell-all book about her struggles titled This Girl Is On Fire'.

Speaking in an episode of Loose Women earlier this month, she said: 'Last year I had a breakdown. I also spent much of the following year and much of the lockdown writing about that breakdown.

'What that's like, it's like poking a wound. The book that I've written is the most honest and raw book I have ever written.

'[It incorporates] the reasons why [I had a breakdown]... It talks about domestic abuse, which I have never opened up about before, it talks about mental unwellness, and getting to that breaking point when you can't take anymore.'
