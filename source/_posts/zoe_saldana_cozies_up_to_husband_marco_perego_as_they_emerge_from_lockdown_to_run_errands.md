Zoe Saldana could be seen getting close to her dashing husband Marco Perego while out in Los Angeles this weekend.

The 42-year-old franchise superstar was California Casual in a tan Adidas T-shirt dress as she loaded up on groceries.

Sweeping her hair into a ponytail, she made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask and even chose one that matched her dress.

Meanwhile Marco swept his own hair up into a bun, showing off his toned arms in a pale yellow T-shirt that complemented his loose-fitted white trousers. 

The Italian filmmaker, who took Zoe's last name when they married, warded off the California rays with a sleek pair of shades. 

Their grocery haul included produce as well as a box of La Croix, a brand of sparkling water that has rocketed in popularity in recent years.

Zoe and Marco married in London in 2013 and have since welcomed three sons - three-year-old Zen and five-year-old twins Bowie and Cy.

In early April after the coronavirus lockdowns began she shared an Instagram video of Marco and their boys in the backyard and reflected on bringing up sons.

'It’s fun as hell, at all times- every waking minute of your day is spent trying to talk someone from beating someone else, or burning the house down, or flashing a neighbor, or smelling someone else’s butt,' she quipped.

'I swear I’m not feeling sorry for my husband and I, it’s just that being stuck at home with these cubs makes me appreciate work!' Zoe said gamely.

About a year ago Zoe and Marco co-starred in the music video for Alicia Keys and Miguel's number Show Me The Love.

When Alicia dropped her self-titled new album this Friday Zoe made sure to show her support by promoting it on her Instagram.

'My sister’s album is out now! I’ll be blasting it all weekend until I memorize every note, every word and every message,' wrote Zoe.

'I’m proud of you @aliciakeys . I feel blessed to have you as a mentor and friend!' gushed the Guardians Of The Galaxy star.
