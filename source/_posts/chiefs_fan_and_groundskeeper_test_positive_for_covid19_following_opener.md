Although Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans players have all been cleared for coronavirus, one fan and a groundskeeper at Arrowheads Stadium for last week's NFL opener have tested positive, prompting Missouri health officials to request that 10 more attendees quarantine.

Just 17,000 fans were allowed to attend the game, due to pandemic concerns.  

State health officials claim that one person who watched the game from a group box tested positive the following day. Those who were near that unidentified individual have been notified and did agree to quarantine themselves.

Kansas City and Jacksonville were the only two NFL teams to allow fan attendance in Week 1.

Two NFL players were among the seven new positive COVID-19 tests recorded from September 6-12, the league and the union announced Wednesday.

A total of 40,479 tests were administered to 7,437 players and team personnel.

That breaks down to 15,959 tests to 2,511 players and 24,520 tests to 4,926 personnel.

'There were two new confirmed positive tests among players and five new confirmed positives among other personnel,' the NFL and NFL Players Association said in a memo.

Players and Tier 1 and 2 personnel were tested daily. Tier 3 individuals were tested weekly.

Individuals who test positive for the coronavirus must follow the joint NFL-NFLPA Treatment Protocol.

They are immediately isolated and not permitted access to club facilities or to have direct contact with other players or personnel. Club medical staff are in regular communication with those who test positive to monitor symptoms.
