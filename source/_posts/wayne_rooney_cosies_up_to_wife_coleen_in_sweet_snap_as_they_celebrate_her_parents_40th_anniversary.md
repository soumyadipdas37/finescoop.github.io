Their outing came amid claims the sportsman joked' about their 'lack of sex life' at a Soccer Aid party, with the remark quickly becoming 'the talk of the event'. 

The former Manchester United ace had reportedly arrived late at the event to celebrate the UNICEF match and was 'drinking red wine' when he made the remark. 

A TV runner was believed to have 'chatted' to the player-coach for Championship club Derby County, when she overheard him joke that 'he had not had sex for ages'.

A source told The Sun how the socially-distanced gathering at Mottram Hall hotel, Cheshire, 'was in full swing' when Wayne, who married childhood sweetheart Coleen in 2008, arrived.

They told the publication: 'He was very relaxed. One of the runners chatted to him and then went around saying she heard Wayne say he had not had sex for ages.'

The source added: 'She said she was unsure if he was joking or not but he probably was.'

The sister of Manchester United captain Harry Maguire, Daisy, 20, was believed to be 'among a group where some people heard it' with the event hosting around 70 people. 

The highly popular match saw team Wayne's England lose out after team Rest of the World beat them on penalties at Old Trafford earlier this month. MailOnline has contacted Wayne's representatives for comment. 

On the legal front, Coleen is set to go to court against Rebekah Vardy, 37, who she accused of leaking stories about her to the media in October - a claim she fiercely denies.
