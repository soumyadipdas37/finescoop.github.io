There's also a quick clip of Harlow having an encounter with an alligator that was swimming in one of the waterways on the course.

She could be heard declaring: 'Don't look at me,' as the reptile turned its course and began heading her way.

'No, don't be swimming over here,' she added, before scurrying farther from the waters edge as she added, 'No, no, no.' 

After the brief, but still harmless encounter, Harlow sat back and watched Kumza show off his golf game. 

By the time nightfall began to settle in, Harlow took another snap of the Laker power forward with the headline: 'What a day.'
