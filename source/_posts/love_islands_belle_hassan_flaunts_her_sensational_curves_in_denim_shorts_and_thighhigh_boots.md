She shot to fame after entering the Love Island villa in 2018.

And Belle Hassan looked sensational as she stepped out to enjoy a lunch date with a pal at Sexy Fish in London's Mayfair on Sunday. 

The reality star, 22, flaunted her curves in a pair of denim shorts which she paired with some thigh-high black suede boots.

Belle put on a stylish display in a tight black top which highlighted her ample assets by scooping slightly across the chest.

Adding another layer to her look, Belle wore a checked shirt over her forearms and let the back hang over her shorts.

Not forgetting her accessories, Belle added a selection of chic gold necklaces and toted a large black handbag. 

The blonde beauty wore her tresses down and wavy for the outing before adding a full face of makeup including a slick of nude lipstick to accentuate her features.

Belle left Love Island in a couple with Anton Danyluk, 24, but the pair split just five weeks after exiting the villa. 

Since then Belle has been linked to Absolutely Ascot's Rudi Hewitt with the pair being spotted on a date in August, reports the Sun.

However the blonde beauty hasn't made the rumoured romance Instagram official, instead opting to share sizzling selfies and sexy lingerie shots. 

Her ex Anton spoke to MailOnline after their split about why he has ruled out reuniting and said that it would be like dating his 'sister'.

Speaking about whether there might be  any romantic reunion between the pair in the future, he said: 'No, definitely not, it's just not that type of relationship. 

'We're so friendly now, it would be like dating your sister, effectively. It's not that kind of relationship anymore.'

But the pair have kept in contact since their time on the reality TV show ended and there doesn't seem to be any hard feelings between them.

Anton added:  'Me and Belle have stayed good friends. We were in a stage there where we were talking every single day.

'We went through a mad experience in there which I will never experience with anyone else in my life. I have a lot of love and a lot of respect for her and that will never change.'
