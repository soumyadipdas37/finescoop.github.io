She dated Blake Griffin from the summer of 2017 until their breakup in the spring of 2018.

And Kendall Jenner nearly endured an awkward run in with the 31-year-old NBA star, while arriving to Nobu with new beau Devin Booker, 23, on Saturday.

Kendall's younger sister Kylie Jenner, 23, joined the loved up pair at the popular restaurant.

Blake, who plays for the Detroit Pistons, did not appear to interact with Kendall as he swiftly left Nobu with his crew. 

Kendall, 24, put on a leggy display in a silk mini dress that featured a black speckled pattern and spaghetti straps.

Her brunette hair was parted down the middle and styled into a chic messy bun and she wore a pair of black shades over her eyes and a face mask over her mouth and nose.

Devin kept extra casual for the early dinner with his lady by rocking a white tee, a pair of shorts, and a beige face mask. He also had on a pair of stylish shades.

The couple, who reportedly began dating earlier this year, have recently gone public with their romance, often hitting up popular restaurants together.

Earlier this week, they ventured to Idaho with pop star Justin Bieber, 26, and his wife Hailey, 23, who happens to be Kendall's longtime best friend.  

In June, Kendall and Devin were seen getting into the same SUV as they left a dinner date at Nobu. Prior to this they allegedly embarked on a road trip to Arizona in April.

Jenner refused to directly name Griffin because she 'likes to keep [her] private life private.'

But she did reveal to the magazine that the person she was dating happened to be 'very nice' and that she was 'happy.' 

She added: 'I have someone being very nice to me.'

Though neither of them spoke publicly about their breakup, it was alleged that Griffin's trade from the LA Clippers to the Detroit Pistons had a hand in their split.
