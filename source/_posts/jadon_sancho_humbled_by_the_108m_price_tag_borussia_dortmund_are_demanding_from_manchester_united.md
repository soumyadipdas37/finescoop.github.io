Jadon Sancho has revealed he is humbled by his £108m price tag as the Borussia Dortmund star insisted that it is important he must remain patient during his career. 

The 20-year-old has been identified as Manchester United's No 1 transfer target this summer, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer eager to bring the youngster in to bolster his attacking ranks.

Last month, Dortmund said that the Old Trafford club missed a set deadline to agree a deal for the star, who the Germans value at £108m, and a drastic breakthrough is needed if United want to land their man.

The Borussia Dortmund star has been heavily linked with a move to Man United this summer

And Sancho, who joined the Bundesliga side from Manchester City for £8m in 2017, says he is humbled by the hefty price tag Dortmund have placed on him.   

'I guess it’s a nice feeling to be worth so much, but again, I don’t really look at it that much,' he told SoccerBible. 'For me it’s about doing well for my team and doing well for myself as well.'

The 20-year-old took a big risk to walk away from City as a teenager, opting not to stay in the academy and the opportunity to develop under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola. Sancho insists, though, that it is important to be patient.  

Negotiations between the two clubs have been prolonged with a big breakthrough needed

Sancho added that it is important that he remains patient at this early stage of his career

'I feel like everything is a process,' he added. 'So you’ve got to be patient in what you do. Obviously I took a massive risk coming to Germany. I had a lot of people doubting me saying why are you leaving City, but I just felt like it was the right time for me.

'It’s about patience. You can’t rush things. Everything happens for a reason. If it was meant to be this year that I broke through, then I’d be more than happy. I’m still young at the end of the day.

'But obviously I was lucky enough that I had the coaches that had faith in me, and they took a chance. The last few years have gone so quick for me and I’m enjoying the journey.

'For me, I just focus on my football. I just want to do what’s best for my team and win titles at the end of the day.'

United have trailed Sancho all summer but are making little progress in talks surrounding the agent fee for brokering a move and the player's salary.

Discussions between the two parties are ongoing, albeit slowly, and United will not negotiate a fee with Borussia Dortmund until a deal has been reached with the 20-year-old's representatives.
