Brigitte Nielsen has paid tribute to her former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone, who passed away at the age of 98 on Monday.

The model, 57, who was married to the late star's son Sylvester from 1985 until 1987, had bonded with the astrologer during their joint stint on Celebrity Big Brother in 2005, 18 years after her divorce from the Rocky legend, 74.

In a heartbreaking post shared to Instagram on Tuesday, the actress admitted she felt emotional as she 'didn't get to say goodbye', but praised the icon for being 'extremely strong'.

The media personality uploaded a beaming snap of the pair enjoying dinner at the Ivy in Los Angeles back in November 2018.

Danish screen star Brigitte wrote in an accompanying post: 'Extremely strong, full of energy and very unique woman under so many aspects, till the very end. 

'Emotions are running through me all because now you're gone and I didn't get to say goodbye. You'll be surely missed. Rest in Peace dear Jackie.' (sic)

Jackie had an iconic run-in with Brigitte during her brief but memorable time on the UK reality show.

From the first moment she stepped through the door, in a fur coat and uttering the immortal words: ‘Yeah, Jackie’ she became a fan favourite.

The former dancer demanded a tipple with every meal, having apparently never eaten a meal without a fine wine and confessed she had never seen the show before prompting plenty of confusing Diary Room moments. Despite only lasting four days in the house, she remains a part of BB history.

After calling it quits from Sylvester, Brigitte went onto marry photographer Sebastian Copeland from 1990 until 1992 and actor Raoul Meyer from 1993 until 2005, before settling down with Italian producer Mattia Dessì in 2006.

In May 1997, Award-winning thespian married Sylvester, meanwhile, tied the knot to model Jennifer Flavin in 1997.

Frank provided some impressive details regarding his mother's life, including that she 'lived through prohibition, the depression and World War II.' 

'I would talk to her for hours about the 20's 30's and 40's. It was a history lesson. Her mind was as sharp as a razor till the day she died.

'She never wore a mask a true revolutionary gal. I guess I'm drowning my emotions in tears and to much vino. But when you've known someone for 70 yrs it tough and sad.'

Celebrity Big Brother 2005

Jackie had an iconic run-in with former daughter-in-law Brigitte Nielsen during her brief but memorable time on the UK reality show. 

From the first moment she stepped through the door, in a fur coat and uttering the immortal words: ‘Yeah, Jackie’ she became a fan favourite.

She demanded a tipple with every meal, having apparently never eaten a meal without a fine wine and confessed she had never seen the show before prompting plenty of confusing Diary Room moments.

Despite only lasting four days in the house, she remains a part of BB history.

 

Fitness icon 

Jackie became 'the first woman to have a daily TV show on exercise and weight lifting in Washington, D.C,' which led to her opening her own all-female gym called Barbella's.

Up until her death, Jackie could be seen engaging in weight lifting exercises, which she often filmed and uploaded to her Instagram page. 

  

GLOW girl 

The star was one of the key creators and trainers on G.L.O.W., The Gorgeous Girls of Wrestling, a syndicated TV show from Las Vegas that ran for five years in the 1980s.

The show was adapted into a Netflix drama in recent years.

 

Reading the stars for the stars 

Jackie's biggest passion was astrology, which she studied for 15-years under the supervision of a plethora of acclaimed astrologers. 

On her website, she wrote that she has advised 'kings, prime ministers, politicians, movie stars, gamblers, generals, gangsters, cops and priests' during her career as an astrologist, while she is also credited with coining the phrase and practice of 'rumpology,' which was described as similar to palm reading, but of one's bottom.







Frank informed his following that Jackie 'had seven grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren' and that his older brother Sylvester 'took care of her like a Queen for all of her life.'

'I will never be able to call my mom again or have her yell at me why I never got married . But we all loved her and her sprit to survive and prevail . I'll miss you always mommy. @officialslystallone,' he concluded.   

Jackie also leaves behind husband of over two-decades Stephen Marcus Levine. She shares Sylvester and Frank with late ex husband Frank Stallone Sr. 

The former women's wrestling promoter is also mother to late actress Toni D'Alto, who passed away at the age of 48 after a lengthy cancer battle in 2012. She shared Toni with ex husband Anthony Filiti.
