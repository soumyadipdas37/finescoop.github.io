French Champagne, German cars and Irish beef could all be hit with tariffs by the UK if the EU triggers a trade war amid growing Brexit tensions, it was claimed today. 

The Government is said to be looking at how it could respond if Brussels tries to punish Britain. 

Relations between the two sides have sunk to a new low after Boris Johnson unveiled his plans to override parts of the Brexit divorce deal. 

The EU has given the Prime Minister until the end of the month to withdraw the plans or face legal action and the potential collapse of trade talks.

Boris Johnson's plans to override parts of of the Brexit divorce deal have sparked EU fury

But the Government has insisted it will not be backtracking, putting the two sides on a collision course and sparking fears of revenge. 

A Whitehall source told the Sunday Express that 'a trade war is a concern' and ministers are 'considering all options'.

It is thought a tit-for-tat plan could see the UK target flagship EU exports like German car manufacturers, French wine producers and Irish beef. 

However, such measures would apparently only be taken by the UK if the EU was to strike first. 

Tory Brexiteers are increasingly of the belief that Brussels could try to punish Britain over Mr Johnson's attempts to tear up parts of the Withdrawal Agreement. 

Some are even pushing for the Government to axe the treaty entirely, with one Tory MP saying: 'The problem is that we have seen the EU can misuse the Withdrawal Agreement and at the moment it still stands if we walk away from trade talks.' 

Michel Barnier last week appeared to hint that the EU could ban UK food exports to the bloc if no trade deal is agreed by the end of the transition period in December.     

The EU's top negotiator said there were still 'many uncertainties' on the UK's post-Brexit standards regime and that 'more clarity is needed' in order for Brussels to agree to allow British exports of food and livestock to continue.

Mr Barnier today rejected claims that the EU could block UK food exports to the bloc if the two sides fail to strike a trade deal by the end of the year 

The comments were seen by many in Westminster as a threat that UK exports could be impeded.  

But Mr Barnier today dismissed the claims as he tweeted: ‘Sticking to facts is also essential. A case in point: EU is not refusing to list UK as a third country for food imports.

‘To be listed, we need to know in full what a country’s rules are, incl for imports. The same objective process applies to all listed countries.’ 

However, his British counterpart Lord Frost challenged Mr Barnier as the pair became embroiled in an extraordinary Twitter row. 

Lord Frost claimed the EU had 'said to us explicitly' during trade talks that if Brussels does not formally recognise the UK's post-Brexit food standards regime then 'we will not be able to move food to Northern Ireland'.
