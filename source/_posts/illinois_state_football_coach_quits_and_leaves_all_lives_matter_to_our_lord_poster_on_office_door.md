The coach of Illinois State football has quit, leaving a poster on the door of his office which read: 'All Lives Matter to Our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ'.

Kurt Beathard, member of a celebrated NFL dynasty, left his position as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the college team on Wednesday.

On Thursday, he told his local newspaper in Bloomington, Illinois - The Pantagraph - that he had put the sign on his door before his departure.

He refused to discuss the circumstances surrounding his departure. 

Kurt Beathard has left his job as a coach for Illinois State football team

Prior to his departure, Beathard left a sign on his door reading: 'All lives matter to our Lord'

In the weeks leading up to his abrupt leave-taking, a Black Lives Matter poster which was in the team's locker room was removed. Beathard insisted he had nothing to do with its removal.

At the end of August, Beathard's former colleague Larry Lyons, director of athletics, caused controversy among Redbirds - the athletic teams that represent Illinois State University - by telling students: 'All Redbird lives matter'. 

Some college athletes based at the Normal, Illinois center temporarily boycotted team meetings, workouts and practices as a result.

An Athletics March for Black Voices was held on September 4. 

ISU announced in a Wednesday afternoon press release that Beathard was being replaced by Ghaali Muhammad-Lankford and C.J. Irvin, who would both serve as co-offensive coordinators. 

Andy Belluomini has been added to the ISU coaching staff to assume the quarterbacks coach position previously held by Beathard.

Beathard spent the 2014 and '15 seasons as the Redbird offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach before taking two years off to spend more time with his family. 

Beathard coached the team in 2014 and 2015; took a break; then returned for 2018 onwards

He came back to ISU in the same roles in 2018.

Beathard is a member of a remarkable footballing family.

His nephew, CJ Beathard, is a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers, and his uncle, Pete Beathard, played professionally from 1964-75. 

Beathard's father Bobby Beathard, now 83, was a general manager for the NFL.

As a player, Beathard Sr's teams competed in seven Super Bowls, winning four times.

He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018.
