Despite retiring from tennis at the young age of 21-years-old, Anna Kournikova reached number eight in world rankings. 

And it seems the Russian-born athlete is already preparing her seven-month-old daughter Masha to take up the sport. 

In an adorable snap of her youngest child, posted to Instagram on Wednesday, Kournikova joked that she was headed to Wimbledon.

Masha beamed a bright and wide-eyes smile as she sat on a plush white couch. 

'Wimbledon, here I come,' her mother, 39, captioned the snap alongside a heart eyes emoji and 19 tennis balls emojis. 

The daughter of Kournikova and her partner of nearly 20-years Enrique Iglesias wore a darling white ensemble of white dress, with a button-up polo vest-style top and eyelet lace fringe skirt. 

Kournikova started playing tennis in 1995 and has not played in a WTA tournament since 2003. She peaked at number eight in the world rankings and amassed more than $3.5m in prize earnings.

The former tennis pro and singer are notably private about their family and life in Miami, but since welcoming Masha have shared more photos of their growing family.  

The couple welcomed their third child back on January 30, after welcoming twins Nicholas and Lucy in December 2017.  

Earlier this year, Iglesias has posted a cute video to his social media accounts in which he is holding baby Masha and making her dance for the camera. The singer, 45, captioned the clip with a simple heart emoji. 

Masha - a Russian diminutive for the name Mary - sat in her daddy's lap as he moved her hands around in time with the music. She wore a cute little navy dress with red and green striping.

Iglesias and Kournikova  have been together since 2001. Despite no reports of them marrying, with him last confirming they had not wed in 2018, Kournikova added Igelesias to her name on Instagram. 

Enrique told People on March 4 that the transition for the twins with a new sibling has gone 'very smoothly,' adding that 'they actually love it.'

He explained: 'There's a two year difference, so I was a little scared. I was like, 'How are they going to react?' And I have two dogs so my house is chaotic.'

Adding: 'When we first came home with Masha, I was like, 'Oh, how is everybody going to react?''

Iglesias also told Entertainment Tonight earlier this year he is happy to change diapers and give bottles to the baby.

'I actually am. I'm pretty hands on,' he said.

He added that he hopes his kids follow in the footsteps of their tennis player mother, rather than opting for a music career like his own. 

'I can honestly tell you, if I had to pick one, definitely sports,' he explained. 'Yeah, I would say yes, just because I love sports. I love golf, I love tennis, and I would not mind seeing one of my little girls play tennis.'

'I don't want to become one of these obsessive fathers, but I told Anna, I said, 'You can be the best coach in the world.'' 

The Hero singer previously admitted he hopes he's a 'cool' dad but also felt he'd developed a new sense of responsibility since welcoming his twins into the world.

He said: 'It's one of the best feelings in the world. [I'm more responsible]. I drive slower. I think about stupid things a few more times before doing them.

Adding: 'I hope to be a cool, easy-going dad.'
