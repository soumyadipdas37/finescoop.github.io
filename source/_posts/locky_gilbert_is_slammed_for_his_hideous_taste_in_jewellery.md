Viewers ruthlessly slammed Locky Gilbert's choice of ring in The Bachelor grand finale on Thursday. 

After breaking Bella Veralis' heart, Locky declared his love for Irena Srbinovska and gifted her with a ring to remember the special occasion.

The ring appeared to be adorned by a purple gem and was flanked by marquise-shaped jewels.

'That's one ugly ring': Locky Gilbert is slammed for his 'hideous' taste in jewellery for his winning lady Irena Srbinovska... while others suggest the purple jewel was meant for dumped Bella Veralis

Avid fans of the show flocked to Twitter to mock Locky's taste, including one who said: 'That's one ugly ring... but like Locky's tattoos.' 

'What in the gumball machine plastic ring is that?!' wrote another.

Meanwhile, another joked: 'Only Locky would just bung a ring of that calibre in his pocket. When he proposes he will probably chuck the ring at her head while she cruises the block on a scooter in Bali.'  





Unimpressed: Avid fans of the show flocked to Twitter to mock Locky's taste, including one who said, 'That's one ugly ring... but like Locky's tattoos.' 

Fans also compared Locky's ring to 2015 Bachelor Sam Wood's infamous 'cheezel ring' for his now-wife Snezana. 

'I hate this ring almost as much as the cheezel ring,' they wrote.  

'Sorry, but that ring is f***ing hideous and the worst Bachelor ring ever and yes, I do remember the cheezel ring,' echoed another.

However, there were viewers who actually liked the ring, including one who said: 'Definitely not the ugliest ring we've seen on this show.'

Meanwhile, other fans couldn't help but notice that the purple ring appeared to match Bella's dress and floral arrangement.

One tweeted: 'The backdrop AND the ring matched Bella's dress, why do I feel like he changed his mind last minute?'

'The ring is purple, the setting is purple, and so is Bella's dress. Go figure,' another write before a third chipped in: 'Does that ring match Bella's dress or what?'  

Not that bad: But there were viewers who actually liked the ring, including one who said: 'Definitely not the ugliest ring we've seen on this show'







Sneaking suspicion: Meanwhile, other fans couldn't help but notice that the purple ring appeared to match Bella's dress and floral arrangement.

In the end, Locky chose to end things with Bella to pursue a relationship with Irena.

He told her: 'When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.'

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'
