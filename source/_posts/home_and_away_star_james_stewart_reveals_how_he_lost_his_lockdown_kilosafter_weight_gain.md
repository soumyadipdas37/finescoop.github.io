Like most Australians, James Stewart has spent much of the year in lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

And the 44-year-old actor says it played havoc on his waist line, with his weight ballooning to 104 kilos just weeks into Sydney's quarantine restrictions. 

The Home and Away star told The Daily Telegraph on Saturday: 'To be honest, I went from 95kg to 104kg within the first six weeks of iso.'

'My favourite snacks were chicken burgers and kebabs. I would find comfort in a bowl of ice-cream every day, and a glass or two of wine every other day.'

The star says that he eventually decided enough is enough when his lifestyle began affecting his family. 

'My turning point was when my wife, Sarah, could tell I was waking up heavier and without my usual zest for life,' he told the paper.

'And also, my daughter Scout was starting to follow me down the path of bad eating habits and not doing a lot of exercise,' he added. 

To get back in shape, James made a list of foods he can and cannot eat, based on advice from a nutritionist and made sure to exercise once a day. 

He also felt motivated by his family, reminding himself he was doing it for them - but stressed that a cheat day was necessary and not all the snacks have to go.

James' wife is fellow Home and Away star Sarah Roberts, 35.

Sarah and James tied the knot at Luttrellstown Castle on the outskirts of Dublin, Ireland last year.  

The couple recently revealed details from their big day in an interview with Now To Love.   

'It was really special. We got married in a castle, I think that's a dream come true,' Sarah told the publication.

'And we had all of our close friends and relatives around so I don't think I could've wished for anything more'.   

James revealed his daughter Scout, eight, who he shares with ex-partner Jessica Marais, loved the wedding as much as her dad and stepmother did. 

'She loved it. She met her new cousins, she got makeup on, she put on a pretty dress. Some of the photos I've seen of her are pretty special,' James said.
