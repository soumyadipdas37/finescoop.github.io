Tiahleigh Palmer's foster father and killer has been found unresponsive in his jail cell. 

Rick Thorburn was sentenced to life behind bars for murdering the 12-year-old and dumping her body into a river on the Gold Coast in 2015. 

Thorburn was reportedly found unconscious in his cell at Wolston Prison, Brisbane, on Saturday. 

The convicted child killer was taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital in a critical condition.

There have been previous concerns with authorities that Thorburn could self-harm.   

'Queensland Corrective Services can confirm that a prisoner was transported by QAS to the Princess Alexandra Hospital after being found unresponsive in their single occupancy cell at Wolston Correctional Centre at unlock yesterday morning,' a QCS spokeswoman said.

'The prisoner remains in hospital at this time.' 

Thorburn killed Tiahleigh between 8pm and 10pm October 29, 2015, hours after his son Trent, who was 18 at the time, confessed to having raped her - telling his parents he feared she was pregnant. 

Tiahleigh's mother Cindy Palmer told 60 Minutes she 'fell to the ground crying' when she was told her daughter was dead.

'Obviously it was my daughter and she was found washed up in a river. What kind of animal leaves a girl in a river?'
