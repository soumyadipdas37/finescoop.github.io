Curtis Stone was forced to shut down both his Los Angeles restaurants in April, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

And it appears, the celebrity chef, 44, is now focused on promoting his frozen steak burgers.

On Monday, Curtis flogged his Aussie grass fed steak burgers in a bizarre infomercial on an American TV channel.

'I started my career as a butcher, my dream was to open a butcher shop one day and then I began cooking and that took off,' he told viewers.

He went on to say that his burgers 'are just a good healthy piece of beef' and have 'no added hormones and no antibiotics'.

Curtis is selling 14 patties for $95 or 28 patties for $157.

The chef's TV appearance comes after he revealed the COVID-19 pandemic has been 'brutal' for his business.

Appearing on The Project in April, Curtis told Gorgi Coghlan coronavirus had forced him to shut down both of his Los Angeles restaurants.

'It is brutal. We are in Los Angeles, one of the hardest hit areas of America, and both our restaurants were closed,' he explained.

He went on to reveal that it was late one afternoon when he discovered businesses would go into a mandatory lockdown that came into effect that same night.

The Australian chef was left with no choice but to turn his restaurant, Maude, into a marketplace and deliver food to people.

'You accept it and move on, and you've just got to be flexible and keep your people taken care of and employed, and that was always our goal,' he said.

He added: 'If we can feed the community at the same time, wonderful. It's not easy. It's like starting a brand new business.'
