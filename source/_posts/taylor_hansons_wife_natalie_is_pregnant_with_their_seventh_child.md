Taylor Hanson and wife Natalie are expecting their seventh child. 

The MMMBop singer took to Instagram to share a sweet photo with his spouse, and confirmed that a new baby is due by the end of the year.  

'The best kind of unexpected,' he captioned the snap. 'Number seven coming this December. #2020.' 

Baby bliss! Taylor Hanson and wife Natalie are expecting their seventh child and announced the happy news on Instagram

Natalie sported a bright red dress as she walked hand-in-hand through a grassy field with her husband.

Taylor dressed down in a light T-shirt and jeans combo with a host of necklaces and sunglasses perched on his collar. 

On her own social media account, she wrote: 'biggest little surprise in a long time. baby number seven coming this December.

In a statement to People magazine, the singer songwriter added: 'Our family is thrilled to be welcoming a new member later this year. More than ever, we are especially grateful for this fresh wave of joy.'  

Taylor and Natalie are parents to Jordan, 17, Penelope, 15, River, 14, Viggo, 11, Wilhelmina, seven, and Claude, 21 months. 

He previously insisted, before the arrival of another baby, that he couldn't wait to add one more person to their 'tribe.'

Speaking after they found out they were expecting their sixth child, he said at the time: 'Natalie and I have always kept a love of adventure and pursuit of rich experiences at the heart of our family. There's no greater adventure than welcoming a sixth little person to our tribe.

'We'll definitely have a little bit of quiet time when the baby's born, thankfully, but the life train will continue to move quickly so we'll be excited to introduce them to this family they're entering, which is pretty much on the move all the time.' 

And seven certainly runs in the family as Taylor and his siblings Isaac and Zac — who sing together in the band Hanson — are three of seven kids.
