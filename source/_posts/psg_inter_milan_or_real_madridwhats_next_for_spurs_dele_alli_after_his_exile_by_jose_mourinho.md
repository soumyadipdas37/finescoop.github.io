Dele Alli's career is at a crossroads after being shunned by Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho for the last two matches. 

The Spurs midfielder's omission from the squad for Sunday's impressive 5-2 win at Southampton certainly raised eyebrows, just days after Alli was left out of the north Londoners' crucial Europa League win over Lokomotiv Plovdiv.

The England international midfielder has gone from one of Spurs' main men to the latest first-team star to have been ruthlessly exiled by Mourinho. 

Dele Alli has been left out of Tottenham's last two matches and his future at Spurs is in doubt

Top players such as Eden Hazard and Paul Pogba have been pushed out into the cold by the Portuguese coach and Alli appears to be the next star facing Mourinho's wrath. 

Here, Sportsmail identifies all of Alli's options ahead of a crucial end to the summer transfer window.

PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN

French champions Paris Saint-Germain are the club showing the most interest in Alli and could put in an offer for the attacking talent before the October 5 deadline. 

A move to the French capital would be an exciting option for the 24-year-old, who faces the possibility of mixing with world-class players such as Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. 

Alli's chances of winning the first trophy of his career would be significantly enhanced as well. PSG have won seven out of the last eight Ligue 1 titles, while Thomas Tuchel's side also lifted both domestic cups earlier this year and reached the Champions League final.

PSG would also benefit from the addition of Alli as the French giants look to bolster their options in attacking midfield. 

Angel di Maria has now been shifted into a wide role, Marco Verratti has suffered from long-term injury problems, while Ander Herrera and Idrissa Gueye are deemed to be more defensive options. 

Without the likes of Mbappe and Neymar, PSG look like a completely different side. The Ligue 1 champions lost their opening two matches of the league season when the attacking pair were isolating due to Covid-19.

While they have won their last two games since then, Tuchel requires more attacking options in his stellar side. Alli could fit the bill.

INTER MILAN

Inter Milan have also expressed a desire to bring in Alli before the deadline as they continue their rebuild under Antonio Conte. 

The Serie A giants are huge admirers of Premier League players having signed the likes of Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez, Victor Moses and Ashley Young over the past year. 

Another top player from England Inter have recently bought is ex-Spurs man Christian Eriksen, who arrived at the San Siro in January of this year.

Despite playing in a similar position, Alli and Eriksen formed a devastating partnership in north London under former boss Mauricio Pochettino and a reunion with the Danish midfielder could be too good to turn down for the Spurs man. 

Inter finished just one point behind champions Juventus in the Serie A table last season and Conte is determined to strengthen in order to go one better this time around.

REAL MADRID  

Alli was discussed as a potential makeweight in the deal which brought Gareth Bale back to Tottenham on loan last week.

Sportsmail exclusively revealed that the midfielder was offered to Real Madrid on loan in return for the Welshman, though the move eventually went ahead without the need to include the Spurs man. 

According to Spanish news outlet AS, Zinedine Zidane rejected the idea of Alli coming to the Santiago Bernabeu due to concerns about his character.

Zinedine Zidane dislikes Alli after comments he made when Spurs beat Madrid in 2017

The French coach is said to be angry over Alli's comments after Tottenham's 3-1 win over Madrid in the Champions League in 2017, when the Spurs star claimed he 'should have had a hat-trick' after netting twice in the group stage triumph.

Zidane was reportedly put off Alli due to those comments, explaining that his brace was not that impressive given one of his goals was a deflection and the other was offside. 

This appears to have put a potential move to the Spanish capital in serious doubt, though Madrid's 0-0 draw with Real Sociedad on Sunday night shows that the reigning LaLiga champions are in need of a creative spark.

MANCHESTER UNITED 

Of course, Alli doesn't have to move abroad to gain a fresh start in his career. Manchester United has also been earmarked as a potential destination for the England international this summer.

Certain figures behind the scenes at Old Trafford are huge admirers of the midfielder, with Mourinho revealing in Amazon Prime's All Or Nothing documentary that Sir Alex Ferguson begged him to sign Alli during his time at the club.

The Red Devils are looking for new attacking options, having failed to agree a deal with Borussia Dortmund for England winger Jadon Sancho.

However, the £40million arrival of Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek means United are well stocked in Alli's preferred position, with Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba also capable of playing there.

TOTTENHAM  

According several reports, Spurs are currently expecting Alli to stay at the club and fight for his place in Mourinho's squad.

However, the Spurs boss has been coy about the Englishman's future since he was hauled off at half-time during Tottenham's 1-0 loss to Everton on the opening weekend of the season. 

Mourinho slammed his side after the defeat, branding his players 'lazy' in their pressing of Carlo Ancelotti's men.

Those sort of comments by Mourinho have been made before, especially when talking about Alli.

The Amazon documentary showed the Portuguese coach calling the England star a 'lazy player' on his first day at the club. Perhaps Mourinho has already seen enough of the 24-year-old. 

After the victory over Southampton, the Portuguese coach would not confirm whether Alli's future will 100 per cent be in north London. 

'I want a balanced squad - that's what I want,' he said. 'He (Alli) doesn't need to be sacrificed for that but a squad is a puzzle.'

Mourinho confirmed that the midfielder will feature for the north Londoners in their Carabao Cup clash away at Leyton Orient on Tuesday night in order to stay fresh. Whether that is his last game at the club is still to be decided.
