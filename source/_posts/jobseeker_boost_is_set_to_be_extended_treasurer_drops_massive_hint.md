Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has given his strongest hint yet that the JobSeeker payment will continue to be boosted next year.

In April the government doubled the payment to $1,100 as thousands lost their jobs due to coronavirus restrictions.

The $550 boost has now decreased to $250 and is due to end at the end of December.

But Mr Fydenberg today said his government is 'leaning' towards extending the boost. 

'As a government, later this year, we'll make a decision about further support for people in JobSeeker, but we're leaning in on continuing to provide support,' he told reporters.

Social Services Minister Anne Ruston has said the government would not make a call until it could see the impact of a scheduled reduction in payments.

'We will not be making announcements in budget,' she told reporters last week.

'We don't know what Australia is going to look like on the other side of this pandemic. We don't know when it's going to end.'

'So we will remain agile and we will continue to provide the support that is needed for Australia and Australians.'

About 1.6 million Australians receive unemployment payments.

From today the supplement has been cut to $250 each fortnight.
