Regional data is different national employment figures, which fell from a 22-year high of 7.5 per cent in July to 6.8 per cent in August.

A total of 111,000 were created last month dashing fears of that unemployment would go into freefall. 

National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster said the 111,000 new jobs created last month simply reflected a surge in the number of people identifying as self employed. 

'There was a big spike in those that were basically self employed and not employing anybody,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Friday. 

The Reserve Bank of Australia said on Thursday that recessions had 'enduring effects on unemployment rates.'

'Regions that experienced larger-than-average downturns had significantly higher unemployment rates for around a decade afterwards,' it stated on its website.

RBA added 'early 1990s recession led to an even wider range of outcomes, with regional unemployment rates changing by between -5 and 13 percentage points.'

'These differences in the "initial exposure" of regions to national recessions can reflect differences in industry composition, demographics and average skill levels, among other factor.'  

Wide Bay MP Llew O'Brien told The Australian towns within his electorate had 'really serious high unemployment and really serious youth unemployment'.
