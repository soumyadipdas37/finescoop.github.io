Arsenal are already preparing a significantly improved bid for their primary target Houssem Aouar after Lyon rejected their initial offer earlier this week.

The Gunners are determined to sign the 22-year-old this summer and will reportedly raise their dismissed £32million offer to £36.5m with a further £9m in bonuses in a hope to secure the creative midfielder.

The Frenchman, who has made 130 appearances for Lyon, is paramount to Mikel Arteta's plans as he looks to deploy his team in a 4-3-3 formation this season.

Despite rejecting their opening offer, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas suggested that the club would be open to selling Aouar for the right price.

He Tweeted: 'For Houssem Arsenal is too far from his value: we are counting on him to play a great match in Lorient and lead OL in CL next year.'

The 22-year-old attacking midfielder will be vital to Mikel Arteta's 4-3-3 formation this season

Their initial £32million offer was rejected by Ligue 1 side Lyon's president earlier this week

Aouar has been previously valued at £54m but it is believed the Ligue 1 side will lower their asking price amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to football.london. 

Aouar is reportedly keen to depart the Ligue 1 club before the end of the transfer window, meaning any deal must be completed before the deadline on October 5. 

The France youth international has been successful at Lyon, registering nine goals and 10 assists in 41 club appearances during the 2019-20 season. 

The youngster also played a vital role in their run to the Champions League semi-final last season. 

Arteta will be hoping Aouar will help improve Arsenal's disappointing eighth place Premier League finish last season.
