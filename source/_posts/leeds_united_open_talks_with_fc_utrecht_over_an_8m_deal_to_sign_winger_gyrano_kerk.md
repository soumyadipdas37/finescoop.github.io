Leeds United have opened talks with FC Utrecht over an £8million deal for winger Gyrano Kerk.

The 24-year-old scored 11 goals last season and can play on either wing or as a striker. 

Leeds have been working on a number of names including Manchester United's Dan James but the Old Trafford club need cover until they sign their own winger.

Utrecht have also received enquiries from Cagliari and Verona for Kerk but they are offering around £6m.  

Marcelo Bielsa has also insisted Leeds captain Liam Cooper 'is a huge part of this club' following the arrival of Spain defender Diego Llorente.

Llorente, 27, completed a reported £18million move from Real Sociedad this week, while another international centre-half, Germany's Robin Koch, joined Leeds last month from Freiburg for a fee of around £13m.
