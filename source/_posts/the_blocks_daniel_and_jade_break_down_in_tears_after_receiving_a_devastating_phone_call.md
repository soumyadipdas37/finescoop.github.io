Daniel and Jade received some devastating news during Tuesday's episode of The Block, which forced them to temporarily leave the hit show.

The South Australian couple were in the middle of renovations on their bathroom when Daniel's dad called to inform him his grandfather had died.

Clearly shocked by the heartbreaking turn of events, Daniel, 35, pulled Jade aside to inform her of the news, prompting her to break down and cry.

'It's all good. We knew it was going on... He was sick. We knew that,' an emotional Daniel tried to reassure Jade, 34, engulfing her in a hug.

'I know, but you were that close. It's not fair,' a tearful Jade told him, as she sobbed into his shoulder.

Daniel and Jade revealed they'd told his grandfather they were appearing on The Block while he was sick in hospital, in the hope it would give him strength to hold on.

Later in the episode, Jade admitted they were having a hard time getting motivated to finish the bathroom.

'I wanted to leave as soon as possible to go and see the family that was still at home, looking after our kids, and spend some family time with my mum and dad and Jade's mum and dad,' explained Daniel.

He added: 'It was important for us to get back.'

After talking to the show's host, Scott Cam, the couple revealed they were leaving to attend Daniel's grandfather's funeral.

'I can organise Keith [Schleiger] and Dan [Reilly] to manage your trades, and even if need be, get on a paintbrush and paint for you,' offered Scott, 57.

He added: 'I guarantee 100 per cent it will be finished Sunday morning to your standards.'

His generous offer left an appreciative Daniel and Jade overwhelmed by emotion, and they revealed Scott did everything he could to get them back home.  

'With open arms, Scotty said, "Mate, I'll make it happen. You're on your way home,"' explained a grateful Daniel. 

'He had our back and he organised a few things behind the scenes that was going to happen while we were away.'
