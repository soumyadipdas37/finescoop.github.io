The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has previously been forced to deny claims that she's an aspiring actress.

But the brunette beauty's past as a social media influencer and model has been revealed after her many sponsored posts resurfaced online.

Now a brand new ad featuring the 25-year-old has been revealed.

Not again! A new ad campaign featuring The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has surfaced online

The marketing consultant appears in promotional photos for the Showbag Shop, which is a website that sells the showbags that you normally buy at the Melbourne Show.

Judging by the pictures on the website, Bella appears to be promoting fashion and beauty-themed showbags.

This is far from the first sponsored content that Bella has been involved with.

In one post shared to Facebook, Bella holds up a bottle of ReefSun tanning oil while offering her followers a chance to win a tropical holiday. 

Another post features two 'candid' photos of Bella holding a bottle of BondiBoost hair treatment. 

'I couldn't choose between these two photos so here are both, don't get @ me,' she wrote alongside the hashtags #BondiBoost #BoostYourRoots and #Ad.

Bella has previously described herself as a girl with 'an ardour for writing, style, beauty, travel, food and wellness'.

'I have worked on jobs from magazine editorials, fashion e-commerce websites to Instagram content,' she states in her biography on TheRight.fit website.

TheRight.fit is a platform that allows marketing companies to scout and browse talent for endorsements. 

Days earlier, a 2017 television advertisement for retail chain TK Maxx starring Bella surfaced online.

The commercial shows her dancing around a wooden clothing stand in a variety of different outfits.

Last week, Bella publicly slammed allegations she was an aspiring actress who once dreamt of moving to LA to further her career.

'I've never moved to LA, I've never wanted or tried to be an actress in Australia, never wanted or tried to get work as an actress in LA and certainly am not acting on the Bachelor,' she wrote on Instagram.

Without naming names, she claimed that people had tried to 'fabricate' stories about her in order to feel 'relevant' and 'important'.

During an anonymous Q&A session on The Bachelor last week, the other contestants surprised Bella with a question about her influencer career.

They asked her if she was on the show to get more followers, and she replied that she already had enough followers and was only interested in Locky Gilbert.

Locky was also asked if Bella was his 'favourite'. He responded by saying that he didn't have favourites and was still getting to know everyone.
