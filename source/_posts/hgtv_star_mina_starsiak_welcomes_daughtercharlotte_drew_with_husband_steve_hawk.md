Mina Starsiak and husband Steve Hawk welcomed their second child together on Wednesday.

In photos posted to the Good Bones star's Instagram account on Wednesday morning, Starsiak, 35, appeared tired but happy as she cuddled with her newborn daughter, Charlotte Drew.

'She’s here!!!!' the HGTV fixture captioned the post. 'Charlotte Drew Hawk.' 

New addition! Mina Starsiak and husband Steve Hawk welcomed their second child together on Wednesday

'Charlie' weighed 7 lbs., 6 oz., and measured 18.5 inches long, the couple's rep told People. 

'We are just obsessed with our little family and can't wait for Jack to be the best big brother to sweet Charlie,' they said in a statement.

Mina and Steve already have a son, Jack Richard, who was born in August 2018.

The arrival comes with particular joy after Starsiak spent months documenting her struggles with infertility on social media.  

'When I told [Steve] I was pregnant with Jack, he just started crying. When I told him I was pregnant this time, it was shock,' Mina told People at the time.

While she got pregnant easily the first time around, conceiving baby number two was harder.

Excitement: 'We are just obsessed with our little family and can't wait for Jack to be the best big brother to sweet Charlie,' they said in a statement

'Based on our experience with Jack, by month three of trying, I was like, "This is not going to schedule. This isn’t how it happened the first time. There’s no reason it should be taking this long,"' she said.

She first spoke about struggling to get pregnant in June of last year, taking to Instagram to open up to her fans and friends.

'This nugget came easy but #2 is being far more stubborn!' she wrote, posting a picture of herself with Jack.

'I can’t seem to get my [body's] schedule figured out but I’m rocking ​@avawomen to figure it out for me.​ You just wear this to bed and it measures signals in your body to pinpoint your fertile days. Fingers crossed for #2 soon!'

Shook: 'When I told [Steve] I was pregnant with Jack, he just started crying. When I told him I was pregnant this time, it was shock,' Mina told People at the time

She tried several things to help increase her chances of getting pregnant, and in July 2019 she shared a photo of herself getting acupuncture, with nearly a dozen needles poking out of her stomach.

'For those of you who’ve tried making a baby, it’s whatever works! So this is round 2 of acupuncture,' she wrote at the time.

They soon moved to IVF, but their first round failed. After, they decided to give getting pregnant one more shot before they 'settled with being done.'

For the last attempt, they tried intrauterine insemination, in which a doctor injected sperm directly into Mina's uterus.

It worked, and now they're a family of four.

'It doesn’t feel real yet. But when we heard the heartbeat, there were so many happy tears,' Mina said after revealing she'd conceived.
