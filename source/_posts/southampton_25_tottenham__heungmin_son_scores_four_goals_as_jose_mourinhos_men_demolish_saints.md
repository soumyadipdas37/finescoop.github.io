Heung-min Son scored four goals and his first ever Spurs hat-trick in a seven-goal thriller against Southampton.

The South Korean's goals were all set up by Harry Kane, who added a fifth strike as Spurs got up and running in the Premier League.

Danny Ings scored twice for the hosts for his first goals of the season, but the Saints were blown away by a double act from the Tottenham forward duo in the second half.¬†

Host commentator

Wow, what an afternoon we have had, and seven more goals and plenty of talking points to go through.

Thanks for joining us, and make sure to keep an eye out for all the reaction to this and the day's other action.

Tottenham captain Harry Kane speaking to BT Sport:¬†'We spoke before the game that there would be space in behind. There was one pass [to Heung-min Son] where I didn't even look. It was just about putting the ball in the spaces.'

On his partnership with Son:¬†'It's a connection we've been building for some time now, I'm proud of him.'

'It's great to have Sergio and Gareth with us. It's a busy schedule over the next couple of months.

'Everyone knows Gareth, the goals and assists he gets. We have great competition for places and I'm sure he'll be excited to get back out and play for Spurs.'

Son speaking to BT Sport: 'It's incredible. To score three goals in the Premier League is a big honour. With this guy [Harry Kane], four amazing assists and to score a goal, I think he deserves Man of the Match today.

'We are working almost now for five seasons together. We know what we like. Obviously Harry is one of the best strikers. We are working together so many times. We work so hard to have a good relationship off the pitch and on it. I enjoy working with this amazing player and hopefully many more to come.

'I think it was very important, especially at the end of the first half. We struggled in the first half a little bit and didn't play the way we wanted.

'We deserved the win and came back strongly in the second half. It was a bit of a shame not to score more than five goals.'

5 - Harry Kane is the first player to be directly involved in 5 goals in a @PremierLeague game (1 goal, 4 assists) since Mo Salah v Watford in March 2018 (4 goals, 1 assist). It's the second time Kane has done so (also May 2017 v Leicester). Quintet. pic.twitter.com/3c4UbYzeKi

There were plenty of subplots before the game, and now there are many talking points afterwards.

Heung-min Son stole the show by scoring four of Tottenham's five goals today, an unbelievable display from the South Korean.

But not too far behind was Harry Kane, who assisted all of Son's goal and added one himself at the end.

Danny Ings scored twice for the hosts but that counted for little as they imploded in the second half, as Spurs claim their first win of the new season in the league and consign Southampton to a third straight loss.

This will certainly raise hopes of a successful Spurs season. They have a run of fixtures which does not allow a lot of rest right now but with Bale and Reguilon in, Spurs seem to be back today.

A coolly taken penalty from Ings who gets his second of the day and the season, but the awarding of the penalty looks incredibly harsh.

Four minutes added on at the end here too.

This follows Victor Lindelof's handball yesterday, and this seems seemingly harsh against the Spurs defender, and Jermaine Jenas believes we have lost common sense on the issue.

VAR has advised referee David Coote to take as look at a potential handball against Matt Doherty...

4 - Harry Kane has assisted all four of Son Heung-Min's goals against Southampton today - the first time in @premierleague history one player has assisted another four times in a single match. Fabulous. pic.twitter.com/EloGFWjEyE

And that is Harry Kane's final involvement, as he gets a tap on the back from Mourinho after being replaced by Steven Bergwijn.

No it isn't Son, but Harry Kane gets his deserved goal but it is more poor defending from the hosts.

Erik Lamela is not closely marked by Jack Stephens who dawdles and does not challenge the Argentine, who hits the post.

But it rebounds to Kane, who taps home for his 190th Spurs goal.

Yellow card for Matt Doherty for a foul on Djenepo, who has been a bystander for the hosts during the Son and Kane double onslaught.

Hasenhuttl also makes a change, with the frustrated Che Adams coming off for Shane Long.

I don't think I can recall a game quite like this in the Premier League for a few years, but it won't matter for the Saints who are set for a third straight defeat.

¬†

This is getting ridiculous from Southampton, and Son has an unprecedented four. Yes, four.

It has been an individual masterclass from Son, who again meets a Kane cross to fire past McCarthy, but Lo Celso easily finds the England striker and they were so easily in.

Crazy stuff from Hasenhuttl's men.

This line is making it too easy for Spurs. This time Dier plays the ball over the top but Son this time hits a shot that goes wildly wide, but to his relief the flag is raised.

Jack Stephens goes into the book for a crunching challenge on Lo Celso as the hosts are left stunned by what has happened to them since the 44th minute.

It's that combination of Kane and Son again and the latter notches his hat-trick from three chances.

Southampton's high line is coming back to bite them here, but that should not take away from the quality of Kane's clipped ball to find the onrushing Son.

And there was never any doubt Son would finish, an emphatic strike to give Spurs some breathing space.

Second change for Spurs, with Erik Lamela replacing Lucas Moura just after the hour.

The offside flag is playing a big part in this game, and again it comes to ensure Southampton do not completely rue an effort on target.

Djenepo knicks the ball and finds Armstrong when he could have had a go, and the latter then curls over.

"He never misses those!"Heung-min Son is ruthless üí•Harry Kane provides another assist as Spurs hit Southampton either side of half-time! pic.twitter.com/G7DLLxl4wv

Another save from Lloris, this time from close range to deny Armstrong, but the play is brought back for offside against creator Ings.

Here is the evidence of the latest tactical battle, with Southampton getting Tottenham's defenders to head away crosses before Kane goes for the halfway line spectacular but gets it all wrong, to the bemusement of Mourinho.

A very difficult scoreline to try and make sense of with Southampton continuing to create opportunities.

Ward-Prowse is the latest player to test Lloris with an effort but Tottenham are now looking to hit the hosts on the break.

Erm, where on earth has this come from then?

After equalising at the end of the half, Son has put Spurs into an undeserved lead at St Mary's.

Kane does brilliantly to weight his ball perfectly for Son, who races clear and then slams home his second of the day.

Wow.

Southampton's flowing football has continued despite Spurs' goal just before the break.

Again it is Djenepo who causes danger but Adams hits it at Lloris.

Well, that is a surprise.

Ndombele is replaced by Giovanni Lo Celso at the break, as Spurs get us back underway.

How crucial will that goal be for Tottenham right on the stroke of half-time?

Well it was only the second goal of the day despite the ball having nestled in the net on five separate occasions today.

Harry Kane and Danny Ings had goals ruled out for offside and handball respectively before the latter put the Saints ahead from a tight angle.

But after a tepid Spurs performance, Son caught out McCarthy and levelled to give the visitors some hope going and momentum going into the second half

Or maybe not.

Three moments of quality later, Spurs are surprisingly level thanks to a brilliant finish from Son.

Ndombele does amazingly to hold off the challenge, spin and then find Kane on the break and he plays the ball across to Son. McCarthy is caught in no man's land but there is a lot to do for Son, but he keeps his balance brilliantly before finding the far corner.

Three minutes added on at the end of the first half, with a lot of heads down and sullen looks among the Spurs players.

Meanwhile, Tanguy Ndombele becomes the latest player to go into the book.

Jose Mourinho has got a lot of thinking to do ahead of half-time with one minute to go until the break.

They look devoid of ideas much as they did in midweek against Lokomotiv Plovdiv, but they are facing a confident Southampton outfit here.

Harry Kane looks like a very frustrated man right now.

He is tackled by Walker-Peters and Stephens in quick succession in the wide areas and then makes a clean but strong tackle on his former team-mate.

And that's even without considering his two ruled out goals.

Southampton are coming up with all the answers right now.

They fly down the left again and Bertrand's cross is well intercepted by Lloris to end a dangerous attack.

Che Adams is also booked after the move breaks down.

A deserved lead for the Saints, who had been threatening more in the last few minutes, as Mourinho looks on bemused with his side behind again.

Hugo Lloris has been caught off guard but he should do better here.

Kyle Walker-Peters lofts a ball over the top for Ings, who does brilliantly to take the ball down and fire immediately from the right of the area.

But the angle was against Ings and he smashed his effort past Lloris into the far corner, who drops his head in disappointment.

And no, this one has not been ruled out, as Ings gets his first this season.

Danny Ings got 21 Premier League goals last season and with that in mind it is strange to see him not going for goal here.

He opens Spurs up with their midfield now being quite easily opened up unlike the start of the game, but chooses to try and lay it to Ward-Prowse inside the box.

But he overhits the pass and the ball passes harmlessly out of play with a shot definitely on.

I think we've had enough disallowed goals for the season at St Mary's today.

This one is a bit more clear cut and with the assistants being told to keep their flags down until the end of the move this is more understandable.

But Kane is denied a goal for the second time as provider Lucas Moura is given offside without VAR.

Djenepo is causing real problems for Spurs at the moment.

Harry Kane heads out a Ward-Prowse free-kick but the Mali star runs onto it and catches it really well with his left foot and the effort clips the outside of the post.

Brilliant block from Davies!

Doherty thinks he has ushered Moussa Djenepo out of play but the Mali international somehow keeps it in play by the byline and finds Adams, who is composed and looks set to score, only for Davies to throw his body at it before Lloris claws away Ward-Prowse's scuffed rebound effort.

It has very much been a midfield battle which has created the majority of the chances today, and so far it is Ndombele and Hojbjerg who are getting the fouls and winning the duels.

Fifteen minutes, and two disallowed goals already at St Mary's.

Ings manages to stay onside and latch onto a ball over the top. Lloris comes out and heads the ball but straight into Ings, who impudently finishes.

However, the goal is correctly ruled out with Ings controlling the ball with his arm from Lloris' unconvincing header.

Tanguy Ndombele put in some incisive passes in midweek and he looks to re-create some of that magic by slipping through Kane.

The England striker knows he is offside and leaves it for Son, who despite also being offside, forces a save from McCarthy.

What a save that is from Hugo Lloris!

Spurs do not clear Bertrand's free-kick well and it falls to Adams around the penalty spot. Adams goes for power rather than placement but Frenchman Lloris does well to spring and touch the effort over the bar.

A lively start to this one at St Mary's, as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg the recipient of a strong challenge from Oriol Romeu on the Dane's return to Southampton.

Romeu is duly booked.

Nearly the perfect start for the visitors following Harry Kane's fantastic finish.

Son gets a cross in to the box and Doherty arrives to keep the ball alive and heads it into the path of Kane, who swivels and fires under McCarthy.

But VAR intervenes and shows Son slightly leaning offside when the ball was played over the top, and the goal is disallowed.

Matt Doherty gets an early talking to for a strong challenge on Djenepo, as Spurs begin their first of three games in six days this week.

It is the hosts who get us underway at St Mary's, with both sides looking for their first Premier League win this season.

The players are all set to come out to an empty St Mary's ahead of this opening Sunday fixture, with three more set to follow.

Will Son & co. do the damage or is there more misery for Spurs here?

'We have a huge squad. I don't like to have it. It is not easy for me to have 18 players and 10 training in the training ground. I don't like it. We have too many players for some positions.'

A very strong message from Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho to Dele Alli after he was left out of the squad.

Glenn Hoddle has backed him to make a comeback, but his future is looking uncertain right now.

4 & 88 - Southampton have won each of their last four Premier League games played on a Sunday, as many as they managed across their previous 23 such matches (D8 L11). Meanwhile, Tottenham have lost more Premier League games on Sunday than any other side (88). Contrast. #SOUTOT pic.twitter.com/y2hvg8eyF5

More quotes from Bale:

On Jose Mourinho: '¬†Yeah he spoke to me about the positions he would like me to play. Obviously he is a big name, a household name and a winner. He is a perfect fit for Tottenham and he knows how to win trophies better than anyone.

On the new stadium?: 'It is completely different to WHL. The stadium is incredible, the facilities are incredible. It is the highest standard. This club is on the right path to becoming a powerhouse and it is just nice to be part of it.'

How will Bale's return mean for Harry Kane given the England captain's desire to challenge for this season's Golden Boot?

Sportsmail's DANNY MURPHY believes there are only going to be positives for the Tottenham star with the Welshman's return.

'I love the club, I loved my time here, and hopefully we can try and win a trophy if not two'.

'The highs were incredibly high at Real Madrid and the lows were perhaps even lower'.

Gareth Bale has made his feelings clear regarding his ambitions and the club's this season in an interview with BT Sport ahead of today's game.

St Mary's is basking in glorious sunshine today but it has not been a particularly cheery place for Spurs to come lately.

The north London side lost 1-0 to the Saints on the south coast on New Year's Day, a defeat which was compounded by a serious hamstring injury to Harry Kane.

Spurs also drew 1-1 with Hasenhuttl's men a few weeks later in the FA Cup fourth round before going on to win the replay at home.

The aforementioned return of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to St Mary's is just one of the many other story lines ahead of today's game.

Gareth Bale has given Spurs an enormous lift since arriving back at the club on loan, but whether that can translate onto the pitch without his presence due to injury will be another matter.

Tottenham also want to add another striker to their squad before the transfer window closes and have been linked with a move for Saints striker Danny Ings, who finished level with Arsenal star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Premier League goals last season.

After a disappointing start at Crystal Palace last week, Ralph Hasenhuttl will be desperate to keep hold of Ings but with the end of the window nearing interest could hot up.

After proving pivotal in Spurs overcoming their Bulgarian midweek challenge, Tanguy Ndombele gets his start for the club this season in the Premier League today.

His Spurs career to date has had more troughs than peaks, but could he be the answer to a midfield currently devoid of a driving force?

Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has never been one to shy away from his feelings, but as ADRIAN KAJUMBA reports, that is part of the reason he may be a perfect fit for Jose Mourinho's Tottenham revolution.

After being left out in midweek in Bulgaria, Sportsmail's SAMI MOKBEL reports that Dele Alli has not been included in the Spurs squad today as uncertainty over his future grows.

A Super Sunday with plenty of subplots in store, the action from the Premier League kicks off again with Southampton facing Tottenham.

The visitors have been buoyed in recent days by the return of Gareth Bale on a season-long loan, with the Welshman receiving a hero's welcome back.

Spurs have also signed Sergio Reguilon and while neither will feature today, the side will hope their presence is enough to lift spirits following their damaging defeat to Everton last weekend.

A Europa League midweek win in Plovdiv was nervy before Harry Kane and Tanguy Ndombele came up with the goods, and now Jose Mourinho will be looking for his first league win of the new season.
