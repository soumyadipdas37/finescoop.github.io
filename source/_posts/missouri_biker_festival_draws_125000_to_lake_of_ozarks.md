And while some bikers were wearing masks, many opted out of the facial covering. 

'Actually, I got it out as a joke to put it on and give it to you, normally I'm not wearing it,' Ed Allsman told KY3. 

Bubby Fischer said: 'It's what we get dealt with in life. You know, you go out to enjoy, if you get dealt with it, it's what happens.'

Another biker, Dustin Fletcher, told the station that 'we’re out to have a good time, catch some free wind, and get some road miles and actually some therapy on the way'.

Fletcher said the coronavirus 'doesn't stop us'. 

'You can ask any biker, or whatever, anything going on in the world, it ain't gonna stop us riding,' Fletcher said.
