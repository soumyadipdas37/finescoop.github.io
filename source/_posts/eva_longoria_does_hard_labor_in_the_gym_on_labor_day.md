Former Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria is fighting the urge to just put her feet up during quarantine.

In fact, even on Labor Day she refused to give herself a day off from the grind of looking great.

The 45-year-old actress showed off her fit form on Monday, amid a punishing gym session, which she caught on Instagram saying: 'Doing some hard labor on this Labor Day!'

The busy mother is often sharing intimate snaps of her son, Santiago Enrique Bastón, who she welcomed in 2018 with husband José Bastón. 

In April this year, Eva also shared an honest moment, revealing her grey roots which she had been struggling to conceal in lockdown, telling fans: 'Hi guys! Look at all this grey. This is crazy!' 

The actress continued: 'If you've been following me, you know that I've been going grey.'

She then whipped out a root spray by L'Oreal Paris, for whom she serves as an ambassador, which she used to blend her locks back to their raven hue in seconds.

Eva has been keeping herself busy amid the coronavirus pandemic, sharing footage of herself working out, and also appearing in a Desperate Housewives reunion.

Texas native Eva returned home to quarantine earlier this in March, after travelling to Italy, the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.

On February 20, Eva flew from Los Angeles to Rome to shoot a short film amid the coronavirus outbreak that has since put all of Italy under lockdown.

She was staying in Castel Gandolfo, a medieval town 25 kilometres away from the capital, and was pictured running through the woods while shooting a scene.

Near the end of February, she assured her Instagram followers that she was all right since she was not in northern Italy, where the virus first became a major concern.

Keeping it real: However, the former Desperate Housewives star also shared this honest moment with fans in April, showing off her grey hairs  

'Hi everybody. I am shooting in this small town in Italy. I am nowhere near the North, thank you for your concerns,' she said.

'Everyone was calling and texting me about the coronavirus in the north of Italy. It's really sad, but we're further away.'
