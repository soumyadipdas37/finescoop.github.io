Ford is coming off The Call of the Wild, which hit theaters in February before theaters across the country shut down due to COVID-19.

The actor signed onto star in The Staircase back in November, his first TV series starring role in his illustrious career, according to Variety.

The series is based on a documentary series of the same name, following the trial of author Michael Peterson, who claimed his wife died after falling down a staircase, though police believed he staged it to look like an accident.
