Irina Shayk commanded attention in a figure-hugging dress on Thursday afternoon, as she turned the sidewalk into her personal runway in New York City. 

On her laid-back strut, the Vogue cover girl showcased her model physique in a cobalt blue motorsport-inspired minidress with a top-to-bottom zipper down the front.  

With her toned legs on full display, the thigh-skimming outfit guaranteed Irina, 34, plenty of attention from onlookers during her latest strut around the Big Apple.

She accentuated her leggy frame with a pair of black leather booties, which hit her tan and muscular calves. 

The bombshell oozed confidence, as she accessorized her ensemble with a tiny yellow purse and a few delicate chains around her neck. 

While the Russian beauty opted not to wear a CDC-recommended mask, she completed her look with a pair of large hoop earrings and tiny black sunglasses.

Irina did not appear to be joined by her three-year-old daughter Lea, whom she shares with her ex-boyfriend Bradley Cooper. 

The couple split after four years together last year, and have been co-parenting their little one together ever since.

Bradley recently revealed he had been teaching their daughter how to swim in his bathtub, while caring for his mother Gloria Campano at home.

'I'm with my daughter and my mother and my two dogs, and we have not left the house,' he said in a discussion with Interview Magazine.

She added: 'My mother is going to be 80, and she has a colostomy bag, so I can't let anybody in the house. And I can't leave the house, because if she gets it, it's over.'

'We live in a little townhouse, thankfully there's a backyard. I'm running a one-man preschool. We get up, we do swim class in the bathtub.'
