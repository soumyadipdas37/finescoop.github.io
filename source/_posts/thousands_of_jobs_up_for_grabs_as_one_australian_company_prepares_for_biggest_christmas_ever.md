The mail service is embarking on its largest hiring spree in its 210-year history and is looking to snap up 2,900 Christmas casuals for transport and delivery across the country 

These opportunities are available in Brisbane and regional areas of South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland. 

Nine-hundred staff are also sought after to work in areas such as the Post Office network. 

Last year 23,000 people applied for casual positions at Australia Post at Christmas.

Earlier this year, more than 50,000 people applied for 1000 casual positions created to cope with the increased volume of parcels during the pandemic. 

Sue Davies, executive general manager of People & Culture, said she is proud of how Australia Post has worked in unprecedented times. 

'A lot has been expected of our people this year and I'm so proud of the way our team has adapted and dealt with the challenges they've faced to keep delivering for Australia across our entire network,' Ms Davies said.

'In managing all the necessary COVID-safe requirements, including a reduced workforce in our Melbourne facilities during the recent Stage 4 restrictions, our people have gone over and above to provide critical services for businesses and their customers and delivered for over 8.1 million households who have shopped online between March and August alone.

'This is a record-breaking recruitment drive for what we expect to be a Christmas unlike any we've had before in Australia Post's history. 

'In a year that has been incredibly challenging and impacted people in many ways, we are delighted to be inviting people to join us this Christmas as we deliver across the country.'
