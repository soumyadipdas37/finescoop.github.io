Tottenham have completed the signing of Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid for £30million.

The left-back, who has signed a five-year deal, will wear the No 3 shirt, which was taken off Danny Rose, who is likely to leave. 

The announcement of Reguilon's signing was closely followed by confirmation that Gareth Bale has rejoined Tottenham on loan from Real Madrid.

Jose Mourinho will hope that Reguilon, 23, will give Tottenham greater defensive security at left-back.

Reguilon wrote on Instagram: 'Excited about this new challenge. Happy to play for @spursofficial.' 

A product of Real Madrid's academy, he made 22 senior appearances for Zinedine Zidane's side, all of which came in the 2018-19 campaign.
