Wow! Georgia Harrison looked nothing short of sensational as she made her way to brunch with her friend and fellow TOWIE alum Fran Parman on Saturday

Georgia showcased her surgically-enhanced assets in a plunging black crop top, which also displayed her washboard abs.

The reality personality teamed her top with a pair of tan leather trousers and a pair of Yves Saint Lauren black heels, featuring the brand's logo.

She wore her highlighted locks in a bouncy blown out style and featured a neutrally-toned pallet of make-up, including a slick of lip gloss.

The Ex On The Beach star shielded her eyes from the autumn rays in a pair of square shades, while also accessorising with a gold chain and clutch bag.

Meanwhile, Fran, 29, looked equally glamorous in a white polo neck which she tucked into a leather mini skirt and a pair of heeled boots.

She layered her ensemble with a cream coat, and styled the look with a gold chain necklace and a pair of circular shades.

It comes after Georgia revealed she already feels 'so much more confident' with her new boobs, and said she had the operation after her 3.5stone weight loss left her with sagging skin and stretch marks.

The television personality told Closer magazine: 'I'd see myself on TV wearing swimwear and think, "Oh, my boobs don't look good", and it made me feel very self-conscious.'

Georgia went on to say she would limit what she would, only opting for padded tops or tops with high necklines.

Explaining why she had surgery, the reality star said: 'I'm around 8.5st now, but when I was about 19 I was nearer 12st and my boobs were a lot bigger, I was working abroad and had a really unhealthy lifestyle, and I'd drink and just eat junk.

'But when my weight dropped a bit, so did my boobs, it looked like there was space to fill. I also had a problem with inverted nipples that I wanted to fix.' 

Georgia first found fame with a brief stint on The Only Way Is Essex in 2014, before becoming a household name with an appearance on 2017's Love Island.

The bubbly reality star then gained an American fanbase when she starred in series 33 of The Challenge in 2018, reaching the final and finishing in eighth place.

The Challenge saw reality stars from around the world come together to compete in a series of physical and mental challenges in the hope of the scooping prize money.
