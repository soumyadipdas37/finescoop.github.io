The Star casino's coronavirus protocols have come under scrutiny after security guards told a man with a 48C temperature to 'cool down and come back'. 

A viral video posted by the satirical news site The Chaser, put the Sydney venue's COVID-19 screening process to the test in a comedic video.

The presenter artificially raised his temperature by putting a heat pack on his forehead to find out 'how sick you have to be for them not to let you gamble?'

But The Star have labelled the 'edited' video a 'stunt' and said it doesn't represent what really happened. 

Scroll down the video. 

Serious questions have been raised about The Star casino's coronavirus protocols after security guards told a man (pictured) with a temperature reading of 48C  to 'cool off'

When he attempts to enter the gaming floor, guards carry out a temperature check using an infrared thermometer gun.

But when reading comes back at 48C, the blasé security guards tell the man to 'cool down for 10 minutes or so' and 'come back'.

Seemingly unconcerned by the extremely high reading - 11C above what is considered normal at 37C - a guard suggests that perhaps his 'Russian hat' is to blame for the reading. 

The alarmingly casual approach to the screening process comes after a coronavirus-positive man visited the The Star two months earlier. 

A gambler visited the glitzy venue on July 4 and was later found to be infected. 

The Star was forced to undergo a massive deep clean before reopening. 

At the beginning of the video, a Chaser presenter arrives at the casino in a hospital gown and attempts to make entry but he is refused.

The Star told Daily Mail Australia the 'gown stunt' was their last interaction with security officers.

'Clearly this has been created as a comedic and satirical stunt. It's what these guys do,' the casino said in statement.

'However, the video published completely misrepresents events through substantial editing and reordering of events. 

'No one with a high temperature was permitted entry to the casino and the hospital gown episode was reported to police due to welfare concerns.

'Further, the claim that the person in the gown later gained entry after changing clothes is false.   

NSW recorded four new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday.

Three of the cases were returned travellers staying in hotel quarantine and one case was linked to a known cluster.

The patient had already been in self-isolation because they were a close contact of an infected person linked to the Concord Hospital outbreak in Sydney.

There are currently 136 active coronavirus cases in NSW.
