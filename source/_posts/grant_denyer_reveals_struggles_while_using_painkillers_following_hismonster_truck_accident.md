Grant Denyer has revealed how his life went downhill while he was using painkillers.

The 43-year-old Family Feud host was on a concoction of endone and morphine while recovering from a broken back injury after a monster truck accident.

'Mad sh*t that went on …. when I closed my eyes and couldn't tell the difference between reality and my dream,' he said on his It's All True podcast on Monday.

REVEALED: Grant Denyer, 43, (pictured) has revealed he 'couldn't tell the difference between reality and a dream' as he candidly opened up about using painkillers 

'As soon as you close your eyes you go into your worst nightmares,' Grant continued.

'The things that you are afraid of the most are the first things that happen the moment you fall asleep and you start dreaming.'

'It is traumatic as every time you sleep and then when you wake up you can't tell what is real and what isn't.'

Also speaking on the podcast, his wife Chezzi explained the medication was the worst part of her husband's injury by far.

'So many drug psychosis episodes where Grant would kick me out of the house thinking I was an imposter dressed up as Chezzi!' she said.

With Chezzi, 40, slowly weaning him off the meds, Grant remembered one night leaving the house in his undies to get some scotch.

Chezzi explained Grant left the house to buy Scotch - dressed only in his underwear - and she searched the city streets only to find him asleep face down in a fire exit surrounded by 'filth and human poo'.

But the experience totally connected them, albeit in an unhealthy way, as 'we learnt the term co-dependant - our existence during that period and afterwards was patient and nurse.'

Grant's new podcast IT'S ALL TRUE? is available to be streamed now.
