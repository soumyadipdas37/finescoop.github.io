The daughter of a woman who has served more than 40 years in prison for a 'recommending' a hitman in a murder-for-hire plot has said she does not deserve her lifelong sentence and remains 'hopeful' she'll be released. 

Judy White, 74, is imprisoned at Iowa Correctional Institution for her role in the 1979 killing of family friend Ady Jensen, after she recommended a 'crazy' hitman to his wife and her friend, Jeanne Jenson, who wanted him dead.

The hitman, Andrew Oglevie, was an associate of Judy's second husband Robert Kern, and prosecutors alleged that White, along with Jeanne, Oglevie and Kern conspired to kill Ady to collect a $50,000 life insurance payout. 

Judy, whose story featured earlier this year on Stacey Dooley's programme Locked Up With The Lifers, has long-admitted that she should have been punished for the crime but said she should not have received a life sentence because she had no role in his actual killing, while Jeanne only received a ten-year sentence for her part in the plot and ended up serving just four years.

One of Judy's five children, daughter Cynthia Dengue, has now insisted her mother doesn't deserve to be in prison, telling Stacey on her BBC podcast Stacey Dooley Revisits: 'She wasn't even present when the crime itself took place.

'Of course she should have served time, it is undeniable, but she served over 40 years when she didn't actually kill this man.' 

The daughter of woman Judy White, 74, who has served more than 40 years in prison for a'recommending' a hitman in a murder-for-hire plot said she does not deserve her lifelong sentence (pictured, with Stacey Dooley in a recent documentary)

Judy was a friend of Jeanne, Ady's wife, who she had met in church with Cynthia revealing she and her family 'went to their house all the time'.

She said that her mother had a conversation with Jeanne about the fact the second woman was not happy in her marriage to Ady.

Cynthia explained: 'She wanted her husband dead. So apparently, my mother mentioned Bob knew somebody crazy enough to do this.'

Ady, 39, of Iowa City, was fatally shot in April 1979 at his parents’ farm in West Branch. 

When he arrived at the house, his parents, Ferdinand and Olga, had already been tied up and kept hostage for 12 hours by a hitman who had been paid $50 to kill their son. 

When Oglevie was tried for being the shooter — he was acquitted May 3, 1983 — details emerged about the plot in which Jeanne, Ady Jensen’s wife, Robert and Judy, then married to Kern, planned to collect a $50,000 insurance policy. 

It emerged Robert, who was an insurance agent, had sold the policy to Jeanne without her husband's knowledge.   

Speaking of the moment her mother was arrested, when Cynthia was aged just nine, she said: 'It was a beautiful summer day, all these cars streamed down the street.

'Some police cars, some undercover cars. And I told this older girl, "They are going to my house", and she said, "Do you need me to go with you?"

'I just started running towards the house and she did follow me and sure I enough i get to my house and there's flashlights going through the windows. 

'Furniture had been torn apart and I just had that feeling of panic in my chest. I saw a sheriff that used to go to our church and then my mother in handcuffs.

'She was crying and I said "Mom, what is going on?" and she said,  "They think I killed Ady Jensen" and I just sat there not knowing why or what.' 

The trial went to court in October 1979 with Judy, who had only recently married Robert and was pregnant with her youngest child, Brandon, at the time, agreeing to agreed with Robert's plan they would not testify against each other at his trial.

Although she had arguably played a larger role than Judy in her husband's killing, Jeanne received a lesser sentence in exchange for testifying against Robert and Judy. 

Cynthia continued: 'Judy knew about it, she definitely did, does that deserve punishment? Yes. 

'But, this woman, Jeanne, wanted her husband killed, admitted that in the trial and in the case was able to bargain out of that and then turn the story against my mother and Robert (Kern).

'And they got life sentences. I don't know if a better lawyer or something else would have been the miracle to not have her go to prison for life.' 

Judy pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and was given a ten-year sentence, which she ultimately only served four years of.  

On Locked Up With The Lifers, the moment was shown where Judy was with Stacey and received a letter saying Iowa's parole board would hear her case to be freed from jail

Speaking to Stacey, Cynthia said being without her mother permanently changed her life, explaining: 'As children, to have your parent taken away at such a young age, it definitely alters your life, it has changed forever.

'I have tried not to think of my mum as gone, we have been able to have a very close relationship. That is on the part of both of us making a huge effort.'

'I carried with me a lot of shame for many, many years. I went through rage and trouble and depression and anxiety, all of those things.

'We didn't go to counselling as children [and] that probably would have been helpful.'

On Locked Up With The Lifers, the moment was shown where Judy was with Stacey and received a letter saying Iowa's parole board would hear her case to be freed from jail.

Stacey said she formed a bond with Judy after visiting her in prison, where she has been for more than 40 years

The 74-year-old was seen in tears as her hopes were raised that she may finally be able to leave prison.

At the parole hearing, four of the five members recommended Judy for commutation. But one did not. The decision therefore rested with Governor Reynolds.

Sadly, much to the extreme distress of Judy and her children, the Governor opted in August not to commute Judy's sentence.

This was despite Iowa's Attorney General, Tom Miller, recommending that she should be released. 

He told the Governor that Judy was the 'least culpable' of all parties involved in Ady's murder.  

In a second conversation after the verdict, Cynthia told Stacey: 'We were really shell-shocked, we really were. All of us had our hopes up.

'For each of us it brings up different trauma from childhood. But I was mostly worried about my Mom. She definitely had a breakdown.

'That's how we have all dealt with it. Then you have to realise, what is the obstacle exactly?

'Apparently, in her letter, a few things that the governor wrote her, one is that she doesn't have unanimous support from the parole board.

'The second thing was the seriousness of the offence, but again we could argue she had the least part to do with that crime.'

However, Judy continues to have hope that she will one day be released from prison, saying: 'My mum is still very positive. She is still very hopeful. I don't think that's blind faith. Whether her faith is blind or eyes wide open, either way it is faith.

'So I respect that about her. I tell people she is the strongest person I know.'
