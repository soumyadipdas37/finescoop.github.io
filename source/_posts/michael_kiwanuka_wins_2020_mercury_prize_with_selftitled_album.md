Michael Kiwanuka has been revealed as the 2020 Mercury Prize winner for his self-titled third album.

The singer's success was announced live on The One Show on Thursday, with Annie Mac telling him the news before he was interviewed by Alex Jones and Amol Rajan.

Expressing his delight, Michael said: 'This is ridiculous, it's crazy! I'm so happy. Third time's a charm... I'm so excited - this is for art, for music, for albums. 

Congratulations! Michael Kiwanuka has been revealed as the 2020 Mercury Prize winner for his self-titled third album 

'This is the only thing I've ever wanted to do so to win a Mercury is a dream come true. I'm so happy. Music and art means so much to me and this is an award that celebrates that so I'm over the moon.'

Michael went up against musicians including Charli XCX, Dua Lipa and Stormzy for the 2020 Hyundai Mercury Prize for Album of the Year award. 

Discussing his self-titled album, Michael said: 'My name means a lot to me, it's my heritage and who I am. And that's something I want to be loud and proud about.' 

While speaking about his impressive win, the singer also revealed that he's often felt a little bit of 'imposter syndrome' in the past.

Album: The judges called Michael's album (cover pictured) a 'masterpiece' filled with 'hot button topics like race and identity'

He explained that this has: 'Taken things away from my dream job, so I made the decision when making this album to really show myself and be as clear as I can be.

And turning his attention to the future, Mercury prize winner Michael said that he wants to continue creating.

He said: 'I hope to continue making records, albums, and making music which can connect with as many people as possible. Hopefully this is an award that can do that... and will be music that can help people through their day.'

During his interview Michael was asked what his name means, leaving him a little bit flustered as he joked: 'I don't know what it means! Someone's got to Google it.. my cousin's going to be "like what!?" after this'  

The big reveal: Annie Mac told Micheal that he had won the coveted award, leaving him speechless

Exciting: Michael said it was a 'dream come true' to win the award, something which he has always wanted to do

The judging panel said Kiwanuka was 'the well deserved winner' and praised the record for being its thoughtful and timely content. 

They said: 'Classic yet contemporary, drawing on the history of music while remaining an intensely personal work of self expression, this is an album that will stand the test of time. 

'Songs such as Hero and You Ain't The Problem deal with hot button topics like race and identity, but in a reflective way that draws the listener in.'

They continued: 'From its narrative flow to the interludes, from Civil Rights speeches to its panoramic mix of everything from psychedelic rock to piano jazz, Kiwanuka is not only a complete work, but also one that is borne of the courage of its creator to build his own world and invite us in. 

Three cheers: Alex Jones and Amol Rajan clapped for the winner and said he would be a great 'role model' for lots of young musicians 

'Warm, rich, hugely accomplished and belonging to no one genre but its own, Kiwanuka is a masterpiece.' 

Thursday night's announcement was the first time the winner has been announced live on The One Show, with Radio 1's Annie Mac delivering the news.

The award ceremony is usually a glamorous affair hosted by Hyundai in London, but due to coronavirus, Annie, 42, will deliver the judges' verdict live on air instead.
