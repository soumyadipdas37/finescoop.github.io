Notorious germaphobe Howie Mandel gagged when watching a contestant spit up a toy duck on Tuesday's semifinals episode of America's Got Talent.

Brett Loudermilk, a 31-year-old street performer from North Carolina, swore that he had swallowed the item in childhood, and brought along an endoscopic camera to prove it.

Howie, 64, stood above him wearing black gloves and a black mask with a face shield, and slowly lowered the camera down into Brett's throat.

After everyone got a good look at the toy on camera, Brett regurgitated it, saying, 'My child!'

He tried to offer it to Howie, saying, 'That's been in me for 20 years, Howie, keep this!'

Howie pulled away, yelping, 'I don't want it!' as Brett pointed out, 'You're wearing gloves!'

After Howie gestured to Brett to set the duck down, the comedian strode quickly offstage.

New judge Sofia Vergara, 48, gave Brett the side-eye, telling him, 'That was the most unnecessary thing. It's like, ''What just happened in front of us?''

'You got a glimpse no one's ever seen before,' Brett cheerily replied.

'But we didn't want to see that,' Sofia said. 'You've gone crazier and crazier with this act, but this one, I don't even know what to say. Ask Howie, he talks a lot. Because I can't say anything.'

Asked what he thought, Howie said, 'I'm gonna be totally honest. I don't know if I loved it.'

He then corrected himself, saying, 'I didn't love it,' as AGT viewers on a giant TV screen booed him.

'I get it,' Brett said. 'You're a germaphobe, there's a pandemic, I understand.'

Generous offer: Brett tried to offer the toy duck to Howie, saying, 'That's been in me for 20 years, Howie, keep this!'

Howie acknowledged he was right, but wondered, 'If you go through, what's next? How do you top that? With your bottom?'

Heidi Klum, 47, could only add: 'You got to be ducking kidding me with that one!'

Just five acts of the 11 appearing on Tuesday's show will go through to AGT's finals next week, which would give them a shot at a $1 million prize.

Good one: Heidi Klum, 47, could only add: 'You got to be ducking kidding me with that one!'

The W.A.F.F.L.E. Crew from New York City kicked the show off in spectacular fashion, dancing to Joe Budden's Pump It Up in a warehouse on the Universal Studios lot.

'We can always count on you guys to lift our spirit and lift our energy,' said Heidi, as the other judges agreed that Simon Cowell's Golden Buzzer act had been fantastic. 

Kenadi Dodds, a 15-year-old singer from North Logan, Utah, next covered Thomas Rhett's Be A Light, and made a fan of Howie, who'd been unimpressed during the quarterfinals.

Oddly, when Max had Heidi toss a ball into a roulette wheel, it landed on 13, which was the same number Max had printed on a billboard at Universal CityWalk Hollywood.

Howie and Sofia proclaimed themselves confused by Max's act, but Heidi asked them, 'What are you not getting?' and reflected that as Max's assistant, she was 'terrific!'

He rode a zipline by clenching his teeth around a pulley that was lit on fire. Midway, he had to free his bound hands and undo a combination lock to keep going safely.

The ropes above Jonathan's head fell into flames around him, and he barely made it through and across before collapsing onto a platform, his nose smudged with ash.

'You have to be a little cuckoo in the head to do this thing,' a shaken Sofia said. 'This is not like a trick or an illusion; he's actually doing these insane things to himself.'

Many choir members had been homeless, and in a pre-taped video they thanked founder Stephanie Johnson, who cried when her mom said how proud she was.

Howie called Steph a 'hero,' and said, 'We've never had that kind of gravitas on this stage, where there's a message everybody needs to hear and do something about.'

The last act of the evening was 14-year-old singer Daneliya Tuleshova from Kazakhstan, who sounded like a veteran rockstar with her cover of Jessie J's Who You Are.
