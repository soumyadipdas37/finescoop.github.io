Temperatures are set to plummet across Australia's south-east in the coming days as  a low pressure system lashes the region and brings heavy rain, damaging winds and snow.  

Adelaide will cop a soaking on Thursday with up to 15mm rain forecast, followed by a top of 13C on Friday - the city's coldest spring day since 1997.

Melburnians should also keep their umbrellas handy with up to 20mm of rain and a top of just 12C tipped on Friday, which would be its chilliest September day in 20 years.

'Local hail, with isolated thunderstorms in the morning and afternoon. Heavy falls possible about the nearby hills,' the Bureau of Meteorology forecast for Melbourne states.

The miserable conditions will continue into the weekend with a top of 13C on Saturday and 14C on Sunday.

It will be a slightly warmer weekend in Adelaide with maximums of 15C and 18C on Saturday and Sunday respectively.

A complex low system will see temperatures in the nation's south-east south plummet up to 10 below average, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

The extreme cold front about to hit is rare for this time of the year.

'It's rare to see it this late in the year,' Weatherzone meteorologist Ben Domensino told Yahoo News Australia.

'It's an interesting system but it also could be a dangerous weather event.'

'We could see damaging winds, thunderstorms and hail so check for warnings in your area.'

Low-lying snow is expected to Tasmania, southern and central NSW, the ACT, and Victoria around 700-800 metres above sea level on Friday into Saturday. 

The mainland alpine areas are also expected to get a dusting. 

Tasmania will also feel the force of the rare cold front.

'Cooler conditions and showers with a series of fronts and troughs to end the week for Tasmania. Snowfalls to around 700m in the west and south, and to around 900m elsewhere,' BOM tweeted.

In the ACT,  Canberra can expect showers and a top of just 11 on Friday.

Over in the west, temperatures in Perth will plummet in the coming days from 31C on Thursday down to 24C on Friday and a wet 21C forecast for the weekend.

Much of NSW will be unaffected by the extreme cold front.
