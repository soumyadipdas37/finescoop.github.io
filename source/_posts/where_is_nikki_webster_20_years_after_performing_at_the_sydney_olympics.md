Nikki Webster stole the hearts of the world as a performer at the 2000 Sydney Olympics when she was just 13.

Here's what the 33-year-old Australian singer has been up to in the two decades since her rise to fame in 2000.

Nikki appeared to have barely aged a day in the video cross with anchor Karl Stefanovic and fill-in co-host Deborah Knight.

Reflecting on her stardom as a teenager, she said: 'There was no written book on how to do it right. We just kind of went with it. Took the experience for what it was and that.'

Nikki added: 'I got to be immersed with so many different people from around the world, I got to make music and clothing ranges and do so much.'   

In 2001, Nikki released the chart-topping single Strawberry Kisses, and in 2005 had her own range of clothing sold at Kmart.

This week to mark the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Olympics, Nikki posed with the pink floral dress she wore on stage at the opening ceremony.

She joked that while she no longer fits the dress, her young daughter Skylah, five, now does.

Nikki is the proud mother to Skylah, and son Malachi, two. Following in the footsteps of her famous mother, Skylah is regularly seen on Instagram singing and dancing.

Last year, news came to light that Nikki's former partner, Matthew McMah, had been charged with assaulting her. 

McMah was convicted of common assault domestic violence and fined $800 in July, The Daily Telegraph reported on November 2, 2019.

The pair had been together for seven years, but it was revealed Nikki had quietly split with McMah earlier in the year.

McMah, who is understood to work in the aviation industry, proposed to Webster after two-and-a-half years of dating during a romantic holiday to Fiji in 2010.

They were married since 2012, although it's unclear when their relationship broke down.

While Nikki's rise to fame was fast, she also faded quickly from the spotlight in the early 2000s, before re-emerging as a dance teacher a decade later.

In 2010, she founded her own teaching academy: Dance Nikki Webster.

The singer now owns three New South Wales dance studios - in Leichardt, Minchinbury, and Erina on the Central Coast. 

Most recently, Nikki was unveiled as the Alien on the inaugural season of The Masked Singer Australia in 2019.

She was the first mystery celebrity to be unmasked on the series.

The mother-of-two released her last single in 2009, but mentioned this week that there is a new album in the works.

On Monday, Nikki revealed fans can expect to be hearing more of her music soon.

Speaking to Nova's The Babble, Nikki said: 'I have recorded music, I've recorded a whole album that I love and it's great fun, but I just haven't released it yet.'
