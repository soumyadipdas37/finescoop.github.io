Casey, who is a qualified yoga teacher, showed off her lean physique in the skimpy two-piece.

The mother-of-two opted for comfort on her feet with pale blue trainers and tied her hair up in a high ponytail. 

Ahead of the workout, Casey sat on a bench to take a phone call.

The Celebrity Big Brother star unveiled her impressive weight loss in jaw-dropping before-and-after photos recently, having undergone a 90-day transformation.  

She posted a snap of the impressive fitness overhaul alongside the caption: 'A little bit proud of myself guys! Not bad for reaching this goal after being stretched twice, having two babies in two years.

'Here’s my 90 Day Challenge results and I’ve managed to lose 2 stone in 3 months. Last time it was 4 stone in 6 months so am thrilled to be losing at the same rate as last time, even though I’ve had cheat meals and even a whole week off!

'Am moving on to Bikini Blitz next so will let you know how I get on.'

The reality star announced the happy news that she had given birth to her second child, daughter Sadie, with fiancé Dane Goodson on January 26.

She originally announced she was pregnant with her second child in July, 14 months after welcoming first daughter Florence into the world.

The yoga instructor said although she and salesman fiancé Dane wanted to expand their family, they weren't prepared for how quickly it would happen.
