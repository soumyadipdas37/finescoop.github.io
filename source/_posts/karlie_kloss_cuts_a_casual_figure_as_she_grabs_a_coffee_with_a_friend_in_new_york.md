She is one of the fashion industry's most well-known supermodels.

And Karlie Kloss opted for a low-key figure as she stepped out for a stroll with a friend in New York City on Sunday.

The model, 28, donned a white jacket and a matching vest for the outing along with a pair of black leggings.

Karlie also sported a pair of black trainers and put safety first as she wore a matching face mask while running errands.

Styling her blonde locks into a ponytail, the beauty also wore a black cap and a pair of small gold earrings.

Grabbing a cup of coffee for her stroll, the model completed her look with a small bejewelled necklace.   

Karlie celebrated her latest birthday this August 3 and marked the occasion with a YouTube video listing 28 Things I've Learned In 28 Years.

She urged fans to 'show up at the polls because we all deserve change this November' despite the fact she is related to the incumbent U.S. President.

The blonde bombshell has publicly expressed her political disagreements with the the First Family on multiple occasions.

She announced this January that she voted 'as a Democrat in 2016' and clarified that she 'plans to do the same thing in 2020.'

Karlie has also repeatedly posted in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, although critics like former Rookie editor Tavi Gevinson have slammed her as a hypocrite because she has not publicly denounced her family vociferously enough.

Investigative reporter Vicky Ward's book Kushner, Inc. aired out a raft of gossip about Karlie and Josh's romance - and his family's opposition to the match.

Jared and his parents Charlie and Seryl objected to Karlie's being a 'shiksa' who, unlike former Gentile Ivanka, did not come from a powerful family.

Karlie's lack of Ivanka's Ivy League education also rankled with the Kushner family, whose inner circle derisively referred to Josh's girlfriend as 'the lingerie model.'

The night of U.S. President Donald Trump's inaugural ball, the Kushners held a Sabbath dinner where Charlie warned Josh off Karlie in front of other guests.

Although Josh's parents avoided coming face-to-face with her for six years after she began dating their son, Karlie was evidently bent on impressing them.

She took to Orthodox Judaism with such brio that she went on foot to Barry Diller's Oscar party one year, owing to restrictions on operating a car during the Sabbath.

Throwback: Karlie is married to Joshua Kushner, the brother of Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner; the couple are pictured in New York last October
