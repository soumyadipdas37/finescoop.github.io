Nine-time Grammy winner Mary J. Blige recalled the first time she met The Notorious B.I.G. in a recording studio when he was laying down his verse for her 1993 album What's the 411? Remix.

'He was sweet and fun,' the 49-year-old Queen of Hip Hop Soul said during Tuesday's episode of No Filter with Naomi Campbell.

'He was in the studio [leaning] on the wall, smoking, and quiet...When he came out [of the studio], he was like, "You feeling that, Mom?" [I was] like, "Yeah, of course I'm feeling that! Crazy!" He was always humble, and quiet, and sweet. And fun, just a lot of fun.' 

'He was sweet and fun!' Nine-time Grammy winner Mary J. Blige recalled the first time she met The Notorious B.I.G. (R) in a recording studio when he was laying down his verse for her 1993 album What's the 411? Remix

The four-time Grammy nominee (born Christopher Wallace) was tragically murdered, age 24, in a drive-by shooting back in 1997.

Mary still considers Biggie Smalls' ex-girlfriend Lil' Kim as well as his Bad Boy Records boss Sean 'Diddy' Combs like family.

'Yes, Kim is still my little baby sister. That's my baby, my heart,' Blige gushed.

'Puff has been in my life since the beginning of my career. We were working on What's the 411 together. He was the A&R for my first album. He was already my brother and my family by the time I got the My Life album.'

The Bronx-born R&B belter recounted how she was discovered by Uptown Records founder Andre Harrell in 1989 after hearing her cover of Anita Baker's 1986 song Caught Up in the Rapture she recorded at Galleria White Plains.

'[Andre] was like, "Oh my God, you're a star!"' said Mary, who got a house call from Harrell.

'He told my mother, "Your daughter is going to sing for royalty one day." He came to my hood, and heard this young girl sing, and gave me a chance, and everything else was history.'
