 Chinese authorities have confirmed the criminal detention of 12 Hong Kongers who were allegedly attempting to travel illegally to Taiwan by boat last month, while the foreign ministry in Beijing labelled the group separatists.

The 12 people, aged 16 to 33, were put under 'compulsory criminal detention' on August 23 for illegally crossing the border, according to a statement Sunday from the public security bureau in Shenzhen of southern China.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Tuesday claimed that the 12 people arrested at sea by mainland authorities were not 'democratic activists being oppressed'.

Lam's comments come after relatives of some of the detainees held a news conference on Saturday to demand their urgent return. 

The families pleaded for them to be allowed to call home and consult lawyers appointed by the families and not the Chinese government. 

Hours before the conference, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was deeply concerned about the activists, noting they had been denied access to lawyers. 

The statement from Chinese authorities was the first formal announcement that the 12 would likely face criminal charges. 

The 12 were believed to be travelling to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, a popular choice among protesters who have chosen to leave Hong Kong since the passage of a new national security law in June. 

Critics say the Hong Kong law is Beijing's clearest attempt to erase the legal firewall between the semi-autonomous territory and the mainland´s authoritarian Communist Party system.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Friday that the US is 'deeply concerned' over the arrests of the 12 people, whom he called 'democracy activists.'

US State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a Twitter post Saturday that the arrest of the 12 is 'another sad example of the deterioration of human rights in Hong Kong.'

'Legitimate governments do not need to wall their countries in and prevent their citizens from leaving,' Ortagus wrote.

Beijing foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Sunday on Twitter that the 12 detained were not 'democratic activists, but elements attempting to separate #HongKong from China.'

Under Hong Kong's security law, attempting to separate Hong Kong from China is illegal, as the law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces in the city's internal affairs.

Hong Kong's Security Bureau said on Monday all 12 were suspected of committing crimes in Hong Kong.

Ten of them had been charged with offences such as manufacturing or possessing explosives, arson, rioting, assaulting police or possession of offensive weapons. Those 10 had been on bail and not allowed to leave Hong Kong, it said.

One was suspected of colluding with foreign forces under a national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in June. The law allows for the punishment of anything China considers to be subversion, separatism, terrorism or such collusion.

Speaking at her regular weekly news conference, Lam reiterated that the 12 will have to face justice in the mainland and that her government will provide them and their families with the 'needed and feasible' assistance.

'The reason for them leaving Hong Kong seems to be that they were running away from legal responsibility,' Lam said.

'I want to set the record straight, because certain local and overseas individuals tried to shift the attention, describing them as democratic (activists) being oppressed.'

Asked about whether it was appropriate label them as 'separatists' given they are yet to face trial, Lam said she saw 'no particular value' in debating the issue.

Pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu expressed concern in a interview with public broadcaster RTHK on Monday that the 12 could face more severe charges in the future, which could result in longer prison sentences. They are currently accused of illegally crossing the border and not separatism.

The relatives of the arrested Hong Kongers held a news conference on Saturday calling for the return of their family members to Hong Kong, saying their legal rights were being violated.

The relatives, who wore masks and sunglasses and did not not reveal their names, said those arrested should be allowed to meet with lawyers they themselves have hired, not those appointed by Chinese authorities. They also said they should be provided with needed medications and be allowed to call their families.

In a statement released at the news conference, the families said that the Hong Kong government had not yet provided any sort of concrete assistance to the families.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said last week that the group arrested would have to be dealt with according to Chinese laws if they were arrested for committing an offence in China. She said that the Hong Kong government would try and render assistance.
