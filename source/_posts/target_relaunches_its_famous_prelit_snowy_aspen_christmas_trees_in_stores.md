Target Australia has re-released its pre-lit snowy aspen Christmas tree (pictured)

With three months left until the big day, Target Australia has re-released its pre-lit Snowy Aspen Christmas tree.

But the $149 artificial tree is so popular it has already sold out online and in stores.

The seven-foot product has stunning flocked branches with build-in lights that illuminate the gorgeous white wintery finish to the tree.

One shopper who was eager to get the tree up shared an image of the product to a popular Facebook group.

'Amazing how putting up a tree can change your mood and what a better year to do it early,' Kellie said.

'This is the 7ft pre-lit Snowy Aspen $149 from Target, not to be confused with the Snowy Alaskan which Target have also brought out this year.'

The lights also make the tree look so gorgeous some may choose to not add ornaments. 

On the Target website, the Christmas tree has an average star rating of 4.2 out of five and many happy customers have praised the product online.

'Love this snowy tree, so pretty, fills the house with Christmas joy,' one person said.

'This tree is beautiful, [I'm] in love and cannot believe how pretty it is. I was lucky enough to find one and I'm grateful I did!' another said.

'You don't need to put any ornaments on it - it's soo pretty,' another said.  

In previous years the tree has been just as popular among customers, with hundreds of Target stores running out of stock. 

The product differs from other Christmas trees on the market due to its wintery style that catches the eye. 

Dressed up with bright baubles and tinsel it looks like something the royal family might place in their lounge room, so competition is fierce. 

In 2018, customers were posting callouts for the humble tree in their local area on Facebook and even calling the head office for information about launch dates.

'If anyone is still looking for the Snowy Aspen tree there is one left on the Target eBay store right now so get in quick,' one mother announced in the private group.

'Who else is going crazy trying to get a Snowy Aspen?' Another despaired at the same time. 

Although the product is currently out of stock, customers can choose from a range of different Christmas trees from Target. It is likely to be restocked again before Christmas.
