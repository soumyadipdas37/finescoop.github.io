She urged her fans and followers to register to vote ahead of the November election earlier in the day on Instagram.

And Sofia Richie kept the message going later as she stopped at a gas station in Los Angeles while wearing a charcoal 'Voter' T-shirt.

The 22-year-old model shared her civic-minded message while filling up her SUV.

Sofia had her dark gray shirt tucked into her black high-waisted jeans, which emphasized her hourglass figure.

She lightened up her dark ensemble a bit with a set of brilliant white platform boots that had a zipper running down the front.

The daughter of Lionel Richie had her long dirty blonde tresses tied back in a high ponytail that draped down her back.

The 5ft6in model covered her face with a leopard print cloth mask to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, and she also put on clear gloves while handling the pump.

Earlier in the day, she showed off the same outfit from a stone balcony outdoors in honor of National Voter Registration Day.

Sofia pulled her shirt at the collar to emphasize its message while also wearing a chunky pair of cat-eye sunglasses. 

'Happy national voter registration day,' she wrote. 'THE REAL POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS… VOTE! Please register.'

Though her post was non-partisan, the comments were quickly inundated with nearly identical posts saying, 'Trump 2020.'

The ex-girlfriend of Scott Disick also posted links to multiple organizations that help voters register in her Instagram Stories.

On Monday, Sofia met up with her older  sister Nicole Richie to celebrate her 39th birthday.

She shared a hilarious video of the former reality star rocking out to music and pumping her fists while dancing on a sofa outside.

Her daughter Harlow, 12, sat between her legs and her son Sparrow, 11, stood off to the side, and both looked visibly embarrassed at their mother having a good time, while Sofia chuckled from behind the camera.

'My mood for life,' she wrote while tagging Nicole.

A mirror selfie she also posted to her Instagram Stories featured the two sisters cuddling up with each other.

'Happy Birthday to my sis/ soul mate/ best friend. I love you too much!' she captioned the snap.

Also on Monday, Sofia shared a photo of herself looking chic in a brown suit with a black tank top.

'Rosh Hashanah gave me an excuse to put on an outfit,' she captioned the sultry photo.

But her ex Scott Disick also took the opportunity to comment on the picture, writing 'Shanah tovah umetukah,' a common greeting during Rosh Hashanah which in Hebrew means 'good and sweet year.'

Hello: It didn't take much time for her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick to send his well-wishes despite not following Richie on social media

Scott and Sofia's relationship began in 2017, but the couple separated in May of this year following the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star's short stay in a rehab facility.

The couple seemed to have reunited over the summer after spending time together on the Fourth of July, but the relationship ended shortly afterward.

More recently, Scott has been spending time with his ex Kourtney and their children.
