She's expecting her first baby early next year.

And Dani Dyer has confessed that while she loves being pregnant, she's constantly worrying about the health of her baby.

Posting on Instagram on Tuesday, the Love Island star admitted she spent her whole first trimester on the phone to her doctor for reassurance and since being diagnosed with an anterior placenta, her worries have only increased.

Expecting: Dani Dyer has confessed that while she loves being pregnant, she's constantly worrying about the health of her baby

Sharing a photo of herself in a tight lilac co-ord to show off her bump, Dani wrote: 'Being a first time mum is such an amazing experience but also a worrying one. I find it crazy how I can love something so much that isn’t even here yet and all I want to do is look after it!'

'Social media can paint a picture that being pregnant is so easy but the reality is it can be really tiring and hard sometimes. I've suffered from severe migraines, tiredness and I started going off so many foods when I first fell pregnant,' she continued.

Dani recently revealed that she has an anterior placenta - when the placenta attaches to the front wall of the uterus.

The reality star explained she was worried she 'wouldn’t be able to feel my baby move,' because of the condition, but she got reassurance from other mums and mums-to-be. 

Worries: Posting on Instagram on Tuesday, the Love Island star admitted she spent her whole first trimester on the phone to her doctor for reassurance

'This is when I got recommended to join the @peanut app, and it changed everything,' she wrote. 'Seeing women going through the same worries as me really made me feel more relaxed and understand that it’s normal to feel how I’m feeling.'

'The mums on the app gave me loads of tips, like laying on your side to help you feel more so the baby can kick against that rather than where the placenta is. I absolutely love being pregnant but it’s a constant battle of wanting everything to be perfect and for my baby to be healthy.'

Dani continued by admitting she's sure she'll find more to worry about when she enters the final trimester in the next couple of weeks. 





Tricky time: Dani explained in her candid caption that since being diagnosed with an anterior placenta, her worries have only increased

'A lot of people say the second trimester is the best, and I can agree it’s a lot better than the first as I spent the first 12 weeks always on the phone to my doctor,' she confessed.

'I'm always finding new things to worry about, so I'm really relieved to have an app where I can go to ask questions and get advice.'

'I can’t imagine what new worries will come my way during the third trimester. You really do go through a whirlwind of emotions and the women on the app have helped me learn that it’s okay if I’m having a bad day.'

Glowing: The reality star, 24, is pregnant with her first child with beau Sammy Kimmence 

'We are all going through this crazy experience together and it’s nice to share how we are all feeling the good and the bad.'

In July the reality star announced she was expecting her first child with boyfriend Sammy Kimmence - just three months after they rekindled their relationship. 

'Little bubba can't believe you are going to be ours,' she wrote, 'Me and Sammy are so excited to start this next chapter in our lives, feel so lucky and grateful...2021.' 

 Dani also recently said that she has started to 'embrace' the changes in her body.

She wrote: 'I've really started noticing the changes in my body and I'm definitely embracing it.
