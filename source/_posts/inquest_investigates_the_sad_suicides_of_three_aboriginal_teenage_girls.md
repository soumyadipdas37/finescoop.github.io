Grieving families may never get the answers they need after three teenage Aboriginal girls died in apparent 'suicides' in the space of a year. 

A coronial inquest into the deaths of Layla 'Gulum' Leering, 15, Keturah Cheralyn Mamarika, 16, and Fionica James, 17, began in Darwin on Wednesday.

All three girls were raped, one allegedly by three boys at once, at some point in their lives before killing themselves by hanging in 2016 and 2017.

Investigations were so bungled by police that Coroner Greg Cavanagh warned families the whole truth about their deaths may never be known.

Keturah was the first of the trio to die, found by her mother hanging from a ceiling fan in her family's home on the remote Groote Eyland island about 9am.

The body of 'Gulum' Leering, 15, (pictured) was found under a tree in December 2017, after she got drunk and a 15-year-old boy admitted to taking advantage of her

Just two hours earlier she was preening her hair and posting selfies to social media until her family went out. That was when she allegedly took her own life.

Post-mortem examinations found she had once been gang raped by three boys and the court heard she became sexually active at 12, the NT News reported.

Alex Ngalmi, her sister Jesselyn Mamarika partner, called Keturah his 'young wife' but denied having sex with her.

'I wasn't there when she passed away, I was in town,' he told police, having left at 7am along with Jesselyn.

Keturah's family cleaned the room where she died with bleach and a high-pressure hose the next day, and burned several items of furniture.

Layla died next, her body found under a tree in Bulla, near the Western Australian border, in December 2017.

She had vaginal injuries and 'plant material and debris was on her back, beneath her bra and T-shirt, between her buttocks and ­protruding from her anus'.

The inquest heard Layla was drunk the night she died and argued with her relative Jeremiah Laurie over a bottle of Jim Beam.

After initially lying to police, Adrian Davey, 15, admitted he took advantage of the 'drunk, maybe too drunk' teenager, but denied forcing her to have sex with him.

Her mother Justine Jingles (pictured) showed up to the inquest at Darwin Local Court, saying she wouldn't rest until she knew what happened in the girl's last hours

Layla had a long history of petty crimes and her family refused to take her back when she was found wandering the streets of Katherine in 2014, and she was put in care.

However, her mother Justine Jingles showed up to the inquest at Darwin Local Court with her other daughters Jasmine and Keely Jingles.

'I really wanted to know how she spent her last hours alive. It was so much for me to handle, it's starting to process in my mind now and I'm waking up to reality,' she said.

'Me and my girls now we just would like to know about the truth — what really happened, because I won't rest until I find out.'

Fionica had a turbulent upbringing as her parents struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, and was regularly treated for STDs from age 13.

Her boyfriend Alvester Gurruwiwi told the inquest their relationship was marred by family feuds, threats of violence and jealousy. 

He claimed she was so badly beaten by her aunt in 2016 when her family discovered that she was pregnant that she lost the baby.

The stress of this episode led to Alvester unsuccessfully attempting suicide by hanging himself from a tree.

Fionica was treated for numerous injuries in the months before her death and it was suspected she was a victim of domestic violence - though it wasn't clear by whom.

On Christmas Day 2017, she found text's on Alvester's phone from another woman, causing an argument that led to her moving back with her father.

Alvester came to her home carrying a makeshift spear and vowed there would be 'war' if she didn't come back with him, so she did.

Layla's sister Jasmine Jingles was also at the inquest alongside her mother on Wednesday

Fionica was the next morning found dead, hanging from the same tree her boyfriend tried to kill himself on a year earlier.

Detective Superintendent Lauren Hill reviewed each of the investigations and found major shortcomings.

'The superintendent, in her thorough and explicit report, has pulled no punches in her several criticisms of the level of the standard of these investigations, which has precluded, in my view, me from being able to get to the full truth of any of these three deaths,' Mr Cavanagh told the inquest. 

The inquest heard the Darwin major crimes unit had heavy turnover at the time, leading to the investigations changing hands many times.

Superintendent Hill's report said detectives failed to adequately collect evidence and contaminated at least one DNA sample.

The inquest continues on Thursday.
