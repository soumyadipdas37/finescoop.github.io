Two best friends who live in different states made more than a million dollars selling infrared sauna blankets during coronavirus lockdown.

Melbourne-based Ed Hodge, 26, and Brisbane-based Wyatt Westmoreland, 23, launched E-commerce business MiHIGH in May after a successful test run in April. 

In just four months, the young businessmen reached one million dollars in revenue - despite not being able to see each other due to border closures brought on by a deadly second wave of COVID-19 infections in Melbourne.

'The only downside to the success is we have we haven't been able to share it together,' Mr Westmoreland told Daily Mail Australia.

The blankets - which can burn up to 600 calories in 45 minutes - allow users to enjoy the benefits of an infrared sauna in the comfort of their own home.

The best mates, who have backgrounds in E-commerce and marketing, always knew they wanted to run a business together. 

Passionate about the health and wellness space, the pair spent the past couple of years conducting research and learning about what 'works' with consumers.

Mr Westmoreland came up with their breakthrough business idea as he sat in an infrared sauna. 

He quickly texted Mr Hodge and suggested the pair looking into 'portable' infrared sauna blankets. 

'We did a bit of research and it fit the criteria,' Mr Hodge said. 

MiHIGH was officially launched in Australia and the UK in May following a test run in April. The blankets hit the US market in June.

'In the beginning, it was scary,' Mr Westmoreland said. 

'Everyone was uncertain as to what would happen.'

But the pair quickly learnt lockdown was a blessing in disguise for their venture, with Australians unable to visit wellness centres and encouraged to stay at home. 

'By the time we were fully launched, we realised we couldn't have launched a better product at a better time,' Mr Westmoreland said.

'It was perfect.' 

MiHIGH hit $1million in August after making $200,000 in both May and June and $400,000 in July.

The revenue is now heading towards $1.5million and the pair hope to make $5million within one year of trading. 

They are also looking to expand and hope to launch more brands within the health and wellness space. 

The two business partners haven't seen each other since March but have been able to work efficiently with 'good online systems', 'years of experience in E-commerce', 'constant communication' and by holding each other accountable.  

'Last time we saw each other would have been early March. I was in Brisbane staying at Wyatt's,' Mr Hodge said.

'Coronavirus started coming and I went back to Melbourne.

'We haven't seen each other since we launched.'

Mr Hodge admitted Melbourne's Stage Four coronavirus lockdown had been tough despite having a successful business and being able to work online.

There are three core benefits for using MiHIGH: 'Detoxify', 'Calm Your Mind' and 'Burn Calories'

There are three core benefits for using MiHIGH: 'Detoxify', 'Calm Your Mind' and 'Burn Calories'.

The infrared heat allows users to sweat out both water and toxins, providing an effective detox.

The blankets mean users can 'work out, without working out', as studies have shown that infrared saunas can burn anywhere from 200 to 600 calories per session.   

'The third and final benefit is calming the body and the mind,' Mr Westmoreland said. 

'The heat can really relax your muscles. Good for recovery. The 40 minutes in the blanket is a good time to relax.'  

The MiHIGH website reads: 'From celebrities to global sports stars, infrared saunas are being praised for their benefits on body and mind. 

'MiHIGH's infrared blanket brings all of these benefits directly to your home.'
