DIET DELIVERY BOX

Last January, my husband and I signed up to a food delivery service, Mindful Chef. It's low carb and gluten free. 

I've lost 5lb and it's so tasty that we haven't stopped. We use it for four meals, which in total costs £63 a week, and they take only 15 minutes to cook. (mindfulchef.com).

SMILE REBOOT

Six years ago, I found out I had such bad gum disease, due to a genetic condition, that I needed all my teeth out. 

It was heart-breaking and traumatic, as I was only 44. I had to wear dentures and looked about 80! Then I got implants. They cost £30,000 but were so worth it.

COUPLES CYCLING

My husband and I got into cycling during lockdown. We do 15 to 18 miles after work on week nights. 

Then another 25 to 30 on the weekend (about three hours). It was a great way to spend quality time together. 

Now, I've started going back to the gym, too, for HIIT sessions, three times a week (£67 per month, ultimatewarriortraining.com).

BUDGET SKINCARE

Before lockdown, I used Elemis skincare as I get a wonderful facial every six months which uses their products (£70, headtotoetherapy.co.uk). 

However, I couldn't buy them when the salon shut, so I started using Restore Day and Night Cream (both £14, marksandspencer.com). 

They're so much cheaper and I can't say I notice a difference. I've kept using Elemis Nourishing Omega Rich Cleansing Oil (£32.50, elemis.com) though.

CHISELLED CHEEKBONES

I've never had Botox. Instead, I use Iconic London's Sheer Blush (£18, iconiclondoninc.com). 

It's a tube of dewy pink cream, which gives your face an instant lift and glow. It doesn't sit in fine lines, like powders do. 

I put it on my cheeks and lips, too. My husband often says I have good cheekbones!
