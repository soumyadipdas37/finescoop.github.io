Despite breaking up more than a decade ago, Powderfinger remain one of Australia's most popular bands.

But fans hoping for a reunion will be disappointed as it's revealed the beloved rockers won't be headlining the AFL Grand Finale in Brisbane next month.

The group have declined promoter Michael Gudinski's 'generous' offer to perform at the Gabba, despite being tipped to play the anticipated historic event.

'We are extremely flattered to have been asked to perform at the Gabba AFL GF,' they wrote in a statement shared to their Twitter account on Saturday. 

'A very generous and enticing proposal made by Mr Gudinski and the AFL board (thanks ladies & gents) but it is not to be this time folks.

'We'd rather make way for active Queensland artists,' they added before suggesting the likes of locals Amy Shark, Busby Marou, Thelma Plum and Violent Soho to perform instead.

The My Happiness rockers didn't however rule out attending the final from the stand.

'Might see some of you at the Gabba Oct 24 but we will just have a beer and a pie in hand not guitars. Love Yez, PF'.

Back In May, the Aussie rockers fueled speculation they would reunite after 350,000 viewers streamed the band's 'one night only' show.

The rockers, including frontman Bernard Fanning join bandmates Darren Middleton, Jon Coghill, John Collins and Ian Haug, had reunited for the first time since splitting in 2010, to take part in an online streaming event to help Australia's struggling music industry during the coronavirus pandemic. 

The event raised more than $427,000 and was donated to Support Act along with Beyond Blue, who support those with mental health struggles.

Following the concert, frontman Bernard, 50, told the Daily Telegraph he was pleased they still had their unique sound.

'One thing I will say about it is there is no one making music that sounds like us at the moment so hopefully the concert creates a point of difference and can contribute to the re-emergence of people playing instruments,' he told the paper.  

'I see that at my own shows, younger people in the audience requesting Powderfinger songs,' he said.   

'An interesting part of this (live performance) is that it opens it up to a whole lot of new people.' 

Powderfinger split in November 2010, after playing their final show in Brisbane.
