In addition to Daisy, Olivia and her fiance share son Otis, six, together.

Olivia and Jason have been engaged for seven years and together for a total of nine.

Jason recently revealed he waited to kiss Olivia for the first time because he had a feeling she was going to be the last person he ever smooched.

The actor was asked by All Access' Sibley Scoles if it was 'fact or fiction' that he waited 'one month to text Olivia for a date, and on the fourth date there was no kiss.'

 'The majority of that is fact, yes. It might be five weeks or three weeks, but that's fact, yeah,' the Horrible Bosses star replied. 

He admitted that he 'took my sweet time,' adding, 'I just had a hunch that the second I kissed her, I wasn't gonna end up ever kissing anyone again, so I had to be careful with it.'
