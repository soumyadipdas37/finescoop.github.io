Dr Trisha Stratford has confirmed that she has parted ways from Married At First Sight after seven seasons.

Daily Mail Australia first reported the news on Tuesday and revealed that producers have decided to shake things up by introducing a 'sex therapist' on the expert panel for the next season.

In a statement on the show's Instagram account on Wednesday, the relationship expert announced she was 'taking a step back from the series to focus on her writing, research and neuropsychotherapy'.

In response to her resignation from the role, a statement from the MAFS team read: All our thanks to Trisha for the extraordinary contribution she has made to the success of #MAFS! ❤️.'

A production insider told Daily Mail Australia that the New Zealand based therapist was notably missing during the second and third stages of castings last week.

Instead, participants were introduced to an 'American female sex therapist' who asked each of the stars what they were hoping to find in a match.

For the first time, the show's relationship experts will be forced to meet the loved-up hopefuls via Zoom due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier this year angry fans expressed outrage over the role, or lack thereof, Trisha, and fellow experts John Aiken, Mel Schilling played in the 2020 season. 

Many were perplexed by the shortage of advice the trio gave to the struggling couples and 'dud' pairings.

Trisha doesn't fare much better when it comes to interviewing the participants in previous seasons.

In the past she has often asked one or two questions, usually about sex, before letting John and Mel take over the conversation.

Earlier this month, it was revealed producers have decided not to cast any Victorians this season after the state recorded a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Nine for comment.

 

 

What happened? In recent seasons, John and Mel have dominated discussions at the dinner parties and commitment ceremonies while Trisha would sit in relative silence
