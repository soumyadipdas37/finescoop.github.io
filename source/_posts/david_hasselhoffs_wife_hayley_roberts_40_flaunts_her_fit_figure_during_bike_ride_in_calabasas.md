She was catapulted into the spotlight when she began dating Baywatch legend David Hasselhoff nine years ago. 

And, Hayley Roberts, 40, flaunted her fit figure in a crop top and skin-tight leggings during bike ride in Calabasas, California on Monday. 

The Welsh model looked sensational as she enjoyed her cycle, with her washboard abs on show, with safety at the forefront of her bike ride as she wore a helmet.

Hayley teamed light grey leggings with a black-and-white floral sports bra and plain white trainers, while hanging a facemask around her neck.

The Welsh beauty opted to go it alone as she headed out for her exercise regimen without her husband. 

The couple have been married since 2018, when they had a romantic and lavish ceremony in Puglia, Italy.

 They met back in 2011, when Hasselhoff was working as a judge on Britain's Got Talent.

While in Cardiff, Wales for auditions, the former Baywatch star strolled into a store and was approached for a picture by Roberts, who was working as a shop assistant at the time.

It didn't long before Hasselhoff was smitten and the pair went on an extended date in the Swiss Alps.

In May, Hayley paid tribute to her former colleagues at the Debenhams store where she met her husband when she learned it was closing down.

'When I worked at Debenhams I realised that many of my coworkers had been there for many years and we all bonded with each other,' she wrote, according to ITV. 

'We were like family. It's sad to see this store close. I wish all the staff heartfelt luck and joy for the future.'

When she met Hasselhoff, Roberts was working at the make-up counter. 

The former Knight Rider star has two daughters from his marriage to second wife Pamela Bach: Taylor Ann Hasselhoff, 30, and Hayley Hasselhoff, 27.
