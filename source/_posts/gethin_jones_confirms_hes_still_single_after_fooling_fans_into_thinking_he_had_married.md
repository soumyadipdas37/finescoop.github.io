Gethin Jones has confirmed he is 'still single' after fooling fans and a host of his celebrity pals into thinking he had secretly tied the knot. 

The Welsh presenter, 42, took to Instagram on Tuesday afternoon sharing a picture of a gold wedding band alongside the caption: 'It's been a big day'. 

Heartthrob Gethin fooled a whole slew of stars such as Vernon Kay, Gabby Roslin and Charlotte Hawkins, who all flooded the comment section with congratulatory messages.

The former Blue Peter presenter tagged jewellers Clogau, where men's gold wedding bands cost between £490 to £1,320, with some fans twigging what Gethin's post was about. 

Gethin later took to Instagram to clarify the mix-up, delighting some fans who said their 2020 was 'ruined' by the news he had tied the knot.

He captioned the post: 'Great day on set with @clogaugold ... these guys treat me well, a wedding and a family (inc a dog) all in one day. Spoiler: I didn't *actually* get married in secret and yes, I’m still single!'

Surprise: The Welsh presenter broke the news in an Instagram post shared with his 80,000 followers but hasn't given too much away  (pictured in May, 2017)

He told fans in a video: 'Just finished filming for the day and put my phone on to lots of messages.

'Oops. Yeah it has been a big day because I got a wife, daughter and a dog. Today we celebrated Christmas. I can confirm that after time-traveling that Christmas is going to be brilliant. So yeah I’ve been filming a Christmas advert for Clogau.'    

While Gethin kept the identity of his new 'wife' a secret, he tagged jewellers Clogau, where men's gold wedding bands cost between £490 to £1,320.

Stunned celebrity friends were quick to congratulate Gethin following his announcement, with fellow presenter Gaby Roslin posting: 'Oh my word! Congratulations.' 

With tongue firmly in cheek, Vernon Kay added: Hang on big b**ls.......Stag Do....errrr hellllloooooo!!!!!'

While Eddie Boxhall, the fiancé of former Big Breakfast star Denise Van Outen, wrote: 'Congratulations to you both!!! Wishing you a lifetime full of love pal.'

This Morning's Dr Zoe Williams typed: 'Oooohhhhhh Congratulations', while Helen Skelton commented with two love heart emojis. 

However, some of Gethin's followers and friends suspected the presenter was just playing a prank and was really just doing some sort of photoshoot for the bespoke jewellers.  

One wrote: 'Ha! I think you are just messing with us!', while one of the former Blue Peter star's pal typed: 'Someone's shooting for Clogau. There's absolutely 0% chance there is anything romantic involved in this. Stand down everyone.'

Another chimed: 'Are you tricking us', while a different follower added: 'You been modelling again?!'

Gethin was previously engaged to Katherine Jenkins before the couple separated in December 2011 following a five-year relationship. 

Speaking in 2014, mezzo-soprano Katherine claimed it was Gethin who initiated their split, shortly before she embarked on a world tour.  

She: told Wales Online: 'At the end of 2011 when Gethin and I broke up, the reality of it was that about two weeks later I had to go on a UK tour where every night I’m singing songs of heartbreak and every day just trying to find the energy to cope let alone going on stage and understand his reason for doing it. 

'Meanwhile everybody else is under the impression it was my decision, my ambition, I wanted to take over the world. It was so far from the truth.'

While Katherine has since married painter and filmmaker Andrew Levitas, with whom she raises two children, Gethin's last known relationship was with German underwear model Katja Zwara. 

The couple separated in 2018 after a year of dating, with a source confirming to The Sun: 'Gethin and Katja remain pals but things just didn’t quite work out in the end. They split last month and have gone their separate ways.' 

Gethin also had a brief relationship with TV personality Lucy Mecklenburgh before the couple amicably parted ways in 2014.

Appearing on The One Show in July, co-host Alex Jones revealed he had enjoyed a 'virtual cooking date' with a mystery woman woman while isolating at home. 

Evidently flustered, Gethin replied: 'You said you wouldn't mention this!' 

The presenter, who was forced to self-quarantine after displaying COVID-19 symptoms while filming Celebrity MasterChef, later admitted it had been a successful date.   

He said: 'I did a cooking date virtually - and it lasted for hours.' 

MailOnline has contacted a representative for further comment.
