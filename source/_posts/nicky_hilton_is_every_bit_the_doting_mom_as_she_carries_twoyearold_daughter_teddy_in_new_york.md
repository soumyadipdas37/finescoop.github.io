She is an heiress, socialite, businesswoman, model, and fashion designer.

But Nicky Hilton's most fulfilling role seems to be one of a doting mom.

The 36-year-old member of both the Hilton and Rothschild families was seen on a stroll in New York with her youngest daughter Teddy Marilyn.

The heiress was full on mommy duty as she carried the two-year-old while out and about in the Big Apple. 

No doubt Teddy was in for a treat as they went to the Sour Patch Kids Store which recently opened and is the first of its kind.

The two made sure to keep safe as they kept their face masks on and maintained social distance from others on the outing.

Her signature blonde locks were worn down as she protected her eyes with a pair of black designer shades.

Nicky recently opened up to E! News about the first time she watched her sister's new documentary, which premiered last week on YouTube.

She recounted: 'It was very, very emotional. We watched it for the first time. She didn't even want to show my mother the movie. So we snuck downstairs and we were watching it together. 

'She said, "I don't want mom to see it." I was like, "Well she's going to see it in a few weeks when it's on YouTube for the whole world to see."'

Tearjerker: She recounted: 'We watched it together. We laughed. We cried. I'm just so proud of her, because going through so much trauma and reliving it with the whole world watching is very brave'

Nicky continued: 'We watched it together. We laughed. We cried. I'm just so proud of her, because going through so much trauma and reliving it with the whole world watching is very brave.'

Paris, 39, revealed a never-before-seen side of herself in the documentary, stripping away the shallow socialite character she's been pigeonholed into portraying. 

She told Variety of her portrayal in the film: 'I feel that I’ve grown up so much, especially in the past year. Doing this film, I just had so many realizations and realized who I truly am and why I am the way I am.'
