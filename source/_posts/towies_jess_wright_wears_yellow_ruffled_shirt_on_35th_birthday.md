The celebrations come after Jess revealed plans for her upcoming nuptials to fiancé William Lee-Kemp. 

She told Hello! how the pair have planned a ceremony in Majorca next June, overlooking the Mediterranean sea, and that there will be 15 bridesmaids - including her sister-in-law Michelle Keegan, actress wife of her brother Mark.

Mark himself will act as master of ceremonies.

'I've been dreaming of a fairytale wedding since I was little, when I used to dress up in my mum's net curtains,' she said. 

Will you marry me? William proposed to Jess in ski resort Courchevel, France, in February

'Now I can't wait for the moment I've been imagining for so long, walking up the aisle in a fabulous dress to marry Will.'

Of the location, she revealed: 'We've enjoyed some amazing holidays here and I practically grew up on the island because it's where my family has a second home.'

William proposed to Jess in ski resort Courchevel, France, in February. 

'At breakfast one morning he told me he was feeling unwell and returned to our room. When I went to find him, the door was ajar and there was music playing.

'There were candles lining the hallway, red rose petals scattered across the floor, flowers, red heart-shaped balloons and two glasses of champagne waiting. I was stunned. 

On cloud nine: On Friday evening the former TOWIE star enjoyed an early birthday dinner at the Ivy Asia in St Paul's

'Then Will called me out on to the balcony. With the snowy mountains behind him, he went down on one knee and asked me to marry him.' 

Jess has already delivered socially distanced formal invites to her 15 bridesmaids for their upcoming wedding. 

The TV star wrote on Instagram: '2020 has been a strange year for us all.

'I got engaged just before this pandemic, & when rules were eased, told my (many) nearest & dearest that I wanted them to be my bridesmaids, from a distance.

'I hope everyone is keeping safe & we get through this soon & a big thank you to all our NHS & key workers for supporting us.'
