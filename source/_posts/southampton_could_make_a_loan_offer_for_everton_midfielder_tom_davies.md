Southampton are interested in signing Everton midfielder Tom Davies.  

Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl has made no secret of his desire to sign a replacement for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, who left to join Tottenham Hotspur over the summer. 

Southampton are now set to sign the England under-21 international on a season-long loan deal, according to talkSPORT.

The 22-year-old has fallen down the pecking order at Goodison Park following the arrivals of Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure. 

Davies has played 123 times for his boyhood club, including twice this season.

He has netted six goals in that time, including one at St Mary's last season, but has seen midfielders Abdoulaye Doucoure and Allan arrive at Goodison Park this summer

Southampton would like to take the 22-year-old on loan with an option to buy, while Everton would prefer to sell.
