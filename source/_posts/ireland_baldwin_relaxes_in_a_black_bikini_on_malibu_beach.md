She recently celebrated being six years free from eating disorders which had a negative impact on her childhood.

And Ireland Baldwin appeared in great spirits as she relaxed on the beach in Malibu on Wednesday.

In her typical fashion, the model, 24, caught the eye in a black bikini by PrettyLittleThing, which flashed a hint of her chest through its cut-out detailing.

The celebrity offspring ensured focus remained on her incredible body tattoos by chilling on the sandy shores in the two-piece.

Proving less is more, the Grudge Match actress accessorised with just a pair of hooped earrings.

The influencer swept her shoulder-length tresses into a half up half down 'do, while opting for just light strokes of foundation.

Ireland recently became a big sister again after her father Alec and his second wife Hilaria Baldwin welcomed their fifth child.

The couple added another son, Eduardo, to their brood of Carmen, seven, Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two.

Meanwhile, earlier this month, the blonde posted a selfie to her Instagram which prompted a swift response from her mother.

Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger expressed alarm after her only child showed off a small black heart-shape tattoo inked high on her cheekbone close to her right eye.

'You better not had......that’s all I can say..........,' she wrote in the comments section.

Ireland later clarified the image had been temporary, sharing a clip to Instagram Story in which she smudged it and rubbed it away.

Back in 2018, Ireland had spoken publicly about her struggles with anorexia and bulimia, explaining: 'I battled with many eating disorders and body issues as a younger girl and it took me a long time to find self love and acceptance!'

She shared: 'I would eat a meal or more like a bite and have to run to the nearest bathroom or find digestive pills or run until I couldn’t feel my legs right before bed.

'I used to read people’s comments when I first started modeling and anytime anyone told me I was too tall or too fat to have done a job, I would run on a treadmill for the entire duration of at least three episodes of Friday Night Lights that I had on box set.'
