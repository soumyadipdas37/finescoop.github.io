Katie Price was left in hysterics on Monday after her eldest son Harvey, 18, did an impression of her boyfriend Carl Woods during a day of filming for the BBC.

The mother-of-five, 42, took to Instagram to share the video which she proudly captioned: 'Harvey makes me laugh at the end doing impression of @carljwoods,' followed by three crying laughing emojis.

In the footage, Harvey asks his mother to film his impression of Carl, 31, during a road trip.

The 18-year-old says: 'Are you ready?' to which Katie replies: 'I'm ready, what do you want to do?'

With Harvey then performing his impression of Carl as he jokes 'oh babes' and 'I love you babes' while kissing his own hand with Katie laughing in the background.    

Katie also shared a sweet selfie with her eldest son as she revealed they were filming something for the BBC.

She penned: 'Spending the day filming with @officialmrharveyprice for @bbc he is so funny.'

It comes after Katie revealed that her son Harvey wants her new boyfriend Carl to be his father.  

The glamour model has been dating former Love Island star Carl for three months yet things have moved very quickly between the pair. 

Harvey, who has multiple disabilities including blindness, Prader-Willi syndrome and ADHA, does not have a relationship with his biological father, Dwight Yorke. 

In an Instagram video shared earlier this month, Katie asked 'Harv, what do you want mummy and Carl to do?' to which the teenager responded: 'Be with mummy and Harvey and Carl... your daddy.'

Katie confirmed: 'You want Carl to be your what?' as her son responded, 'Harvey's daddy.'

As Katie asked Harvey 'Do you? Do you love Carl that much?' he replied, 'Yes mum.' 

Katie dated Harvey's biological father Dwight, 48, from 2000-2001, and has criticised the footballer for his alleged lack of contact with Harvey.

In her 2016 book Reborn, the mother-of-five insisted Dwight was unwilling to accept the limitations of his son's disabilities.

Condition: Harvey has the rare genetic disorder Prader-Willi Syndrome, among other health complications including being blind due to Septo-optic dysplasia, while he is also autistic

Harvey has the rare genetic disorder Prader-Willi Syndrome, among other health complications including being blind due to Septo-optic dysplasia, while he is also autistic, has an underactive thyroid and diabetes.  

Due to Harvey's complex needs, he lives in residential care, but has been home with Katie amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

In October 2019, Katie also claimed it has been 13 years since Dwight had seen Harvey, and in an emotional video two months later, she pleaded for the former footballer to see his son.

When asked if Dwight had been in touch for his son's birthday, she said: 'No, it's like he has no feelings for Harvey whatsoever.

Estranged: Katie shares Harvey with ex Dwight Yorke, they had split by the time she gave birth. The model has since criticised the sportsman for his treatment of their son (pictured in 2001) 

Family: Katie is also a mother to daughters Princess, 13, Bunny, six, and sons Jett, seven and Junior, 15  (Katie pictured with all five of her children) 

'The only thing that upsets me is that Harvey has a half-brother out there and he's never met him.'

She added that it was 'never too late' and that the door was 'always open' for Dwight to come back into his son's life. 

Katie is also mother to son Junior, 15, and daughter Princess, 13, with ex-husband Peter Andre and son Jett, seven, and daughter Bunny, six, with estranged husband Kieran Hayler. 

The glamour model has a chequered love life, but seems completely smitten with new boyfriend Carl, who has been caring for her after she broke both her feet on holiday. 

And last week, sources close to Katie said it 'wouldn't be a surprise' if they wed soon, after she took the car businessman's surname on a personalised number plate for her mobility scooter.
