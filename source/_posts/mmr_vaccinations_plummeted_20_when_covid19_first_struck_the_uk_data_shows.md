Vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) plummeted when Covid-19 first struck the UK, official data shows.

The number of children aged between 12 and 18 months getting the life-saving jabs plunged 20 per cent from March 15, from around 4,000 a week in 2019 to barely over 3,000.

Public Health England (PHE) figures show it stayed well below average until April 12, when it surged to the same levels as in 2019.

There was also a 'gradual decline' in the number of six-month-olds getting the hexavalent vaccine - which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, influenza type B and hepatitis B - at the start of lockdown.

PHE officials state the fall may be due to Covid-19 slogans about staying home, which could have crowded out the message that vaccines were still available, and the rescheduling of appointments by GPs at the start of the pandemic.

They said it was 'vital' parents ensured their children still attended all their vaccine appointments and caught up on any jabs that had been missed.

This graph shows the number of MMR - Measles Mumps and Rubella - vaccinations this year (red) and last year (blue). Week 1 is December 30 to January 5. The dip started in week 11, March 9 to 15, and continued until week 16, April 6 to 12

Uptake rates for vaccines have 'recovered' since the initial fall, figures published in the report shows, albeit at slightly lower numbers than last year.

The sudden dip was revealed using vaccination data from 203 clinical commissioning groups, which had received the information from their GPs. 

Gayatri Amirthalingam, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation at PHE, said it was 'encouraging' to see a rise in the number of children getting vaccinated in the summer following the 'large decline' at the start of lockdown.

'However, they are still lower compared to this time last year,' she cautioned.

'Given the ongoing risk of infectious disease like measles, where high coverage is essential to prevent outbreaks, it is vital that parents continue to ensure children attend routine vaccination appointments and catch up on any vaccinations they have missed.'

Vaccine uptake was increasing before the pandemic, with data from NHS Digital released last week showing the proportion receiving their first MMR jab by the age of two had risen from 90.3 per cent in 2018/19 to 90.6 per cent in 2019/20.

It marked the first time in six years that MMR coverage in England had increased following a peak of 92.7 per cent in 2013/14.

Vaccines need to be at levels of 95 per cent within the population to confer herd immunity, according to experts, amid fears the diseases could resurge if parents become too lax about vaccinations.

It comes as scientists around the world race to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus, which will then be made available to the public to allow them to return to pre-March 2020 normality.

The Oxford vaccine, which uses spike proteins from Covid-19 to generate an immune response, is tipped as one of the most hopeful candidates.

AstraZeneca, which owns the vaccine, is already producing millions of doses in anticipation of it being cleared by the UK regulator MHRA for use on humans.  

Dr Andrew Wakefield's 1998 Lancet study which claimed a link between the vaccine and autism caused vaccination rates to plummet, resulting in a rise in measles.

The findings were later discredited and the General Medical Council (GMC) struck him off, ruling he had been 'dishonest, irresponsible and showed callous disregard for the distress and pain' of children.

When Andrew Wakefield's paper claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was published by the Lancet in 1998 it caused a vaccine scare, with thousands of parents deciding to keep them away from their children.

But by 2004 holes had started to appear in his paper after other scientists found they could not replicate his findings.

This led to a two-and-a-half-year investigation by the General Medical Council which struck him off the list for 'abusing his position of trust' and showing 'callous disregard' for the welfare of children.

They found Wakefield had failed to declare a number of conflicting interests when he submitted the study, including the fact that he and several of the children in it were involved in a lawsuit to show that MMR was linked to autism.

They also said he had acted against his patients' best interests and mistreated developmentally delayed children, and had 'failed in his duties as a responsible consultant'.

Is it safe to take the MMR vaccine?

The NHS says there is 'absolutely no' evidence that the MMR vaccine is harmful to humans.

The World Health Organisation said in 2003, following an extensive review, that there is no evidence to support a link between MMR and autism.
