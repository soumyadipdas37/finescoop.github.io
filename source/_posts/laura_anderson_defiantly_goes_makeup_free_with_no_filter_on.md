Laura Anderson has defiantly hit back at trolls after sparking controversy with her 'changing face' after uploading a photo on Instagram on Tuesday. 

The Love Island star, 31, appeared make-up free and 'purposefully put no filter on' as she took to the social media site on Wednesday after causing backlash with her previous snap. 

Laura, who had been filming spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George, said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.

'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse.

'Like, "Laura doesn't look like Laura any more". It's really nice to read all those comments and I just think people need to get over the fact that a picture is just a picture. 

'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.'    

'I didn't even recognise her!' Love Island fans claimed Laura looked 'unrecognisable' as she reunited with her co-stars for socially-distanced filming  on Tuesday (R in 2018)

Defiant: Laura, who had been filming spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George, said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this'

 Laura hit back after social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance.

One wrote: 'OMG is that Laura !!!!!! I did not realise that was Laura!!!!! 

'That's not Laura!!! I didn't even recognise her!

'wow laura doesn't even look like laura... is that even Laura....' (sic)

'I got so much abuse': 'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse'







Stunned: Under the image shared to Jack's Instagram, social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance 

Another referenced the reality star's cosmetic procedures as they added: 'I don't even recognise Laura since her surgery. Shame she was so pretty and didn't need to change her appearance at all.' (sic)   

The media personality has made no secret of having Botox and lip fillers in the past - treatments she claimed she planned before entering the villa in 2018. 

TV star previously told The Sun: 'I went for a place that I know does a natural look. I know there's a lot of young people that follow me and I don't want to promote anything like that as it's a dangerous topic really.

Peace: Meanwhile, former pen salesman Jack, 26, also opted for a two-piece, as he rocked a vertically striped polo shirt and blue shorts

'People have to feel good [inside] before they do all that I believe that but for me it's something I wanted to do for a really long time and I came out and just did it as I was thinking about it while I was in there.

'It's a touchy subject and I get that and I would never want to promote that to young girls, but I still want to live my life for me. It's hard, but I'm nearly 30.'  

Meanwhile, a number of former Love Island stars have reportedly been left outraged, after allegedly being snubbed from appearing in an upcoming reunion special.





'She looks absolutely stunning!' Others decided to focus on how 'beautiful' the blonde looked on set

The three-part special, said to be called Love Island: Where Are They Now?, was originally planned to be restricted to the top four contestants from each series, but exceptions have reportedly been made − sparking alleged feuds.

A source told The Sun: 'Those involved are very excited, but it has put a few noses out of joint among stars who haven’t been asked, especially those who think they are bigger names than those who have.  

'Unfortunately things have got a bit nasty between some. At first it was just going to be the finalists from each series, but once exceptions started being made it really sparked anger and resentment.'

'I think I look fine': 'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love'

Among the former contestants expected to take part in the special are 2018 breakout stars and exes Megan Barton Hanson and Wes Nelson, and last year's runner-ups Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury.

Meanwhile, Montana Brown, who narrowly missed out on the finale in 2017 after she was dumped from the Mallorca villa with her then-beau Alex Beattie, is said to be included in the line-up of returning stars.

 MailOnline has contacted a representative for Love Island for comment.
