There's no love lost between The Bachelorette's Angie Kent and her former lover Timm Hanley.  

Appearing on Wednesday's Kyle And Jackie O Show, the 30-year-old revealed she no longer wants anything to do with Timm, 28, after seeing his bad-boy antics play out on Bachelor In Paradise. 

'I don't know him. Timm was completely different to the person I fell for on [The Bachelorette],' Angie lamented.

While she and Timm initially remained close friends after The Bachelorette wrapped filming, Angie said the line of communication has since closed.  

'I have no idea what Timm is like now,' Angie said.

Hearts broke for fan-favourite Timm after Angie brutally dumped him for Carlin Sterritt in the Bachelorette finale last year. 

However, when he returned to screens months later on Bachelor In Paradise, fans got to see a very different side to the long-haired larrikin. 

Timm was the centre of controversy after stirring up drama with several of his co-stars, including Cassandra Mamone, Renee Barrett and Matt Whyatt, before dramatically threatening to quit the show.

Angie admitted she was also shocked to see how differently Ciarran Stott behaved on Bachelor In Paradise following his sweet-natured performance on The Bachelorette.  

Ciarran established himself as the main 'villain' on Bachelor In Paradise thanks to his womanising behaviour 

Speculating on why Timm and Ciarran behaved so differently during his second appearance on screens, Angie said she believes it came down to 'the environment' and the male ego.

'[Timm and Ciarran had] just finished The Bachelorette, they've got their fifteen minutes, egos are huge, they're back with the boys,' Angie said, adding that being surrounded by a bevy of attractive women in Fiji also exacerbated the situation.  

'I was like, 'cool, this is what you're like when you're not locked down in The Bachelor,'' she declared. 

Angie also confessed that she doesn't like saying Timm or Ciarran's names in interviews anymore because she doesn't want to give them any more fame.
