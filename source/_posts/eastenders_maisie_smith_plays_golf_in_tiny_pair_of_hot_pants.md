Maisie opened up about her battle with body dysmorphia in the lyrics, admitting she remembers 'wishing she was thinner' from a young age.

She said that she has been feeling 'anxious' and 'trapped in her thoughts' while in isolation she penned the song in a bid to 'heal her mind'.

The song began: 'When I was little I would look in the mirror, holding in my stomach wishing that I was thinner.' 

Suggesting it is something she struggles with, Maisie added: 'Guess I had a case of body dysmorphia - and I still haven't shaken it off.' 

'Things were getting heavy, that's what the scales told me. 'Only 13 years old, wiping the tears of my cheeks, it felt like no-one else around me really understood.' 

Body dysmorphia, is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance, according the the NHS website.

Maisie also spoke out to her fans after trolls called her 'vain' for posting snaps of herself on Instagram.

Taking to her stories on the social media platform, the actress responded to the comments claiming she 'loved herself'.

Adopting a sarcastic tone, Maisie said of the reaction: 'I get a lot of comments saying that I'm vain and that I love myself, and you are absolutely right - I do love myself.

'It's taken me a while to feel this way. So, I'm sooo sorry if my happiness offends anyone because I'm just living my movie, I'm just living happily in my skin.

'I think that should be celebrated - not discouraged. Correct me if I'm wrong, guys.'
