Premier Mark McGowan has hit back at critics over his hard border restrictions, saying 'they don't have a clue' about life in Western Australia. 

Mr McGowan made the comments when asked about East Coast politicians who 'don't understand what life is like in WA' at a press conference on Friday.  

'I think some of the commentators might hang out on the North Shore of Sydney drinking their lattes and sipping their Pinot Grigio,' he said. 

'I don't think they have any clue about what goes on here, about our economy, about our jobs and about how we support them and I think those commentators in the east really need to learn a little bit about our state.'

Overall, Mr McGowan said commentary from eastern states 'shows a grievous and shocking misunderstanding of Western Australia'. 

Mr McGowan explained his critics 'want the hard border to be changed prematurely against our health advice'. 

'I just can't do that (remove the hard border). The hard border will stay in place for as long as the health advice recommends it,' he said. 

'By almost any measure, Western Australia is in an enviable position in the new COVID world. We've worked so hard to achieve this and we must do everything we can to maintain it. 

'A hotspot model of travel restrictions is not as effective as a hard border given the level of community transmission in other states.'

Mr McGowan also invited Prime Minister Scott Morrison to visit his state to see the 'Western Australian model' in action. 

'I'd urge the Prime Minister, if he wants to come here, to come and have a look. I think it's a great model and a great thing for the Prime Minister to have a look at and I'd be more than happy to show him around,' he said. 

The Premier said Mr Morrison would not be forced into hotel quarantine if he came to WA, provided he was visiting on Federal business. 

Mr McGowan closed down WA's borders on April 5 and it is now the only state left with a hard border. 

WA recorded no new cases of COVID-19 on Friday while NSW recorded eight and Victoria had 81 infections. 

The western state currently has just two active cases with a total of 655 cases over the course of the pandemic.  

By comparison, Victoria has 2,060 active cases and a total of 19,415 while NSW has 165 active cases and 3,910 cases overall.
