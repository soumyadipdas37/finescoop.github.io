Jonathan Cheban was seen dining with his mother Galina at Nobu in Malibu on Wednesday.

It was the first time the mother son duo has been seen since both were robbed at gun point in New Jersey this summer.

The two looked to be relaxed as they waited for the valet with Cheban dressed down and his mother dressed up in a smart suit.

Nobu Malibu is where the Kardashian and Jenner family often frequent as well as Scott Disick's ex Sofia Richie.

Cheban was in a peach hoodie with black pants and beige on-trend sneakers with a generous heel.

He was still not wearing a watch after his $250K timepiece was stolen. 

Galina was elegant in a black blazer with slacks, gold pumps and a mini Birkin bag from Hermes. She added a Louis Vuitton scarf.

In August Jonathan said he wants to sell his apartment in New York City, after his harrowing gunpoint robbery earlier this month. 

'I can't be there. It's very traumatic to be there,' the 46-year-old reality star, known as Foodgod, told Page Six on Monday. 'I want to sell my apartment in New York for sure because I can't imagine living there again.' 

While he was robbed in New Jersey, Cheban slammed Mayor Bill de Blasio for his lack of action over a recent spike in armed robberies, among Manhattan's Upper East Side.

'Daytime, nighttime, afternoon, Midtown, Uptown, Downtown, the mayor has destroyed the city,' he told the outlet. 'It's depressing. It's scary. I was on edge before, but now I'm even more on edge, obviously.

He added: 'I'm just confused as to how they're allowing this to happen,' he said. 'I just cannot believe [New Yorkers] would vote for this idiot two times.' 

Additionally, the star is grappling on how to cope after the 'horrifying' and 'definitely a life-changing experience.' 

The traumatic incident happened in the quiet, upscale suburban neighborhood of Englewood Cliffs on Sunday evening while the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was with a friend and mother, Galina. 

'It was frightening, I want the guys caught,' Cheban told DailyMail.com exclusively. 

'The mugger had a gun pointed at my mother's head,' Cheban added. 'There were two gunmen. It was frightening. It happened at 8:30 pm last night just as the sun was going down.'

This comes almost four years after Jonathan's good friend Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint inside her Paris hotel, The Hotel Pourtalès, during fashion week.

The gunmen barged their way into the room where Kim was with an assistant.

The men eventually tied Kim up and locked her in a bathroom as they stole her jewelry worth over $10M.

Kim has since said the robbery changed her life and she often does not go out with big items on. It also turned her focus in life toward her family and charity.
