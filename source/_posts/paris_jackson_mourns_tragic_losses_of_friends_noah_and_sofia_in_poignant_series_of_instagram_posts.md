'I’m late posting this, but i still had to process,' said Paris, the daughter of the late Michael Jackson. 'Noah you were such i swear that chipped-tooth smile brought pure sunshine into every single room it entered.. i’m sorry life was so hard on you, and the world so cruel.

She continued: 'You deserved nothing but light and joy and love, as that was what you brought into the lives of the people who knew you. it brings me peace to know you are now surrounded by those things, and no longer in pain. rest in transition, little brother. you will never be forgotten.'

The singer–songwriter, who's in a band called The Soundflowers, was back on the site hours later with what appeared to be another memorial for a lost friend, as she wrote, 'I hate this' and 'one [friend's passing] is already too much.'

She wrote, 'Sofia thank you so much for all of the cuddles, laughs, and friendship,' adding, 'There was never a dull moment with you.'

She added, 'You came into my life when i really needed it, and i wish i could have been there for you towards the end. you will be missed by so many. rest in transition love.'
