The future of jump racing at Southwell is in doubt after the BHA suspended it until further notice after two fatalities at Thursday's meeting.

The BHA were already conducting an investigation after the deaths of six horses at the Nottinghamshire venue owned by the Arena Racecourse Company (ARC) since National Hunt racing resumed there on July 1 after the COVID-19 shut down.

The BHA veterinary team and course inspectors will now be searching for any common factors to the fatal injuries.

Brant Dunshea, Chief Regulatory Officer at the BHA, said: 'The BHA and ARC met earlier this week and agreed a series of immediate measures which were put in place for this evening's meeting. 

'The course was inspected prior to racing by a BHA Course Inspector and was deemed fit to race. Pre-race checks were also carried out on all horses competing by BHA Veterinary Officers.

'In the sad event of two further fatalities, we have jointly decided with ARC to suspend Jump racing at Southwell until further notice whilst we work together to complete a detailed investigation.'

Fatal injuries on Thursday were suffered by Cillian's Well, who fell four out in the Support The ARC Racing Club Handicap Chase, and Day of Roses, who fell three out in the Kim Bailey Handicap Chase.

At the Southwell meeting on July 30, Elysian Prince was fatally injured in a fall with 2019 Cheltenham Festival winner Croco Bay and Lost On You being killed at the August 10 fixture. Three horses - Swarez, Avarchie and Booyakasha - died following on-course injuries at the meeting on August 24.

The next jumps meeting at Southwell was scheduled to be on September 15.
