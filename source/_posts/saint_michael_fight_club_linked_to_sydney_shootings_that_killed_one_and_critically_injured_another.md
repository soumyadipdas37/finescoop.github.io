The founder of an underground fight club is clinging to life in hospital and another man is dead after a double shooting in Sydney's inner west. 

Aleksandar Stefanovic, 36, was shot in the chest and found dead by a neighbour on Henry Street in Lewisham at 1pm on Friday. 

Hours later, Albert Rick Difloriano, 55, was discovered by tactical police with a shotgun wound to his head in a nearby property on Victoria Street.

The property is believed to be the clubhouse of the Saint Michael Christian Brothers Fight Club, which Mr Difloriano is also a founder of.       

Saint Michael Fight Club has been linked to bikies in recent years as well as another fatal shooting in Leichhardt in 2014.  

Saint Michael Fight Club founder Albert Rick Difloriano, 55, was covered up as he was transferred onto an ambulance in Lewisham on Friday. It's believed he shot himself in the head with a shotgun after his business associate Aleksandar Stefanovic, 36, was shot dead 

Police were told Mr Difloriano and Mr Stefanovic had an argument before Mr Stefanovic was shot on Henry Street, according to The Daily Telegraph.   

Mr Difloriano reportedly then went to the Victoria Street property, where he shot himself in the head with a shotgun, according to the police source. 

A woman who witnessed the shooting was led from the scene with forensic bags over her hands and taken to Newtown Police Station. 

The property which is next to a corner store, has blacked-out windows and is the registered address of the Saint Michael Fight Club, which Mr Stefanovic is reportedly also linked to.

Mr Difloriano and Mr Stefanovic lived next to each other for several years and ran the fight club together, according to 7News.

What caused the argument between Mr Difloriano and Mr Stefanovic and subsequent shootings remains unclear. 

A neighbour said motorbikes were often parked outside of the fight clubhouse.  

'When my dog was a puppy I would pass and they had ferocious dogs that would froth at the mouth,' she told The Daily Telegraph. 

'There were always motorbikes parked out the front and we got a bad vibe.'

Members of the fight club are mainly of Catholic-Italian descent, hence the reference to Saint Michael, and share a common interest in Muay Thai boxing. 

Saint Michael Fight Club made headlines in 2014 when one of its members Diego Carbone shot dead father-of-two Brad Dillon, 25, on a busy street in Leichhardt. 

Carbone's cousin Antonio Bagnato, who was also a fight club member, flew to Thailand shortly after the shooting. 

Bagnato was sentenced to death for the murder of Hells Angel bikie Wayne Schneider in Thailand in 2015 but had his sentence reduced. He remains in jail.
