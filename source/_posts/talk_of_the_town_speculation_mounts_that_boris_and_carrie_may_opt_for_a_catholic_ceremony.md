Speculation is mounting that Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds may opt for a Catholic ceremony when they eventually tie the knot. 

The Catholic Herald and religious magazine The Tablet report that the couple will honour Carrie's faith. 

The door is open for a religious service as neither Boris's first marriage to his university girlfriend Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987, nor his second, to barrister Marina Wheeler in 1993, took place in a Catholic church.

And the couple's five-month-old son Wilfred has just been baptised into the faith.

PR guru Matthew Freud may be selling his £30 million party pad in trendy Primrose Hill but I wonder if the new owner will be making a bid for some of the curious fixtures and fittings.
