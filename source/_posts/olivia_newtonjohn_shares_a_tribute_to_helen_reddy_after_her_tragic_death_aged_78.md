Olivia Newton-John has shared a heartbreaking tribute to Helen Reddy following the Australian singer's death on Tuesday at the age of 78.

The actress, 72, posted a never-before-seen photograph of herself and Helen playing tennis during their earlier years to Instagram on Thursday.

'Helen Reddy encouraged me and paved the way for my success in the USA,' Olivia wrote.

'Thank you Helen for your friendship, your voice and your passion for women's rights - you will be missed,' she said.

Reddy died in Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon, five years after she was diagnosed with dementia.

In addition to her feminist anthem I Am Woman, the Melbourne-born songstress was also known for her hits Delta Dawn and Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady.

Helen's two children, Traci Donat and Jordan Sommers, announced their mother's death on Facebook.

They wrote in a joint statement: 'It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved mother, Helen Reddy, on the afternoon of September 29, 2020, in Los Angeles.

'She was a wonderful mother, grandmother and a truly formidable woman. Our hearts are broken. But we take comfort in the knowledge that her voice will live on forever.'

Her cause of death has not yet been confirmed.

Since her dementia diagnosis in 2015, Helen had been living in a nursing home in LA for retired Hollywood talent.

Media commentator Peter Ford said on 6PR: 'She has been in not great health for several years now. You may be aware that dementia struck her about three years ago and she's been getting progressively worse.'

Reddy was a pioneer behind the women's rights movement of the 1970s, and her death comes just months after the biopic I Am Woman depicted the many social changes her music inspired throughout her career.

Back in 2005, Helen said she wasn't afraid of dying in an interview with Australian broadcaster Margaret Throsby.

'I see dying as going home... where we came from,' she said. 'Where we all go back to. I've seen enough of the other side to know that that is our true home. That is where we are loved beyond anything we can imagine here.'
