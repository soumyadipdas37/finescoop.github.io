Tennis star Andy Murray is urging officials to consider renaming Melbourne's Margaret Court Arena over the Australian's anti-gay stance.

Court once praised South Africa's apartheid system, said 'tennis is full of lesbians' and described transgender children as 'the work of the devil'.  

British three-time Grand Slam champion Murray says he doesn't think the tennis veteran's values align with the sport.

'She has obviously offended and upset a lot of people over the years,' said Murray in an interview with Pridelife.com.

'I think the players certainly have spoken up, which is a positive thing.

'As far as renaming the venue. I think that yes, it's something the sport should consider.'

Murray, who is a five-time runner-up at the Australian Open, said her opinions are drawing attention away from the game.

'When you get to the Australian Open you want to concentrate on the tennis. Court's views detract from that,' said Murray.'

'I don't know who makes the final decision on that but I don't think her values are what tennis stands for.'

Murray's comments follow calls from WTA founder Billie Jean King to remove Court's name from one of the main stadiums at the Australian Open's Melbourne Park venue.

A number of other senior figures in the tennis world have also criticised Court over her conservative views.

Court, who won a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles, has become a divisive figure in tennis, and especially at the Australian Open.

At the tournament in January, Tennis Australia held a low-key ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of her 1970 calendar-year Grand Slam.

Officials noted her views had 'demeaned and hurt many in our community'.

Murray said her reception from the public was 'lukewarm.'

At the same tournament, American greats John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova were reprimanded for an on court protest.

They unfurled a banner calling for Margaret Court Arena to be renamed after Evonne Goolagong, the three-time Australian Open winner. 

In retirement, Court, now a devoutly Christian church pastor and based in Perth, Western Australia, has often attracted controversy over her comments on race and homosexuality.
