Wow! Barbara Palvin looked incredible on Monday as she stripped to her underwear for a sizzling snap

Barbara finished her look with a pair of jeans which she wore unfastened on her hips to show off the lingerie set.

She styled her brunette locks into a sweptback ponytail and added a slick of make-up to enhance her stunning features.

Barbara knew how to work her best angles as she posed up a storm in front of a light-up mirror in the bathroom. 

Adding a cheeky caption, she wrote: 'Getting ready for date night in my Very Sexy push-up bra. The girls are going out tonight @victoriassecret.'

The model soared to fame when she appeared on a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2016, she has since become a Victoria's Secret Angel.   

Barbara was recently spotted celebrating boyfriend Dylan Sprouse's 28th birthday earlier this month in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. 

Dylan wasn't the only one celebrating a birthday that night either, with his twin brother Cole Sprouse also turning 28.

Cole wasn't seen out with the pals, but Dylan gave him a shout-out on Instagram, where he posted a photo of their silly birthday cake.

The frosted green cake featured a silly image of the brothers, and sat conveniently beside a bottle of hand sanitiser.

'Happy birthday to the Tommy to my Timmy...or the Timmy to my Tommy. All that is important is we say the same thing with a slight delay and whether we short the stalk market. To almost 30,' he captioned the snap.

Cole also wished his brother happy birthday with a 'cursed photo from our youth', featuring the young boys leading a rock band.   

'Happy birthday to @dylansprouse , you've never quite had the same overwhelming confidence and drip as me, but you're learning, and that's okay,' Cole captioned the snap. 

'This is a cursed photo from our youth, and a brief reminder that you and I have been hustling and exploiting every possible avenue of the this industry since we were 8 months old. Lots of trial and error in success, love you very much.'
