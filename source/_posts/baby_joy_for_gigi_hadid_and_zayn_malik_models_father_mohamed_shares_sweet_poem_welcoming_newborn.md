The model's father Mohamed Hadid revealed the happy news after posting a tender poem for his granddaughter on Instagram Wednesday.

'Welcome my little grandchild. I wish for you the sun and the moon,' he shared in the note, which was titled: 'Grandpa's heart.'

'Know that Grandpa's always near, I'll do anything, anything for you my dear.'

'When I heard you were on the way, I smiled and wiped a tear away. I cried the tear because I know, my heart would always belong to you,' he finished before signing off.

Yesterday fans began wondering if Gigi and Zayn had welcomed their child after younger sister Bella Hadid, 23, posted a throwback photo with her pregnant sibling.

In the caption Bella shared a baby angel emoji and said:  'I love you both so freaking much -can’tstopcrying.'

Gigi seemed to hint that her child was on the way at the end of August when she shared a stunning photo of herself at 33-weeks.

At the time it was unclear whether she was counting down from the time of the post or the photoshoot.

Gigi confirmed her pregnancy in April, after 'family sources' first revealed the news.
