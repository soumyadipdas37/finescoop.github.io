Sam said: 'Because we want to have a party with more than 20 people, we have sort of put it on hold.' 

She stresses that they will 'get there' but aren't in any hurry.  

The TV host added: 'We will get married but put the planning on hold because there is no point until we can actually make a proper plan in booking anything so no plans yet but we will get there.'

Earlier this month her Sunrise co-star Edwina Bartholomew accidentally let slip a detail about the TV presenter's upcoming nuptials in a birthday tribute for her pal.

 'Happy birthday @sam_armytage Next time we are drunk in a paddock will be on your big day,' she captioned the post.

While Edwina didn't specify exactly where Sam plans on tying the knot, it is likely that she was referring to one of the rural properties owned by Sam and Richard in the Southern Highlands of NSW. 

Samantha recently sold her multi-million dollar Bondi pad and it's assumed that she will be residing with fiancé Richard at his Berrima estate.
