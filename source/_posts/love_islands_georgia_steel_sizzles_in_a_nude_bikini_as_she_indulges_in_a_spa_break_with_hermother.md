She shot to fame with her no-nonsense attitude on the 2018 series of Love Island. 

And Georgia Steel looked as though she'd come straight from the villa as she set pulses racing in a nude bikini while perched on a sun lounger in a snap posted to her Instagram on Tuesday.

The reality star, 22, posed up a storm as she documented her lavish break at The Spa at Carden in Cheshire with her mother, Sharon.

She sported the nude two-piece which featured gold ring detailing and a pink band that wrapped around her taut midriff. 

Georgia decided to let her natural beauty shine through with a makeup-free look.

She captioned the image: 'My mum liked this one,' to which fellow Love Islander Elma Pazar responded: 'So do I,' accompanied by a heart emoji. 

Hayley Hughes also commented: 'My pretty girl,' while Eve Gale wrote: 'Omg insane,' accompanied by heart emojis. 

High praise: The reality TV star, 22, caught the attention of her Love Island pals as she posed up a storm on her relaxing break 

Francesca Allen from the 2019 series of Love Island called Georgia: 'Super cute'.

The mother-daughter duo achieved ultimate relaxation at the spa with a massage, jacuzzi time, and a delectable evening meal accompanied by a glass of wine.  

For their dinner date, Georgia sported a chic strapless top and kept her tresses tucked away in a sleek bun. 

Georgia switched into another swimsuit on Wednesday as she sported a beige crotchet swimsuit with tie shoulder straps and a scallop hem from the online fashion brand, Maiyo. 

A chic white belt with a gold buckle tied at her waist to accentuate her hourglass frame.

Georgia has been single ever since breaking up from her fiancé, Ibiza Weekender star Callum Izzard, 25, in April.

Speaking on FUBAR Radio, she revealed she's in no rush to jump into a new relationship.

She explained: 'I'm a good believer in everything happens for a reason and I'm just rolling with it.' 

The former couple's whirlwind romance began in August 2019 when they met during the filming of Ex on the Beach: Peak Of Love, with the pair becoming engaged just a month later.

When asked if she's had many guys sliding into her DMs, Georgia said: 'I just want some time now to just focus on myself and I'm not really wanting to rush into anything. I'm just wanting to take every day as it comes!'

Wow: Georgia shared a striking snap as she emerged from the water wearing the crotchet one-piece and her water-drenched tresses were swept back
