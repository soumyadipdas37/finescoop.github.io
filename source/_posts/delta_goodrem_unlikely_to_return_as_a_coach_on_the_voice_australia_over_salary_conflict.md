Delta Goodrem is likely to not return to The Voice's new line-up of coaches after the reality show moved networks.

Channel Seven announced they have secured the rights to the singing competition over rivals at the Nine Network last month.

And it seems that Seven is unlikely to offer the Born To Try hitmaker a spinning chair due to a 'salary conflict,' The Daily Telegraph reported on Saturday.

Delta, who is rumoured to earn between $1million to $2million a year, is out of the network's price range, according to the publication.

But it seems Seven are in talks with other established local artists to join the show, as to re-sign her fellow judge Guy Sebastian.  

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Seven for comment.

Despite being the longest-serving coach on The Voice Australia, some viewers have called for Delta to be axed from the show.

Fans flocked to Facebook begging for Seven not to cast her, including one who wrote: 'Please no more Delta!'

'If they get rid of Delta I might actually watch this. Can't stand her,' one viewer wrote.

Earlier this month, The Daily Telegraph also reported that Channel Seven is 'set to axe coaches Boy George and Kelly Rowland' as part of a cost-cutting measure.

The publication understands the network feels Nine 'spent too much on B-listers' and is keen to spend their money on big-name replacements.

'One of the big changes Seven plans to make is how much is being spent on judges,' a source close to The Voice reportedly said.

It is claimed Seven is 'in talks' with American R&B star Usher, while other replacements include Kylie Minogue and homegrown talent, Jessica Mauboy. 

Big Brother host Sonia Kruger, 55, who previously presented the singing competition and is now over at Seven, is set to host the series in 2021.
