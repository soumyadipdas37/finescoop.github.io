A student freshers' guide has been slammed for joking about 'tribes of predatory straight men' and defending male 'locker room banter' at the University of St Andrews.

Linden Grigg, a third-year student and deputy editor of The Saint - St Andrew's student paper, wrote the article which has since been removed from the paper's website. 

The article, which joked about 'tribes of predatory straight men... directed solely by their groins', was published after more than 100 first-hand accounts of alleged rapes and sexual assaults at the university were posted online since the beginning of July. 

An Instagram account, St Andrews Survivors, gives a voice to those who claim to have been sexually abused and is working with the university to try and come up with ways to offer victims more support and reduce the numbers of sexual assaults.

About 250 people have claimed to have been sexually assaulted or raped at the university.

The allegations have so far led to a US fraternity (Alpha Epsilon Pi) and the Kate Kennedy Club suspending some of their members and launching investigations. 

Mr Grigg joked about 'tribes of predatory straight men...directed solely by their groins' and argued it was a myth that male 'locker room culture' encouraged rape and sexual violence towards women, according to The Times.

He described himself as a 'trashy man', adding: 'I have very indistinct notions of consequences.' 

Mr Grigg then claimed that friendships between people of the opposite sex never work because the 'human urge to phsyicalise emotion will scupper it'. 

A statement from its executive team said: 'We apologise for the humorous tone with which salient issues were approached. We take seriously the concerns of the student body and recognise our failure' 

The university's Feministy Society strongly criticised The Saint for running what they deemed to be an 'incredibly damaging' article which lent 'no empathy to those who have experienced any form of sexual violence. 

The backlash received prompted The Saint to pull the article, amend it and run an apology.   

A statement from its executive team said: 'We apologise for the humorous tone with which salient issues were approached. We take seriously the concerns of the student body and recognise our failure.

'The Saint takes gender-based sexual violence seriously and we acknowledge your criticism and hope better articles will be produced as a consequence.'

Mr Grigg said: 'I apologise to all members of the St Andrews community who feel that I have disregarded their very real experiences of sexual assault. My intention was certainly never to write an article in which these experiences were mocked or derided.'

He also added that he has three sisters and a mother who is is role model. He added: 'It goes without saying that I respect all women.'

The Feminist Society however has stated that it remains 'unconvinced of the authors realisation of his actions and would like to point out that almost everyone is related to a woman, which therefore does not automatically mean that you respect women'.  

Milo Farragher-Hanks, a fellow student journalist, criticised his colleague's judgment, writing on social media: 'I am the culture editor at The Saint and am also deeply unhappy about the decision to publish this article. I have messaged the editor -in-chief.'
