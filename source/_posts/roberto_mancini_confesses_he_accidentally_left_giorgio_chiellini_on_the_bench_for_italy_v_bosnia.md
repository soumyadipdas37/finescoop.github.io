Italy manager Roberto Mancini has revealed that he mistakenly didn't start Giorgio Chiellini against Bosnia & Herzegovina as he didn't have his glasses on.

The Italian media widely expected experienced Juventus defender Chiellini to start in the Nations League game in Florence.

However, to much surprise, Lazio's Francesco Acerbi started instead as he won his seventh international cap.

Mancini revealed that, rather remarkably, he didn't realise that Acerbi had been listed instead of Chiellini when he was shown the teamsheet prior to the game.

The 55-year-old admitted that Chiellini will now start Monday's game away to the Netherlands instead. 

As reported by Football Italia, Mancini said: 'It was my fault.

'They showed me the line-up, I didn't have my glasses on and just said it was fine. I didn't notice Acerbi was there rather than Chiellini.

'Anyway, we had planned originally for Acerbi to play one game and Chiellini another. I had asked Giorgio if he wanted to play today or on Monday with Holland, he said today, but we'll have to swap it now.

'It's not like we chose a goalkeeper rather than a defender, it's not a massive difference, but yes, it was an error.'

Bosnia took the lead in the 57th minute courtesy of Edin Dzeko.

However, Italy managed to get a point from proceedings, with Stefano Sensi scoring in the 67th minute. 

The result saw Italy's run of eleven successive victories come to an end.
