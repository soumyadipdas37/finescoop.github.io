An amazing photo of a young footy player jumping in the air after helping guide his team to Grand Final glory took social media by storm. 

Shane Inkamala, 17, from Papunya in the Northern Territory, was pictured leaping into the sky on Sunday while celebrating an epic goal against Yuendumu in the MacDonnell Regional Council Under 18 Boys Grand Final in Alice Springs.

Inkamala was pictured with his arms tensed and with a look of determination on his face, as a teammate rushed in to celebrate with him. 

The timing of the photo was perfect, making it look as if the star player was floating.

The incredible image was shared more than 300 times and garnered over 200 comments after being posted to social media on Tuesday. 

'Looks like he's got a jet pack on! Amazing,' one social media user wrote. 

'Surely there's a trampoline built into the grass,' another joked. 

'That man is flying,' another added. 

Inkamala's team secured the Grand Final win over Yuendumu, 83 points to 28. 

He was one of the standout prospects from the weekend of football after also playing in the NAB AFL Under 18 All-Star game in Darwin on September 25. 

Another amazing picture of the 17-year-old emerged from that game, showing him riding the shoulders of an opposing player while taking a spectacular mark.  

After the impressive weekend some football fans predicted Inkamala would be the AFL's next star player.
