Andy Murray has revealed he intends to respond to his early French Open exit by playing as much as possible for the rest of the year.

The former world No 1 and 2016 finalist suffered a sobering three-set defeat to Stan Wawrinka in the first round at Roland Garros, with the 33-year-old Scot winning just six games as he crashed 6-1 6-3 6-2 on Sunday.

The loss to his old Swiss rival was Murray's equal heaviest in a Grand Slam tournament and came on the back of only taking nine games against Felix Auger-Aliassime in the second round of the US Open.

Murray, who is battling back after having right hip surgery in January 2018 and 2019, was competing in his first clay-court match since reaching the 2017 semi-finals in Paris, where he again lost to Wawrinka.

But he revealed he now aims to play as many matches as possible for the rest of 2020, including events in Germany before heading to Australia.

'I know tournament-wise I'm going to try to play as much as I can between now and the end of the year,' Murray said. 

'The plan is to play in Cologne, the two tournaments there. Probably the only positive (of his defeat by Wawrinka) is I will get more time to prepare on the indoor hard courts for that.'

Murray accepts travelling to Australia will depend on Covid-19 restrictions, but he hopes to be part of Britain's team for the new 24-nation ATP Cup in early January ahead of the Australian Open in Melbourne later that month.

'We don't know exactly what the rules are going to be for Australia, but it's looking like you'll have to get there very early to prepare for that,' Murray added.

'As it stands, I wouldn't make the ATP Cup team, but my understanding is they are looking to put an ATP event on in Australia the beginning of the year, so that's currently what I would be doing.        

'I'd like to play in the ATP Cup because I was supposed to last year, and it looked like a great event.

'My plan is to for sure go to Australia. I just don't know exactly what the exact situation is in terms of what date we would have to go, because by the sounds of it, it's pretty early I think. You'd have to go like mid-December.'

Murray is now 3-3 since the resumption of the ATP Tour after the five-month COVID-19 suspension, and is currently ranked world No 111.

'I'll need to have a long, hard think and try and understand what happened,' he said after losing to Wawrinka.

'It's not for me the sort of match I would just brush aside and not give any thought to. There are obviously reasons behind a performance kind of like that.'
