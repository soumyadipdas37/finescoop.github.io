A picture of happiness: Romeo and Mia - who have been dating Romeo since May last year - have been happily flaunting their romance on social media all summer

David cut a casual figure in a white slogan print tee paired with black trousers as he held onto a glass of wine and embraced Romeo.

Romeo, who looked trendy in a white tee and tan jeans laughed as Brooklyn appeared to lip-sync beside him. 

The good times continued to roll in the next photo captured by VB which showed David and eldest son Brooklyn cracking up with laughter as they relaxed on a sofa.

Fashion designer Victoria captioned the photo: 'My boys.'

Youngest son Cruz joined the line-up for a sweet photo posted by David, which showed the star and his boys posing at sunset in the country (the same shot shared later by Romeo). 

David wrote: 'Nothing like a fathers bond with his sons love you boys @brooklynbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham.'   

It comes after David, who is reportedly being lined up for a stint on Celebrity Bake Off, is said to have been experimenting with recipes during the lockdown.

Although it has been claimed that the fashion designer who is known for her love of steamed fish and vegetables, is 'back to clean eating' now autumn is approaching. 

A source told The Sun: 'Victoria hasn't touched a carb since 2001. But at the start of lockdown, David started experimenting with recipes — making the dough from scratch and trying various toppings.'

They added: 'Victoria eventually relented and had a small slice.    

On-the-go: David revealed he was still on his fitness A game as he worked up a sweat on a topless run with his son Romeo on Sunday

'Things progressed and, basically, she couldn't get enough of David's delicious golden dough balls.' 

MailOnline has contacted the Beckham's representative for comment.  

David has been perfecting his recipes on their lavish Cotswold estate where he has been spending the lockdown with his wife and three children, Romeo, Cruz amd daughter Harper, nine.

Brooklyn, spent it in America with fiancée Nicola Peltz.
