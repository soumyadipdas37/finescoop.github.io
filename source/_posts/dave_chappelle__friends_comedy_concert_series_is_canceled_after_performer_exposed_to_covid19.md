The comedy concert series Dave Chappelle & Friends - An Intimate Socially Distanced Affair has been canceled after an unnamed performer had 'possible exposure to COVID-19' a rep for the series said on Tuesday.

The show, which had stemmed from Yellow Springs, Ohio this past summer, had been slated to run four more shows through October 4.

Organizers shut things down on Friday after a regular performer was thought to be positive for coronavirus.

'For the past three months of the pandemic, Dave Chappelle has successfully created a safe haven for comedians, musicians and poets to express their art without incident,' a rep told the outlet. 

The rep continued: 'Social distancing, face masks, hand sanitizer, temperature checks and access to daily COVID tests have all been a part of our protocol. We take COVID-19 very seriously and there have been no reported cases among patrons or crew.'

Chappelle’s wife Elaine, according to Dayton.com, had said in a closed Facebook group: 'We take COVID-19 very seriously and there have been no reported cases among patrons or crew. 

'However, due to a possible exposure within our inner circle, and out of an abundance of caution, we have elected to cancel the remaining ... shows.'

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine had cleared the legendary comedian to put on the shows with strict protocols amid the pandemic, according to Dayton.com. Zoning Inspector Richard Zopf got nearly 2,500 letters and emails in support of the shows. 

Comedians who had appeared on the series of shows included Sarah Silverman, Chris Rock, David Letterman, Jon Stewart, Tiffany Haddish, Michael Che, Michelle Wolf and Louis CK.
