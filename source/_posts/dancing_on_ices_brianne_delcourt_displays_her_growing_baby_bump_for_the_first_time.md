Dancing On Ice's Brianne Delcourt has revealed her growing baby bump for the first time since announcing her pregnancy.

The TV star, 39, is expecting her first child with former footballer Kevin Kilbane, 43, with the couple making the announcement earlier this month. 

The couple tied the knot in September after they enjoyed a whirlwind romance since meeting on Dancing On Ice last year.

Along with Brianne's pregnancy, the couple also revealed that they tied the knot earlier this month in Canada.

Speaking to OK! magazine, Brianne said she is five months pregnant and that the news came as a shock, but made their wedding all the more special. 

Kevin told the magazine: 'Everything may seem fast in other people’s eyes and we can’t believe it ourselves but we do everything together so this was naturally the next step.'

As well as revealing their baby news, the couple confirmed that they married earlier this month after the pandemic forced them to cancel their dream wedding in Ireland.

Discussing their ceremony, which took place at Bonnie View Inn in Haliburton, Ontario, Brianne noted: 'When I look back now I realise it worked out perfectly. It was intimate and just about Kevin and I.'

Cancelled: Brianne had been due to marry Kevin in a big wedding in Ireland, but the coronavirus pandemic had meant they had to cancel their plans

Due to Covid travelling restrictions, the couple were unable to have any guests with them from the UK, so their nuptials were attended only by Brianne's daughter Gracie, her immediate family, and two friends. 

Yet the pair still had an incredible day, with Brianne gushing: 'It was amazing. Of course we had Gracie with us, but to also have our baby in my stomach took it to a complete other level. The baby kicked as we said "I do".' 

The pair are now planning to have a lavish wedding ceremony in Ireland next year that can be attended by all their friends and family. 

Previously speaking about her wedding plans, the blonde beauty told Hello! magazine: 'I have found The Dress, and our heart is set on getting married in Ireland, it will be so beautiful, and it is special to Kevin.'

Kevin’s late father was born in County Mayo in Ireland. 

The couple added that they intended to have two maids of honour and two best men, with Brianne adding she hopes her daughter Gracie 'will be my flower-girl but she might just take over the whole day'.

Following their pregnancy news, however, the couple will have another child to fit into the wedding party when they tie the knot next year.  

This is the couple's first child together. Although they have yet to learn the sex of their baby, Brianne confirmed their baby is due in February. 

The professional skater raises three-year-old daughter Gracie with an unnamed ex.

Meanwhile, Kevin has two daughters, 16-year-old Elsie and 14-year-old Isla, with his ex-wife Laura, who he split from in 2011 after 12 years of marriage. 

Brianne and Kevin teased the news they wed earlier this month when they took to Instagram to post a photo of themselves clinking champagne glasses. 

Brianne wrote: 'So, today was the day Kevin & I were supposed to be getting married in Ireland 09-04-2020. Damn you Covid..., so we celebrated our way .......'. 

The professional skater looked gorgeous in a lace floral bridal dress which featured a plunging neckline.  

Posing in front of a scenic sea backdrop,  Brianne's veil fluttered in the wind as footballer Kevin, who looked dapper in a tuxedo and bow tie, kissed her on the lips. 

The retired Everton ace also shared the photograph on Instagram and wrote: 'We celebrated our proposed wedding day anyway.. I love you'.

Brianne and Kevin first met in October when they were partnered on Dancing On Ice, and they have been in a relationship since December.

The couple then got engaged just two months later after being eliminated from the show, with Kevin popping the question at a steakhouse in London. 

In their first TV interview as a couple, Kevin recalled how it was almost love at first sight when he was paired up with Brianne.

He said on Lorraine: 'When we first met four months ago, everything happened very quickly, it absolutely did. I certainly knew straight away that was it, yeah.

'I had huge reservations when I signed up for the show but then Brianne and I got together and it was great, I could have quit before the show started and I would have been happy. Everything's been great, everything's gone really well.'

Brianne, who quit Dancing On Ice last month, has hit the headlines with her past relationships, having previously romanced her DOI celebrity partners Matt Lapinskas and Sam Attwater as well as Danny Young, who was partnered with Frankie Poultney.

She previously insisted that Kevin isn't part of a pattern, as she gushed to OK magazine: 'There is no comparison of Kevin to the guys I used to date.

'He's perfect and my best friend. Kevin has all the boxes checked for what I'm looking for in my life.'

Meanwhile, Kevin's relationship with his wife Laura came to an end in 2011 after 12 years of marriage.

The pair tied the knot when Kevin was just 22 and he blamed the split on the couple being 'naive' about settling down at such a young age. 

Canadian pair skater Brianna Delcourt has hit the headlines with her past relationships, having romanced four celebrity contestants on Dancing On Ice 

2010 -  Danny Young

Brianne made her show debut during series five with Hollyoaks star Kieron Richardson, with the pair finishing in third place. 

Despite not winning, the blonde bombshell bagged herself a man, striking up a romance with Coronation Street actor Danny Young, who was partnered with skater Frankie Poultney.

The couple started dating shortly after the series finished and moved in together later that year. 

The pair split within a few months and despite rekindling their romance in 2011, it wasn't meant to be, as Brianne then met her next boyfriend, Sam Attwater.

2011 - Sam Attwater

During her second season on the show, Brianne was partnered with EastEnders star Sam Attwater, with the couple going on to win the series. 

They didn't just take home the trophy, however, with Brianne and Sam striking up a romance during their time on the ice. 

However, many fans questioned the legitimacy of their relationship after Sam was pictured kissing Alexandra Schauman, 30, another professional skater.

2013 - Matt Lapinskas

Brianne was partnered with EastEnders actor Matt Lapinskas in 2013, who at the time was dating his co-star Shona McGarty. 

Matt and Shona had been dating for 18 months and split during his time on Dancing On Ice, he then began dating Brianne. 

The actor denied that he had been unfaithful to Shona and insisted he didn't strike up a romance with Brianne until he was single. 

However, after they split the following year, Brianne went on to tell The Sun On Sunday: 'He pursed me behind Shona's back. Lots of people warned me but I didn't listen.'

Brianne also claimed that Matt had cheated on her with his new co-star, Camilla Rowland. 

She revealed: 'Matt has totally betrayed me. He's been nasty and he's life, when all I've done for the last two years is try to help and protect him'.
