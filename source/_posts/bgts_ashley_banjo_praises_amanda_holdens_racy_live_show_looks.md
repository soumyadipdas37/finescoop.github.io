Britain's Got Talent judge Ashley Banjo has thrown his support behind Amanda Holden's risqué live show looks.

The Diversity star insisted the presenter, 49, 'isn't changing for anyone' despite her sexy ensembles sparking backlash and even complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.

Ashley also hinted he'd 'love' to reprise his role as a judge on the BGT judging panel next series after stepping in for Simon Cowell for this year's semi-finals after he broke his back in a bike accident.

Asked whether Amanda will be ditching her usual risqué outfits for this year's semi-finals, Ashley told The Sun she has no plans to tone down her look.

He said: 'I don't see Amanda changing for anyone, let me tell you that. She looks good though, so you know what, go for it.'

In recent years Amanda's BGT live show looks have sparked outrage from viewers who claimed they were too revealing for pre-watershed television, with one 2017 gown sparking 216 complaints to the media watchdog.

But Amanda has always laughed off the outrage, telling The Sun last year: 'My t*ts seem to become the show's biggest talking point every year. 

'We've had plenty of complaints apparently, but none from home, let me tell you.'

Ashley has joined the BGT judging panel to fill in for Simon after he was forced to miss filming for the semi-finals after breaking his back.

The dancer rose to fame as part of the dance troupe Diversity, who were crowned BGT champions in 2009.

Along with choreographing Diversity's performances, Ashley has also appeared as a judge on Dancing On Ice since 2018, and went onto hint he'd be open to returning to the BGT judging panel in 2021.

He told The Mirror: 'I've heard Simon is planning to get back for the live final but a broken back isn't a small injury. I would never say never to judging the next series.

'I adore the show and would love to do it. I'm now in the BGT WhatsApp group.'

Ashley will join Amanda, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams on the new socially-distanced judging panel for the semi-finals, which are being pre-recorded for the first time in the show's history.

The remaining 40 hopefuls will be battling it out for a place in the grand final, which will air live in October.

Britain's Got Talent returns with the first semi-final on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.
