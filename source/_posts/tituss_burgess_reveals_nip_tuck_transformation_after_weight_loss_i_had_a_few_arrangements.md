The talented actor looked absolutely fantastic in a red Lee Rickie Collection track jacket and shorts combination featuring alligator leather detailings.

He completed the high fashion monochrome look with a pair of matching red Giuseppe Zanotti sneakers which are a favorite among celebs.

The actor even had hair on his head as opposed to his normal bald look.

The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star recently took to social media to quote the new Walter Mercado documentary on Netflix, Mucho Mucho Amor, and quoted the late astrologist by saying: 'I had a few arrangements.'

Tituss appeared from home on E!’s Live from the Red Carpet Special where he talked about his recent procedure.

He explained: 'That’s exactly what I had, Walter Mercado arrangements, if I’m going to be perfectly honest with you. I have nothing to hide! I even talked about it on social media.

Before: Burgess seen in May 2015

'The one thing I wanted to do during this time off was have some nip tuck surgery because my weight has gone up and down. And so after that happens, the skin gets a little saggy so I got that s–t cut off. This is the results and I look amazing.'

Titus has been nominated four times for his Netflix series and then was nominated for TV movie Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy Vs The Reverend and lost out to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.

 He can soon be seen alongside Jennifer Hudson, Forest Whitaker, and Audra McDonald in Aretha Franklin biopic Respect which is set for release in January 15, 2021.
