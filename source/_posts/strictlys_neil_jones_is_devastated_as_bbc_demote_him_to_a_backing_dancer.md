Strictly Come Dancing star Neil Jones has reportedly been left 'devastated' after the BBC's decision to demote him to a backing dancer for the upcoming series.

Bosses have decided not to pair Neil, 38, - who joined the show as a professional dancer in 2016 - with a celebrity this year. 

It was only last year that Neil was given a celebrity partner for the first time and it will no doubt come as a shock as he managed to finish in fifth place with former footballer Alex Scott.

Instead he will have a reduced role as a background dancer and a member of group routines, according to reports in The Star.   

Neil is said to be 'devastated' by the decision. 

A show insider told the publication: 'After a lot of discussion it was decided that Neil will be dropped from the line-up of professional dancers, so he won't be partnered with a contestant. 

'He will still be part of the show, but only in group ­routines. So viewers won't see much of him any more.' 

Happier times: Neil was part of Strictly's ensemble of pro dancers for three years before he finally got to be part of the competition last year when he was paired with former footballer Alex Scott, 35

Neil was part of Strictly's ensemble of pro dancers for three years before he finally got to be part of the competition last year when he was paired with Alex, 35.

It comes as his ex Katya Jones, 31, is tipped to be part of the show's first same-sex couple with Nicola Adams, 37.

The insider added: 'It's tough for Neil to take this news. He only had one year as a competing pro and now he's a background dancer once again.

'This year he will watch Katya be the centre of attention while he sits on the sidelines.' 

Neil's role may have been cut because this year's ­contest will feature fewer ­couples than usual. 

The coronavirus ­pandemic has forced the BBC to slash the number of episodes and start a month later than planned, with just 12 pairings ­instead of 15.

The new series, which starts next month on BBC One, will see celebs including Caroline Quentin, 60, and Bill Bailey, 55, compete for the Glitterball trophy.
