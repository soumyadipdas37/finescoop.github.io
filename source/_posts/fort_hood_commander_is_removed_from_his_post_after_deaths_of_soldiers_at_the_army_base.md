Major General Scott Efflandt 

The commander of Fort Hood has been removed from his post following the suspicious deaths of several soldiers including Vanessa Guillen at the army base. 

Major General Scott Efflandt has been removed from his position as commander of the base and will also no longer take on the role of commander of a division at Fort Bliss, the US Army announced in a statement Tuesday.  

The army will announce the name of a new commander for the 1st Armored Division in the coming days, the statement read.

The decision comes after the base in Killeen, Texas, has been plagued by at least 15 fatalities and disappearances of soldiers. 

The commanding general of US Army Forces Command, Gen. Michael Garrett, has directed Maj. Gen. John Richardson IV to formally assume the role of acting commander at Fort Hood from Wednesday, the statement read.  

Efflandt will stay on at Fort Hood for the time being, serving as deputy commanding general for support until the new commander is assigned to the role.

The army also announced that Garrett will appoint Gen. John Murray, commanding general of US Futures Command, to 'lead an in-depth investigation into the chain of command actions related to Spc. Vanessa Guillen.' 

There are several open investigations at Fort Hood already with this investigation taking a 'more complete and comprehensive investigation that will delve into all activities and levels of leadership'. 

The investigation will also be separate from the Independent Review of Fort Hood, which began back in August.

Last week, the body of Sgt. Elder Fernandes, 23, was discovered after he went missing back on August 17.

Fernandes was not reported missing for two days. 

It then emerged he had claimed he was being sexually abused by a male superior prior to his disappearance.

This came after the April disappearance of 20-year-old soldier Vanessa Guillen, who vanished after telling her family she was being sexually harassed. 

Her dismembered body was discovered in July.

Fellow soldier Spc. Aaron Robinson, 20, killed and dismembered Guillen and had the remains disposed of in nearby woods, federal and state investigators said.

Guillen's family said she told them before she vanished that she was being sexually harassed by Robinson.
