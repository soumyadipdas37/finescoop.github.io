Fancy an August bank holiday staycation stay somewhere sensational?

These Airbnb properties fit the bill - remarkably they are still available to book for the weekend of the 28th.

If relaxing in a tranquil rural idyll is your cup of tea, allow us to point you in the direction of a cosy Yorkshire shepherd’s hut set in an orchard, a gypsy caravan in a ‘boho glamping ground’ and a trio of snug huts just minutes from Stonehenge.

But perhaps a majestic castle is your preference.

No problem – there are rooms in a breathtaking 16th-century Scottish tower you can rent. It’s Game of Thrones – with mod cons.

There’s a houseboat on a private London island and a stunningly renovated widebeam canal boat by Tower Bridge up for grabs, too. Scroll down for all the details...



Beech nut shepherd's hut, Stamford Bridge, Yorkshire - £91 a night





Nestled in the corner of an apple, damson and pear orchard at the bottom of the owners' garden, this 'surprisingly roomy' shepherd's hut is 'a cosy, elegantly furnished place to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life'. It can house two adults in a double bed and a child in a day bed. Guests have access to a fridge, washer and microwave in the owners' utility room. Activities include star-gazing, wiping the sleep out of your eyes as the aroma of freshly baked bread fills the nostrils in the morning and wandering hither and thither around the working farm the hut is situated on. 'Hopefully any mooing, baa-ing and the occasional woof won't intrude on your stay!' say the owners

Attractive riverside houseboat on a private island, Hampton Court - £400pn





Host Anna's 'attractive riverside home' sits on a 'trendy island' and guests have a rowing boat they can use at their leisure 'to visit shops and bars'. Previous guests at the three-bed property, which sleeps six, gush about the experience. 'Andreana' said 'perfect location, great accommodation, great communication from host', while 'Hilary' said 'it is a lovely peaceful and calm little oasis'

Quirky glamping fun, central riverside location, York - £62 a night 



The famous Shambles - an ancient street festooned with timber-framed dwellings - is just minutes from this quirky 'glamping cabin', which sleeps two in a bunk bed. Previous guest 'Sarah' said that she thoroughly enjoyed her stay. The location, she stated, was 'spot on'. 'Finlay', meanwhile, said that the hosts were 'lovely' and 'very accommodating', but that the space is 'not for the faint-hearted'. Intriguing...

Luxury garden studio apartment, Silverstone - £275 a night 





Petrolheads will surely find this one-bedroom self-contained apartment situated in a huge garden irresistible - it's just a 10-minute walk from Silverstone Circuit. The main attraction would appear to be a five-person hot tub that's 'perfect for cosy evenings under the stars'. Previous guest Ciaran described the property as an 'amazing tiny house' set amid 'beautiful scenery'

Shepherd's huts, Salisbury, Wiltshire - £88 a night





The owners claim these three huts - set in the courtyard of a 19th-century inn - are the closest properties to mystical Stonehenge (a seven-minute drive away). Each hut sleeps two in one bedroom and has a shower, toilet and Wi-Fi - and there's a huge firepit to keep proceedings extra snug. 'Great location and the hospitality was top notch,' said previous guest 'Tristam'

Romantic gypsy caravan, Ratcliffe Culey, Leicestershire, £85 a night 





This 'beautifully painted' Romany gypsy caravan - 'Mary Jane' - with room for two has a 'narrow wardrobe for clothes, so only bring what makes you feel fabulous' says the host. It's likely you'll feel fabulous regardless of apparel if you stay here, though. It's set in a 'Boho glamping ground' called 'Ettie's Field' - 'a wonderful place, with a truly spectacular bohemian feel clubhouse and terrace where you can relax and enjoy a drink and a chat'. The views are 'beautiful', according to reviewer 'John', and Mary Jane is 'full of character and charm'. The host adds: 'In the evening, the place becomes wreathed with fairy lights as the chickens come home to roost and the alpacas and donkeys settle down for the night'

The Tower, Thornton Castle, Aberdeenshire - £145 a night 





It's Game of Thrones with mod cons at Thornton Castle, which dates from the 13th century. There are two bedrooms to rent in the L-shaped 16th-century tower. The main room has a superking-sized bed and the other one, up a stone spiral staircase, has twin beds. There's a billiard room on the ground floor, full breakfast provided in the dining room and chickens and ducks in the garden. 'There may well be fresh eggs for breakfast,' says the host. Reviewer Ian's verdict? 'Thornton Castle is everything you would want from a Scottish castle'

'Stunning' one bedroom boat in St Katharine Docks, London - £214 a night 





This stunning widebeam canal boat - the Dusky Parakeet - which sleeps two, is moored mere steps from Tower Bridge and the Tower of London. The interior, designed by award-winning architects 31/44, features handmade fittings, underfloor heating, a double bed and a fully equipped kitchen. Over to reviewer Benjamin Jay for the verdict: 'An exceptional stay in the most magnificent of places'

Shepherds hut and Arctic hut set in private woods, Oxfordshire - £150 a night 





If you want to disconnect from the hullaballoo of working life then this could be the place for you - 'a beautiful shepherd's hut and a cute Arctic BBQ hut in an exclusive private field surrounded by private woodland'. There is no internet, limited mobile phone signal and no TV, says the host - but there are beautiful views, woodpeckers and four dogs, two cats and two ponies 'which may pop over to visit'. The hut sleeps two and guests have exclusive use of 25 acres of woodland

All accommodation free on various days over the 2020 August bank holiday weekend at the time of writing. Other accommodation sites are available.
