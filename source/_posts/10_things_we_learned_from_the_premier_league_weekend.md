It was a Premier League weekend so jam-packed with goals it wouldn't have looked out of place in sepia tone.

Thirty-nine over the course of eight matches on Saturday and Sunday with two fixtures still to come on Monday evening.

But while we cannot fault the entertainment factor in the 'best league in the world', it might be wise to question whether anything has changed.

Mendy will be straight into the Chelsea team after another Kepa catastrophe

Sometimes you do wonder about some of the things that come out of manager's mouths.

Frank Lampard came out after Chelsea's defeat by Liverpool and pledged to restore Kepa Arrizabalaga's confidence after gifting Sadio Mane his second goal.

Presumably he will do this by dropping him and playing new boy Edouard Mendy, who is poised to complete his transfer from Rennes.

Frank Lampard needs to show a ruthless streak and drop Kepa otherwise Chelsea will slip back

We all know that Lampard has a ruthless streak and he needs to show it if Chelsea are to challenge for any honours this season.

This was one mistake too far for a £72million keeper and though Kepa's confidence will be shot, you simply cannot continue turning a blind eye when someone is costing you vital points.

Mendy, who will cost £26m, arrives in the nice position of almost certainly being a safer pair of hands than the current incumbent of the gloves.

Liverpool's early statement proves they're still the team to beat

Many a Premier League manager will have watched Liverpool's slack defending against Leeds last week and seen a glimmer of hope.

But that was comprehensively blocked out as the reigning champions won comfortably at Chelsea to make an early statement that they remain the team to beat.

While Chelsea were the architects of their own downfall in parts, Liverpool applied constant pressure and pinned them back.

Many hoped that Liverpool would fall short but actually they've evolved and progressed

Thiago Alcantara completed more passes in 45 minutes than any Chelsea player did in 90

Jurgen Klopp's side have evolved and improved as well. Thiago Alcantara only came on at half-time but still completed more passes in 45 minutes than any Chelsea player across 90.

That's what champions need to do. While there's clearly not a need for a drastic overhaul, improvement in just one or two areas can keep them moving forwards.

Such a mantra was sacrosanct when Liverpool's great teams of the 1970s and 1980s won the title year after year. It keeps you ahead of the pack.

It'll be a long slog of a season for United without investment

Forget Tottenham, we need a fly-on-the-wall documentary commissioned about Manchester United's season.

After guiding them back into the Champions League, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer might have expected a little more investment in the transfer market this summer.

In the wake of Saturday's miserable defeat by Crystal Palace, the need for new signings is more painfully obvious than ever.

Victor Lindelof didn't start the season in the best fashion as Man United lost to Crystal Palace

Ed Woodward will need to go out and spend with United struggling in several departments

Trouble is, it's a bit of a whack-a-mole situation for United. They signed Donny van de Beek to bolster the midfield, but then it's clear they urgently need a new centre-half.

The summer priorities were a right-sided attacker and a left-back but so far they've signed neither.

The current team already look knackered after what was their shortest pre-season ever and there's going to be no let-up.

Yes, finances are tight with stadiums sitting empty but if United don't sign one or two players between now and October 5, it will be a season of regret and the steady progress made under Solskjaer will be undone.

Clubs need to ensure their players know the rules

There have always been tweaks and little changes to the rules ahead of new seasons, usually with officials required to clamp down on something or other.

It's been well publicised that the rule on what constitutes a handball has been changed so anything below the shirt sleeve line or the armpit is a handball and contact with the shoulder is not.

The element of the arm being in an unnatural position - i.e. away from the body - has remained.

Lindelof concedes a penalty for handball during United's defeat to Palace on Saturday night 

David de Gea didn't understand - or had forgotten - he needed to have a foot on the line

Yet United's Victor Lindelof appeared nonplussed when VAR awarded a penalty against him in the Palace game.

Likewise, David de Gea was punished for not having at least one part of his foot touching the goalline as Jordan Ayew took his penalty, which was saved.

VAR spotted this and allowed a re-take, which Wilfried Zaha tucked away.

Surely clubs - and law-makers - need to be thoroughly briefing players on any changes to the rules before each season.

Kane, Son, Bale… Tottenham could actually be devastating

Tottenham's early season odyssey will take them from Leyton Orient to Macedonia in the space of 48 hours next week.

But when the fixture pile-up eases a little bit and Jose Mourinho gets time with his squad on the training ground, we could see the makings of a truly devastating forward three.

Harry Kane set up Son Heung-min four times before scoring himself in Sunday's 5-2 demolition of Southampton.

Those two up front along with Gareth Bale and Tottenham could be a devastating prospect

Those two have now combined for 24 goals in all in Premier League football.

Add Gareth Bale to the mix when he recovers from the knee problem flagged up in his Spurs medical last week and there may just be a chance that long wait for some silverware comes to an end.

With Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn in reserve as Spurs cope with the Europa League slog, they may well have one of the best attacks in the Premier League.

Naturally, this is assuming everyone stays fit and in form but if Jose can get his forwards working in harmony, he may even raise a smile.

Arsenal are winning games they would have drawn or lost last year

Mikel Arteta was correct. Arsenal probably would have lost - or more likely drawn - Saturday night's match against West Ham a year ago.

Having seen Michail Antonio cancel out their early advantage, the doubts would have crept in, passes would have come slapdash, the creativity would have dried up. The Hammers might have nicked it.

Instead it was Eddie Nketiah scoring in the dying minutes to secure the three points, with Arteta pointing to a different mentality in his squad.

Eddie Nketiah has a good scoring rate for Arsenal and Arteta is moulding him into a top player

It could be interpreted as a little dig at predecessor Unai Emery but there has been a visible improvement since he took over.

His faith in Nketiah, 21, is a good example and Arteta clearly believes he can mould the youngster into a top class centre forward.

Nketiah doesn't get too many minutes for Arsenal but when he does he invariably finds the target and Leeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa was disappointed when Arsenal recalled him from last season's loan.

Slowly but surely, Arteta is rebuilding Arsenal.

James has wasted little time adapting to the Premier League

Seldom have so many summer signings settled into a team so quickly.

Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure played well as Everton overcame a West Brom side who possessed a self-destructive streak on Saturday.

But James Rodriguez was the star of the show, the Colombian already confounding those doubters who thought he'd sink in the Premier League.

James Rodriguez was a cut above as Everton overcame West Brom at Goodison on Saturday

His home debut was marked with a sweetly-taken left-foot strike and a corner assist for Dominic Calvert-Lewin to complete his hat-trick.

There was also the dreamy ball over the Baggies' defence to spring Richarlison to tee up Calvert-Lewin for the fourth.

It earned him a warm embrace from Carlo Ancelotti when he was subbed off late on and though it remains early days, the confidence seems to be flowing again.

Lamptey lights the way to a better season for Brighton

It's way too early to be claiming that Tariq Lamptey is the one that got away for Chelsea.

After all, it's far from certain he'd be playing in the Chelsea first team ahead of the likes of Reece James and Cesar Azpilicueta.

But it's clear the teenager's tough decision to leave Stamford Bridge to seek more game time at Brighton is paying off.

Tariq Lamptey was again excellent as Brighton won 3-0 at Newcastle on Sunday afternoon

Lamptey, 19, made just three appearances for Chelsea and it's highly unlikely he would have added to that a great deal this season.

Instead, he's making a name for himself elsewhere, running rings around Newcastle in Brighton's 3-0 win at St James' Park on Sunday.

Coming through Chelsea's academy doesn't entitle you to a shot in their first team.

What it does give you is a top notch footballing education and grounding that allows you to flourish elsewhere.

Leeds offer entertainment but it might not be good for them

Wouldn't it be great if every Leeds United game finishes 4-3 one way or the other this season.

Marcelo Bielsa won't allow his team to play with the handbrake on and it's already fascinating to see how the Argentine's philosophies apply to Premier League football.

Saturday's win over Fulham came despite real struggles with Aleksandar Mitrovic's physicality, with Bielsa admitting his defenders couldn't cope with him.

Aleksandar Mitrovic caused the Leeds United defence all kinds of problems on Saturday

Summer signing Robin Koch also clearly needs more time to adjust to the Premier League after conceding another penalty.

But their swashbuckling play going forward means all this deficiency at the back is overlooked.

There may come a time this season when Bielsa will need to become more pragmatic. But don't bank on it.

Burnley are already at breaking point

Sean Dyche hasn't exactly made a secret of Burnley's pressing need for squad reinforcements.

Yet with just two weeks of the window left, their only signed players are a load of academy scholars and a back-up keeper.

A weakness in defence was apparent in their defeat at Leicester although Ben Mee and James Tarkowski were missing and Jimmy Dunne was making his Premier League debut.

Sean Dyche's Burnley squad is at breaking point with seemingly no budget for new signings

Tarkowski could yet be sold and it would only take an injury or two for Dyche to be struggling to field a team worthy of the Premier League.

Surely after all his years of service, keeping the Clarets punching well above their weight, Dyche deserves a bit of budget for new signings?

All the while, the odds on Burnley's relegation shorten.
