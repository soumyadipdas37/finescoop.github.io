A former beauty queen has been detained on suspicion of attempted murder after a 'random knife attack' on a shopworker.

Natalya Dolganovskaya, 32, was heard shouting 'I hate women' as she repeatedly stabbed her victim, said reports citing law enforcement.

The detained woman was crowned Miss Ulyanovsk in 2005, and had been a well known local model.  

CCTV video footage shows how a 36-year-old saleswoman was attacked at the fruit and vegetable section in supermarket Gulliver.

The attacker was finally stopped by another member of staff and a customer who rushed to the scene.

A woman worker grabbed the knife from the female attacker in a scuffle on the floor. A shopper helped stop the blood streaming knife wounds until paramedics arrived.

The victim is now in intensive care with seven serious wounds to her head, face, neck, hands and spine. Her life is not in danger, say reports.

The former beauty queen was detained by police and members of Russian's Investigative Committee after fleeing the scene.

A witness said the attacker 'suddenly went berserk in the supermarket'.

After winning her beauty crown aged 18, Dolganovskaya wed a local tycoon and politician named Vadim Dolganovsky, but the marriage ended childless six years later.

She continued to work in a store owned by her ex-husband after the split.

He remarried after the breakup, while she had problems getting her life back on track, said friends.

Her mother Elena Pimenova told NTV after her daughter was held by police that Dolganovskaya told her: 'I have a feeling that some demons have clung to me.'

Law enforcement said it was treating the knifing as a random and unprovoked attack.

'The Investigative Committee in Ulyanovsk region has opened a criminal case into the attempted murder of a resident of Ulyanovsk,' said a statement.

Detectives are seeking 'to establish all the circumstances of the incident'.

Forensic examinations have been carried out and an assessment will be made on the suspect's mental state.
