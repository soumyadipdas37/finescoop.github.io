Gogglebox's Isabelle Silbery has spoken about her relationship with new fiancé, Alex Richards.

The reality star, 34, told New Idea, Alex has 'shown her exactly what real love is' after she was left heartbroken following her split from her ex-boyfriend Luke Gordon last year.

'I was so heartbroken and I honestly thought no-one was ever going to love me that way again but Alex has shown me exactly what real love is,' she said.

She also revealed she met her fiancé on Instagram shortly after she announced her split from Luke in January after less than one year of dating.

'Three months after my break-up I finally found the courage to share it on Instagram,' she said.

'I received a message from Alex, who had gone through his own traumatic break-up and realised we had a friend in common, Georgia Love, who gave me the green light on his credentials,' she explained.

Isabelle announced her split from her longtime boyfriend Luke in January, revealing they'd broken up 'before Christmas'.

'Letting him go has hit me hard,' she wrote on Instagram at the time.

In March, she moved in with Alex, and wrote about their experience living together so early on in their relationship in an editorial for Kidspot at the time.

'Being in such close proximity to one another sure is a test of getting to know each other, fast...' she wrote.

'There's always a laugh and a cuddle at the end of the day, which is a nice feeling.'

Meanwhile, in July, Isabella announced her engagement Alex after dating for just six months.

The 34-year-old shared the happy news on Instagram, alongside a loved-up photo of herself cupping her beau's face and showing off her ring.

'This happened...and I said yes. To a man who truly sees me, understands me & loves me for all my idiosyncrasies,' she wrote.
