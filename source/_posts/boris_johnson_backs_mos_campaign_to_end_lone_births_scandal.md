Boris Johnson has backed The Mail on Sunday's campaign to end lone births, saying 'no woman should have to go through labour alone'.

Nearly half of hospital Trusts continue to ban partners from attending either labour or scans, or both, because of draconian Covid-19 rules.

This newspaper is campaigning to end the scandal, which has left women to give birth or receive devastating news of miscarriages without support.

The Prime Minister said it is of 'upmost importance' that every hospital allows partners to be present in what are 'incredibly special moments in people's lives'.

The Government has published guidelines on how hospitals can safely do this, but many Trusts are refusing to implement it. Mr Johnson told The Mail on Sunday: 'No woman should have to go through labour alone without the support of partners or loved ones.'

'The guidance has changed to ensure pregnant women can have someone with them for vital appointments and throughout the birth of their child.'

He said Ministers have been working with NHS England to ensure every hospital follows the guidance. Since The Mail on Sunday launched the campaign last weekend, several Trusts have performed U-turns.

In one victory, Ruth Watson, whose husband had been banned from attending her 36-week scan tomorrow, was told he could be there after this newspaper reported her concerns.

Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, said: 'Wherever possible mums should be able to be accompanied by their partners for scans, antenatal visits and of course for childbirth. The Mail on Sunday is quite right to highlight the importance of getting this right.'

The chief midwife will be putting more pressure on hospitals that continue to ban partners from attending.

But former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says more action is needed to ensure all NHS trusts change their policies.

Writing in today's Mail on Sunday, he says: 'I don't think a voluntary framework will end the arbitrary way these rules are being applied by some hospitals. A postcode lottery is unacceptable.'

A petition to allow partners at all stages of labour into all hospitals has attracted more than 418,000 signatures. Joeli Brearley of campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed said: 'Pregnant women must be a priority considering the impact stress has on a growing foetus.'
