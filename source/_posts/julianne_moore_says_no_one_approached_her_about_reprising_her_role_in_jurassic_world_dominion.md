Julianne Moore revealed that 'no one approached' her about reprising her character behavioral paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding in Colin Trevorrow's 2021 flick Jurassic World: Dominion.

'Yeah, Sarah Harding. Maybe she's not done yet. I don't know,' the 59-year-old Oscar winner told Collider last Friday.

'But no one has approached me. That's okay! But if they did? Yeah, sure! Of course, of course!'

Ouch! Julianne Moore revealed that 'no one approached' her about reprising her character behavioral paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding in Colin Trevorrow's 2021 flick Jurassic World: Dominion

The 59-year-old Oscar winner told Collider last Friday: 'Yeah, Sarah Harding. Maybe she's not done yet. I don't know. But no one has approached me. That's okay! But if they did? Yeah, sure!'

Steven Spielberg's forgettable 1997 sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park managed to amass $618.6M at the global box office despite dismal reviews.

However, Julianne's former onscreen leading man Jeff Goldblum is already at Pinewood Studios resuming his part as chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm alongside Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard.

'I think people may be underestimating the size and importance of Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum's characters in this movie,' the 44-year-old director told SYFY WIRE.

Sorry Jules!  However, Julianne's former onscreen leading man Jeff Goldblum is already at Pinewood Studios resuming his part as chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm alongside Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard 

The 44-year-old director told SYFY WIRE: 'I think people may be underestimating the size and importance of Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum's characters in this movie'

'It is very much an ensemble and that element, the ability to take these beloved characters from almost 30 years now, and understand how they interact with each other in the context of a world that we've really never seen before and have not been able to witness until now. 

'It's very exciting for me. I'm having the time of my life.'
