 She's known for her stunning good looks and girls' girl personality. 

And Maya Jama was showcasing her model-worthy beauty as she graced the cover of Wonderland Magazine for a sensational new shoot. 

The model, 26, spoke to the Autumn 2020 edition of the fashion tome about her resilient attitude as well as showing off her stunning figure in a series of outfits. 

WOAH! Maya Jama was showcasing her model-worthy beauty as she graced the cover of Wonderland Magazine for a sensational new shoot

Maya was radiant in the stunning cover snap as she was dripping in Omega and Bvlgari diamonds while giving her all to her cover-girl worthy pose. 

Clutching her arms across her chest, she was preened to perfection, with her lips laden with gloss and the rest of her make-up flawlessly applied. 

Inside the magazine it was bold and beautiful in pink as she luxuriated on a couch while flaunting her endless legs and perfect curves. 

It was high octane-drama for the rest of the shoot as she also posed in a dress with a perilously high slit extending to her svelte waist.

Another breathtaking look from the shoot saw Maya wow in a voluminous pink dress with frothy layers of frills and materials upping the drama to full. 

Speaking in the magazine, the TV and radio host said: 'I definitely think I’m resilient. Sometimes I surprise myself, because there’s been a few times...

'I feel like oh my God, this is the end of the world — and then it’s not the end of the world. And then I’m back.'

The stunning shoot comes as Maya recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs.

The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.  

Speaking during a Q&A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it's like, 'This is this, it's everybody's business'.'

Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heavy Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.  

He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew's still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. 

'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn't down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that's my one desire.'
