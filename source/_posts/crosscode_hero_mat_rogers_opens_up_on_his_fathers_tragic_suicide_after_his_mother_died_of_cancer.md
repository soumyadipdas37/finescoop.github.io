Former Australian football star Mat Rogers is working to normalise conversations about mental health in Australia after his father tragically took his own life.

The 44-year-old is among iconic Australian sportsmen including Greg Inglis and Buddy Franklin trying to break down the stigmas surrounding mental health.

These issues fall close to home for Rogers, who lost his father and Cronulla Sharks NRL legend Steve to suicide in 2006 at just 51 years old.

Rogers lost his mother Carol to breast cancer in 2001 and an uncle to suicide.

He hopes his work will inspire people who are feeling down to speak up.

'It’s like when you ask someone the question and they’re not OK, they don’t even know where to start. It’s been a lightning rod for their life, that opportunity to speak to someone who is prepared to try and understand them,' he told SMART Daily.

Rogers has fought with his own mental demons throughout his life and thought feeling strained and gloomy was something that ran in his family.

The dual-international said the stress of being an athlete and celebrity weighs up on sports stars leaving them lost and alone at the close of their playing career.

He said his father's suicide made his friends nervous about bringing up the subject to him in his darkest days. 

'That was not my Dad and not my Dad’s legacy, that was a moment in time where he succumbed to the darkness of what he was feeling,' Rogers said. 'I honestly think it’s held back him being recognised as the great player he was.'

Rogers acknowledged that 'life's hard' and has had to learn to manage himself to appreciate what he has been blessed with.

The former Queensland Origin star is working in sports management with children and trying to implement his values into athletes in their youth. 

He said having a conversation with friends and family and checking in to see if they are doing okay can make a world of difference. 

'It’s also important we’re all vigilant as individuals for the people around us. I’ve been in some pretty dark places and the last thing I’ve wanted to do was bring other people into them but I have been fortunate in having a great brother, wife and friends who have been able to recognise that and step in,' he said.
