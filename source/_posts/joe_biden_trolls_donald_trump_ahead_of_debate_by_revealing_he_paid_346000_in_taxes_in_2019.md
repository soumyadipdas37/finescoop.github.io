Joe Biden released his and running mate Kamala Harris' latest tax returns on Tuesday, ahead of the first presidential debate, and after a report President Donald Trump only paid $750 in taxes for 2016 and 2017.

Biden's taxes showed that he and his wife Jill paid more than $346,000 in federal taxes and other payments for 2019 on an income of nearly $985,000 before seeking a refund of nearly $47,000.

The 2019 tax returns for Biden's running mate Senator Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, a lawyer who has taken leave from his position as a partner with the firm DLA Piper, were also released.

The couple paid $754,809 on an income of $3,018,127.

'This is a historic level of transparency meant to give the American people faith once again that their leaders will look out for them and not their own bottom lines,' Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said on a call with reporters.

'Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up,' she added.
