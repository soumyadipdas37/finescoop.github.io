She recently split from her boyfriend Tom Brazier. 

Yet Laura Anderson revealed she hadn't given up on love as she dished out some relationship advice to her followers on Tuesday. 

In an Instagram Q&A, the Love Island star admitted she had 'made a few mistakes' in the past as she helped her fans with their own problems. 

It's over: She recently split from her boyfriend Tom Brazier. Yet Laura Anderson revealed she hadn't given up on love as she dished out some relationship advice to her followers

Asked when the 'right time' is to end a relationship, Laura mused that it's ok to move on', as she explained, 'don't feel bad about wasting your time on someone else'.

She admitted that she could see the dilemma however, as she would 'rather be dumped' than have to dump someone herself as break ups are so 'difficult'.

Reflecting on her own experiences, Laura revealed that she spent five years letting a former flame in and out of her life as she helped a fan who wanted to 'move on' from an ex. 

Laura said: 'The reason you can't get over him is because you're letting him come in and out of your life. That needs to be a block, delete situation. 

'You obviously like the attention, which we all do, but it's a no from me'.

The straight-talking Scot went on to offer some advice on how to get through a break up, stating that 'time is a healer'. 

She added: 'Getting over someone is just like breaking a habit, like the texting in the morning and the evening, little things you used to do together. 

'You just need to do new things and sort of like, text your friend instead of him'.

The Q&A comes after Laura revealed she split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom just days after moving back to Scotland.

Despite initially intending for Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off.  

Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north.

'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.'

Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.

Laura, who moved to the swanky Park Circus area of Glasgow earlier in the month, said she had fully hoped Tom would join her in her new home.

She had gushed that she'd never met anyone like him before adding: 'I'm still going to move to Scotland and Tom is looking to follow me up in the next six months. He's the cherry on top of the cake.'

Laura first rose to fame for her appearance on the 2018 edition of Love Island, where she embarked on ill-fated relationships with Wes Nelson and Paul Knops.

After leaving the villa, the bombshell dated series one winner Max Morley in October.

The duo were in an on-off relationship, with the stars splitting in December, reuniting in May 2019, and eventually calling it quits for good in July last year.
