 Josephine was surrounded by everyone from a beauty touch up team, to brand representatives as well as a slew of cameras as she strutted her stuff for the commercial shoot. 

Her look was a pair of magenta satin trousers with a buckled detail and a black crop top with cutouts on the side. 

She overlayed the look with a black trench coat and a pair of black ankle boots that had a sock like detail. 

She kept her jewelry to a minimum wearing just earrings and rings, sometimes adjusting them between shots as she listened for direction.

 Back in May it was revealed that Josephine's wedding to her rocker fiance Alexander DeLeon aka Bohnes, 31, would have to be postponed due to the pandemic. 

The couple who have been engaged since 2018, had planned to tie the knot but have since pushed it to next year to protect the safety of their friends and family. 

Speaking to People magazine Skriver said, 'We have been together for so long we basically feel married already so waiting another year is turning out to be okay for us'. 

The two have been in a loving seven year relationship after getting together in 2013. 

The couple who are based in Nashville have been spending a lot of time together in quarantine with Alex focusing on his art and Josephine doing at home photo shoots ahead of the modeling industry opening slowly and safely.
