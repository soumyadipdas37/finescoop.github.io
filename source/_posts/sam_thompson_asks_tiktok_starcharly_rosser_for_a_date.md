Newly single Sam Thompson has asked TikTok star Charly Rosser on a dinner date as he endeavours to move on from his abrupt split with Zara McDermott.

The Made In Chelsea regular, 28, confirmed his split with former Love Island contestant Zara in September after discovering she cheated on him in 2019, shortly after they embarked on a relationship.

And Sam – who was last seen publicly in the company of a pretty brunette on Saturday evening – has since asked Charly out after she referenced him in a recent video.

With lines including  'I like you, I don't give a f*** about the girlfriend,' and 'wait... you don't have a girlfriend?' Charley appeared to make her feelings clear as she danced in front of superimposed images of Sam.

Sam was last seen enjoying a night out at Amazonica in London on Saturday with a stunning mystery woman, just over a week after his split from Zara was confirmed.

The pair left the restaurant together and were spotted sharing an animated conversation outside.

Sam had returned to his London home over the weekend after spending a few days in Suffolk with his sister and MIC co-star Louise and her boyfriend Ryan Libbey.

Zara was also spotted out in London on Saturday night, hitting Novikov restaurant in Mayfair with some friends.

Sam's close friend Pete Wicks recently admitted he has warned him against getting back with Zara t following the couple's shock split. 

In an exclusive interview wit MailOnline, Pete, 31, revealed that he believes some people 'try to pull the wool over Sam's eyes' and he's not enjoyed seeing his friend 'so down.'

He said: 'Sam is like the brother I never had and never wanted. He's a great guy and has a heart of gold.

'Although we're from different backgrounds and people assume we wouldn't get on, we do spend a lot of time with each other.

'He's had a rough time recently. If there's one person that is probably worse when it comes to dating than me, it's Sam Thompson.

'Sam overthinks everything – I have never known anyone to overthink like he does. Sometimes I think he can be too nice. He's made mistakes, he's made a number of them but he's a really, really nice geezer and I think sometimes people try to pull the wool over his eyes.'

He added: 'It didn't work out for me trying to give things another go… as far as I'm concerned, what goes on between Sam and Zara isn't really my place to say until they come out and openly discuss everything.

'But in my opinion he needs to concentrate on himself and making himself happy. It's been a rough ride for him.

'It's not nice to see someone as down so as what he has been about it but he will bounce back, we all bounce back.'
