Phil Foden has revealed it was a 'dream come true' to make his England debut on Saturday. 

The Manchester City youngster played his part in the Three Lions' 1-0 victory over Iceland in their UEFA Nations League match.

And 20-year-old Foden was not feeling the pressure during a difficult match.

Foden told Sky Sports: 'It feels amazing, it's a dream come true. Just to make me debut today is a big moment for me and my family. 

'It was a very difficult game. They defended well, we showed great character to stay in the game. 

'To get the win is massive for the country. I didn't feel the pressure, we all just try to play our football. 

'Like I said before we showed great character and came through for the win. It's a very high standard in training.

'I just try to learn as much as I can. I want to keep playing for my country, not just a one-off. 

'Hopefully I can keep the shirt. We are going to go into the next game to make it two out of two and hopefully we can get the job done.' 

Raheem Sterling’s last-gasp spot-kick saved England’s blushes in Iceland as a tepid Nations League encounter came to a dramatic conclusion.

With March’s friendlies scrapped and Euro 2020 postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Three Lions returned with a whimper in front of empty stands in Reykjavik after their enforced 10-month break.

Harry Kane’s disallowed opener and Kyle Walker’s sending off looked to have been the key moments in Iceland, only for England to snatch a late 1-0 win as Birkir Bjarnason blazed over a penalty moments after Sterling slotted one home.
