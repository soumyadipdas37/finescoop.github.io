Big Brother's Kieran Davidson has already spent the $15,344 that he won during his time on the reality series.

The 21-year-old told The Wash that he's invested the money into his career as a YouTuber and content creator by buying some new equipment. 

'I purchased a brand new camera rig, drone and heaps of other equipment because I’m a videographer and need the equipment,' he explained.

Kieran currently boasts 26,000 followers on YouTube and 46,000 on Instagram.

The young star has already cashed in on his social media following and reality TV fame by launching a line of merchandise.

And he's not the only Big Brother cast member looking to stay in the spotlight, with  Garth Saville launching his own video podcast called In The Bath With Aunty Garth.

'I purchased a brand new camera rig, drone and heaps of other equipment because I’m a videographer and need the equipment,' he told The Wash  

'It will be a high energy and entertaining vodcast that will involve me interviewing and playing games with celebrities,' he told Daily Mail Australia last month. 

'It's going to be a feast to the eyes, allowing fans to get involved and ultimately decide how the show pans out.' 

'It'll be a chance to hear your favourite celebrities open up about some outrageous topics where no question or answer is taboo.'
