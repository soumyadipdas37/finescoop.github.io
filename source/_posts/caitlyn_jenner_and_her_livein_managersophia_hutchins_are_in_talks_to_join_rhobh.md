Two-time Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner and her live-in manager since 2018 - Sophia Hutchins - are 'in talks' with Bravo to join the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in season 11.

The 24-year-old LumaSol CEO has reportedly reached out to producers about becoming a 'friend' of the reality show with the 70-year-old transgender trailblazer as a full-blown Housewife.

'Sophia recently sat down for dinner with former RHOBH castmate Eileen Davidson,' a source told TMZ on Sunday.

'They chatted about Eileen's experience on the show and Sophia got enough good feedback that she decided RHOBH was something she wanted to do.'

Back on March 24, Hutchins and Jenner told ET they would both jump at the opportunity to join Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley, and Garcelle Beauvais 'in two seconds.'

'I honestly kind of got into it,' Caitlyn said.

'You know, I've done reality television pretty much all my life - sports is reality television - and I was watching that and saying, "I could see myself getting in there with some of the drama."'

The inseparable yet platonic gal pals - who met through a make-up artist - share similar conservative views, sense of humor, and passion for golfing.

Sophia (born Scott) told Pepperdine's Graphic she initially identified as a gay man until she saw then-Bruce's 20/20 interview about her gender affirmation in 2015.

Hutchins takes a 10% cut of Jenner's earnings and the constant companions share her $3.5M 11-acre four-bedroom Malibu hilltop home.
