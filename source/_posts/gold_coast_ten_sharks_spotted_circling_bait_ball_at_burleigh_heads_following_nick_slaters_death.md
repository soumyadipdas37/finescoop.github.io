Horrifying footage has shown the moment at least ten sharks swarmed a bait ball just 500 metres from a popular swimming beach.

Max Hinton, from Content Lion, caught the scene on his drone at Burleigh Heads, Gold Coast, Queensland on Friday.

The footage showed sharks close to the surface circling one of the fish bait balls.

Many more sharks were seen lurking deep below, all eager to get a taste of the dead animals left there as a way to prevent sharks from getting closer to shore.

'This was about 500 meters off-shore and completely took me by surprise how close it was and the scale of how many sharks there were,' Mr Hinton told Nine News.

Locals have been cautious about stepping into the water after a 46-year-old died just 15km away following a shark attack.

Nick Slater was fatally mauled while surfing near Greenmount Beach, on the Gold Coast tourist strip, at about 5pm on September 8. 

Early analysis of the tooth and the imprint of the animal's jaw on Mr Slater's surfboard revealed it was likely a 3.5m white pointer shark.

 Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed a large tiger shark was found tangled in a net off Greenmount Beach just hours after the tragedy.

'Further investigations will be conducted to discover if there is any link between it and the fatal attack,' Palaszczuk told state parliament.

Mr Slater suffered serious leg injuries and was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.

His death is only the second fatal shark attack at one of Queensland's 85 beaches that have been protected by nets and drum lines since 1962, the state government said.

Before nets were put in place, the last fatal shark attack off a Gold Coast beach - 24 of which are now netted - was in 1958.

Friday's footage prompted Surf Lifesaving  Queensland to issue a warning to all swimmers as school holidays is set to begin.

'Six roving jet skis rove from Southport down to the border, our Westpac rescue drones will be in the sky our Westpac rescue helicopter,' Nathan Fife, from the organisation, said.

'If [swimmers] do see any bait balls please stay well away.'
