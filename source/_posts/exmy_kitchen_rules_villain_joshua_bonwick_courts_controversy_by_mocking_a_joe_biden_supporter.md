Former My Kitchen Rules villain Joshua Bonwick has continued to court controversy by mocking a Joe Biden supporter. 

The 27-year-old, who relocated from Sydney to Los Angeles last year, zoomed in on a 'Biden for President' sticker on an unidentified person's vehicle in a clip shared to his Instagram Stories on Wednesday. 

'Hey d***head! [He] can't even close his gasoline properly and look who he's voting for!' the former reality star fumed.

While the Australian is unable to vote in the United States Presidential Election, he has made it clear that he doesn't support the country's Democratic nominee, former Vice President, Joe Biden.

This comes after Joshua and his former MKR contestant Romel Kouyan passionately defended the show's former judge Pete Evans and many of his controversial views.

In an interview shared on their respective Instagram accounts, the pair praised the conspiracy theorist and anti-vaxxer, 47, for leaving behind his fame and fortune to 'expose what's going on' during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Singing Pete's praises, Bonwick declared that the world was 'in need of more people like him' while 43-year-old Kouyan admitted he 'loves everything he stands for' and was 'right behind him'.

The pair leapt to Pete's defence while discussing the strict lockdown measures in coronavirus-riddled Melbourne.

Josh, who relocated from Sydney to Los Angeles last year, expressed relief that he wasn't currently living in Melbourne, where people didn't have a 'bill of rights' and a 'constitution that protects your human rights.'

He immediately cited Pete as a hero for 'exposing and shining a light' on the pandemic.

'He has thrown away every single thing that everyone in the world is trying to attain. He had success, he's famous, he was on TV and had a million dollar a year job. He's thrown it all away to expose what's going on!

'We need more people like Pete Evans. The more backlash that you get means you're on to something,' he added.

Romel shared the same views as Joshua, adding: 'He is definitely one of the smartest individuals I have ever met in my whole life. I love what he stands for.

'What I admire about him is that he's not afraid to hold back. He could easily say, "you know what? I've got a career online, so I'll keep my opinions to myself and just look after my family."

'But he's going on a huge platform and sharing these opinions.'

Romel defiantly continued: 'It actually upsets me seeing the backlash he receives because the world needs people like Pete Evans.

'We need people like him to shine the light on situations that may or may not be real. We can't all be stupid. We can't all be following things we're told by the media.

'So I'm grateful to have him. I stand right behind him, and I back him.'

Pete has also been embroiled in a string of controversies since departing Channel Seven earlier this year.

His opinions: He was recently invited on 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network

He was recently invited on 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network.

Despite sharing misleading information about immunisation over the years, Pete has insisted he is not an 'anti-vaxxer' but 'pro-choice for medical freedom'.

However, there is no such thing as being 'pro-choice' regarding vaccinations. People who do not vaccinate their children are putting the community at unnecessary risk.

Pete has claimed on several occasions that vaccines cause autism, but this is false and based on a scientific paper that was later exposed as fraudulent.
