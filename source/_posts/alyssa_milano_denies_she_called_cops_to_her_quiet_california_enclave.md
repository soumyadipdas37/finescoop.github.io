Alyssa Milano denied reports she called the police to her home Sunday and said it was her neighbor who initially called, but admitted that her talent agent husband Dave Bugliari made a follow up phone call to check on the officers' status 

Alyssa Milano has hit back at reports that she called the cops Sunday morning when an 'armed gunman' - who turned out to be a teen with an air gun - was on her property.

In a tweet Tuesday, the actress and 'defund the police' activist denied that she called the cops, and instead said it was her neighbor who made the 911 call 'after seeing a person dressed in black holding a rifle behind my home where I live with my young children and husband'. 

She did admit that her talent agent husband, Dave Bugliari, 39, made a follow up phone call to 911 to check on the status of the officers' arrival, but said they they showed up as he was on the line. 

'Rightwing media & trolls have decided that they should target me,' the actress said in her tweet after DailyMail.com published photos showing seven Ventura County Sheriffs' vehicles, one K-9 unit, a police helicopter and one Los Angeles Fire Department team guarding her home for at least three hours. 

Alyssa went on to praise the officers - who she often criticizes - and said they made her family feel 'safe and secure'. This is a very different tune for the activist who is  known to be a vocal critic of  police and supports defunding them. 

In the end, the gunman turned out to be a neighborhood teen with an air gun shooting at squirrels.

DailyMail.com obtained exclusive photos showing the first responders coming to the aid of the actress and activist who is pro defunding the police 

At least seven Ventura County Sheriffs' vehicles, one K-9 unit, a police helicopter and one Los Angeles Fire Department team sat down the street on standby, seen in DailyMail.com

The search by air and street level lasted over three hours and ended abruptly at 12.20pm

In her three-page statement, Alyssa said she and her family was getting ready to watch the Giants football game when the neighbor spotted the man, which she said 'is a rare sight in our parts'. 

Alyssa was reportedly concerned that the 'gunman' may be someone stalking the former Charmed and Who's The Boss star 

She said she and her family 'sheltered in place' until the area was secure. 

The actress went on to thank the 'brave men and women of the Ventura County Sheriffs as well as all the other officers who came to protect and serve our neighborhood. 

'These are exactly the type of situations that police officers are trained for and should be responding to, and we will always support police having the resources they need for appropriate policing actions,' she added. 

Alyssa said that she would love to see 'equally trained non-police professionals respond to addiction and mental health crises and non violent events'.  

DailyMail.com obtained exclusive photos showing the first responders coming to the aid of the 47-year-old at her five bed, six bath, 8,000 square foot, $2.5 million home in the upscale gated community of Bell Canyon that sits just 20 minutes north of Los Angeles.

A neighbor told DailyMail.com, 'We first noticed the helicopter circling overhead very low and knew something was going on, it's usually such a quiet community. Then we saw all the police cars parked in front of Alyssa's home. They had their guns at the ready and seemed very serious.'

As the morning progressed, residents received updates from law enforcement. 





In her three-page statement, Alyssa said she and her family was getting ready to watch the Giants football game when the neighbor spotted the man, which she said 'is a rare sight in our parts'

The neighbors had reported that was Alyssa and her husband who had dialed 911 when they heard what they believed to be gunshots on their 1.39-acre property.

They allegedly told the emergency hotline the sound 'scared their dogs' and made them feel like the gunman was nearby.

A description was given of a suspect to the officers who was 'male, 40-years old, with long rifle'.

The two, who have been married since 2009, were also concerned that it may be someone stalking the former Charmed and Who's The Boss star.

In 2008, Alyssa filed restraining orders against alleged stalker Jeff Turner, a then 54-year old man she claimed twice tried to break into this same home. 

The 'Nextdoor' neighborhood app was rife with concerns.

'Just drove by about 12 armed officers on Bell Canyon Road,' one resident wrote, 'They are responding to a call reporting a man with a gun in the neighborhood!! This was also the cause of the helicopter. Stay inside, stay safe!'

Alyssa's gate sat open with law enforcement guarding the entire perimeter of the street, as these DailyMail.com photos show. 

Alyssa's tweet appears to be at direct odds with the police presence on Sunday when she relied on heavy police presence to protect her

The 47-year-old lives in an 8,000 square foot, $2.5 million home in the upscale gated community that sits just 20 minutes north of Los Angeles 

At least one Los Angeles Fire Department truck was seen on the scene. Alyssa's neighbors estimate it cost thousands of tax payer dollars

The officers then had an impromptu meeting with some of the residents in the Bell Canyon community center, confirming what they dubbed, 'Squirrelgate'

The search by air and street level lasted over three hours and ended abruptly at 12.20pm.

'It turned out it was a neighborhood teen with an air gun shooting at squirrels,' a resident told the DailyMail.com.

The male teenager witnessed the emergency response and later realized he was the cause and turned himself in.

The officers then had an impromptu meeting with some of the residents in the Bell Canyon community center, confirming what they dubbed, 'Squirrelgate.'

Alyssa has owned this Bell Canyon home since 2001. She lives there with her husband and their two children, Milo, nine, and Elizabella, six. 

In July, the left leaning activist Alyssa tweeted out to her 3.7 million followers a link, urging them to sign the 'People's Budget L.A.' that demands a 90 percent reduction in police funding.

She tweeted: 'What is the Los Angeles Police Protective League? @LAPPL is a narrow special interest group that lobbies our politicians to protect the LAPD budget, pension + officers. But electeds (sic) need to #ProtectPeopleNot Police. Sign the #People'sBudgetLA petition.'

Then in August she tweeted simply, '#DefundThePolice'.  

'She uses her platform in hypocritical ways. Why not send your husband into the yard to find out what is actually going on before you call the police? I would guesstimate the response today from law enforcement cost tax payers thousands of dollars,' one neighbor said

One neighbor says, 'She can tweet those things because at the end of the day she lives behind gates in a gated community. She knows the police will come to save her. But what about all those people who don't have that luxury and live in unsafe neighborhoods? She obviously doesn't care. 

'She uses her platform in hypocritical ways. Why not send your husband into the yard to find out what is actually going on before you call the police? I would guesstimate the response today from law enforcement cost tax payers thousands of dollars.'

This isn't the first time she has been called out for being a hypocrite.

In August, ex-Charmed castmate Rose McGowan went on a twitter rant accusing her of stealing the #metoo movement.

Milano enraged McGowan when she defended presidential candidate Joe Biden after sexual assault allegations against him by a former staffer went public.

The feud prompted the hashtag #AlyssaMilanoIsALie to trend on Twitter.
