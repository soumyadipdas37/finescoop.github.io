Friday will see the next volume of Rihanna's scintillating Savage X Fenty lingerie collection.

And actress/model Cara Delevingne, along with model/DJ Soo Joo Park, served up some edgy and cheeky looks on the brand's Instagram on Wednesday, to build further buzz leading up to the Amazon Prime Video premiere of the show.

Cara, 28, and Soo Joo, 34, appeared in fishnets and lingerie in the saucy post, in a two-shot from behind that also saw the beauties rocking some artful face makeup.

The very rock 'n roll-inspired image saw the pair in pink hair – Cara's 'do surely a wig – as they were scantily clad in skimpy brassieres, thongs and silver chains. 

Cara's underthings were black with garter bands on her upper thighs, while Soo Joo's were white and paired with lacy stockings which peeked out over her fishnets and under her thigh-high boots.

Both femme fatales sported pointy white manicures, as they palmed their derrieres.  

Sublime: The images were to build further buzz leading up to the Amazon Prime Video premiere of the Savage X Fenty Volume 2 show on Friday

The ladies' makeup looks featured black linework creating a profile down the center of the face, in a similar style made famous by John Cameron Mitchell in his stage show Hedwig And The Angry Inch.

Park, a successful Korean-American DJ who is also the global ambassador Chanel and L'Oréal Paris, also wore fishnet opera gloves and a chunky chain bracelet.

'They comin' for you with that BBE*. Serve it, @caradelevingne + @soojmooj!⁣' the brand wrote in the caption for the scintillating snap, adding the footnote '* Bad Bih Energy'.

The post was sandwiched between closeups of Delevingne and Park on Savage X Fenty's Instagram feed, each 'hidden' by a 'warning' in the style of IG's trademark 'sensitive content' warnings.

One of them read: 'Shocking Content - May contain some major T&A. Clutch ya pearls, hunny.'

On the bottom, the image stated, 'See More 10.02.20'.
