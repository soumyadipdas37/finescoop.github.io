Winnie Harlow was getting into the spirit of things on Wednesday ahead of her trip to Disney World in Florida.

The model shared snaps of herself on a private jet occupying herself with a Disney colouring-in book - having flown to bubble with her boyfriend Kyle Kuzma.

The model wore a matching white sweatsuit with a pink and purple tie-dye design to it.

Now that family and close friends are allowed in the NBA's Florida-based bubble, model Winnie wasted no time flying to see her beau Kyle.

The 26-year-old Jamaican-Canadian beauty touched down at the Happiest Place on Earth on Monday after making sure last week that she was negative for the coronavirus.

Winnie and Kyle, who plays forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, have been dating since May and have been separated since the NBA restarted its 2020 season in Disney World.  

She documented her journey on social media, with the leggy beauty popping an exploding bottle of Veuve Clicquot Champagne mid-flight.

'Testing 1 2 3,' she captioned the post. 'It was easy.'

Winnie, who shot to fame on America's Next Top Model, and Kuzma appear to have fallen hard for each other in the short time they've been together.

While apart, the pair had been keeping up with one another via FaceTime.
