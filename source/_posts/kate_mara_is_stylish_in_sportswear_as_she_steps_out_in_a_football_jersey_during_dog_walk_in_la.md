She's poised to appear in new TV mini series, A Teacher, about a teacher having an affair with a younger student.

But Kate Mara's was off work mode on Sunday afternoon, as she headed out for a walk with her adorable Boston Terrier in LA.

The House of Cards star, 37, who is a 'dog mum' to two pups, Bruno and Lucius, kept her pooch close by on a leash, while she headed on her morning coffee run.

Kate wore a loose-fitting blue Reebok football jersey, marked with a giant white 10 on the front, as she made the most of her casual get-up.

She matched the casual top with a pair of comfy grey sweatpants, as she strolled along the pavement in a pair of cream trainers.

The actress and animal rights activist accessorised her look with a set of edgy clear-rimmed sunglasses and a powder blue face mask. 

Kate wore her hair in braids, as she was later seen to pick up her sweet black and white dog in both hands.

With Kate out running errands, she was without her husband Jamie Bell, 34, with whom she has spent most of the year in lockdown.

The actors welcomed their first daughter last year, but have yet to reveal her name.

Kate announced the arrival of her little girl at the end of May 2019 on social media. Alongside a sweet photo she penned: 'We had a baby a couple weeks ago... Here are her feet.'

Happy couple: Kate has been married to fellow actor Jamie Bell since 2017

The couple first met as co-stars in Fantastic Four and began dating in 2015, before getting engaged in January 2017.

Kate and Jamie married in July 2017 and now split their time between Los Angeles and New York.

While the couple's daughter is the first child for Kate, she is Jamie's second child.

The former child star shares a son, who is six, with actress ex-wife Evan Rachel Wood, 32. The couple were married from 2012 to 2014.
