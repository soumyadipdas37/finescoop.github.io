Keanu Reeves has been fully transformed into CGI for his role in the new video game Cyberpunk 2077.

The actor, 56, has provided full body motion capture, voice over, and full likeness to the game which has been eight years in the making. 

The Matrix star will play Johnny Silverhand, a rockerboy who’s anti-establishment antics will stop at nothing to steer the player and the story into carnage.

The game, due out on November 19, sees the player roam a dystopian universe where the world is obsessed with body modifications.

Players can take on Night City looking for their next big score while Keanu’s Johnny Silverhand will be key in taking their journey to the next level.

Keanu features prominently in the trailer where he walks through a dark city scape in between clips of the life-like characters featured in the game. 

In the clip, he says: 'In 2077 what makes someone a criminal? Getting caught. In Night City you can be come anyone, anything, if your body can pay the price. So seize the day and set it up with fire.'

In the game, Johnny Silverhand was the leader and frontman of SAMURAI, a chrome-rock music band and fights the inhumane practices used to take more and more of people’s personal liberties. 

It comes after Keanu had nothing but praise for coronavirus safety measures on the set of The Matrix 4, which he has been filming recently in Berlin, Germany. 

The actor said there were 'thoughtful, effective protocols in place' on set in a video chat interview with the Associated Press.

He said: 'There’s some really thoughtful, effective protocols in place, and the rhythm of filmmaking has not been really impacted or interrupted, in the sense of filming.

'That’s because of the hard work and organization, and again the thoughtfulness that has gone into the protocols.'

Filming originally began in San Francisco, where some locals were angered by property destruction caused in the midst of action scenes.

The production then moved to Berlin in February but was quickly shut down due to the pandemic.

Back in June, Keanu told Empire Magazine that it was the quality of the writing that drew him to this installment of The Matrix, which hasn't gotten a finalised title yet. '

'Lana Wachowski wrote a beautiful script and a wonderful story that resonated with me,' he said. 'That’s the only reason to do it.'

The new working relationship seemed to still have some of the old magic, even though Lana's sister Lilly Wachowski sat out this installment.

To work with her again is just amazing. It’s been really special, and the story has, I think, some meaningful things to say, and that we can take some nourishment from.'

The Matrix was originally envisioned as a science fiction–action film starring Will Smith in the Neo role, though he turned it down, and Val Kilmer as Morpheus, who was eventually played by Laurence Fishburne.

The ground-breaking film went on to be one of the most successful films of 1999 and earned four Academy Awards, along with copious praise from critics.

Two sequels, Reloaded and Revolutions, were filmed back-to-back and released close together in 2003.
