Married At First Sight star Elizabeth Sobinoff has candidly spoken about her difficult and lengthy battle with chronic illness. 

Talk to ex Big Brother Star Garth Saville on his podcast, In The Bath With Aunty Garth, the 29-year-old described her health troubles as a 'horror story', explaining that her condition was so bad she couldn't even work. 

'Before I went on Married At First Sight, I hadn't worked for over a decade. I was on a disability pension because I had a misdiagnosis and everything,' she revealed.

'It was a horror story come to life, what had happened,' she said.  

Elizabeth decided to return to returned to the workforce in 2018 after nabbing a job managing a Sydney jewellery store. 

'It was crazy that I'd just started work again,' Elizabeth explained, adding that her parents were worried about her getting a job 'after everything she'd been through.'

Just days after she stared the new job, the then-blonde was scouted by Married At First Sight producers during her lunch break and eventually scored a role on the 2019 series.  

Elsewhere in her interview, Elizabeth spoke about the controversy surrounding her recent extreme weight loss.  

'I've actually had a problem with being underweight most of my life. I have a blood condition where you need high calories,' she told Garth.

Elizabeth, who shed an estimated 10kg prior to appearing on Married At First Sight for a second time in 2020, said that she'd even been accused of being anorexic at one point in her life. 

She insisted: 'Even before I got misdiagnosed, I was severely underweight... I naturally don't carry a lot of weight.; 

'Like, I'm curvy, I've got shape to me. But I lose weight very easily,' she said.

Elizabeth previously told 9Honey that she had been diagnosed with two debilitating chronic illnesses in 2018.  

The first illness is Porphyria, a blood disorder that can affect the nervous systems and other organs, including the skin. 

The second is Autoimmune disease, a mild form of Lupus that causes her body to attack itself.
