Speaking on her Instagram Story, Vicky fumed: 'Nothing could have f******g prepared me for what just happened. 

'So we are doing some street style shooting today on location because the whole vibe of this shoot is edgy and contemporary. 

'We are showing people how they can wear [the clothes] with different styles and in different places that's not just a studio.

'Against my better judgement we're in Notting Hill because it's super pretty but I had heard rumours that these people are less than hospitable towards people taking pictures. Well nothing could have f*****g prepared me for what has just happened.'

The former Geordie Shore star explained how she popped in a coffee shop to quickly take some snaps when a woman became hostile towards her.

She continued: 'We were quick and super apologetic because we know people are just going about their daily lives. 

'Anyway, some woman starts taking the p*** out of us like pouting and posing and laughing. And I was like, I get it because I look like a bit of a c*** so I started laughing and gave her a wave.

'But then she starts giving us the finger. And I was like, 'Oh my God that's a bit intense.' And then when I laugh she spat at me! Spat at me in the middle of a global f***** pandemic.'

While Vicky may have been the victim in this case, Geordie Shore viewers will remember she once spat in the face of fellow cast member Jay Gardner in series one. 

Jay delivered some insults Vicky's way, leaving her shocked and ultimately spitting on him when the argument got out of hand with their co-stars separating them. 

Vicky expressed regret for her actions later on the show, saying: 'I am not an idiot and I am not above apologising for myself. 

'I know when I'm in the wrong. Spitting on someone does not make you big and it doesn't make you clever.'
