Jo Konta has crashed out in the third round of the US Open after losing out to Sorana Cirstea across three sets.

The British No 1, fresh from her win against fellow compatriot Heather Watson on Tuesday, once again burst out of the blocks and wrapped up the first set 6-2 after dominating across the width of the court.

But the second set proved an ultimately more testing encounter. A number of forehand errors from Konta handed the plucky world No 77 a route back in, and Cirstea duly held her nerve to level the game on the tiebreak.

Konta looked to bounce back during the decider but regularly found herself on the wrong end of some fierce backhands, leaving Cirstea to wrap up her win and bring a swift end to her opponent's Flushing Meadows dream.
