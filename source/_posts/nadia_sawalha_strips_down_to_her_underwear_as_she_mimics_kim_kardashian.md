'Saying ... Just had to send this to you two because it so perfectly sums up the old Nadia......look at the horror on your face because I was taking a photo of you!!!

'And my god she's right.'

She continued: 'I can actually remember the moment Carol took the photo . I almost wanted to cry because I thought I was so 'hideous ' a word I used all the time to describe myself back then ... look at me trying to cover my body ??

'It leaves me feeling so sad when I look back and think about how much of that holiday I wasted with 'stinking thinking ' feeling 'ugly ' comparing my figure constantly to Kaye Adams and Carol's gorgeous bodies.

'What a b****y waste of time. What a sacrilege.'
