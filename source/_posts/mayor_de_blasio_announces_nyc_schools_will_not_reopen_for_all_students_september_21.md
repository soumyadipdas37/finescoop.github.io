New York City public schools will no longer resume in-person classes for all students on Monday, September 21, as previously planned, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday. 

Instead, the city will phase students back into the classroom on a rolling basis, beginning with the youngest grades next week and ending with middle and high school students on October 1.  

The sudden change in plan has sparked even more confusion among parents already frustrated by mixed messages from de Blasio.  

This is a developing story.
