Vivica A. Fox has learned she does not have COVID-19 after receiving a false positive from a self administered test.

Following her initial results, the actress, 56, had a second test administered by a health professional and received a negative.

Fox was originally scheduled to host E!'s red carpet festivities during Sunday's Emmy Awards but had to bow out after her false positive result.

In the clear: Vivica A. Fox has learned she does not have COVID-19 after a false positive result from a 'self administered' test forced her to skip hosting E! News' red carpet show. She's seenin February above

Vivica explained in a statement shared to social media on Tuesday, saying: 'On Friday I took a self administered COVID-19 test and as many of you are aware, it came back positive.

'Two days ago I took another COVID test, this one administered by a medical professional, and I am thrilled to announce that last night my results came back NEGATIVE!' she explained.

Fox thanked everyone for their well-wishes, saying: 'I am feeling great and I want to thank everyone for their show of love and support.' 

She also stressed the importance of relying on 'medical professionals' and not DIY test in her caption.

'GM Dawlings! Got a 2nd opinion, was tested by a MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL this time. I'm THRILLED to announce my Covid-19 test results are NEGATIVE! #Lifeisgood #GodIsGood.'

Another case: Vivica's would-be co-host Giuliana Rancic also tested positive ahead of the event. She's seen in February 2020

Vivica's would-be co-host Giuliana Rancic also tested positive ahead of the event.

The red carpet veteran revealed she and her entire family had contracted COVID-19 in a statement via E! on Sunday, sharing: 'Hey, everyone. As I go into my 20th year on the E! red carpet I have to say I do not take missing an award show lightly, but unfortunately this year is just so different.'

'As part of E! and NBCUniversal's very strict testing guidelines, especially before an event like this, I did find out that I tested positive for COVID-19.'

'Now as much as I didn't want to hear that, I'm very thankful I heard it before I traveled and possibly could have exposed other people. So for that, I'm thankful.' 

Stepping in: In lieu of Vivica and Giuliana, Nina Parker and Brad Goreski ended up hosting the show

Giuliana's husband Bill Rancic - who also tested positive - appeared on The Doctors on Tuesday to give fans an update on the family's health.

'Shockingly me, Giuliana and our son Duke, we all tested positive, needless to say we were rather shocked because we were all so cautious wiping every package down,' Rancic said. 

'We got it while we were in seclusion which tells you anyone can get it ... this is not a joke.'
