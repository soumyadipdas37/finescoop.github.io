Her debut album Songs From My Heart is set to be released on October 2.

And Amanda Holden looked delighted as she held up a vinyl of her forthcoming release after presenting her Heart Breakfast show in London on Friday.

The Britain's Got Talent judge, 49, exuded elegance as she tucked in a short-sleeved black turtleneck top into an asymmetrical green pencil skirt.

Amanda's skirt featured ruched detailing and a thigh split to show off a glimpse of her slender legs as she strolled through the British capital. 

She kept her personal items in a black handbag, and kept her accessories simple as she wore a pair of chic shades.

The blonde beauty wore her golden locks in a sleek, straight style that fell over her shoulders gracefully, and she used a light palette of make-up for the outing.

Earlier in the day, Amanda fought back tears while appearing on Lorraine when she revealed her new single reminds husband Chris Hughes of their stillborn son, Theo.

The TV star debuted her the song, With You, from the musical Ghost on YouTube on Thursday and Chris said it brought back memories of losing Theo back in 2011. 



Amanda said: 'It's a song about grief and loss. It's a very moving song. My whole album means so much for me. 

'I sing it a lot. My whole album in fact is about songs that mean so much to me and my family. It was my husband Chris who absolutely floored me one day when I was singing.

'He said, "The last two lines of that song really remind me of how we felt when we lost Theo" - who was our lovely little boy who was born sleeping. The last two lines are, "you took my world away, you took my life away".'

Amanda continued: 'Chris is a typically stoic man who was very supportive of me and our girl Lexie when it all happened and never took time for himself.

'So for him to come out with that sentence, it just floored me. That's the first single we thought to release - very emotional.'
