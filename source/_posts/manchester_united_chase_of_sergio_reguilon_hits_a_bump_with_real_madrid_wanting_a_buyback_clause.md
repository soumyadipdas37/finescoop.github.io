Manchester United have hit a roadblock in their pursuit of left back Sergio Reguilon with Real Madrid reportedly insistent on a £27million buy-back clause. 

The 23-year-old made his debut for Spain over the weekend after an impressive season on loan at Sevilla, where he featured in the team which beat United last month and won the Europa League. 

Yet despite his good form, Reguilon is not in Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane's first-team plans and though United are keen on a £27m move, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the United board do not want to include a buy-back clause, according to Spanish show El Partidazo de COPE.

However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is troubled by Madrid wanting to insert a buy-back clause

The tweet details that Sevilla are not interested in permanently signing the defender, and he is behind Ferland Mendy and Marcelo in the Bernabeu pecking order at left back. 

As such, United believe a move is possible, though a buy-back clause is something they do not want to include in any such deal, as the Red Devils believe it could come to haunt them down the road. 

Madrid players such as Dani Carvajal have previously left the club, only to be bought back a few years later via a buy-back clause.  

Reguilon made his international debut on Sunday, starting in Spain's 4-0 victory against Ukraine.

He played 38 times in all competitions for Sevilla last season, as Julen Lopetegui's won the Europa League.

Yet Reguilon is not in Zinedine Zidane's first-team plans at the Bernabeu this season

The LaLiga side beat United in the semi-finals - Reguilon played the full 90 minutes in Cologne, Germany. 

Solskjaer is looking to strengthen his back-line, with Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams the current candidates for the left back spot at Old Trafford. 

Yet concerns over Shaw's injury history and fitness, as well as Williams' natural ability with his right foot, means United are keen on a fresh signing.
