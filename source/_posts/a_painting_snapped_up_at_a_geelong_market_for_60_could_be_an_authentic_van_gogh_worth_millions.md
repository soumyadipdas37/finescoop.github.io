A painting purchased for just $60 could end up being one of the most valuable pieces of art in Australia worth tens of millions of dollars. 

The piece was snapped up by an anonymous buyer at a market in Geelong, south-west of Melbourne, a few years ago and is currently being held in a vault in the Victorian capital.  

Art historians believe the painting of a windmill, with a striking resemblance to others created by Vincent Van Gogh, could be the work of the iconic artist.

Art Historian Andrew Mackenzie has been researching the artwork for two years.

He has taken it to be analysed at the National Gallery of Victoria and the work has also undergone a macro photography analysis at the Monash University.

Mr Mackenzie said early investigations indicate it could be an authentic Van Gogh painting.

'It showed up the way it was built underneath, which was very much in the style of Vincent Van Gogh,' Mr Mackenzie told Nine News. 

The dutch impressionist spent a large portion of his career painting windmills, a common fixture in the Dutch landscape.

Some of his early drawings as well as later works during his time in Paris in 1886 and 1887 feature the structures.

Mr Mackenzie believes the work may have been brought to Australia by one of Van Gogh's old art school friends Peter Russell.

'Van Gogh said "choose a couple from my studio before you go back to Australia", so it could well be that this is one of those,' he said. 

'If it is proved to be a Van Gogh, it will be probably one of the most valuable works in Australia.'
