We all celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day but what about our lovely grandparents?

They deserve some love and appreciation too.

And that's why there's Grandparent's Day, which is coming up on Sunday 4th October.

So, especially now, when things are uncertain and we can't see them as much as we want, or in the way that we want, why not send them a little something to show you care?

We've picked out a few gifts that will be sure to make them smile.

For the tech-savvy grandparent

L-R: Apple iPad (2020) 128Gb, Wi-Fi, 10.2 inch - Silver (£429) and JML Pill Oh Pad (£16.99) at Very

Lots of grandparents are very switched on and have embraced new technology like the rest of us.

And when technology can keep us in touch and allow us to properly catch up, even when we can't be together in person, it's even more crucial they have the kit to make it as simple as possible.

So that's why an easy-to-use iPad could be the solution. Video calls will be straightforward and they'll feel so much more connected to their family.

And a handy little stand will allow them to be hands free too!

For the grandparent who loves to bake

L-R: Gisela Graham Gingerbread Men Fabric Apron (£14.99) and Gisela Graham Star Press Rolling Pin (£12.99) at Very

Does your granny or grandpa have a signature bake they always make for you?

Ours made the best Victoria Sponge ever.

If your grandparent loves to bake and create delicious sweet treats, then make it even more fun for them with some new kit.

We love this gingerbread man print apron by Gisela Graham. It's so fun and festive and let's face it, Christmas is only around the corner!

And this cute and clever rolling pin has star shaped cut outs to make embossing their baked goods a breeze.

For the grandparent who loves gardening

L-R: Gardena Hand Trowel & Fork (£9.99) and Patterned Pot On Wooden Legs (£39.99) at Very

People who love gardening, LOVE gardening.

So they can never have too many tools, gadgets and ways to show off the plants they've grown. 

If your grandparent is happiest when they're out in their garden doing some weeding or planting, then give their equipment an update with this cheerful trowel and fork set.

And this attractive planter will mean they can bring some of the outside inside this winter. 

For for the grandparent who loves the outdoors

L-R: Merrell Forestbound Mid Waterpoof Boots (£120) and Regatta Ninette Waterproof Jacket (£60) at Very

Do they like long walks, hiking in the hills and a bit of a countryside ramble? 

Then they'll appreciate any gifts that make it easier (and drier) for them.

Walking boots are an absolute must for serious trekkers and these Merrell boots are sturdy and waterproof.

The reality of the British weather means things being waterproof is, of course, essential so that's why she'll be grateful for a new jacket, like this one by Regatta.

For the stylish grandparent

L-R: Monsoon Recycled Polyester Star Badge Jumper (£55) and BOSS Foxon Knitted Scarf (£65) at Very

Our granny was always so stylish and used to say 'to be well dressed, is to be suitably dressed'. Words to live by and words we've always taken to heart.

If your gran is a fashion fan too then treat her to this lovely sweater by Monsoon. The spangly stars will make her feel as special as you already know she is. 

And dapper gents will always need a smart scarf so this one by BOSS is ideal for keeping him warm and looking his best.

Personalised gifts just for them

L-R: Me To You Personalised Me To You Grandad Mug (£9.99) and Personalised Nan I Love You A Whole Bunch Hanging Slate (£12.99) at Very

Everyone loves a personalised gift and that includes our grandparents.

We guarantee this personalised mug will become his favourite for all his cups of tea. 

And every time your nan sees this sweet, heart decoration she'll be reminded how much you love her.
