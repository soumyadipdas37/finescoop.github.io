The power couple's marriage, however, recently sparked headlines and it was reported she is 'exhausted' by the stress of dealing with her husband's bipolar episodes, according to People.  

The strain on their relationship was put in the public eye after his recent political campaign rally and Twitter meltdown, where he discussed how he and wife Kim Kardashian once considered having an abortion when she was pregnant with North, and hinted that she once had an affair with rapper Meek Mills. 

Kanye has since apologized and the pair traveled to the Dominican Republic on a private family vacation, just weeks before she announced the end of her family's reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians.
