A mother-of-two has been shot dead in what police believe was a murder-suicide by her husband who then turned the gun on himself. 

Mikki Starr, 27, was found dead at her home in Lima, Ohio, on Wednesday afternoon by police alongside the body of husband Zachary, 29.

Officers were called after family members noticed that Zachary had posted some 'alarming' messages on social media.

A preliminary investigation concluded that Zachary had killed Mikki before turning the weapon on himself. 

Detective Sergeant Jason Garlock, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We had information from family members that there were some social media messages that gave us the indication that’s what we’re probably looking at right now.'

Mikki had graduated from Elida High School in 2012 and then from Rhodes State College in 2019.

She had owned the house on Ford Avenue since March 2017. The young mother had been an endoscopy technician at Mercy Health-St. Rita’s Medical Center since August 2019. 

She and Zachary first met in May 2012 and they married on June 24, 2017.

They had a son, Ryker Starr, in July 2013 and a daughter Ryah Starr, in March 2019. 

They also had a stillborn child, Greyson Starr, in July 2016.

Tributes have been paid to Mikki on the Facebook page of her cousin - Tracey Anne Davis.

Ms Davis wrote 'This is heartbreaking I cannot believe this.

'My heart is breaking. This is my cousin Mikki Starr and I am asking for everyone to keep my family in your prayers TIA my poor auntie.'

Jessica Lynn Davis added 'So sorry my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family during this difficult time.

While Jennifer Neal said 'Such a tragedy. Praying for you and your family.'

Mikki's death is the seventh homicide from a shooting or a stabbing investigated this year in Lima.

There was ten murders in the city in the whole of last year, which was a ten year high.

Both bodies were sent to the Lucas County Coroner’s Office for autopsies.

Mikki's funeral is on Wednesday from 1pm at Chiles-Laman Funeral & Cremation Services, Shawnee Chapel. The burial will follow at Pike Run Cemetery.
