Bethenny Frankel has been public about her devotion to health and wellness, whether its showing off her toned physique on social media or promoting products from her Skinnygirl empire.

And the 49-year-old Real Housewives of New York City alum revealed on Sunday that, at the request of her 10-year-old daughter Bryn, she is overhauling her eating habits and returning to a vegetarian diet.

'Bryn wants to be a vegetarian cause she loves animals, so she's asked me to do it with her,' explained Frankel, who shared images of some of the ethical dishes she whipped up to her Instagram Story.

She added: 'I used to eat this way, so let's see how it goes.' 

A vegetarian diet is completely free of meat consumption and, often times, the consumption of by-products resulting from animal slaughter.

One of the meat-free entrees Bethenny prepared on Sunday was a delicious looking cauliflower crust pizza with 'vegan mozzarella [she] shredded and marinara.'

The successful entrepreneur noted that 'the key' to making the cauliflower crust as delectable as possible is by '[using] a pizza stone and crisp[ing] both sides of crust on high heat before adding toppings.'

She followed up her pizza post with images of some pan-roasted 'vegan fish filets,' a serving of herby potatoes, and a refreshing romaine lettuce, tomato, and baby corn salad.

Frankel added a line to her post that urged her 2.2million followers to 'Use what [they] have' at their disposal to make plant-based dishes of their own. 

Removing meat, including seafood, may prove beneficial for Bethenny, being that she suffers from a 'rare fish allergy.'

Back in 2018, the reality star's allergy became public knowledge, when she experienced a near fatal reaction after consuming a bowl of fish soup at a restaurant.

'I had soup, itched & was unconscious for 15 mins then to ER & ICU for 2 days with BP (blood pressure) of 60/40,' revealed Bethenny on Twitter at the time. 

She added: '911 & EPI save me. I’ll never not carry an #epipen @NewtonWellseley.'

Bethenny shares 10-year-old daughter Bryn with ex husband and businessman Jason Hoppy, 49. The pair originally wed in 2010.

Frankel has been quarantining with Bryn and her film producer boyfriend Paul Bernon at all three of her properties in Manhattan, the Hamptons, and their newly acquired home in Boston.

Unfiltered: On Monday, the Skinnygirl CEO uploaded an unfiltered selfie to her Instagram page as she ran errands around the city

On Monday, the Skinnygirl CEO uploaded an unfiltered selfie to her Instagram page as she ran errands around the city. 

She stressed the importance of posting more unfiltered and 'realistic' images of women on social media. 

'The more I see photos on social media that are filtered, contoured, eyelashed, extensioned, & retouched - the more important it is to post #nofilter, real, everyday photos. I want to show our daughters (and sons) a realistic female image. #THISiswhatilooklike #thisisme #unfilteredselfie #noglam #workingmom,' wrote Frankel.
