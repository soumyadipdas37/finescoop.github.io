On Father's Day, she and Red Wiggle husband Simon Pryce announced that they're expecting their first child together. 

And on Tuesday, Lauren Hannaford showed off her burgeoning baby bump. 

The 33-year-old fitness buff shared a sweet picture of herself cradling her belly as she thanked fans for well wishes after their pregnancy announcement.   

'We can't wait to meet bub!' Lauren Hannaford showed off her burgeoning baby bump on Tuesday, after announcing she and Red Wiggle husband Simon Pryce are expecting their first child together

'Thanks so much to everyone who has said congratulations to Si and me over the past couple of days, we are so excited and can't wait to meet bub!!' Lauren captioned the post. 

She added that she's been keeping active while pregnant by doing 15-minute workouts from her own FHIT program. 

'But of course make sure you check with your doctor first if you are pregnant,' Lauren said.

Lauren and Red Wiggle Simon, 48, announced on Sunday, which was Father's Day, that they're expecting their first child together.

Alongside two photos where the performer cuddles up to his already heavily pregnant wife of three years, they revealed the baby is due next year.

Simon captioned the photos: 'Lauren and I are beyond excited and overjoyed to be expecting our first baby in early 2021.'

'I already feel like I'm bursting with love. I think Lauren will be happy when it's born so I stop talking to her stomach, especially when we are in the supermarket aisle.'

He concluded by adding: 'Happy Father's Day to me. Well not quite yet but soon. #BabyPryce #2021'. 

It's good news for the pair, who last year announced plans to start trying for a baby.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Lauren said the couple have been 'talking about it forever' but their busy schedules have made it impossible.

'We would love to have a family [but] it's just a matter of being in the same place at the right time for that to happen,' she told the publication.
