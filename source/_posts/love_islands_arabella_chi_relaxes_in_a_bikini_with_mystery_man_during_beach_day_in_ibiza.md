She's been spotted packed on the PDA with a mystery new man in Ibiza, over the past week.

And, Arabella Chi was at it again on Monday, as she enjoyed another sun-soaked beach day with her new love, just weeks after going public with Josh Newsham and four months after splitting from Wes Nelson.

The Love Island star, 29, showcased her model physique in a soft pink, velvet-look bikini, and flashed a smile as she was seen relaxing on a sunlounger with her male companion.

The reality TV star's two-piece featured a barely-there triangle bikini top and matching briefs to further accentuate her slender pins and toned waist. 

Arabella also sported a selection of chunky bracelets, necklaces and rings, and later wrapped up in a white crochet kaftan.

Her companion, meanwhile, sported a white open shirt and pair of blue and grey patterned shorts, and covered up with a camouflage print cap and a pair of shades. 

MailOnline has previously contacted Arabella Chi's representatives for further comment.

Her new romance may come as a surprise to fans, as things appeared to be hotting up with Josh just a few weeks ago.  

The blonde moved in with fellow Love Island alum Harley Brash, 21, in June following her split from Wes, 22.  

The pair had been dating for nine months but were said to have 'grown apart' and had become more aware of their six-year age gap ahead of their break-up. 

Design engineer Wes moved out of their home so they didn't have to isolate together under lockdown rules.

The Dancing On Ice hunk is now living with pal and former Love Island star, Josh Denzel. 

A source told The Sun at the time: 'It's all over. They started to grow apart. They want to remain civil with each other and hope to remain friends.'  

The news likely came as a shock to their fans, as just a week before they called it quits, the pair revealed that they were enjoying their time in lockdown together.

Speaking to OK! Online, Wes said: 'It's been alright. It's hard to get out at the moment, isn't it? We're just trying to do our piece of exercise a day.

'We spend a lot of time with each other anyway so it's been okay to self-isolate because it's pretty much what we have been doing anyway, it's the same as before but we're just not getting out and about.

The exes had moved into their first flat together back in December, gushing that they were ready to start 'the next chapter' of their life.

In 2018, the Staffordshire native reached the final of Love Island with former exotic dancer Megan Barton-Hanson, before ending their relationship in January 2019.

Arabella then appeared on the 2019 series of the ITV2 show and struck up a brief romance with Danny Williams, but was dumped from the island after just seven days.
