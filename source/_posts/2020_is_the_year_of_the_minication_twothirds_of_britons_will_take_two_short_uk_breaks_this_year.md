Two-thirds of Britons will take two short UK breaks this year, with York, Cornwall and the Lake District among the favourite destinations of 2020.

A new survey suggests that over a quarter (26 per cent) of people do not feel confident taking a long holiday this year amid coronavirus fears.

Nearly half said they would feel 'safer' if they took lots of short domestic breaks during the pandemic instead of heading overseas.

A third of Britons said that taking lots of short breaks was also more cost effective and 'better for their wellbeing' than one long holiday.

And 42 per cent of those surveyed said they will visit multiple destinations during their short breaks, combining coastal breaks with rural or city trips.

The UK's top minication coastal destinations are Cornwall, Devon, North Wales and Whitby, the survey by Travelodge found. York, Edinburgh and London are the most popular cities, while Britons enjoy flocking to the Lake District and the Cotswolds for country fun

The UK's top coastal destinations for a 2020 'minication' are Cornwall, Devon, North Wales, Whitby and the Isle of Wight, the survey by Travelodge found.

York, Edinburgh and London are the most popular city destinations, while Britons most enjoy flocking to the Lake District and the Cotswolds for country fun.  

It comes as data released by online bank Marcus by Goldman Sachs found that Britons have adopted thrifty spending habits during lockdown, with one third of adults polled saying they planned on eating out less in restaurants going forward.

 'Our study reveals that we have become a mighty Minication Nation and we are rediscovering what makes Britain so great,' a Travelodge spokeswoman said.

'Our 575 UK hotels are now all open and with our Covid-19 safety measures in place, we are welcoming customers from all corners of the UK. 

'We are also seeing a growing trend in more Britons taking multi-location short breaks with a combination of a coastal, rural or city break.

'Taking regular short breaks helps to maximise your holiday time, reboot your batteries, discover the beauty of Blighty and it also provides interesting content to share on your social news feeds.'

The survey also suggests that nearly a third (32 per cent) of Britons are booking lots of short breaks in the UK so they can use up their holiday entitlement. 

Over a fifth polled said that spontaneous short breaks help them to copy and feel in control as the coronavirus pandemic leads to increased levels of stress.

Meanwhile, people from Chelmsford, Oxford and Norwich reportedly spend the most money per minication, at £374, £320 and £316 respectively.

They take more short breaks to Cornwall and Devon, the poll found, while people from Liverpool spend the least at £289 per minication. 

Earlier today MailOnline reported that one in five Britons have slashed spending on takeaways while 25 per cent of people surveyed have said they will carry on doing more home-cooking going forward.

New data published by online bank Marcus by Goldman Sachs are a blow to the Government's efforts to kickstart the UK economy after being effectively mothballed during the pandemic. 

They also show that it will take more than Chancellor Rishi Sunak's hugely popular Eat Out to Help Out scheme to revive Britain's hospitality sector. 

Meanwhile, 12 per cent polled said they will not return to indoor gyms, having bought home equipment and paid for online fitness subscriptions.

Eleven per cent claim they will not go back to beauty salons, while 25 per cent of all surveyed are choosing not to spend as much on clothes in future.

And 18 per cent admit they will not go on holidays abroad as regularly as they were pre-coronavirus in light of the Government's quarantine list.  

Of those who have managed to save more money than usual during lockdown, 29 per cent said they have put away around £340 more than they normally would.
