He made his name as detective Sam Tyler in Life On Mars.

John takes on the lead role of detective Roy Grace, and was seen filming alongside fellow actor Richie Campbell who portrays his partner DS Glenn Branson. 

The Doctor Who star and Richie filmed outside in the seaside town, and they adopted tense expressions as they went through the scene. 

Richie also put on a dapper display in a dark blue plaid three piece suit, and he completed the outfit by wearing a white shirt and a striped tie.

Writer Russell Lewis, who has also worked on Morse and Lewis, said: 'I’m thrilled and honoured to be involved in bringing Peter James’ brilliantly gripping series of Roy Grace novels to ITV. 

'Each story is a fantastic, hair-raising, twisting, switch-back of a roller-coaster ride that grips the reader from first to last, and the opportunity to translate that best-selling magic to television is like all one’s Christmases and birthdays come at once.'

He added: 'That John Simm will be breathing flesh to the bones of Roy Grace really is the cherry on a dark, and troublingly encrimsoned cake…'

While author Peter James was also delighted with John's casting, as he claimed in a statement that John 'actually looks like the Roy Grace of my imagination.'

He added: 'With John in the lead, the brilliant scripting by Russell Lewis, and our wonderful production team, I’m confident that fans of my novels and of TV crime dramas in general will be in for a treat.'

A release date has yet to be announced for the programme, but it is set to air on ITV.
