Many celebrities have volunteered to strip down for Seven's Full Monty over the years to raise awareness for men’s and women’s cancers.

And on Sunday, Todd McKenney rated which male stars were better than others when it came to learning the art of stripping for the TV program. 

Speaking to news.com.au, the 55-year-old admitted that there were a handful stars he was least impressed with during his time choreographing The All New Monty.

Best known for his musical talents and as a judge on Australia's Dancing With The Stars, Todd said breakfast TV weatherman Sam Mac was the 'dodgiest stripper'.

'In terms of enthusiasm he was one of the best, but in terms of raw stripping dance ability… let's just say he got there,' he said.

Todd explained that AFL star Wayne Carey, who is set to bare all this week, also struggled.

'For a footballer who knows how to move so well on the field, he’s a bit of a fish out of water on the dance floor,' McKenney explained.

When asked who was the most talented star to appear on the show, the Australian entertainer named former Bachelor star Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson.

This year, eight men and seven women are part of the current season, with the male stars set to strip down on Sunday night's show. 

The male performers this year will include former Home and Away star Orpheus Pledger, Samuel Johnson, TV presenter Adam Dovile and model Tom Derickx.

The performance was filmed in front of a crowd at the Enmore theater in Sydney.
