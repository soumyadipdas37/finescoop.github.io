A coronavirus survival calculator that could 'save countless lives' by predicting a hospital patient's risk of death from the disease has been developed by doctors. 

The simple checklist - which takes ten seconds to complete and can be done on the back of an envelope - uses details including sex, age and breathing rate to score patients from 0 to 21 as they arrive at the hospital door.

This means those at greater risk could be rushed for early treatment in intensive care, increasing their chances of survival, while those thought to be at low risk could be discharged for community care - freeing up much-needed beds in hospitals.

The calculator, revealed today in the British Medical Journal, was developed after five months of research involving more than 57,000 coronavirus patients at UK hospitals. 

Experts said it should be deployed in hospitals immediately so they are prepared in the event of a second wave.

There have been 12 more deaths of Covid-19 in the UK, as of 4pm on Wednesday

The calculator works by dividing patients into four groups - 'low risk', 'medium risk', 'high risk' or 'very high risk'.

Patients that score less than three are at 'low risk' according to the model, with a less than one per cent chance of death.

But those scoring nine or more were marked at high risk, with a 50 per cent chance of death, and those above 15 were predicted to have a 62 per cent chance of death.

The scoring system, dubbed the 'coronavirus survival calculator' uses eight different pieces of information. These are:

To develop the calculator, medics monitored 35,463 coronavirus patients at 260 hospitals in England, Scotland and Wales between February and May this year to determine which factors were best for predicting risk of death. 

After determining what factors were best predictors of risk of death, it was then checked against a further 22,361 patients taken to the same hospitals between May and June.

The medics found that it both worked effectively and made more accurate predictions than the 15 models currently used to predict a patients' risk of death. 

Patients included in the study had an average age of 74 years.

Senior author of the study, Professor Ewen Harrison from Edinburgh University, said the 'easy-to-use' tool would lead to better treatment.

'As doctors, we want to identify groups of patients most at risk of dying from Covid-19,' he said. 'If we can do that at the front door of the hospital, then treatment can be better planned.

'This easy-to-use tool will help doctors make decisions to provide patients with the optimal care.'

Paper author Dr Antonia Ho, from the University of Glasgow, said: 'This simple tool will help doctors at the front door to make informed decisions on how to manage patients with Covid-19.

'On the one hand, it will allow targeting of early treatment and admission to critical care in patients at high risk of dying, and conversely, identifying low-risk patients that may be safely managed at home.'

The Minister for Innovation, Lord James Bethell, heralded the calculator as 'really valuable research'. 

'Protecting the most vulnerable from Covid-19 is a priority which is why we're supporting valuable research like this to help doctors make the best possible decisions for NHS patients,' he said.

'I am delighted to see my former university leading the way on it. 

'We look forward to seeing how this new tool can help clinicians target treatments more effectively for coronavirus patients admitted to hospital now and in the future, potentially saving countless lives.'

The report comes after research warned earlier this week that if coronavirus surges in the UK over winter, an astonishing 87 per cent of NHS trusts could be overwhelmed.

The analysis calculated the normal bed occupancy rate during winter, and added this to the rate of hospitalisations due to the coronavirus in May.

This did not take into account NHS Nightingale hospitals or extra capacity from private hospitals due to a lack of data.

The tool was designed by the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium involving researchers from Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and Imperial College London. 

It was funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and by the Department of Health and Social Care.
