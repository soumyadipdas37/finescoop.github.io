Gemma White might not have won Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor, but the beauty was certainly showing him what he's missing on Monday. 

Posing on the balcony of her Gold Coast hotel, the 28-year-old looked sensational in a tiny yellow bikini. 

Showing off her incredible figure, Gemma threw her hair back as she leaned on the railing in a photo shared to Instagram. 

Wow! Gemma White might not have won Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor, but the beauty was certainly showing him what he's missing on Monday. Posing on the balcony of her Gold Coast hotel in this Instagram image, the 28-year-old looked sensational in a tiny yellow bikini

Wearing a nude makeup palette and her blonde hair down and straight around her shoulders, the stunner went barefoot and looked as relaxed as can be. 

She explained in her caption that the photo was taken on the weekend, writing: 'Can we please rewind and pause. #weekendthings #takemeback'. 

Despite her good looks, Gemma has admitted she struggled with bullying and self-esteem issues as a teenager.

In a resurfaced interview with the Courier Mail from 2017, she revealed how childhood bullying led her to embark on a weight loss journey at 15.

'I was 26kg heavier than I am now. There's nothing wrong with being bigger or smaller, but it's a matter of being happy,' she said.  

'I was huge compared to everyone else in my year and I was bullied for that, and the fact is that one in three children are bullied.'

The blonde shed the pounds over two years and eventually joined a modelling school at 17.

However, her slimmed-down physique attracted more bullying, with many people questioning just how she'd managed to drop the kilos.

'I then copped bullying on the other side with people saying, "Oh, she must be bulimic," but I was able to overcome that,' Gemma revealed.

She went on to be crowned Miss Australia Continents in 2018.

Gemma now works as a real estate agent on the Gold Coast.
