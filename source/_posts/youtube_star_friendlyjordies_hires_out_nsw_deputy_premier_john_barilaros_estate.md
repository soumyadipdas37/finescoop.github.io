YouTube star Friendlyjordies has claimed he had sex in a luxury estate owned by NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro after renting out the property on AirBnb.

The Youtuber, whose real name is Jordan Shanks, on Monday followed up on attacks he made on Mr Barilaro and Premier Gladys Berejiklian earlier this year where he accused the pair of being 'koala killers'.

In one skit Shanks used an exaggerated Italian accent in a cartoon showing Mr Barilaro and Ms Berjiklian as Nintendo video game characters Mario and Luigi jumping on koalas and killing them.   

This sparked an angry response from Mr Barilaro who said the video was 'racist' and 'very offensive'. 

Shanks's latest video comes after Mr Barilaro clashed with the premier over a koala protection policy the Nationals leader said would strip farmers of their land rights. 

The YouTuber revealed on Monday he'd spent the weekend renting out the large estate co-owned by the deputy premier in Oallen, around 220km south-west of Sydney.

In a 26-minute long video, Shanks told his 445,000 followers he had sex in both of the property's guest houses.

'As you've probably gathered, or haven't because you're that dumb, I'm filming at your estate,' Shanks told Mr Barilaro in the video.

'And I want you to be the first to know that I f***ed in both your guest houses. 

Shanks said he received permission to film in the house for a birthday party. 

Throughout the video, Shanks referred to the premier as 'bruz' and took aim at his handling of the recent koala-saving program and claimed he was pork barrelling.

He also criticised Mr Barilaro for holidaying in London while NSW was experiencing one of its worst bushfire seasons on record.

Mr Barilaro had said the New Year's Eve fireworks display should be cancelled while the fires continued to burn across the state but that idea was dismissed when Ms Berejiklian announced a day later they would go on. 

In the video Shanks also labelled Mr Barilaro 'fat lips', an 'idiot' and a 'ball of grease' and wore a t-shirt of a cartoon version of the premier stomping on a koala with the phrase 'Super Barilaro bruz' - in reference to the Super Mario character.  

Shanks then took his viewers on a tour of Mr Barilaro's house, pointing out the estate's butler's pantry, pool, private lake and two guest houses.

The seven-bedroom estate is advertised on Airbnb for $1,850 a night and also features a tennis court.

Shanks labelled Mr Barilaro a 'koala killer' after a debate surrounding a policy that would protect the habitat of the vulnerable species.

The Koala Habitat Protection State Environment Planning Policy identified 123 trees that were needed as food or shelter for the animals.

Mr Barilaro said the policy would be taking away land from farmers. 

'If we were to support that we would become the laughing stock of regional and rural NSW,' he said.

'This is the right thing to fight for on behalf of the community.' 

Nationals MPs then threatened to stop supporting government legislation to which Ms Berejiklian said they could either sit on the crossbench or remain in the government.

 Mr Barilaro then backflipped on Friday and told the Premier the Nationals would support the legislation after it was agreed the policy would be discussed in a future cabinet meeting.

He said it was a 'a win for the regions, a win for farmers'. 

Opposition Leader Jodi McKay said Ms Berejiklian should have 'pulled him into line earlier'.

'This is a capitulation that no-one expected,' she said. 

'He's taken the Government to the brink and his position is now completely untenable.'

After the stoush, Shanks shared a series of videos of him visiting koalas and tweeted: 'When Gladys Berejiklian accepts John Barilaro's Nationals back into the coalition she will be the most compromised premier in Australian history.' 

He also claimed credit for bringing the NSW Coalition Government to the verge of collapse. 

The YouTuber said he rented out the estate on Airbnb which has two guest houses for $1,850 a night

Shanks also noted Mr Barilaro had urged residents to stay home during the peak of COVID-19 only to visit his estate where he said he was building a cubby house with his daughter - along with feeding the chickens and mowing the lawn.

'It was a decision I made on the weekend,' he said in May.

'I had the opportunity at the weekend down on the farm to build a cubby house with my four-year-old. I had the opportunity to be fun and silly.'  

Mr Barilaro in June condemned Shanks' previous videos, where the YouTuber highlighted the deputy premier's Italian heritage, impersonated him using a thick Italian accent and said his birth name was Giovanni. 

'I don't mind taking the mickey out of myself, but this is actually very offensive. It's a low attempt at comedy and full of racist undertones,' Mr Barilaro told The Daily Telegraph.

'To imitate both myself and the Premier with such obvious distaste for our backgrounds is unacceptable.

'Our migrant story is actually the Australian success story, one this nation is proud of.'

The deputy premier was born to Italian migrants who came to Australia in 1968. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Barilaro for comment. 

Shanks even claimed he had sex in two of Mr Barilaro's guest homes on the estate and labelled him an 'idiot' and a 'ball of grease'
