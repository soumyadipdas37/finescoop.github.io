Police have been told the man approached a woman - who is seven months pregnant - and deliberately barged into her, knocking her into a fence.

A 46-year-old man was arrested and taken to Wollongong Hospital for assessment, before being taken to Wollongong Police Station, where he was charged with common assault.

The man was refused bail and will appear in Wollongong Local Court on Wednesday.
