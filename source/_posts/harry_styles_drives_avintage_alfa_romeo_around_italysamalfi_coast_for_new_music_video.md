He's been forced to postpone his anticipated tour once again.

But Harry Styles is still keeping busy, filming on Italy's stunning Amalfi Coast this week for his new music video. 

The One Direction star looked every inch the James Bond as he got behind the wheel of a vintage Alfa Romeo to shoot scenes for the video to accompany another song release from his solo album Fine Line.

In a video filmed by @microba96 and shared on Twitter on Wednesday, the heartthrob was seen speeding around the coast roads in the stunning location.

Another car rigged with cameras was in front, capturing Harry as he confidently drove around.

Other scenes shot this week include Harry driving a speedboat off the coast, looking dapper in a striped white shirt. 

Harry's return to work comes after he made the decision this month to postpone another leg of  his 2020 Love On Tour shows.

The singer, 26, took to Twitter last week to announce that all of his shows would be delayed 'until further notice' amid the COVID-19 pandemic which has swept the globe.

Harry also shared his 'hope' to play his scheduled 2021 dates, as he insisted that 'everyone's health and safety remains top priority'. 

Harry tweeted: 'Everyone's health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone all 2020 shows in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand until further notice.

'I really hope to play the shows as planned for 2021 but will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks and months.

'I can't wait to see you all on the road as soon as it's safe to do so.'

The announcement comes three months after Harry postponed the North America leg of his concert tour.

In June, the hitmaker was forced to reschedule the Love On Tour shows until next summer, with the run set to kick off on August 14 and wrap on October 31, 2021, due to the 'ongoing threat from Covid-19'.

During his time off the road, the singer has vowed to use his time to 'listen and educate' himself on 'how' he can 'help more in the fight for justice and equal rights', following the death of George Floyd and the global Black Lives Matter protests.

In a powerful statement shared to his social media at the time, Harry wrote: 'This summer we were excited to be bringing Love On Tour to North America.

'I can't wait to see you all out on the road, as soon as it's safe to do so. 'We are in a moment of necessary change and growth in the world. 

'I will be using this time to listen, and to educate myself on how I can help more in the fight for justice and equal rights for all in the future.

'I hope that you will take the time to do the same. Treat people with kindness.'
