The Bachelor's Roxi Kenny dramatically exited the show after a fiery stoush with co-star Juliette Herrera on Thursday night. 

The 29-year-old blonde reached boiling point after the two women got into an argument at the cocktail party.

After weeks of feuding, Roxi walked into another room following an argument with Juliette - with a producer telling her to calm down.
