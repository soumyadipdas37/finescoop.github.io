Love Island star Molly Smith took to Instagram to hit back at bodyshamers who called her 'too skinny'. 

Insisting that her toned body is down to her personal trainer, she insisted that she has never eaten as much as she does at the moment. 

Molly, 26, shared a couple of pictures of her body on social media alongside her post which was entitled: 'Body shaming.'

'Telling someone they’re too skinny isn’t OK': Love Island's Molly Smith hit back at bodyshamers on Instagram after sharing lingerie snaps and reading the comments 

She penned: 'I’ve had a few comments about being "too skinny" ... that I need to eat more etc ... I’ve actually never been so healthy.

'Telling someone they’re too skinny isn’t OK, no one knows the background of that person.'

She continued: 'I work hard at the gym and enjoy my workouts and PT’s with @zakmason__ (even though I annoy him) and I’m so appreciative of how hard he pushes me and helps me.

Comparisons: She also shared a couple of pictures of her strong and toned body after working with a personal trainer



Her words: Molly quite rightly said that people should think twice before commenting on her appearance and insisted she has never eaten more than she does right now

'Also @francisdiet has helped me to understand food and maintain a healthier lifestyle - I’ve actually never eaten so much.' 

Molly's post came after she shared a picture of herself wearing orange lace lingerie from inside her home. 

Clearly having read some of the comments, of which many were also positive Molly, she decided to address some of the things she had read. 

She is currently living with fellow Love Island contestant Callum Smith in Manchester and they appear to be very loved up.

They recently went on a holiday to Greece where Molly shared lots of stunning bikini snaps on social media.   

The latest series of Love Island was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic and will not return again until next summer when it is hoped restrictions will have eased.

To recover from the drought of a Love Island-less summer, ITV2 have been airing the Australian version of the hit series, and the USA rendition hit the small screen on September 7.

All change: The latest series of Love Island was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic and will not return again until next summer when it is hoped restrictions will have eased.
