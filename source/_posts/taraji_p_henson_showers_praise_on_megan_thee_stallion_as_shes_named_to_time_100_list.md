For the first time ever, the Time 100 Most Influential People In the World list was unveiled as part of an ABC TV special, one of whom was Megan Thee Stallion.

The publication traditionally pairs each person on the list with a famous fan or friend, with the 25-year-old rapper (real name Megan Jovon Ruth Pete) paired with Taraji P. Henson, who had nothing but praise for the Hot Girl Summer singer.

While Henson wrote a brief piece for Time, she also spoke on video on why the rapper deserves a place among the most influential people in the world.

Taraji speaks: While Henson wrote a brief piece for Time , she also spoke on video on why the rapper deserves a place among the most influential people in the world.

'I don't like to put the stigma of the word "Strong" on Black women because I think it dehumanizes us. But Megan -- she's got a strength. She is the epitome of tenacity,' Henson began. 

'She was shot this summer and still people tried to tear her down,' Henson said, referring to an incident in July where rapper Tory Lanez shot her after an argument in an SUV.

'It's just invigorating to see her become a platinum-selling artist with multiple number-one songs, but she's got a plan that's much bigger,' Henson added.

Strength: 'I don't like to put the stigma of the word "Strong" on Black women because I think it dehumanizes us. But Megan -- she's got a strength. She is the epitome of tenacity,' Henson began

Plan: 'It's just invigorating to see her become a platinum-selling artist with multiple number-one songs, but she's got a plan that's much bigger,' Henson added

'And I just want her to keep winning. I love you, meg,' Henson conclude

The Stallion herself added, 'I'm, like, a girl's girl. And I love to support women. When I was younger, I only hung around my grandma, my aunt, and my mom.'

She added that she didn't 'hang around a lot of kids,' and that, 'for the first eight years of my life, my dad was in jail.'

Girl's girl: The Stallion herself added, 'I'm, like, a girl's girl. And I love to support women. When I was younger, I only hung around my grandma, my aunt, and my mom'

The rapper also praised her mother, adding, 'We weren't rich, but my mom made me feel like we were rich.

'Like, she took care of me, and my grandmother helped and my great-grandmother helped and they were working these regular jobs and they were just trying the best they could to just make me feel like I was a princess,' she added.

She also added how surprised she was about the 'uproar' over her hit song Wap with Cardi B. 

Praise mom: The rapper also praised her mother, adding, 'We weren't rich, but my mom made me feel like we were rich.

'When I saw all of the politicians in an uproar about mine and Cardi's "Wap", you know, I was just really taken back,' she said with a laugh.

'Like, why is this your focus right now? If you have an issue with what I'm saying', don't listen to it. Tune out, 'cause I didn't ask you to tune in,' she added.

She concluded her interview but saying she loves how, 'we have so many women in music  right now, so, like, I just feel like it's better to work together because we could really just take over all of this.'

Other entertainers on the Time 100 list who were featured on the ABC special included Michael B. Jordan, who spoke about being inspired by the younger generation.

'You know, for me, this generation inspires me. You know, they're strong. You know, they have more potential than I do,' he added.

'Even with the pandemic and things that are a little bit out of our control, they're still finding ways to connect and come together as one. And I think that's a beautiful thing to see,' he added.

While she's still a kid herself, 17-year-old Jojo Siwa added she's also inspired by kids around her.

'What inspires me the most is the good humans in the world. You know, the people who love everybody, who support everybody, and who really accept everyone for who they are. And of course, the kids of today,' she said.

'They inspire me to keep doing what I'm doing and to keep having fun and to keep being a kid,' Siwa added.

Gabrielle Union and Dwayne Wade were named to the Time 100 for setting an example for parents and allowing their kids to live their true selves. 

'We have a daughter that is almost two, that the world has seen is bound to nothing but whatever is in her heart and on her soul at the moment,' Union said. 

'We have another daughter who's 13, who has the freedom to be exactly who she is, who she was born to be, to be her most authentic self. She doesn't ask permission to exist. That is wildly inspiring,' she said of their daughter Zaya, who came out as transgender. 

Wade added, 'To echo my wife, we're inspired by our kids. The way they look at us, the way they look to us for leadership, for guidance, for that moment of bravery.'
