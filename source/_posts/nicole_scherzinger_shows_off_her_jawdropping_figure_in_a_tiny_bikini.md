They may have been dating for less than a year, but Nicole and Thom are clearly devoted to one another and divide their time between her LA pad and London.

According to reports, Nicole is trying for a baby with her former rugby player beau.

The singer is said to be keen to start a family of her own with Thom, as the couple are looking to the future and intend on purchasing a property together in London.

A friend told The Sun: 'Thom told pals he's been taking supplements to boost fertility. Nicole and Thom are ridiculously loved-up, and have had serious conversations about everything from marriage to babies.

'No one would be surprised if they had some baby news in the coming months.

'Thom currently lives with his brother and a housemate in London which hardly makes for a romantic love nest. They are looking to buy a house together once lockdown is over.'

Nicole's representatives declined to comment and MailOnline also contacted Thom's representatives who are yet to comment.
