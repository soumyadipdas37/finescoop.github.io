Geordie Shore star Chloe Ferry enjoyed a very boozy night out in London on Sunday night, despite not even filming for the sure. 

The reality star, 25, struggled to contain her assets in a form-fitting rust coloured mini dress and was pictured grappling with her assets as her night came to a close. 

Having partied up a storm at London's Tree House Hotel, Chloe appeared bleary-eyed as she headed home, pausing to sit down in the road.
