Silvio Berlusconi announced he had gotten 'away with it' again as he left hospital today after being admitted with coronavirus.

The 83-year-old former Italian premier tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a holiday at his luxury villa in Sardinia.

He was admitted to the San Raffaele hospital in Milan on September 3 with a lung infection and left today, 11 days after.

'Once again, I seem to have got away with it,' he told journalists as he left the hospital, after walking slowly but without assistance.

'It was tough. Thank heavens, thanks to the doctors, I got over what was perhaps the most difficult ordeal of my life. 

'The first three days were extremely difficult.'

Two of his children, daughter Barbara, 36, and son Luigi, 31, also contracted the virus, as did his companion Marta Fascina.

A former crooner turned property and media magnate, Berlusconi was Italian prime minister for his centre-right Forza Italia on three occasions between 1994 and 2011.

Despite his regular brushes with the law and health concerns, including open heart surgery in 2016, the man known as 'the immortal' for his longevity in politics led the Italian right for more than two decades.

Berlusconi is no stranger to controversy,  infamous for his 'bunga bunga' sex parties, where young women would strip at his private villa.

He survived a public scandal after there were allegations that some of the women were underage.

The flamboyant billionaire had insisted this month that he would continue his political activities despite the positive virus test.

Regional elections are to be held in Italy this weekend as well as a referendum on reducing the number of deputies in parliament.
