Three-time Grammy winner Adam Levine warmly recalled how Kelly Preston - who passed away, age 57, on July 12 - taught him how to 'movie kiss' as his leading lady in the 2004 MILF fantasy music video, She Will Be Loved.

'I wouldn't say I jammed my tongue down her throat but I would say I gave her a real French kiss. I'll never forget it as long as I live,' the 41-year-old Maroon 5 frontman told Sirius XM's The Howard Stern Show on Tuesday.

'I go in to kiss her and she's like, "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, cowboy!" I was like, "What did I do?" She's like, "You don't use the tongue."'

Sophie Muller directed The Graduate-inspired video wherein Adam gets seduced by his girlfriend's socialite mother after he discovers her beaten up by her wealthy husband.

Levine gushed that the Honolulu-born actress 'was super cool' and made him 'feel comfortable' calling it 'one of those isolated, beautiful experiences.'

'The video wound up becoming this classic video that everyone loves,' the Nobody's War hitmaker noted. 'I never got to speak to her about it. Life goes on and obviously, we never crossed paths again. I was so sad to hear that news, man...It's so crazy that she passed away. It blows me away. I can't even believe it.' 

Kelly (Gotti, Jerry Maguire, Citizen Ruth) succumbed to a secret, two-year battle with breast cancer at her family's Clearwater, Florida home.

Her final screen role - as Cassie - alongside Dame Judi Dench in Jules Williamson's European train-set dramedy Off the Rails is currently in post-production.

Preston is survived by her 20-year-old daughter Ella Bleu and nine-year-old son Benjamin from her 29-year marriage to two-time Oscar nominee John Travolta.

Meanwhile, Adam has two daughters - Dusty Rose, turning 4 next Monday; and Gio Grace, 2 - from his six-year marriage to South African model Behati Prinsloo.

Levine's interview came two months after his LA band's bass player Mickey Madden announced he was 'taking leave of absence' after being arrested June 27 on domestic violence charges.
