David and Victoria Beckham are said to have caught CORONAVIRUS while partying in LA, California back in March.

According to a new report, the couple feared they were 'super-spreaders' after flying back to the UK for son Brooklyn's 21st birthday before jetting back over to America, to spend time in Miami, Florida - all within the space of two weeks.

It has been claimed that it was in Miami that the football legend, 45, began to feel unwell, with his designer wife, 46, developing a sore throat and a high temperature soon after, and several of their staff also catching the virus.

A source told The Sun: 'It was an absolute nightmare scenario,' explaining how David was in LA schmoozing on behalf of his club Inter Miami, when Victoria and their children flew over to support him.

'They attended a couple of swanky networking events as David had promotional duties, and were shaking hands and kissing fans and various club dignitaries,' claimed the insider.

The footballer and the former Spice Girl then flew back to London where they went to their Cotswolds estate to celebrate their eldest son's 21st birthday in style. 

The couple then flew to Miami, which is when David reportedly started to feel unwell and soon after Victoria developed a sore throat and a high temperature.

The source claimed that several of the Beckhams' team, including drivers, bodyguards and PAs - also fell ill, 'a couple of them very badly so'.

According to the insider, Victoria 'really panicked' and forced the entire family to quarantine rigidly for more than the required two week period, defined by the UK government.

'She was utterly petrified they might be super-spreaders, and did all she could to minimise all future risk,' said the source.  

It has also been claimed that, after making full recoveries, the couple checked in regularly with their team.

They allegedly sent 'care packages' to at least two staff members who were particularly badly affected.

The Beckhams then spent lockdown quarantined in their country manor, which boasts a swimming pool, hot tub, and of course a football pitch. 

Following their recovery from COVID-19, Victoria and David are said to have had swab and antibody tests to ensure they no longer had the virus, before jetting off on holiday to Greece and Italy. 

David Beckham's representatives declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
