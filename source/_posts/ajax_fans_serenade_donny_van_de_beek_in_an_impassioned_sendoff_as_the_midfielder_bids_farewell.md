Ajax supporters gave Donny van de Beek some send-off following Holland's defeat to Italy on Monday night as he gets ready to join up with his new Manchester United team-mates.

Van de Beek signed for United in a Â£40million deal after emerging as one of the brightest talents around with Ajax and following his move, the club's fans made sure the Dutch star would receive an emotional farewell.Â 

After Holland's 1-0 loss against Italy in the UEFA Nations League, Ajax fans rocked up outside the Johan Cruyff Arena as the country's players were leaving the stadium.

Een ereronde in een volle JC Arena zit er nu even niet in, maar je kunt Donny natuurlijk niet zomaar laten gaan. En dus kwam de F-side na #nedita bij elkaar om Van de Beek binnen te mogelijkheden uit te zwaaien. Want Donny is er eentje van ons! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ #ajax pic.twitter.com/kdz55JMrz1

Of Donny dit geÃ¯mproviseerde afscheid iets vond? Absoluut! Check dit dankwoordje maar. En je ziet ook gewoon dat het Van de Beek iets doet. Succes in Manchester, Ajacied! ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º #ajax pic.twitter.com/LRT9wzhdOT

And as Van de Beek drove away from the stadium, he was stopped in his tracks by Ajax fans as they serenaded the 23-year-old with personal songs before letting off red flares.

The midfielder was clearly hugely appreciative of the fans' gesture that he got out of his car and clapped them back as they said their goodbyes.

Van de Beek joined Ajax's academy back in 2008 and went on to become a fan favourite in Amsterdam.

Van de Beek, who scored 41 goals and created 34 assists in 175 matches for the club, won the Eredivisie title in 2018-19 while also playing an instrumental role in his side's run to the Champions League semi-finals the same season.Â

The Dutchman, who has moved to Old Trafford on a five-year contract, enjoyed an emotional ending to his night after enduring a tough time on the pitch for his country on Monday.

Van de Beek was substituted after 57 minutes against Italy following a below-par performance for Holland.

And after the final whistle, a Chelsea supporter took to Twitter to mock his performance - claiming he spent 57 minutes in 'Jorginho's pocket'.

During his time on the pitch, Van de Beek made just five passes, completed only one successful dribble and had a mere one shot on target.

He will be desperate to put that performance behind him when he links up with his new United team-mates ahead of the new Premier League season.

He became Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first signing of the summer transfer window and could form an exciting midfield partnership with Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba as United look to make inroads with Liverpool and Manchester City.Â
