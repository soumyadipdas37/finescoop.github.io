She is a successful fashion designer who regularly showcases her looks to her legions of social media followers.

And Victoria Beckham cut an elegant figure as she shared a snap of herself showing off an outfit from her collection.

The businesswoman, 46, donned a lemon long-sleeved top with a turtle neck along with a pair of teal, high-waisted trousers.

The former Spice Girl showed off her modelling chops as she posed with a hand on her hip in the mirror.

Victoria let her brunette locks fall loose down her shoulders while she completed her look with a light pallet of makeup.

Alongside the snap, she wrote: 'The perfect colour pairing for a sunny day in London. Wearing the high-waisted bright mint trousers from my #VB collection x vb'.

It comes after scaffolding has gone up at the Beckhams' neighbour's house in West London, signalling the start of the renovation project originally contested by Victoria and her husband David.

And according to The Sun, this means the famous couple will be facing 10 hours a day of construction noise.

The pair - who live in the £31 million Holland Park pad with their four children - attempted to block the plans when they were first submitted, winning the case back in April.

But since then, the neighbours have resubmitted the drafts and they have now been approved.

MailOnline has approached a rep for comment.

David successfully blocked the original renovation plans, claiming they will spoil the setting of his property. 

The former England captain, 45, voiced his concerns in an objection submitted to his local council which claims that the plans would spoil the uniqueness of house.

Under plans submitted to Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council, Beckham's neighbour Edward Harris intended to reconfigure the interior of his mews property which has just one bedroom, a dressing room, a shower, a garage and an open plan living room and dining area.

He also wanted to add new lightwells on the roof to bring in natural light into the property, fit new sliding windows and a new slate roof.

An outdoor courtyard and new staircase were also listed in the plans - which were rejected by officials in December.

Mr Harris's mews property is located just behind the Beckham's mansion. 

Imposition: Beckham complained that his neighbour's plan would flood light into the Beckham mansion and also spoil the local area in Holland Park, west London. Pictured is the west entrance to Holland Park Mews, where the neighbour's property is located

Mr Harris purchased the property for £1.9 million in November 2019, land registry records reveal. 

But shortly after his renovation plans were submitted in October, representatives London Projects Ltd acting on behalf of the Beckham's lodged an objection. 

Their letter said: 'My clients have concerns about the damage the proposal would cause to the history of the mews as well as the appearance and potential light spillage from the not insubstantial proposed roof light to the main roof.

'My clients purchased their property because they liked the style and history of the house and the area.

'This application seeks to spoil that with unsympathetic and inappropriate alterations and we would urge you to resist the proposals.' 

The letter added: 'The introduction of the rather large and protruding roof light to the main roof raises significant concerns for our clients.

'The roof light will be highly visible in views from their property and is likely to light up like a beacon at night.'

Plans: Mr Harris had wanted to add new lightwells on the roof to bring in natural light into the property, fit new sliding windows and a new slate roof. An outdoor courtyard and new staircase were also planned

Overlooking: Mr Harris also wanted to install a skylight at his property - which the Beckhams argued would flood their home with light

They continued: 'The proposal to demolish all but the front facade of this listed building would result in substantial harm to the listed building.'

Mr Harris' planning agent, Ben Smith Architecture, said: 'We are proposing to reconfigure the ground and first floors with the addition of an external courtyard to the rear, reducing the internal area by 10 sqm.

'The loft space is open, with a reduced area of approximately 20 sqm. The total proposed floor area is approximately 80 per cent of the existing.

'The proposed layout retains the garage and entrance doors and introduces a new staircase and courtyard at the rear.

'The living space upstairs is opened up and the bedroom located on the ground floor.'

Appealed: Mr Harris' property is at Holland Park Mews, just behind the Beckhams. The council rejected his plans, which he then resubmitted for approval

The Beckhams were successful in blocking the extension, after officials ruled against the plans in December.  

Sue Foster, director of planning and place at Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council, said: 'The significant loss of the internal arrangement would remove much of the internal floor plan at upper level.

'Furthermore, the loss of the existing roof profile and new roof addition would be detrimental to the original architectural proportions and character of the listed building and will contribute to further piecemeal erosion of the roofscape of the mews houses. 

'The special character of the listed building will therefore not be preserved and is contrary to CL4 and CL8 of the Local Plan.' 

David and Victoria bought their Holland Park home in September 2013 with the grand property dubbed Beckingham Palace II along with an adjacent smaller Mews property.

Shortly after, the multi-millionaires submitted 50 planning applications to renovate their pad and successfully battled one neighbour's objection to installing air conditioning in five rooms.

During the building work, the family lived in a rented house on the same road, before finally moving in during summer 2016.

The six-bedroom house was built in the mid-19th century, and features six bedrooms, a gym, cinema room, play room and spa room.

Meanwhile, a seventh bedroom was converted into a dressing room and beauty room for David and Victoria's extensive wardrobe. 

The exclusive area has been dubbed a 'millionaire's row' with other famous residents including Elton John and Robbie Williams.
