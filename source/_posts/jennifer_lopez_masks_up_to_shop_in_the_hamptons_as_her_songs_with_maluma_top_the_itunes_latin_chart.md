Two-time Grammy nominee Jennifer Lopez dressed down to shop at Blue & Cream in East Hampton with friends on Saturday.

The normally glamorous 51-year-old pop diva - who owns a $10M eight-bedroom mansion in Walter Mill - wrapped up in a cozy cardigan over a simple white T-shirt and blue skinny jeans for her excursion.

Jennifer made sure to protect herself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a white mask, which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made mandatory for all public outings way back on April 15.
