Generous singer Sia has donated thousands of dollars to a 60-year-old man who has lost his wife, job and home, all in the short space of a few months.

Radio hosts Fitzy and Wippa struggled to contain their emotions on Friday as they told Steve, a listener whose wife died of breast cancer on Mother's Day this year, that the Chandelier star was giving the father-of-two $20,000 to help pay his bills. 

Steve's daughter had asked the radio hosts to help her dad get back on his feet after Sia pledged $100, 000 to Nova FM to be given out to deserving recipients amid the coronavirus pandemic, last month. 

Sweet charity: She's known for her generosity, and on Friday, Sia helped out a 60-year-old man who had lost his wife, job and home, all in the short space of a few months. Pictured at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards in Los Angeles in March 201

'We've heard about your story, 2020 to say the least for a lot of people has been a shocker, and yours in particular,' Wippa, 40, told Steve via FaceTime on Friday.

Despite falling on hard times, Steve said his main concern was for his two daughters, and 'making sure they're okay and get through this'.  

Fitzy, 43, then told Steve that the show had decided to help out by giving him $10,000 to help pay his bills.

'People don't like to talk about this, they bottle it up. We need to talk about these things...' explained Fitzy. 

'We've got an amazing artist Sia who's come on board as well, and from a couple of mates, we want to tell you we've got your back and we want to get you back up on your feet.'

Clearly moved, Steve told the radio hosts their assistance was 'very much appreciated' and called their generosity 'unbelievable'.

The duo then told Steve they were going to give him another $10,000 so he could pay off his late wife's car.

Finally, an emotional Fitzy told Steve they were also going to build a bench seat in the cemetery in memory of his late wife, so he'd have somewhere to sit whenever he visited her grave. 

Last month, Sia  pledged $100, 000 to Nova FM to be given out to deserving recipients amid the coronavirus pandemic.

She said at the time: 'I like do-gooding. Maybe wanna do something together? Like, maybe I'll give you guys $100,000 that you can give out to people?'
