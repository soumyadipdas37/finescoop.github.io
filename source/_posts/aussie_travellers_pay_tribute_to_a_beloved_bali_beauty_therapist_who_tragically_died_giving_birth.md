Tributes have begun pouring in online for a beloved Balinese beauty therapist who was popular among Australian travellers after she tragically died giving birth. 

Anik Mesari passed away earlier this week due to complications following an emergency C-section. She was 30 weeks pregnant.

The mother leaves behind her husband, daughter and new baby boy who is now in neonatal care.    

She was the owner of popular salon Mesari beauty studio which is frequented by myriads of overseas visitors.

A NSW woman broke the heartbreaking news with fellow Indonesia fanatics in Facebook group Bali Bogans.   

'For those of you that have been to Mesari beauty, it is with great sadness I announce Anik has passed away,' she wrote.

'If you knew her or even walked in to Mesari, you would of been greeted with the biggest smile.' 

'She was one of the loveliest ladies I've ever come across and her hugs, kindness and smile will be truly missed. Her beautiful soul will live on forever.'

The post attracted more than a 1000 reactions in an hour, with Australians describing her as an 'amazing' and 'beautiful' woman.

'That is so sad and heart breaking. She was a beautiful beautiful lady,' one person replied.

'Such a wonderful person. Fly high Anik and may you rest in peace,' another added.

'She is the most amazing person I saw her in March. My heart breaks,' a third comment read. 

One woman wrote that it is the second tragedy to rock the family in the past 12 months after Ms Mesari lost a son last year.  

Friends from Australia have rallied together to set up a fundraiser via her Facebook page to help her loved ones.

'Anik was the kindest, happiest and most loyal Balinese lady I have ever meet and will be sadly missed,' Natalie Baldwin wrote. 

'Unfortunately in Bali they don’t get government assistance like in Australia so if you can help with even $5 it would be appreciated.' 

'I know it’s a crazy time right now but this is the least I can do for such a beautiful person. 

Those wishing to donate can transfer directly to Ms Mesari's family's bank account listed on her Facebook page or by getting into contact with Ms Baldwin.
