Clarke Peters broke down in tears as he paid tribute to his Da 5 Bloods co-star Chadwick Boseman on Monday's Good Morning Britain.

The actor, 68, appeared via videolink to discuss the Black Panther star's shock death from colon cancer on Friday aged 43.

Clarke also said that Chadwick's 'mission is complete' and people should 'celebrate' that as much as they can.

Heartbreaking: Clarke Peters broke down in tears as he paid tribute to his Da 5 Bloods co-star Chadwick Boseman on Monday's Good Morning Britain

He said: 'We've lost a very sweet soul. We've lost a fine actor, we've lost a man of integrity, what we've gained is a man who put a lot of younger people of colour on track. 

'If everyone has a purpose in life, he certainly played the role of a hero in many, many ways.'

The actor revealed he had spoken to Chadwick about believing in God, he said: 'His mission is complete. We should celebrate that and take from it as much as we can.

'For most people of colour, we needed to have these heroes who are not pimps, who are not killers, who are not robbers, who are not drug addicts. That was my generation.'

Emotional: Clarke also said that Chadwick's 'mission is complete' and people should 'celebrate' that as much as they can

He continued: 'We're living in a time where things are moving fast. He had to be here for the time he was here to do what he did and he did it well. Someone said he's resting in peace with the angels, I said "No, he's probably flying with them now."

Clarke then broke down in tears as he admitted that he thought Chadwick was 'precious' for having people with him on set during filming for Da 5 Bloods in 2019 in Thailand. He had no idea he was privately battling colon cancer.

He said: 'We were shooting in Thailand actually and when I look back at that time, I have to say with a little bit of regret that I probably wasn't the most altruistic in that environment, but hindsight teaches us a lot of things. 

'And what I'm addressing is basically, my wife asked what Chadwick was like and I was really excited to work with him. I said, "I think he's a little bit precious" and she said "Why?"

Regrets: Clarke then broke down in tears as he admitted that he thought Chadwick was 'precious' for having people with him on set during filming for Da 5 Bloods in 2019 in Thailand. He had no idea he was privately battling colon cancer 

'And I said, "Because he's surrounded by people who are fawning over him - a Chinese practitioner who's massaging his back when he walks off set, he's got a make up lady who's massaging his feet, his girlfriend is there holding his hand".

'I'm thinking "Well maybe the Black Panther thing went to his head."

Clarke then broke down in tears as he admitted: 'But now I regret even having those thoughts because they were really looking after him.' 

Chadwick was also hailed a 'trooper' by Spike Lee, who revealed he was unaware the late star was battling cancer as he directed him in one of his final films. 

Upsetting: The actor revealed he had spoken to Chadwick about believing in God, he said: 'His mission is complete. We should celebrate that and take from it as much as we can.' 

The filmmaker, 63, recalled working with the late actor last year on the Vietnam War film Da 5 Bloods as he hosted his annual Brooklyn ♥ MJ block party online to mark late singer Michael Jackson's 62nd birthday on Saturday.

Dedicating Michael Jackson's classic 1991 track Gone Too Soon to Boseman, he said: 'We filmed Da 5 Bloods in Thailand, and it was hot, jungles, mountains, and Chadwick was there with us all the way. 

'I never, ever suspected that anything was wrong. No one knew he was going through treatment, chemotherapy.'

He continued: 'Chadwick, a trooper, never complained. He was there every single minute in the moment.

'And his performance is a testament to what he put into that role, and all his roles. We miss you, Chadwick, we're going to celebrate your life.'

Spike also paid tribute to the actor on his Instagram account, sharing a series of heartfelt posts, one of which included a deleted scene from Netlfix film Da 5 Bloods that featured Boseman singing Marvin Gaye's God Is Love.

'That scene got me when we were shooting it,' the filmmaker said. 'Watching that again this morning just tore me up.'

Chadwick's family issued a statement on his Instagram on Friday about his death. They penned: 'It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman. 

Unaware: Spike said of the actor, 'I never, ever suspected that anything was wrong. No one knew he was going through treatment, chemotherapy.' Pictured together in 2013

'Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV. A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much.'

The family revealed several of Boseman's recent films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, and August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, were filmed 'during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy.'

'It was the honour of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther,' the statement said. 'The family thanks you for your love and prayers, and asks that you continue to respect their privacy during this difficult time.'

Boseman is survived by his wife Taylor Simone Ledward and a parent and had no children, his publicist said. The actor had kept his diagnosis and much of his personal life under wraps.
