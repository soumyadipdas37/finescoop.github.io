She was in good company as she joined her husband David and three of their children at her digital London Fashion Week presentation earlier this week.

And Victoria Beckham treated her Instagram followers to a behind-the-scenes look at the event for her eponymous line's latest collection on Monday.

The designer, 46, was focused on delivering the best show ever as she was seen personally styling the models backstage, before kneeling to the ground to take slick photos of the outfits.

The images also showed a catwalk star twirling around on a podium in a flowy animal print dress, before nailing business chic by switching into a longline coat and smart trousers.

Models' features were complemented with stunning looks created by hair and make-up artists, who sported protective face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Posh Spice stunned in high-waisted indigo jeans and a cream silk blouse with a black pussy bow feature – both from the spring/summer '21 collection of her eponymous brand.

Standing tall in a pair of vertiginous heels, which were shrouded by her lengthy wide leg jeans, the musician accessorised with a selection of sparkling gold jewellery by Tiffany. 

She opted to style her chestnut brown tresses in a sleek bun, while her famous good looks were highlighted with a palette of makeup featuring soft and nude tones.

Toting a large brown leather handbag, in which she strategically placed a patterned silk scarf, the mother-of-four commanded attention ahead of her show.

The media personality was met with praise by Dior Mens' artistic director Kim Jones, who gifted her with a bouquet of flowers and a handwritten note which read: 'Dear Victoria, congratulations! With lots of love.'

Former footballer David, 45, proved he has passed on his style to two of his sons Romeo, 18, and Cruz, 15, as he took them, along with their sister Harper, nine, to Victoria's fashion event in a series of garish looks. 

Following the show, the sportsman took to Instagram to make a joke out of his socks and sandals look.

Victoria was forced to ditch her usual catwalk show in favour of a digital presentation, but she had her number one fans by her side as they attended in their somewhat edgy ensembles.
