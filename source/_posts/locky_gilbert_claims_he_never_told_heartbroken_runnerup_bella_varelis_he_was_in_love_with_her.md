He's been copping backlash from Bachelor fans for telling runner-up Bella Varelis that he was 'falling in love' with her, before dumping her. 

But now leading man Locky Gilbert has pointed out a crucial detail that everyone missed. 

Speaking on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday alongside winner Irena Srbinovska, the 31-year-old claimed he never technically told Bella he was in love.

It came after he dropped the L-word to both of the girls during the two-part grand finale. 

'I didn't say that exact same thing. It's a hot topic at the moment,' Locky said during the KIIS FM radio appearance. 

Host Jackie O chimed in, cluing on to what Locky was trying to say, saying: 'When you said "I've fallen in love."

Despite telling her earlier in the episode he was 'falling in love' with her, he changed his mind and said he could no longer see a future with her.

Locky is still dating Irena, 31, two months after filming the finale, and they plan to live together in Perth once they've finished promotional duties for The Bachelor.
