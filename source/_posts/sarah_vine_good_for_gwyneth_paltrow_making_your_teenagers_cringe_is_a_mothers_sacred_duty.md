This week, to celebrate turning 48, Gwyneth Paltrow decided to post a picture of herself in her birthday suit to her 7.4 million Instagram followers. As you do.

Standing coquettishly in front of some foliage, one arm across her chest, her right leg half-raised to protect her modesty, no doubt she hoped to project a picture of female beauty and empowerment (not to mention sell a few tubs of the Goop body butter she was promoting). And in many ways she succeeded.

For her 16-year-old daughter, however, it was a case of TMI ('too much information'). 'MOM,' she commented, making clear her embarrassment — to which Paltrow replied with a line of laughing emojis.

I don't need to pose naked to make my 17-year-old daughter cringe (a nation heaves a sigh of relief). My very existence is enough.

My sins, apparently, include 'always trying to cook for me', asking her friends questions about themselves (where they live, where they're at school, what A-levels they're doing, would they like a sandwich) and posting adorable pictures of her on my own Instagram.

Guilty on all fronts. But, the truth is, I love embarrassing my children. In fact, I would go so far as to say I consider it my solemn parental duty to do so at every available opportunity.

The relationship between parent and teenager is a difficult one. On the one hand, they still need you; on the other, they are desperate to break free. You love them deeply and enjoy seeing them come into their own. But there's a price.

They do annoying things such as invite friends over who steal your wine and then throw up in your bathroom, blocking the sink for days before they come clean about it. Then they go on the defensive, arguing that it's all your fault for having wine in the house in the first place.

They go to parties and forget to tell you they're not coming home; or they say they're sleeping over and then come home after all, only of course they've forgotten their key so they ring the doorbell at 4am, setting the dogs barking and waking the whole neighbourhood.

They 'borrow' your iPods and lose them, make themselves zucchini fritti at midnight (seriously, what's wrong with a bowl of cereal?), leave all the lights on (despite lecturing you about climate change), dye their hair using your best towels. They are an endless source of frustration — but also, of course, fascination.

When you consider the rap sheet, a bit of mild embarrassment is a small price to pay. More importantly, it's good for them. Takes them down a peg or two. Makes them realise there are other people in the world apart from themselves.

Some parents go out of their way not to embarrass their children. You see them walking several steps behind their offspring like cowed wives. But parents who alter their behaviour to curry favour with their teenagers inevitably end up losing the battle. If you allow your child to dictate how you live your life, you are not raising a well-rounded human being, you're raising a spoilt brat.

So whether it's Paltrow in her birthday suit, or Liz Hurley in her bikinis, or Ulrika Jonsson documenting her transition from thongs to 'apple catcher' big pants, we embarrassing mums must stick together.

My current line of attack involves joining my local ward action group in an attempt to clean up my local park, which has become overrun with drug dealers. This, my son (15, peak teen) informs me, qualifies me as a 'Karen', which is possibly the most embarrassing anyone can be.

Naturally, I take great delight in telling all his friends about my efforts. As Paltrow herself might put it.  

Unpaid carers have spent an additional 92 million hours looking after loved ones with dementia since lockdown, according to new figures from the Alzheimer's Society — with women (as ever) bearing the brunt.

Seeing as the Treasury is handing out sweeties to all and sundry, shouldn't the Government also consider extending some of its largesse to this army of selfless stalwarts without whom, quite frankly, the NHS would be overwhelmed?

And deliver on its promise to, as the Prime Minister said on the steps of No 10 back in those heady days of August 2019, 'fix the crisis in social care once and for all'.

It was my godson's birthday at the weekend and, in accordance with current guidance, he and five friends went paintballing. As his mother pointed out, had they been real guns, and they were heading for a grouse moor, he could have made up a posse of 30. Funny old world.

Don't snicker, Joan's far from a diva

I loved Rupert Everett's cheerfully self- deprecating new autobiography, extracted this week in the Daily Mail.

Here's a man who is honest enough to own his mistakes and inadequacies. Like the time he accidentally stood up Dame Joan Collins. 'And Joan and I don't speak for years,' he remarks ruefully.

I have to say I find this hard to believe: Joan may be a diva but, in my experience, she is far from diva-esque. Years ago, I invited her for supper, having met her at a political fundraiser. To my astonishment, she agreed. The evening was marked by several culinary disasters, not least an exploding quail's egg (I had undercooked them), which erupted all down her silk blouse.

But perhaps the worst part was when my son, then aged seven or eight, came downstairs and said to Joan: 'Are you that lady from the Snickers advert?' I was mortified, but Joan replied: 'Why, darling, thank you. Yes, I am.' 'Although,' she added, shooting a devilish Alexis wink at the table, 'I've been in one or two other things, too.'

Much reaching for the smelling salts at Broadcasting House after news that veteran conservative Charles Moore is being lined up as chairman of the BBC. 

A friend, who knows him quite well, is surprised, since, as far as she is aware, Charles doesn't really watch television. 

Oh, to be a fly on the wall as Moore is introduced to the more 'cutting-edge' areas of BBC output. It would knock Gogglebox's Giles and Mary into a cocked hat.

A load of noodles

Parents of students locked down at university have been complaining of 'inadequate' food parcels being sent to their little darlings — including baked beans, Pot Noodles and tins of chicken meatballs.

When I was at university, such things were considered delicacies, beer being the prevailing food group. What really made me laugh was one parent's complaint that, even though her daughter had 'advised she is vegan', her college had failed to provide adequately.

Comforting to know that, even in a global pandemic, there are some people for whom not having access to tofu and avocados is still the worst of their worries.

Given the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's fiercely protective attitude towards their privacy, doesn't it seem a little strange that they were reportedly offering to make public — as part of their deal with Netflix — highly personal home videos detailing their departure from the Royal Family? Or is it just a bit different when there's $100 million in the offing? 

Trump's hair-raising expenses

The most astonishing thing about the Donald Trump's tax revelations (it is said that he paid just $750 in federal income in 2016 after expenses and deductions) is that he claimed $70,000 for his hair. Correction: for that hair.

That's roughly the price of five or six top-notch transplants. I think he —or the American taxpayer — should ask for his money back.
