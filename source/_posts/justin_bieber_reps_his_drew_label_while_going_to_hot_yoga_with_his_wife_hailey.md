Justin Bieber and his wife Hailey looked inseparable on Saturday as they stepped out for some exercise as a couple.

The 26-year-old pop superstar and the 23-year-old model walked hand-in-hand in Los Angeles as they arrived for a hot yoga class together.

The couple arrived in complementary bright outfits, with Justin advertising his Drew clothing label in a yellow shirt featuring the brand's name over the chest, while Hailey rocked an unmissable set of skin-tight orange shorts.

Justin stayed on theme with a set of gray Drew shorts, and he wore simple off-white trainers with tall white socks.

The Sorry singer also covered up his shaggy quarantine hairdo with an olive-colored Nike toque. 

Hailey showed off her svelte legs in her shorts and wore her baggy gray shirt tucked up to reveal a hint of her toned midriff.

The daughter of Stephen Baldwin wore a matching neon orange sports bra and had her blonde tresses tied back in a tight bun.

Hailey accessorized with a black handbag held under her arm, and she wore a pair of brown Yeezy slides while sipping on an iced coffee.

Both Biebers wore black masks to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus as they arrived at the yoga studio.

The sky was a hazy gray color due to wildfires raging near Los Angeles that have filled the sky with smoke, even as California residents to the north in the Bay Area have been subjected to apocalyptic orange skies. 

Later in the day, Hailey tried to capture video of the sky and sun on her Instagram Stories.

Her iPhone color corrected some of the haze, but still showed an unusual orange sun due to all the particles in the air, which has ranged from 'unhealthy' to 'hazardous' in recent days, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Justin and Hailey arrived back in Los Angeles last week following a short trip to the wooded paradise of Idaho's Coeur d'Alene, a welcome respite from California's recent heat waves and wildfires.

After returning home, Hailey shared multiple photos of the two enjoying time on a boat on Lake Coeur d'Alene and showing off some major PDA.

Hailey shared a cute photo of the married couple embracing on a boat, as well as a shot that showed off her trim physique and her black bikini.

The daughter of Stephen even has a tattoo reading 'coeur d'Alene' under her left shoulder blade, though it's for her sister Alaia's middle name, rather than the popular tourist attraction.

On Friday, Justin shared a cryptic blue-tinted photo of himself in a striped shirt and shorts.

The Let Me Love You Singer simply captioned it, '1 week,' which has left his fans wondering if he might be preparing to release new music.

Back in February, he released his fifth studio album Changes, which had been led by the underwhelming single Yummy.

The album debuted atop the charts, though it received middling reviews from critics. 

Coming soon? On Friday, Justin shared a cryptic photo captioned, '1 week,' which some fans have speculated means he's about to release more music
