Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will sign a new deal worth an initial £250,000-per-week in a major boost to Arsenal for the new season.

Captain Aubameyang, 31, is poised to commit his future to the club after finalising an improved contract that will run until 2023.

The Gabon striker, whose first Arsenal deal was worth £200,000-per-week, will receive a hike in his basic wage in the fresh contract.

Further bonuses could make the new agreement worth in excess of £300,000-a-week and potentially take his earnings beyond current top earner, £350,000-per-week Mesut Ozil.

Aubameyang has scored 71 goals in 110 appearances for Arsenal and the contract he signed when he joined for £56m from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018 was due to expire next summer.

Aubameyang's new three-year deal at Arsenal is set to be worth an initial £250,000-per-week

The 31-year-old's new contract is set to be a major boost to Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta

His new deal was verbally agreed last month and Arsenal are now on the verge of officially confirming he has extended his stay.

Aubameyang played a crucial part in Arsenal's FA Cup success last season, scoring a brace in the semi-final win against Manchester City before repeating the feat against Chelsea in the final.

He has mainly been used out wide by Mikel Arteta and will hope to hit the ground running when Arsenal start the new Premier League campaign away to Fulham on Saturday.
