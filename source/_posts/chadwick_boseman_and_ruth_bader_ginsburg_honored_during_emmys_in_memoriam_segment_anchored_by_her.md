The In Memoriam segment of the 2020 Emmy Awards held Sunday night in Los Angeles began with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and ended with Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman.

The annual reflection on the luminaries lost during the preceding 12 months took on an added poignancy, taking place as it did in the empty Staples Center where host Jimmy Kimmel emcee'd proceedings without the usual live and star-studded audience due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As Grammy-winning recording artist H.E.R. performed Prince's Nothing Compares 2 U, famously covered by Sinead O'Connor, photos and names of these who had passed away flashed up on screen. 

'We lost a great American': Emmys host Jimmy Kimmel paid tribute to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died Friday as he introduced the Emmys In Memoriam segment

Heartfelt: The tribute concluded with the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman as Grammy-winning recording artist H.E.R. performed Nothing Compares 2 U

Introducing the In Memoriam montage, Kimmel spoke about the loss of Ginsburg who died Friday night at age 87 due to complications from metastatic pancreas cancer.

She had served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 until her death. 

'On Friday, we lost a great American,' Kimmel said. 'Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a passionate and tireless champion of equality and justice whose legacy was to make life a little better for people less fortunate than she.'

He then added: 'Sounds like pretty good words to live by to me.' 

Song for them: H.E.R. - real name Gabriella Wilson - began her performance seated at a piano accompanying herself on the poignant track famously covered by Sinead O'Connor

Reflection: The annual reflection on the luminaries lost during the preceding 12 months took on an added poignancy, taking place as it did against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic

Pandemic backdrop: The Emmys, which honor the best in television, was hosted from LA's Staples Center by Jimmy Kimmel without the usual live and star-studded audience 

Missed: Comedian, actor, writer and director Carl Reiner was remembered. He passed in June at 98 after a very long and successful Hollywood career

Gone: Daytime chat show host Regis Philbin, who died at age 88 in July, was also remembered in the segment

H.E.R. - real name Gabriella Wilson - began her performance seated at a piano accompanying herself on the poignant track.

The singer, 23, who was wearing a custom Vera Wang gown, later moved center stage to conclude her rendition while playing the electric guitar.

Included in the tribute was Diana Rigg, who died on September 10 at the age of 82.

Other stars included chat show host Regis Philbin, comedy icons Carl Reiner, Fred Willard and Jerry Stiller, the late Glee star Naya Rivera and actors Wilford Brimley, Naya Rivera, Iam Holm, Brian Dennehy, Honor Blackman, Max von Sydow and Kirk Douglas. 

Soulful performance: H.E.R., who was wearing a custom Vera Wang gown, later moved center stage to conclude her rendition while playing the electric guitar

Loss: Included in the tribute was Diana Rigg, who died on September 10 at the age of 82

Big moment: The singer, 23, poured her heart into her performance

As always, the Emmys acknowledged that not every celebrity who died this year would be featured in the telecast tribute.

However, in order to try and honor everyone who passes, the Emmys do maintain an extensive In Memoriam tribute on their website. 

Noticeably absent, though, was actor Nick Cordero who succumbed to complications of COVID-19 in July at age 41.

While he was well-known as a star of Broadway and musical theater, Cordero had also appeared in numerous TV shows over the span of his career including Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Blue Bloods and Queer as Folk.

Also left out was L.A. Lakers star Kobe Brytan who was killed in a helicopter crash in January.

The basketball pro had won a Sports Emmy for his animated short Dear Basketball for which he also won an Oscar in 2018.
