The Swedish royal family wrapped up against the cool autumn breeze as they took a guided art tour through a park in Stockholm today.

King Carl Gustaf, 74, and his wife Queen Silvia, 76, were joined by Crown Princess Victoria, 43, and her husband Prince Daniel, 47, as they strolled through the Djurgarden royal park today.

King Carl appeared relaxed on the family outing, which saw the foursome joined by the King's dog Brandie.

The chic-looking royal also wore her hair in a tight low ponytail and opted for a pared-down, natural make up look.

As the weather turns colder, Silvia, also wore a detailed floral scarf and a pair of black leather gloves. 

All the royal family members made sure to keep a safe distance between themselves, in line with the coronavirus pandemic restrictions, but none of them wore masks.

Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, who used to be her personal trainer, are parents to Princess Estelle, eight, and Prince Oscar, four. 

As well as Victoria, the King and Queen have two other children - Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland, married to Princess Sofia, Duchess of Värmland, and Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, married to Christopher O'Neill.

Their outing comes days after Sweden recorded its fewest daily cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic's peak in March.  

The Scandinavian country, which was initially criticised for not implementing a lockdown, is now seeing significantly fewer cases than other European hotspots. 

Queen Silvia held onto an information booklet while strolling through the park, accompanied by her family and a host of royal aides

Sweden kept open schools for children under 16, banned gatherings of more than 50 people and told over-70s and vulnerable groups to self-isolate.

Shops, bars and restaurants stayed open throughout the pandemic and the wearing of masks has not been advised by the government.

In Sweden, the death rate has been falling steadily since April despite a peak of cases in the summer - with the country's top epidemiologist saying that deaths can be kept low without drastic lockdown measures.
