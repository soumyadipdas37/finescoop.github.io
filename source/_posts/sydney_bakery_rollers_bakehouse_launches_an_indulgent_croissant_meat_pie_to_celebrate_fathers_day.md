A Sydney bakery is celebrating Father's Day with the launch of a unique croissant meat pie.

Created by Rollers Bakehouse in the northern beachside suburb of Manly, the limited-edition pie crust is filled with slow-cooked beef ribs from Fairlight Butcher and topped with a buttery croissant lid.

The meat is coated in a spicy dry rub of paprika, onion powder, garlic, cumin, salt and black pepper, then marinated in brown sugar, golden syrup, beef stock and Worcestershire sauce for a powerful flavour explosion.

A post on the page of Fairlight Butcher – who supplies the meat for the pies – describes it as 'slow cooked to perfection, then packed generously into a classic pie with a croissant top'.

It comes with sweet chutney relish on the side, a gourmet upgrade from the classic tomato sauce usually supplied with pies.

No price has been listed for the croissant pie, but it's available this weekend from Friday to Sunday along with other decadent creations like sticky date scrolls and danish pastries stuffed with cookies and cream. 

And it's already proving a hit on the bakery's Instagram feed, where people have left comments like 'stop it', 'looks like the bees knees' and 'I want this now'.

'This looks like the best pie,' one woman said.

A second added 'now that's inventive!', while a third tagged her friend and wrote: 'When our two greatest loves collide.'

Rollers Bakehouse was launched by Australian entrepreneurs Bo Hinzack and James Sideris in July 2018 following two years of meticulous planning.

The duo wanted to share their love of good quality coffee, quirky snacks and unusual flavour combinations.

‘The idea is to have some fun with the croissant [and] just be adventurous with what we can achieve so when you bite into it it's like, "Holy s**t, that's different",' Mr Sideris told Broadsheet in an interview to mark the opening.

The bakery is open from 7am to 3pm Monday to Saturday and 7.30am to 2pm Sunday.
