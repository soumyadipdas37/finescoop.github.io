Fulham have signed Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Alphonse Areola on a season-long loan.

The Premier League newcomers also hold an option to make the 27-year-old France international's move permanent.

Areola has made over 100 appearances for PSG since making his debut in 2013 and was a member of France's World Cup-winning squad in 2018.

Areola told FFCtv: 'I am very happy everything is done.

'Scott Parker (Fulham manager) called me and I had a good feeling. He said he really wanted me.

'Fulham is a historic club in London and I have heard a lot about the stadium.

'I hope this season will be a good one for us. I want to bring my energy and do everything for this team to keep us where we belong to be.' 

He spent last season on loan at Real Madrid, where he picked up a LaLiga winner's medal.

Fulham sporting director Tony Khan said: 'I'm thrilled to welcome Alphonse Areola to our Fulham family.

'Alphonse has experience at the very highest level, as he's played in France's national team, won the league title with PSG, had success at RC Lens, Bastia and with Villarreal, and most recently he played for Real Madrid as they won LaLiga last season.

'We're excited that he's joining us, and he'll be an excellent addition to our squad for our Premier League campaign ahead.'
