The Arsenal board are very keen to sign Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar this summer. 

The Ligue 1 sensation would love to move to the Premier League but Lyon do not want to accept any swap deals.

Rudi Garcia's side have already turned down an offer from the Gunners which included cash plus Arsenal outcast Matteo Guendouzi.

Lyon want £55million for Aouar but Arsenal's technical director Edu has yet to submit another bid according to Fabrizio Romano. 

Manchester City are also reportedly set to compete with Arsenal for French midfielder Aouar according to The Mirror. 

Lyon sporting director Juninho has recently spoken out insisting that he isn't interested in a deal for Guendouzi.

He said: 'I get on very well with [Arsenal technical director] Edu, we spoke on the phone. Aouar is really appreciated by Mikel Arteta.

'Guendouzi was discussed during the call, he is a great player, but he is the wrong profile.

'We are not interested in that at all, we cut the conversation.'

Juninho added that Lyon have yet to receive a formal offer for Aouar. 'I think that has been happening directly with agents.'

However, Juninho did say that he is aware of Guardiola's interest.

He said: 'I think that has been happening directly with agents. 

'We were not directly contacted. Maybe [director general] Vincent Ponsot was contacted by Manchester City, I am not sure.'
