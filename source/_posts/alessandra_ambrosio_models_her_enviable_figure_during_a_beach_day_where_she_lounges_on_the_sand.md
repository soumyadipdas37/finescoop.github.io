She didn't let the errant smoke from the California wildfires stop her from enjoying a game of beach volleyball earlier this week in Malibu.

And on Saturday, supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio was again seen out enjoying a beach day with friends, this time in the Santa Monica area of Los Angeles.

The Brazilian catwalker, 39, showed off her dynamite figure as she engaged in various surfside activities, from sunbathing on the sand to playing more volleyball with family and friends.

The thong bottoms of the two-piece bathing suit she wore were especially teeny.   

She also wore an assortment of shorts while playing ball, including a pair of super-tiny blue mesh bottoms, as well as a pair of classic denim Daisy Dukes.

The mother-of-two also wore different eyewear, such as a pair of sporty violet Oakley-style wraparound shades as well as classic dark aviators.

'I've always tried to keep my beauty routine as simple as possible and that didn't change when I had my kids,' she said. 

'What I've focused on since having kids is creating time to take care of myself,' continued the workout queen. 

'Even if it's just 15 minutes in the morning for meditation, stretching or yoga - it helps me get centered and ready to conquer whatever the day is bringing my way.'

Alessandra is determined to ensure her kids learn the value of taking care of themselves, too.

Along with Anja Louise, Ambrosio is mom to son Noah Phoenix, eight. 

The model told the magazine: 'I make sure that I teach my kids the importance of taking care of themselves, so every morning we make delicious juices together and try to do some kind of outdoor activity.'

Beach change: The 5ft9in beauty also sported a pair of super-tiny blue mesh bottoms at one point, changing from her denim cutoffs 

Alessandra previously admitted that her children are her 'number-one priority'.

Ambrosio rose to international fame as a Victoria's Secret Angel, announcing that she was giving up the title at the end of 2017. 

Born in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande Do Sul, Alessandra has lived in the States for about two decades, having had to first move to New York City to kick off her successful modeling career as a teenager.
