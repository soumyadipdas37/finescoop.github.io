An Australian retail giant behind some of the country's most beloved brands has been slammed for taking nearly six months to pay some suppliers, despite claiming almost $60million in taxpayer funds. 

The development comes as leading retailer Premier Investments, which owns franchise stores such as Just Jeans, Portmans, Jay Jays, Smiggle and Peter Alexander, revealed a 29 per cent increase in takings to the tune of $137.8million last Friday.  

The surge in profit follows reports Premier Investments kept some frustrated suppliers waiting for up to 180 days for payment at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Premier Investments qualified for JobKeeper through the federal government’s wage subsidies program. 

Store takings were reduced at the height of the pandemic, meaning the company was eligible for the wage subsidy program, but across the past year sales have only been fractionally lower. 

The company claimed just under $60million in Jobkeeper subsidies, which were granted to big companies which saw a 30 per cent drop in turnover during the pandemic. 

Small Business Ombudsman Kate Carnell described the business behaviour as 'unethical.' 

'They are pushing out payment times to little guys that have nowhere to go, that are doing it tougher than anybody,' she told the Australian Financial Review.

'It is particularly unacceptable for big entities like Premier (Investments) to use late payments as a method of making their figures look better.'  

Typically, Australian retailers pay their suppliers after they have received the goods, usually 30 days following delivery.  

A Just Group spokesperson, who are owned by Premier Investments, said the pandemic led to a huge 'revenue impact'.

'Like many retailers, we sought support from suppliers for temporary flexibility in payment terms. 

'This formed one part of a package of measures adopted by the company to preserve its sustainability during a period of extreme turmoil. 

'With the gradual reopening of stores, Just Group has progressed towards more usual payment terms,' they said. 

Last week, Premier Investments also announced almost 350 of its stores could close across the nation leading into Christmas, with CEO Mark McInnes stating high rent costs and a rise in online sales are to blame.
