They frequently flaunt their bodies on social media. 

And Bianca Gascoigne, 33, and her boyfriend Kris Boyson, 29, were up to their old tricks once more on Monday as they took to social media to share a bizarre video. 

The ex-boyfriend of Katie Price spoke to the camera about the secret to great abs, before challenging followers to a bizarre task which saw his girlfriend - the step-daughter of football legend Paul Gascoigne - throw watermelons at his chest. 

Ouch! Bianca Gascoigne, 33, and her boyfriend Kris Boyson, 29, were up to their old tricks once more on Monday as they took to social media to share a bizarre video

Bianca looked pheneomenal in the hilarious video as she donned lemon yellow sportswear to best flaunt her incredibly toned frame. 

She wore her bouncy blonde locks in loose curls while assisting personal trainer Kris in his bizarre - and quite frankly - wasteful challenge. 

Speaking to the camera, Kris said: 'What's going on guys, so everyone keeps asking me what's the secret to abs, what the secret is. Well here it is'. 

He added a caption reading: 'The Secret to Instant Abs! Share to anyone you think can do it and tag them below. Big up @danagram_ & @lucyflight for the editing skills & @biancagascoigne1 for the pain'.

Bianca and Kris' video comes after she returned from Croatia on her first holiday with her beau Kris Boyson earlier this month. 

The reality star recently revealed she moved in with her personal trainer boyfriend after their first date in a interview. 

The couple took their relationship to the next level as they spent the UK's nationwide lockdown together just weeks after embarking on a romance. 

Despite dating for only five months, the reality stars admitted they'd definitely want to get married and start a family in the future as they 'completely trust' each other.

Katie Price's ex told new! magazine: 'We've spent every single day together practically since we met.  You wouldn't lock down with someone for 100 days if it was a showmance.' 

Bianca and Kris were introduced to each other three years ago when he provided her with healthy meals in preparation of a charity fight, which got cancelled when her opponent, his ex Katie Price, pulled out. 

They lost contact for a while, before fitness enthusiast Kris slid into her Instagram DMs earlier this year. 

The couple currently reside in Kent and are renovating their pad with a cinema room and a new bar.
