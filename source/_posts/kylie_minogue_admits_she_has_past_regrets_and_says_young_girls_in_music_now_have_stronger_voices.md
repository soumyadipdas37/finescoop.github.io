Kylie Minogue has admitted that she has past regrets and she thinks it's 'amazing' that younger girls in the music industry now have 'stronger voices'.

The Can't Get You Out of My Head hitmaker, 52, also revealed that she is a 'perfectionist', and as she's got older, she doesn't 'let things slide' in her life. 

Kylie joined Jessie Ware and her mother Lennie for her recent episode of Table Manners podcast, which was released on Wednesday.

Asked if she has any past regrets in her career, the Australian singer admitted: 'Yes, yes, of course I do. To name them... it's quite difficult.'

She explained: 'It's more like a little bit here, a little bit there, wish I hadn't have done that, a lot of wish I had done that differently, I could have done that better, why didn't I see what was happening.'

Kylie added that she is 'mostly' a perfectionist and in recent years she doesn't 'let things slide' after not always 'speaking up'.

She continued: 'Mostly [a perfectionist], there are some areas, when I'm really on the fence about something, it can go either way. 

'I'm not sure how correct I am in saying, in recent years, last five, ten years, whatever, where I am more... I don't let things slide, some things from the past... I've always had the idea, but haven't always spoken up.'

Recalling her experiences of being a young woman in the music industry, she added: 'So much noise, especially when I was younger, [I'd be like] "You're the grownups, I don't know, I'm new to all of this" even though it's really successful, it was learning on the job basically a lot of it.'

Fellow singer Jessie, 35, noted that sometimes in the music industry women have to feel 'apologetic' if you disagree with something, although she is finding it easier now she has more confidence.

To which Kylie replied: 'I think, thankfully, it does feel like it's changing.

'I try to, I'm sure you get younger people, on this show, it would be great to hear what they have to say about how they feel - not that they know what to compare it to as experience, but what they've read about, heard about.

'It does seem like the younger girls now have stronger voices and that's amazing.'

Kylie also spoke about working with Pete Waterman, who was one of her producers at the start of her music career, and how she navigated her role as Charlene Robinson on Neighbours with her music. 

She said: 'One of the reasons it worked well for me, I didn't know any different, there were unashamedly, and rightly so, called the Hit Factory.

'I'd come from being in a soap opera, where you get lines, say lines, then do next scene, so probably sounds so weird now to hear.

Regrets: Asked if she has any past regrets in her career, the Australian singer admitted: 'Yes, yes, of course I do. To name them... it's quite difficult.' (pictured in 2018) 

'I was written out of neighbours, it would take two weeks to travel from Australia to here, they'd have to write "Charlene goes to Brisbane or something".

'There was a period where I was doing them both and when that became too difficult, I left neighbours  to pursue music. I didn't know anything about song writing, barely knew anything about singing or performing.

'I was playing a character and doing what was asked of me. I was going to say doing as I was told but I think it was more doing what was required.'

Although Kylie admitted that she did grow 'furious' later in her career as she wanted to be more involved and would often be left in the waiting room.

She added: 'In the five years with them, going from a 19-year-old to early 20s, becoming furious, wanting to become more involved, be in the room, not be in the waiting room until they were ready.'

Recalling her experiences of being left in the waiting room, Kylie noted that it was 'just the way it was' but nowadays she would go into the studio any day as she loves it.   

Elsewhere in the interview, Kylie spoke about her partner, Paul Solomons, and said that they didn't spend the initial part of lockdown together but have since.

The star also admitted that she misses her family in Melbourne, Australia, as everything is so 'uncertain' at the minute with travelling due to the coronavirus crisis.  

Kylie is preparing to release her fifteenth studio album, Disco, in November.

Despite receiving some backlash from music critics in the past, many have hailed the star's latest single, Magic, as one of the best of her career.

The song is already off to a strong start on digital music charts in Australia and the UK, and has been racking up plenty of streams on Spotify, too. 

In May, the In Your Eyes hitmaker revealed that her hotly anticipated LP - her first since Golden in 2018 - was to feature a set of 'grown-up disco' tracks. 

She said: 'It's difficult even for me to explain. But even grown-ups need some pure pop fun.'
