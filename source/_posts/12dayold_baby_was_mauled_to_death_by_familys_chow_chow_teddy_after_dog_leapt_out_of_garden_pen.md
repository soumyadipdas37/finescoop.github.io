The dog who mauled a 12-day-old baby to death was a Chow Chow crossbreed named Teddy who attacked him after jumping his garden pen. 

Tiny newborn Elon was attacked on Sunday at his £100,000 home in the village of Woodlands, Doncaster.

The dog had been outside the property fenced in when it suddenly jumped free and set upon the small child. 

He was fought off and 999 crews called took him to hospital for treatment but despite doctors' best efforts he could not be saved.

His mother Abigail Ellis, 27, and her fiancé Stephen Joynes, 35, were later arrested by officers probing the tragic death.

Liverpool FC fan Joynes is the father of Elon, but not Ellis's older three children.

Both were detained on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter and have now been bailed, pending further inquiries.

The dog has been taken by South Yorkshire Police and it is believed it will be destroyed.

Ellis's brother Keith said Teddy jumped out of a pen in the garden that it was being kept in.

He said it was the third tragedy to beset Abigail in recent years, after she lost her dad and partner in the same house.

Mr Ellis said said: 'She has been through so much, she needs time to grieve.

'She has lost her dad, her partner and now her son in that house. 

'The dog wasn't in the house at the time, it was being kept in a pen in the garden.

'He was such a big fluffy dog, he was like a teddy bear. His name was even Teddy.

'You just wouldn't expect it to do anything like that. He's a big soft dog.'

'She always did her best by her other children and losing her partner hit her hard. 'It really affected her, they were so happy together and so close. It is such a tragedy.'
