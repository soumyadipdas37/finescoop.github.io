The TV personality, son of Caitlyn Jenner, showed off his impressive skills as he rode the Southern California waves while basking in the late summer sunshine. 

Brody's outing comes amid speculation he's in a romantic relationship with personal stylist Briana, who shares four-year-old son Freddie with One Direction star Louis. 

In June, it was reported Brody introduced Briana to his estranged wife Kaitlynn Carter after a month of dating – and the pair are said to have hit it off.

He was keen to seek his former flame's approval and the two women got on like a house on fire, TMZ reports, with Kaitlynn feeling he's found a 'good match' in Briana. 

'Brody and Kaitlynn are still very close, they are co-parenting dogs after all, and BJ really wanted Kaitlynn's approval on his new GF, which he got,' the website states. 

'Briana seemed cool with meeting a slice of Brody's past, and she totally understood the dog situation and the fact Brody and Kaitlynn will remain in the same circles.' 

Briana and Kaitlynn are said to have 'got along' and even discussed the former's young son Freddie, who Brody is believed to have met.

A source told TMZ that Kaitlynn feels her former husband has found a 'good match', adding: 'Kaitlynn felt Briana was very kind and with Brody for all the right reasons.' 

'Brody wanted to introduce Briana to Kaitlynn so she'd be comfortable with a situation that is anything but standard for exes,' TMZ's source added.   

Brody and Kaitlynn married in an intimate ceremony in Bali in 2018, but parted ways in 2019 after five years together. 

The couple's split was confirmed when Kaitlynn was pictured in an intimate clinch with singer Miley Cyrus, 27, while on holiday in Lake Como, Italy, last August.

Their surprise relationship also marked the end of Miley's 20-month marriage to Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, 30. 

The former couple are soon set to reunite on The Hills: New Beginnings, when production resumes later this summer.  

Brody and Kaitlynn have been spending some time together during quarantine to co-parent their dogs.
