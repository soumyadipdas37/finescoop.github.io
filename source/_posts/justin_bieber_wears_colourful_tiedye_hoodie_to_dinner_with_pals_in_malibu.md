He's days away from celebrating two years of marriage to his model wife Hailey, after they tied the knot during a romantic ceremony on September 30, 2018.

And Justin Bieber was spotted enjoying some time with pals on Friday night, as he stepped out for dinner at Malibu celebrity haunt Nobu.

The 26-year-old pop star was hard to miss as he emerged from the upscale eatery in a colourful tie-dye hoodie, while donning a protective face mask.

The Canadian-born superstar was seen chatting and laughing outside the restaurant as he waited for valets to return his car following his culinary outing.

Justin is just days away from hitting two years of marriage to Hailey, daughter of Hollywood actor Stephen Baldwin.

As their anniversary approaches, Hailey took to Instagram on Friday to reveal that she donned Kim Kardashian's SKIMS shapewear under her wedding dress.

The star shared a pair of posts from SKIMS on her Stories, which showed her in her breathtaking wedding gown, as the items she donned underneath were revealed.

While their official anniversary is set to fall on Wednesday, they enjoyed an informal picnic on September 13 to mark the day they got their marriage license in New York.

The Christian couple, who met at Justin's 2009 concert meet-and-greet, are now moving into their newly purchased a $25.8million mansion in tony Beverly Park.

Last Friday, Justin debuted the wholesome music video for his new song Holy featuring Chance The Rapper, which references his whirlwind romance with Hailey.

'Running to the altar like a track star / Can't wait another second / 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me / Feels so holy,' Bieber sang.

'They say we're too young and / The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin" / Wise men say fools rush in / But I don't know.'

The lovebirds briefly dated from December 2015 to January 2016, before calling it quits, then revived their romance in May 2018.

Once back together, things moved at a rapid pace between the pair, with their engagement announced two months later in July.

By November, it was confirmed that the photogenic twosome had quietly tied the knot in a romantic ceremony.
