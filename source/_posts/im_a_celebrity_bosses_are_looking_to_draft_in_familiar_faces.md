I'm A Celebrity producers are 'planning to draft in familiar faces' from previous shows to feature in one-off bushtucker trials to commemorate its 20th series.  

ITV bosses would welcome former contestants to take part in the challenges on the show which has relocated from Australia to Gwrych Castle in Wales amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Stand-out contestants who are reportedly in the running are Stacey Solomon, 30, who was crowned Queen of the Jungle in 2010, and radio DJ Tony Blackburn, 77, who became the first winner in 2002.

A source told The Sun: 'They’re using the fact they’re in the UK to their advantage and plan to draft in familiar faces to pop up in trials.' 

Other notable contestants who are reportedly in the frame are Scarlett Moffatt, 29, who won the show in 2016 and Phil Tufnell, 54, who was crowned King of the Jungle in 2003 - the same year he retired as a professional cricketer.  

MailOnline has contacted I'm A Celebrity representatives for comment.

It comes as I'm A Celebrity bosses have reportedly forked out millions to make the 19th-century castle where this year's series is being held in North Wales safe.

It has apparently been a costly affair to transform the castle into a TV set, as workers installed electrics and pipes to provide the location with running water. 

According to the Sun, the star-studded line-up of campmates will be housed under a waterproof roof in a show first to protect them from the bitter UK climate.   

Return? Scarlett Moffatt, 29, who won the show in 2016, is a possible contestant in the frame 

A show source said: 'This isn't a holiday camp for the stars, but without a roof, everyone would have been utterly miserable for three weeks, which would not make great telly.

'It will still be hard work but slightly warmer than if it snows where they are sleeping. ITV want viewers to largely recognise the show.' 

In pictures obtained by the publication, a studio where hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly has been erected, as well as an uncovered area where contestants will be allowed to light a camp fire. 

A section of the location where they will sleep has been covered with strong plastic to keep the winds and rain at bay.

MailOnline have contacted I'm A Celebrity for comment. 

Last month Kevin Lygo, the Director of Television at ITV, has revealed that all stars for this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! have been confirmed.  

And while rumours circulate that Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn, presenter Vernon Kay, and Coronation Street's Beverley Callard have signed up, Lygo assures all of the as-yet-unnamed stars have been confirmed – despite the change of location.
