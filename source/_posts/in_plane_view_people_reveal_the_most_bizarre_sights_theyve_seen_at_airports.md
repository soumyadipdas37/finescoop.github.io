Waiting patiently at an airport for a flight to depart may be boring for some, but others use it as a time to observe people's rather unusual quirks. 

Too Cool 2 Be True has compiled snaps of some of the funniest and most memorable moments travellers from across the globe have witnessed while preparing for their trips. 

Some of the amusing sights include a passenger wearing a bike helmet, a man practicing yoga in the departure lounge, and a woman who appears to be flashing her bottom - thanks to an unfortunately placed travel pillow. 

Elsewhere, an exhausted little girl can be seen flopped over the top of a suitcase, while being pulled along by her guardian.
