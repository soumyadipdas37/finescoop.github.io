New power couple Kaia Gerber and Jacob Elordi seem to be having the time of their lives in Los Cabos in Mexico this week.

The Vogue supermodel and the Kissing Booth actor were seen in their swimsuits as they continued to soak up the sun with her famous parents Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber by the swimming pool at an upscale resort.

The young duo have been inseparable since they kicked off their high-profile romance only a month ago in New York City. 

Happy together: Kaia Gerber and Jacob Elordi seem to be having the time of their lives in Los Cabos, Mexico this week

Keeping an eye on her new man: The cover girl looked down as her amour Jacob wore a cap by the side of the pool

Brunette bombshell Kaia was seen with her dark hair slicked back from a dip in the swimming pool as she added brown tinted sunglasses.  

The 19-year-old wore an attractive bikini that had a brown bandeau top with a ring in the front. The small briefs were low-ride and black with a thong back.

The Chanel catwalk queen also had a deep tan with bikini top lines on her chest from her top the day before. 

Jacob had on gray swim trunks that showed off his very toned physique and he was also seen with a blue towel around his waist.

Also on Jacob and Kaia's tropical Mexican getaway were her supermodel parents Crawford, 54, and Gerber, 58. 

This sighting comes just after Jacob congratulated his Euphoria co-star Zendaya on her Emmy win for her role on the hit series.

The 24-year-old actress (real name: Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman) became the youngest to win the Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series award for her portrayal of Rue in HBO's Euphoria.

She was also just the second Black woman to win in that category, following Viola Davis' win for playing Annalise Keating in How To Get Away With Murder, with Elordi, 23, taking to his Instagram story to honor her.

Elordi shared a photo of Zendaya with the caption 'Congratulations captain @zendaya' with a black heart emoji, followed by 'Bravo' and a purple heart emoji. 

Kaia and Jacob were first seen out to dinner together earlier this month at the upscale seaside sushi spot Nobu Malibu. 

A source told E! News at the time that their relationship was mostly platonic: 'Jacob definitely has interest in dating Kaia, but there is nothing serious going on there.

'They have many mutual friends and have hung out many times in the past. They both have very chill personalities and similar interests. Jacob makes Kaia laugh and her family adores him.'

The insider added: 'Kaia is keeping things friendly for now but there is flirtation between the two. She has told friends she is single and is only having fun and hanging out with people.'

Another source later told E! News: 'They've been inseparable for the last several weeks. They've been going out to dinner at night and working out together at the gym during the day.'

A little change: Gerber was also seen adjusting her small bikini top while on a lounger

Kaia split with Pete Davidson, 26, back in January, after three months of dating, and she later got matching foot tattoos with friend and 'solemate' Cara Delevingne, 28, over the summer, which sparked some rumors.

Meanwhile, Jacob is reportedly fresh off a relationship with Euphoria costar Zendaya, 24, after they began dating in February and later quarantined on opposite sides of the world. 

Last week Kaia and her mother Cindy were seen modeling Omega watches at a photo shoot done in the garage of the family home.
