Harry Derbidge causes trouble in Sunday's TOWIE after picking both his cousin Amy Childs and best friend Demi Sims as his maids of honour. 

The reality star, 26, is set to tie the knot with fiancé Dean Rowland, but trouble arises when he begins to plan his dream wedding with the pair and Georgia Kousoulou. 

In an teaser for the upcoming episode, Demi, 23, says: 'Basically, for Harry's wedding, me and Amy, are both maids of honours.

'So how's this going to work out, are me and you going to have to organise everything together or separately?'

Shocked by the revelation, Amy, 30, immediately vies for the Maid of honour top spot and plays down Demi's friendship with Harry. 

She responds: 'Right, listen, me and Demi maid of honours, lovely, happy, can't wait for it. But me and Harry, we're like best friends, we're cousins. I need to be head maid of honour, I think so.'

Oh no: The reality star, 26, is set to tie the knot with fiancé Dean Rowland, but trouble arises when he begins to plan his dream wedding but Demi wants to be chief bridesmaid

Demi interjects: 'I know you are Harry's cousin, but I am the one that set them up.'

Amy hits back: 'I know but I'm the one who has known Harry for 26 years.'

 Georgia looks on as the drama unfolds, before Harry quashes the argument: 'I think honestly, you've both got to work together for it.'

Congratulations! Harry and Dean became engaged in August last year, with Amy throwing them a lavish celebratory bash

On last Sunday's episode of TOWIE, Harry's ex-boyfriend Bobby Norris and Amy addressed their six-year feud which began when the make-up artist cheated on Bobby during their romance in 2014, and Amy decided to stand by her cousin.

The duo confronted each other over their long-running row on the reality show, and decided to lay their spat to rest after TOWIE original, Amy, made her return to the show.

Discussing their fall out, Bobby was keen to acknowledge that 'feud is quite a strong word' but that 'we didn't remain BFFs'.  

Speaking to Fubar host Stephen Leng about their dispute, Bobby said: 'There's kind of no ill feeling my side. It's great to have her back on the show.

He continued: 'I'm one of them people babe, I don't harbour grudges with anyone and it was never really our problem. 

'I would never hold it against her what happened between me and her cousin and vice versa.'

Cheers to moving on: Bobby Norris has revealed there is no bad blood between himself and Amy after they addressed their six-year feud on last Sunday's episode of TOWIE
