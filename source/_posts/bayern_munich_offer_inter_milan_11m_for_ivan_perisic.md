Bayern Munich have offered Inter Milan £11million for Ivan Perisic after he impressed at the Allianz Arena on loan this season.

The Bavarian giants previously moved for Perisic, spending £4.6m on his loan deal, after failing to seal transfers for top targets Callum Hudson-Odoi and Leroy Sane.  

The European champions now want to sign the 31-year-old permanently this summer but the Italian giants are likely to reject their offer as it is believed they are demanding at least £13m for the Croatia International.
