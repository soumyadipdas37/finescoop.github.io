Phoebe Burgess was enjoying the first week of spring on Tuesday. 

The 31-year-old shared a number of photos to Instagram in which she sat in the grass at her parents' sprawling Bowral estate. 

The former WAG absolutely glowed in a white, off-the-shoulder frock with romantic puffed sleeves and a floral print.

The blonde wore her hair down and straight around her face, on which she wore golden toned makeup with pink lipstick.

Phoebe went without accessories but for a chunky rose gold bangle worn on one wrist. 

The budding influencer was gleefully playing with a number of jars and tubes of body lotion which sat in a blue box.

Branches of pink flowers lay at her feet, and Phoebe looked absolutely gleeful as she relaxed on what was an idyllic day. 

She later traipsed around the garden, posing atop a stone fence among some green shrubbery as she brandished a hand cream. 

The former journalist captioned the promotional post in part: 'The world is just better in colour'.
