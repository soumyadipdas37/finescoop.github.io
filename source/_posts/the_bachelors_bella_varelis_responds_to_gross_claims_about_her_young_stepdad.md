Fans of The Bachelor couldn't resist fawning over runner-up Bella Varelis' handsome - and surprisingly young - stepfather during hometown visits last week.

And on Tuesday, the 25-year-old marketing consultant spoke about her stepdad, Dean, on the podcast Life Uncut.

Bella admitted she found it 'gross' that some viewers described Dean as a 'younger' and 'hotter' alternative to leading man Locky Gilbert. 

Speaking out: The Bachelor's Bella Varelis (pictured) has responded to 'gross' claims about her surprisingly young stepdad, who was featured on the show during hometown visits last week

'Oh my god, it's so gross,' she said.

'I saw a meme that was something like, "When Bella's stepdad is the hottest thing to walk in on the Bachelor 2020," and I was like, "Wow."'

Bella explained that Dean and her mother, Kim, who share a 13-year age gap, were 'blessed' to have found each other.

Awkward! Bella admitted she found it 'gross' that some viewers described her stepfather, Dean (pictured), as a 'younger' and 'hotter' alternative to leading man Locky Gilbert

Her comments come after fans flocked to Twitter following last week's hometown visits to share their thoughts on Dean's youthful looks. 

One viewer jokingly tweeted: 'Is Bella's stepdad legally allowed to drink wine at the dinner table?'

Others added: 'Bella's stepdad looks younger than Locky' and 'Sorry did they just say that was Bella's stepdad? Sis, he's younger than Locky.'

Smitten: Fans couldn't resist fawning over Bella's handsome stepdad during hometown visits. Several viewers even said he was better looking than leading man Locky Gilbert (pictured) 







'Most attractive': Bella's good-looking stepdad became a trending topic on Twitter last week

Another tweeted: 'The most attractive man to appear on The Bachelor is Bella's stepdad #TheBachelorAU.'

One viewer pointed out the difference between Bella's father, Steve, and her stepdad, tweeting: 'No wonder Bella's dad is a salty b*****d... look at who his wife remarried! The stepdad is the age of Bella!'

Despite Dean's unlikely heartthrob status, he seems to be quite private and doesn't post many photos on social media.

Jealous? One viewer pointed out the difference between Bella's father, Steve (right), and her stepdad (left), tweeting: 'No wonder Bella's dad is a salty b*****d - look who his wife remarried!' 

Youthful: Some fans incorrectly stated that Bella and her stepfather were the same age
