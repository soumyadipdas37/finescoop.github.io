She never fails to turn heads with her daring sense of style.

And Lauren Goodger cut a sultry figure as she enjoyed a night out at Jin Bo Law bar in London for her 34th birthday on Saturday.

The former TOWIE star ensured all eyes were on her as she donned a white blazer with a plunging neckline that displayed her ample assets.

Lauren also wore a matching pair of trousers for the evening and cinched her waist with a white belt.

The reality star added height to her frame with a pair of white heels while she also carried a matching handbag.

Lauren styled her brunette locks into an updo towards the end of the evening as she departed the venue with a group of pals.

The beauty shared a snap from the party to her Instagram and wrote: 'Making memories @jinbolaw_skybar my birthday with my best lot friends are family.'

It comes after the beautician enjoyed another fun night out in Manchester for her birthday on Thursday evening.

The reality star shared several updates to her Instagram where she sipped Champagne with her friends and even downed shots at Menagerie Restaurant and Bar.

Lauren has been in Manchester to brush up on her beautician skills at training centre Cosmetic Couture Clinic.

Earlier this month, the star revealed in New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame.

She explained: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.

'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me.

'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".'

The TV star claimed her mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father, who started his 'own life', from the age of four.
