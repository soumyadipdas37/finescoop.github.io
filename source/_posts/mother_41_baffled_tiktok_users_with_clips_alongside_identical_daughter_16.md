A youthful mother who baffled social media users by appearing in viral videos alongside her 'identical' teenage daughter has revealed that she started making clips before her teenager.

Stacie Smith, 41, from Georgia, stumped TikTok users after sharing various clips alongside her daughter Madison, 16, who many have said looks more like her twin than her child.

Appearing on This Morning today, the duo told that despite users telling them they look like 'twins', they still don't see a resemblance - while mother Stacie teased that her youthful appearance is 'all down to lighting'.

Host Eammon Holmes asked: 'Mum, it was you who started first wasn't it?' 

'She was on it before me,' replied Stacie. 'But we started doing videos on mine, with the two of us.' 

The presenter went on to ask: 'How do you look so fantastic Stacie?' 

'It's called lighting,' teased the mother. ' It tricks you, that's what it is.'

After being asked by host Eammon Holmes (pictured)  what the secret to her youthful appearance is, she teased: 'it's called lighting' 

In one clip, which has racked up over one million views, the nursery teacher and the teenager can be seen wearing matching outfits and dancing for the camera, while the caption read: 'Aren't you that mother/daughter duo that people think are twins? Since it's said so often, we went there. Still don't see it!'

'My friends think it's hilarious', said Madison. 'They love it, the most recent one had over million [views] and that's our biggest one yet. 

'We did that one because everyone keeps commenting on how much we look alike, we don't think we do, but apparently we do.' 

Stacey added: 'We were very surprised, typically when we do them together they get a fair amount of views, but this one blew up.'  

 The mother-daughter duo recently went viral with a clip dancing in matching striped sweaters and denim shorts

Many social media users said they'd been left stunned by the duo's likeness, with one commenting: 'To say that I was shocked in the resemblance is an understatement! Twins.'

The mother has filmed a series of clips with Madison and often challenges her 20,000 followers to tell them apart.

With their matching shoulder-length blond locks, big blue eyes and identical beaming smiles, it's not hard to see why the mother daughter duo often confuse viewers.  

And to add to confusion, Stacie regularly shares Tiktoks where she and her daughter dance together in identical outfits. 

And in a recent viral clip, the pair donned matching striped jumpers and denim shorts, leaving many commenters questioning who was the parent and who was the daughter.

One user commented: '3D printers have come a long way...'

Meanwhile, another added: 'God literally said, 'Copy and paste.''

Stacie insisted that despite what viewers say, she doesn't believe she looks like her daughter's twin (pictured, in another dancing video) 

Another person wrote: 'I've watched this 10 times trying to figure out which one was the mother. Had to come to the comments to find out.'

'Why did I think this was the reflection filter?' another commented.

One added:  'Wow. I was waiting for mom to wait in then saw she was there the whol time.'

Stacie responded to many comments on the now viral clip to say they 'made her day' before clarifying that she is the one on the left.

After one person jokingly asked if she had Madison 'when [she] was two', the mother replied: 'Bhaahha I'm dying! I had her when I was 25. I'm 41. She's 16.'







Social media users were left baffled by the clips, with many calling Stacie and Madison 'identical'
