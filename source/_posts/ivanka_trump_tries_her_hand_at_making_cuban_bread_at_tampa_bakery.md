Ivanka Trump rolled up her sleeves and tried her hand at making Cuban bread on Thursday while campaigning for her father in Tampa, Florida.   

For her latest trip, the 38-year-old White House senior adviser donned a light blue and white patterned dress with billowy sleeves and a matching Lele Sadoughi pinstriped face mask adorned with pearls. 

Ivanka's first stop in Tampa was La Segunda Bakery in Ybor City, where she met with the staff and helped roll out dough for the shop's famous Cuban bread.

Master baker Anthony Ali adjusted the first daughter's hands as he taught her how to properly roll a 36-inch loaf in the kitchen, where they both wore masks. At one point, she leaned over and pushed her elbow into the dough.  

Ivanka has faithfully donned a protective face covering for the majority of her public outings, despite her father's wavering stance on masks. 

She has also taken great care to match them to her outfits, with Thursday's look being no exception. 

During her visit, the former businesswoman also spoke with Stephanie and Copeland More, the owners of La Segunda Central Bakery

Next stop: Ivanka later joined former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi at Columbia Restaurant for a 'fireside chat' about small businesses

Jennifer Holton, a reporter for FOX13 News, tweeted that Ivanka had 'ordered three loaves of Cuban bread and guava pastries from La Segunda to bring back home to DC tonight.'   

Ivanka remained perfectly coiffed after her bread-making lesson, with not one blonde hair out of place when she headed to her next stop: Columbia Restaurant. 

President Donald Trump's eldest daughter joined former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi at the establishment, which is the oldest restaurant in the state. 

They sat down with other local leaders for an intimate 'fireside chat.'

Ivanka removed her mask for the conversation and sat slightly less than six feet apart from Bondi as they discussed the effect of COVID-19 on small businesses, among other things.

While Ivanka was in Florida, her stepmother, First Lady Melania Trump, traveled to New Hampshire, but she didn't do any campaigning.    

The 50-year-old's trip, which was to visit a Concord hospital, involved neither the presidential campaign nor the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.

She was there to visit a neonatal program for babies born addicted to drugs. Combating addiction is one of the three pillars of her Be Best campaign.

Meanwhile, Ivanka has spent the past few days traveling to key swing states as part of President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, making appearances at back-to-back events.

On Wednesday, she donned a $1,250 dress by Colombian fashion designer Johanna Ortiz to surprise volunteers at the Latinos for Trump headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. 

Ivanka was strategic when picking her outfit, opting to support a Latina designer while visiting the campaign group's headquarters, where she was photographed wearing a mask while speaking with volunteers. 

Her long blonde hair was center-parted and styled in loose waves, a departure from her typically poker-straight locks. 

While the lower half of Ivanka's face was hidden behind her mask, she had a twinkle in her eye as she walked around the headquarters with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.

She was photographed waving and speaking to volunteers, and at one point, she gave the woman she was talking to a fist bump.  

Ivanka also volunteered to work a phone bank at the headquarters and was seen using a cellphone to call someone.  

After her visit, she sat down with Gov. Ducey and others to participate in a roundtable discussion about America's working families. 

The first daughter later shared photos from her trip on Instagram, writing: 'Joined Governor @dougducey and many new friends for phone banking and great discussions today in Phoenix.

Busy bee: After she left Arizona, she flew to Austin, Texas, for another event 

All smiles: Ivanka took the stage for an intimate conversation at the fundraising event for her father's campaign 

'Heard incredible success stories from hardworking Arizonans — they credit @realdonaldtrump pro-growth economic policies. Arizonans know that POTUS will continue to fight hard for them for the next four years!!'

Ivanka's trip to Arizona marks the first time the first daughter has visited the state since her father was elected, but that wasn't her only visit for the day. 

After she left Arizona, she flew to Austin, Texas, where she participated in a fundraising event for her father's campaign.

She posted photos of herself sitting on stage at the gathering, writing: 'Great night in Austin shattering political fundraising records in the city - the excitement for @realDonaldTrump is “yuge”!‬ ‪

'Thank you to the Trump Victory team and @GOPChairwoman Ronna!'
