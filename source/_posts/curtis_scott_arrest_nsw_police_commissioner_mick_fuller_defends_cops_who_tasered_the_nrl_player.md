NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says he is 'sympathetic to police who turn up to deal with drunken idiots every night' after officers were slammed for tasering an NRL player who was sleeping off a boozy night out under a tree.

Canberra Raiders centre Curtis Scott, 22, was found asleep in Sydney's Moore Park following Australia Day celebrations on January 27.

Police body cam footage shows Scott crying out in agony after being pepper sprayed and tasered by police who tried to move him. 

One officer then tells Scott that being pepper sprayed is 'not that bad' and laughs.

Mr Fuller said on Tuesday that Scott was 'trespassing' and police were left in 'a very difficult situation' with two options - for the player to comply or 'to use force'.

'There were minutes and minutes where they were attempting to move him peacefully,' Mr Fuller said on 2GB's Ben Fordham Live.

'Whether or not they used their powers lawfully, I can't comment on that because it's still subject to court proceedings and oversight.

'But I am sympathetic to police who turn up to deal with drunken idiots every night.'

Host Ben Fordham asked: 'He was asleep, he was drunk so it was hard for him to comply. So, are you saying it's right for him to be tasered?' 

'What I'm saying is, I'm sympathetic to police who had to do something with him,' Mr Fuller replied.

'The other option is this — you put a baton under each of his arms, you squeeze it down and you put him in the back of the truck, now that is no less painful than being sprayed.'

Mr Fuller said police 'had to go hands on' to get Scott out of the public space. 

'We couldn't leave him there, because if we did and he went on and committed more crimes or he injured himself, the police are liable. He had to come with us,' he said. 

 Scott pleaded guilty to two counts of behaving in an offensive manner in a public place earlier this month. 

But prosecutors withdrew the two counts of assaulting a police officer, one of resisting an officer in execution of duty, one of behaving in an offensive manner and one of remaining on Trust lands after being requested to leave.  

'I'd never assault a police officer and that was probably the hardest thing, sitting on that for nine months - knowing you haven't done what they've said - and you've got the whole world coming down on your shoulders,' Scott previously told Seven News.

'Everybody on your back, making out that you're some monster, a cop basher. In the back of my mind, I knew if one of these charges stuck I'd be digging holes for the rest of my life.'

Scott's lawyer Sam Macedone said the NRL player had feared he may have jeopardised his future in the league following the arrest and also lost a Nike sponsorship deal. 

Mr Macedone said he and Scott would consider taking legal action against police after their case fell apart. 

The 22-year-old's legal team have also called for police to cover more than $100,000 in legal fees - with Magistrate Giles due to return a decision on the matter on September 25. 

Mr Fuller said NSW Police would comply with any directives if the officers' actions were found to be unlawful.  

'What transpired is tested on two things. One is, were the actions of police lawful? And secondly, do they withstand public scrutiny?' he said. 

'If what they did was lawful or wasn't lawful will be looked at by (police) oversight that have taken that matter and obviously, I'll respect whatever advice and guidance they give after their investigation.' 

Scott's lawyer Sam Macedone said he and Scott would consider taking legal action against police. Whether the officers' actions were unlawful remains to be seen
