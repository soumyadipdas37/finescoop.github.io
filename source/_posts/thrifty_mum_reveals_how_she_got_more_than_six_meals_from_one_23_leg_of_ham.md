A thrifty mum has revealed how she got more than six meals from a leg of ham, after she bought one for $23 and decided to challenge herself to see how much she could cook with it.

The Australian woman, called Amanda, posted on Facebook on Tuesday, where she  revealed exactly what she made with her $23.54 purchase from Coles - and how much she has saved by buying such a large amount.

'I thought I'd buy a whole leg of ham and see how far it got me,' she posted on Facebook. 

'It was $8 per kilo, 2.9 kilos, and cost $23.54 all up.'

The Australian woman, called Amanda, posted on Facebook on Tuesday, where she revealed exactly what she made with her $23.54 purchase from Coles - and how much she saved

Using the ham, Amanda said she got two cups of diced ham for two separate pasta bakes, one piece for a roast meal, one 'meaty bone' for a soup and 750 grams of sliced ham for sandwiches.

* Pasta bake x 2

* Roast meal

* Ham soup

* Sliced ham sandwiches

* Ham for dog food

* Ham pork crackling 

She also got a 'bagful of scraps to add to dog food' and used the skin to make pork crackling.

'I reckon it was definitely worth it,' she said. 

'$8 a kilogram is $20 cheaper than ham from the deli.'

Hundreds of people online who saw her post said they would try the approach for themselves.

'That is so good! I've not thought of doing this before. I would love to give it a go,' one person posted.

'Ham steaks are a fave here. Bulk meat and cut your own saves heaps,' another added.

A third said she did similar recently, spending around $13 on her ham with a $10 off card from Woolworths.

'We got around 15 meals from it, plus we used the bone for soup so that was another five meals,' she wrote.

'Great value for the price.' 

In the past, a mother-of-one from rural western Australia called Liz Stephenson shared her secrets for shopping on a budget, after revealing she spends just $50 a week on groceries

Liz swears by doing a meal plan for the month before she goes, as well as shopping from home before curating a menu and then bulk buying and freezing what she doesn't immediately use

* Shop monthly instead of weekly to avoid temptation.

* Do 'Click and Collect' to save you from having to go into the supermarket.

* Do a meal plan for the month.

* Shop your pantry before you go to the supermarket.

* Bulk buy and freeze what you don't use.

* Grow your own if you can, whether it's herbs, fruit or vegetables.

* Repeat meals throughout the month.

* Use leftovers for lunch or pre-prepare lunches for the week.

In the past, a mother-of-one from rural western Australia called Liz Stephenson shared her secrets for shopping on a budget.

Liz said she feeds herself, her husband and their 17-year-old son with a strict budget of $50 per week, as well as countless guests. 

She doesn't go to the supermarket very often because she lives 45km from the nearest Coles and Woolworths and there is no Aldi close by.

'I do Click and Collect so I don't step foot in to the supermarket, which means I don't make any impulse buys and can see the total before I check out,' she said.

Liz also swears by doing a meal plan for the month before she goes, as well as shopping from home before curating a menu and then bulk buying and freezing what she doesn't immediately use.

Alongside these more conventional shopping secrets, the mum-of-one said she does a few other things that save her family valuable money.

'We grow our own lamb, which is included in the twice-weekly meal plan (roasts, loin chops, diced four quarters and shanks) and also have a summer and winter vegetable garden and fruit trees,' Liz said.

During July, she is harvesting broccoli, snow peas, kale, spinach, carrots cabbage and also grows herbs including basil, parsley, oregano and rosemary.
