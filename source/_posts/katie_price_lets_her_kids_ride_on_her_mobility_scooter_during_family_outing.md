Katie Price was seen out and about on her mobility scooter on Tuesday with her kids Jett, seven, and Bunny, five, larking around beside her. 

The glamour model, 42, who is in recovery from recently breaking both her ankles, enjoyed the sunshine while allowing the tots to ride on the vehicle. 

The appearance comes after Katie hit back at wheelchair users who criticised her for voicing concerns over her boyfriend Carl Woods fancying her while she is in a wheelchair - as she hit back saying: 'I'm allowed to be insecure'.

Katie was opting for comfort for the outing as she donned a white tee and leggings and zipped along with her youngest kids, who she shares with Kieran Hayler.

The star is also mother to Harvey, 18, with ex Dwight Yorke, and Junior, 15, and Princess, 13, with former husband Peter Andre.

Katie has been dating Carl for a matter of months but has frequently professed her love for the hunk, who had a fleeting appearance on the ITV2 show. 

After voicing her concerns over the passion in their romance and her mobility issues, Katie has now revealed she has received backlash.

Making plans! The appearance comes after Katie hit back at wheelchair users who criticised her for voicing concerns over her boyfriend Carl Woods fancying her while she is in a wheelchair - as she hit back saying: 'I'm allowed to be insecure'

She told New! Magazine: 'I've had a lot of abuse from people in wheelchairs because I said I felt like Carl wouldn't fancy me in a wheelchair. 

'I'm not saying people who are in wheelchairs shouldn't be fancied. I'm saying, I'm in a new relationship and he met me how I was before so why should he fancy me like this? I'm allowed to feel insecure!'

Her chat comes after she was left 'horrified' after her 'mucky mansion' caught fire on Monday night - after a blaze caused by candles damaged the same property in 2018. 

The fire brigade were called to the  former glamour model's house in West Sussex after neighbours raised the alarm.

The side of the £1.3 million home appeared to go up in flames after a caretaker built a bonfire right next to the side of her property, reports The Sun.     

The mother-of-five is currently living in a rented £4,250 per month six-bedroom property in Surrey, just minutes away from ex-husband Peter Andre's home while her dilapidated 'mucky mansion' is renovated 

A source told the publication: 'Katie was horrified when she was called about the fire - apparently the caretaker built a huge fire right next to the house, and when it went up the side of the house was covered in flames.

'It was a huge fire - a neighbour called the fire brigade thinking the house was burning down. It was put out in the end but you could see the smoke billowing across the road. She says the house is cursed.'
