Administrators at Texas Tech University are investigating a student who posted a video of herself at a party boasting about having coronavirus. 

The Office of the Dean of Students and Student Conduct shared in a Sunday tweet that they were aware of the video and were addressing the matter. 

The video circulated across social media over the weekend, and showed an unidentified female bragging about her party life despite testing positive for COVID.

In the brief clip, the girl sits with friends and pans to show the party she's attending in what appears to be a yard. 

'Yes I have COVID, the whole f*****g world has COVID,' she asserts in the clip.

'All of these people have COVID. So stop getting on my tip, stop getting on my tip. Like, I'm having a good time.'

It is unknown whether the girl is a student at the university or whether others in attendance are affiliated.

There are 1020 total cases of coronavirus reported at the university as of September 8, according to a release from the school's Office of Communications and Marketing. Of those, 918 are students.

In a letter released on September 8, Texas Tech’s President Lawrence Schovanec said that the university had been met with a series of 'challenges' since resuming classes two weeks ago.   

'The first two weeks of classes have presented its share of challenges. Our plans have been tested, but I am very proud of your resilience and your focus on the well-being of our students,' Schovanec said in the release.

I know that further challenges await us as we continue to work through this pandemic. I am proud of our university community and the way you have supported one another. I deeply appreciate all that you are doing.
