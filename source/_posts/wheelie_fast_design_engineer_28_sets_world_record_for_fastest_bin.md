An inventor who broke the record for the world's fastest wheelie bin has delighted Good Morning Britain viewers after revealing he raised over £3,000 in tribute to his late friend. 

Andy Jennings, 28, from Swindon, on Sunday set the Guinness World Record for fastest wheelie bin, reaching speeds of 45.35mph - smashing his target of 30mph - in his homemade motorised bin.

The design engineer spent hundreds of hours building the motorised bin, in a bid to raise money for the care home which looked after his late friend Ben Ellis, who passed away during lockdown, after suffering brain damage from a blood clot in 2015.

Viewers quickly took to Twitter to call the idea 'very creative' and 'just brilliant', adding that Andy is raising money for a 'great cause'.

When quizzed on how it feels to be a world record holder, Andy said: 'It’s just sinking in, it’s pretty surreal, a pretty phenomenal feeling.'

'It created the world record, funnily enough nobody has done it before and I’m realising why.

'It started as a means to get funds for a good cause. I’ve always wanted a record and it wasn’t until I was flicking through the book everything had been done.'

Viewers quickly took to Twitter to praise the idea, with one writing: 'Just brilliant'.

One said: 'Very creative and for such a great cause. So sorry about your friend Andy, that’s really sad, but what a wonderful tribute to the exciting and fun person you described he was. I hope you raise a lot.'  

A third teased: 'How about trying to beat this record, or even better a wheelie big Grand Prix.'  

Jennings created the DIY vehicle over the past three months, doing it in his own time after work.

The 'Heath Robinson' device includes a standard wheelie bin, the rear axle of a go-kart, a 110cc four-speed pit bike engine, a bike seat, handle bars from a child's scooter and the seat post and steering from a mobility scooter.

Showing off the inside of his motorised wheelie bin, Andy revealed that his tiny petrol tank is actually made of a drinking flask, to the delight of hosts Piers and Susannah. 

Andy decided to try and beat the record in memory of his late friend Ben Ellis, who two years ago broke his leg in an accident at work, and was left comatose for two years when a blood clot formed in his brain. 

He was left permanently disabled and unable to speak or move after waking up from his coma, and Andy has raised over £3,000 to go towards his care home.  

'Ben is one of those genuine guys,' said Andy. 'He’s always been building wacky things on his farm. 

'Unfortunately, he had an accident broke his leg and it put him in a coma for two years, he was disabled for two years and sadly in lockdown passed away.

'So this whole thing was to raise money for his care home and the whole idea is to do what you can, when you can, because Ben certainly did.'

Speaking ahead of his record Sunday, Andy admitted that even is fiancée Emma was not sure about the idea initially. 

He said: 'A lot of my family and friends have been wondering what on earth I was doing it for, but now it's actually out there and working it's nice as I can see their reaction.

'Even my fiancée, Emma, was impressed when she saw it and I think it's fair to say she was a bit dubious beforehand.

'She's been really supportive but she did think it was a bit of a lunatic idea when I came up with it.'

Speaking of his late friend, Andy added: 'Ben's brother, Sam, showed him the videos of the first runout and he was crying tears of laughter.

'It's good to see he's supportive of it and it's exactly the sort of thing he used to do on his farm - he always used to make crazy things on his farm and that's what gave me the idea really.'
