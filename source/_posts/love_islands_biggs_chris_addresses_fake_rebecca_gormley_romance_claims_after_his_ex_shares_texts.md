Love Island's Biggs Chris has apologised to girlfriend Rebecca Gormley after his ex Lori Matthews shared messages where he appeared to call their relationship 'fake'.

The reality star, 27, took to his Instagram Stories on Tuesday night to address Lori's claims where Rebecca, 22, also insisted that she is 'not bothered' by it and 'everything is good' with the couple.  

Make-up artist Lori shared a TikTok video to her Instagram account, which has 37.1K followers, just hours earlier where she accused ex Biggs of leaving her for Rebecca after appearing on Love Island.

In the short footage, which was overlapped with La Roux's track Bulletproof, Lori exposed messages, which appeared to be from Biggs, where he called his relationship with Rebecca 'fake'.

Posing at the start of the video, she wrote: 'Think you can hurt my feelings? My ex convinced me to support him going on Love Island... then left me after to get with another islander.'

The clip then went to a picture of the former couple kissing as well as showing a grab from their own YouTube channel called 'Biggs & Lori'.

Lori then exposed the messages in the TikTok video, where Biggs said things such as his relationship with Rebecca will 'never proceed' and it's 'for the public'.

The messages started with Biggs heading to the villa for the winter edition of Love Island earlier this year where they discussed their future. 

Lori put: 'Mwahhhh love you loads and loads' and 'see you soon it'll fly in', to which he replied with: 'Babe am gonna smash it for us'  followed with a video of himself. 

She then showed more messages where he appeared to say: 'Honestly you have nothing nothing nothing to worry about,' and 'I swear and you should your freaking sleeping in my house.'

Yet the messages took a dramatic turn when Lori then shared texts from March where she said: 'Listen Biggs I stood by you. Not for you to be with her a year so answer me now I need a time frame?'

Biggs appeared to reply with: 'I have the best easiest ride' and 'Lori I'm telling you', to which she responded with: 'Why do you lie then! You said you were gonna cut it'.

With the messages adding: 'BUT the Rebecca thing will never proceed' and when Lori suggested they would be 'acting like a couple', Biggs replied: 'For the public duhhhhhh' and added 'do we see each other noo do we post pictures no.'

The messages end with Lori appearing to give Biggs an ultimatum, she says: 'End it with her and do ur own thing you got what you wanted? Were you lying when you said you wanted to cut it soon.'

To which he replied with: 'It's about my life and how this year I wanna grow am telling you me and Rebecca won't be a thing if you're not happy that this is fake.'

Biggs was quick to address Lori's video and claims as he issued a response to his Instagram Stories.

At first, he mimicked the make-up artist by giggling, he then added: 'Just want to address this madness, it's so sad it's happening now because I'm at my happiest. 

'Family has never seen me this happy. Even though I hate to admit it, I must say ok, I am the happiest I have ever been.'

He added: 'For this to creep up, my mum said she's not surprised this has happened, not surprised the negativity, when others see others being happy, they want to tear it down.'

Statement: Rebecca also addressed the claims and wrote on her Instagram Story: 'I am so grateful for everyone's messages, I love you all. Everything is good with me and Biggs, living in the moment not in the past.' 

Biggs insisted: 'We did not plan this, I always fancied you [Rebecca], never thought this would happen. I left the villa myself and she left with Jordan, to find each other outside the villa. You get me. Obviously, apologies.'

'I just wanted to say I'm sorry, you get me,' to which Rebecca, who was also in the video, added: 'I get it, like I'm not bothered. Obviously I appreciate your apology but I'm not bothered like.'

Biggs continued: 'I apologise to you for any mistake I've made tonight, I don't want to talk too much tonight, I could tell you guys some madness, I just wanted to apologise. You get me, keep it moving and good vibes.' 

Rebecca also addressed the claims and wrote on her Instagram Story: 'I am so grateful for everyone's messages, I love you all. Everything is good with me and Biggs, living in the moment not in the past.'

Happier times: It is not known how long Biggs and Lori dated but the Love Island star appears in one of her YouTube videos from August 2019

The couple went on to share loved-up snaps and videos of themselves during a train journey on Wednesday.  

MailOnline has contacted both Biggs and Rebecca's representatives for further comment. 

It is not known how long Biggs and Lori dated but the Love Island star appears in one of her YouTube videos from August 2019.

During the footage, Lori calls him her 'good friend' to which he jokes: 'Friend? Is that what you call it these days.'

With the make-up artist admitting she is waiting for him to ask her to be his girlfriend. 

Biggs and Rebecca have been inseparable since appearing on the winter edition of Love Island earlier this year.  

Rebecca had originally left the Love Island villa with Jordan Waobikeze, who she pursued in Casa Amor, but confessed shortly afterwards that she wanted to go on a date with Biggs.

Biggs had similarly failed to find true love in the villa after Jess Gale did not choose him during the recoupling.
