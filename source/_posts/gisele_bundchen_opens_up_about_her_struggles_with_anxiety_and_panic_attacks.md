Getting real: Gisele Bundchen went without the designer labels and glam makeup for a fresh faced photo posted to Instagram on Wednesday as she opened up about her struggles with anxiety 

'From my own experience I learned that nothing is permanent,' she wrote.  'Sometimes a gentle reminder that the bad feelings will eventually go away can work like a beacon of hope.'

The former Victoria's Secret model explained the consuming nature of anxiety and the help that a support system can bring. 

'Anxiety can feel all-consuming,' Bundchen added. 'And sometimes we need a supportive push to help break us out of our vicious cycle of worry.'

After dealing with he 'own panic attacks' that  'were difficult' she said 'I sought help.'

'In moments like these, family, friends and specialists can help,' the model said of her different support systems. 'And so can breathing and meditation tools.' 

She added: 'The most important thing is to move away from inertia and look for alternatives. Life is our greatest gift—and every day is worth it.'

This isn't the first time the supermodel has discussed her anxiety. 

Birthday boy: Earlier this year, the mother-of-three, who shares Benjamin, 10, and Vivian, seven with Tom Brady, said that ditching 'bad habits' including having a mocha frappuccino and four cigarettes in the morning helped reduce anxiety

Earlier this year, she told Vogue Australia that ditching a series of her 'bad habits' has helped her to keep her panic attacks and anxiety at bay.

Bundchen explained that she suffered with her mental health in her early 20s and has revealed that as well as a vigorous meditation routine - which has her up and stretching at 5.30am every day - she credits swapping out sugary foods, quitting smoking and exercising with reducing her anxiety levels.

'So when I stopped having coffee, the mocha frappuccino for breakfast and four cigarettes when I woke up in the morning, I started running,' she said. 

She also admitted she felt like 'she couldn't breathe' and was 'going to die' when she'd get the elevator before she started adapting her diet and lifestyle, and it was a huge 'shock' to her system when she made the changes, which resulted in the 'the worst headaches.'

'It feels like a prison': And back in 2018, she explained that pressure she faced to be 'perfect' caused anxiety and that using meditation helped her break the cycle (pictured in May 2018)

And back in 2018, she explained that pressure she faced to be 'perfect' caused anxiety and that using meditation helped her break the cycle. 

She said 'breaking the perceptions of being perfect' is the secret to a truly happy life.

Bundchen, who began modeling at 17-years-old told Australia's Today show that trying to maintain such high standards 24/7 can make you 'feel like you're in a prison.' 

'I think meditation was definitely one of the most important tools,' Gisele said, before adding that she also practiced 'specific breathing techniques'.
