Authorities in Arizona have arrested a 17-year-old boy suspected of opening fire on two troopers this morning, marking the third time that law enforcement officers have been attacked in the span of one week.

According to an official statement, two Arizona Department of Public Safety troopers were sitting in an unmarked vehicle near 37th Avenue and Portland Street in Phoenix at around 9am on Thursday when a silver-colored sedan pulled up and sounded the horn.

A passenger exited the vehicle brandishing an assault rifle and fired shots at the troopers, who returned fire, according to DPS.

Law enforcement officials on Thursday arrested a 17-year-old boy accused of shooting at two Arizona Department of Public Safety troopers in Phoenix 

The troopers were sitting in their unmarked vehicle Thursday morning when the teen armed with an assault rifle stepped out of a silver sedan and opened fire

The troopers were not injured in the attack, reported Azfamily.com.

Officers were able to apprehended the suspected gunman, who was described as a 17-year-old Hispanic male. The assault rifle used in the shooting was recovered at the scene.

DPS is searching for the getaway driver, who fled during the shooting. He was last seen operating a silver four-door Infiniti with custom wheels and a temporary license plate.

Anyone with information on the vehicle or the suspect is being asked to call 911 immediately.  

DPS is looking for the driver of this silver Infiniti. The vehicle sped off from the scene after the 17-year-old exited the vehicle from the passenger's side 

Thursday's attack on troopers in Arizona took place less than 48 hours after an unknown suspect fired three rounds at a moving patrol car in Suffolk, Virginia.

The officer escaped unharmed. As of this evening, no arrests have been made in that incident. 

Three days prior, two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were sitting in their vehicle outside the Compton Metro station when an armed suspect ran up to the cruiser and opened fire. 

Both deputies were struck in the head and torso by gunshots but are expected to survive. 

Less than 48 hours prior, a Suffolk, Virginia, police officer was shot at three times by a passing motorist  

On Saturday, a man approached a Los Angeles County sheriff's patrol vehicle and shot two deputies sitting inside (pictured) 

One of the officers, 31-year-old former librarian Claudia Apolinar, was able to render aid to her injured 24-year-old partner and radio in for help despite bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound to the jaw.  

A massive manhunt is under way for the gunman in that shooting. A $200,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest. 

The Compton shooting sparked outrage as bystanders were filmed mocking the bloodied officers at the scene.

Videos of ill-wishers railing against the wounded deputies enraged critics who said the shooting was the result of a groundswell of anti-police sentiment fueled by a turbulent summer of demonstrations against police brutality sparked by a series of shootings targeting Black men and women.
