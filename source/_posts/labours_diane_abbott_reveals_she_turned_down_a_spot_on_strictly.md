Labour's Diane Abbott has revealed she turned down a slot on Strictly Come Dancing because she does not have 'natural rhythm'.

The former shadow home secretary, 66, praised former Cabinet minister Jaqui Smith for taking the plunge and agreeing to appear on the hit show.

But the MP insisted she personally would never want to put her dancing skills to the test before a massive audience.

Asked on Sky News if she had been approached, Ms Abbott said: ‘They have and I turned them down. I couldn’t possibly do it.

Strictly Come Dancing is going ahead this year but with changes to account for the ongoing coronavirus crisis

‘You will be surprised to know I am not someone with natural rhythm. And I didn’t want it exposed to millions of television viewers.’

Former Home Secretary Ms Smith and YouTube star HRVY are among the contestants confirmed for the upcoming series of Strictly.

Ms Smith, 57, said: 'I was speechless with excitement at being asked to join Strictly – and that's very rare for me...

'Fifty years ago, I got a bronze medal for Scottish Highland Dancing and it feels about time to return to dancing.

'I couldn't be in better hands with the Strictly team and I'm going to throw myself into the challenge. Watch out!'.

Ms Smith and HRVY are joined on the final line-up by Jason Bell, Ranvir Singh, Clara Amfo, Caroline Quentin, Jamie Laing, Bill Bailey, JJ Chalmers, Max George, Maisie Smith and Nicola Adams.

Labour former minister Ed Balls is also among the politicians to have taken part in the show in recent years.
