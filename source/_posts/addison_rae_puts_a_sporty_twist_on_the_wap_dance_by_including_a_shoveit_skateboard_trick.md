Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's hit track WAP has inspired a viral dance craze that requires participants to knock out the rappers' music video choreography.

And Addison Rae put her own twist on the challenge by incorporating a shove-it skateboard trick into the routine, which was posted to Tik Tok on Tuesday. 

The 19-year-old Tik Tok sensation effortlessly busted out the suggestive moves and hopped onto the skateboard as pal David Dobrik filmed.

Though Addison was able to complete the challenging trick, she slightly wiped out at the end and the board slipped out from under her.

She played off the wipe out like a pro by bursting into laughter and facing David's camera head on. 

'Get you a girl who can do both,' captioned Dobrik, who boasts 22.5million followers on Tik Tok.

In the share-worthy, Addison donned a black oversized tee and a pair of grey cotton shorts.
