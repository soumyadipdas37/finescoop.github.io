The end of the UK government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme hasn't dampened Britons' taste for dining out, findings released today by Tripadvisor have revealed.

The travel platform found that in the first two weeks of September, the volume of UK users searching for places to eat was in line with 2019 levels of demand, in stark contrast to the lower levels of demand the restaurant sector had faced in the months preceding the introduction of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.

Comparing year-on-year traffic volumes on Tripadvisor, traffic to UK restaurant pages in the first two weeks of September dipped slightly compared to the August peak, when the Eat Out to Help Out discount was introduced by the government to help kick-start spending in the hospitality sector.

But it still gained 38 percentage points compared to the first two weeks of July and a whopping 67 percentage points compared to the first two weeks of June, says the travel website.

Martin Verdon-Roe, General Manager, Hospitality Solutions, Tripadvisor, said: 'The early signs are that Eat Out to Help Out may have had a lasting impact on diner confidence, with people returning to their favourite restaurants even after the government scheme ended.

'Some of that may be down to restaurants voluntarily extending the discount, but it is also likely a sign that once diners feel comfortable enough to take that first step back into a restaurant, they will keep coming back.'

The restaurant data was revealed in Tripadvisor's Seasonal Travel Index, which combines search data with consumer survey analysis to track accommodation and dining trends across the globe during the Covid-19 pandemic.

It found that globally, domestic travel for the autumn season (September 1 to November 30, 2020) continues to gradually recover, with nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) of all travellers planning domestic getaways during that period.

Tripadvisor says that outdoor adventures, which have gained popularity since the beginning of the pandemic, are continuing to interest travellers this autumn.

It adds that nearly half (44 per cent) of UK travellers are more likely to consider outdoor or nature trips and more than a third (35 per cent) are more likely to consider a road trip now, compared to before the pandemic.

It also found that retreats to countryside and seaside destinations are on the rise. 

And that British destinations are benefiting from a recovery in inbound tourism by international visitors (those visiting from outside the country).

Four British towns are among the 10 fastest-growing destinations in Europe for international tourists, with Bowness-on-Windermere second on the list, behind Belek in Turkey.

Scarborough takes eighth place, the Welsh town of Llandudno is ninth and Windermere is 10th.

Other European destinations in the top 10 are Marseille in France (third), Side in Turkey (fourth), Sochi in Russia (fifth), Adler in Russia (sixth) and the Irish town of Killarney (seventh).

Last-minute travel: Autumn travellers are booking more trips for the near future, often less than a week in advance.

Safety first: Across the globe, safety remains critical. More than two thirds (68 per cent) of global travellers say the safety and cleanliness of establishments are important when travelling locally and 63 per cent say they are more likely to consider a hotel's health and safety measures when deciding where to stay compared to before the pandemic.

Travellers are more budget conscious: Domestic travellers across the globe are searching for hotel stays less expensive than last year. While more travellers are viewing luxury resorts and romantic hotels, campgrounds and farmhouses are recovering the fastest year on year. In Europe, hotels that offer outdoor activities like hiking are also outpacing other property types in the recovery.

Accommodation style: While hotels make up the majority of interest due to size, bed & breakfasts have shown continuously stronger recovery year-over-year.
