A stray donkey made a right ass of itself when it needed rescuing by locals after it got its head stuck in a plastic chair in the United Arab Emirates.

Salem Al Kaabi, 43, spotted the struggling creature as he drove to his farm in Masfut, near Hatta, in Ajman.

He called some of his friends and family to help capture the stricken donkey before they managed to free it.

The chair is thought to have been left by a visitor to the area and it was digging into the animal's snout and neck, breaking the skin beneath it.

Mr Al Kaabi, who works with the police, used a handsaw to free the donkey before disinfecting its injuries and then setting it free.

He said: 'When the donkey saw us coming, she ran away and one of us followed her to the wadi and ‎managed to catch her and we all jumped in to help. ‎

‎'Seeing the donkey with a chair around her neck and face was unpleasant but it did not occur to me ‎that the chair would cause her severe injuries. 

‎'It wasn’t easy to take the chair out so we needed tools and more hands to keep the donkey still.'

 He added: 'I am familiar in dealing with animals as I raise livestock at my farm, so I asked one of the men to ‎go to the veterinary clinic and grab a disinfectant wound spray for animals.

‎'Our town is close to Hatta and many visitors come to the area during the weekend so I guess the ‎chair was left behind by them.

‎'Municipality workers work hard to keep the area clean and people should avoid leaving ‎rubbish behind.

‎'Littering can harm many wild animals in the area such as birds, wild goats and hedgehogs plus the ‎environment, which is totally unacceptable.'

 Mr Al Kaabi is now searching for the injured donkey, which he and ten people freed last Friday, after an animal rescue centre offered to to examine and treat it.

Manal Al Mansoori, founder and director of Yanni Animal Welfare, said they aimed to treat the donkey to Zabeel Veterinary Hospital.‎

‎She said: 'I saw the video of the rescue yesterday and immediately started searching for Mr Al Kaabi. ‎

‎'The donkey appeared to have deep injuries and needed medical assistance so I asked him to try ‎and locate the animal.‎

‎'She is probably hiding due to her pain and we need to find her before his condition becomes ‎worse.‎

The group freed the donkey which is now being sought so that it can be treated at Zabeel Veterinary Hospital

'Her treatment might cost between Dh7,000 to Dh8,000 and we are willing to cover it with the help of the ‎volunteers and the community, but we have to find her before she gets blood poisoning due to her ‎wounds.'

 Ms Al Mansoori has asked people not to leave litter which can cause injuries to animals.

She said: ‎'We receive many cases of stray cats with deep cuts due to the unsafe disposal of sharp objects ‎and old furniture. ‎

'Litter left behind after picnicking or camping can also harm the wildlife and environment ‎and everyone should be held accountable.'
