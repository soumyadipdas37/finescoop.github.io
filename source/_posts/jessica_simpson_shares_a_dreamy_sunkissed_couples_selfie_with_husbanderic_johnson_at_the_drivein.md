With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing, venues with built-in social distancing like the drive-in movie theater have experienced somewhat of a renaissance.

And Jessica Simpson enjoyed a 'dream date' night with her pro football player husband Eric Johnson at the drive-in, as seen on her Instagram page on Monday.

The Public Affair singer, who turned 40 last month, posted a beautiful couples selfie from the car, including a sunburst of light between her and Eric, also 40.

Jessica wore a teal top and large hoop earrings with her blond hair hanging down loose around her face.

She also had on a pair of round tortoiseshell sunglasses.  

And the Open Book author flashed her unmistakable smile with ultra-glossy lips. 

'Drive-thru Drive-in.....Dream date,' she captioned the sweet snap, along with a green heart emoji.

Eric, a former tight end for the San Francisco 49ers, flashed a smile of his own in a red baseball cap and grey T-shirt.

During a chat on SiriusXM's The Jess Cagle Show earlier this month, the singer and fashion designer opened up about her sobriety journey, after giving up alcohol in 2017, and how she's transformed her life by working tirelessly on self-improvement.

'I freaked out two months before I turned 40, not knowing that that age would even mean anything to me but then it's like 41, 42….' The mother-of-three said of turning 40 on July 10th.

'I've never calculated my age until now…. I am accepting it slowly' she said with a laugh.

On her birthday this year, Jessica marked turning the big 4-0 by fitting into a pair of True Religion jeans that she has owned for 14 years and snapped a mirror selfie to show they still fit.

'That was a really random thing, because I haven’t put jeans on through the whole time, I've been in sweats.

'I just think I am such a person that reminisces, I hold on to so many memories, I am tragically romantic like that about my own self….. Thank god I put a memoir out at 40 because if not it would have been 800 pages if I waited any longer.'

Simpson also reflected on the response to her hit memoir Open Book, published in January, in which she discusses quitting drinking three years ago.

'I did make a huge shift in my life…. I was at that point in my life where my kids were growing older and they were watching every move that I made. I just really wanted clarity. I wanted to understand myself cause I didn't even realize how much I was drinking and how much I was suppressing.

'I thought it was making me brave, I thought it was making me confident and it was actually the complete opposite, it was silencing me…. It's almost been three years which is crazy, I mean it’s pretty, its awesome.'

The star proudly revealed that she has not been tempted to drink during the pandemic and it's been a huge help that husband Eric stopped drinking too.

'People are like "don’t you want to drink during this pandemic, oh my god aren't your kids driving you crazy." I'm like no, I do not want to drink, like I have not wanted it, I feel like that's a big blessing. Once I surrendered and gave it over I never looked back and my husband did it with me so that support was amazing.'
