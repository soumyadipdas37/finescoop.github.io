She is currently acting as the Jury President for the 77th annual Venice Film Festival.

And Cate Blanchett was sure to turn heads when she received a leadership award from The Bellagraph Nova Group, Quinn Studios Entertainment and Terra di Siena International Film Festival in the Italian city on Friday.

The Carol star, 51, showed off her androgynous chic sense of style as she stepped out in a chic red jumpsuit that was cinched at her waist with a bow.

Cate's ensemble had a wrap-front design and she added a glittering touch to the look by wearing a gold chain necklace that was adorned with jewels. 

Her cropped golden locks were brushed into a sleek, straight design and she wore a light palette of make-up for the occasion. 

The Lord Of The Rings star boosted her statuesque figure in a pair of matching red heels, while she arrived at the venue with a face mask amid the coronavirus crisis.

It comes after Cate revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'. 

Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor. 

'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.'

Well deserved: Cate was given a leadership award at the event

 Cate is heading the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.

'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she added of her thoughts on the matter.

'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.' 

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It starts on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

According to Variety, when the Film Festival unveiled its official selection in late July, the 'unprecedented inclusion of eight female-directed titles within the 18-film roster was heralded as welcome progress for an event that has come under fire in recent years for scarce representation of female filmmakers.'

Cate was chosen to head the jury back in January, making her the third woman in four years to hold the role.
