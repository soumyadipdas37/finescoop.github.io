Justice League star Ray Fisher aired his grievances against director Joss Whedon back in July, accusing him of 'abusive and unprofessional' behavior.

And the Cyborg actor has been accused of not cooperating with an independent third party misconduct investigator, who was hired by Warner Bros. at his request.

He posted his rebuttal Saturday to Twitter, arguing that he did in fact cooperate with the investigator, but needed to consult his team before continuing their conversation.

The 32-year-old wrote on Twitter: 'Thank you all for the support and for seeing through @wbpictures desperate and scattershot attempt to discredit me to continue protecting those in power.

'I met with the investigator via Zoom on Aug 26th. Below is an email I sent to my team and @sagaftra immediately after.'

He included an email from August 26, in which he recounted there being another person they 'weren't aware of' on the call as a witness, as the investigator tried to keep him on the line, instead of letting him consult his team.

Fisher followed up the tweet, writing: 'It’s also worth noting that I made it clear to the world on Aug 21st that I would be vetting the investigator to ensure a fair and protected process for all witnesses.

Follow the money: He included an Instagram Live video from August 21, in which he said: 'At the end of the day, those people are being paid by somebody, and finding out who's paying them and how all that stuff is being sorted out is extremely important'

Fighting the good fight: He concluded: 'Your boy is gonna keep trying to fight the good fight. And as I've said in the past, if this is the only thing I'm blessed to do, if this impacts my career negatively in any way, I'm glad I was able to stand up for what I believe in'

'@wbpictures has escalated this to an entirely different level, but I’m ready to meet the challenge.'

It included an Instagram Live video from August 21, in which he said: 'At the end of the day, those people are being paid by somebody, and finding out who's paying them and how all that stuff is being sorted out is extremely important.

'So, you've got to do your due diligence, you've got to fact check, and you can't just take those things on face value.'

It comes after Warner Bros. released a statement Friday: 'This investigator has attempted multiple times to meet with Mr. Fisher to discuss his concerns but, to date, Mr. Fisher has declined to speak to the investigator.

'Warner Bros. remains committed to accountability and to the well-being of every cast and crew member on each of its productions. It also remains committed to investigating any specific and credible allegation of misconduct, which thus far Mr. Fisher has failed to provide.'

The statement was released just hours after Fisher took to Twitter with an update for his 63.7K followers. 

He wrote: 'So you can better understand how deep this goes: After speaking out about Justice League, I received a phone call from the President of DC Films wherein he attempted to throw Joss Whedon and Jon Berg under the bus in hopes that I would relent on Geoff Johns. I will not. A>E'

Fisher first raised concerns over Whedon on June 29, posting a video to Twitter of himself previously singing the director's praises, writing: 'I’d like to take a moment to forcefully retract every bit of this statement.'

Unacceptable behavior: Fisher previously tweeted in July: 'Joss Wheadon’s on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable' (pictured in November, 2017)

Whedon stepped in to finish the superhero film in 2016, after director Zack Snyder was called away over a family emergency. 

Fisher followed it up on July 1, tweeting: 'Joss Wheadon’s on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable. He was enabled, in many ways, by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg. Accountability>Entertainment' 

The Baltimore-born actor revealed last month on Twitter that the studio had launched an independent investigation after 'five weeks of interviews' with cast and crew.  

He starred as Cyborg in 2016's film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, as well as the 2017 followup Justice League, and he's contracted to appear in future titles, including a solo Cyborg film.

Meanwhile, Snyder's much-hyped cut of Justice League will premiere some time in 2021 on the new streaming service HBO Max.
