A simple Coke bottle is helping Australians save thousands of dollars in time for the holiday season.

Social media users are taking part in the 'Coke Bottle Challenge' as part of efforts to boost their savings. 

The challenge involves using different sized coke bottles as piggy banks, which can save users as much as $3,000.

The challenge involves using different sized coke bottles as piggy banks, which can save users as much as $3,000 

Instead of throwing in any loose change, the hack is centred around using $2 coins to maximise savings opportunities. 

Images show a 600ml bottle full of coins can save as much as $1,000.

While a 1.25L bottle can hold $1,000 and a 2L bottle just under $3,000.

But the trick relies on users filling the bottle all the way to the top.

The hack is being used by a number of crafty Australians to get ahead of the expensive holiday season, reported 7 News. 

'I'm doing one for Christmas and have already filled half a 2L bottle in a month or two,' one wrote.

'Love this for Christmas money, starting today,' another said.
