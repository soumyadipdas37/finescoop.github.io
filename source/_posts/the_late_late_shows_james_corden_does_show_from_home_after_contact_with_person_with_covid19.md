James Corden did The Late Late Show from quarantine on Monday after coming into contact with person who tested positive for the coronavirus.

'Today I was told that I’d come into contact with someone who recently tested positive for COVID-19,' the 42-year-old host said on his show. 'I’ve taken the test, that test has come back negative. 

'Out of abundance of caution for everyone who works on the show, I’m going to host the show over Zoom way more than six feet apart from anyone but my face will still be here, in the studio.'

The U.K.-born funnyman had his presence on set via a TV that was placed on a desk in his Los Angeles-based studio.

Insiders told Deadline that the person who the TV shot crossed paths with was not involved with his CBS show.

'And it’s a shame, because I thought like we were really getting into a rhythm in the studio,' said Corden, whose crew and band remained working from the studio. 'But the show must go on, and we are here and we are so happy that you’re watching.'

He joked with one of his staff, 'I think there's a very real chance by the end of this week you'll just be hosting the show.'

Corden's show returned to his studio on August 11 after months out of the Television City studio in the wake of the shutdown this past March.

Prior to this week, Corden was one in a number of late night hosts - including Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon - to resume production of their shows from their studios, with scaled down audiences or none present.

Other shows, including Jimmy Kimmel Live and Saturday Night Live, are slated to return into studios. 

Relieving: Corden himself has tested negative for coronavirus, and continues to practice proper protocols
