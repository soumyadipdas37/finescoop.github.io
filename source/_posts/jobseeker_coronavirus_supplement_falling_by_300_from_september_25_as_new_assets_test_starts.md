Australia's 1.45million JobSeeker recipients are having their unemployment benefits slashed by $300 from tomorrow.

The coronavirus supplement is being diluted from $550 a fortnight to $250 from September 25.

This will see JobSeeker payments fall from $1,115.70 to $815.70, following a temporary doubling of unemployment benefits for six months.

Those on the dole will also face a new liquid assets test waiting period if they have more than $5,500 in the bank.
