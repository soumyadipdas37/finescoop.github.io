The 36-year-old will bring a wealth of experience to Bilic's side, who will be aiming for Premier League survival. 

He told the official club website: ' The Premier League is the best league in the world.

'I need to challenge myself and I am ready for the challenge. I am really happy to be back playing in the Premier League. I hope I am going to be successful here.

'I have a lot of ambition and I want to prove a lot of things. I will give everything for the team.'

The defender is a Chelsea legend and won three Premier League titles with the Blues

Bilic added: 'He's a great addition for us, a team who are newly promoted in the Premier League. He ticks all the boxes for us.

'He's done everything in his career - it's been magnificent. We're delighted. He adds quality and experience on the pitch and off the pitch.

'So it is not only him, it is him plus the influence he will have on not just defenders but the whole team around him. That's why we targeted him as one of our prime targets. It's a great signing for us.'
