Max George shared his final night with girlfriend Stacey Giggs on Wednesday, as he prepares to quarantine ahead of Strictly Come Dancing rehearsals. 

The Wanted singer, 32, took to Instagram to share a sweet black and white snap holding hands in bed with the former WAG, 38, to say goodbye. 

Max will be separated from Stacey while filming the show, as the BBC have put strict measures in the place to reduce the risk of coronavirus among the cast and crew.

Alongside the photo, Max wrote: 'Last night with my ❤️ for a while.'

The post comes after a source close to Stacey told new! magazine that she and Max are not worried about the infamous Strictly curse. 

The source said: 'They're very solid. He's totally smitten with her. Everyone goes on about the Strictly curse, but she's not worried at all.

'They trust each other totally. They've got a very good, strong relationship and she's very supportive of him.

'It was her idea. She told him, 'This could be great for you.' She's so supportive of Max. Behind every successful man there's a strong woman and Stacey is that. She wanted him to do this.'  

MailOnline contacted Max's representatives for comment at the time. 

Back in July, Max told how he hoped to marry Stacey, who is the ex wife of footballer Ryan Giggs, one day and have children.

He told The Sun: 'I've always said I've wanted kids but never committed to it in my own head but I think Stacey's the one. 

'We would love to add to the family at some point, that would be amazing. Obviously there are no guarantees but I'm sure we both feel the same way.'

The couple recently enjoyed a holiday to Spain where they were joined by Stacey's children Liberty, 17, and Zach, 13. 

Back in March, it was reported Stacey was shopping for a new £1.5million house with Max, following one year of dating, after putting the £3.5million pad she shared with her ex Ryan up for sale.

Stacey reportedly invited The Wanted singer to move in with her at her Worsley home, near Manchester back in October, after seven months together.
