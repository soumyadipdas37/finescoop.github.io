Ivanka Trump traveled to Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday to highlight the Trump administration's efforts to combat human trafficking, after spending the weekend celebrating Rosh Hashanah in New Jersey with her family. 

The 38-year-old White House senior adviser's first stop in Atlanta was the Georgia Center for Child Advocacy, where she joined Attorney General Bill Bar and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on a walking tour of the facility 

Ivanka looked ready for fall in a navy blouse that she wore tucked into a pale blue pleated midi skirt and a pair of tan suede pumps.

She topped off the demure look with a blue floral mask that matched both her blouse and skirt. 

Ivanka has faithfully donned a protective face covering for the majority of her public outings, despite her father's wavering stance on masks. 

She has also taken great care to choose ones that compliment her outfits, with Monday's look being no exception.   

President Donald Trump's eldest daughter wore her blonde locks down around her shoulders and flat-ironed straight after getting her hair done at two different New York City salons on Friday. 

While visiting the Georgia Center for Child Advocacy, Ivanka learned more about the facility's 'Envision Project,' which offers intensive case management and educational support, employment readiness, life skills, and personal development programming to survivors of trafficking.

The group later headed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, where they held a roundtable with law enforcement, service providers, and private sector partners to discuss having public-private partnerships to help fight human trafficking.

At the event, Attorney General Barr and Ivanka announced the U.S. Department of Justice's grant funding aimed at ending human trafficking. 

The grant includes money for task forces to prosecute traffickers as well as services for trafficking survivors.  



'The Trump administration continues to fight tirelessly to end the scourge of human trafficking in our communities,' Ivanka said in a statement ahead of the visit. 'The leaders and community members we’re meeting with in Atlanta are on the front lines of this fight and are critical to our efforts to end this horrific crime. 

'I look forward to learning more about the critical services they provide and announcing additional funding and resources from the Trump administration to assist in these efforts.'

It's been an eventful few days for Ivanka, who traveled to New York City last Thursday and spent the weekend in the tri-state area. The trip marked the first time she had been photographed in New York since the pandemic hit the U.S. earlier this year.

The mother of three cut a casual figure as she made the short walk from her SUV to the front door of her New York apartment building on Thursday evening, dressed down in dark skinny jeans and a light gray sweatshirt — a far cry from the dressed-up, polished looks she typically sports in Washington, D.C.

A fresh-faced, makeup-free Ivanka was spotted again Friday morning as she dropped her son Joseph off at his grandparents' home. 

While on her own, she spent several hours getting her hair done at both Oon Arvelo Salon and later Oscar Blandi, before climbing back in her SUV to drive out to New Jersey to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. 

Ivanka, who converted to Judaism in 2009 to marry her husband Jared Kushner, owns a home in New Jersey, as do Jared's parents, Charles and Seryl Kushner.

Rosh Hashanah began at sundown on Friday and ended at sundown on Sunday, heralding in the new year of 5781. 

Ivanka and Jared, 39, were in New Jersey with their three children: Arabella, nine, Joseph, six, and Theodore, four. 

On Sunday, family was seen returning to his parent's opulent home in Long Branch, New Jersey, after attending an open-air religious service.

Ivanka donned all black as she escorted her children into the home. Her overcoat flowed in the cool breeze as she walked beside her daughter, Arabella, and one of her two young sons into the grand front doors.

Jared was briefly seen wearing a similar dark overcoat and what appeared to be a kippah, or yarmulke.

Charles and Seryl's youngest son, Joshua Kushner, and his model wife, Karlie Kloss, were also photographed at the home.

Later in the day, Ivanka and Jared joined their children for a game of beachside football while continuing their Rosh Hashanah celebrations. 

Photos taken by DailyMail.com showed Jared and Ivanka both decked out in workout gear as they toss the football with their youngest son, Theodore.  

Theo sported a white ball cap similar to his father as they both sprinted across the sand barefoot for Ivanka's pass. The adorable boy gave his Ivanka a high-five and hugged the football to his chest while playing with his parents.

Other photos showed Jared playing a game of toss-up with Theodore and the couple's eldest son, Joseph.

The family was spotted frolicking together along the shoreline and using toy shovels to scoop up sand. 

Ivanka also spent time exploring with her daughter, Arabella. Arabella gave Jared a high-five and was seen with Jared's parents, Charles and Seryl.

Seryl, who had on sunglasses and sweatpants, appeared to have brought along the family dog as Charles played with their grandchildren.
