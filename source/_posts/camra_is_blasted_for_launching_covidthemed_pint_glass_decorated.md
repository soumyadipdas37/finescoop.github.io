The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has been blasted for the 'tasteless and insensitive' Covid-themed pint glass for its 2020 beer festival glasses.  

The limited-edition pint glasses have been printed with images of white virus microbes - a move that has been slammed as  'tasteless ' and ' insensitive '.

Hundreds of Twitter users and CAMRA members took to social media to lament their disgust at the company's poor decision.

CAMRA has been blasted for this 'tasteless and insensitive' Covid-themed pint glass for its 2020 beer festival glasses.

The design has been released in support of this year's Great British Beer Festival, which has gone virtual for its 2020 edition and is due to take place next weekend.

Hundreds of people have criticised the move, with many saying they would cancel their CAMRA memberships because of it. 

Absolute disgrace: Twitter users say that CAMRA were clearly not thinking straight when they come up with the idea

Twitter user @WithintheWalls was outraged that the company was seen to be celebrating 41,449 deaths with the Corona virus branded glasses adding 'What utter disrespect?'

Another Twitter user @ashleymeerkat was in such disbelief she queried whether the designer was already 'drunk' when coming up with the idea.

Are you seeing double? This was the design chosen for this year's Great British Beer Festival

Hundreds of social media users took to Twitter to show their disgust at CAMRA's decision to launch the pint glass

The Twitter user @Jesslionmane said: 'Uh...Well here's a short sighted promotion. Shame on you CAMRA, I suspect you will lose a lot of respect over this!'

In total disbelief at how such a design got through all the people behind the decision-making process

Meanwhile Twitter user @Gary_Anderson said he couldn't believe the glass design had ever been 'approved' stating: 'I know it's 'only a glass' but how the entire chain of personnel involved in the design, commissioning, approving and manufacture of this glass all agreed that this was a good idea is unbelievable'

This is not the first time CAMRA has come under fire for its poor decision making and social media users made sure they were reminded

Following the backlash, CAMRA has posted a public apology and statement.

Festival organiser Catherine Tonry said: 'As someone who has suffered lasting lung damage after contracting COVID-19, I am all too aware how serious the illness can be and the devastating and long-term impact it has had on so many of us.

Hundreds of Twitter users aired their disgust at CAMRA's decision to launch the glasses which they say were in poor taste

'I sincerely apologise to anyone who has taken offence to the glass theme.

'We choose a theme every year and wanted to ensure the design recognised what was at the front of everyone's mind.

Total disgrace: CAMRA officials have apologised for their insensitive decision but Twitter users are sickened

'COVID-19 has been the defining event of 2020, and has severely impacted the beer and pub sector - as well as many of our personal lives.

'In fact, this is the first time we have held the festival digitally in over 40 years of hosting the Great British Beer Festival.

'We hope that despite the difficulties faced by many, the festival will give people the chance to come together over a pint and discover new brewers and cider producers to support throughout this period of uncertainty.'
