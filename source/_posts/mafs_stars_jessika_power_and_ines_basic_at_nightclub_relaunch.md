Jessika Power and Ines Basic became household names after starring on the 2019 season of Married At First Sight.   

And the influencers looked to have had a lot to catch up on, as they reunited for the relaunch of the Bedroom Nightclub at White Rino, on the Gold Coast on Friday. 

Jessika, 27, showed off her cleavage and trim figure in a pale blue frock, which she teamed with perspex heels.

The blonde beauty's cropped locks were styled straight, and her makeup included bold brows, false lashes, kohl-lined eyes and a natural colour on her plump pout.

Jessika warmly embraced Ines, 30, who revealed her toned tummy in a white crop top and coordinating relaxed-fit jeans. 

The former legal secretary boosted her height with black pointy-toe heels, and added a pop of colour in the form of a red shoulder bag.
