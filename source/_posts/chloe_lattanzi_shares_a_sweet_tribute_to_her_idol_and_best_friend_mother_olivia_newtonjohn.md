And on Sunday, Chloe Lattanzi, 34, took to social media to share a sweet tribute to her 'best friend and idol' mother as she celebrated her 72nd birthday.

Sharing a photo of her posing between the Grease star and her godmother Nancy Chuda, Chloe stunned in an aqua coloured mini dress.

Chloe looked primped with a full face of makeup and blowdried hair.  

Meanwhile, Olivia looked every inch the age-defying birthday girl in a white printed T-shirt and jeans.

'Mama and god mama ❤️❤️ happy bday! I'm stuffed with vegan cake right now and can't breathe. I'm a lucky girl', Chloe wrote underneath a photo.

Tribute: 'You are my best friend and I feel so grateful that I get to have you all to myself for your bday!' wrote Chloe in a separate post, gushing about her mother

The trio marked the occasion by nature watching at Olivia's California residence. 

In a seperate post shared to Chloe's Instagram, the blonde stunner gushed: 'You are my best friend and I feel so grateful that I get to have you all to myself for your bday!' 

'You are my idol mama. My rock and my giggle buddy. Happy birthday gorgeous!! This is the first of many bday posts!' she continued.

Last month, Chloe was finally reunited with her mother after spending more than three months apart.

Due to coronavirus restrictions, the Oregon-based socialite had been forced to stay away from Olivia, who lives in California.

In an emotional video shared to Instagram, the mother-daughter duo ran towards each other as they gave each other a 'safe hug'.  

'Finally reunited and it feels so good,' Chloe captioned the video, which she had also edited with a pink heart filter.

Her mother responded in the comments section: 'Soooo Happy (and safe!) mumma daughter hugs!!!
