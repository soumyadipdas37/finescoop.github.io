They shot to fame while showcasing their sizzling frames on Love Island. 

And Kady McDermott and Hayley Hughes proved they are still experts in stripping off as they flaunted their incredible figures in a shoot for Nikki Intimates lingerie. 

The St Albans native, 25, who starred on the 2016 series, and the Liverpudlian stunner, 24, who found fame on the show in 2018, were looking sensational in a series of extremely racy looks from the underwear brand. 

Oh my: Kady McDermott (pictured) and Hayley Hughes proved they are still experts in stripping off as they flaunted their incredible figures in a shoot for Nikki Intimates lingerie

Kady, who recently celebrated her 25th birthday in style, by treating herself to a luxury spa break in the Scottish Highlands, sent temperatures soaring. 

Slipping into a lacy red two piece with a matching suspender belt, the brunette beauty pulled her most intense gaze into the camera. 

She then headed to a mirror to touch up her make-up while still sizzling in lingerie.  

Hayley meanwhile was coiffured to perfection as she flashed every inch of her phenomenal curves - complete with taut abs and perky cleavage.

Oh wow! She also opted for a clashing look with a light blue set paired with black stockings

Kady recently left fans confused after she announced she is still with boyfriend Myles Barnett and they will live in their new home 'as a couple', weeks after confirming yet another 'break-up'.

The brunette previously took to social media to confirm she will be living in her renovated bungalow with former TOWIE star Myles, 26, when it is finished.

The duo bought a Hertfordshire property together in April 2019 with plans to completely transform it into a two-storey house.

Lady in red! Hayley looked phenomenal in a red set which flaunted all her best bits

Feeling sleepy? Hayley also sported a racy silk ensemble which made the most of her lithe limbs

She blamed their split on the pressure of the build which caused them to argue, as she joked that their renovation has been more stressful than having a baby. 

She wrote: 'Just to stop all the personal dms because we are literally get one every single minute, which is understandable.

'Me and Myles are will both be living in this house as a couple, couples do argue. It is a very exciting time for us both but also ridiculously stressful.

'Me and Myles can't wait to live in our forever home and will continue to share our journey with you. Now I understand when people say renovating/moving home is more stressful than having a baby.' (sic)

Woah! Lady made the most of her peachy posterior in one of the thong sets 

Hot stuff: Fellow Love Island star Natalia Zoppa was also on hand 

Steamy: Natalia starred in the inaugural winter Love Island, which aired earlier this year
