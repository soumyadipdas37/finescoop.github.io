This seek-and-find puzzle is far more difficult than it looks at first glance. 

Viral cartoonist Gergely Dudas, from Hungary, better known as Dudolf, challenged his fans to count the number of bees in this vibrant field of flowers. 

The puzzle was shared on his popular website this week. 

The task seems simple enough but almost everyone who tried the challenge was surprised to learn just how many bees there are tucked away between the petals.

The trick is to divide the image into sections and work through them methodically so you don't skip over any bees. 

To make things extra difficult, Dudolf has partially hidden some of the bees and has given others playful facial expression as a distraction technique. 

For an extra layer of fun, you can take a guess at how many bees there are before you start counting.
