Helen Flanagan has revealed she been suffering from severe morning sickness, after announcing she is pregnant with her third child.

The actress, 30, took to Instagram on Tuesday to reveal she is 'so relieved' to be over the worst of hyperemis gravidum, which causes excessive nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

Helen discussed her extreme morning sickness as she shared a sweet picture of her daughter Matilda, five, holding up a 'I hope you feel better' card as well as an ultrasound snap from her hospital bed.

She wrote: 'I've been a lot quieter on my social recently as I've had hyperemis gravidum. 

'I had this with both girls but this time was on another level. I am so relieved to be over the worst and so very happy and so grateful for my baby. 

'My mum has just been the best and I have no idea how I would have got through it without her! Scott's been amazing with the girls and the nurses at the Royal Bolton Hospital were so lovely which I'm so grateful for.

Pregnancy: 'I had this with both girls but this time was on another level. I am so relieved to be over the worst and so very happy and so grateful for my baby', she said

'I just can't wait to meet my little one so in love with them already. I'm going to film an IGTV on hyperemis soon and any other mummy's to be with hyperemis I feel you' (sic).

Helen revealed she was pregnant with the third child on Instagram on Monday night, sharing sweet family photos while showing off her bump.

The former soap star is already mum to daughters Matilda and Delilah, two, with her footballer fiancé Scott Sinclair, 31.

Helen looked gorgeous in a tight black jumper showing off her bump teamed with ruby red lipstick as she happily posed with Scott and their daughters in their kitchen. 

She captioned the post: 'Our 3rd baby arriving March 2021 @scotty__sinclair'.  

Helen and Preston player Scott have been in a relationship since 2009 and got engaged in May 2018.

The couple had originally planned to marry this year, with Helen previously revealing she'd even found her dream dress, but the actress explained in February they had decided to postpone as her younger sister was due to wed in 2020. 

Speaking exclusively to the MailOnline after her engagement, Helen gushed about motherhood, declaring it to be her most fulfilling role.

The soap star enthused: 'I always wanted to have a baby, that's what I've always wanted. I think it's just made me a lot happier, and gives you perspective and helps you rationalise what's important. I think it gives you a real purpose.

'I feel like my girls make me feel like I can do anything. I love being a mum, I love everything of it. Sometimes I'm like 'this is going to be really difficult' because I'm tired or whatever, but it is amazing as well and I really enjoy it. 

She also said she would love to have two more children and is confident she can twist footballer partner Scott's arm.

'I really want to have four', she said at the time. 'I think Scott's like 'maybe three' but I don't know, we'll see how we go, but I definitely want more. I'm sure I'll get my own way eventually.'
