Studio 10 panellist Joe Hildebrand has announced he is quitting the show live on air.

On Thursday, the 44-year-old broke down in tears as he revealed he had come to the difficult decision to depart the show after seven years of service following a 'huge amount of thought'.

The presenter's position on the morning talk show had been in discussion ever since Channel 10 announced their shocking budget cuts last month.

Joe's Studio 10 co-hosts Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling were one of the 25 staff members to fall victim to the cuts.

Addressing the uncertainty surrounding his own position on the show, Joe explained that he 'wanted to rip the band-aid off and not make it harder than it has to be'.

Joe was joined by Kennerley as well as entertainment reporter Angela Bishop and journalist Sarah Harris when he announced his departure. 

A devastated Joe began: 'I do have some news. I want to say it here first before you saw it or heard it anywhere else.

'I am leaving Studio 10. I have given it a huge amount of thought. It's been really hard, but also really lovely to be able to look back on all the things we have done.

'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role. We talked about it openly and warmly about what that might look like.'  

Speaking of his bosses' reaction when he told them he planned on leaving Studio 10, Joe added: 'They're really lovely about it, so don't lash out at them!

'I just thought, it's probably just better to draw a line under this amazing little story that I've been lucky enough to be a part of.

'[I want to] give the show a chance to breathe and have a fresh start without me hanging around.

'With all painful things you want to rip the band-aid off quickly and not make it any harder than it otherwise would be.

'It's just been an amazing... I promise I wouldn't use the word 'journey'... but [it's been] such an amazing time!'

Just last week, Joe revealed Studio 10 was set to dramatically change.

'Look we are in talks, they're rejigging the show a bit and it's all been very civil and very lovely,' Joe said, discussing his future with the morning program.

'And they've offered me a new role and we're sort of talking about what that might be.'

He clarified: 'It would be a new role on Studio 10, but I think it's already out there Studio 10 will be a different show.'

Last month, Joe's fellow panellists Kerri-Anne and Natarsha were made redundant from the show along with 25 other staff members.
