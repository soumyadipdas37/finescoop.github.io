Shia LaBeouf recently dropped out of his role in Olivia Wilde's upcoming film, on which he was replaced with Harry Styles.

But the former Disney Channel star is keeping busy with other projects, when he's not isolating at home.

He showed off his toned legs Saturday in some skintight black Nike leggings, as he enjoyed answered a call, while taking a jog through his Pasadena neighborhood.

The 34-year-old complemented the leggings with a printed white t-shirt and a pair of black trainers with white socks.

He was all smiles, as he stopped in the street to laugh with a friend during their impromptu phone call.   

LaBeouf dropped out of Wilde's Don't Worry, Darling earlier this month over scheduling conflicts, according to Deadline.

He was replaced by Styles, who joins Dakota Johnson, Florence Pugh and Chris Pine in the cast of the psychological thriller.

The Honey Boy actor is keeping busy with a drive-in play, produced by Slauson Rec Theater Company, which he co-founded.

Entitled 5711 Avalon, the original COVID-based drama chronicles a day at a testing site in Los Angeles.

The play premieres October 4 at 5711 S Avalon in Los Angeles, with performances every weekend in October.

It comes after his film Pieces of a Woman premiered earlier this month at the Venice Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival.      

LaBeouf also stole the show last week, when he joined Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston for a virtual charity read of the 1982 teen comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
