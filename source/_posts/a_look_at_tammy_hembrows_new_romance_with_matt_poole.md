Tammy Hembrow went public with her new boyfriend, Matt Poole, this month.

And in candid YouTube video on Thursday, the model and entrepreneur, 26, answered a series of questions from Instagram fans, alongside her 32-year-old beau.

The genetically blessed couple revealed who is 'most dominant' in the relationship, and who was the first to say 'I love you'.

'I think you're the dominant one,' Matt, a lifesaver and Ironman said. 'I go along and I go along, and then when you push me too far, I snap, and you go, "Oh, too far".'

'Yeah, I would agree,' Tammy replied. 'I just think I'm quite a dominant person.'   

The pair, who met at an event in Bali, Indonesia last year, also revealed who was the first to say 'I love you'.

Easygoing: 'I think you're the dominant one,' Matt, a 32-year-old lifesaver and Ironman said. 'I go along and I go along, and then when you push me too far, I snap, and you go, "Oh, too far"' 

Smitten: Matt revealed that he was the first to say 'I love you' after they had a 'little fight', while Tammy, 26, said those three words on their recent trip together to the Whitsunday Islands 

'I did, I am obsessed,' Matt said, while Tammy explained how the confession came about after they 'had that little fight'.

'We had a little fight over nothing, and then when he was trying to make up with me and apologise, he told me he loved me,' the fitness mogul said.   

Tammy went on to reveal that she told Matt those three words during their trip to the Whitsunday Islands this month.   

Playful: Elsewhere on the YouTube episode, Tammy joked that while they hardly fight, she could see herself 'winning' their 'future arguments'
