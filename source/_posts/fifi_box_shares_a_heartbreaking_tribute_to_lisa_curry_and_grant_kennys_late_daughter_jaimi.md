Fifi Box has shared a heartbreaking tribute to Jamini, the eldest daughter of her ex-partner Grant Kenny, who lost her battle with an unspecified illness on Monday at the age of 33.

The radio host, who shared a close bond with Jaimi despite splitting from her father Grant eight years ago, posted a series of photos of her daughter Trixie with her older half-sister to Instagram.

'The loss of such a beautiful loving sister and friend is suffocating. We laughed, we cried, we shared so many wonderful memories that I will keep alive for Trixie who loved her big sister so much, her little heart is broken,' she wrote.
