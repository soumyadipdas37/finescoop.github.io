The Crown actress Claire Foy put on a very animated display when she enjoyed an al fresco lunch with a male friend in north London on Monday.

She gesticulated wildly with her arms as she told a story and appeared to have her pal's complete attention. 

Story to tell: Claire Foy put on a VERY animated display as she enjoyed an al fresco lunch with a friend in north London on Monday 

OMG! The 36-year-old pulled a series of hilarious expressions as she enjoyed a coffee in the sunshine

Claire appeared perfectly dressed for the capital's heatwave, wearing a cotton dress which had spaghetti straps and a tiered section throughout the skirt.

She wore a black leather bag across her body and sunglasses, wearing her brunette locks down and in a relaxed style.  

Claire wore a pair of gold classic sandals for a comfortable look. 

The former Crown actress told how her daughter, Ivy Rose, five, recently returned to school. 

Claire admitted to being concerned about the prospect of her child growing up 'in a world where everyone is wearing a face mask'.

She said: 'She's back at school. The most important thing for kids at this point is to have contact with other children.

'I find myself thinking, "Is my child going to grow up in a world where everyone is wearing a face mask?"'

Claire added that she has tried to remain 'calm' about the prospect as she doesn't want her daughter to grow up thinking the world is 'scary'.

The actress also told how she is concerned about what the theatre industry will look like in a post-lockdown world.

Claire said there is something 'special' about theatre and people learn about themselves and society by watching plays. 

Meanwhile, her former onscreen husband Matt Smith. who played Prince Philip in The Crown, spent Friday evening with Emilia Clarke, Princess Daenerys Targaryen in Game Of Thrones, sparking speculation of romance. 

The pair – who appeared together in the 2015 movie Terminator: Genisys – were all smiles as they sauntered through Soho together.
