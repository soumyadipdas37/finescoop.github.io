Harry Kane has revealed he has been texting Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden after the shamed pair were axed from the England squad for sneaking an Icelandic beauty queen into the team hotel in Reykjavik. 

Boss Gareth Southgate sent the two young players home after the 1-0 win over Iceland after details emerged that they had brought two women into the team hotel, breaching coronavirus protocols.

England went onto Denmark without them and after Tuesday night's 0-0 draw Kane revealed he had been keeping in close contact with Greenwood and Foden to ensured 'it's a lesson learned'.  

The young duo were photographed in the hotel room by the girls who stopped by to visit them



'The two lads have made a mistake and they know that, and they'll definitely learn from that,' Kane said. 

'It's a lesson learned for any young player or any player that comes up to the England team that there's a lot of responsibility and a lot of people are watching. All they can do is learn from it.

'It's a situation that the boys have made but, at the end of the day, everyone makes mistakes in life. It's not something I can control or the other players can control.

'It's a decision that has been made and I'm sure the boys would love to take it back if they could but that's not the case.'

More to follow.
