A naked man was seen carrying what is believed to be a severed hand after broke through a window and escaped from a home where he was being held captive by abductors.  

It is understood the man had his hand badly wounded or severed before or after smashing through the front window of a house in Convamore Road, Grimsby, to escape his abductors.

The picture appears to show him carrying something in his free hand. One witness said they thought the object was a body part.

The incident triggered a major response by police and the ambulance service to the scene in East Marsh.

The injured man sought refuge in a shop across the road after the incident late on Saturday afternoon. Paramedics treated him at the scene before he was taken to hospital.

It is believed he was being held against his will at the house after being forced to leave another address in Cleethorpes earlier on Saturday.

The image, caught by a shocked passer-by, shows the man naked near the Lifestyle Express corner shop on the corner of Convamore Road and Ropery Street.

His left lower arm is hidden by his body but in his right hand he appears to be carrying something, which is also shown in the shadow cast on the ground.

There are reports he had been beaten in the house, possibly by two men, before he managed to escape by throwing himself through the window.

A terraced house across the road from the shop had its ground floor window almost completely smashed out. It was sealed off by police after the incident.

A heavy police presence was in the area following the incident on Saturday afternoon.

Witnesses reported smashed glass from the ground floor window of the house and medical staff at the scene. Medical equipment used to treat the man was lying outside the Lifestyle Express shop.

One said: "Apparently the man jumped out of the window without any clothes on and ran across the road to a shop.

"It looks like he was treated by paramedics in the shop."

Several police cars and vans descended on the area with officers setting up a large scene of crime area.

Convamore Road was cordoned off from Sixhills Street to Ropery Street, with motorists being turned around.

Detectives were seen conducting door to door enquiries as they waited for Crime Scene Investigators to arrive.

Humberside Police have been contacted for comment.
