She's been enjoying the Stateside life ever since she relocated to California to be closer to her boyfriend Anwar Hadid. 

And Dua Lipa looked sensational as she stepped out with her beau, 21, after enjoying lunch at Nobu in Malibu, California, on Sunday.

The singer, 25, showed off her enviable figure in a form-fitting red tank top that had cut-out detailing on the front and sides to give a glimpse of her toned abs.

Dua paired her striking top with a pair of high-waist denim jeans that fit on her frame loosely, and she stepped out in black trainers.

Her raven tresses were pulled up into a tight bun, and she made sure to keep safe amid the coronavirus crisis by wearing a white face mask. 

Anwar, meanwhile, kept things casual as he donned a black-and-white baseball top with black jeans, while he colour-coordinated the look with white trainers.

Following Dua's example, the younger brother of Gigi and Bella also wore a face mask, though his was black to match his look.

Unfamiliar with Rui Zhou? Despite only launching in 2018, the designer has amassed a celebrity following in the form of Chloe and Halle, Madison Beer, Doutzen Kroes and now Dua Lipa.

Rui describes her aesthetic as "aiming to celebrate the poetic elegance in between the skin and the garment" and that's more than evident in her work! 

Here Dua can be seen wearing a variation of the SS20 cut-out tank top. All of Rui's work features laddered effects and cut-outs, and this piece is no exception.

Their outing comes after Dua upped sticks and travelled across the pond to Los Angeles to be closer to California native Anwar.

The Sun reported The One Kiss hitmaker has relocated stateside to live with her partner due to fears that she won't be able to travel to and fro because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK. 

A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end. 

'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic. 

'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time.
