A mother of baby twins struggling to cope mentally amid the coronavirus pandemic found solace in the stock market, racking up thousands of dollars within weeks.  

Caitlin Edie, 30, from the Gold Coast but living in Sydney, turned to stock trading in April as a personal project while stuck at home during lockdown. 

She placed an initial investment of $1000 in Afterpay and Webjet shares, which rapidly jumped to $4500 in four weeks, before later growing to $6000. 

'I had nothing in my life that was mine,' the mother-of-four told Daily Mail Australia. 

Mother-of-four Caitlin Edie, 29, began trading on the stock market to 'fill the void of daily life pre-COVID-19'. She is pictured with twins Roya and Yazmin

'I cannot even try to explain how overwhelmed I was at the beginning of COVID-19. It has changed my life.'

Ms Edie, whose daughters Roya and Yazmin were only three months old when the outbreak hit, said trading has been a saviour for her in darker times. 

The property manager kept a busy schedule and worked until just a few weeks before the birth of the twins in November last year. 

But when the country entered lockdown in March, the full-time mum found herself feeling extremely stressed in isolation, home schooling daughters, Violet, seven, and Harmony, five, while caring for the twins.

She fell ill with a post-cesarean infection that made her exhausted and, as the pandemic crippled the economy, there were fears Ms Edie's partner Iman, also 30, may lose his job in real estate. 

'All of a sudden here I am alone, recovering from the pregnancy,' she said. 

'My mental health started to plummet, I had no support because our families couldn't visit because of the lockdown. 

'It was a nightmare for the majority of March.'

Ms Edie bought shares in Afterpay and Webjet for $1000, which rapidly grew to a total of $6000 in about four weeks

Ms Edie loved her job and has missed work since leaving in November last year to give birth to the twins (pictured) 

Everything changed the following month when she discovered stockbroking app Commonwealth Securities, or CommSec, and began buying shares. 

1. Do your own research

2. Don’t put in more money than you are willing to lose

3. Hold stock positions for a minimum of 12 months 

4. Do not panic when shares' values go up and down

5. Have a diverse profile 

Fortunately, her initial investments paid off- something she credited as a 'fluke' and not calculated at all. 

'I don't even know how I wound on CommSec,' she said.

'I was just adding different stocks, having a look on google for stocks to add and looking at at the app for about a week.'

'We were lucky we had a bit of savings before COVID hit, so we had a bit more of a buffer than other Australian families had.' 

Ms Edie, who missed work, said the project was 'not about money' but about having something of her own, although she does enjoy holding winning positions.

She reinvested some of her profits, and six months later is sitting on $10,000 worth of stock.

In total, she has invested $3000, but said she is very careful and decisive before laying money down.

As her project has made her thrive and eased stress, the positive effects have radiated throughout her entire family.

'It has inspired us as a family. It has given us a new outlook on money and how even in lockdown where people don't have money, you can create the opportunity to make money.' 

Ms Edie offered five tips for anyone considering entering training. 

The first step is to do research to find out which companies you may be interested in investing in, and their prospect for increasing in value. 

'I research everything for a couple of weeks before I invest,' she said. 

'Do not jump on the 'fear of missing out' bandwagon. Watch the stock, read the announcements, look up the company.

'It is so important.'

When lockdown hit, Ms Edie began home schooling her older daughters, Violet, seven (far right) and Harmony, five, while looking after the newborn twins 

Once you have selected a stockbroking firm, Ms Edie recommends not put more money into shares that you are willing to lose.    

'If you can put in $500 don't put in a $1000. If the market takes a turn for the worst you are going to lose sleep over it,' she said.  

While Ms Edie uses CommSec, she said there are other stockbroking apps available, some that can sync with your bank, making the process user friendly.

To see the best results, hold your stock positions for a minimum of 12 months.

'Let them have the time to have time to grow,' she said.

'If you have done your research and you believe the in the company there is no reason to just let them go.'

Next, remain calm if share values fluctuate. 

'Don't panic when stocks go up and down. That is what the stock market is meant to do,' she said. 

Last, ensure you keep a diverse profile.

'Profile diversity is important as it helps balance your profile out. Do not invest everything in one place.'
