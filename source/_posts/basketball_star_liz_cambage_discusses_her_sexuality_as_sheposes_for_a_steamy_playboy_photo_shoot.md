Liz Cambage has spoken candidly about her sexuality while posing in racy lingerie for Playboy magazine.

The basketball star, 29, said she 'spent years confused' about her sexual orientation but the steamy photo shoot has allowed her to 'celebrate her sexuality'.

'I've never embraced my sexuality in public. Me doing Playboy is me celebrating my sexuality like, "Yeah, I am a straight six-foot-eight woman who likes to have sex." I'm a human, it's what we do,' she said.

'As a female athlete, I feel like I'm not allowed to be sexy and I'm not allowed to be that person. All society wants from me is to sit down, shut up, go to training and play my sport,' she added.

Liz went on to say she has felt 'a lot of pressure on my sexual identification' and she's 'spent years confused'.

'Am I straight? Am I bi? Is there something wrong with me that I'm not attracted to girls? Everyone's always expecting me to be gay. I'm like, "No, I love men",' she said.

Liz also shared photos from her steamy photo shoot to her Instagram page and said it's 'important to feel confident in your own skin'.

She wrote: 'I spent so many years as a teenager hating myself, trying to shrink myself in to someone I'm not. 

'I really do hope my self love can help inspire those struggling to love their reflection, because I promise you, you are beautiful and loveable just the way you are!!!'
