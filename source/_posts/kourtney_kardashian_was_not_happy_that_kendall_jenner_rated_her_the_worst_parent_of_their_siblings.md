Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kourtney Kardashian told her half-sister Kendall Jenner she 'was not happy' that she rated her the worst parent of their siblings while doing a joint interview.

It stemmed from the 24-year-old Society Management Model's December 10th appearance on The Late Late Show with guest host Harry Styles, who cornered her with the question under threat of drinking 1,000-year-old eggnog.

'I'll start by saying they all really are amazing. They really are! I swear!' Kendall stressed during a game of Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts.

'I'd say [my half-brother] Rob is number one. He is so good to his daughter. That's so hard! They're all amazing. Then it would be like Khloé, Kim, Kylie, Kourtney.'

The 41-year-old Poosh founder was eventually informed of the 'joke' insult after running into Kendall at a party.

'I went up to you because I was like, "I'm going to put Rob before us and the rest,"' Jenner clarified on Thursday's episode of Sibling Revelry with Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson.

'"So I'm just going to throw them out there," and I swear to God Kourtney happened to be the last one.'

During a game of Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts, Kendall reluctantly admitted: 'I'd say [my half-brother] Rob is number one. He is so good to his daughter. That's so hard! They're all amazing. Then it would be like Khloé, Kim, Kylie, Kourtney' 

Kardashian said she thought the Stuck With U video vixen only picked her because Kim Kardashian West and Kylie Jenner would have flipped out otherwise.

'I don't know if I make an easy target or if they think I'm not gonna say anything,' the half-Armenian beauty marveled.

'Or if it's just like if she would've said that about Kim or Kylie. Me or Khloé would've been the easiest ones to say it about.'

Kourtney has three children - son Mason, 10; daughter Penelope, 8; and son Reign, 5 - with Talentless CEO Scott Disick, whom she split from in 2015 after an on/off nine-year relationship.

Kardashian and Jenner's interview came two days after the family officially announced that their E! reality series would conclude in the 20th season, which premieres 'early next year.'

The University of Arizona grad had previously announced her intention to step back from KUWTK in March due to the 'toxic environment' which lead to an on-camera physical fight with Kim.

And according to The Sun, established model Kendall felt she 'no longer needed' the show, which scored its ratings high in 2010 with 5.8M viewers.

KUWTK originally premiered in October 2007 - eight months after Kim's 2002 sex tape was leaked and bought for $1M by Vivid Entertainment.
