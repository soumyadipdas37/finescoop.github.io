Johnny Depp has been romantically linked to German model and Made In Chelsea star Sophie Hermann.

The Hollywood actor, 57, is rumoured to be seeing the fashionista, 33, having reportedly met her at swish London hotel, The Corinthia.

According to sources, Johnny and Sophie - who lives in London and has appeared on Made In Chelsea on and off since 2013 - first came into contact earlier this year.

German press reports that, 'Sophie left her phone number on a piece of paper and slid it between the strings of his guitar,' after which the couple, 'spoke on the phone a lot'.

MailOnline has approached reps for both Johnny and Sophie for comment.

Bombshell Sophie first appeared on the London-based structured reality series on E4 during its sixth season.

Despite taking a break from the show for two years, she is currently a main cast member, seen mostly in scenes with co-stars Ollie Locke, Olivia Bentley and Fredrik Ferrier.

Over the years, Sophie and Fredrik were romantically linked, but the pair are merely good friends. Sophie otherwise keeps her love life off-screen. 

Meanwhile, actor Depp is currently embroiled in a legal battle with his ex-wife Amber Heard and The Sun, which has played out publicly at the High Court in London over the summer.

The sensational showdown has seen the Pirates Of The Caribbean star sue the newspaper for libel, with his actress ex, 34, giving evidence as part of The Sun's defence against Depp's claim over a December 2018 article it published that referred to him as a 'wife-beater'.

The three-week hearing delved into details of their relationship, including that Depp branded her 'Amber T***' because he believed that she had soiled the marital bed after a row at her 30th birthday party.

She denied the claim.

It was also alleged that Depp – who is expected to begin filming on the second instalment of JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts franchise in London next month – used his damaged finger to write 'I love you' on a mirror after it was severed during a clash with Heard in 2015.

Depp's barrister David Sherborne described the actress as a 'compulsive liar' who had 'tailored her story to meet the evidence'.

She is now bracing herself for a second bruising court battle with her ex-husband, according to reports.

The libel case is expected to reach a verdict any day, and Heard's legal team are said to be preparing for a potential fresh clash in the American courts, thanks to her claims on the stand.

The Mail On Sunday were informed that Heard's lawyers expect Depp to serve papers in America that could result in her once more giving evidence in court about their marriage and contested allegations that she suffered three years of domestic abuse at his hands.

Depp denies the claims and says his ex-wife was violent towards him.

Depp, who gave days of vivid evidence at London's High Court in July, is already taking action against the 34-year-old actress in the US state of Virginia over a column that she wrote for the Washington Post newspaper in December 2018.

While the article did not mention Depp by name, she described herself as becoming 'a public figure representing domestic abuse' – which his lawyers argue had the effect of falsely portraying him as violent.

A source close to the actress said: 'Amber's team are super nervous about him suing again, this time in the States. It seems that he will stop at nothing to ruin her.

'No matter what the outcome [of Depp's case against The Sun], Amber is preparing for round two, but if Johnny wins his case against The Sun then that's it, he will go and go. This could go on for years to come.'
