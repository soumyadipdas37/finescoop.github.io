NYPD officer, Baimadajie Angwang (pictured), was arrested on Monday for allegedly acting as an illegal agent for China

An officer with the New York City Police Department was arrested on Monday for allegedly acting as an illegal agent for China. 

The officer has been identified in a criminal complaint as Baimadajie Angwang, who was born in Tibet, China. 

Angwang, who lives in Nassau County, Long Island, currently works for the NYPD's 111th precinct in Queens. Angwang, 33, also serves in the US Army Reserve where he holds the rank of staff sergeant. He's stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey in an Airborne Civil Affairs battalion.

According to a criminal complaint, he allegedly began to devise a plan to 'defraud the US Department of Defense, and to obtain money and property from the US' in May 2019. 

The complaint claims that Angwang 'did knowingly act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government' and 'without prior notification to the Attorney General of the United States, as required by law'. 

Authorities said Angwang 'reported to the Consulate [of China] on the activities of ethnic Tibetans, and others, in the New York metropolitan area'.

He allegedly 'spotted and assessed potential ethnic Tibetan intelligence sources in the New York metropolitan area and beyond and identified potential threats' to China in New York.

Angwang is also said to have provided Consulate of China officials 'access to senior NYPD officials through invitations to official NYPD events'.

As part of his job in the Army Reserve, Angwang holds a 'Secret' level security clearance. 

Authorities said he 'initially traveled to the United States on a cultural exchange visa'.

A DailyMail.com request for comment to the NYPD was not immediately returned.  

Angwang has been charged with acting as an agent for China without prior notification to the Attorney General, committing wire fraud, making false statements and and obstructing an official proceeding.
