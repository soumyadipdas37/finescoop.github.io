'Cold' case: Javier Martinez-Aguilar, 42, has been charged with endangering a child and criminal negligence for allegedly letting his 13-year-old stepdaughter drive him to get ice cream while he was drunk

A Texas father's drunken food craving has landed him behind bars after police say he let his 13-year-old stepdaughter drive him to get ice cream. 

Javier Martinez-Aguilar, 42, from Lubbock, was indicted on Tuesday on felony charges of endangering a child and criminal negligence stemming from his alcohol-fueled father-daughter outing earlier this month.

According to police, on September 9, an officer pulled over an SUV in the 2500 block of Avenue Q after it failed to yield the right of way to a patrol vehicle, nearly causing a crash, reported EverythingLubbock.com.

The responding officer approached the vehicle and found a 13-year-old girl behind the wheel, with her purportedly worse-for-wear stepfather in the passenger seat.

Police pulled over Martinez-Aguilar's SUV operated by the child on Avenue Q in Lubbock after the girl failed to yield the right of way to a patrol car 

When asked what she was doing, the teen allegedly replied that 'she was driving her stepfather to get ice cream because he was drunk,' an arrest report stated.

Police said that Martinez-Aguilar was so inebriated that he had a difficult time taking his driver's license out of his wallet.

The stepfather with the sweet tooth was booked into the county jail but was later released on bond.

Police let his stepdaughter go and she was taken home by her older sister.
