Amy Schumer revealed she was recently diagnosed with the tick-borne illness Lyme disease. 

The 39-year-old comedian shared a childhood photo to Instagram on Tuesday saying that though it was recently diagnosed she has 'maybe had it for years.'

On the post, the Trainwreck star asked her followers and famous friends for treatment suggestions as she has been put on the strong antibiotic doxycycline.

A childhood-era Schumer proudly held up a tiny silver fish in a pink tee and a blue ruffled one-piece swimsuit.  'My first ever fishing pole,' she wrote of the bamboo stick pole that she gripped in the photo. 

She used the photo, in which she stood near wild grass, a large shrub and a lake to ask 'Anyone get LYME this summer?'

'I got it and I'm on doxycycline,' the actress added. 'I have maybe had it for years, any advice?' 

Though the mother-of-one clarified that she is feeling good on the treatment, writing 'I also want to say that I feel good and I'm excited to get rid of it.'

Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks.

The most common symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, fatigue and a skin rash called erythema migrans.

The disease can typically be treated by several weeks of oral antibiotics.

But if left untreated, the infection can spread to the joints, heart and nervous symptoms and be deadly.  

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE INFECTED?

During the first three to 30 days of infection, these symptoms may occur:

The rash occurs in approximately 80 per cent of infected people.

It can expand to up to 12 inches (30 cm), eventually clearing and giving off the appearance of a target or a 'bull's-eye'.

Later symptoms of Lyme disease include:

She went on to ask about having alcohol on the antibiotic 'Can you have a glass of wine or two on it?' 

The antibiotic 'is known to interact with alcohol, and the effectiveness of doxycycline may be reduced in people with a history of chronic alcohol consumption,' according to the NHS. 

Since the treatment can cause photosensitivity Schumer said she knows 'to stay out of the sun.' 

Doxycycline isn't the only treatment as she revealed she is also taking an herbal treatment from the medical herb farm Great Cape Herbs known as 'Lyme-2.'

According to the company's website the herb tincture contains Japanese knotweed root, Siberian Ginseng, Red Root, Prickly ash, Cat's Claw and Andrographis paniculata. Schumer went on to ask for any other suggestions as she battles the disease. 

Lyme disease is tick-borne illness caused by bacterium Borrelia burgdorfer, that can bring potentially debilitating symptoms.  

Early early stages of infections, typically within 30 days, symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, muscle and joint aches and Erythema migrans (EM) rash, including a bullseye appearance around the bite area. 

While later stage symptoms include severe headaches and neck stiffness, additional rashes, arthritis with joint pain and swelling, facial or Bell's palsy, heart palpitations, problems with short-term memory and nerve pain. 

Struggles: Schumer has been open about her health in the past and most recently has discussed the extreme morning sickness and severe symptoms she experienced while pregnant with her son Gene, 16-months, who she shares with husband Chris Fischer

She is the latest celebrity to open up about their Lyme Disease diagnosis after Justin Bieber opened up about his diagnosis earlier this year. 

'While a lot of people kept saying Justin Bieber looks like sh*t, on meth etc. they failed to realize I've been recently diagnosed with Lyme disease,' he wrote back in January.  

The Sorry star allegedly said he had felt severely depressed for much of 2019, but it wasn't until later in the year that his doctors realized he was suffering from Lyme disease, he discussed in his Youtube documentary series.
