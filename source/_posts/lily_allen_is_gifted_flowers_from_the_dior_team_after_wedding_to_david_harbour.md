Lily Allen was gifted flowers from Dior's PR team following her surprise nuptials to actor David Harbour in Las Vegas last week.

The singer, 35, took to Instagram on Thursday to show off her stunning bouquet after wearing a 60s-inspired bridal dress by the luxury goods company. 

Addressing the newlywed as 'Mrs. Harbour', an accompanying card read: 'Congratulations! We absolutely love your choice of wedding dress x x x x Sydney [Finch] and all your friends at Dior.' (sic)

The musician exuded glamour in the ensemble, which featured cap sleeves with a boatneck neckline. 

Mother-of-two Lily tied the knot to the Stranger Things star, 45, at the Graceland Wedding Chapel earlier this month.

On Wednesday, the Smile hitmaker revealed she returned to the UK after jetting to the US to wed David, officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator.

It appears that the media personality has headed back to the UK alone, as just a day earlier her new husband was spotted out and about in New York City. 

The brunette posted a snap of her new office with the caption 'Quarantine Studio,' as she began her 14 days in isolation.

Currently COVID-19 guidelines state that any UK resident returning from the United States must isolate for two weeks due to the country's high number of cases.

Meanwhile David was seen in the Big Apple on Tuesday,  despite current COVID-19 regulations that require anyone returning from Nevada to New York to quarantine for 14 days.  

As of September 9, Nevada is listed as a restricted state on the New York government website, with the only exemption being someone who was passing through a restricted state and spent less than 24 hours there. 

DailyMail.com contacted Harbour's representative for comment at the time.

The couple divide their time between the UK and the US and sparked engagement rumours in May when Lily was seen with a sparkler on her ring finger in an Instagram post.  

Sharing photos to his Instagram last week, David wrote: 'In a wedding officiated by the king himself...

'The people's princess wed her devoted, low born, but kind credit card holder in a beautiful ceremony lit by the ashen skies courtesy of a burning state miles away in the midst of a global pandemic.'
