Tottenham announced the return of Gareth Bale to north London last week with Spurs fans excited to see the Welsh winger back on the pitch as a Spurs player. 

The 31-year-old leaves Real Madrid after seven successful years at the Santiago Bernabeu to boost Jose Mourinho side's chances of finishing in the top-four this season.

Bale is likely to line-up in a front three at Spurs alongside Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min, who starred as the north Londoners won 5-2 at St Mary's on Sunday to kick-start their league campaign.

Sportsmail takes a look at how the potential trio of Bale-Kane-Son compares to the other 'Big Six' and whether Spurs have the most exciting front three out of the 'Big Six'... 

ARSENAL

Attackers: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe, Willian

2019/20 Goals: 60* (*Willian was at Chelsea)

Firepower rating: 7/10

On paper, Arsenal's success going forward is reliant on club captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has led the goalscoring charts in each of his two seasons in north London. 

The Gabon forward, who has transitioned to a left-sided player in north London, has 72 goals in 122 appearances for the Gunners and is widely expected to add to his tally as Mikel Arteta's side continue their upward trajectory. 

Though Alexandre Lacazette has shown that he can offer goalscoring opportunities of his own, having netted two goals in two Premier League games at the start of this season. 

£72million-signing Nicolas Pepe needs to improve on last season's total of eight goals and ten assists in all competitions while ex-Chelsea man Willian looks a smart piece of business on a free transfer and registered two assists on his debut against Fulham.

CHELSEA

Attackers: Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech

2019/20 Goals: 72* (Havertz, Werner and Ziyech were playing away from Chelsea)

Firepower rating: 8/10

Chelsea have acquired German duo Kai Havertz (left) and Timo Werner (right) in the market

It's an all-new attack for Chelsea this season as Germany internationals Kai Havertz and Timo Werner have moved to Stamford Bridge after lighting up the Bundesliga last term, while Hakim Ziyech will bring a new dimension off the right wing after his move from Ajax. 

But it's been a slow start to the new-look trio in west London as Ziyech picked up an injury in his pre-season debut for the Blues, while Werner and Havertz have been left empty-handed from their first two Premier League games. 

Havertz's hat-trick in the 6-0 Carabao Cup win over Barnsley on Wednesday night showed more than a glimpse of what he is capable of, however.  

Frank Lampard also has Christian Pulisic to welcome back from injury. The American winger scored 11 goals last season in all competitions, including the opener in the FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal, but picked up a hamstring injury at Wembley to ruin his pre-season development. 

Once Ziyech and Pulisic return from injury and the German duo settle in properly to life at Chelsea, then Lampard will have some devastating options in attack - and we haven't even discussed the likes of Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud yet.

LIVERPOOL 

Attackers: Robert Firmino, Sadio Mane, Mohammed Salah

2019/20 Goals: 57

Firepower rating: 9/10

Teams can't stop Liverpool's Roberto Firmino (left), Mo Salah (middle) and Sadio Mane (right)

It's arguably the most recognisable front three in the Premier League at the moment and despite playing with each other for over three years, no-one really knows how to stop Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. 

Both Salah and Mane have netted twice already this season in the opening two Premier League games, while Firmino showed his excellent link-up play to set up the Senegalese winger's first goal against Chelsea on Sunday with a delightful cross. 

Jurgen Klopp's front three now have even more reasons to be excited following the arrival of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich. The Spanish midfielder is known for his precise passing accuracy, particularly going forward, meaning the attacking trio have another option to get the ball in difficult scenarios. 

The Reds know that their front three will be crucial in their hopes of defending their Premier League crown, but they haven't let the side down so far. The only worry is a lack of depth in attack, but Liverpool do have other options to cope. 

MANCHESTER CITY

Attackers: Sergio Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling

2019/20 Goals: 90

Firepower rating: 9/10

Gabriel Jesus (left) and Raheem Sterling (right) will play key roles for Manchester City this term

Liverpool aren't the only team with their eyes on the Premier League title, with Manchester City looking to regain the crown they handed to Jurgen Klopp's side last term. 

Pep Guardiola also has a whole host of attacking talent at his disposal, though has been dealt a blow as Sergio Aguero has picked up an early season injury.

The blow is softened by Gabriel Jesus' improvement in recent seasons. The Brazilian striker scored 23 times in all competitions last term, a number which could improve this term given Aguero could be out for a maximum of two months.

Raheem Sterling had his best ever season in front of goal last term and was in with a shout of winning the Premier League Golden Boot award right up until the final weekend.

Riyad Mahrez is also an impressive source of goals and will compete alongside new signing Ferran Torres, who joined from Valencia this summer, for one of the wide spots. 

MANCHESTER UNITED 

Attackers: Bruno Fernandes, Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford

2019/20 Goals: 89* (Bruno Fernandes spent the first half of the season at Sporting Lisbon)

Firepower rating: 8/10

Manchester United look set to miss out on Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho during this summer transfer window, though the Red Devils still have plenty of attacking options in the squad. 

The front three of Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford scored 44 out of United's 66 goals in the Premier League last term, with all three possessing pace, power and goalscoring consistency. 

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's attack was also sharpened by the January arrival of Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon. The 26-year-old scored 12 times in his opening six months at Old Trafford and will be looking to add to that 2020 total in the coming weeks.  

Though if United can get their front three firing once again this season, they may not even need Fernandes to get in on the act.

TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR

Attackers: Dele Alli, Gareth Bale, Harry Kane, Son Heung-Min

2019/20 goals: 54* (*Gareth Bale was at Real Madrid last season) 

Firepower rating: 7/10

Gareth Bale will be looking to make the difference at Spurs from the right-wing

Gareth Bale's return to Spurs is one of the most high-profile moves of the summer transfer window so far but Tottenham's goalscoring exploits in the weekend win at Southampton got fans of the north London side even more excited. 

The day after Bale was announced, South Korean forward Son Heung-Min struck four goals in the 5-2 thrashing at St Mary's with all of them being set up by star striker Harry Kane.

After drawing a blank in their opening weekend defeat to Everton, Spurs' key men finally look to have their shooting boots on.

Bale, meanwhile, will provide something new in Jose Mourinho's side from the right-wing as the likes of Lucas Moura and Erik Lamela have become too inconsistent. 

Mourinho's attack will be boosted if they can hold on to Dele Alli, but the England midfielder's performances are dipping and the Spurs boss may be tempted to send the 24-year-old packing to either PSG or Inter Milan.
