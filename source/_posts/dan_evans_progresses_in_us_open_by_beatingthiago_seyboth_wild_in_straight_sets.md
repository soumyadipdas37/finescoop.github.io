Dan Evans topped off an impressive British introduction to the 2020 US Open by becoming the fourth UK star to progress to the second round.

Evans added to the domestic success story at Flushing Meadows by beating Brazil's Thiago Seyboth Wild 6-2 6-1 7-6 (5).

The British number two seized the initiative by fashioning an immediate double-break and proceeded to charge through the opening two sets with an air of confidence.

Seyboth Wild, a former US Open junior champion in 2018, rallied in the third set and forced the tie-break but Evans completed victory on his second match point.

He joins Kyle Edmund, Cam Norrie and Andy Murray in progressing.

The latter pulled off the most emphatic of comebacks, clawing victory from the jaws of defeat against Japanese star Yoshihito Nishioka.

Murray looked down and out, but won two tie-break sets to triumph in the best of five and book his place in the next round.

Evans will now go on to face either Coretin Moutet or Jiri Vesely.
