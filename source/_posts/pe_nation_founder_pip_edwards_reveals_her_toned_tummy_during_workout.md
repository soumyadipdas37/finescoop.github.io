It comes as Pip's relationship with former Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke continues to blossom.

Reports surfaced Michael begun dating Pip after his separation from Kyly Clarke became public knowledge.   

Pip seemingly confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July. 

Michael is notoriously private, and while hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip, he did recently say that he couldn't be happier.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now,' he told The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine this month. 'I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for.'

Michael went on to add that if negative attention is directed at his daughter or partner, it always hits him 'much harder' than if it were something 'thrown' at him.     

Michael, 39, separated from wife Kyly Clarke, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.

The Clarkes have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their four-year-old daughter Kelsey Lee.
