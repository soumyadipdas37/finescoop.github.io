Sir Liam Neeson said portraying an estranged father-son duo in James D'Arcy's dramedy Made in Italy alongside his real-life son Micheál Richardson was 'cathartic in many ways for both of us.'

'[The script] really made my gut turn because it touched on something Micheál and I have both gone through - still going through 11 years after [my wife Natasha Richardson] has died,' the 68-year-old Northern Irishman said on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live on Monday.

'Of course it touches on very, very delicate stuff. But, sometimes you see, that's the wonderful thing. Sometimes in art and you can explore stuff and it's kind of safe, especially with a film.'

Liam added: 'I'm very proud of him Andy. I'm not gonna blow smoke up his a***, but he does have a presence. He really does.'

However, the 25-year-old Big Dogs actor - who was 13 when his 45-year-old mother died of an epidural haematoma after a 2009 ski accident - thought calling the process cathartic was 'too easy and too hippie.'

Micheál told DM's Weekend Magazine last month: 'But I do think that [making Made in Italy] will maybe help at some stage to open a door to our conversations about a number of things. I hope so.'

In order to honor the memory of the late Grammy nominee, Micheál legally changed his surname from Leeson to Richardson in 2018.

'I think the did the right thing. I think it was a lovely homage, a nice gesture,' Neeson told host Andy Cohen.

'He's not saddled with my last name, which you know I have a certain celebrity status I guess. I'd hate for him to be constantly asked, "Oh are you Liam Neeson's son?" So, it was a lovely gesture, you know Natasha's family, mother, and sisters were very touched by it as indeed I was.'

The Oscar nominee has no regrets about playing Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in George Lucas' 1999 prequel Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, which earned $1.027B at the box office despite dismal reviews.

'I know a lot of fans and critics didn't like it,' Liam admitted.
