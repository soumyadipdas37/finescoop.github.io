She recently spoke about her Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis to magazine The Face and talked about how her mental struggles inspired her to make the album.

She said: 'I was suicidal at one point. I was going through a really tough time, and I felt like making a break-up album amidst going through such real shit was dumbing myself down in a way that I didn’t want to do.

'Once I was given a diagnosis...I was getting more in touch with my emotions and figuring out how to be stable. I was able to write better and understand myself better. So I could just write the story how I wanted it to be told.'
