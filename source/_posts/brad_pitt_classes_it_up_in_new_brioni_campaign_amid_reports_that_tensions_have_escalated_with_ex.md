He remains embroiled in the highly publicized aftermath of his last marriage, which ended in 2016. 

But Brad Pitt didn't let any of those stresses show in the new Autumn/Winter 2020 photo campaign for Brioni, the Italian menswear couture house.

In the crisp and classic images released Thursday, the Hollywood leading man, 56, proved he still has charisma to spare as he appeared in a tuxedo as well as other assorted formalwear.

The scruffy and handsome actor, who won his first Academy Award for acting earlier this year, wore his hair long in the quartet of black-and-white images, along with a salt-and-pepper goatee.

The Ad Astra star wrapped himself in a sweater and light wool coat in one closeup image, while in another he modeled a charcoal grey overcoat with a lighter textured suit on underneath.

Brad also showed off an expensive-looking wristwatch and chunky ring in one image, where he donned a suit and dark necktie in an ensemble that looked right out of Mad Men.

The elegant images come as the actor, who launched to fame in 1991's Thelma And Louise, is experiencing renewed tensions with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.

Relations between the former couple who share six children have deteriorated to the point where they are no longer engaging in family therapy ahead of a custody trial slated for next month, UsWeekly reported Thursday.

'Tensions have escalated between Brad and Angelina, with family therapy no longer taking place,' a source exclusively told that outlet.

Pitt and Jolie, 45, had appeared to reach a cordial understanding about co-parenting their kids, with the Once upon A Time... In Hollywood actor spotted leaving the actress' LA home in June after spending time with the children.

However, UsWeekly claims they are now at odds again over how much time they each get with Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and 12-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.

Eldest child Maddox, 19, is allowed to choose his own timetable and is rumored to no longer have any contact with his father.

'Brad wants 50/50 joint physical and legal custody of the kids. Angelina has been unagreeable to those terms,' a source told UsWeekly.

The insider added that Jolie 'will only agree to talk about an agreement if the home base for the children isn't Los Angeles. The younger kids are in school in Los Angeles, which Angelina has always been opposed to.'

It's previously been suggested that Jolie wants to relocate to the UK and base the children with her there.

The reports of renewed friction between the exes come after Pitt visited Château Miraval at the end of August with rumored new girlfriend, German model Nicole Poturalski, 27. 

A trial has been scheduled for October in Los Angeles, California, where a judge will adjudicate on the child custody and support issues that remain unresolved between Jolie and Pitt. 

DailyMail.com has reached out representatives for Pitt and Jolie seeking comment.
