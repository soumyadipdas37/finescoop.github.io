Hugh Jackman's wife Deborra-lee Furness dismissed speculation her husband is 'gay' during her appearance on Anh's Brush with Fame on Tuesday. 

And according to Hugh, 51, the source of these baseless rumours likely dates back to 2003, when he played openly gay singer-songwriter Peter Allen in The Boy from Oz on Broadway.

As part of the role, Hugh was required to kiss his male co-star Jarrod Emick on stage - a surprise to fans who were used to seeing Hugh in the role of macho Marvel character Wolverine.

In 2018, Hugh told a US radio station he believes the on-stage kiss sparked the persistent whispers about his sexuality. 

'Some dudes do get upset, some dudes say, 'Don't say I'm gay' [but] I am good,' he said, as reported by The Metro. 

'I was literally just locking lips... I started to laugh so hard,' Hugh recalled of having to kiss his co-star on stage.

'So I stay kissing him, because I thought, 'I'm just going to laugh. I'm going to stay here until it subsides', and it never subsided and the whole audience could see my body shaking, so they started.'

When The Boy From Oz finished it's tenure on Broadway and began showing in Australia in 2006, however, Hugh was no longer required to kiss his on-stage male lover - who was now being played by Australian actor Murray Bartlett. 

'We just wanted to keep it very simple and very pure,' Bartlett told The Sydney Morning Herald of the decision to remove the kiss.

In fact, the same-sex kiss was never part of the original musical when it was launched in Australia n 1998, and was only added into the script when the production began on Broadway in 2003. 

On Tuesday's episode of Anh's Brush with Fame, Hugh's wife Deborra-Lee, 64, rolled her eyes when asked about the rumours her husband is 'gay'.  

'I see these magazines and they're so mean-spirited… I hope people realise it's all made up,' she said.

She added: '[Hugh's] been gay for so many years, I was gay too when I did [the 1988 film] Shame. They were shocked when I got married. 

'It's just wrong. It's like someone saying to Elton John, 'Oh he's straight'. I'm sure he'd be p**sed! 

'And so what! What are we discussing here… Is he a vegetarian… Is he gay?'
