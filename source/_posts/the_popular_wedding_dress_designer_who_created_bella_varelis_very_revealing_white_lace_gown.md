She pulled out all the stops in a bridal-inspired gown during the rose ceremony on Wednesday night's episode of The Bachelor.

And it has now been revealed that Bella's revealing white gown was designed by popular wedding dress designer, J. Andreatta - who created Jasmine Yarbrough's unforgettable gown for her wedding to Karl Stefanovic.

Hours before the Bachelor finale on Thursday, the wedding dress designer took to her Instagram platform to share a stunning snap of Bella in their jaw-dropping lace number.

'The gorgeous @bellavarelis in 'Le Claudel',' the snap was captioned, in which the stunning 25-year-old smiled for the camera.

Bella's lithe figure was on full display in the gorgeous white dress which teased at her toned legs thanks to its sheer lace bottom half.

It has been two years since Sydney-based Jess Andreatta of J. Andreatta helped Jasmine create the racy wedding dress to her dreams for her marriage to TV host, Karl.

Jasmine's high-low blush-coloured dress had people talking at the time thanks to its short, detachable skirt at the front and a flowing lace train at the back.

Meanwhile, earlier in the day finalist Bella penned a heartfelt message to Locky ahead of the gripping season finale. 

The message was released on The Bachelor's official Instagram account. 

'Never in a million years did I think I would be stepping out of the limo that first night and meeting someone who I'd connect with on so many levels,' she wrote.

Bella said after a 'long' and 'incredible' journey, she can see herself with him, which she called 'simultaneously exciting and petrifying.'     

'After a very long, incredible journey and seeing Locky with my loved ones, I have a full heart and I can definitely picture my life with him.'

She finished by saying that Bachelor has been a 'wild ride' and she is 'grateful' for what she has learnt along the way.

'Regardless of the outcome, this has been one heck of a wild ride and I'm so grateful for the beautiful people I've met along the way and everything I've learnt about myself.'  

Fans are still guessing who will win Locky's heart. The two finalists are Bella and 31-year-old nurse, Irena Srbinovska. 

Paparazzi pictures have emerged that prove the brunette spent the night with former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro at the weekend.

One of Bella's neighbours in Sydney spotted Nathan's Toyota HiLux parked outside her home at about 8pm on Saturday night.

The following morning, at about 9:45am, a nervous-looking Nathan, 25, was pictured leaving the apartment and driving away.  

While these photos aren't irrefutable proof that Bella and Nathan are dating - they could be just friends or he could be seeing Bec - they leave little doubt that Bella doesn't win Locky's heart.  

Competition for his heart? According to Sportsbet, Irena has the shortest odds paying $1.30. While Bella is paying out at $2.95. Here: Bella and Locky

Nathan, however, has repeatedly said the pair are just friends having known each other for a number of years. 

According to the latest Sportsbet odds ahead of the finale, Irena is paying out $1.30. While Bella is paying out at $2.95.       

The Bachelor season finale airs on Channel Ten, Thursday, 7.30pm
