Keanu Reeves has teased what fans can expect from The Matrix 4, calling it a 'love story' that will 'inspire' its audience.

The actor, 56, is returning to his role as Neo for the upcoming blockbuster and said on BBC's The One Show he is currently filming in Berlin, Germany.

Appearing on Wednesday's show via link, host Alex Jones asked the star: 'Can you tell our viewers why you're in Berlin?'

Keanu replied: 'Sure. I'm having the great fortune, thankfully, working on another Matrix film.'

'Number four!' Alex replied. 

'Yes indeed,' Keanu said. 'So we are out here trying to make some magic.'

Ronan Keating, who was guest hosting for the day, said: 'Keanu, I'm not giving any spoilers but I remember at the end of number three it didn't look like you were coming back?'

Keanu agreed, saying: 'No it didn't, it looked a little dire for Neo.'

The actor then discussed the film's script, saying: 'We have a wonderful director, Lana Wachowski, and she has written a beautiful script that is a love story, it's inspiring.

'It's another version, a call to wake up and it has some great action.' Leaning in close to the camera, he added: 'All will be revealed.'

Trying to get more information on the project, Ronan asked would the fourth film be a prequel to the original triology.

Keanu replied: 'No, no. No going in the past.'

It comes after Keanu recentlby had nothing but praise for coronavirus safety measures on the set of The Matrix 4. 

The actor said there were 'thoughtful, effective protocols in place' on set in a video chat interview with the Associated Press.

He said: 'There’s some really thoughtful, effective protocols in place, and the rhythm of filmmaking has not been really impacted or interrupted, in the sense of filming.

'That’s because of the hard work and organization, and again the thoughtfulness that has gone into the protocols.'

Filming originally began in San Francisco, where some locals were angered by property destruction caused in the midst of action scenes.

The production then moved to Berlin in February but was quickly shut down due to the pandemic.

Back in June, Keanu told Empire Magazine that it was the quality of the writing that drew him to this installment of The Matrix, which hasn't gotten a finalised title yet. '

'Lana Wachowski wrote a beautiful script and a wonderful story that resonated with me,' he said. 'That’s the only reason to do it.'

The new working relationship seemed to still have some of the old magic, even though Lana's sister Lilly Wachowski sat out this installment.

Inspirational: Discussing the film's script, he said: 'We have a wonderful director, Lana Wachowski, and she has written a beautiful script that is a love story, it's inspiring' 

'To work with her again is just amazing. It’s been really special, and the story has, I think, some meaningful things to say, and that we can take some nourishment from.'

The Matrix was originally envisioned as a science fiction–action film starring Will Smith in the Neo role, though he turned it down, and Val Kilmer as Morpheus, who was eventually played by Laurence Fishburne.

The ground-breaking film went on to be one of the most successful films of 1999 and earned four Academy Awards, along with copious praise from critics.

Two sequels, Reloaded and Revolutions, were filmed back-to-back and released close together in 2003.
