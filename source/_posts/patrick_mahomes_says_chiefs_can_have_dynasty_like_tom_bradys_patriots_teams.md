Patrick Mahomes says he thinks his Kansas City Chiefs can recreate the run Tom Brady had during his time with the Patriots.

The quarterback told Kansas City's 610 Sports Radio's The Drive his thoughts on the big picture after he was asked about the chances of a dynasty like Brady's Pats, which won six Super Bowls in nine appearances in the big game from 2001 until 2019. (Brady's era with the Pats ended earlier this year when he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.)

Mahomes - who ended the team's 50-year Super Bowl drought earlier this year with a win over the San Francisco 49ers - said that 'it's going to take everybody in the organization, top-down, to do something like that,' crediting the Pats' attention to detail under head coach Bill Belichick.

'If you watch how they run their organization, how they run their football team, how they're coached, how they play ... they give 120 percent every single rep, every single practice,' said Mahomes, who signed a 10-year, $503 million contract extension with the team this past summer.

'That's what we have to try to do, try to strive for,' he said, 'that's why it doesn't happen a lot in the NFL - it's because you can't have that culture every single year it seems like.'

Belichick was at a loss for words when asked about Mahomes after he again dominated on the national stage Monday, tossing four touchdowns and running in another in his team's 34-20 victory over the Baltimore Ravens on Monday Night Football.

'All the superlatives that have been said about him, I'd just be repeating them all,' Belichick told ESPNs Mike Reiss of Mahomes, who achieved a massive feat in becoming the fastest-ever NFL player to reach the 10,000 passing yard milestone, needing just 34 games to do so.

Mahomes credited Chiefs head coach Andy Reid for having built 'built a great culture' with the team, which also features standout players such as wide receiver Tyreek Hill, tight end Travis Kelce and safety Tyrann Mathieu.

'We're just gonna take it week-by-week, day-by-day, and try to get the best out of each other every single day,' he said. 'And then when we look back at the end of our careers, we'll have no regrets because we know that we left everything we had out there on the field and in the media room.'

Mahomes' contract made him the highest-paid athlete in the history of professional sports, surpassing the $426.5 million deal baseball superstar Mike Trout inked with the Los Angeles Angels last year.

Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt said of the contract: 'Since he joined the Chiefs just a few years ago, Patrick has developed into one of the most prolific athletes in all of sports ... he’s an extraordinary leader and a credit to the Kansas City community, and I’m delighted that he will be a member of the Chiefs for many years to come.' 

Mahomes chat with the station after he and his fiancee Brittany Matthews announced Tuesday that they're expecting their first child together. Matthews, a 25-year-old fitness entrepreneur, posted a shot of the pair together holding an ultrasound.

She captioned the shot, 'Mom & Dad, taking a small detour to the wedding' as she and the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback embraced. The quarterback and his longtime love have dated since they both attended Whitehouse, Texas's Whitehouse High School, going to the prom in 2013.

Matthews said on social media, 'My heart is so full! I love this man so incredibly much and today was so so special! Couldn't imagine this day being any more perfect.' 

Patrick's brother Jackson Mahomes said in response, 'You guys will be the best parents!! CANT WAIT TO BE uncle Jack!!!' 

Matthews' friend Kayla Nicole, who was previously romantically linked to Mahomes' teammate Travis Kelce, also chimed in with a supportive message.

'I mean I thought it was gonna be hard for y’all to top 2020, but BOOM,' she said. 'A baby Mahomie??!?!?!!? CANT WAIT. Love y’all.'
