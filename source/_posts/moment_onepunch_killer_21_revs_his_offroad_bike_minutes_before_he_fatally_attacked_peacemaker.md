This is the moment a killer revs his off-road bike just minutes before he fatally attacked a peacemaker who asked him to stop dangerously riding in front of children.  

James Rowley, 21, was this week jailed for nine years having brutally assaulted Joe Higgins, 41, in front of horrified youngsters in Coventry after he was spotted tearing across grassland on a stolen scrambler on March 17.

The victim had approached the biker menace and 'politely' asked him to stop his nuisance riding over fears for the safety of young children playing outside.

But Rowley proceeded to rev the bike's engine - with the spinning wheels showering Mr Higgins with dirt - before he floored the care manager with a single punch.

Mr Higgins, who had just returned home from celebrating St Patrick's Day, suffered a serious head injury and died the following day in hospital.

Following the attack, Rowley picked up the victim's St Patrick's Day hat 'as a trophy' and was spotted dancing around while wearing it in the street.

The former warehouse worker was then heard laughing and he sped away on the bike from the scene in Jubilee Crescent, Coventry.

Rowley handed himself in to West Midlands Police on March 20 after detectives launched a murder enquiry.

He originally claimed Mr Higgins approached in an aggressive manner shouting 'I'm gonna do you' and suggested he only threw a punch in self-defence.

And in police interview he described himself as a dad and the 'softest, nicest guy you ever come across'.

However, witnesses earlier described seeing Rowley, of Radford, Coventry, speeding through residential streets, jumping red lights and mounting pavements.

At one point he got into a heated argument with a motorist after nearly causing a crash at traffic lights.

Rowley also has a record of violence - including assaulting his own mum when he was 14 where he grabbed her by the throat, slapped her and later told police 'she needs a bullet between her eyes'.

CCTV and social media footage also showed him dangerously running through red lights, loudly revving his engine and performing 'donuts' on a piece of grassland.

Rowley later changed his account in the face of damning evidence and went on to admit manslaughter and dangerous driving.

He was jailed for nine years at Warwick Crown Court on Monday.

Detective Inspector Jim Colclough described Mr Higgins' death as tragic and senseless following the case.

He said: 'Joe grew up in the area and didn't like people disrespecting his community.

'Witnesses describe him approaching Rowley politely; he wanted to convey his concerns for the danger he posed to people.

'Some witnesses described seeing Rowley laughing and dancing in the victim's hat after the fatal punch.

'Rowley's violence was witnessed by several children in the street.

'He lay low for two days before handing himself in. The judge said he spent the time 'planning the lies he was to tell the police in interview'.

'But we had already gathered testimonies from independent witnesses, plus seized CCTV and social media video showing Rowley's dangerous riding and the assault.

'My sympathies remain with Mr Higgins' friends and family.'
