An Australian mum and entrepreneur has shared her quick and easy baking recipe to make a healthy Snickers mousse.

Rhian Allen, founder of The Healthy Mummy, revealed the recipe on her website and social media pages to her thousands of followers.

The mousse itself doesn't have any trace of Snickers chocolate, but instead replicates the taste to create a healthy alternative.

The five-ingredient recipe involves two steps and only takes a quick five minutes to make, so it can be prepared while dinner is cooking. 

In an attempt to keep things simple in the kitchen, an Australian mummy blogger has shared her quick and easy baking recipe to make a Snickers mousse

The recipe is part of Rhian's 28 Day Weight Loss Challenge guide and is ideal to have as a healthy, sweet snack while losing weight.

'When dessert is this tasty, you won't believe that it's actually made with healthy ingredients that are good for you,' Rhian said online.

To make the mousse, home bakers will need ricotta cheese, cacao or cocoa powder, peanut butter, maple syrup and dark chocolate.

The first step simply involves mixing the ingredients together thoroughly in a bowl, followed by serving the mousse with extra dark chocolate pieces.
