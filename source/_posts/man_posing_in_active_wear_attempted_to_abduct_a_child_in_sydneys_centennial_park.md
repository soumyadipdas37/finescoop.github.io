A man wearing expensive active wear and carrying a duffle bag allegedly tried to abduct a child in front of their parents and grandparents. 

A Sydney mother took to Facebook to warn people about the man who she said had an Eastern European accent and was built like a personal trainer.

She said the man, who looked about 30-years-old and had olive skin and grey active wear, was trying to get the attention of her friend's child at Centennial Park on November 24. 

A well built man in active wear allegedly tried to abduct a small child from in front of his parents and grandparents at Sydney's Centennial Park (pictured) on November 24 

He allegedly said he'd mistaken the small boy for his own child before he moved on.  

Mrs Harris said the young man started calling out for someone named 'Olly' before he left the park without a child in toe.

The concerned mother said she'd heard the same man had allegedly been seen at the Clovelly playground, and around the Waverley area, in Sydney's east.

A NSW Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia there was no report released on the alleged incident.
