He was the third celebrity contestant to be unveiled ahead of the forthcoming eighteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing. 

And Max George has waste no time in getting himself fit and ready for the ballroom floor ahead of the season launch in September. 

Taking to Instagram on Monday evening, The Wanted star, 32, shared images of his gruelling workout regime as he put in the hard yards during a recent gym session.

Revealing a toned and muscular physique, Max looked focused while working on his core strength with a series of upper body exercises, among them chest presses, press ups and resistance band reps. 

In a final shot Max appears to be completely exhausted as he takes a well earned breather after the workout at Sam Witter's personal fitness studio in Manchester's Salford Quays. 

Referencing his intense workout, he captioned the snaps: Big session tonight  @swh_gym. The last picture says it all.'

Max will be hoping his hard work doesn't go to waste when he makes his Strictly bow with a yet to be announced professional dance partner. 

Confirming his involvement on BBC's The One Show, the singer admitted he has already spoke to former bandmate Jay McGuinness, who won Strictly's coveted Glitter Ball in 2015. 

'I spoke to Jay earlier, he left me a couple of voice notes,' Max explained, as host Alex Jones asked how he thinks he'll measure up to his old friend.

'Oh no chance, there’s no comparison, but he might be able to mentor me maybe through Zoom, he may be able to help me out. He did say he can imagine me like a little schoolboy, nervous,' he replied.

Max rose to fame in 2009 with the group - completed by Siva Kaneswaran, Tom Parker and Nathan Sykes - known best for hit song All Time Low.

A source told The Sun: 'Max is a great signing and bosses hope he’ll help bring in a younger audience to the show as he was part of a really popular boyband.

'It’s great for the show to have a hunk already secured to take part and given his time singing they’re hoping he has good dancing feet.'
