Barcelona will hope to put their summer crisis behind them as they embark upon a new season under Ronald Koeman who takes charge of the Spanish side for the first time.

The Dutchman was appointed following a summer that saw Barca lose out in LaLiga title race as well as suffer an 8-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, leading to the sacking of Quique Setien as manager.

Key man Lionel Messi had also looked to leave the club but he starts on Sunday night for the 8pm BST kick-off against Villarreal at the Nou Camp. Follow all the action as it happens.

Host commentator

Ronald Koeman has named his first official starting lineup as Barcelona manager.

Philippe Coutinho, back from his loan spell at Bayern Munich, is involved from the outset, as is Ansu Fati, who has been officially promoted to the first-team squad.

Lionel Messi, of course, also starts after he ended up staying at the club.

Neto is in goal, with Marc-Andre Ter Stegen out injured. 

Barcelona: Neto; Roberto, Pique, Lenglet, Alba; Busquets, De Jong; Messi, Coutinho, Fati; Griezmann

Subs: Pena, Rafinha, Araujo, Dembele, Pjanic, Ramos, Firpo, Puig, Alena, Trincao, Pedri.
