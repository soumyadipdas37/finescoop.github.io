The Our Girl star wore a chic black sports bra and high-waist leggings as she posed for the camera while surrounded by gym equipment.

Michelle wore her raven locks in a high bun and showcased her stunning features with a make-up free look. 

She described the workout as a 'tough sesh today' and tagged the fitness platform set up by her TV presenter partner and his brother to help others stay fit during lockdown. 

Michelle recently admitted she loved the lockdown period because it has given the jet-setting couple the opportunity to spend quality time together, walking their dogs, doing jigsaws and cycling near their Essex home.

The experience has also given the actress the opportunity to start writing her own material, and she has already had interest from production companies about potentially developing her projects. 

She said in a recent interview with Cosmopolitan magazine:  'We [Mark and I] were saying we'd enjoyed it. It's been nice because we've both been working from home. 

'Normally we could be out all day or I have to go to Manchester [to film Brassic] or Mark is in London.

'I'm taking my dogs for daily walks, I've been doing a jigsaw a week and I've taken up cycling on a proper road bike. We go out three times a week and do 11 miles!

'I'm writing two things. I've never had the time to sit down, write and research and I'm really enjoying the process. It's a comedy drama and a mini-series drama.

'I had the idea for one of them a few years ago and this time has helped me get my ideas down on paper. 

'I've had meetings with production companies on Zoom. Hopefully it's something we can get off the ground. It's exciting.'
