She recently returned from a sun-drenched trip to Ibiza with her two sons. 

And Louise Redknapp was in a nostalgic mood on Tuesday as she looked back on her summer surrounded by her children and 'amazing friends' in an Instagram post. 

The singer, 45, looked radiant in a snap with her sons Charley, 16, and Beau, 11, on holiday as she shared a series of sweet pictures with her nearest and dearest.

With her caramel blonde tresses cascading down her back, Louise put on a stylish display in a polka dot cream shirt dress. 

Showcasing her sun-kissed décolletage, Louise added layered gold necklaces as she posed beside her two boys. 

Meanwhile Charley looked smart in a pink shirt with navy shorts while his younger brother Beau donned a white t-shirt teamed with salmon bottoms.

Posting it to her Instagram stories, Louise uploaded a sped-up video of the routine, which saw her skipping, squatting, and working out with a resistance band.  

'A morning skip and jump!' she captioned the snap.

Now back home from Spain, Louise shared a Boomerang clip of three suitcases as she joked about putting the washing on now she was back in her house.

And the star will have plenty of home time as she will have to quarantine for two weeks with her sons now they have returned. 

Louise's holiday comes hot on the heels of the news that her ex-husband Jamie has moved on with a new love, Swedish model Frida Andersson-Lourie.

The former footballer, 47, was photographed heading on a dog walk with the mother-of-four, 37, near his home in Surrey last week in pictures obtained by The Sun. 

It is thought to be Jamie's first confirmed relationship since his split from Louise, with whom he shares two sons, after 19 years of marriage.
