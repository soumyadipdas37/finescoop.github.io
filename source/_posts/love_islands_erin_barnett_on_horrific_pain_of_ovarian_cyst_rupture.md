Erin Barnett has spoken candidly in the past about her surgeries for issues relating to endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome.

On Sunday, the former Love Island star recalled how she dropped down to her knees in the shower on Monday when an ovarian cyst ruptured.

The 24-year-old shared a photo to Instagram of her severely bloated stomach, and recalled the 'horrific' pain as blood ran down the drain and her skin 'burned'.

'Monday I had a cyst rupture inside on my right ovary that was slowly growing,' Erin began her post.

'I've had a cyst rupture inside my left ovary before it was completely removed, so I was well aware what I was feeling Monday night was a cyst rupture.'

Erin recalled how she went into panic mode, knowing the pain that was forthcoming.

Dropping down to her knees in 'indescribable' pain, she went on to describe the 'pool of blood running down the drain' and her skin 'burning' from extreme bloating.

Decision: After taking painkillers and consulting her gynaecologist, Erin revealed how she made the decision to have her right ovary removed. While it will mean the end of cyst ruptures, the reality star said it won't cure her endometriosis. Pictured in a prior Instagram post 

'I screamed, cried and cried and cried times 100. I was rocking back and forth just crying,' the influencer said.

Surgery: In June, Erin revealed on Instagram how she underwent surgery after her right ovary and Fallopian tube had attached to her bowel

⁣'This time round my right ovary and Fallopian tube were completely stuck on the walls of my uterus and attaching itself to my bowels. Everything was rock hard stuck on each other. This is caused by adhesions and endometriosis mixed together, woo.'

Erin explained how she was in post-op recovery for over five hours as she woke up from surgery in excruciating pain.

Erin first discovered she had the debilitating disorder when she had a three-litre cyst removed from her ovary at the age of just 15.

'Everyone asking about my stomach tattoo. I got this tattoo to cover up scars on my stomach as I've had many ovary operations due to having endometriosis and polycystic ovaries,' she explained in 2019.

At the time, Erin also revealed that she can't have children naturally.

Endometriosis is present when the tissue that is similar to the lining of the uterus (womb) grows outside this layer and causes pain and/or infertility.

There are a wide variety of symptoms - pain can affect areas ranging from the abdomen and lower back to the pelvis and vagina. 

Other symptoms include painful sexual intercourse, abnormal menstruation, nausea, bloating, and pain with bowel movements.   

The only way that the diagnosis of endometriosis can be made is to undergo a laparoscopy and have a tissue sample taken.

There is no cure, but treatments such as hormones and excision surgery, are available.
