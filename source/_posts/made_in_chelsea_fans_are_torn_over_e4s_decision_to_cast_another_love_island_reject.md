Made In Chelsea returned on Monday night with a pair of new faces - one of which was Charlie Frederick from Love Island 2018.

And while some fans were wondering where they recognised him from, others cottoned on straight away that he is an ex-Love Island star - the second to join Made In Chelsea recently.

Charlie appeared on series 4 of the ITV2 dating show, similarly to Zara McDermott who joined MIC as Sam Thompson's girlfriend last year.



The pair didn't cross paths during their time in the Spanish villa, with Charlie evicted 13 days into the series and Zara entering two days later.

MIC fans weren't sure about the choice in casting - with some finding it hilarious and others more than happy to see the hunky blonde on their screens again.

'Confused. Is this the same Charlie from #loveisland?' one typed on Twitter, followed by another who wrote: 'Omg is that charlie from love island?'

'Is this Made in Chelsea or Love Island?' another posted.





A fourth penned: 'They're going to have to start calling it Love In Chelsea soon!' 

'Charlie from Love Island?!? lmao,' one viewer laughed, as did another who posted: 'Is the personal trainer from love island lmfao!'

Others merely rejoiced that the series was back on screens. 

'Mondays are good again now that MIC is back!' one posted. Another penned: 'Made in Chelsea is back. Something proper to read on my twitter feed instead of all the #corona b******s!'







'Sorry but seeing liv wip out that voice note was something I needed to lighten up my Monday night!' someone else posted, referring to the way the episode ended.

It saw Liv Bentley inform Zara that her supposed friend Melissa Tattam had sent Tiff Watson a voice note calling Zara a 'fame w***e'.

The fallout of this will take place next week.

Meanwhile, Charlie has been drafted in to spark up a romance with Liv, but seems to also have his eye on Verity Bowditch.

While he made an impression among the ladies of the show, Charlie didn't actually speak until 22 minutes into the episode.

Made In Chelsea airs Mondays at 9PM on E4.
