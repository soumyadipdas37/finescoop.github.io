Strictly Come Dancing 2010 champion Kara Tointon has admitted her winning performance was a 'car crash.'

The former EastEnders star, 37, confessed she was forced to dance through a painful arm injury she suffered during an earlier performance in the live final, which left her struggling to move.

Despite her injury, Kara went onto be crowned Strictly champion with her professional partner Artem Chigvintsev, and she is still renowned as one of the best contestants in the show's history.

'Upset': Strictly Come Dancing 2010 champion Kara Tointon has admitted her winning performance was a 'car crash' after injuring her arm during an earlier performance

Kara told The Mirror she still gets 'upset' when she thinks about her Strictly final performances, after being forced to dance both a Waltz and American Smooth with her injured arm  

She said: 'You are meant to get better every week, but I had quite a bad injury in the final the day before, I pulled some ligaments in my arm.

'On the day of the final, I was in quite a lot of pain. So my final dance was a bit of a car crash. It was just awful because I couldn't really move.

'When I watch it back, I cringe at the final. But all the other weeks I remember very fondly.'
