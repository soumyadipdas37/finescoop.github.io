Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden appeared loved up in a series of snaps taken in the countryside with her husband Prince Daniel.

The mother-of-two, 43, donned a check print shirt with navy trousers and a New Era cap for outdoorsy style and comfort as they journeyed between the mountains in Storulvån, Sylarna and Blåhammaren, before ending their trail back at Storulvån.

In one of the scenic snaps, the Swedish royals embrace each other with Prince Daniel wrapping an arm around Princess Victoria while standing in a location tagged on Instagram as Jämtlandstriangeln.

The couple praised the work of Svenska Turistföreningen for making Swedish nature available to everyone in the caption of their post 

Crown Princess Victoria swept her glossy brunette hair neatly into a ponytail and appeared to have opted for minimal makeup for the outing.

She completed her look with two-toned boots and a large hiking bag filled with supplies for their journey.

Meanwhile, Prince Daniel appeared equally style conscious in coordinating trousers, a green windbreaker jacket and a cap.

The Swedish royals shared two photos from their hike on Instagram, racking up almost 54,000 likes and a stream of comments from their over 462,000 followers.

'The hike went between the mountain stations Storulvån, Sylarna and Blåhammaren,  and then ended in Storulvån. 

'The Crown Princess couple would like to thank @stfturist for the work the association and its employees do to spread knowledge of the right to all and make Swedish nature available to everyone.' 

Many responses to the post dubbed the photographs as 'beautiful' and revealed they also enjoy outdoor activities.

Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, who married at at Stockholm Cathedral in 2010, are parents to Princess Estelle, eight, and Prince Oscar, four.   

The couple have been completing socially distanced engagements, since Sweden took a noticeably more low-key approach to fighting the coronavirus in comparison to other European countries.

They are set to have a busy week with a meeting scheduled with Swedish performing arts director and the Theater Association's theater and film association director in addition to a video chat with Sweden's governors.
