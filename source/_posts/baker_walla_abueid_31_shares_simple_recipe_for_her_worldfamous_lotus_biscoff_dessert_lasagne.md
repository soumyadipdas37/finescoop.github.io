When you think of lasagne, you are likely to picture stacks of pasta coated in a rich tomato sauce and lashings of melted cheese.

So perhaps it's no wonder that Sydney baker Walla Abu-Eid's reinvention of the classic Italian dinner as a decadent, cheesecake-style dessert has attracted widespread attention on social media.

So keen is the interest that the 31-year-old mother-of-three - whose cakes have garnered an Instagram following of 83,300 - has now revealed the simple recipe for her viral creation, which has been shared by more than 60 global news outlets.

In a video filmed for Instagram TV, Ms Abu-Eid - who learned to bake on Google and YouTube and says 'anyone can do the same' - showed viewers how to make their own with five ingredients: sugar, cream, vanilla extract, Lotus Biscoff spread and biscuits.

To make the filling, Ms Abu-Eid mixes a carton of thickened cream with a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of vanilla extract, whipping until 'soft peaks' form in the mixture.

It should be thick and slightly stiff without being over beaten, which causes the cream to curdle.

Next, she heats a jar of Biscoff spread in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften – and then gets down to assembling the dessert.

Ms Abu-Eid lines the base of a glass baking dish with Biscoff biscuits, then covers them with the sugar and cream mixture.

She drizzles some melted Biscoff spread over the cream, then repeats the process three times, ending with a layer of cream on top.

Scooping any remaining spread into a piping bag, she pipes thin lines onto the cream and runs through them with a skewer or toothpick, creating an ornate triangular pattern.

Finally, she crumbles leftover biscuits into fine crumbs and sprinkles them around the edge of the dish for decoration.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia in July, Ms Abu-Eid said her swift success on social media has been 'crazy'.

'People tell me my cakes look so professional, but I really just do it as a hobby whenever I have time,' she said.

Asked if she had secured a paid partnership with Lotus to promote the brand, the baker laughed and said a collaboration like that would be a dream come true.

'I wish I had a deal with Biscoff, I just love the flavour. I actually did contact them, but no word yet!' she said.

On the back of the extraordinary baking craze that's swept Australia and the rest of the world since the coronavirus crisis began, Ms Abu-Eid shared tips and tricks for first-timers looking to step into the kitchen.

Patience and practice are crucial, she says, but there's no need to enroll in expensive courses.

'I didn't go to any academy or take any classes, [I learned] from the internet - lots of Googling, reading blogs and watching YouTube,' she said.

'I'd look at clips over and over until I'd gotten everything I could from each one, then move on to the next.'

Ms Abu-Eid never lets herself run out of five staple ingredients - eggs, butter, sugar, flour and vanilla extract - which she says forms the base for almost every cake.

While she's content to keep baking as a much-loved hobby rather than a full-time business, Ms Abu-Eid hopes to pass her skills to at least one her three young daughters.

'My second girl Masa is very interested, she's always asking to help in the kitchen,' she said.

'We went to the toy store last weekend and she picked a baking set because she said she wants to be just like mum!'

Whether she follows in those footsteps remains to be seen, but it's clear that Masa and her sisters are exceptionally lucky to have a teacher as gifted as their mother.
