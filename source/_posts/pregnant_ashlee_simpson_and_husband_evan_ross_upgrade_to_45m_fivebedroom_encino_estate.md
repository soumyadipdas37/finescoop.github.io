As Ashlee Simpson and her second husband Evan Ross-Næss prepare to welcome her third child (his second) this fall, they decided to buy a larger home to make more room for their son.

The 35-year-old sister of Jessica Simpson and the 32-year-old son of Diana Ross purchased a 6,250-square-foot, .44-acre estate in Los Angeles' Encino neighborhood for $4.5M - according to The Dirt.

With stained hardwood floors and high ceilings, Ashlee and Evan's posh property is reportedly similar in design to the British exclusive members-only SoHo Club.

Wide Fleetwood doors open up to give the den an optional open-air vibe where it connects to the backyard terrace.

The married couple of six years will enjoy taking a dip in the large swimming pool and built-in spa with their blended brood.

The patio is ideal for dining al fresco, and it features a fire pit and adjoining poolhouse.
