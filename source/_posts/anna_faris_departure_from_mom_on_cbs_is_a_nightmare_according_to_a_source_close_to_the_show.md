Anna Faris shocked fans last week when she announced she was leaving her hit CBS sitcom Mom after seven seasons, with just days before production was set to begin on new episodes.

And while show producers wished the 43-year-old actress well in a statement after the news, it appears that the team behind the show is less than pleased over the shock development.

A source 'close to the show' spoke to People Magazine on Thursday, sharing 'it was a surprise to hear that Anna was leaving. None of us are happy about that.'

'It was sudden and unwelcome, and it left the entire network scrambling. This is not a good thing at all,' the source added. 

News of Faris's departure from the show broke late last week, and according to sources at the time, she chose to leave Mom in order to pursue other opportunities.

'Mom has been one of CBS's [sic] more profitable scripted shows, in a very challenging economic time,' the staffer told People on Thursday. 'And now one of the leads is gone. It's actually a nightmare. No one wanted this.'

'It was sudden and unwelcome, and it left the entire network scrambling. This is not a good thing at all,' the source said of future plans for the show

As the series co-lead opposite Oscar winner Allison Janney, Anna was part of the central DNA of Mom, playing reformed daughter Christy of a wild child mother, who is also mom to one of her own.

It remains to be seen how exactly the Chuck Lorre-created series will deal with Ana's absence, with production set to resume for the show's eighth season on Monday.

And according to sources at Deadline, Anna's departure was in fact finalized at an early point in the hiatus. 

Nonetheless, Anna's decision to leave became public just days before the show's originally scheduled start date, of September 8th.

On September 4th, the My Super Ex-Girlfriend actress released a statement about the move, obtained by Variety:

'I'm so thankful to Chuck, the writers, and my amazing castmates for creating a truly wonderful work experience. While my journey as Christy has come to an end, allowing me to pursue new opportunities, I'll be watching next season and rooting for my TV family.'

Warner Brothers Television, Chuck Lorre Productions, and CBS responded, with a statement of their own:

'From the inception of Mom, Anna was the first and only choice for the role of Christy' the missive read.

'We are so proud of the stories we have been able to tell during Anna's seven years with us. We wish Anna all the best, and we thank her for her beautiful portrayal.'

Mom's September 8th start date to shoot was since pushed to the 14th, due to coronavirus concerns.   

To date, there is just one other project listed on Anna's IMDb page – Summer Madness, a feature-length comedy currently in pre-production.

Mom debuted on CBS in 2012 and became a ratings and critical hit, with Allison receiving numerous awards for her work including an Emmy and Golden Globe.

Season three of the series holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where critics conceded: 'Mom continues to nurture the multi-cam sitcom genre with mature storytelling and wonderful performances by Anna Faris and Allison Janney, who both handle reflective drama with the same deft touch as they do comedic timing.'

Anna has previously expressed just how happy and grateful she was to be working on the show.

'For a comedy, the whole show feels rare and special. I'm just so grateful. Last year, I felt incredibly grateful, as well,' she told Collider in 2014. 'It was such an amazing feeling to even be going, but this year, it hit home even more. It's not common that people's shows get picked up these days, especially the comedies.
