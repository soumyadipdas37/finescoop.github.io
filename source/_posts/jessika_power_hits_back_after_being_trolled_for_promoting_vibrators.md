Jessika Power hasn't certainly never held back when it comes to discussing sex.

And on Monday, the blonde bombshell faced backlash after posing half naked on Instagram to promote a sex toy. 

With her hands covering her breasts and a huge smile on her face, the 29-year-old issued a strong statement about female empowerment. 

Bold statement: Jessika Power has been trolled after posing topless to promote vibrators on Instagram as an act of 'female empowerment' 

'The naked female body is treated so weirdly in society. It's like people are constantly begging to see it, but once they do, someone's a h**?' she wrote.

The star then shared a link to a sex toy company she was promoting, explaining that the company's aim was to 'update culture and reshape society'.

In a series of videos posted to her Instagram stories, Jessika opened up about the backlash she's received from promoting female pleasure products.

'The naked female body is treated so weirdly in society. It's like people are constantly begging to see it, but once they do, someone's a h**?' the former Married At First Sight star wrote

'I don't know why I get a little bit nervous when I start doing these videos,' she said.

'I think because people always have their own two cents to throw in when I do videos like this, "Oh here we go, Jessika Power's talking about vibrators again. Oh here we go, Jessika Power's trying to make it about empowering women and women don't need their vibrators to feel empowered",' she continued.

'You know what though? Sometimes women aren't allowed to express themselves sexually without being called a s**t, without being called dirty names or without having this stigma put on them.'

Despite the positivity behind her message, Jessika still faced backlash from some of her followers.

'I'm pretty sure you can deliver the same message your trying to preach with clothes on,' wrote one.

'It’s about being decent and classy not trashy,' snapped another.

However, the blonde bombshell also received some support, with her former Married At First Sight co-star Tamara Joy writing: 'Girl you rock this s**t damn.'

'You know what though? Sometimes women aren't allowed to express themselves sexually without being called a s**t,' she boldly told her followers

The sex toy company also commented, writing: 'Thank you Jess for being brave enough to voice the truth! The female body, your body, is the creator of life, and there's nothing more precious that. Proud to have you on Team Viva!'

Jessika has forged a successful career as an Instagram influencer since shooting to fame on MAFS early last year.

In addition to sex toys, she also promotes beauty products, fashion, bedding and more.
