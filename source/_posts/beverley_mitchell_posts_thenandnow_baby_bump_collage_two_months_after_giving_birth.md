Beverley Mitchell of 7th Heaven fame showed off her post-pregnancy weight loss on her Instagram page this Tuesday.

The actress posted a then-and-now collage of lingerie mirror selfies that showed her bump then her post-baby body. 

The 39-year-old welcomed her daughter Mayzel 'Mayzie' Josephine in mid-July with her husband Michael Cameron whom she married in 2008.

Her post was advertising a belly wrap which is meant to help with postpartum weight loss. 

In addition to their latest little bundle of joy Beverley and Michael share a daughter called Kenzie, seven, and a son called Hutton, five.

The birth of her youngest child came less than two years after Beverley suffered the heartbreak of miscarrying twins.

She also experienced a number of health problems during her latest pregnancy so she had to have a cesarean at 37 weeks to avoid potentially dangerous contractions.

Her 'thin uterine wall' meant doctors were 'fearful of me rupturing so they have to deliver me before I even get close to my due date. I’m actually not allowed to go into contractions or anything,' she told Us Weekly in June.

Shortly after Mayzie was born Beverley revealed to Us Weekly that she underwent 'a bit of a difficult recovery' from the C-section.

'We had complications in surgery. It’s just been slow and steady. I lost a lot of blood, but I had amazing doctors,' she said. 

'I was at a great hospital, and they took great care of me. It’s a slow and steady process to recover,' the TV star explained.

'In this time of chaos, it’s pretty, pretty amazing' that she was able to feel 'so safe and secure' while the cesarean was being performed, she said.
