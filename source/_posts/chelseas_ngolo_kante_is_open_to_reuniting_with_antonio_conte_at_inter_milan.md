Inter Milan are desperate to sign Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante this summer according to reports.

Antonio Conte won the Premier League with Kante, who is open to a move, at Chelsea and the Inter Milan boss believes the World Cup winner is the final piece of the jigsaw for his squad.

But according to Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter must sell some players to meet Chelsea's £46million asking price.

Chelsea have already rejected offers from Inter for Kante involving Christian Eriksen and Marcelo Brozovic.

The Italians want Kante, 28, to anchor their midfield this season and have made the Frenchman their primary target.

Chelsea, however, would rather sell Jorginho ahead of Kante and have no interest in either Eriksen or Brozovic.

Inter have a limited budget and will have to be creative in their offers as they look to streamline a vast squad.

Former Tottenham midfielder Eriksen has failed to have the desired impact since his £18m move last January and Inter are willing to offload him even though the Dane insisted this week he was happy in Italy.

Chelsea are well stocked in midfield themselves though would like to add a younger holding player with West Ham's Declan Rice and Lille's Boubakary Soumare among those fancied by Frank Lampard.

Jorginho, 28, is considered more expendable and, after their outlay this summer, Lampard recognises the club have to consider ways of balancing the books.
