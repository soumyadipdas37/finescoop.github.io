Camilla looked in high spirits as she was spotted leaving exclusive Mayfair private members' club Oswald's on Tuesday,

The Duchess of Cornwall, 73, put on a stylish display in a below-the-knee navy and white polka dot dress, which she paired with a nude-coloured handbag and matching shoes. 

She accessorised with a watch on her left hand, and completed her outfit with a pair of silver earrings and a necklace. 

The royal, who was spotted getting in the front of the car, which had a pillow on the seat so she could travel in comfort, was also seen carrying a Toast bag - presumably where she had been shopping earlier in the day.

Oswald’s, named after owner Robin Birley’s grandfather, is a club for both men and women - with a huge focus on wine.

The luxurious private members' club is thought to be the best for wine connoisseurs, where guests can either cellar their own wine, or buy in house, before enjoying them in the ground floor restaurant or on the small rear terrace.

Earlier in the day, Camilla went back to school in a bid to highlight child literacy.

Wearing a Fiona Clare dress and matching mask, the royal was greeted by year three students at Ivydale Primary School on their third day back in class and was even treated to a cheeky joke.

Prince Charles' wife, who has been the patron of the National Literacy Trust since 2010 seemed delighted to travel to the school in order to open its new library and launch the Trust's virtual library at Ivydale. 

Keeping her distance as to respect social distancing guidelines, and wearing a mask, she first met with school staff and teachers.  

Beaming youngsters eagerly pointed out their favourite books lining the shelves of a new school library funded entirely by parents.

The Duchess also recorded a secret message which will feature on the National Literacy Trust’s Virtual School Library, when it is launched online on Monday.
