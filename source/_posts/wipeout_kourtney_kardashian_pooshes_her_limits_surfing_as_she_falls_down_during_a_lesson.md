Kourtney Kardashian was learning how to surf over the weekend. 

The 41-year-old Poosh founder spent Sunday channeling her inner surfer girl as she took a lesson in Malibu with 19-year-old TikTok star Addison Rae as well as her longtime friend Courtney for a change of pace.  

The mother-of-three looked to be having the time of her life despite wiping out a couple times. Also seen was a surf instructor who looked on and gave her pointers.

For her lesson, Kourtney donned a black wetsuit with turquoise and blue patches. 

She kept her hair back in a bun, opting for a baseball cap to protect her skin from sun damage, appearing makeup free. 

Kourtney, who often comes off as the least adventurous of her sisters on TV, seemed to be stepping outside of her comfort zone for the day. 

The fitness aficionado seemed to maintain a good level of balance, but was also able to laugh at herself during the times she fell off the board.

Though she fell down a couple times, Kourtney had a close group of supportive friends around her that were all in the same boat. 

She remained incredibly determined throughout the lesson, as she tried to get her footing on the big white surfboard. 

At one point, Kourtney could be seen falling backwards as the surfboard slipped from under her feet, propelling her back into the ocean abyss. 

The eldest Kardashian popped up with a big grin on her face, though being absolutely soaked with salt water in her mouth.

After her day of expending energy, Kourtney and her pals exited the water to go change before grabbing a bite to eat at Nobu. 

As she got out of the water, the star looked un-amused as she roamed the public beach with the large board in tow, drained from a day of surfing.  

She chatted with her friend Courtney as they walked towards her black Range Rover, after working up an appetite in the water. 

Later in the day, Kourtney documented their time surfing on social media as she posted a photo of she and her friends on the beach in matching wetsuits.

Kourtney's quaffed hair soon fell victim to the big waves as she spent her day, in the ocean.   

Kourtney and Addison  got themselves together before having lunch with son Mason, 10, and his friends. 

The same day ex-partner Scott Disick, 37, was seen in Malibu with Penelope, eight, and Reign, five, as they enjoyed some beach fun of their own.

As beach lovers, the Kardashian family rented an $120M beachfront mansion during quarantine for a change of scenery. 

The house provides access to a private beach and a nice change from the more arid Calabasas climate, as the large family rotate spending time there. 

Recently, Kourtney just held her first virtual Poosh Wellness Festival on Saturday. The festival's mission aimed to provide 'immersive activities and engaging conversations within the wellness space.'

A few days ago, Kourtney spoke to WWD where she discussed Poosh and her push for clean eating - a movement especially in LA that has become more normalized. 

'It's frustrating to feel like it's kind of this weird thing to eat organically or things that to me are pretty standard in self-care, so I think now it's become normal in a way and I'm just happy that it's catching on' she shared.
