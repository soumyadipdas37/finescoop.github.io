Katie Price refused to let her broken feet get her down on Tuesday as she headed out for lunch with her boyfriend Carl Woods. 

The glamour model, 42, who is unable to walk while she recovers from her eight-hour surgery, was picked up and carried by Carl, 31, into the restaurant in Essex.

It comes after sources close to Katie said it 'wouldn't be a surprise' if they wed soon, after she took the car businessman's surname on a personalised number plate for her mobility scooter.

Despite her obvious setback, Katie maintained a glamorous appearance with her full face of make-up, poker straight hair and silk navy top. 

She teamed the look with ripped denim jeans, while the boot casts went up to below the knee. 

Carl, meanwhile, was casually-clad in a black T-shirt, jeans and trainers. 

Mwah! The couple couldn't keep their hands off each other as they sat down for an alfresco lunch and were pictured passionately kissing

Their outing comes as Katie took to Instagram stories after being mocked by fans for mispronouncing Carl's name. 

Poking fun at herself, the mother-of-five said: So many people keep on saying that I call Carl C-A-R-L "Cole," when I know I should be saying Carl.

'I just can't say Carl, Carl come upstairs, Carl. I just say Cole. I'm trying to tell Cole to watch my story. Carl, can you watch my story?'

The camera then panned over to the former Love Island question who swore.  

The television personality reportedly calls herself 'Katie Woods' after just three months of dating Carl.

According to a source, the glamour model has already splashed out on a K WOODS number plate for her scooter and new car.

'She's even getting a number plate calling her K WOODS to go on new car and scooter next week.

'Nobody would be surprised if they were married by the end of the year.'

MailOnline has contacted Katie Price's representatives for comment.  

The glamour model has been dating former Love Island star Carl for three months, yet things have moved very quickly between the pair.
