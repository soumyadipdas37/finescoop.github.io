Married At First Sight star Stacey Hampton has never been shy in flaunting her enviable curves, and her love for contemporary high-end fashion.

And on Friday, the 26-year-old drew attention to her eye-popping cleavage in a racy white lace corset, in a photo shared to Instagram.

The entrepreneur teamed the Dion Lee undergarment with black track pants, but ensured her hair and makeup was ultra glamorous.

Her brunette tresses were styled sleek and straight, and her striking facial features were enhanced with bold brows, a bronzed complexion and a touch of blush.

'Mixing dressy corsets with casual track pants and white kicks, iconic,' Stacey captioned the post. 

Earlier this month, Stacey launched a new business where fans can rent out her distinctive garb.   

Sharing the news to Instagram, the one-time reality star revealed items available range from dresses to blazers and bags, from the likes of Chanel, Balmain and Gucci.

Want to look like Stacey? Earlier this month, the entrepreneur revealed she's now hiring out her designer wardrobe to fans - with labels including Chanel and Balmain

'I'm in the process of actually getting all of my designer clothes and dresses and outfits ready to be hired out,' Stacey told fans in an Instagram Story clip at the time.

The mother-of-two encouraged her fans to ask for specific items they're after, which she will happily buy and make available for hire.

'So if there's a Fendi dress that you're interested in and you can't quite get your hands on it, and if you want to loan it out, I'm happy to buy some items to add to the collection,' she said from inside her luxury vehicle.

For now, the business will solely run out of Adelaide, where Stacey is based, so she can avoid shipping amid the coronavirus pandemic.   

A black Balmain tweed blazer, retailing for $3030, can cost the average person $500 to hire, while a simple black Balmain T-shirt is available to rent for $60.

Chanel drop earrings cost $200 to hire, while for the same price you could also rent out a pink monogrammed Louis Vuitton scarf.
