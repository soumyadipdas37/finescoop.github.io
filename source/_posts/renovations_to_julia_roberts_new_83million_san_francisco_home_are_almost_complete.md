Julia Roberts' new San Francisco home is near completion – and neighbors say the star and her family will fit in perfectly.

The Oscar winner, 52, and her husband Danny Moder, 51, bought the home in the city's upmarket Presidio Heights neighborhood for $8.3million in January last year.

Work is still going on to renovate the stunning century-old Victorian property but appears to be winding down, as exclusive DailyMail.com photos show.

Residents in the area - which is favored by wealthy Silicon Valley businessmen - said they are excited to welcome Hollywood royalty and her brood of two sons and a daughter to the neighborhood.

The home features an office, wet bar, wood-paneled wine cellar, remodeled kitchen and bathrooms, a carpeted grand staircase and stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge

'The street is chock full of successful people from the worlds of finance and tech, CEOs and owners of massive companies who have houses in Napa and Sonoma and Europe but this is where their kids go to school,' one neighbor said 

One next-door neighbor who gave her name as Marty said: 'This is the kind of place where Julia will fit in and be comfortable.

'I think that's why she's invested here, it's a place where she can be a person, a mom, a wife.

'It's a beautiful house with great views but it's modest, it's perfect for people who want to just blend in and have a quiet life to raise three children.

'The places to hang out are the Presidio, which is great for hiking, and Sacramento Street, our little shopping street.

'There are no bars but lots of restaurants, clothing shops, art shops, designer shops.

'She will be able to go there without being bothered.'

Roberts and her husband, cinematographer Danny Moder, 51, purchased the property in January 2019 and is expected to relocate full-time to the Golden Gate City in the near future

Another neighbor living opposite, who gave his name as Pat, said: 'We've just moved so this is the first I'm hearing about it.

'That's really cool that she'll be across the street.

'Do you think she's going to be excited about being neighbors with me?

'It's a lot of dough that she spent buying the place although maybe not so much for her.

'It's probably like 15 minutes of a movie for her.'

The 6,245 squat feet home has a painted shingled facade and comes with five bedrooms and four and one half bathrooms spread across five floors.

It also features an office, wet bar, wood-paneled wine cellar, remodeled kitchen and bathrooms, a carpeted grand staircase and stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge.
