A disrespectful teenager has been shared footage online showing him jumping and spitting on supercars on display inside a shopping centre.  

A video posted to Instagram on Tuesday shows the youth riding a scooter through Townsville's Stockland, in northeast Queensland, before entering a roped-off exhibit. 

'Hurry up, go,' a friend filming can be heard saying, as the teenager jumps over the barrier.

The boy climbs on to the bonnet of an orange McLaren then jumps across on to the front of an adjacent Ferrari. 

After spitting on the red luxury sports car, the teen lunges off off the bonnet and the pair run away. 

The cars, worth around $500,000, could be heard crunching beneath the teenager's weight as he bounced on the hoods. 

The clip was also shared on Facebook, alongside the caption: 'Yes that's a McLaren and a Ferrari and yes I spat on and put a dent on it [sic]'. 

Friends commenting on post appeared to find the incident funny, with several using the laughing emoji.   

'Bruh townsvilles just a joke [sic],' one person wrote.

Another added: 'Rip those cars'.

The cars were stationed in the centre for a travel package promotion in the Gold Coast, which involve joy rides in super cars, Townsville Bulletin reports.   

The matter has been reported to police and an investigation is now underway.
