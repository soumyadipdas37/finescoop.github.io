Melbourne is the only city in Australia that has not returned to normal levels of traffic on the roads because of its harsh COVID-19 lockdown, new data reveals.

Foot and car traffic significantly plunged in all Australian cities in March as COVID-19 restrictions came were introduced.

Apple Data, which tracks mobility trends around the world, revealed only in the past two months have drivers slowly returned to the roads with restrictions now softened.

By June, most cities recorded a return to normalcy on the roads - cities like Perth and Brisbane had even higher numbers of cars on the roads compared to pre COVID-19.

Predictably, Melbourne has the worst figures in the country with its September numbers well below average and just as bad as they were seven months ago.

Public transport has been the worst hit with 85 per cent less commuters catching a train or bus while 65 per cent less drivers are on the roads. 

The city has been locked in Stage Four restrictions since August with residents not allowed to leave their homes after 8pm and only one person allowed to shop for each household.  

Melbourne

Car and foot traffic and public transport figures drastically descended in mid March and reached the lowest figures in April.

Public transportation fell by a staggering 90 per cent while car and foot traffic dropped by 80 per cent.

More drivers slowly returned to the roads over the coming months as restrictions were softened in the states (pictured, drivers slowly returned to the roads in Sydney in June)

All three modes of transport looked to be on the mend and the number of cars on the road almost returned to normal in June.

Though the figures slowly plunged again with the biggest drops recorded around the time stage four lockdown restrictions were introduced at Melbourne and Mitchell Shire in August.  

Photos from around the same time showed eerily empty freeways and streets with residents forced to stay in their homes during certain hours of the day. 

In September, buses and train drivers are transporting 85 per cent less commuters. 

Sixty-five per cent less drivers are taking to the roads while 58 per cent less people are walking.
