Dacre Montgomery was spotted working on the set of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic in Queensland on Thursday, one week after it was announced he'd be joining the cast. 

The Australian actor, 25, wore a casual white T-shirt, blue jeans and brown buttoned shirt as he filmed scenes in a car park.

Dacre, best known for playing Billy Hargrove in Stranger Things, completed his outfit with sunglasses and a pair of white sneakers as he worked on the set.

The musical drama details the life of legendary rockstar Elvis Presley, with American actor Austin Butler set to star as the icon.

Tom Hanks will star as Elvis' notorious manager, Colonel Tom Parker, while Australian actress Olivia DeJonge will feature as Priscilla Presley. 

Production was forced to shut down in March after Tom, 64, and his wife of 32 years, Rita Wilson, both contracted coronavirus.

On Wednesday, filming for the new biopic resumed, six months after it was forced to close.

In a statement, Baz, 57, said he was looking forward to finally getting back to work on the blockbuster. 

'We're back to, as Elvis liked to say, "taking care of business!"' he began.

'It is a real privilege in this unprecedented global moment that Tom Hanks has been able to return to Australia to join Austin Butler and all of our extraordinary cast and crew to commence production on "Elvis".

'I cannot emphasise enough how lucky we feel in the current climate that the state of Queensland, and Queenslanders in general, have been so supportive of this film.'

The director also said he hoped to 'be an example [of] how creativity and productivity can proceed safely and responsibly in a way that protects our team and the community at large'.
