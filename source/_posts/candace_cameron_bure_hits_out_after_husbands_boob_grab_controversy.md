Candace Cameron Bure has called out her 'Christian' Instagram followers for deeming a picture of her husband of 24 years touching her breast 'inappropriate.'  

The 44-year-old Fuller House star had shared a touchy-feely snapshot of her husband Val Bure posing with his hand resting firmly on her boob, but she promptly deleted it after facing backlash.   

'For all of the Christians that are questioning my post with my husband's hand on my boob — my husband of 24 years — thinking it was inappropriate, it makes me laugh because it's my husband. We have so much fun together,' she responded in a series of videos shared on her Instagram Stories.

Hitting back: Candace Cameron Bure, 44, has defended her photo of her husband Vale Bure, 46, touching her breast after her some of her 'Christian' followers deemed it 'inappropriate' 

Cheeky: In the snapshot, Val has his arm wrapped around Candace's shoulder, with his hand resting on, and possibly even grabbing, her breast

'He can touch me any time he wants, and I hope he does,' she continued. 'This is what a healthy, good marriage and relationship is all about.' 

Candace noted that 'most' of her fans loved the cheeky post, which she had shared with Val's 'permission.' She started to apologize to those who were displeased, but then swiftly took it back.  

'I'm sorry if it offended you — I'm actually not sorry,' she said with a laugh. 'I'm glad we have fun together after so many years. He can touch me all day long.' 

The mother of three also reposted the image in question as a 'refresher' for those who weren't sure which picture she was referencing. 

The photo shows Candace and Val standing on a wooden bridge together. He has his arm wrapped around her shoulder, with his hand resting on, and possibly even grabbing, her breast. 

Not having it: The Fuller House star stressed that Val has been her 'husband of 24 years' and she finds it laughable that people would take offense to the playful photo

Look of love: Candace said Val can touch her 'any time he wants,' noting that 'this is what a healthy, good marriage and relationship is all about'

'Classic Val,' she wrote. 'He approved this post.'

Val, 46, is rarely seen on her Instagram page, and she has taken to calling him 'unicorn' because of his reluctance to appear in photos.  

In April, she asked Val to appear in one of her videos as her birthday wish. He obliged and gave her a sweet on-camera kiss. 

Last week, the Hallmark Christmas movie queen posted a snapshot of herself at a miniature golf course with Vale during a romantic getaway. 

'Praise the Lord for a good husband! Val (the unicorn) snuck me away for a few nights and we had a much needed gloriously beautiful stay-cation,' she captioned the image. 'And now... back to the grind (that I also love).' 

Camera shy: Candace calls Val 'unicorn' because he rarely appears in her photos. In April, she asked him to be in one of he videos as a birthday wish. He gave her a sweet kiss in the clip 

Party of five: Candace and Val have a daughter Natasha (not pictured) and sons Lev (far left) and Maksim (far right)

Young love: The couple has a wedding to plan now that Lev, 20, is engaged. He proposed to his girlfriend Taylor Hutchison in late August 

Candace married the retired NHL pro back in June of 1996, and they share a daughter Natasha, 22, and sons Lev, 20, and Maksim, 18. 

She was just 20 when she said 'I do,' and her eldest son Lev is following in her footsteps after proposing to his girlfriend Taylor Hutchison in late August. 

The proud mom announced the happy news on Instagram, sharing a photo of Lev down on one knee. She later posted a video montage of her son's engagement dinner — and it seems she already had grandchildren on her mind. 

'My family is my everything. I am SO happy for the Hutchisons and the Bures to become family too!' she wrote in the caption. 

'Taylor, I promise to be the best mother-in-love you could hope. I’ll only get annoying when it comes to my time with future grandbabies.'
