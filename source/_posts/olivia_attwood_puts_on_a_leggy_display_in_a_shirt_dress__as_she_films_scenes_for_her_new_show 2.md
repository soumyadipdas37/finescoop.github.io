ITV have commissioned her an eight-part series which will follow her planning her wedding to footballer fiancé Bradley Dack.

And Olivia Attwood appeared in high spirits as she filmed scenes for the new reality show, Meets Her Match, in Manchester on Tuesday. 

The reality star, 29, who rose to fame on the 2017 edition of Love Island, turned heads in a white shirt dress which showcased her tanned legs.

Olivia paired the thigh-skimming number with a lilac oversized jumper which sheathed over her slender frame.

The television personality, who also stars on TOWIE and will appear in the upcoming 10th anniversary series, added a boost to her height with white PVC ankle boots. 

Olivia amped up the glamour with a red Chanel handbag and wore her blonde locks in a voluminous curly blow-dry.

Olivia beamed as she strutted around the city centre ahead of filming. 

The former grid girl recently announced her new reality TV show, called Meets Her Match, which will air on ITVBe this autumn.

The eight-episode series will follow Olivia and her Blackburn Rovers footballer fiancé Bradley, as they plan their wedding and buy their first home in Cheshire.

The couple got engaged in Dubai last year and the programme will document their relationship as they prepare to take it the next level, with the Love Island star planning her dream wedding. 

Olivia previously had her own reality show with ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes called Crackin' On.

However, their relationship took a turn for the worse when Chris, 27, broke up with her on camera, telling her the relationship wasn't making him happy anymore.

He said to her at the time: 'I love you, I always will. You know that, nothing doubts that. You can't kid yourself.'

Olivia then reunited with Bradley, whom she was with before Love Island, while Chris found love with his now ex-girlfriend Jesy Nelson.
