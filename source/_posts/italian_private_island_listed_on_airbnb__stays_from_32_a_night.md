Anna Sarzetto, who transformed her grandmother's home into the holiday rental with the help of her family, recently started a farm on the island with artichokes, tomatoes and chicken's eggs among the harvest. 

The Sarzettos also cultivate honey and oysters and catch seafood from the lagoon, so guests can enjoy the true Venetian experience.

Anna told MailOnline Travel: 'All of our products are biological and we have won a prize for our honey because of its unique flavour. The taste comes from plants that only live in the lagoon.'

Anna added: 'We started to rent the island three years ago and everyone who stays is helping to save the island.

'Most of our guests come from northern Europe and Italy, but we have had guests from everywhere.

'It's like travelling the world from your home. We have met so many people with different stories. They teach me to see the island from many points of view.

'For me and my boyfriend this is not a job but a dream come true.'
