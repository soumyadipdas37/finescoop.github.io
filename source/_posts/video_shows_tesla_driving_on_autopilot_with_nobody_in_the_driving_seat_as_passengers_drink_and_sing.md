A TikTok video has emerged of a Tesla car driving down a California highway on autopilot with nobody in the driving seat as four passengers drink cans of seltzer and sing along to Justin Bieber. 

The shocking footage, posted on the TikTok account @BlurrBlake, shows three young men - alongside the unknown person behind the camera - partying inside the vehicle as it flies down the highway., 

The video begins by showing the driver's seat empty of a human driver and a can of seltzer lying on the dashboard as the car accelerates along the road. 

Music blasts through the speakers while a caption across the video reads: 'When your car is a better driver than you'.

A TikTok video has emerged of a Tesla car driving down a California highway on autopilot with nobody in the driving seat as four passengers drink and sing along to Justin Bieber

The footage, posted on the TikTok account @BlurrBlake, shows three young men - alongside the unknown cameraperson - partying inside the vehicle as it flies down the highway  

The footage pans out to show one male sat in the passenger seat dancing and singing along to the music. 

Next to him in the gap between the driver and passenger seats are cans of seltzer. 

The camera then pans round to two males in the backseat singing and bobbing along to the song.  

One is sporting sunglasses that are skewed across his face while he clutches a can while the other dons a mask and sunglasses. 

The camera then pans back round to the front as the men start singing along to the chorus of Bieber's classic hit 'Baby'. 

The car allegedly reaches speeds of 60 mph all the while with no human driver ready to take over the vehicle, reported TMZ. 

As per Tesla's website, the vehicle's autopilot system must be used 'with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment'.  

The group's antics come after there have been several fatal crashes and even more close calls when using the autopilot systems on Tesla's so-called driverless cars. 

A federal probe was launched after a 12th Tesla crash in December was believed to be tied to the carmaker's autopilot system.

The technology has been connected to four fatal accidents.

In March 2019, Florida driver Jeremy Banner, 50, died when his Tesla Model 3 slammed into a trailer truck.

National Transportation Safety Board investigators said Banner turned on the autopilot feature about 10 seconds before the crash, and the autopilot did not execute any evasive maneuvers to avoid the collision.

Three other fatal crashes date back to 2016. 

Despite the issues with the tech, controversial Tesla founder Elon Musk announced in July the company is 'very close' to achieving complete autonomous driving technology.

'I'm extremely confident that level 5 or essentially complete autonomy will happen and I think will happen very quickly,' Musk said.

'I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality for level 5 autonomy complete this year.'
