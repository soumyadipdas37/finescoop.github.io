A landlord has been mocked for advertising a cramped London flat with a shower in the kitchen to rent for £1,000-a-month. 

The one-bedroom property, located in Stoke Newington, features a strange bathroom with a mish-mash of fittings and a cramped living space complete with a shower cubicle. 

The flat, listed on Zoopla, was spotted by Vice writer Joel Golby, who shared a link on Twitter. 

Followers were quick to respond and share their theories on how the flat ended up the way it did, with one saying it was a conversion gone wrong. 

A landlord in London has been accused of trying to turn a bathroom into a flat, after listing a one bedroom property on Zoopla for £1,000 a month. Pictured, the 'kitchen' with shower

Twitter users were left horrified by the design of the property and took to Twitter to share their views 

One tweeted: 'Why does this look like the first house you build on Sims with £10,000?' 

Another posted: 'You should never be able to see your fridge and microwave while you shower.' 

A third added: 'All these years, there's me thinking there's nothing worse than those old houses that have a downstairs bathroom you have to walk through the kitchen to get to. What was I thinking!!!!' 

A snap taken of the bedroom shows part of the space has been tiled and a kitchen cabinet has been provided for storage 

One photo shows a range of amenities placed throughout that makes it questionable if the room is a kitchen, bathroom or lounge 

The flat has had almost 2,000 views since it was listed in August and has reduced it's price twice according to Zoopla. 

Originally advertised for £1,200, the landlord strategically placed amenities to reassure potential tenants that the property is able to meet all of their needs.

A photograph of the kitchen shows a shower cubicle and bathroom sink, next to a kitchen sink with two hobs and a series of shelves.

In the absence of an oven, the landlord placed a microwave on top of a chest of drawers and squeezed a fridge in the spot beside the dining table.

The tight space also features a sofa, which appears to be resting on a radiator. 

Meanwhile, the bathroom houses a washing machine alongside a toilet, sink and dated bath tub.   







A stream of Twitter users agreed with Joel that the property should be blasted for having a shower in the kitchen
