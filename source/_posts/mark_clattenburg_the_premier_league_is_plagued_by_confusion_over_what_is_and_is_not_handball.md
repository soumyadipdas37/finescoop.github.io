Sportsmail columnist Mark Clattenburg gives his view on the controversy surrounding the current handball law. 

Mike Riley must sort out the handball confusion now

The Premier League is plagued by confusion over what is and is not a handball, and the PGMOL should be doing something about it.

Their chief, Mike Riley, needs to explain to managers, players, media and fans what will lead to a penalty. He must explain why Manchester United’s Victor Lindelof was penalised for handball when no one in a Crystal Palace shirt even appealed.

Explain why Arsenal’s Gabriel was not penalised against West Ham for something similar.

Explain why a penalty can be awarded to Southampton for Matt Doherty handling the ball after it deflected off Tottenham team-mate Harry Winks’s foot.

Until he does that, coaches will continue to complain, players will look perplexed on the pitch, and fans will be frustrated. We cannot have that.

Mike Riley must tell managers and players what will lead to a penalty in the case of handball

Matt Doherty fell foul of IFAB and FIFA rule but I didn't agree with the penalty given against Victor Lindelof 

In the case of Doherty, the interpretations on handball given by IFAB and FIFA state it is an offence if a player handles the ball when making his body ‘unnaturally bigger’ unless he is making a deliberate action to play the ball.

Doherty fell foul of that. His arm was outstretched when the ball ricocheted against it. You may counter that it came off Winks’s foot and he had insufficient time to react. That doesn’t matter, because the laws state it is applicable even if the ball comes ‘directly from the head or body of another player who is close’.

I didn’t agree with the penalty given against Lindelof. Martin Atkinson awarded the kick after watching the incident on his pitch-side monitor. 

But in real time it was clear Lindelof’s hand movement was natural as he was in a running motion.
