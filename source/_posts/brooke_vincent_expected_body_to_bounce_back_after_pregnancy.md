 Brooke Vincent has confessed she was shocked when she did not snap back into shape after giving birth to her son Mexx last year.

After welcoming the baby in October with footballer Kean Bryan, the Coronation Street legend, 28, who has appeared on the soap since she was 11, admitted she was expecting to shed weight quickly yet was shocked at the outcome. 

Appearing alongside the tot on Monday's Loose Women, Brooke made the candid confession about her body and her changing shape - something she had previously touched on in a widely-praised Instagram. 

Changing shapes: Brooke Vincent has confessed she was shocked when she did not snap back into shape after giving birth to her son Mexx last year

After welcoming Mexx last year, she confessed that after his arrival she was not expecting her body to change in the way it did. 

She said: 'A lot of my friends had children in the past and it's just one of those things that wasn't spoken about, you didn't know you have a baby then however long to get back into your jeans... 

'Katy Perry put something on Instagram this morning five days after giving birthday. You just presume your stomach is going to go down because the baby is out and not inside you'.

She confessed of her pregnancy diet: 'I have a few months of Deliveroo still knocking about for not bouncing back, one of those things i wasn't really aware of'.

Talk then turned to an Instagram post shared in November in which she detailed the pressures of motherhood in a candid message.

She admitted she was in tears as she struggled to fit into 23 of her pre-pregnancy outfits while planning to have her 'first cocktail in 11 months' with her partner, 22. 

The Manchester native started off her note by revealing she was gearing up to enjoy her first date night since giving birth to Mexx, but opted to stay at home as she felt like a 'completely different person'.

Brooke explained: 'Tonight I was supposed to look completely different, I was supposed to be dressed up, hair and make up done ready to eat some nice food and maybe have my first cocktail in 11 months with Kean. 

'Our first time away from Mexx for an hour or two, instead I look like this. I look like this because I naively thought that 4 weeks after my baby I would be in all my old clothes looking exactly like I did before I got pregnant.' [sic]

The thespian confessed she was 'ashamed' as she struggled to fit into nearly two dozen of her old clothes, before comparing herself to fellow working mothers.

Struggling: Discussing the post on the show, she said: 'I'm still struggling to breathe in these jeans they are so tight! When I posted that picture, me and my boyfriend were going out for couple hours without Mexx'

'I thought I've got clothes now, I can pop my self back into clothes, it wasn't the case. even baggy stuff wasn't baggy, my waist had changed. When I put them on Insta it's after I've doubted with them in my own head... 

'I didn't put the post up for people to say you look mailing, it's to understand, must be so normal as never spoke about'. 

'I look like a completely different person': She has been refreshingly honest
