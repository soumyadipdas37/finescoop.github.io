She's the former Married At First Sight star who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Neil Goldsmith this year. 

And on Sunday, Carly Bowyer, 34, revealed the sex of her unborn baby on Instagram. 

The former reality TV star let fans know she is expecting a boy with her holding up a blue balloon arrangement saying 'BABY'.

Boy or girl? Married At First Sight star Carly Bowyer, 34, (L) revealed the sex of her baby with a smash cake alongside boyfriend Neil Goldsmith (R) on Instagram on Sunday 

The Melbourne-based beauty shared a short clip of herself hammering a white chocolate smash cake, with it revealing blue filling. 

'It's a .... boy!' she could be heard saying in the clip, while vigorously smashing the cake open. 

'It's a boy! We're going to have a little baby Neil running around very soon. We are so excited to meet our little biscuit boy... not long to go.' 

Carly has been busy documenting her pregnancy experience. She told Nine Now that she already knew she was pregnant before taking the test.    

 Mother's instinct kicking in? Carly revealed how she already knew she was pregnant before taking a test last month

'I knew that I was pregnant before I even missed my period and took a pregnancy test, it was really weird,' she said in August. 

She claimed she had noticed her body was subtly changing, and also had a hunch about the gender of her child.

But Carly admitted that her intuition about the baby's sex was actually wrong.

She explained that her doctor accidentally revealed her child's gender during a routine scan, and it was the opposite of what she and Neil were expecting.    

Wasn't expecting that! Carly also revealed she had experienced bizarre symptoms during the early months of her pregnancy - namely constipation while speaking to Nine Now previously

'I was just in pure shock. Not because of disappointment, but just because of surprise,' she said. 

She also revealed she had experienced bizarre symptoms during the early months of her pregnancy - namely constipation.   

'I wasn't expecting being constipated for the first three months. Apparently it is quite common, but it's one of those things that maybe the pregnant women aren't talking about,' she said. 

Carly first announced her pregnancy in June. 

Fans will remember Carly from the 2018 season of Married At First Sight. 

She was partnered with ice cream entrepreneur Justin Fischer and later dated another groom, Troy Delmege, for several months. 

Baby on board! Carly first announced her pregnancy in June. She shared a post to Instagram of herself and boyfriend Neil Goldsmith holding an ultrasound scan, and wrote: 'In what's been a crazy 2020, we see a little baby light at the end of the tunnel. We're over the moon'
