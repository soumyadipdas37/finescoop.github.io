A mother has restored an old dirt-encrusted oven to near perfect condition with budget supermarket sprays and a simple solution of lemon and baking soda.

Posting anonymously in a cleaning group on Facebook, the woman revealed she had inherited the vintage oven from her partner's grandmother and became determined to return it to its original glory before moving into a new home in October.

Photos illustrate the impressive result of her efforts, which have transformed the squalid interior of the appliance to a sparkling clean, usable condition.

First, she wiped $8.45 Oven Power cleaner over the filthy racks, then rubbed baking soda and lemon juice on the grease-stained glass - but her homemade mixture only lifted the first layer of build-up.

After inheriting the dirt-encrusted vintage oven (pictured left) from her partner's grandmother, the woman restored it to almost perfect condition (right) with supermarket sprays and a simple solution of lemon and baking soda

Alone, lemon and baking soda have many benefits.

Lemon is a potent antibacterial and its fresh, citrus scent leaves a clean smell without the toxic fumes found in commercial cleaning products. 

Baking soda is a drawing agent that pulls out stains and odours as well as being a natural grit that provides friction for scrubbing.

Together, they make a powerful solution perfect for lifting stains and killing germs in the kitchen and bathroom.

Undeterred, she sprayed $3.50 Easy-Off 'Bam' cleaner onto the glass which removed 'a fair bit' of dirt.

That left the grease stuck to the roof of the oven and 'a few stubborn spots' on the walls and base that haven't budged, despite vigorous scrubbing.

The mother said she hopes a third and final clean will restore the oven to functional condition, and asked for advice on scouring off the remaining stains. 

Many recommended dissolving a dishwasher tablet in warm water and scrubbing the solution inside the oven with a damp cloth.

Other suggestions included the $8 all-purpose cleaner 'Bar Keepers Friend' and $3 Magic Eraser, a spot cleaner that's gained cult status in Australia in recent years.

'Make a paste with Bar Keepers Friend and water. I heat the oven up to 120°C for half an hour, then layer the paste on and let it sit until the oven cools down,' one woman said. 'A little scrub and everything comes off very easily. It's great!'

Another had three words to offer: 'Hire a professional.'

Others were amazed that the decades old oven was still in working order.

'Wow! Look at that vintage beauty! Sorry, no suggestions, am just amazed that it's still cranking on after all these years...they sure don't make to last like that anymore!' one woman replied.

'I don't have a suggestion but I was blown away to see my old oven. For the record, it should still cook up a storm so enjoy your new home,' said a second.

It's the latest set of household cleaning photos to become a viral sensation on social media, following a mother's August post about $7.50 Fairy 'Lemon Easy Spray' which left her oven door sparkling clean.

The woman posted anonymously in a community group on Facebook, telling members how she coated the grime-riddled glass with the non-toxic spray, then scrubbed with a sponge for just under two minutes.

Photos prove the dark grease lifted off easily, leaving the door gleaming with just a few spritzes of the product which is available from leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.

The woman said she 'can't believe' she has finally found a product that lifts stains quickly and easily without the toxic fumes typically associated with effective oven cleaners.

The post quickly racked up hundreds of 'likes' and comments from impressed Australians, with many hailing the result the best they've seen.

One said: 'Wow, seeing is believing! I need to buy this.' 

A second added: 'Getting this as soon as possible. I cleaned my oven a couple of weeks ago it was a nightmare.'

A third said the spray had done 'exactly the same' to her oven door and she never plans to clean it with anything else.

A fourth said she also sprays it on her shower door, leaving the glass brighter and cleaner than ever before.
