The end is near for The CW's Supergirl TV series.

The network and Supergirl's producers Warner Bros. TV and Berlanti Productions announced on Tuesday that the series will end after airing its upcoming sixth season.

Filming on the season has been delayed so far due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and lead actress Melissa Benoist's pregnancy, so the show isn't expected to return until 2021.

Production is set to resume later this month on September 28, and writers are already at work on new storylines for the 20-episode final season, according to Variety.

The series will initially have to film around Benoist, 31, due to her pregnancy, and the producers are still trying to strike a deal with local unions in Vancouver to follow the Screen Actors Guild's coronavirus testing requirement, Deadline reported.

Benoist was reportedly in agreement with the producers and The CW that it would be best for Supergirl to conclude with a larger final season after years of declining ratings.

The title star took to Instagram after the news was announced with a behind-the-scenes photo of herself in costume while singing Supergirl's praises.

Life changing: Benoist shared a heartfelt message on Instagram after the news was announced. '[Supergirl] has changed my life for the better, and I'm forever grateful,' she wrote

'To say it has been an honor portraying this iconic character would be a massive understatement. Seeing the incredible impact the show has had on young girls around the world has always left me humbled and speechless,' the actress began.

'She’s had that impact on me, too. She’s taught me strength I didn’t know I had, to find hope in the darkest of places, and that we are stronger when we’re united. What she stands for pushes all of us to be better. She has changed my life for the better, and I’m forever grateful.

'I’m so excited that we get to plan our conclusion to this amazing journey, and I cannot wait for you to see what we have in store. I promise we’re going to make it one helluva final season.'

Benoist signed off with the Kryptonian phrase 'el mayarah,' which was translated as 'stronger together' on the second episode of the first season. 

Change of plans: Supergirl began its run on CBS in 2015, but the series was moved to the CW beginning with its second season, where it has remained since. It's part of The CW's connected Arrowverse

Supergirl began its run on CBS in 2015, but the series was moved to the CW beginning with its second season, where it has remained since.

Benoist starred as the Kryptonian Kara Zor-El, who goes by Kara Danvers on Earth and is the cousin of the more famous Superman.

Although the show started on a different network, it was the third entry in the CW's Arrowverse, a group of connected DC Comics shows that were inaugurated with Arrow in 2012.

Since then, The Flash, Legends Of Tomorrow, Batwoman and Black Lightning have all been added to the fold and featured in crossover events.

Next year, the spin-off Superman & Lois will premiere on The CW, featuring Tyler Hoechlin, who made multiple appearances on Supergirl.

Baby on board: Benoist announced in March tat she and her husband Chris Wood were expecting their first child together. They married in September 2019; shown in December 2019

On March 4 of this year, Benoist announced on Instagram with her Chris Wood that they were expecting their first child together.

The couple previously announced their engagement in February 2019, before tying the knot in September of that year.

Prior to starring in Supergirl, she was best known for her main cast role of Marley Rose on Glee.

She rose to prominence in 2014 with one of her first major film roles as the girlfriend of Miles Teller's character in the musical drama Whiplash, which was helmed by future La La Land director Damien Chazelle.
