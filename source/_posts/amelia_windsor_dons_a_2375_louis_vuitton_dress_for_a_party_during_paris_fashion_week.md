Lady Amelia Windsor turned heads as she stepped out for a cocktail dinner party in Paris on Monday night.

The royal, 24, who is 39th in line to the British throne, donned a £2,375 monochrome dress by French luxury brand Louis Vuitton, coordinated with heeled loafers as she joined fellow celebrities at the Louis Vuitton Stellar Jewelry Cocktail dinner at Place Vendome.

Lady Amelia clutched her phone and a small black handbag from the brand, drawing attention to an over-sized sparkling ring worn on her index finger.

Lady Amelia completed the look by styling her blonde hair in beach waves, with minimal make-up underneath a white face mask amid the ongoing pandemic.

Paris is set to impose strict new regulations in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases. 

Despite the crisis, the royal appeared in good spirits as she stopped to pose for photographs outside the prestigious venue.

The Place Vendom, designed by architect Peter Marino, is a place of significance for the brand because it marks the place where a young Louis Vuitton opened his first store over 160 years ago. 

The location is a hub for the brand's clothes, leather goods, fragrances, shoes and jewellery.

Monochrome proved to be a popular choice for stars in attendance at the hotly anticipated event with Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, opting for a white ruffled blouse and black mini skirt, with the addition of a handbag by Louis Vuitton.

She also put style and safety in the forefront as she teamed her number with a protective face mask while entering the event. 

Meanwhile, French fashion model Cindy Bruna demonstrated effortless style in head-to-toe black with clashing textures. 

She framed her face with bouncy curls swept to one side and dazzling drop earrings.

Blogger Camille Charria was also on trend in a black and white dress, teamed with a sparkly silver Louis Vuitton handbag .

Paris Fashion Week, which is set to host presentations by Kenzo, Kenneth Ize and Schiaparelli, will end on October 6. 

Emmanuel Macron's government has ordered bars in Paris, along with Lyon and nine other cities on 'heightened alert', to close at 10pm.

There is also a 10-person restriction at public gatherings with attendees at weddings and parties limited to 30. 

Gyms and other indoor sporting facilities will also remain closed and it remains mandatory for all pedestrians to wear face masks in public areas in the capital. 

The move comes as the president tries to avoid imposing a full lockdown across the country with the French economy already set to shrink by 8.7 per cent this year.
