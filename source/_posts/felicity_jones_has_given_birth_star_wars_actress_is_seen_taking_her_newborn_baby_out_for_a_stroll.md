Felicity Jones has given birth to her first child with husband Charles Guard, MailOnline can exclusively reveal.

The 36-year-old Star Wars actress was pictured on Friday for the first time since welcoming her bundle of joy, as she took the baby out for a walk in London.

Pushing her precious cargo along the streets of the English capital in a stylish blue pram, the screen star looked besotted as she glanced and smiled at her offspring.

The star looked stylish for her casual outing, stepping out in a navy sweater, which she teamed with a blue-and-white striped skirt.

Shielding her eyes with a pair of chic sunglasses, the Birmingham-born beauty rounded out her ensemble with a pair of white plimsolls.

Wearing her chestnut brown tresses in a lustrous bun, the actress opted to keep her makeup light and minimal for the outing, letting her natural beauty shine through.











Carrying a patterned baby bag on her shoulder, Felicity looked relaxed and happy as she navigated the pram during her relaxing mother-and-baby stroll.

It is not yet known when the actress gave birth. The baby's gender and name have also yet to be publicly revealed. 

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Felicity Jones for comment. 

Felicity first confirmed her pregnancy news after debuting her baby bump at The Aeronauts premiere in New York City in December, 17 months after tying the knot with director Charles Guard.











Felicity's representative first confirmed that she was expecting to The Hollywood Reporter, after she debuted her bump at The Aeronauts premiere.

The Theory Of Everything star dated Charles for two years before he proposed in May 2017, and they tied the knot in July 2018 at the picturesque Sudeley Castle in the Cotswolds, Oxfordshire.

Felicity and Charles are very private about their relationship and life together, but she did open up about her outlook on love in a 2014 interview with The Telegraph. 







'I am definitely romantic, and I love romantic stories — that's why I keep making romantic movies,' she said.

'It's funny how seeing a love story never gets boring, because it's the dream isn't it? It's the dream to have a true connection with another human being', she said in the interview, which occurred while she was single.

Before meeting her husband, who is best known for directing the 2009 thriller The Unknown, Felicity dated sculptor Ed Fornieles for 10 years after they met at the Ruskin School of Art.









In 2016, Felicity told Harper's Bazaar she worried how having children might impact her career.

'Fortunately, I feel like we're in a new era, where it is empowering rather than limiting to have children,' she said.

'From what I can see from friends and relatives, women get stronger and more decisive from having children, they don't waste their time doing things they don't want to.'
