Trent Alexander-Arnold has provided yet another assist for a team-mate after appearing to buy a car boot's-worth of fellow full-back Andy Robertson's new book.

The 21-year-old posted a photo on Twitter of his car piled with copies of the Scot's 'Robbo: Now You're Gonna Believe Us: Our Year, My Story' autobiography that was released this week.

The England international posted the photo with the caption 'Anything to help Robbo’s book sales...' as if to suggest Robertson would struggle to sell copies of his new release.

It is the latest in a line of jibes between the two friends — with the Liverpool pair often battling to out-do each other both off and on the pitch. 

The Premier League-winning full-backs were in a constant battle to provide more assists than the other last season, with Alexander-Arnold's 15 edging out Robertson's still impressive tally of 12. 

During lockdown, Robertson took four screenshots of the calendar reminders he has jokingly set on his phone, and a lot of them had something to do with his fellow Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Part of Robertson's 'to-do list' involved calling the Liverpool right-back twice in the morning, namely at 8:25am to say good morning and then again at 9:05am to 'check he's ok'.

The Scotland captain's new book will detail Liverpool's long-awaited Premier League title victory after 30 years last season through the eyes of Robertson.

The left-back, along with Alexander-Arnold, was an integral part of a relentless Liverpool side that finished 18 points above their nearest rivals on 99 points.
