Earlier this year, the Big Brother star shared her brutally honest thoughts about Channel Seven's revamped take on the reality show.

The Tasmanian native revealed that her fame and $250,000 prize money 'just went' in a flash, in the years after winning Big Brother.

The mother of two told the Not Here to Make Friends podcast that being a celebrity exposed her to stalkers, con men who took advantage of her, and left her unable to find work because no one would take her seriously after the show. 

Reggie ended up spending 'all the money [she] had left' on rent, before being 'ripped off' by someone claiming to be a television producer.

She has lost 90 per cent of her vision and walks with the aid of a cane.

Meanwhile, her son suffers from cystic fibrosis, an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body.
