Complaints have been flooding in from thousands of disgruntled customers unable to access their money, The Sun reported. 

Outage tracker Downdetector saw complaints beginning to come in at around midday, with more than 1,000 complaints being recorded.

Barclays said on its website that customers should be able to access their accounts on its website, or equally through telephone banking.



Customers have been complaining to the bank on Twitter this afternoon.

One person said: 'When you are on your break and need to transfer money over to get food but the Barclays app is down.'
