They recently spent some quality time together in Venice.

And Penny Lancaster looked sensational as she marked her return to the UK with a trip to Zuma in London with her husband Rod Stewart. 

The beauty, 49, put on a very leggy display as she donned a stylish floral mini dress for the dinner out on Saturday night.

Penny exuded glamour as she wore her long blonde locks down and let them cascade over her shoulders.

She added some extra height to her frame with a pair of blush pink heels and let her long sleeved dress do all the talking by keeping her accessories to a minimum. 

Meanwhile Rod also dressed up for the trip to the high-end Modern Japanese restaurant, rocking a white suit and patterned shirt.

The couple also appeared to be joined by one of their sons, who smiled for a snap alongside Rod in their white leather interior car.

Penny and Rod are parents to Alistair, 14, and Aiden, nine. The couple married in 2007 and have been spending lockdown at their homes in Florida and London.

Rock star Rod has eight children in total, with the singing sensation sharing Sean, 39, and Kimberely, 40, with his first wife Alana Stewart.

He has Ruby, 32, with model ex Kelly Emberg, as well as Renee, 26, and son Liam, 24, from his second marriage with Rachel Hunter.

Rod also has first child - Sarah Streeter, 55, from his romance with then-art student Susannah Boffey - who was given up for adoption after he fathered her at age 18.

Their dinner outing comes after Penny spoke about her experience of menopause during lockdown, revealing when she first experienced symptoms. 

The TV star admitted she has found the past few months extra tough because of her symptoms, but gushed that her husband and sons have been very understanding.

Speaking from her home, she told her Loose Women co-stars: 'Rod and I have a very close and intimate, open relationship about all sorts of things.

'I talk to him about how I'm feeling in the lead up to my period, feeling a little down or sad or… I always say, "Darling give me space today, it's the time of the month." 

'I've explained to them [my family] about the hormones I'm experiencing since March, my last period.

'I've been having the really hot sweats, and then freezing cold… my body temperature is fluctuating all over the place. It affects your mood swings, I've been putting on more weight.'

Happy couple: The pair, who wed in 2007, shared several loved-up snaps from their getaway
