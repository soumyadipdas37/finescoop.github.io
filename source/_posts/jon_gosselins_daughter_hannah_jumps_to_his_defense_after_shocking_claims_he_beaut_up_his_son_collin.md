Jon Gosselin's daughter has jumped to her father's defense in the wake of shocking claims he beat his son up, saying: 'My dad loves us... he's never been abusive.'

In an exclusive statement given to DailyMail.com Hannah Gosselin said Jon has always been a 'very loving and supportive dad' and that he's stuck by his kids no matter what.

Hannah, 16, witnessed the incident during which Jon's son Collin, also 16, told police his dad punched and kicked him.

And Hannah has confirmed to DailyMail.com that she told investigators her dad never hit Collin.

Collin Gosselin, 16, claimed in a now deleted Instagram post that his father Jon, 43, kicked and punched him during a violent altercation earlier this month

He wrote to his 21,000 Instagram followers: 'Yesterday he beat me up and thought nothing of it, he punched me in the face and gave me a swollen nose and I started bleeding. He then continued to kick me in the ribs after I was on the floor. He is a liar'

This comes as her estranged mother Kate Gosselin, who hasn't seen Collin in over five years, spoke out against her ex-husband Jon.

'Jon is a violent and abusive person,' Kate, 45, told People on Wednesday.

Kate claimed she was notified by the County of Berks, Pennsylvania Child & Youth Services that Jon was under active investigation over the incident.

'If this doesn’t qualify as assault, I don’t know what does,' the Kate Plus 8 star said of the alleged encounter.

On September 3, Collin posted on Instagram that his father was a 'liar' who 'beat' him.

'He punched me in the face and gave me a swollen nose and I started bleeding,' wrote the teenager. 'He then continued to kick me in the ribs after I was on the floor.'

The post was subsequently deleted.

DailyMail.com has since learned the incident was investigated but any claims were unfounded and the probe was dropped within 24 hours.

Berks County District Attorney John Adams also confirmed no charges or citations were issued as a result of the incident. 

Jon previously told DailyMail.com: 'I really didn't want to have to come out and talk about this for Collin's sake, but when Kate is in the media attacking me, calling me a child abuser, I have to defend myself. I love my son and I would never hurt him'

'Collin is facing many difficult issues and my dad is doing everything in his power to help him. My dad loves us and has never been abusive to us in any way,' Hannah said. She and Collin are pictured together 

Hannah told DailyMail.com: 'My dad has been there for me and Collin no matter what.

'He’s been a very loving and supportive dad throughout everything.

'Collin is facing many difficult issues and my dad is doing everything in his power to help him. My dad loves us and has never been abusive to us in any way.'

In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com Jon himself shot down Kate's claims he's still being investigated for child abuse, he said: 'It's not true, I would never hit Collin, ever. I love him with all my heart.'

Jon claims his son, who is dealing with behavioral issues, is troubled, and his report is untrue.

Upset Jon said: 'I really didn't want to have to come out and talk about this for Collin's sake, but when Kate is in the media attacking me, calling me a child abuser, I have to defend myself. I love my son and I would never hurt him.'

Jon found fame alongside Kate on the Jon & Kate Plus 8 reality show featuring their life with eight children; set of twins Mady and Cara, both 19, and sextuplets Collin, Hannah, Leah, Alex, Aaden and Joel, all 16.

Jon explained it started out as a typical day on September 2 and he had taken Collin and Hannah for a dental appointment.

But in the car on the way home the two teenagers began to fight in the back and the verbal spat escalated when the family arrived home.

'It was just like sibling rivalry stuff, but when we got home things escalated into something different,' Jon explained.

'Collin got very upset and started acting out so I intervened. He started throwing stuff at my car, denting it and shouting f**k you.

'I was angry and I confronted him and then he threatened to run away. We've had problems with Collin in the past running away and I was worried, he was upset so I restrained him.

'I didn't punch or kick him, I restrained him, which he obviously wasn't happy about. He's 16, he's a 16-year-old boy.

'I restrained him and then I backed away, because you never want to restrain your kids, it's the most heart-wrenching thing you ever have to do.'

Jon and Kate divorced in 2009 after 10 years of marriage, and found huge fame thanks to their reality series Jon & Kate Plus 8 

Jon said soon after he drove away from the house to give Collin some space to calm down. But his daughter called minutes later.

'Hannah called me and said Collin's going to call the police. So I turned around, I came back and he called the police,' Jon recalled.

'He told them I punched him in the face and kicked him in the ribs. And I was like, I didn't do any of that stuff.'

Jon says an officer arrived soon after and interviewed him and Collin and also Hannah who witnessed the incident.

'Hannah saw the whole thing and she gave her statement and I gave my statement,' Jon said.

'Hannah told them I didn't hit Collin and the police could see there were no marks or bruises on him.'

Jon said the police officer accepted Jon and Hannah's version of events, but as a mandated reporter he was required to report the incident to CYS.

'I get it, the police have to do their job,' Jon conceded. 'The CYS came out and interviewed us and they also spoke to Collin's mother Kate and his other siblings and that was the end of it, the claims were unfounded.'

The former reality star says he was told by his lawyer the following day that any CYS investigation had been dropped and no further action would be taken by the police.

The morning after the incident, as a punishment for Collin's shocking behavior, Jon decided to take the boy's Xbox and some other stuff out of his room.

'You can't just go about doing things without consequences,' Jon said.

'But then he threatened to do an IG post if I don't give his stuff back. So now he's using leverage.

'I said, "I don't care, I'm still gonna discipline you". I told him I loved him, but it's just the way it's got to be.'

On Thursday Jon's ex-wife Kate waded in telling People magazine she had been notified by the County of Berks, Pennsylvania Child & Youth Services that Jon was under investigation over the incident.

He said that while Collin was 'caged' for three years at a behavioral institution, his mother only visited him three times for less than two hours total, all while refusing to tell Jon where Collin was being kept.

Jon has been dealing with the fallout ever since.

'Dealing with a child with mental health issues is taxing, I'm taxed,' the IT consultant admitted. 'But I love my son. I will not give up. I go to therapy, we all go to family therapy, to deal with having a son that has been traumatized and abused by his mother.

'It's very difficult for me. I'm trying to learn how to handle Collin, I have my own demons as well, but I never punched him or kicked him or anything like that.

Jon added: 'None of this is Collin's fault. He's 16. He's got a lot of issues to work through and we're here to help him.'
