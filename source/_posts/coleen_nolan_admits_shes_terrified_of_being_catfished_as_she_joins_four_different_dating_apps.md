Coleen Nolan has admitted that she is terrified of being catfished after joining four different dating apps in her search for love. 

The Loose Women star, 55, had already signed up to one site but got serious with her pursuit of romance by joining three more following advice from her co-presenters.

In a chat with Ruth Langsford, Saira Khan, and Janet Street Porter on Tuesday's show, Coleen also revealed that one of the pictures on her profile is a makeup-free shot because she wants to present the real her.

She explained: 'It's really difficult, I put this picture on because I have put other pictures on where I've got full makeup on.

'But I thought, actually, they'd better know me from the start.

She went on to discuss her fears over the catfishing, saying: 'But here's my issue - how do I know it's the real them?'

Advice: In a chat with Ruth Langsford, Saira Khan, and Janet Street Porter on Tuesday's show, Coleen also revealed that one of the pictures on her profile is a makeup-free shot 

Ruth replied: 'This is the issue isn't it, I think that's why so many people are put off.'

Although Coleen seemed nervous about getting back out on the dating scene, Janet - who has been divorced twice - offered some words of advice, saying: 'I don't know why you are embarrassed.

'Most of my friends met their partners online, that's the modern way to do it.

Chat: She went on to discuss her fears over the catfishing, saying: 'But here's my issue - how do I know it's the real them?' to which Ruth (pictured) replied: 'This is the issue isn't it'

'And since lockdown, people are even more nervous about meeting people, and it is the only way forward, you've just got to get your head around it Coleen.' 

She added: 'The option is be lonely and only see the dogs and the kids when they come round, or go out have a bit of fun and meet someone.

'You're not looking for a bloke you're to marry, you're just looking for someone to have fun with.'

Coleen revealed she 'melted into a pool of embarrassment' when a man she had been talking to on the app gave her his number and asked her to give him a ring. 

New romance?: Coleen Nolan revealed last month that she has been messaging a younger man on social media and confessed that it is 'nice to have a flirt'

'That's a bit too much. When it comes to going on a date and I fancy someone I turn into a 12-year-old schoolgirl, I forget my own name. I'm rubbish, I am the biggest cowardly flirt you'll ever meet.'  

She added that it was a worry if people know her from her singing fame or from Loose Women.

'I had a message yesterday that said, 'I bet you're in the mood for dancing, and I thought, 'Oh for god's sake,' and deleted him,' she said.

It comes after last month Coleen revealed on the show that she has been messaging a younger man on social media and confessed that it is 'nice to have a flirt'.

Split: Coleen has been single for three years after splitting from her second husband Ray Fensome in 2017 after 11 years of marriage (pictured in 2013)

The presenter said she was speaking to a 38-year-old suitor during a candid chat about age differences in relationships 

However she also questioned why someone much younger would be interested in an older woman as she mused whether it was because of her fame or money. 

'I would always question why would a 35 year old want to be with a 55 year old? Is it because I'm on telly or you think I'm rich? Having said that, on social media, I have been speaking to a 38-year-old. He's like a 38-year-old with an older soul.'

Her fellow panellist Michelle Ackerley then chipped in saying 'you need to connect' to which Coleen responded: 'Yeah, the problem is you don't really get that on dating websites'.
