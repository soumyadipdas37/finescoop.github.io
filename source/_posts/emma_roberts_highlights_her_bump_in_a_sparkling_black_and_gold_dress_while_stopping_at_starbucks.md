Emma Roberts was spotted showing off her growing baby bump during a stop at a Starbuck in Los Angeles' Los Feliz neighborhood on Saturday.

The 29-year-old American Horror Story star was seen making a quick stop for a snack and drink before taking care of other errands.

The actress was put on a bright display in her floral mini dress which was covered in a gold ditsy print.

The low-cut dress featured puffy shoulders and long sleeves culminating in frilled cuffs.

She highlighted her slender legs in the outfit and paired it with an edgy pair of black platform boots that elevated her 5ft2in stature.

Emma wore her shoulder-length blonde tresses parted down the middle, and she carried along a black handbag.

She did her part to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus by wearing a navy mask reading, 'Oh hey,' in crimson embroidery.

Missing from Emma's outing was her partner Garrett Hedlund, 36, with whom she announced her pregnancy on Instagram on August 30.

She announced they were expecting a baby boy by captioning the post, 'Me...and my two favorite guys.'

Emma waited to confirm the news of her pregnancy, but it actually broke on June 25, when her mother Kelly Cunningham confirmed it on Instagram.

After a fan asked if the Scream Queens star was expecting, she replied, 'Yes,' and added a heart emoji. 

'Thank you so much! Very excited,' she replied to another fan congratulating her.

A source told Us Weekly at the time that it was an amicable breakup and that they were now 'just friends.'
