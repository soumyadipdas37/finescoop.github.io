Jon Hamm and his girlfriend Anna Osceola looked happy in love as they strolled  arm-in-arm after purchasing a handful of snacks in Santa Monica, California on Tuesday. 

While displaying some light PDA, the 49-year-old actor and his former Mad Men co-star, 32, were practically joined at the hip on their walk back to their car. 

The duo both kept their noses and mouth concealed under their respective face covers as they toted around two bottles of water and a few bags of pretzels and chips.

The TV star opted to wear a classic pair of aviator sunglasses, a baseball cap and jeans, which he cuffed at the bottom.  

He completed his casual look with a white button-down and a lightweight beige jacket.

Meanwhile, Osceola, who is 17 years his junior, flashed plenty of her sun-kissed skin in a pair of tiny black shorts.

The Greek actress, who was previously romantically linked to Ben Affleck, certainly looked leggy in her black short shorts, which she belted to emphasize her trim figure. 

She and Hamm were first spotted together in 2017, two years after they appeared in the May 2015 series finale of Mad Men. 

In the episode, Osceola played the receptionist at the spiritual retreat his character was staying in.

Virtual hang: The movie icon recently teased a virtual hang to support small theater in his hometown of St. Louis. Independent theaters are struggling immensely due to the pandemic prompting Jon to give back to his roots 

The pair have drummed up dating rumors for years, after the end of his 18-year relationship with Jennifer Westfeldt in 2015.  

Though he has been enjoying time with Osceola amid the pandemic, the actor has also been gearing up for a couple projects.

Speaking to Hoda Kotb on an episode of Today two weeks ago, Hamm discussed the virtual hangout he is promoting to support small theater in his hometown of St. Louis.

Top Gun: Hamm stars alongside Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Val Kilmer and Jennifer Connelly for the second installment of the 1986 classic Top Gun. The film is set to be released in December 2020

The actor who 'earned his equity card' working in small theaters wants to give back to the struggling arts businesses that gave him the experience to make it as a working actor by raffling a 'virtual chat' with him for donations. 

In addition to giving back to his community, the actor also is preparing for the release of Top Gun Maverick, a sequel to the 1986 classic film starring Tom Cruise.  

Hamm will be playing alongside Miles Teller as well as Top Gun original actors Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and Jennifer Connelly. The film is set to be released on December 23, 2020 and according to Hamm will be 'everything you hope it's going to be.'
