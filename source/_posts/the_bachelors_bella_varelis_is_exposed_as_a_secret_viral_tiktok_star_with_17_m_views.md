Bella Varelis has previously been forced to deny claims that she joined The Bachelor in search of fame rather than love.  

But the brunette beauty's past as a social media influencer and viral TikTok star tell a very different story. 

The 25-year-old is actually an aspiring TikTok superstar with an impressive viewership in the millions. 

Proof she's only on The Bachelor for fame? Locky Gilbert's frontrunner Bella Varelis, 25, (pictured) has been exposed as a secret viral TikTok star 

On January 27, the brunette became a viral sensation on TikTok when she uploaded a video of herself flaunting her small waist in a pair of denim shorts. 

In the clip, which has been viewed 1.7M times, Bella zooms in the camera to her crotch as she demonstrates a clever technique for tightening her shorts' waistline.  

'I didn’t know @addisonre did this before 250,000 of you told me she did... i know belts exist - don’t get @ me,' she boasted in her caption, adding hashtags including '#lifehack'.

Wonder why it was so popular? In the clip, which has been viewed 1.7M times, Bella zooms in the camera to her crotch as she demonstrates a clever technique for tightening her shorts' waistline.

Another TikTok video uploaded on January 14 showed Bella sitting on the bed while moving her dog's legs in time with the song Woah by KRYPTO9095. 

The comedic post has garnered a whopping 35.7K views. 

It comes after the brunette beauty's past as a social media influencer and model was revealed after her many sponsored posts resurfaced online.

Judging by the pictures on the website, Bella appears to be promoting fashion and beauty-themed showbags.  

This is far from the first sponsored content that Bella has been involved with.

In one post shared to Facebook, Bella holds up a bottle of ReefSun tanning oil while offering her followers a chance to win a tropical holiday. 

Another post features two 'candid' photos of Bella holding a bottle of BondiBoost hair treatment. 

'I couldn't choose between these two photos so here are both, don't get @ me,' she wrote alongside the hashtags #BondiBoost #BoostYourRoots and #Ad.

Bella has previously described herself as a girl with 'an ardour for writing, style, beauty, travel, food and wellness'.

'I have worked on jobs from magazine editorials, fashion e-commerce websites to Instagram content,' she states in her biography on TheRight.fit website.

TheRight.fit is a platform that allows marketing companies to scout and browse talent for endorsements. 

Days earlier, a 2017 television advertisement for retail chain TK Maxx starring Bella surfaced online.

The commercial shows her dancing around a wooden clothing stand in a variety of different outfits.

Earlier this month, Bella publicly slammed allegations she was an aspiring actress who once dreamt of moving to LA to further her career.

'I've never moved to LA, I've never wanted or tried to be an actress in Australia, never wanted or tried to get work as an actress in LA and certainly am not acting on the Bachelor,' she wrote on Instagram.

Without naming names, she claimed that people had tried to 'fabricate' stories about her in order to feel 'relevant' and 'important'.

During an anonymous Q&A session on The Bachelor earlier this season, the other contestants surprised Bella with a question about her influencer career.

They asked her if she was on the show to get more followers, and she replied that she already had enough followers and was only interested in Locky Gilbert.

Locky was also asked if Bella was his 'favourite'. He responded by saying that he didn't have favourites and was still getting to know everyone.
