She's the longest-serving coach on The Voice Australia, after joining the stellar line-up for its debut season in 2012.

And as news broke on the weekend that Channel Seven had picked up the rights to the program in 2021 from rival Nine - the only thing people wanted to know was what would happen to Delta Goodrem, 35.

After Sonia Kruger announced on Instagram that she would be taking over as host from Darren McMullen and Renee Bargh, the 55-year-old was inundated with questions about the Born To Try singers future.

 'Will Delta still be a judge?' asked one concerned fan.

 'I hope Delta Goodrem's still got a gig.. She is a great judge and mentor,' shared another.

One fan even threatened to boycott the show entirely if the blonde beauty failed to be kept on. 





Concern: Delta's fans voiced their concern for her future with the singing program on a post Sonia Kruger made on Instagram 

'Sonia's back yayayayayayy but if Delta goes I’m not watching anymore,' she said.

Sonia shared the news she was returning by sharing a stunning image of herself, flashing her trim pins in a polka dot mini dress on-set of the hit program.

'The Voice is coming to Channel 7! Cannot wait to hit Australia’s biggest stage again for the sizzling new season of the Voice,' she wrote. 

Confirmed:Over the weekend, Big Brother's Sonia Kruger (pictured) announced she will be taking over from hosts Darren McMullen and Renee Bargh and returning to the program when it moves to Channel Seven next year

Nine 'failed to renew the contract' for the 2021 season, with Seven jumping on the deal 'very quickly', it was confirmed on Saturday.  

In a statement, Seven's CEO and managing director James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.

James already has changes in mind for the show, with less episodes and a tighter production schedule.

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter timeframe,' he said.

It is believed the contracts for coaches Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland and Boy George, are yet to be signed.

No mention was made regarding the future of Guy Sebastian.

'I have been thankful to have been a part of the show since its inception which means I'm also a part of its evolution,' the 35-year-old said.

'I take great pride in the incredible show we make and the phenomenon it continues to be.

'The amount of magical moments that I have been a part of and that have happened over the years will always stay with me.'
