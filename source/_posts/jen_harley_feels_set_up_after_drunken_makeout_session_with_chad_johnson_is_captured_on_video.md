Jen Harley has no memory of a drunken make-out session with Bachelorette alum Chad Johnson, which was captured on video.

In the clips Ronnie Ortiz-Magro's ex can be seen kissing the wannabe porn mogul in Las Vegas restaurant JING, before giving him a lap dance.

But her representative has since denounced the video, arguing that Jen was 'extremely intoxicated' and does not remember what took place, implying that Chad took advantage of her inebriated state.

The 32-year-old's rep stated to TMZ: 'Jen Harley is not dating Chad or anyone for that matter. Jen is only friends with Chad and had met up with him to show him a house earlier that day for sale.'

They added: 'Jen had not had anything to eat all day, she was drinking alcohol at the club and was extremely intoxicated.'

'Jen does not remember anything in the video and is disgusted and embarrassed by her actions. Jen feels she was set up by Chad and his friends who were clearly taking videos to sell to the press.'

The video, which was taken Thursday night, shows the pair pretty tuned out, as they kiss and pack on the PDA at a table in the dimly lit restaurant, which features a nightclub lighting aesthetic with music to match.

At one point in the make-out session, Jen was sitting in the 33-year-old's lap, as a man behind the camera jokingly shouted: 'That's f***ing disgusting. Get that s*** out of here!'

Jen then looked up and noticed the camera, uncomfortably laughing and telling him: 'F*** you guys.' 

Chad then proceeded to fondle the mother-of-one in front of their unmasked group, before she gave him a lap dance, while carrying a glass of champagne.

She later kissed him while sitting in another woman's lap (apparently mid lap dance), as another woman came up from behind her and grinded back-to-back.

The duo was later spotted moving their display outside, as they continued making out in the streets.

Chad told DailyMail.com back in April that he planned to move to Vegas and start a 'porn palace,' after reportedly making upwards of $40k a month, posting videos of on/off girlfriend Annalise Mishler, 25, on OnlyFans.

He said at the time: 'To be able to make money off of it is f***ing amazing. I don’t regret it at all. I always knew I’d do something in this industry, I just wasn’t sure what.'

Annalise previously accused him of domestic violence in late February, for which he was charged with six misdemeanors. 

Chad struck a deal last month, pleading no contest to one count of vandalism and one count of intimidating a witness, in exchange for dropping the other four charges for corporal injury, battery, trespassing and vandalism.

He was ultimately given 36 months probation and ordered to take domestic violence classes, with a restitution hearing coming up in a few months.

Jen also accused Ronnie, 34, with whom she shares daughter Ariana Sky, two, of domestic violence last October.
