People are buying their own fire trucks on Craigslist and other websites after furious wildfires devastated California this summer and scorched through more than 1.5million acres of land.

This year’s California wildfires sparked by dry lightning strikes have exhausted the state's fire services including firefighters, crucial trucks and other resources.  

Now the demand for fire trucks on online markets like Craigslist is unprecedented.

Sacramento company Vans From Japan, which buys trucks from Japan and sells them in California, is also cashing in on the demand for fire services by selling old fire trucks. 

People are buying their own fire trucks on Craigslist following devastating lightning-sparked wildfires in California. This seller is advertising a 53-year-old Ford fire truck saying: 'With these lightning complex fires going on, mabe you could use it'

This fire truck with a 1985 Pierce Dash Fire engine from Skywalker Ranch is on the market for $5,000 

One Craigslist listing advertises a 2013 Peterbilt water truck that can carry 2,500 gallons of water and 'meets all Cal Fire specs' for $69,000 in Pacifica, California.

Another listing advertises a 53-year-old Ford 150 fire truck for $15,000. In the listing the seller says they were 'told the pump needed some seals', but they added 'with these lightning complex fires going on, maybe you could still use it.'

In Napa a seller is offering a 'Type 6 Fire Truck' for $17,500 that features a Hale pump and 200 feet of hard line hose with a nozzle, SFGate reported.

'I purchased two of these trucks that were maintained as reserve units for Cal Fire… but only really need one,' the seller wrote.

One Craigslister posted a 1975 GMC fire truck for $7,000 or best offer with the description, 'Save yourself from a disaster,' according to NPR.

Another listing advertises a fire truck with a 1985 Pierce Dash Fire engine from Skywalker Ranch for just $5,000.

Sacramento company Vans From Japan, which buys trucks from Japan and sells them in California, is now cashing in on the demand for fire services by selling fire trucks

One of Vans From Japan's items was a 1992 Toyota Hiace Fire Truck sold to a buyer in Hillsoboro, Oregon

Climate change’s increasing temperatures and decreased rains have only fuelled wildfire season and led to a rise in insurance premiums, the growth of the private firefighting industry, and now personal fire trucks. 

Cal Fire has discouraged locals from hiring their own firefighting teams to protect their own land, especially during evacuation orders.  

'People don’t understand the ferocity of these fires that we’ve been dealing with the last five or so years. They’re very unpredictable and you can’t project what the fire’s going to do,' Cal Fire Captain Scott McLean said.

Wildfires have caused insurance premiums to rise, the wealthy to hire private firefighters, and now fire trucks to protect their land. Firefighters pictured monitoring a backfire in the Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve in Guerneville, California on August 25

Last month's lightning strikes sparked some of the largest wildfires in California history including the SCU lightning Complex, the second largest blaze in the state’s history, and the LNU Lightning complex, the third largest.

The fires have led to eight fatalities and the destruction of more than 3,100 structures.
