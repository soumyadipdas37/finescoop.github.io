He confirmed his split with Bachelorette star Angie Kent in July, after 10 months of dating.

But on Tuesday, Carlin Sterritt told the How to Life podcast he was initially hesitant about announcing the news as he feared fans would mock him because runner-up Timm Hanly was the favourite.

'I was worried about trolls but also the ongoing opinion that I wasn't right for Angie. I didn't want to give anyone the satisfaction,' he said.

'People said "Angie should of chosen Timm and I knew this would only last this long". Having to deal with this was very hard,' he added.

Carlin went on to say: 'There was a lot of fear and anxiety to let the news out because I wasn't sure what the outcome was going to be.'

The personal trainer also revealed his relationship with Angie began to fall apart after he discovered she was texting runner-up Timm.

'She really cared for Tim. They were kind of messaging a little bit afterwards. I was trying to play it cool, like "it's fine, it's all good,"' Carlin began. 

'I was trying to be nice and I was trying to do the right thing,' he said.

'And then more and more, her and Timm messaging each other, it just started to really eat me away.'

Angie and Carlin announced their break-up on July 1, after weeks of speculation they had quietly called it quits.

In an interview last month, the personal trainer was forced to deny claims he faked his romance with Angie for entertainment purposes.

He told the Secret Weapon podcast: 'You can't go that long faking who you are as a person. Some people might be able to. But I don't have that capacity.'
