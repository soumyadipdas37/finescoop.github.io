COVID-19 conspiracy theorist and anti-vaxxer Pete Evans has encouraged his fans not to wear a mask or practice social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The celebrity chef, 47, shared a bizarre Instagram post on Wednesday claiming that coronavirus could be 'solved in a very short period of time' if people start living a 'healthier' life. 

Reposting an article about the potential links between obesity and serious COVID-19 cases, Pete wrote: '7 months later and the 'experts' are just linking this.

'The virus is not the issue. Peoples health is and always has been the issue,' the former My Kitchen Rules judge wrote. 

Pete, who has no medical qualifications, suggested that a 'strong and healthy population' could be achieved through 'diet, lifestyle, connection to nature, love, sunlight, joy, play, reduced pharmaceuticals, anti inflammatory environment and clean water.  

Despite scientific data proving the contrary, Pete also claimed people should embrace 'human connection (no social distancing)', 'fresh air (no masks)', and 'movement (no contract tracing)'. 

'The virus is not the issue': Pete, who has no medical qualifications, suggested that a 'strong and healthy population' could be achieved through 'diet, lifestyle and connection to nature' - rather than wearing masks, social distancing and contact tracing 

He also said that society should remove 'limiting belief systems' and do away with the so-called 'fear based media', politicians, and health ministers who have 'conflicts of interest'.  

'Pretty simple formula. This could all be solved In a very short period of time. The invitation is and has always been there,' he concluded. 

Last week, Pete told his online followers that Facebook and Instagram are now removing posts and pages that share his dangerous beliefs.

Pete, who has previously blamed coronavirus on 5G cell towers, shared an Instagram post encouraging fans to follow him on Telegram, a messaging app, in case his other social media pages are banned.  

In June, Evans was invited on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network.

The program faced criticism for choosing to interview Evans, thereby giving airtime to his dangerous anti-vaccination and coronavirus conspiracy theories.
