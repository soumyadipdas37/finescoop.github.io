Channel Ten's The Masked Singer has been hit by claims the performances are prerecorded.

On Friday, an alleged industry insider told The Sunday Telegraph the celebrities on the show don't perform live and they only wear their costumes during the unveiling.

'All the vocals are prerecorded prior to filming and the performances are done by dancers or doubles,' the source said.

'They don't perform at all. It's written in to their contracts,' the insider claimed.

However, a Channel Ten spokesperson denied the claims and told the publication the celebrities perform on stage.  

'These claims are rubbish. Don't know who this crew member is but they clearly have no idea,' the spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, judge Jackie 'O' Henderson and host Osher Günsberg were granted hotel quarantine exemptions from NSW authorities to film the finale in Sydney on Tuesday.

Both stars were allowed back into the state after undergoing a mandatory 14 days of self isolation in Melbourne, following an outbreak of COVID-19 on the show's set.

With several key cast members in different states, the crew had to get very creative when it came to producing the grand finale.

Both Osher and Jackie O filmed from a Sydney studio, while fellow panellists Dannii Minogue and Dave Hughes returned to the Docklands set.

Last month, production on the show halted just hours before the finale was set to be taped. The rest of the season had already been recorded. 

Seven dancers tested positive for COVID-19 on August 22, and the show's stars were ordered to self-isolate immediately.
