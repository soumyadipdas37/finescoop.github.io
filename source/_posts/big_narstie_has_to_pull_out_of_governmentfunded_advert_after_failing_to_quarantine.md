Big Narstie has had to pull out of a high-profile government scheme to attract visitors to Britain because he failed to quarantine after flying back from Spain.

The rapper, 34, was filming a promo video in the Yorkshire Dales for Visit Britain, when he realised he should have been isolation at home after his party holiday.

Big Narstie had been joined by a film crew in picturesque Malham, which featured as a location in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, for a government-funded advert.

But after Big Narstie - real name Tyrone Lino - had been filmed praising the local attractions, such as a waterfall known as Janet's Foss, and dining in a local gastropub, producers realised that the rapper should have been in quarantine and promptly ended filming.

Visit Britain has had to bin the footage, while the agency behind the promo video Gravity Road are looking for another artist for a reshoot.

MailOnline has contacted Big Narstie's representatives for comment.

Having a blast: Just days before arriving in the Yorkshire Dales he posted a couple of videos on his TikTok profile partying in Spain

The grime artist and funnyman hosts the Channel 4 chat show The Big Narstie Show and as well as his musical achievements has appeared on Celebrity Juice and Would I Lie to You?

Just days before arriving in the Yorkshire Dales he posted a couple of videos on his TikTok profile partying in Spain.

Big Nastie commented on Instagram: 'Yo people Just to let everyone know that no matter what anyone tells you you HAVE to quarantine when you come back into the UK. 

'I made a mistake thinking that the corona test I took abroad and then took another one when I came back made me exempt from quarantining but I was WRONG and now I'm in quarantine for 2 weeks so the moral of the story is Quarantine is REEEAAALL even if you've had a corona test.'

A VisitBritain spokesperson said: 'We were made aware that an individual contracted by a creative agency for a VisitBritain campaign had not followed official UK Government guidance on self-isolating after returning from a country currently on the quarantine list.

'Our understanding is that this individual is now quarantining and no further filming is taking place with them on this campaign. 

'As we are unable to use this footage in our campaign, the creative agency who is contracted to provide this film are now working to secure replacement footage.'
