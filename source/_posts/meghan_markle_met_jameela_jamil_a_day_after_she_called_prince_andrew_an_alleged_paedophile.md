Meghan Markle met Jameela Jamil at the couple's sprawling California mansion just one day after the former Radio 1 DJ dubbed Prince Andrew a pedophile on Twitter, a source claimed.

The Good Place star, 34, said the Duke of York - Prince Harry's uncle - was the Firm's 'alleged resident pedo' and claimed he was 'besties with a sex trafficker' in a Twitter rant on August 22.

Just one day later, Jamil - who is known for her 'woke' opinions - is believed to have traveled to the Sussex's sprawling nine-bedroom and 16-bathroom mansion in Montecito with her boyfriend singer-songwriter James Blake.

Jamil was one of Meghan's 15 Forces For Change in her September 2019 guest-edited Vogue issue and it was then that the pair became friends

A source told The Sun: 'Jameela and James drove up to Montecito from Los Angeles and spent time with Meghan and Harry.

'They also had a stroll on the beach but Meghan and Harry didn’t venture out with them.' 

Jamil and Blake were pictured taking a stroll on a beach in Montecito - just a short distance away from Meghan and Harry's new home - on August 22, one day prior to their supposed visit and the same day as the tweet.

Jamil stood up for Meghan amid claims the Suits actress went against royal family rules by being political.

The former T4 star wrote: 'I *THINK* they may be more embarrassed by their alleged resident pedo Andrew who was besties with a sex trafficker, than an American supporting women voting in her own country, and loosely referencing the importance of general democracy which is being threatened here currently.'

A Twitter user replied to Jamil's post by saying: 'Plus didn't they step back from the monarchy? Why does everyone wanna hate her so much, its so sad and disgusting.'

Jamil responded: 'Because she’s not white. And because she’s smart, strong, opinionated, rebellious, beautiful, happy and has everything they never will. 

'She’s a terrifying threat to patriarchy because she doesn’t fit the stereotype for women. They discredit her because they can’t kill her.'

Virginia Roberts - now known as Virginia Giuffre - says she was trafficked by pedophile financier Epstein and alleges the duke had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was 17.

Andrew has categorically denied he has had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Giuffre.
