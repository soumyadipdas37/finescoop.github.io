Manchester City will offer Lionel Messi a two-year contract if they are able to sign him from Barcelona.

As reported by Cadena Ser, City are eager for Messi to help them fulfil their longstanding ambition of winning the Champions League.

The same publication report that City's director of football Txiki Begiristain is already in Barcelona in an attempt to strike a deal for Messi.

Reuniting with his former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola would certainly be appealing to Messi, but there is still much work for City to do in order to sign him.

If they were able to sign Messi, City would be open to extending his contract beyond the initial two years.  

Messi remains in a dispute with Barcelona and failed to turn up for the first two days of pre-season as he looks to secure a move away from the club.

The 33-year-old felt that he was free to leave due to a clause in his contract, but LaLiga stated that Messi is still a Barcelona player, with his contract running until June 30, 2021, and any club wishing to sign him must pay his release clause of £630m (£700m).  

Messi is facing the prospect of a £1.1m fine and a suspension after missing the start of Barcelona's pre-season preparations.  

His father Jorge is set to meet with the Barcelona board this week in an attempt to resolve the situation.
