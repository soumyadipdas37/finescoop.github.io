She sent the romance rumour mill went into overdrive last weekend when she was spotted enjoying a night out with The Crown's Matt Smith in London. 

But Emilia Clarke proved there was only room for one man, or dog, in her life as she shared snaps of her cosying up to her beloved pooch Ted.

Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, The Game of Thrones star, 33, shared an adorable snap of her dog in her handbag, while another saw her snuggle the pooch in bed.

In the first picture, Emilia cut a chic figure in a tweed blazer, skinny jeans and leather mules with fluffy soles.

The star took precautions as she covered up in a blue and white striped face mask while carrying her adorable dachshund puppy in a slouchy brown bag.

The second image showed Emilia laying in bed with her arm around Ted, while she wore a colourful sleeping mask atop her head.

Captioning the sweet pictures, she wrote: 'The only thing this pup can’t do is make me breakfast in bed.'

Emilia's post came after she sparked romance speculation, after she was seen stepping out with handsome actor Matt Smith, 37. 

The pair – who appeared together in the 2015 movie Terminator: Genisys – were all smiles as they sauntered through Soho together last Friday night.

Emilia and Matt looked to be enjoying one another's company as they strolled after having dinner at the Russian-inspired Bob Bob Ricard restaurant. 

He split from actress Lily James nine months ago, having previously dated model Daisy Lowe, the daughter of rock star Gavin Rossdale.

Screen star Matt was also romantically linked to Karen Gillan, his co-star when he was Doctor Who between 2010 and 2013. 

He met Lily a year later on the set of the film Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, but they split amid rumours of his close friendship with Claire Foy, who starred opposite him as the Queen in The Crown.

By comparison, Emilia – who was named Esquire magazine’s Sexiest Woman Alive in 2015 – has had an uncomplicated love life. 

She recently split from director and writer Charlie McDowell, the son of actor Malcolm McDowell and US actress Mary Steenburgen. 

She previously dated Seth MacFarlane, the creator of the US animated comedy Family Guy.
