Ashley James is expecting her first child in just four months.

But on Thursday the pregnant reality star spoke candidly on the hormones she's been experiencing during her second trimester.

The star shared a teary-eyed selfie of herself, telling fans she had cried at everything recently from 'TV adverts to my nipples hurting.'  

Emotional: Ashley James is expecting her first child in four months but on Thursday the star spoke candidly on the hormones she's been experiencing during pregnancy

Sharing a selfie of herself in her pjs with no makeup on, Ashley wrote in the lengthy caption: 'No YOU'RE crying at adverts on TV in your pyjamas on a Thursday morning.'

'I'm fine by the way, I'm just aware that seeing everyone's highlights on social media can feel very isolating if you're sat having a cry in your PJs. And wow, this pregnancy has my emotions all over the place. Anyone else?'

She continued: 'Crying is normal, feeling sad or overwhelmed is normal, especially with hormones raging round our bodies. It's what makes us human, and not robots.'

Ashley then listed 'some of the things I've got emotional about this week,' which included 'Emotional tv adverts. The news. My parents sending flowers to mark 4 months until they meet their grandson. My nipples hurting. A global pandemic pausing my DJ career. Because I'm having a baby in 4 months (holy sh*t) Just because.'

'Our emotions and vulnerabilities are what help us be a caring, sensitive, compassionate, and relatable human being.'

'I used to think being 'happy' meant not feeling sad or emotional, but that's not true (watch Inside Out, it was life-changing for me!).'

'Ive come to realise that it's our ability to be able to FEEL our emotions, understand and learn from them, and then be able to let them go (rather than suppress them or grow resentful) that make us happy.' 

Letting it out: Ashley ended her post by telling her followers she was going to 'let it all out' at her first pregnancy yoga class, later sharing a snap of her sporty ensemble on Stories
