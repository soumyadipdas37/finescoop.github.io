Adding to her outfit with a leopard print bag, Madison also sported white trainers and a pair of sunglasses.

Madison has sparked dating rumours in recent weeks as she has been seen out with TikTok star Nick Austin as of late.

Helping hand: Madison initially rose to fame in 2012 when Justin Bieber shared a song she covered on YouTube when she was just 13 

She and Nick, 20, were first linked in August after they were spotted having dinner together and showing off some PDA.

Madison initially rose to fame in 2012 when Justin Bieber shared a song she covered on YouTube when she was just 13.

The massive attention helped her land a recording contract with Island Records and led to the release of her debut EP As She Pleases in early 2018.

More recently, she's set to release her debut full-length album Life Support this year, though a release date hasn't been announced yet.

She has dropped four singles ahead of the album's release since January, including the songs Good In Goodbye, Selfish, Stained Glass and Baby.
