Budget airline Tigerair has officially shut down after 13 years in the air as coronavirus continues to wreak havoc on the travel industry. 

The low-cost carrier, which was run by Virgin Australia, made the announcement on Thursday night.

'There is no denying these are tough times for everyone in the travel and tourism industry,' a spokesman said.

'And sadly, after nearly 13 years of operation we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the Tigerair Australia brand.'

Customers with Tigerair flight credit will be able to put it towards Virgin Australia flights.
