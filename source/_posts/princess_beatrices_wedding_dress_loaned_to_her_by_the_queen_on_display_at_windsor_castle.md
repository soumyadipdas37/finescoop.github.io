The dress worn by Princess Beatrice at her scaled down wedding two months ago is going on display at Windsor Castle from Thursday.

The Sir Norman Hartnell gown, first worn by the Queen in the 1960s, was loaned to Beatrice by her grandmother for her secret, low-key wedding to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in July.

The stunning dress will be on display from September 24 until November 22, the Royal Collection Trust announced earlier this month. 

Photos show the dress inside its new home in a display cabinet inside the castle.

Beatrice, 32, and Edoardo, 37, had planned to marry in May but the coronavirus lockdown, which restricted the number of guests, forced them to reschedule.

Instead, they had a low-key ceremony which was only attended by close family including the Queen. 

Also to go on display at Windsor will be Beatrice's wedding shoes, made by Valentino, and a replica of her bridal bouquet. 

She previously wore the shoes on other occasions including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011.

The Queen first wore the taffeta gown for a state dinner at the British Embassy in Rome during a visit in 1961

Beatrice's bouquet was designed by Patrice Van Helden and contained trailing jasmine, pale pink and cream sweet peas, Royal Porcelina spray roses, pink O'Hara roses, pink 'wax flower' and baby pink astilbe, as well as sprigs of myrtle in keeping with the tradition for royal brides. 

Made of peau de soie taffeta, the royal wedding dress features geometric hand embroidery in crystals and diamantes over the bodice, waist and hips, and the skirt is trimmed with a band of ivory duchesse satin.

It was altered for Beatrice by the Queen's personal adviser and dresser Angela Kelly and the fashion designer Stewart Parvin.

The Queen first wore the taffeta gown for a state dinner at the British Embassy in Rome during a visit in 1961.

She also wore it to the world premiere of Lawrence Of Arabia at the Odeon Leicester Square in December 1962 and the State Opening of Parliament in 1966.

Detailing how the vintage piece was carefully remodelled for Beatrice's big day, the Royal Collection said each alteration made to the dress is reversible to preserve the historic garment.

Changes included the full skirt being softened for a more modern look and the addition of short organza sleeves.

A spokeswoman for Trust said: 'The full-skirted silhouette was softened to give a more contemporary, simplified shape, and the underskirt and petticoats were recreated and bound with silk tulle.

'Short sleeves of triple organza were added to the straps and embroidered with vintage diamantes to match the original Hartnell embroidery design.

'Each alteration made to the dress is reversible.'

The princess also wore a tiara loaned to her by the Queen – the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara which the Queen, as Princess Elizabeth, wore on her own wedding day in 1947. But the tiara will not be part of the exhibition.

The Trust spokeswoman said: 'It has not been possible on this occasion to display the tiara worn by Her Royal Highness on her wedding day.'

Beatrice and property tycoon Mr Mapelli Mozzi were originally due to marry in the Chapel Royal followed by a reception in the gardens of Buckingham Palace – but their wedding was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.

They eventually wed in a private ceremony, which was not made public beforehand, at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor on July 17.

Beatrice's father the Duke of York walked her down the aisle but he did not feature in the photographs released by Buckingham Palace.

The special display of Princess Beatrice's wedding dress is part of a visit to Windsor Castle from September 24 to November 22 2020. Tickets must be pre-booked in advance at www.rct.uk or +44 (0)303 123 7304.
