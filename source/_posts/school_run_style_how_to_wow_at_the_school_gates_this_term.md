We're sad to say it, but summer is over.

It's a new season and for many of us that means a new school term is starting too.

We've got back to school shopping and packed lunch planning to organise and after many months of home learning (followed by a long holiday), we've got to find a way to get the kids back into a 'school' frame of mind.

And that's not all.

It's been so long since we had to do the school run, we've forgotten just how much preparation it requires...

Mornings are stressful enough without worrying about what to wear!

But, never fear. You handle the alarm clocks, breakfast and getting the children out of the door on time and we'll provide ideas for gorgeous school run style. 

Whether you're heading straight into the office after dropping the kids, out on a dog walk, setting off to the gym or back to your new home work station, we've picked out some easy-to-style pieces you'll feel fabulous in, no matter what your day holds. 

From the school gates to... the office 

It might have been a while since you actually had to be in your office, so you could be forgiven for wondering what you should be wearing.

It obviously depends on what kind of business you work for and the kind of job you do, but for most offices the dress code is similar, and while we should be looking 'put together' we don't necessarily need to look super formal.

So, for an easy look that will ensure you're stylish as you meet the other parents at the school gates, but which will also be perfect for a day of meetings, try a midi dress.

A midi is a versatile option that can be styled in any number of ways, with all kinds of accessories. Plus, when you're in a rush first thing in the morning, a midi dress takes away the worry of having to mix and match.

This Tencel denim dress by Monsoon is ideal. With its nipped in waist and floaty sleeves it's feminine but not girly. And what's not to love about V by Very's floral midi? It's perfect for keeping the summer vibes going into autumn.

L-R: Monsoon Maisie Lenzing Tencel Denim Dress (£65) and V by Very Tiered Printed Midi Dress (£35)

Mint Velvet Stitch Sleeve Detail Leather Biker (£280) at Very

And at this time of year, we all need outerwear options that will keep out the chill but which won't let us overheat, so consider investing in a leather biker jacket.

Mint Velvet's version is fab and will layer beautifully over either of these midis.

And why not treat yourself to some new arm candy? This large messenger bag by Accessorize will fit in all your essentials as well as a few extra bits, making it practical as well as pretty cool.  

L-R: Mint Velvet Lou Leather Buckle Cowboy Boots (£160) and Hush Puppies Iva Ankle Boots (£70)at Very

Midi dresses can be worn with trainers, flats, heels and sandals, but for autumn try an ankle boot.

Mint Velvet's buckled beauties provide a bit of edge and will also look amazing with jeans, while Hush Puppies' suede boots will be comfortable from the moment of school drop off to the moment you walk back in the door at the end of the day.

From the school gates to... working from home  

Working from home has become the new normal for lots of us and if it's going to be the same for you over the next few months, then why not upgrade your at-home outfits from loungewear to luxe. 

This little ensemble will make sure you're still a fashion maven at the school gates, as well as keeping you chic for all those video calls.

L-R: River Island High Waist Straight Leg Jean (£40) and Mint Velvet Metallic Star Front Jumper (£70) at Very

The key is to keep the bottom half comfy and casual so a pair of straight leg jeans should be your base. River Island's black pair features a flattering high waist as well as on trend frayed ankles.

Then wear them with a colourful sweater like this blue star design knit by Mint Velvet. It'll really pop on camera but is soft and toasty too. 

adidas Originals Superstar (£80) at Very

Sticking to sneakers is a no-brainer and you can't go wrong with some classic adidas Originals Superstars. You won't want to take them off.

From the school gates to... a work out

Whether you'll be going to a gym, a fitness studio or back home to do an online work out, it makes sense to rock your sportswear on the school run so you don't need to change before working up a sweat.

And thankfully, ever since the fashion gods declared that ath-leisure was a 'thing', it's a totally acceptable outfit (even if you're not actually going to exercise).   

But why not give your kit an upgrade with these sleek leggings by Nike? We love the olive shade and high waistband.

L-R: Nike One Legging (£40) and adidas Winners Tank (£23) at Very

Nike NSW Essential Pullover Funnel Hoodie (£45) at Very

Wear it with a loose tank like this one by adidas and layer over a roomy hoodie to keep out the autumnal chill as you travel from the playground to Pilates.  

From the school gates to... the dog walk

If you'll be dropping of your children and then setting off to walk your other child, AKA the family dog, you'll need to be ready to tackle the elements.

But if you don't want to look too scruffy while you chat to the other parents at school, then it is possible to be stylish and suitably dressed for a muddy romp through the local countryside too.

Denim is obviously a great choice as it's so durable, easy to wash and still looks really cute, so a pair of skinny jeans is a must.

This high waisted pair by V by Very will do the trick. Tuck them into some Hunter wellies and they'll be protected from the worst of your dog's escapades... 

L-R: V by Very Premium High Waist Skinny Jeans (£30) and Hunter Original Tall Welly Boots (£100) at Very

L-R: River Island Lightweight Quilted Belted Jacket (£70) and Joules Selma Long Sleeve Jersey Top (£23) at Very

A striped Breton top is an absolute fashion classic and a stylish woman can never have too many. We suggest adding this one by Joules to your collection and taking it for a walk this season.

And layer over a warm jacket like River Island's quilted look. With its faux leather belt and sleeves it looks way more expensive than it actually is and it even has a detachable faux fur collar for added chic points.

Plus, it's lightweight so during this transitional time of year, you won't get too hot and flustered, even as you rush from the school run to your daily dog walk.
