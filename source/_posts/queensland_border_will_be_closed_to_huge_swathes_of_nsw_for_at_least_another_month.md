Queensland's border will remain closed to most of New South Wales for at least another month, Deputy Premier Steven Miles confirmed on Thursday. 

The 28 days of zero community virus transmission in NSW was reset last Friday despite NSW health officials believing they had linked the case to a known outbreak. 

Queensland Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said the case, that was linked to the Liverpool Hospital cluster, would still be treated as a mystery case.

This means NSW is now seven days into the new 28 day cycle of no new community transmission before the border can open. 

'The nationally agreed-to discussion was that it needed to be linked within 48 hours and we are beyond that time frame now,' Dr Young said.

'So it is about easily linking a case.'
