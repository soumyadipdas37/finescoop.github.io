Jessica Mulroney has shared a poem about 'holding hope' and 'believing better days will come' as she said 'everybody is going through difficult decisions' after deleting a snap of Meghan Markle with her son.  

The stylist, 40, from Toronto, posted an image of a poem on Instagram, which read: 'At the close of this day find the courage to hold hope, to breathe deeply and believe that better days will come.'

Sharing the poem, she wrote: 'Everybody is going through their own difficult decisions at the moment. Let’s not guilt anybody for whatever choice they make whether about schooling their children or in business and know that better days are coming 

It comes days after she deleted a throwback snap of one of her twin sons at Meghan Markle's wedding, after initially posting it on Thursday amid reports of a fallout with the Duchess of Sussex, 39.

Jessica Mulroney, 40, from Toronto, has urged her followers not to 'guilt anybody' about 'difficult decisions' as she shared a quote about 'holding hope' and 'believing better days will come'  (pictured, with Meghan Markle, 39, in 2015) 

The stylist shared a short poem by Instagram poet and bestselling author Tyler Knott Gregson which described 'holding hope' and 'believing better days will come'

The poem was attributed to author Tyler Knott Gregson, who is a best-selling author abased in Montana. 

He has accrued fame as a poet on social media platforms such as Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter since 2009.

It comes days after it emerged Jessica deleted a photograph of the Duchess with her son Brian from her Instagram page. 

Jessica's twins John and Brian, now 10, served as page boys at the Royal Wedding in May 2018, and the sweet image showed a toothless Brian grinning wildly as he stood behind 'Aunt Meghan' as she entered St George's Chapel in Windsor. 

Jessica urged followers 'not to guilt anybody' for 'whatever choices they make' and to 'know better days are coming'

The stylist first shared the sweet image on Instagram last week, writing: 'When I feel dark and grey, I see this and it all goes away.'

She later amended the caption, changing it to: 'I see this and pure joy.'   

The post was thought to be to be a further attempt from Jessica to show she remains good friends with the former actress - who now lives with Prince Harry, 35, in Santa Barbara. 

But the mysterious disappearance of the photo from her Instagram page has added fuel to the fire of rumours of a rift between the pair. 

Jessica Mulroney, 40, from Toronto, shared a snap of one of her twin sons, Brian, at Meghan Markle's, 39, wedding on Thursday, but has since deleted the snap



The Duchess  was reported to have cut ties with Jessica in the wake of the controversy, with a source telling the DailyMail.com at the time she was left 'mortified' by the scandal and informed her close friends she felt she could 'no longer be associated' with her.

'Meghan is absolutely mortified that she's been dragged into this complete mess. She said Jessica is in no way a racist, but the way she handled the situation [with Sasha] was tone-deaf and heartbreaking,' a close friend of Meghan's said at the time.

'Meghan said friends reflect friends and because of what's at stake she can no longer be associated with Jessica, at least not in public. 

After sharing the snap, the 40-year-old stylist added a wistful caption to the sweet image, writing: 'When I feel dark and grey, I see this and it all goes away'

Jessica later amended the caption of her Instagram post, changing it to: 'I see this and pure joy'

Jessica, who was emblazoned in a race row earlier this year leading to the Duchess of Sussex to reportedly cut ties with her, has since deleted the image from her Instagram page

'She has to do what she has to do in order to preserve her dignity and her own reputation,' the source added, admitting that they 'wouldn't be surprised' if the controversy was the 'beginning of the end of their friendship'.

But earlier this month Jessica shut down the rumours, branding a commenter's suggestion on one of her posts that she had been 'dumped' by Meghan 'fake news'.  

Finding Freedom, the explosive biography about the Sussexes written by journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, recently shed light on the history of Jessica's friendship with the Duchess.

It told how Meghan and Harry spent time with the Mulroneys, part of the Canadian political dynasty, before their relationship was made public in 2016, and 'hid out' at the family home when the news first broke.

The bond between Harry, Meghan and Mulroneys was clear to see when Brian (far left), John (far right) and Ivy (next to her brother) were all given important roles in the Sussexes' wedding.

It was there, the authors claim, that Meghan 'fell hard' for her now-husband after getting a 'first-hand glimpse of how Harry might be as a father'.

Jessica's friendship with Meghan was not the only aspect of her life that suffered as a result of the recent controversy.

Having quickly shot to fame thanks to her close friendship with the Duchess, Jessica's fall from grace was even swifter.

DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that ABC had quickly severed ties with her, confirming that Jessica would not be returning to her occasional role as a fashion contributor on Good Morning America.

The Duke of Sussex 'never turned up empty-handed' when they visited Jessica and Ben Mulroney and their twins Brian and John and daughter Ivy, pictured together, according to new book Finding Freedom. Seeing Prince Harry with the children helped Meghan see what he'd be like as a father

Canadian TV network CTV also distanced themselves from the stylist, revealing that it was pulling all episodes of her wedding-focused reality show I Do Redo from its platforms ahead of its expected US premiere on Netflix.

Jessica then stepped down from the board of directors of The Shoebox Project, a charity that she founded with her sisters-in-law, Caroline, Vanessa, and Katy Mulroney.

Jessica appears to be taking steps towards making amends; earlier this month she revealed on Instagram that she has used some of her time away from the platform to work on a project to help 'marginalized communities across Canada'. 

Although the mother-of-three did not elaborate or offer any other details about the project, she did offer a potential hint in a follow-up Instagram Story post, in which she said: 'If anyone has old computers they no longer use, please DM me.'
