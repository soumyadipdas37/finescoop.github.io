Australian shoppers are obsessing over the world famous Toffifee caramel cups - complete with a creamy hazelnut filling, topped with chocolate.

The cult product has been a fan favourite snack in Europe for decades but the treat has made its way onto shelves at Aldi stores for just $1.99 for 12 pieces.

Home chef Merna, from Sydney, shared a now-viral TikTok video of her glowing review, saying: 'I went out and got these Toffifee hazelnut caramel little treats from Aldi... and wow, these are honestly crack.

'These are so good. How have I never tried them before?'

The video has since been viewed more than 55,000 times, with many European followers saying Toffifee have been around for a while.

'How do you only know about them now?' one woman said.

Another person added: 'This is a normal candy in Europe...' while one woman said: 'You can get them everywhere in the UK.'

Many people who have tried the snack said: 'It's literally the best' while others suggested eating the caramel cups after keeping them in the freezer.

The caramel cups have been a huge hit among Australian shoppers for years, with the product selling out every time it launched in stores for a limited time only.

'Toffifee is only available this week at Aldi in Australia. Woohoo! I stocked up and bought 60 large boxes,' one shopper previously said on social media. 

'I hope it lasts until next year when they're available again! Why can't they be sold all year round? There's such a market for them.'

But customers will no longer have to worry about missing out on getting their hands on the sought-after treats - as the retailer confirmed they are here to stay permanently on shelves.

'Toffifee has previously been available at Aldi as a limited edition product and has only recently become part of the everyday range,' an Aldi spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. 

Made by the same creators of Werther's Original and Knoppers, Toffifee features a caramel shell filled with a creamy nougat, a crunchy hazelnut, and topped with a drop of rich chocolate.
