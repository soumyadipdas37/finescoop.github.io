Coronavirus denier Pete Evans has seemingly contradicted himself by providing a 'COVID Safe' disclaimer on the website of his 'healing clinic' in Byron Bay.

The disclaimer not only states that the clinic is committed to high standards of hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic - which Evans supposedly believes is fake - but also clarifies that Evans and his employees are not qualified to diagnose or treat health problems.

Interestingly, the 47-year-old's Facebook account and his Evolve with Pete Evans podcast also feature similar disclaimers.

The podcast disclaimer states that conspiracy theorist Pete 'does not endorse' his own 'opinions and conclusions.'

Evans' harmful views have ranged from blaming coronavirus on 5G cell towers to actively encouraging his followers to not wear masks in Melbourne, which is currently in stage-four lockdown.

Pete's false and unscientific views about the coronavirus pandemic cost him his $800,000-a-year job at Channel Seven earlier this year.

Despite his stance on the pandemic, the former TV star is still complying with the New South Wales government by registering his business as COVID-safe.

Evans and his wife, New Zealand glamour model Nicola Robinson, are preparing to open their Evolve Health Labs clinic in Australia's hippie capital.

According to the company's Instagram account, the clinic will offer 'transformational practices' such as 'cold and conscious breath-work' and 'cryotherapy'. 

Complying: The disclaimer is placed under the NSW health department guidelines, and registered businesses are required to 'show commitment to COVID Safety and keeping our community safe'

'Evans does not make any representation of the accuracy': The 47-year-old's Facebook page and his Evolve with Pete Evans podcast also feature a similar disclaimer

Meanwhile, the disclaimer on Pete's Facebook reads: 'The information on this page is general information and should not be used to diagnose or treat a health problem or disease. 

'Do not use the information found on this page as a substitute for professional health care advice.

'Pete Evans does not make any representation or warranty (express or implied) as to the accuracy or completeness of the information set out on this page, and shall not have any liability for any misrepresentation (express or implied) contained in, or for any omissions from, the information on this page. 

'This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injury whether based upon consumer law, negligence or any other cause of action.'

A similar message at the end of his podcasts states: 'Nothing in this podcast should be used to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any medical condition. 

'Neither Pete Evans nor any sponsor endorse any views, opinions and conclusions expressed or shared in this podcast.'

In June, Pete was invited on 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network.

The program has already faced criticism for choosing to interview Evans, giving airtime to his dangerous anti-vaccination and coronavirus conspiracy theories.
