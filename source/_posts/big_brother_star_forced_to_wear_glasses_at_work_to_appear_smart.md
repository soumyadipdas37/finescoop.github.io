A former Big Brother star has opened up about being forced to wear glasses in order to appear intelligent to her co-workers.

Lisa Clark, who appeared on the reality series back in 2014, revealed on Instagram this week that pressure from society led her to wear fake glasses while working in the real estate industry.

'Fun fact: I used to wear fake glasses when I was in real estate to seem smarter because society and the industry told me that being young and blonde was a disadvantage,' the 35-year-old wrote.

'Well. I showed them! I now need them to see, I love that for me. #Ironic,' she added.

The former influencer accompanied the post with a selfie of herself posing in an elevator in a pair of stylish glasses.

Before starring on Big Brother, Lisa worked at General Pants as a PR assistant and managed a strip club.

The Penrith-born beauty has come a long way since those days, and now lights up Bondi's social scene and rules Instagram with photos of herself dining at cafes and going to the beach.

'I used to wear fake glasses when I was in real estate to seem smarter because society and the industry told me that being young and blonde was a disadvantage,' she admitted

Back in 2014, she opened up about being forced to change her Penrith accent after getting a job in Bondi.

'The girls at the office used to tease me as I spoke with a westie drawl and I ate McDonald's most days for lunch,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

'I decided that I wanted to be more like them so I began to read magazines and teach myself how to dress and speak properly.' 

Lisa has continued to evolve over the years and attended her first political protest in January.

The entrepreneur joined a climate change protest, where she urged for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to be fired.  

Sharing several photos from the event to Instagram, Lisa gushed: 'My first rally ever!' 

'I have strong opinions on many things, but I always thought rally’s (sic) we’re (sic) unsafe and the people agressive (sic). Not so. Every sex, colour, religion and age were here united by 2 things,' she continued.

'#1 Scott Morrison you gotta go buddy and #2 Global Warming is a real thing, with catastrophic results for humankind. We MUST demand change, we MUST NOT become complacent, we MUST vote for leaders who hear us.'

The aspiring activist later shared a stunning photo of herself flashing a peace sign in the middle of the protest.

 'Scott Morrison, we’ll be less activist if you be less s**t,' she raged.
