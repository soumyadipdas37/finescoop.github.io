This is the shocking moment an unmasked man on a flight from London to Turkey throws a punch at an African woman.

Footage showsÂ people shouting and swearing at each other before easyJet staff intervene.

Witnesses said the brawl broke out when the male passenger allegedly racially abused another flyer.

A woman says: 'I am African - do not chat sh*t about my people', before the man lunges over the seats towards her, flinging a clenched fist.

It is not clear from the video whether his punch connected with the victim or if it hit the chair in front.

Onlookers claim the woman in the footage was defending a friend, who the man had racially abused.

Turkish police were called to meet the plane on arrival and clips show the man being led from the plane.

Witnesses said it was the second fracas the Briton had been involved in on the flight after he allegedly kicked off when a passenger threw away his son's paper plane.

Footage shows other holidaymakers getting out of the way while the man shouts and raves, penned in by plane staff, on the Gatwick to Antalya flight on Wednesday.

A traveller who filmed the attack said: 'Approximately two hours into the flight from Gatwick, most of the flight were disturbed by a commotion at the back of the plane.

'It was clearly two grown men coming to blows and prolific use of the C-word from one of them.

'All available staff rushed to the back of the plane to separate the men with the instigator being relocated to the front, still shouting and swearing.

'Calm ensued for about an hour, whereby he requested to visit the back of the plane to retrieve some cash.

'Accompanied by staff he went back up, only to re-launch his attack on the initial victim and be returned again to the front.

'We find out from the airline staff that the son of the instigator had thrown a paper plane in the direction of the first victim which he then screwed up and threw away, prompting the violent outburst.

'Another hour passes and we are about to land when all hell breaks loose again.

'Absolutely no idea what prompted this but it was racial abuse of the most vile kind directed at one woman of colour.

'A second woman of colour verbally defends her friend only to be met with the same torrent of abuse which escalated into the violent assault that you see in the video.

'Some people offer to restrain him until he can be ejected from the plane.

'We land and the police are waiting, he's removed from the plane to a loud cheer from everyone on board and as we pass through security, we saw him again as he pleaded for leniency from the Turkish police.'

A spokesman for EasyJet said: 'We can confirm flight EZY8841 from London Gatwick to Antalya on 8 September was met by police on arrival and a passenger was removed by police as a result of their disruptive behaviour onboard.

'Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously, and do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board.

'easyJet's cabin crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time.'

They added: 'The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is our highest priority..'

Antalya Airport have been approached for comment.
