Liverpool's preparations for the new season have taken a knock with summer signing Kostas Tsimikas testing positive for Covid-19.

The Greek joined the Premier League champions this summer in an £11.75million deal from Olympiacos, providing cover for first-choice Andy Robertson.   

After the Greek national team confirmed a player had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, Sport24 went on to name Tsimikas as the player in question.  



An official statement by the Greek Football Federation read: 'The GFF was informed today of a positive Covid-19 sample on the results of checks carried out by the authorised by UEFA medical service among members of the mission of the national men's team, which is located in Ljubljana and preparing for Sunday's match with Kosovo in Pristina.

'UEFA's protocol is being adhered to and EODY [Hellenic National Public Health Organisation] as well as the GGA health committee were immediately informed.

'The member of the squad who had a positive sample and was isolated for the last 36 hours for precautionary reasons from the other members of the squad, leaves the team tomorrow morning, while the preparation of the Greek team continues.



'The other members of the squad underwent a new test today in accordance with the UEFA protocol and the results will be announced tomorrow [Saturday] before the departure of the team to Kosovo.'

Tsimikas was not part of the Greece side who drew 0-0 against Slovenia in their UEFA Nations League match on Thursday night. 

The rest of the squad have since been tested again and have delivered negative results, Sport24 added.
