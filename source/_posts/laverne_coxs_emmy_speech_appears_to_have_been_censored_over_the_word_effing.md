Laverne Cox's speech was briefly censored while she presented during last night's Emmy Awards.

And now the award's show has shared a complete clip of the Orange Is The New Black star's speech, revealing what exactly was clipped from the broadcast.

After losing in the Outstanding Guest Actress In A Drama Series category for the fourth year, Laverne briefly joked about 'presenting an award to someone who probably didn't effing vote for me' - which got cut from the live show in the USA.

Cut it out: Laverne Cox's mic got cut off while joking about 'presenting an award to someone who probably didn't effing vote for me' during last night's Emmy Awards. It was unclear if she was improvising or if it was a scripted moment

It was unclear whether the Alabama-born actress was ad-libbing or it this was a scripted moment that was removed at the very last minute.

Laverne's full speech said: 'I am living proof of the American dream that anyone in this country can lose the Emmy four years in the same category and yet somehow end up on this stage presenting an award to someone who probably…'

Then Cox's audio cut out for the few seconds while she said: 'didn't effing vote for me.'

She did not use the expletive, but the somewhat less prickly 'effing' alternative. 

Unabridged: Laverne's full speech in full said: 'I am living proof of the American dream that anyone in this country can lose the Emmy four years in the same category and yet somehow end up on this stage presenting an award to someone who probably didn't effing vote for me'

To bleep or not to bleep? She did not use the expletive, but the somewhat less prickly 'effing' alternative

Winner: After a meandering speech Lavern presented the Emmy for Outstanding Writing In A Drama Series to Succession's Jesse Armstrong

The broadcast picked up from there, showing Laverne nod at a famous Langston Hughes poem and say: 'What happens to an American dream deferred?'

'Does it shrivel up like a raisin in the sun?' she went on, before telling herself: 'Stick to the script Laverne, stick to the script. 

Then it was time to present the Emmy for Outstanding Writing In A Drama Series, which went to Succession's Jesse Armstrong.

Fans of Laverne instantly took to Twitter to express their confusion, still unsure whether she had gone off-script or something else.

'I MUST KNOW WHAT LAVERNE COX SAID THAT WAS CENSORED!!!' one demanded.







What is going on? Fans of Laverne instantly took to Twitter to express their confusion, still unsure whether she had gone off-script or something else

'What did Laverne Cox say???? #Emmys,' another shared with a reaction GIF of the actress looking cool during an old episode of Lip Sync Battle. 

'I honestly can't tell if Laverne Cox was following a script there or went her own way, but I'm here for it,' another wrote. 

That sentiment was echoed by another tweeter, who said: 'Umm, what just happened with #LaverneCox was that off script, or bad script? Really confused #Emmys'

While American viewers didn't get to see Laverne's complete speech, it turns out the full segment aired on Canadian airwaves, according to Out Magazine, only adding to the confusion about why the sentence was cut.
