She is used to putting on a stunning display on Good Morning Britain. 

Yet Susanna Reid was left looking wholly less incredible on Thursday morning when a trick of the camera left her looking slightly larger than usual.

The Good Morning Britain host, 49, became the but of the joke during the show as her co-star Kate Garraway exclaimed: 'It looks like you're going to eat Ben', while Ben cheekily responded: 'It wouldn't be the first time.'

Oh my! Susanna Reid was left looking wholly less incredible on Thursday morning when a trick of the camera left her looking slightly larger than usual

Susanna was looking sensational in a chic green dress before she fell victim to technology when the camera made her look larger. 

She then joked: 'I knew I’d out put on a few pounds over lockdown.'

Prior to her latest turn on screens. Susanna disclosed that the coronavirus pandemic gave her crippling nightmares where she would wake up 'screaming and crying'.  

She discussed her anxiety struggles which surfaced at the start of the pandemic in March, and how she has found the whole experience 'very frightening'. 

Oh no! The Good Morning Britain host, 49, became the but of the joke during the show as her co-star Kate Garraway exclaimed: 'It looks like you're going to eat Ben', while Ben cheekily responded: 'It wouldn't be the first time'

During an interview with The Telegraphs’ Stella Magazine, Susanna explained: 'I started to have really vivid, terrifying nightmares where I would wake up screaming and crying even though I couldn’t quite remember what the nightmares were.'

The GMB presenter- who hosts the ITV show alongside Piers Morgan- felt her fears reached new heights after learning that Kate's husband was sent to intensive care after contracting the virus.   

Kate's husband Derek Draper was rushed to hospital in March and was placed into an medically-induced coma to aid his recovery.

He is now out of his coma, but remains in hospital and has dropped eight stone over the past six months due to his illness.

The former lobbyist is unable to speak, so Susanna has taken it upon herself to support her colleague throughout the challenging period. 

She has been doing what she can to assist Kate, 53, and her children, Billy, 11, and Darcy, 14, as they return to school. 

After her husband was hospitalised, Kate decided to take some time off to support her family, but she announced her return to Smooth Radio earlier this month so Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love,'.
