A family has claimed they were unfairly targeted by train guards after they were repeatedly pepper-sprayed at a station in Perth.

Deacon Reed, 17, and his five friends were booted off the train at Aubin Grove, in the city's south, at about 5pm on Friday.

There had been an altercation with another passenger but the teenager claims he was not in the wrong and was instead set upon by Perth transit guards.

'They saw a couple of young kids that were a bit darker... and they saw an older white man ... they saw a couple of young guys and they just automatically assumed we were doing the wrong thing,' Deacon told Seven News. 

Deacon called his parents to come and pick him up to take him home to Parmelia but he was then allegedly pepper-sprayed by the guards. 

The ordeal was captured by bystanders and allegedly showed Deacon pinned to the ground by two transit officers. 

Deacon's parents Brecon and De said they were also sprayed when they arrived to retrieve their son.  

'I'm checking on my son's welfare,' Mr Reed is heard saying in the video as he held his arms out wide.

A transit guard responded: 'Back up'. 

Mr Reed was then hit with the spray twice. 

Deacon's parents Brecon and De said they were also sprayed when they arrived to retrieve their son. 'I'm checking on my son's welfare,' Mr Reed is heard saying in the video as he held his arms out wide (pictured)

'I'm just standing here asking about my son. I'm not posing any threat,' he said before he was also pulled to the ground. 

Deacon's parents claim the guards failed to speak to them about their son and instead immediately sprung to action.

'They didn't even talk to us ... they just proceeded to come over, shout and then spray,' Mr Reed said.

His wife added: 'If the boys had been rowdy or whatever we wanted to know but they didn't even give us the opportunity.'

The family claim they are still suffering from the effects of the pepper spray. 

The incident is not a police matter and the Public Transport Authority must decide whether to take action. 

A PTA spokesman told The West Australian the pepper spray was used after teenagers 'abused' guards and 'resisted' getting off the train.

The spokesman said the teenagers were seen 'behaving in an antisocial manner' and added a full review of the incident would be conducted.
