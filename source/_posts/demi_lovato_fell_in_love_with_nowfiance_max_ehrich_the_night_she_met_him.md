Adding: 'And I'm not as f****d as I thought I was. And it's a great conclusion, especially in times when you're having to force yourself to be in such solitude.'

'Just trying to find some serenity and peace at such heightened times. And it's really cool to learn that about yourself. I'm pretty grateful for that. I've learned that I'm driven. I do the work and I really am a fighter and I work daily at making my life better, and happier and more peaceful,' she said during her interview on SiriusXM.

'These are unprecedented times and we really need to take care of our mental health, because it is just as important as our physical health,' she said when talking about her new song OK Not To Be OK with Marshmello.

Demi said she its a process to try and figure out 'your new sound for a new chapter in your life.'

The star said: 'You have to imagine I've been out of the spotlight for a while. So I have, I've accumulated a lot of songs, a lot of music I have to narrow down, then pick the ones that best represent my life today.'

'And some of those may not be the ones that I necessarily thought I was going to release a year ago. So, it's, it's interesting. It's taken a new approach, but definitely I will be releasing new music as well in the next month or so, because there's just a lot of things happening in the world.'

'And you know, we're running at a time to really try to change the direction of the path that we're on,' Demi added.

The songstress said that her video for her single i love ME has several Easter Eggs, which are hidden messages in her interview with SiriusXM's Geronimo.

She noted that the song has two important meanings 'because that not was that a powerful anthem of self-love, but it was also the night that I released it. I also met my fiance whose initials happened to be M E which I have tattooed on my ring finger that I got last summer.'

The artist said 'It's kismet, it's magical and so important to me.'

Demi ’s interview with SiriusXM’s Geronimo will air Saturday, September 12 on SiriusXM’s BPM at 7:30 pm ET and her interview with SiriusXM’s The Morning Mash Up will air on Monday morning.
