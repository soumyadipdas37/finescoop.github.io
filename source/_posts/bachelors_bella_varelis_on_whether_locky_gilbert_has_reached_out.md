Bella Varelis was unceremoniously dumped by Locky Gilbert in one of the most brutal Bachelor break-ups on Thursday night. 

And speaking to Vogue magazine on Friday, the brunette revealed that neither Locky, 31, or winner Irena Srbinovska have been in touch since the show wrapped.

The 25-year-old marketing consultant said that while it 'would have been lovely' if he reached out, no contact is probably 'for the best'.

'Look, I think it would have been lovely if Locky had reached out. It just would have been nice,' Bella began.

'But at the same time, I think the closure in itself was just being aware of the fact that I deserve to find someone that knows they love me and knows they want to be with me,' she continued.

Bella added that there's no bad blood between herself and Irena, and is hoping that she will find her own happily ever after soon.

On Thursday's finale episode, a heartbroken Bella stormed off when Locky told her he had chosen to be with her love rival and enemy, Irena, 31.   

Locky burst into tears and gasped for air as he delivered the shocking news to Bella, saying he needed 'more certainty' in a relationship. 

'I fell in love with you the first day I saw you, and I saw those big brown eyes,' he said in an emotion-filled speech.

'Like, they just make me go crazy. And when I told you I love you, I meant every single word.  

'I know you don't sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty.' 

Upon hearing the news, Bella looked at Locky - who had declared his love for her a day earlier - in utter disbelief. 

Heartbroken: Bella was left devastated from the crippling blow 

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added.

'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me,' she said in shock. 

After he responded by saying he was in love with her, Bella added: 'Well, why not follow through with a relationship, then?' 

Horrified: Bella swiftly ran away from Locky, who was still tearful as she left him on his own

He went on: 'Because I asked you in the pool "What do you see our next year looking like?" And you were so... I needed a little bit more.'

Furiously, she responded: 'You can't turn this around on me.'

She then stormed off, stating: 'My God... Can I leave. I'm going.' 

Heartbroken: Bella then ran away in tears, shaking over what had just happened
