Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has revealed that the club are expecting to receive an offer for Thiago Alcantara 'in the next few days'.

Thiago has been heavily linked with a move to Liverpool, and Rummenigge admitted that the 29-year-old is seeking a fresh challenge as he enters the latter stages of his career.

Rummenigge told Welt Am Sonntag: 'We are expecting an offer from another club in the next few days.

Rummenigge says that Thiago wishes to 'try something new' in the latter stages of his career

'He told us that at the end of his career, he would like to try something new.'

Thiago has been at Bayern since 2013 and has enjoyed much success at the club, winning the Champions League, seven Bundesliga titles and four DFB-Pokals.

Bayern value Thiago at £29million, and Liverpool would certainly benefit from his creativity in midfield.

Liverpool have been rather quiet in the transfer market so far, with their only signing being left back Kostas Tsimikas, who joined from Olympiacos.

While Liverpool can call upon the likes of Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Naby Keita, Georginio Wijnaldum, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Milner and Curtis Jones as midfield options, the arrival of Thiago would provide Jurgen Klopp's side with an extremely useful option.

Thiago starred in Bayern's recent Champions League final success but the difficulty for Liverpool is that with the player out of contract next summer, they could negotiate a free transfer with him and his agent as early as January. 

The former Barcelona midfielder is the kind of high quality that Klopp is targeting as he looks to successfully defend their Premier League crown in 2020-21. 

Liverpool have also been linked with a move for Watford's £40million-rated winger Ismaila Sarr.
