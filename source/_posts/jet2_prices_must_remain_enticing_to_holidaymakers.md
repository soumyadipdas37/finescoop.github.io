Prices must remain 'enticing' to attract cautious holidaymakers as more countries are added to the UK's coronavirus quarantine list, Jet2's owner said. 

Dart Group said winter 2020-21 bookings have yet to match capacity cuts, although bookings for summer 2021 are 'encouraging'. 

Suffering: Travel firms have been affected by the number of countries being placed on Britain's quarantine list

Travel firms have been affected by the number of countries being placed on Britain's quarantine list, with confirmation expected imminently that Portugal will be added again. 

Wales and Scotland have imposed measures for arrivals from Greece. 

Despite these 'setbacks', Dart has been satisfied with how well it is filling its places since resuming flights on July 15.
