They have recently celebrated TOWIE's 10th anniversary. 

And Frankie Sims toasted the milestone with champagne as she enjoyed a boozy picnic with Harry Derbidge and his fiancé Dean Rowland in Essex on Thursday.

The reality star, 25, put on a busty display in a plunging baby blue bodysuit which she teamed with linen trousers.

Frankie complemented her blue ensemble with snakeskin print sandals and wore her blonde locks in soft waves. 

Harry, meanwhile, rocked a white T-shirt, shorts and a black Dior saddle bag. 

The trio looked like they were making the most of the September sunshine as they enjoyed their drinks on a picnic blanket and took selfies.

Harry and Dean became engaged in August last year, with his cousin Amy Childs throwing them a lavish surprise party. 

The former TOWIE star wrote at the time: 'We're getting MARRIED I’m still in shock thank you everyone who was apart of our special day ❤️ love you more then anything @mrdeanrowland.'

It comes as Amy and Harry's ex Bobby Norris settled their six-year feud for TOWIE's 10th anniversary.

Bobby, 34, who used to date Harry, said that he has no ill-feeling and they both made 'b*tchy comments' when Harry cheated on Bobby with his ex-boyfriend during their romance. 

The duo confronted each other over their long-running row, and decided to lay their spat to rest after TOWIE original Amy made her return to the show. 

Discussing their fall out, Bobby was keen to acknowledge that 'feud is quite a strong word' but that 'we didn't remain BFFs'.

Speaking to Fubar host Stephen Leng about their dispute, Bobby said: 'There's kind of no ill feeling my side. It's great to have her back on the show.

He continued: 'I'm one of them people babe, I don't harbour grudges with anyone and it was never really our problem. 

'I would never hold it against her what happened between me and her cousin and vice versa.'
