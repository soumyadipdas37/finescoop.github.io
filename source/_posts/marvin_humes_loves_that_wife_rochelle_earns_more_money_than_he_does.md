Marvin Humes claimed he loves the fact wife Rochelle earns more money than him.

The JLS star, 35, spoke candidly about the singer, 31, during an appearance on Friday's edition of Loose Women alongside Mark Wright and Olly Murs.

Taking part in a Soccer Aid for Unicef special on the show, dubbed Loose Women & Men, Marvin said: 'I'm buzzing that Roch earns more money than me. We're lucky with what we do, we've had a busy few weeks. 

'It's nice for the girls seeing their mum doing so well': Marvin Humes admitted on Friday's Loose Women that he loves the fact wife Rochelle earns more money than he does

'Growing up, both my mum and dad did the same amount of hours, so I've grown up with my mum and dad earning equally. 

'It's nice for the girls seeing their mum doing so well and working so hard for what she wants, it's no problem at all.'

Rochelle is currently expecting their third baby, a son, in four weeks, and Marvin joked that even if she was due to give birth in 48 hours he would still head out to the Old Trafford to play in the charity football match.

He jokingly told Mark: '100 per cent. I don’t know how many years of this I’ve got left. Sorry, Roch!'

Olly also detailed how his girlfriend Amelia Tank was the main breadwinner for their household as he said the coronavirus pandemic has left him unemployed.

'At the moment, work is cancelled at the moment, I'm not doing anything. I'm self-employed, so at the moment, she's paying the bills,' he admitted.

While Mark said of wife Michelle Keegan: 'My wife works half and does very well. But when it comes to dating, going out, I insist on paying the bill. I don't know why, I always insist. 

'So maybe it's the old fashioned way. When I was young, i don't remember my mum working so much, she was a great housewife, now she wants to work more than she used to do, she wants to try new thing. '

Rochelle and Marvin married in 2012 at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, and they share daughters Alaia-Mai, seven, and Valentina, three. 

The couple are expecting their first son in October 2020 and recently held a baby shower celebrating the impending birth.

In an interview with Loose Women, Rochelle joked: 'Every time I go for a scan, I get them to double check his bits because I'm just not convinced I make boys!'
