Netflix has acquired Maclom & Marie, a film starring Zendaya and John David Washington that was shot secretly during quarantine, for a whopping $30 million.

A number of buyers watched promo footage from the film, including HBO and Amazon who were potential buyers, according to Deadline. 

The $30 million acquisition is the largest price ever paid for a film acquisition out of a film festival, with the deal struck at the Toronto International Film Festival, which has largely gone virtual/digital this year.

The film was also pursued by a number of other buyers, including Searchlight, MGM, Apple, A24 and Focus Features.

The story follows a filmmaker (Washington) who returns home with his girlfriend (Zendaya) following a whirlwind premiere of his movie.

As the filmmaker awaits the film's imminent critical and commercial success, revelations come out about the couple that tests their relationship's strength.

The film was written and directed by Sam Levinson, the son of director Barry Levinson who also created Zendaya's HBO series Euphoria. 

 'I am so grateful to this cast and crew, many of whom are my Euphoria family, for coming together during such uncertain times,' Levinson said in a statement.

'We felt privileged to be able to make this film together and we did so with a lot of love,' he added.

'We are all thrilled that it has ended up with Netflix which is unparalleled in allowing filmmakers the freedom to tell their stories that reach audiences all over the world,' he concluded.

The film reportedly came about after production shut down on the second season of Euphoria, with Zendaya asking Levinson to write and direct a movie with her during quarantine.

Filming took place between June 17 and July 2 at Feldman Architecture’s Caterpillar House, an environmentally conscious glass architectural marvel in Carmel, CA.
