Piers Morgan enjoyed a family reunion on Saturday, as he saw his brothers Jeremy and Rupert for the first time in 2020.

The TV presenter, 55, smiled brightly as he posed beside his siblings and held his beer up in celebration for a photo he shared via Instagram.

Standing outside The Royal Oak pub, which had a rustic feel to it that was sure to feel homely for patrons, Piers and his brothers enjoyed the sunny weather.

Piers put on a casual display as he paired a dark blue shirt with matching trousers, while his brothers looked equally relaxed in their attire. 

Gushing about their outing, Piers wrote: 'Brothers... reunited for first time this year.'

Piers regularly goes on outings at his local pub, and shared a picture from there just two weeks ago when he enjoyed a drink with his son Spencer.

The pair posed for a selfie in the pub garden, as Piers wrote: 'Celebrating my 40th year of drinking in this pub. That’s a LOT of Harvey’s....'

Piers' pub outing comes after he embarked on a strict new diet plan in a bid to shape up after a summer of over indulging on wine and cheese. 

The GMB presenter has revealed he's employed personal trainer Sarah Lindsay and reduced his alcohol intake to help shed the pounds. 

Speaking about his new diet, Piers - who is married to journalist Celia Walden - said: 'I'm going to see a new personal trainer, and unfortunately Celia's taken it all quite seriously.

'So suddenly it's all the good stuff's gone and all the kale's come in and the quinoa and vegetables. A lot of vegetables. A lot of salmon.

'A lot less Bordeaux - I'm down to one glass a night. And, well, during the summer, a lot of cheese went down my gullet, and and it could stretch to a bottle of red. Quite comfortably ... Depending on the quality, and maybe a little more.'

Piers jetted off on his annual holiday to France this summer where he regularly shared pictures enjoying lavish lunches and the odd glass of wine.
