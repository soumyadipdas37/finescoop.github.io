She has been staying in the Hamptons during the coronavirus lockdown with her boyfriend of three years Jack Brinkley-Cook and his famous family. 

But Nina Agdal went solo on Thursday as she enjoyed a shopping trip to Unsubscribed in East Hampton, New York. 

The 28-year-old Danish model embraced the summertime weather as she donned a chic white summer dress for her outing.

Her white shift dress was decorated with lace detailing and thin straps. 

She teamed her look with slide on silver strap sandals and a beige tote on her shoulder. 

Nina was sure to wear a grey, white and orange geometric print face mask as they are still required in the state amid the pandemic. 

The fashion model also carried a large bouquet of sunflowers as she exited the shop.

She removed her mask as she beamed a bright smile and posed for photos on the brick-lined walkway. 

Inside the shop, Nina wore a different outfit in white cuffed pants and a pink crewneck sweatshirt. 

She seemed to enjoy a series of pieces from the store, including a beige shift dress that she held up to herself in front of a mirror.

Earlier this summer, her boyfriend's model mom Christie Brinkley discussed how their quarantine crew is keeping busy in lockdown.  

Brinkley said they are working on their gardening skills and managing some live animals. 

'This morning we were just looking, we’re getting cucumbers, peppers, and tomatoes are ready to burst,' she told Extra.

Adding: 'We had to introduce them to each other and they really do have a pecking order.'  

The group staying together also includes Christie's daughters Sailor Brinkley-Cooka and Alexa Ray Joel, and their respective partners Ben Sonse, and Ryan Gleason. 

The group is doing well as Christie said 'We’re doing very well. We count our blessings. We’re healthy and that’s what’s the most important, and then we’re together and that’s wonderful.'

Between Christie, and her daughters, who famously appeared in the SI Swimsuit Issue together, there are four SI Swimsuit models in the house as Nina has joined the family. 

The crew recently took a boat out from their Hamptons home to a deserted beach to celebrate Sailor's 22nd birthday. 

Christie was spotted in a one piece on the boat and shared photos of the outing to Instagram, showing off her figure.
