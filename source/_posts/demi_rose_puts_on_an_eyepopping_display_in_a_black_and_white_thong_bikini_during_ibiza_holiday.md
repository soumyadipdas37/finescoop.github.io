She's been living it up in the sunshine for much of the late summer, after jetting off for a post-lockdown break in Ibiza.

And Demi Rose showed off some more of the eye-catching swimwear packed into her suitcase on Tuesday, when she took to Instagram to share sizzling bikini snaps.

The 24-year-old model wowed as she posed up a storm in a skimpy white strapless top, which she teamed with a pair of black thong bottoms.

The curvaceous beauty complemented her barely-there ensemble with a pair of puffy chiffon sleeve attachments, while she accessorised with a long gold crucifix.

Wearing her raven locks in a French plait, the West Midlands native attached a string of black feathers to her hair, while she highlighted her good looks with bold makeup.

Captioning the selection of images, which showed the social media sensation posing to proudly display her voluptuous frame, she wrote: 'You have my attention.'

While things might seem perfect, her Twitter account told different tale and Demi lamented that she has been marked after being stung by a jellyfish.

She penned that she was disappointed that she couldn't enjoy a peaceful swim without jellyfish surrounding her. 

'It was my first time getting stung a week ago and I'm just like ffs these marks need to go... Basically I don’t like Jellyfish' she wrote. 

Demi added: 'It’s Jelly season over here in ibiza and it’s just impossible to swim without getting stung'.

Despite the prospect of two weeks behind closed doors upon her return to the UK - the result of tightening travel restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 - Demi still seems to be smiling.

Spain had been among of a number of 'air-bridge' countries considered to be safe for quarantine-free travel, promoting many stars to book getaways, but a spike in coronavirus cases across the country has prompted a change in policy.

Before her trip to Ibiza, the Birmingham native had been isolating in her London flat after the novel coronavirus pandemic scuppered her travel plans for March - much to her displeasure.

Taking to social media at the time, the brunette lamented: 'All I have with me is crochet stuff and bikinis. I'm sick of wearing all the other stuff that I bought that is loungey.'

Woah mama! Demi was one again keen to put her best assets on display as she posed up a storm for a sizzling snap on Sunday
