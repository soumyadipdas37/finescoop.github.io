Edinson Cavani may have been released from Paris Saint-Germain this summer but it looks like he has still found a way to keep on his toes as he looks for a new club.

The Uruguay striker has spent time in his homeland practising ballet in a bid to promote the form of dance to boys and break the stereotypes surrounding the art and its perceived lack of macho status.

At the Uruguay National Ballet school in Montevideo, the 33-year-old donned tights and claimed boy or girl, people should be comfortable following their dreams.

Edinson Cavani has been keen to practise ballet over the summer to promote the art

Cavani is hoping to break the stereotype of ballet and its perceived lack of macho status

'I don't share the view that every boy has to play only soccer,' Cavani said.

'I believe that girls and boys have to be free to seek their happiness in what they are most passionate about, because that's the best way to be well-trained, growing day by day in a firm structure.'

Having accepted an invitation to train with the school, Cavani was put through his paces by professional dancers at the Sodre, Uruguay's National Ballet company having become interested in the art through his partner Jocelyn Burgardt, who has a degree in cultural management.

'The experience was incredible, the dancers explained to me how to do the steps and when I saw them, I was left with a real sense of admiration! Because dance is something wonderful,' he added.

'My life partner is passionate about dance. That's why when we were in Paris we went to see the ballet where we had a great time and really enjoyed it.'

Cavani left PSG in the summer following seven years at the French champions where having scored 200 goals in 301 games is the club's all-time top goal scorer.

But despite the 33-year-old being available on a free transfer, he has found landing a new club hard to come by in recent weeks, with Juventus the latest interested party to be put off by his wage demands of around £11m-per-year.
