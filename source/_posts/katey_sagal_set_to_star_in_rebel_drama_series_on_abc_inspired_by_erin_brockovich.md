The later life of Erin Brockovich, after the movie of the same name made her a household name, will become a new TV series on ABC, starring Katey Sagal.

ABC has issued a straight-to-series order for Rebel, based on the legal advocacy career of Erin Brockovich, who was portrayed by Julia Roberts in the 2000 film.

Sagal, 66, will portray Annie 'Rebel' Bello, described as a blue-collar legal advocate without a law degree.

Bello is described as a, 'funny, messy, brilliant and fearless woman who cares desperately about the causes she fights for and the people she loves.'

She also possesses great determination, and when she 'applies herself to a fight she believes in, she will win at almost any cost.' 

Grey's Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff wrote the pilot episode, with Tara Nicole Weyr directing the first episode.

'The name 'Rebel' oozes self-empowerment, courage and rising above, even in the worst of circumstances,' she added.

'I cannot think of anyone better to play this role than the indomitable Katey Sagal, who is such a force, as well as the rest of this extraordinary cast,' she concluded.
