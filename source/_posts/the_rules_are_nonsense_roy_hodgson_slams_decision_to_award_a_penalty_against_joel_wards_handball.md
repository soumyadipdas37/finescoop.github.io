Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson was left fuming after Everton were awarded a dubious game-winning penalty after Lucas Digne's header struck the hand of Joel Ward from close range.

With the two sides level at Selhurst Park, referee Kevin Friend was instructed to use his pitchside monitor to look at the incident again having initially given nothing.

Despite Ward's arm being in a natural position when the ball struck, Friend controversially awarded the Toffees the penalty in accordance with this season's new handballs laws.

Richarlison held his nerve from the spot and emphatically restored Everton's lead, with the decision being branded 'totally unacceptable' by the Eagles boss, who pulled no punches in his post-match interview. 

'I think the rules are nonsense,' Hodgson lamented. 'And I can't understand how we in football have allowed this rule to come into operation. It's ruining the game of football, the rules of football are accepted from people by an early age. 

'These days we're in a situation where we can't understand what is a handball and what isn't. It's an absolute nonsense, I don't want to profit form it or lose to it, there's no doubt it's killing the game.

'I will predict what will happen, people will be flicking balls onto people's hands and screaming for handball and if you think that's going to make the game better then good luck to you. 

'A really good game of football was killed by the decision today. I'm talking about referees too, I don't blame referees because he's got to give it because it's what he's been told to do.

'I would have been really happy with our team's performance at 1-1 but we have lost in a way that I find totally unacceptable.

'I thought we were good last week and good this week, we've really started well. We've got no points to show for it but I have no criticism for our performance at all.

'Instead we find ourselves discussing something we don't want to. Instead I have to make bold statements which I will make absolutely no apology for.'

Palace fans also shared Hodgson's frustration, taking to social media to hit out at the decision.

One disgruntled Palace fan tweeted: 'VAR and the handball rule is a total farce and has ruined football.'

Meanwhile, Match of the Day host and former Everton striker Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Another utterly absurd handball penalty given. Ridiculous.' 







He continued: 'It's bizarre how referees and VAR referees are getting these decisions so horrendously wrong. I can only presume it's because previously never had the chance to see replays in super slow motion. 

'Important to watch things in normal time too. Different perception entirely.' 

Former England women's international Eni Aluko was also left dismayed by the decision, adding: 'I never thought I'd say this as a striker but I feel sorry for defenders. 

'I'm not sure what they're meant to do. I get a bit confused, it's not outside of his body line, he's not leant towards the ball but it's given.'

Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his fifth goal of the season to give Everton the lead on 10 minutes, following intelligent play from James Rodriguez and Seamus Coleman.

Cheikhou Kouyate's free header drew Palace level on 26 minutes, but the hosts were unable to strike back after Richarlison scored from 12 yards.

The Toffees now sit top of the embryonic Premier League table following wins over Tottenham, West Brom and Palace.
