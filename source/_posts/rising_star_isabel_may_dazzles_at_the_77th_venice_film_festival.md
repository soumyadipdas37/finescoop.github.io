Isabel May dazzled as she stepped out at the 77th Venice Film Festival for the Run Hide Fight premiere on Thursday night.

The American actress, 19, was sure to turn heads as she made her stylish arrival at the event in the Italian city in a gorgeous copper gown.

Her ensemble featured a plunging neckline and a billowing skirt to give her look a glamorous flair as she glided down the red carpet.

Wow! Rising star Isabel May dazzled in a plunging copper gown on the red carpet for the Run Hide Fight premiere during the 77th Venice Film Festival on Thursday

Isabel's outfit showed off a glimpse of her cleavage as she posed from all angles in her stunning ensemble that was cinched at the waist to highlight her slender figure. 

Her golden locks were brushed into glamorous waves that cascaded over her shoulders, and she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion.

The Young Sheldon star opted to forgo wearing any accessories so that all attention remained on her gown as she twirled in delight.

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on Wednesday and ends on the 12 September. 

Though the event is still taking place, it is a markedly toned down affair to previous years amid the coronavirus crisis, with temperature checks and mask wearing becoming mandatory except on the red carpet. 

Cate Blanchett heads the festival's jury, and she does so during an historic year when the number of female directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.
