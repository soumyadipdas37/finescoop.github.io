England U21s have extended their perfect form in Euro 2021 qualifying after thumping Kosovo with Eddie Nketiah scoring a perfect hat-trick. 

The Arsenal starlet netted a quickfire double after the break to hand Aidy Boothroyd's men complete control of the encounter and then scored from the penalty spot to round off his stellar evening. 

His tenth goal at this level for the Young Lions came via a deft header at the far post from Tom Davies' floated cross, and his second was a neat turn and finish. The third, a spot kick after Conor Gallagher was felled, added gloss to the scoreline.

Reiss Nelson then popped up with a goal of his own as the floodgates well and truly burst open on 66 minutes. Max Aarons did superbly to jink his way towards the byline and clipped a ball in for his team-mate to slam home into the roof of the net.

There was even time for Tottenham youngster Ryan Sessegnon to plunder England's fifth of the evening, and Borussia Dortmund new boy Jude Bellingham popped up with the sixth.
