Two-time Grammy nominee Jennifer Lopez certainly stood out in colorful sweats as she went for a solo bike ride through Chelsea Piers on Manhattan's West Side on Monday.

The 51-year-old pop diva sported a red, yellow, and green tie-dye hoodie, matching joggers, and white Nike sneakers for her exercise session.

'The biggest artists in the world performing at whatever venue they choose, doing all their hits and being able to launch a new single, launch a new album off the back of each episode,' Tedder explained in a recent interview.

'So, right now you can't do traditional marketing - artists, as you've probably noticed, most major artists are not releasing music and have not for months. They're postponing it, which is why TikTok is taking over and now this gives you a platform as a major artist.'

Ryan continued: 'If you're Dua Lipa, The Weeknd, Harry Styles having the biggest moment of his career can go on and do a 90-minute set, do the whole album, play all of his hits and then an interview portion.'
