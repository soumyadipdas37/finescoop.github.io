The model, 23, who rose to fame on the 2018 edition of the ITV2 dating series, is making his debut alongside fellow newbies Paris Smith, Will Higginson and Ruby Adler.

The upcoming series - airing from September 28 - will see the reality stars live it up in the famous London district before relaxing at two lavish country manors after the last season was cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fitness enthusiast Charlie is best known for his ill-fated romances with Hayley Hughes, as well as 2019 contestants Lucie Donlan and Arabella Chi.

Socialite Paris is close pals with Amelia Mist, while Ruby is in a relationship with Reza Amiri-Garroussi.

Last month, the cast were left 'shaken' after a car burst into flames near the West Sussex country manor where they were filming.

Firefighters were called to the scene and while the stars of the E4 reality show were far enough away from the incident to be safe, onlookers said it was a 'really scary' experience.
