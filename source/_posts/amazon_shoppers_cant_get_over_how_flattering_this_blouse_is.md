If you're looking to stock up on some comfy wardrobe staples for that confusing in-between weather, Amazon shoppers have found the perfect piece.

Reviewers say this Beluring Women's Long Sleeve Blouse, which has more than 1,700 positive ratings, is 'flattering and comfortable'. 

With a relaxed fit, the top comes in over ten colours and prints and costs as little as £11.04 depending on what size and colour you select.

It's not hard to see why it has secured the number one bestselling spot for Women's Blouses & Shirts on Amazon. Shoppers claim the long sleeve top is a wardrobe staple and just the thing to throw on to see you through all seasons and occasions.

'I love these tops,' said one shopper. 'I bought two of them they are very soft and comfortable a lovely length and cover any bumps and come below my rear. The fit was perfect and true to size - I would buy more!'

'This top is amazing!' wrote another. 'You can tuck it into high skinnies, wear with leggings or even shorts. After reading the reviews, I went a size up which fits fine and gives a baggy look; however, my usual size would have been perfect. Overall I am happy and will be buying more in different colours!'

A third shopper agreed adding: 'Lightweight t-shirt ideal for the spring to autumn seasons. Looks great on very flattering for different body shapes.'

Reviewers comment on how the Beluring Women's Long Sleeve Blouse washes well, and how it's a flattering option that isn't tight or clingy over your belly. As one shopper wrote: 'I have got several of these, really flattering, especially over the tummy area.'

Longer at the back with a button front, the top is made from a rayon and spandex blend with a scoop neck and long sleeves. It's lightweight, soft and hangs beautifully with a rounded hem for a flattering fit.

It's easy to pair with jeans, leggings, shorts, and skirts - as demonstrated in several customer snaps on Amazon.

And while several owners share that it runs true to size, others recommend getting it in a slightly larger size if you want additional room.
