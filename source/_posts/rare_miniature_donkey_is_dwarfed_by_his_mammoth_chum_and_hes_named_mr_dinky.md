Everybody needs someone to look up to in life. And that’s certainly the case for little Mr Dinky here.

The two-day-old is a rare miniature Mediterranean donkey while his six-year-old friend Benji belongs to the world’s largest breed. 

The American mammoth jackstock towers above at 16 hands (64in) while Mr Dinky may only grow up to 36in in his lifetime.

Heartwarming pictures show the pair galloping together on the farm and even showing each other affection in the backdrop of the stunning Devon coastline.

Dinky Donks, a farm near Combe Martin, a village in Exmoor National Park, is home to several of Mr Dinky’s breed.

Now extinct in their native islands of Sardinia and Sicily, they are still sold as pets in both Britain and the US after historically being used to turn grinding stones inside peasant houses.

Despite Benji’s breed being common across the Atlantic, there are just a handful of American mammoth jackstocks in the UK.
