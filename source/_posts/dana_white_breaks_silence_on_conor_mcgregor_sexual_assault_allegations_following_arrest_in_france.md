UFC president Dana White has responded to Conor McGregor's recent arrest, insisting the Irish star 'doesn't need any help or advice' before offering his support amid allegations in France. 

The retired mixed martial artist, 32, has been accused of showing off his manhood and then assaulting a young married woman in a bar toilet following a heavy drinking session in the Port of Calvi, on the French island of Corsica on September 6. 

French police raided McGregor's £3million yacht and took the UFC star away after claims he 'exhibited his private parts' to the alleged victim as she entered a bar toilet.

France 3 Corse – the major TV broadcaster in the area – said it had spoken to a friend of the alleged victim of the alleged incident which led to McGregor being taken into police custody last Friday before his release on Saturday.

The former two-weight world champion was released without charge and is now waiting for the results of 'key physical tests' and 'the examination of film evidence' before learning whether he will be re-arrested over alleged sexual assault and indecent exposure.

And White, who oversaw McGregor's rise to the summit of the UFC, has spoken on the recent arrest of the 32-year-old in France.

'I don't know enough about the Conor situation,' White said at the UFC Fight Night 177 post-fight press conference via The Mirror.

'I know what you've read. I've read the same things. Conor is retired. I haven't talked to him. I'm sure he doesn't need my help or advice, but if he did, he can call.' 

McGregor has strongly denied the recent allegations, and Emmanuelle Ramon, his lawyer, said his client 'vigorously denied any wrongdoing'.

The Irishman last fought at UFC 246, when he defeated Donald Cerrone in just 40 seconds.
