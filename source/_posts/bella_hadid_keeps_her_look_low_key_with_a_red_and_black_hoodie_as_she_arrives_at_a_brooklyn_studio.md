The day before, Bella was also spotted in Brooklyn when she joined the Sidewalk Sale for Social Justice, which was raising funds for the Black Lives Matter movement.

On Monday, she shared an Instagram post from one of the sale's organizers announcing that his group had raised an impressive $40,645 from Sunday's sale, bringing the total for multiple sales to $266,546.

The group also had a voter registration booth set up.

The model is a supporter of BLM and liberal political causes and regularly shares posts supporting them on her social media accounts.

Most recently, she shared a post about President Donald Trump writing off $70,000 as a tax deduction for his hairstyling needs, which was reported in a story from The New York Times that revealed the president had only paid $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017.

Missing out: Later on Monday, Bella shared some photos from a Versace photoshoot after she wasn't able to attend Milan Fashion Week this year

For a model of Bella's profile, it would be logical for her to attend Milan Fashion week, but she sat it out this year, though it wasn't clear if that was due to COVID-19 concerns or due to her sister's pregnancy.

'I love my @versace family @donatella_versace @pg_dmcasting @samuel_ellis @gabesemeraro Missing you , Loving you, sending kisses to Milan,' she caption the pictures.

New love: Days before Bella returned to the studio, her sister Gigi Hadid and her partner Zayn Malik welcomed their first child together 

Sweet: The new parents both shared lovely black and white photos of the little girl gripping Zayn's hand. 'The love I feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding,' he wrote

Days before Bella returned to the studio, her sister Gigi Hadid and her partner Zayn Malik welcomed their first child together.

The new parents both shared lovely black and white photos of the little girl gripping Zayn's hand.

'Our girl joined us earth-side this weekend and she’s already changed our world. So in love,' Gigi gushed in her caption, while her beau wrote that 'The love I feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding.'

Family sources leaked word of the pregnancy in April and at the end of the month Gigi confirmed the news herself on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
