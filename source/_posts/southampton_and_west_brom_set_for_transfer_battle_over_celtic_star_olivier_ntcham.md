Southampton and West Brom are lining up late swoops for Celtic midfielder Olivier Ntcham ahead of next week's transfer deadline.

The Premier League duo want to improve their squads by October 5 and have identified the 24-year-old as a prospective signing.

The former Manchester City man is attracting firm interest from across Europe, with Ligue 1 club Lyon also monitoring his situation.

But a return to England could suit Ntcham, who has represented France extensively at junior level including 20 caps for the Under-21s.

Having joined Celtic in 2017, Ntcham has established himself as an important player for the Scottish giants.

But Neil Lennon is facing a fight to keep the midfielder ahead of next week's deadline.
