She took a break from work to spend time with her children and husband, Derek Draper, who remains in intensive care as he continues to recover from COVID-19.

But Kate Garraway has announced she will be returning to her Smooth Radio show Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.'

The broadcaster, 53, confirmed on Sunday that she will be heading back to the Global studios in London to record her show from 10am to 1pm everyday this week, after her friend Myleene Klass filled in for her.

Kate's husband Derek was entered into intensive care after contracting the deadly coronavirus in March. 

The Good Morning Britain presenter revealed that she is 'consumed with fear' as she doesn't know if his health will ever return to normal.

As she announced her return to the airwaves, Kate acknowledged the frightening circumstances she currently faces, but hopes work will provide a welcome distraction for both herself and her husband.

She said to The Sun: 'I’m delighted to be returning to my morning show on Smooth and to my Global family who have been a big support to me.

'Things are still hugely challenging and a long way from being normal, but I’d like to think that this will give Derek yet another opportunity to hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.

'My heartfelt thanks go to Myleene Klass who has been brilliantly caretaking the show for me and to all my regular listeners for their messages of support.'

She admitted there couldn't be a more relaxing job to ease her back into a stable work routine.

In the midst of Derek's health battle, Kate has focused on looking after their children, Billy, 11, and Darcy, 14. 

She announced her departure from Good Morning Britain in August so she could help her children prepare for their return to school, after returning for a few weeks earlier in the summer.  

She said: 'Things are still hugely challenging and a long way from being normal, but I’d like to think that this will give Derek yet another opportunity to hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love' she said

She told viewers: 'I’m actually not here next week. I’m taking a bit of time off, to help Billy get ready for secondary school, and my other children.

'And also Derek, look after that. I just want to say thank you to all of you for absolutely being brilliant since I’ve come back through troubling times.' 

She revealed her partner has lost a whopping eight stone over the past six months and was placed in a medically-induced coma to aid his recovery.

He is now out of his coma but still remains in intensive care. 

In a moving interview in Saturday's You magazine, Kate, 53, said: 'We hope and believe he will come out of it but we just don't know. 

'The heart of the family has been ripped out and we don't know if we will ever get it back.'
