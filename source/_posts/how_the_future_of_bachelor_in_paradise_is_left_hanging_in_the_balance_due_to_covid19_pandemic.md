Frantic producers are said to be scrambling to find a way to film for the fourth season of Bachelor in Paradise despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The show usually films every November at Fiji's Mango Bay Resort - however with interstate borders still firmly intact and international travel mostly out of the question, it seems unlikely that contestants will be able to fly out for the series.

However, The Wash reports there may still be a glimmer of hope as they claim producers have already 'approached big names' from the Bachelor franchise to star in the series and are looking into a Noosa as a potential back-up location.

According to the publication, the idyllic resort town of Noosa 'has been discussed as a potential location, depending on what happens with Queensland's border and if they can get the cast and crew there.'

Some of the franchise's 'key alumni' have reportedly been promised that if this season goes ahead, then they will definitely be on the show.

However, stars from this year's The Bachelor and the yet-to-be aired The Bachelorette have not been approached for the next season of Bachelor In Paradise as of yet.

Weighing up the options of the show's future, the source admitted: 'It's good news that Channel 10 and producers want the show to go ahead and are doing everything in their power to make this happen.

'But then it's bad news that there's so much uncertainty right now, and if they get the green light, it'll likely be a very different show.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Ten representatives for further comment.

This year, the third season of Bachelor In Paradise premiered on Wednesday, July 15 after being pushed back three months. 

The show was filmed at the Mango Bay Resort in Fiji in November and December, meaning production was not affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

 However, Channel 10 decided to hold the series until later in the year to prioritise its news coverage of the global health crisis.

Bachelor in Paradise follows ex-contestants from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette as they compete for a second chance at love.
