UFC star Israel Adesanya says he is keen on fighting again this year following his brilliant victory against Paulo Costa at the weekend. 

The 31-year-old silenced his critics with a comprehensive win over rival Costa, a formerly undefeated Brazilian, and the pair had not seen eye to eye in the build up to their bout on Fight Island. 

Following his dominant second-round win, Adesanya made a series of lewd comments in the direction of his rival's corner but he was much more relaxed when speaking on the Ariel Helwasni MMA Show on Wednesday.   

Israel Adesanya says he is keen on fighting again this year after his demolition job at UFC 253

The 31-year-old told the Ariel Helwasni MMA Show that he is fresh and eager to fight soon

When asked when he could return and against who, Adesanya said: 'I don't know, I've got to talk to the big dog. 

But when probed on whether that could mean in March or April next year, he replied: 'What? Don't be silly, I'm fresh. What?! Are you serious?

'This year, I want to fight this year. We talked a little a bit last night and I can't say much more but we've got some plans, I want to fight this year.

'I'm fresh. My foot only hurts from kicking his a***. But I can't tell you yet...'

In a year overshadowed by cancelled events due to the coronavirus crisis, Adesanya has fought twice: at the weekend and in March, when he defeated Yoel Romero at UFC 248.  

Despite his weekend victory Adesanya - who stretched his MMA pro record to 20-0 - has faced criticism for his antics at the end of the fight on Saturday night. 

Adesanya appeared to 'hump' the stricken Paulo Costa at the end of their UFC bout

He appeared to 'hump' his rival shortly after referee Jason Herzog called a stop to the contest, and then strolled around the octagon, launching an angry tirade for everyone to hear.

'I wrap my d*** around my waist it's a black belt, motherf*****' he said, in reference to the white belt gimmick from Costa in the build-up to the title bout. 

The 31-year-old then went onto break-dance while Costa was still receiving treatment from doctors just feet away.
