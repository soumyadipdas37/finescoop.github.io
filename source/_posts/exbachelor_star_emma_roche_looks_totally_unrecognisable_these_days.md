She's the Irish rose who was left heartbroken after being rejected by Matt Agnew on The Bachelor in 2019.

And Emma Roche has certainly undergone a dramatic physical transformation since she starred on the Channel 10 dating show.  

On Tuesday, the 33-year-old flaunted a much plumper pout and a very taut visage in her latest Instagram selfie, as she continues her physical transformation. 

Is that you? On Tuesday Emma Roche looked completely unrecognisable in her latest Instagram selfie (right), flaunting a plumper pout and a very taut visage compared to her days on The Bachelor (left) 

The former reality star wore glamorous makeup in the photo, including mascara, dewy foundation, blush and pale pink lip gloss.  

She wore a black shirt and styled her curly brown locks away her face and secured with a head scarf.

'Starring the big hair,' she captioned the snap.

It's unclear exactly what the reality star has done to enhance her looks, but last year she admitted to getting some 'subtle filler' to create the perfect jawline.

'A pleasure welcoming @thebachelorau's @miss_emma_roche back to the clinic recently!' the Cosmos Clinic wrote on Instagram.

'A subtle treatment of dermal filler to the chin enhanced her profile, created a more defined jawline, and achieved a more balanced overall appearance. Looking forward to seeing you again soon, Emma!'

The brunette beauty often tags the Cosmos Clinic in her Instagram selfies, along with her cosmetic nurse Benoite Boucoiran. 

Emma made it to the top four on last year's season of The Bachelor, before she was eliminated by astrophysicist Matt.

She was known as a 'stage-five clinger' on the show after becoming the first contestant to use the L-word.
