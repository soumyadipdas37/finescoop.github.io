 Ladbrokes has been granted the right to operate virtual betting in Belgium

European competition authorities have launched an investigation into the right granted by Belgium to Ladbrokes to operate virtual betting in the country.

The European Commission, which oversees competition policy in the 27-member European Union, said it opened the probe after rival gaming operators complained in March 2019 that Ladbrokesâ€™ exclusive right amounted to unfair state aid.

Ladbrokes is operated in Belgium by Derby, a subsidiary of its owner GVC Holding, and is the market leader with some 300 betting agencies in the country.

The Commission said Belgium authorised Ladbrokes to operate virtual betting in its outlets in February 2014 and online in March 2015, but then denied requests from other operators.
