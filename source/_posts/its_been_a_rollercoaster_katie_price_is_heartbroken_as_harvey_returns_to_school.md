Katie Price has experienced a tumultuous few months after her eldest son was rushed into A&E after struggling to breath and she broke both legs during a family holiday.

And the reality star, 42, is reportedly bracing for another emotional hurdle as she sends her son, Harvey, back to school 

The mother-of-five already predicts a teary-eyed sendoff for her eldest child, 18, after welcoming him back from hospital towards the end of July and having spent her lockdown looking after him.

Harvey is partially blind and autistic also has a rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi Syndrome. 

He would previously spend Monday to Friday at a specialist residential centre that could accommodate his needs, but due to the coronavirus outbreak, the facility was closed.

Like many others, the 18-year old was forced to spend lockdown at home with his family, leaving his doting mother to provide his round-the-clock care.

Katie revealed she has been feeling emotional as she prepares for Harvey to leave the nest once more. 

She said to The Sun: 'I will miss Harvey so much, we have such a special bond.

'It's been like three back-to-back summer holidays. I think most mums like me are delighted to be handing the schooling back to the professionals.

'I have nothing but the utmost respect for teachers and the dedicated hours they put in.'

Homeschool: Harvey's school was closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but it is set to reopen which he is reportedly very excited about as he 'can't wait' to reunite with his pals

An insider told the website that Harvey 'can't wait' to return as he hasn't seen his friends since the start of lockdown. 

He enjoyed his time at the school so much, that Katie revealed he sometimes didn't want to come home on the weekends. 

The source added that Katie has 'cherished' the additional time they've spent at home together, even though it has been a 'hell of a rollercoaster' for her in recent months.

During her family holiday in August, the former glamour model broke both feet in Turkey after jumping off a wall. 

She is still in excruciating agony and has a suspected infection following her surgery at the Chelsea & Westminster hospital when she returned to the UK. 

Doctors confirmed she couldn't have done a 'worse job of injuring herself' and it could take up to two year until she can properly walk again.

Just a month earlier in June, Harvey was rushed to intensive care after he had trouble breathing.

He experienced extreme chest-pains and a soaring temperature and was thought to be at risk of organ failure. 

Katie recalled seeing eight doctors crowding around her eldest son in the resuscitation room and said she was 'terrified' by the horrific ordeal.

Thankfully, he was discharged from hospital and is on the road to recovery alongside his mother.
