Tammy Hembrow went public with her new boyfriend, Matt Poole, earlier this month. 

And the pair were more loved up than ever while enjoying a day on Currumbin beach in Queensland on Sunday. 

The influencer, 26, and the athlete, 32, could not keep their hands off each other as they took in some sun.

Tammy and Matt exchanged a number of kisses, their arms around one another in a romantic clinch. 

The sportswear designer wore a tie-dyed, g-string bikini which showed off her famous derriere. 

The skimpy swimwear top, in bright retro colours, struggled to maintain her ample assets.
