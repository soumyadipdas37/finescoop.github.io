Love Island stars were reportedly given taxpayers' money to tell their Instagram followers that the Covid-19 Test and Trace scheme is 'free, quick and vital to stop the spread'.  

The ITV2 reality stars, including Shaughna Phillips, 26, Josh Denzel, 29, and Chris Hughes, 27, are said to have been paid to promote the testing campaign by No 10.  

The influencers used hashtags including '#letsgetback' and '#gettested' for the social media posts in which they shared throwback pictures of 'nights out' with friends.

Yet Downing Street refused to reveal how much they had spent on the ads involving 'influencers' and bloggers, according to The Sunday Mirror. 

However a social media expert told the publication that such influencers would typically command '£5,000 to £10,000' per ad post. 

The influencers were reportedly told in a brief to 'heap praise' on the NHS but were told not to 'criticise the Government or its guidance'.

And now the stars allegedly face an Advertising Standards Agency probe after paid-for posts should be marked as '#ad'.

The Mirror claims that the posts have only been marked with 'ads' since the issue has been raised.    

Chris shared a picture of himself with a group of friends before Covid-19 hit to his 2.1million Instagram followers on August 14 which garnered more than 23,000 likes.
