The largest waist on any of the trousers ordered measured a whopping 66 inches.  

The National Obesity Forum's Tam Fry told the Sunday Mirror: 'People who join the police or any emergency service should maintain a healthy BMI.'

They also said that taxpayers have a right to expect police officers to be fit enough to conduct their duties.

Medical experts say that a person's waist measurement should be no greater than half of that person's height.

In a statement, the Met said: said: 'The size of a person's waist is not necessarily an indicator of fitness, or of their ability to carry out the role of a police officer'

Responding to the number of XL and above trousers ordered last year, the Met said in a statement: 'The Metropolitan Police Service recognises the importance of officer health and wellbeing - both physical and mental - and officers are encouraged to stay fit and active, and live a healthy lifestyle. 

'Officers undergo fitness tests during their training and have to complete and pass Officer Safety Training (OST) to a required standard to ensure they can carry out their duties safely and effectively.'

The Met also said that officers are all required to complete OST refreshers every year and that they have the ability to make use of the on-site gyms and are invited to join sports teams.

Their statement also said: 'The size of a person's waist is not necessarily an indicator of fitness, or of their ability to carry out the role of a police officer.'
