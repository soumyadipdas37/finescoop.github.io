Crystal Palace have asked about Fluminense forward Evanilson, 20, and are monitoring developments with Jeremie Boga the former Chelsea winger now at Sassuolo. 

Evanilson, has also been watched by Liverpool and Manchester City, is open to the move but Fluminense would like him to stay until the end of the Brazilian season. 

Boga, 23, is wanted by Palace as a potential replacement for Wilfried Zaha. Boga's club Sassuolo rejected an £18m bid from Rennes last week.

Palace are also considering a new loan move for Chelsea’s Michy Batshuayi. 

Batshuayi previously had a loan spell at Palace in 2019, during which he scored six goals in 13 games.

He is set to be sent on loan again having been on the periphery of proceedings at Chelsea last season but will reportedly be offered a new contract first.
