Paris Hilton insists that until a recent trip to Greece with her boyfriend Carter Reum, she hadn't taken a vacation since she was 15 years old — but countless photos of her in swimsuits taken over the last two and a half decades tell a different story.

In her new YouTube documentary, This is Paris, the 39-year-old star said: 'My last vacation was probably when I was 15. With my family. It's just been nonstop work.'

But Paris has spent decades in the spotlight — and in front of cameras, which have captured her enjoying the beach in Hawaii, Spain, the UK, Indonesia, Italy and Mexico.

Bending the truth? Paris Hilton said in her new documentary that her 'last vacation was probably when I was 15,' but she has been pictured at the beach quite a lot over the years — including in Hawaii in 2010 (pictured) 

2001 and 2002: In 2001, the socialite was pictured partying in Cannes (left), and she celebrated her 21st birthday with a party in London in 2002 (right)

2003: Though she may have been paid to take a few international trips, like this one to the Carling Reading Festival, her claims that she hasn't vacationed in decades have raised some eyebrows

2004: Paris is pictured in a Louis Vuitton bikini in Miami 16 years ago. She was there with her dogs and her then-boyfriend Simon Rex

2005 and 2006: In 2005, Paris spent Christmas in Hawaii, where she cooled off in the ocean (left), while 2006's Christmas trip was to Sydney, Australia (right)

2007 and 2008: Paris has spent lots of Christmases in Hawaii, including in 2007 (left), while she and a friend strolled Bondi Beach in Australia in 2008 (right)

2009: Paris donned a blue bikini in Maui with her then-boyfriend Doug Reinhardt

In her documentary, Paris is shown taking a trip to Mykonos with Carter, where she enjoys luxury accommodations, a beautiful pool, and boat rides at sunset.

She says that it was her first vacation since she was a teenager, but she 'felt like I needed to do this for myself or I'm going to lose it.'

Viewers, though, were quick to insist that Paris' claims don't add up.

'You nearly had me feeling sorry for Paris Hilton (even after she spilled $100 bills all over the subway or whatever) until she said she hadn’t been on a “real vacation” since she was 15 lol ok sure,' wrote one Twitter user. 

DailyMail.com commenters had similar feelings, with one writing: 'ALL she does is vacation.'

'You don't need one when your life is one big one!!!' said another, while one more wrote that 'her life is a holiday.'

'Give me a break.....Permanent holiday if you ask me,' wrote yet another. 



















In doubt: Twitters users and DailyMail.com commenters argued that all Paris does is vacation

'We have seen [her on] hundreds of vacations. She got proposed to skiing on a mountain. Next,' one more commenter pointed out. 

'I like Paris, but she must have a different idea of work and vacations than I do, because I'm pretty sure I see pictures of her several times a year on yachts, at beaches, skiing, on an island...' wrote another.

Paris' definition of 'vacation' does seem to be quite a bit different from most people's. 

Over the course of her career, she has been all over the world — in fact, she says, she travels 250 days a year — and in many of her stops, she takes time to unwind in the beach or by the pool.

Countless photos show her in bikinis and one-pieces in dozens of glamorous locations. 

Others show her partying in nightclubs around the world, enjoying music festivals, and soaking up the sun from boats and yachts.

2011: Though Paris insists she hasn't vacationed, it would be hard to argue she was working when she rode jetskis in Hawaii with her friend DJ Afrojacks in November 2011

2012 and 2013: Paris and then-boyfriend River Viiperi went swimming at the Fontainebleau in Miami in 2012 (left); the next year, they swam on the Spanish isle of Formentera

2014: Paris was back on Formentera island in 2014. She also shared photos of herself on a boat enjoying a mud bath on the trip

2015 and 2016: Paris didn't appear to be working on the beach in Bali, Indonesia in 2015 (left), nor did her time in Formentera with friends in 2016 seem like a job

2017: Paris splashed around in the sea on the Almalfi Coast in Italy in 2017

2018: Even her engagement to ex Chris Zylka was cemented on a vacation to Aspen in 2018

2019: She and her boyfriend Carter Reum took a holiday to Mykonos last year, which she said was her first vacation since age 15

2020: As recently as this month, she and Carter enjoyed time by the pool in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico

But because Paris may have traveled to several of these locales for work engagements, the heiress doesn't appear to consider her downtime there as 'vacation' time.

In addition to enjoying sun, sand, and water in Miami, Sydney, and Bali, Paris has also been photographed skiing quite a few times over the years.

She had been frequently seen on the slopes in Aspen, Colorado, and her ex Chris Zylka even proposed to her on a ski trip there in 2018.

In August, she was photographed on a boat with Carter in Traverse City, Michigan, and she wrote on Instagram: '#LakeLife is beautiful.'

And as recently as this month, she and Carter enjoyed time by the pool in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.
