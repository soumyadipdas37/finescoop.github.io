Eva Longoria has stated that the coronavirus pandemic has been harder for women and called for females to care for their mental health. 

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the Desperate Housewives star, 45, discussed the importance for women's mental health being nurtured in the current climate and voiced her concern for females as they act as 'CEOs of the home'.

The philanthropic star's chat came in conjunction with her latest project and quest for female empowerment, as she joins the LaLiga football league to help provide visibility to women in the world of sport. 

Open and honest: Eva Longoria has insisted that the coronavirus pandemic has been harder for women as they are homemakers and decision makers

Eva's latest project is a nod to her devotion to the empowerment of women through her sport, which in July 2020, saw her announce the formation of Angel City, the first majority owned and led by women soccer team in Los Angeles.

The star created the Eva Longoria Foundation in 2012, where the ethos is to reduce the educational gap for Latin women, and fight poverty in the Latin community.

Following her collaboration with LaLiga, she discussed the importance of female empowerment and detailed how women are struggling.

Eva, who is mother to two-year-old Santiago with her husband José Bastón, weighed in on how women are feeling at the current time.

Soccer star: Eva is a long-time supporter of soccer 

She said: 'Women are being hit harder by the global pandemic because we take the brunt of household responsibilities...

'We make the decisions about schooling, we make the decisions about healthcare, we're the CEOs of our homes so the mental health of women needs to be nurtured.'

On how she is managing this herself, she went on: 'For me that involves my girlfriends, that means my sisters, more than ever, I need my friends. Meditation, we need to take care of our mental and spiritual health at this time for sure.'

Eva also discussed how she has maintained contact with her friends - including Victoria Beckham - during lockdown and the pandemic. 

She said: 'We have a lot of wine o'clock Zooms, with a lot of wine and a lot of Zooms. I almost feel like I've been staying in touch more because I'm not working...

'So I've been in touch more often and connecting more often and having a deeper relationship because the world paused.'

During the chat, Eva also lauded the NBA stars who refused to play amid the Black Live Matter movement in the US: '[Sports stars] have such a huge platform and it's great to see them use that to influence people's minds'.  

Her boy: The responsibilities have hit many women hard 

Pals: Eva also discussed how she has maintained contact with her friends - including Victoria Beckham - during lockdown and the pandemic

Speaking of her love of football and how she finds enjoying the sport in America,a she revealed the Beckhams helped her connect. 

She said: 'When David Beckham played for LA Galaxy we went to a lot of games because one of my best friends is Victoria so we went to many games at the stadium all the time and that was a lot of fun...

'And now there's the LA Football Club which is the other team we have in Los Angeles and that stadium is beautiful...

'We went to watch Davids team Inter Miami play against LAFC. They have the most beautiful [stadium] - you feel like your watching a European team because we don't have that football culture in the United States. 

'And that's the first time I've felt the same level of engagement from fans at the LAFC games. i go a lot to the games. I have so many favourite players, such as Messi, Ronaldo, David of course, Sergio Ramos. I like that he's from Andalucia.'
