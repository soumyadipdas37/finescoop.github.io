Tottenham have real depth to their squad this season but it will be tested to the fullest by an upcoming schedule which midfielder Eric Dier says gives little thought to player safety.

Spurs, who opened their Premier League campaign with a 1-0 loss to Everton on Sunday, could play nine domestic and European matches in the space of three weeks.

'I think there's fantastic depth throughout the squad and the manager has emphasised that if we want to be successful and win games, it's all about the squad and that squad performing,' Dier said.

'But if you look at the schedule, it isn't showing any care for players' physical welfare. It's common sense really, trying to ask someone to play Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday.

'It doesn't seem like there is any care for players' welfare in that situation.'  

Tottenham kick-start their Europa League campaign later as they face Lokomotiv Plovdiv in Bulgaria in the second qualifying round of the competition.

Jose Mourinho's side will then return to England and make the trip south to Southampton on Sunday.  

Two days later they visit Leyton Orient in the third round of the Carabao Cup and if then secure victory in Bulgaria they will place in either Macedonia or Romania 48 hours after. 

Spurs welcome Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday, September 27 and if they progress will play a Carabao Cup fourth-round tie on Tuesday, September 29 and a Europa League play-off two days later. Their hectic schedule concludes with a trip to Manchester United on October 4.
