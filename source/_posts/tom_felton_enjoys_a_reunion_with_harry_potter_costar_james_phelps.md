Tom Felton enjoyed a reunion with his Harry Potter co-star James Phelps on Wednesday.

The actor, 32, and Fred Weasley star, 34, went head-to-head in a friendly golf match, which James won as he posed with a trophy in snaps shared via Instagram.

Looking less than pleased, Tom stood with his arms crossed as he put on a forlorn expression as James wore a triumphant smile on his face.

James shared the same snap, as well as one that saw him kiss the small trophy as Tom held his head in his hands in despair.

Teasing Tom on his loss, James added: '2020 Open Champion... better luck next time Tom! (Gryffindor obviously beats Slytherin) .'
