Former first lady Michelle Obama urged Americans not to be turned off of politics by Tuesday night's trainwreck of a presidential debate, arguing that would be playing into President Donald Trump's hands. 

'But we can’t let him win by tuning out altogether,' she wrote Wednesday evening on Instagram. 'We've got to vote for Joe [Biden] in numbers that cannot be denied.'   

As Obama was making her plea, Biden was being greeted by hundreds of supporters in Greensburg, Pennsylvania - the county seat of Westmoreland County, which Biden and President Barack Obama lost to Republican presidential nominees in both 2008 and 2012.

Michelle Obama posted the plea to her Instagram account, explaining that she believed President Donald Trump wants American to be tuned out 

Meanwhile, Democratic nominee Joe Biden was greeting some of the largest crowd he's seen since the coronavirus crisis hit in March 

Taking an Amtrak train through Ohio and Pennsylvania Wednesday, Joe Biden greeted hundreds of supporters in Greensburg, Pennsylvania in the early evening 

Greensburg is the county seat of Westmoreland County where voters twice picked the Republican nominee over the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012 

Unlike Hillary Clinton, who didn't spend much time campaigning outside of Pittsburgh, Biden made a number of stops Wednesday on his train tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania in towns that don't scream Democratic.  

In both Alliance, Ohio and Greensburg, Pennsylvania Biden was greeted by the largest crowds the candidate has seen since the coronavirus crisis hit in March. 

In Greensburg, supporters chanted 'We want Joe! We want Joe!' as the former vice president tossed his hands up as he came to say hello. 

Most in the crowd looked to be wearing masks, a departure from Trump's supporters. 

One supporter who talked to the pool, 77-year-old Harriet Ellenberger, said the nasty presidential debate inspired her to come out and see Biden. 

'After last night's episode on TV I was so depressed that I thought I should really come out and show him support,' Ellenberger said.  

Another crowd was waiting for Biden in nearby Latrobe - also in Westmoreland County - where the ex-veep will also make a stop. 

In 2008, Obama and Biden lost Westmoreland County to Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Parlin 41 per cent to 58 per cent. 

It's become more Republican since. 

Romney pulled 61.3 per cent of the vote in 2012, compared to Obama and Biden's 37.6 per cent.

In 2016 Trump trounced the Democratic ticket 64.1 per cent to 32.7 per cent.   

Biden's last stop on his train tour will be in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a formerly blue city and the largest in Cambria County.  

In 2008, Obama and Biden won the county by two points - 50 per cent to 48 per cent. 

It's dramatically become more GOP-friendly.  

There was a 10-point swing in 2012, with Obama-Biden earning 40.2 per cent to Romney's 58 per cent. 

And then nearly another 10-point swing in 2016 when Trump was atop the ticket: 29.6 per cent for Clinton-Kaine and 67.3 per cent for Trump-Pence. 

Polling in Pennsylvania has Biden ahead, however recent Trump rallies in both Latrobe and Pittsburgh have brought out crowds that numbered in the thousands.
