Love Island's Laura Anderson has split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom Brazier just days after moving back to Scotland.

Despite initially intending for hunky Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off.

The split appears to have been sudden, as Laura, 31, last posted a picture with the trainer just six days ago, a day before announcing she'd left London.

Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north. 

'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.' 

Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.

Sad news: Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday as she insisted she has nothing but 'love' to her ex 

Laura had originally enthused about her new life in Scotland with Tom who she got together with during lockdown after meeting him in January whilst walking her dog.

The two even went on holiday to Dubai together and hit the headlines when they were mugged in Barcelona, before Laura also introduced Tom to her family in Scotland.

She'd enthused about him saying: 'We live in the same complex and we used to stop to say hi when we took our dogs to the park. I needed a new PT so I approached him. 

'Then one night, six weeks into my training, one thing led to another. He had no clue I had been on Love Island.'

Back home: Back in April, Laura revealed she would be moving back to Scotland permanently after lockdown is over, due to feeling lonely in the English capital

Laura who moved to the swanky Park Circus area of Glasgow last week said she had fully hoped Tom would join her in her new home.

She had gushed that she'd never met anyone like him before adding: 'I'm still going to move to Scotland and Tom is looking to follow me up in the next six months. He's the cherry on top of the cake.'

Now that the romance is off, Laura admitted she is looking for a new fitness coach.

She asked fellow Scot and Love Island Star Anton Danyluk if he would train her now she's back, telling him: 'I'm still waiting for you to train me now I'm back FYI. Where's a good gym?'

Laura first rose to fame for her appearance on the 2018 edition of Love Island, where she embarked on ill-fated relationships with Wes Nelson and Paul Knops.

After leaving the villa, the bombshell dated series one winner Max Morley in October.

The duo were in an on-off relationship, with the stars splitting in December, reuniting in May 2019, and eventually calling it quits for good in July last year.

Back in April, Laura revealed she would be moving back to Scotland permanently after lockdown is over, due to feeling lonely in the English capital.

Speaking to Vas J Morgan for his I AM ENOUGH podcast last month, Laura said she had made some big decisions during the lockdown period and told the former TOWIE star: 'I have decided to move to Scotland because I want to buy a flat.

'I just moved here after Love Island and obviously its been almost two years now.

'I just think I want to go back and live with my family and friends that I have had for years, get a bit of support with the dog if I need to go and do something and try and buy a place.

'I have been renting my whole life, wasting all my money and I just think it is so expensive in London and I'm quite lonely here, I don't know that many people.

'I've always wanted to wait to meet a guy and buy a house and I think 'no I want to buy a flat myself'.

'It might not be the most amazing thing and I'm sure it will take me like 20 million years to pay off but that is what I want to do so that is really getting me through this [lockdown].

'I am enjoying being here because I know it is not going to be that long.'
