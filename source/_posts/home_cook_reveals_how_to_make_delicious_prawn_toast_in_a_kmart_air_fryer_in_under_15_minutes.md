A savvy home cook has revealed how she made prawn toast in her $89 5.3 litre Kmart air fryer after a similar recipe was shared on MasterChef Australia earlier this year.

Lynette, from Melbourne, posted the recipe to a popular cookery group where others raved about how delicious it was. 

'Recipe is a modified version from Sarah Tiong Masterchef Au 2020, recipe makes 12 slices,' she said online.

Prawn toast is a Chinese dish made from bread brushed with egg or oil and coated with minced prawn. 

A savvy home cook has revealed how she made prawn toast in her $89 5.3 litre Kmart air fryer after a similar recipe was shared on MasterChef Australia earlier this year 

Prawn or shrimp toast is a Chinese dish made from triangles of bread brushed with egg or oil and coated with minced prawn

To make the toast, she used bread slices, prawns, sesame oil, fresh ginger, sesame seeds, garlic and salt and pepper to season.

The recipe itself is simple to follow and only takes less than 15 minutes to complete from start to finish.

Lynette first cut the white bread slices into rectangles then chopped 14 medium sized prawns in a food processor until it formed a paste.

She then added in the sesame oil and remaining ingredients before spreading a thick layer onto each slice of bread.

The top was then dipped into sesame seeds before cooking in the air fryer at 180 degrees Celsius for at least nine minutes.

More than 400 people 'liked' the Facebook post and others tagged their friends and family members in the comments section.  

'Sounds good, better give it a whirl,' a woman said.

'Wow I'll put this on my to-do list,' one man said.

Another said: 'These look great, I love prawn toast but is usually really greasy. This is a good option.'

The prawn toast can also be cooked in the oven, though the air fryer uses less electricity and is quicker to operate.

Method:

1. Slice white sandwich or brioche into rectangles

2. Chop up (or process in food processor) 14 medium sized prawns into consistency of a paste

3. Mix prawn paste with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, 3 cloves of chopped garlic, pinch of salt and black pepper

4. Spread a thick layer of prawn paste onto each slice of bread, then dip the prawn side into sesame seeds

5. Spray sesame layer with oil and cook at 180 degrees nine to 11 minutes, no turning
