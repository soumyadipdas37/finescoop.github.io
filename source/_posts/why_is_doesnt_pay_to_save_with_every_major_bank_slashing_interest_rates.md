Financial comparison group Canstar's group executive of financial services Steven Mickenbecker said Australians who lived off their savings would now have to even more aggressively cut back on their spending.

'Even if it's just to lift meagre interest rates to mediocre returns, savers have to manage their money actively or make do with modest remuneration,' he said.

The major banks have all cut their saving rates in anticipation the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut official interest rates by the end of the year from an already record-low of 0.25 per cent.

Westpac chief economist Bill Evans is expecting the RBA to ease the overnight cash rate to a new record-low of 0.1 per cent at its November meeting on Melbourne Cup day.

'The bank is further likely to cut interest rates,' he said. 

RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle last week described the prospects of an Australian economic recovery, from the first recession in 29 years, as a 'slow grind'. 

The central bank is also expecting unemployment to remain at seven per cent at the end of 2022. 

With that in mind, it's little wonder the major banks have cut their savings rates, with the Commonwealth Bank earlier this month cutting its Netbank Saver rate by 0.05 percentage points to 0.9 per cent - the highest savings rate among the big banks.
