She's just gone Instagram official with her new boyfriend, Matt Poole. 

But Tammy Hembrow, 26, still found time to share a couple of solo raunchy shots while on Hamilton Island on Sunday. 

Taking to Instagram, Tammy went braless as she posed on the idyllic tropical Island paradise near some flowers with an ocean backdrop.

Tammy flaunted her famous curves in a tight, risqué green dress which clung her pert derriere while she was soaking-up the sun. 

The blonde beauty suggestively ran her hands through her blonde hair. 

'On Island time,' a clearly relaxed Tammy captioned the photographs. 

Later, she was seen kissing Matt while transporting around the island on a golf buggy.

On Saturday, Tammy and her hunky new beau appeared to be making things official as they shared their first selfie together on Instagram.

Uploading a photo to his Instagram account, Matt was seen planting a kiss on Tammy's cheek while they enjoyed a boat cruise.

'Hey lover,' Tammy quickly commented underneath the post.

The photo appeared to be taken on Thursday, when Tammy and her hunky Ironman chartered a luxury yacht with friends.

While Matt is yet to make an appearance on the bikini-clad model's feed, he has appeared on her Instagram stories.  

The mother-of-two appeared to be pulling out all of the stops to impress the Ironman. 

Tammy set Instagram alight when she posted two very revealing photos of herself clad in a tiny g-string bikini as she sat in the sand.

Tammy's trip to the Whitsundays comes after she and Matt were spotted packing on the PDA at Brisbane Airport this week. 

Her ex-fiancé Reece Hawkins's recent baby announcement with London Goheen seemed like the last thing on Tammy's mind as she cosied up to her statuesque new lover. 

Matt was previously in a relationship with Maddy King - the model ex of Kris Smith.

He's moved on: Tammy's happy relationship news comes less than two weeks after her ex Reece revealed that he was expecting his first child with London Goheen (both pictured)
