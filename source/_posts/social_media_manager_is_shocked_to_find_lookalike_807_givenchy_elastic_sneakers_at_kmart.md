An Australian social media manager has discovered Kmart sells a lookalike pair of $807 designer sneakers for just $10 - and is encouraging fashionistas to stock up now while they can.

Jasmine, who lives in Sydney, shared a video of herself in the retailer on TikTok, holding up a pair of white shoes that look identical to Givenchy's popular elastic sneakers.

'Oh my god guys, we found Givenchy shoes at Kmart,' she said in the footage.

She even suggested scrawling Givenchy on the black elastic 'bar' over the shoes with liquid paper, to make them look even more similar

'They are literally $10. Get 20 more of them. We're going to supply the area with Givenchy shoes from Kmart.

'So everyone in the Bankstown, Greenacre, Merrylands area, stop saving up all of those Centrelink fortnightly payments for real Givenchy shoes and get the Kmart ones for $10.'

Her followers were startled by the likeness and some of them openly wanted to purchase the mock designer kicks.

'So everyone in the Bankstown, Greenacre, Merrylands area, stop saving up all of those Centrelink fortnightly payments for real Givenchy shoes and get the Kmart ones for $10,' she said

'I genuinely like these. Kmart should be paying you for this advertisement,' one woman wrote beneath the video.

'You had me laughing at the liquid paper. I bet people will actually do this,' said another.

A third added: 'My sister noticed this too. Are there any Gucci shoes in there?'

The website Forward has the Givenchy sneakers advertised for $807.65 and they come in European sizes 39 to 45.

'I genuinely like these. Kmart should be paying you for this advertisement,' one woman wrote beneath the video (Jasmine pictured)

They are made in Portugal and feature a leather upper with a rubber sole.

In comparison Kmart's elastic band sneakers for adults are $10 and made with a synthetic upper, inner and lining.

They are a slip on design so you don't need to tie them up every time you wear them.
