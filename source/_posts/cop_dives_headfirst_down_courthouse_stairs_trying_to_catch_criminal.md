All cops have to be willing to put their bodies in the line in defense of the law - but it seems some are more willing than most. 

This is the incredible moment a bailiff at a courthouse in Hillsboro, Ohio, dived headfirst down a set of stairs as he tried to apprehend a fleeing meth addict. 

Video captured the bailiff leaping after 34-year-old Nicholas Garrison on Tuesday this week, just after he had been sentenced to six months in jail for meth possession.

Nicholas Garrison, 34, had just been sentenced to six months in jail for aggravated meth possession at the courthouse in Hillsboro on Tuesday when he made a break for it

While being handcuffed in the courtroom, Garrison broke free of a sheriff's deputy and bailiff who were guarding him, and ran for the exit. 

CCTV captured him tearing through the courtroom before heading for a set of stairs that led out on to the street.

It was then that the bailiff leaped over the banister in an attempt to grab Garrison, but failed - instead landing on his back on the steps and sliding to the bottom.

Garrison managed to escape and hasn't been seen since, while the bailiff had to be taken to hospital where doctors revealed he broke four of his ribs.

The man also suffered a mild concussion, officials at the courthouse said.

Police are now appealing for anyone who knows there whereabouts of Garrison to come forward, so the bailiff's heroics will not have been in vain.

'One of them was a court bailiff and one was a deputy.'
