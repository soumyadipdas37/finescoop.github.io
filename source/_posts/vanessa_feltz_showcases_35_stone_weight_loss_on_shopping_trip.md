She shed an impressive 3.5 stone following a lifestyle overhaul last year. 

And Vanessa Feltz proved she's maintained her slimmed-down figure as she stocked up on essentials in St John's Wood on Sunday.

The broadcaster, 58, highlighted her sensational frame in a floral print dress as she held onto her shopping bags.

Toning down her patterned ensemble, the presenter complemented her outfit with plain wedge heels and a cream denim jacket.

The This Morning star added a touch of daytime glamour to her appearance with emerald green dangle earrings and highlighted her youthful-looking complexion with matte make-up. 

Vanessa previously lauded how weight loss has made her feel more confident and helped her sex life - despite her fiancé Ben Ofoedu not having any complaints to begin with.

In an interview, the TV star explained she enjoys wearing sexy lingerie in the bedroom now that she has shed the pounds down to a size 12. 

'I've been able to get sexier underwear. I love a négligée - I've got some fabulous satin ones which I think are absolutely irresistible to Ben,' the media personality told Woman Magazine.

She added: 'He doesn't seem to have become any less keen on a bit of how's your father, put it that way. He likes a bigger woman with a big fat bum.

'Mine has almost dwindled away, so I don't think he'd have cared if I hadn't lost an ounce, but he likes the confidence.' 

In March last year, the BBC Teatime Show stand-in host revealed on This Morning that she had her gastric band removed a few months earlier and confirmed she had lost the weight in under three months.

Her gastric band was fitted in 2010, and she famously admitted she used to try and 'cheat' the weight-loss procedure by drinking 'chocolate custard'.

In 2018, it had wrapped around her liver, causing her to feel like she was 'drowning' as her body filled up with fluid.
