A $109 moisturiser has been crowned the best in Australia by thousands of women, who claim it is their 'secret' for glowing and 'dewy' skin.

'My skin feels amazing, and this is probably one of the best skin creams I have tried!' one recent reviewer noted.

'I have used it for few months now and it leaves my skin supple and hydrated the next day. Recently repurchased, would highly recommend,' another added.

A third fan wrote: 'Absolutely love it! I use it under my makeup for dewy glow and omg it makes your skin look so silky and fresh'.

Key ingredients within the award-winning formula include Japanese purple rice bran, which is rich in antioxidants which help the skin to recover and prevent stress (pictured in use)

This is rich in antioxidants which help the skin recover from and shield itself against harsh external aggressors and stress.

The moisturiser also boasts ceramides, which improve the skin's barrier functions for optimal moisture retention, as well as Okinawa algae blend, which helps to boost the production of hyaluronic acid in the skin.

'The Dewy Skin Cream is incredible for normal to dry skin types,' the Tatcha Global Director of Artistry Daniel Martin said. 

'It has an emollient texture that acts as a magnet to lock down makeup you apply on top.'

To use the cream, Mecca's skincare experts recommend you use the golden spoon supplied with the cream to scoop out one to two spoonfuls of cream.

'Gently massage into cleansed skin using upward motions. Use morning and night,' they said.

The product is made without mineral oil, synthetic fragrances, sulphate detergents, parabens, urea, DEA, TEA and phthalates.
