Catherine's outing comes after she furiously took to Instagram on Monday to call out a social media troll who cruelly claimed she has 'big fat legs'. 

Referencing her strict workout schedule, the actress proved she's proud of how far she's come from being a size 22 teen as she hit back with: 'I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.'

Keeping warm! The actress made sure she kept warm with shearling-lined boots and a hot beverage 

The Strictly Come Dancing star addressed the naysayer directly as she said: 'It's not often your Auntie Cath gets trolled, I'm very lucky like that. I've got lots of wonderful, positive people in my life.

'You do get the occasional twonk, so to the guy yesterday who said I had 'big fat legs', babes, I've been training these legs for seven years. This s**t don't wobble, and I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.

'So things just got really awkward, really fast, didn't they? God bless ya, darling. Find the light, come on.'
