 McDonald's Australia has brought back its popular Monopoly Game, with its biggest ever prizes on offer worth a staggering $532 million.

Diners have a one in five chance to 'peel like a winner' and score instant-win burgers, breakfast menu items, desserts, or collect-and-win prizes like a $2,500 Visa card, free fuel for a year, and a Volkswagen T-Cross car.

To play, customers need to purchase any participating menu item from the restaurant or via McDelivery from September 2, then peel off the game ticket to reveal three different ways to win - an instant win, a collect to win or a chance card.

'We know our customers love the Monopoly Game at Macca's, and we're thrilled to be bringing it back in 2020 with a record-breaking prize pool of $532 million,' Jo Feeney, marketing director at McDonald's Australia, said.

'There's some amazing prizes up for grabs, and anyone who plays has a one in five chance of scoring a winning ticket.'

This year, the fast food chain has extended the fun with the release of the 'Augmented Reality Real World Monopoly Game' where diners can scan their local restaurant and find special tokens for a chance to win exclusive prizes. 

'The launch of our Augmented Reality game gives our customers more ways than ever before to play and win with the game,' she said.

Monopoly is available nationwide from now until late October.
