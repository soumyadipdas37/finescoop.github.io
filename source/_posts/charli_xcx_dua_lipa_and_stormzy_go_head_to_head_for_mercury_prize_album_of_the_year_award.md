The winner of the Mercury Prize will be announced on The One Show on Thursday, with Charli XCX, Dua Lipa and Stormzy all battling it out for the coveted award. 

For the first time ever, Radio 1's Annie Mac will reveal which artist has been recognised as creating the best British or Irish album of the year on the BBC programme. 

The award ceremony is usually a glamorous affair hosted by Hyundai in London, but due to coronavirus, Annie, 42, will deliver the judges' verdict live on air instead.

Charli XCX gave fans the thumbs up on Wednesday morning as she prepared for her imminent performance at the 2020 Hyandai Mercury Prize Albums Of The Year.

The singer, 27, will take place virtually in accordance with current safety measures, following the release of lockdown album How I'm Feeling Now in May. 

And she was looking ahead to putting on a show after taking to Instagram with a cheerful selfie that appeared to be taken as she readied herself at home in Los Angeles. 

Captioning the image, she wrote: 'performing at the #hyundaimercuryprize 2020 on bbc four tonight at 10pm BST. sick.' 

The singer won critical and commercial acclaim following the release of How I'm Feeling Now, an album inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and written and recorded during a creatively frenetic six-week period.
