An aged care facility in Melbourne has been blasted after footage emerged of nurses without masks or gloves Bollywood dancing with elderly patients.

The video was taken on Wednesday at AdventCare Whitehorse in Nunawading in Melbourne's east for a staff member's birthday

Dancers are seen mingling with the residents, holding their hands and getting close to them with no face masks, gloves or protective equipment.

The video was posted to TikTok with the caption: 'Would have been great if we weren't in Stage Four lockdown. There was no social distancing at all and hardly anyone wore face masks'.

The party was held for a staff member's birthday and workers were allegedly told not to post anything on social media.

'One resident was sad because they can't see their families at all and this happened,' the caption read.

'Residents there are already at high risk. This isn't fair for the families of the residents.'

Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth said the footage was 'troubling' but said staff were likely trying to give residents 'a bit of respite'.

'We can't have any exceptions to the rules, particularly in aged-care and PPE - it absolutely has to be used,' he told The Today Show.

'The masks have to be used during all interactions. That's the Health Department guidelines and that is protect the residents from staff bringing the virus in.'

Dr Coatsworth said the virus usually gets into aged-care facilities from staff.

'I'm sure there will be appropriate reflection on whether that was the right thing to do and management will be looking closely at that,' he said.  

AdventCare CEO David Reece said everyone in the video was a staff member or a resident and no external performers were let in.

Mr Reece acknowledged that no one was wearing personal protective equipment but insisted it was put on immediately after the video was taken. 

He said he was comfortable with how the party was 'managed'.

Premier Daniel Andrews commented on the incident during his press conference on Monday morning.

'I am not here to quarrel with the CEO of that facility but I have seen comments from him talking about the fact that it was a closed event and only people who lived there and work there will involved,' Mr Andrews said.

'Frankly staff do not live there, they live in the community and we have community transmission so I do not know that is the best rebuttal or defence.

'We all have to be vigilant and aged care is and will remain for the forseeable future a high risk environment.'

Victoria reported five new coronavirus deaths linked to aged care facilities on Sunday, bringing the state death toll to 761. 

The state recorded just 11 new infections on Monday and two deaths, the lowest number in three months. 

Victoria Police said no complaints have been lodged so no investigation is underway. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted AdventCare CEO David Reece for comment.
