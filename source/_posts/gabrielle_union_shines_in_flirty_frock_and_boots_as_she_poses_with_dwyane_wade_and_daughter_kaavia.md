In a follow-up post, she shared snaps showing her with her little girl who turned two this year. 

'One of us is in her PJs and @crocs and one of us was extra geeked about wearing a flow-y dress so she could wear a full bottom brief,' she shared in the caption.

In the photos, Union wears a white patterned mini dress with ruffled hem.

She paired the floaty number with thigh-high wet look burgundy boots.

Earlier this year, Union made headlines when she filed a complaint with NBC about what she alleged was a 'toxic' work environment on the set of reality show America's Got Talent.

She, and former DTWS pro Julianne Hough, both served as judges on AGT for one season and their contracts were not renewed.

Union claimed she had endured racial discrimination and sexism on the set of the show created and executive produced by Simon Cowell.
