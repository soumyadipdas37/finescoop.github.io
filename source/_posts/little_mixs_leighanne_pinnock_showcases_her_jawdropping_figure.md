Leigh-Anne looked stunning in her sizzling ensemble which left little to the imagination, as she wowed in the behind-the-scenes snaps. 

She held her lengthy ponytail to one side with gold rope laced through while her make-up was metallic to coordinate with the look. 

Lashings of gold eye shadow and fluttering lashes made the most of her stunning features while she highlighted her pout with nude gloss.  

Adding to the uber glamorous style, she wore a gold choker and hoop earrings.

The British star has wasted no time in racking up the post-lockdown air-miles having recently returned from a trip to Ibiza. 

Leigh-Anne travelled to the Balearic party island for a close friend's hen-do before flying back to the UK for a two week quarantine ahead of a Greek getaway with her fiancé Andre Grey - which was well-documented on social media. 

The singer accepted Watford striker Andre's marriage proposal during lockdown, and she recently admitted she's been planning her nuptials since she was 'a baby' and doesn't want a long engagement.

Speaking during an appearance on The Official Big Top 40 on Capital and Heart, she said: 'So I've been planning it since I was a baby, if I'm honest.  

'I know what I want, and I don't really want a long engagement so I feel like I'm just on this you know? I'm on it.'

Host Will Manning asked: 'So are you being good about it or are you being a bridezilla?' Leigh-Anne responded: 'Bridezilla, it's bad.'
