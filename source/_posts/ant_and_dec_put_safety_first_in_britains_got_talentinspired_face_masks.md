The final 40 Britain's Got Talent acts have been unveiled. 

And Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, both 44, put safety first as they got 'back to work' on the ITV show wearing BGT-inspired face masks on Sunday.  

The series ground to a halt this year thanks to the COVID-19 outbreak, which put a stop to TV and film production across the UK - and the rest of the world.  

Ready! Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, both 44, put safety first as they got back into the swing of the ITV show in BGT-inspired face masks on Sunday

But the Geordie duo looked ready for action behind the scenes as they posed for the selfie in the Union Flag masks printed with 'Britain's Got Talent' ahead of the show.  

Ant was seen wearing a dark pinstripe suit teamed with a blue shirt and a navy tie. 

Meanwhile Dec opted for a crisp white shirt over a black suit and finished off with a red pattered tie.  

Decisions: In the one-off special ahead of the semi-finals, Alesha Dixon, Simon Cowell, David Walliams, and Amanda Holden reunited for the tough job of cutting 200 acts down to just 40

Back together! The Geordie duo looked ready for action behind the scenes as they posed for the selfie in the Union flag captioned: 'Back to work on BGT!' 

Captioning the snaps on Instagram, they wrote: 'Back to work on BGT!' 

It comes after the final acts have been unveiled, after viewers were forced to wait an unusually lengthy four months to find out who was through to the 2020 semi-finals.

Filmed back in February, the four judges dressed to the nines as they came together to make the huge decision ahead of the semi-finals. 

Acts through to the final 40 include an American unicyclist, a frightening dance troupe called The Coven, a trio of hunky string musicians, a 'sexy Doctor Who' magic act and a keyboard-playing Tyrannosaurus Rex. 

This will be followed by the first of five pre-recorded live semi-finals, kicking off on Saturday 5th September.
