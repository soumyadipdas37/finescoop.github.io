New Arsenal signing Gabriel Magalhaes is relishing the prospect of a central defensive partnership with William Saliba.

Gabriel completed his protracted move to Arsenal from Lille this week for £27million.

Saliba, meanwhile, is also set for his first campaign with the Gunners having been loaned back to Saint-Etienne after he was signed last year.

Arsenal have had defensive struggles for many years but there is hope that they are improving in that regard under Mikel Arteta, and the potential partnership between Saliba and Gabriel could be a major step in the right direction. 

Gabriel is fully aware of Saliba's quality having played against him in France. 

Gabriel told Arsenal's official website: 'I know [Saliba] is a talented young player and if he is joining Arsenal it is because of his quality.

'We have a few friends in common and I did play against him before. He is a great player and I am sure we will get along very well.'

Gabriel will be hoping to establish himself in the starting lineup as quickly as possible and there is a possibility that he and Saliba could play either side of the experienced David Luiz in a back three.

Arsenal have a host of centre-backs on their books so there will be much competition for places, but Gabriel and Saliba certainly seem as if they could be the club's long-term partnership at the heart of the defence.  

Aside from Gabriel, Arsenal's only other first-team arrival in this transfer window has been Willian on a free transfer.
