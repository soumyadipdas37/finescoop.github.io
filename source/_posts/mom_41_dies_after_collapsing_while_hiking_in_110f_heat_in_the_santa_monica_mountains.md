A 41-year-old mother-of-three died hiking during extreme temperatures of 110F in the Santa Monica Mountains on Saturday afternoon.

The woman, who hasn't been publicly named, was hiking with a friend in the Tapia Park region of the Malibu Creek State Park when she began to feel sick.

The pair, who had been hiking since 8am, decided to turn around and head back to their car when suddenly the woman collapsed and suffered a seizure, the LA County Sheriff’s Department said.

Her friend frantically dialed 911, and paramedics with the LA County Fire Department arrived on scene shortly afterwards.

EMTs conducted CPR on the woman for between 20 to 30 minutes but were unable to revive her.

She was pronounced dead at around 2:10pm local time on Saturday, in an area of the park near to Calabasas.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Morgan Arteaga told CNN the woman’s death was most likely heat-related and also the result of ‘natural causes of some kind’, but said a coroner would provide the official cause of death at a later date.

The LA County Sheriff's Office did not publicly name the woman. Arteaga said her death was the only heat-related fatality. 

According to the National Weather Service, temperatures in the area around the time of the woman's death registered at more than 110 degrees.

Malibu Search and Rescue, a unit within the sheriff’s department, said it responded to several heat-related rescues Saturday.

Following the woman’s death, the Santa Monica Mountains trails were shut down through the Labor Day weekend until 5pm Monday as California continued to experience record-breaking heat, dangerous to anyone outdoors. Officials warned against being out in the high temperatures, especially with pets.

‘Effective immediately, we have been advised that all trails in the Santa Monica Mountains will be closed through Labor Day,’ the Malibu Search and Rescue team wrote on Twitter on Saturday.

‘We responded to several heat related rescues today, including one hiker who unfortunately perished. PLEASE DO NOT #HIKE IN THIS #HEATWAVE. #CAwx #LAHeat.’

Los Angeles County recorded its highest-ever temperature on Saturday - a staggering 121 degrees in Woodland Hills.

The temperature eclipsed the county’s previous record of 119F set on July 22, 2006.

Despite the extreme heat warnings, some still decided to venture out during the record-high temperatures this weekend.

The Sheriff’s department posted Sunday about saving a 22-year-old woman who ‘lost consciousness’ at the beach, sharing photos of first responders transporting her away for medical attention.

‘Glad we got this young woman some quick help! Please know your limitations & help take care of yourselves,’ the Los Angeles County Sheriff's office tweeted.

Other Crews reported many rescue operations across the region over the Labor Day weekend.

‘We just had another remote rescue for a hiker who ran out of water,” the Ventura County Fire Department tweeted Sunday afternoon. ‘We strongly urge that you limit your outdoor activity Be sure to ask yourself this very important question; What are my capabilities?’

The Fire Department had warned the public against hiking after reporting eight rescues of overheated hikers as of 2pm Saturday.

Before 11am that day, the Malibu Search and Rescue Team had already responded to two such incidents.

Amid the soaring temperatures, fire departments across California are continuing to battle dozens of major fires in the state as of Tuesday.

Firefighters have fought 900 wildfires since August 15, many of which have been spurred by record-breaking temperatures and other freak weather conditions, including concentrations of thousands of lightning strikes in a number of different areas.

The blazes have burned more than 1.5 million acres – or 2,434 square miles, destroyed nearly 3,300 structures and caused eight deaths.
