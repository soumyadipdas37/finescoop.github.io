Frank Lampard lamented Chelsea's lapse in concentration at the back that led to Tottenham's equaliser after his side crashed out of the Carabao Cup.

Timo Werner had put Chelsea ahead with his first goal for the club in the 19th minute but Tottenham equalised with seven minutes remaining through Erik Lamela, after a mix-up at the back between Kurt Zouma and Fikayo Tomori.

Spurs then triumphed on penalties after the two London rivals couldn't be separated in normal-time, and following the defeat on Tuesday, Lampard demanded his side stay switched on defensively for the full 90 minutes.

'It was frustrating, the thing we work on is defending our box. We did it very well at Brighton and against Liverpool for most of the game,' Lampard told Sky Sports.

'You sleep for one minute and don't recover and defend a zone where players score goals then you are going to concede. Players have to get better at that.'

Lamela crept in at the far post to equalise after both Zouma and Tomori failed to clear the danger following a cross from Tottenham new boy Sergio Reguilon down the left. 

But despite Chelsea's exit, Lampard was keen to take the positives about his side's performance in north London.

'We wanted to stay in the competition but there were some really good bits in the performance. With the control we had we want to score more goals.

'We can do better in terms of our reaction. Can we be more positive? I think that's going to come. We were looking tired towards the end of the game and that's understandable considering where we are.' 

It has been a tough couple of weeks for Lampard after losing to Liverpool and Tottenham while drawing away at West Brom.

And Lampard will be desperate for his Chelsea players to bounce back immediately as they prepare for this weekend's Premier League action.
