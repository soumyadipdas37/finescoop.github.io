She's become just as known for her signature leg pose as she has for her careers in fashion and music. 

And Victoria Beckham passed the baton to daughter Harper on Friday as she was snapped teaching the youngster her iconic leg move.

In the Instagram image, the Spice Girl, 46, was seen reclining on a hammock with her leg in the air, while her little girl, nine, excitedly copied her.

Victoria looked sensational in the photo taken by her future daughter-in-law Nicola Peltz, 25, as she showcased her long, slender pins as well as her flexibility.

And Harper certainly learned from the best as she too showed off her amazing pliability while imitating her famous mother.

Captioning the snap, Victoria wrote: 'Friday night mood', while adding a 'Girl Power' dancing legs emoji.

Over the years, Victoria has often pulled off her famous pose, which sees her thrust her leg straight in the air while reclining, forming a 90 degree angle.

VB's famous leg pose was debuted in March 2016 when she shared a snap of herself with her perfect pins opening further than a 90 degree angle - and with her stiletto-heeled foot pointed gracefully.

She later joked that her impressive posture was down to ballet.

'It's amazing what you can do in culottes...those ballet classes are paying off! Thank u @edwardbarsamian and @voguemagazine! Kisses from LA x vb,' she wrote.

Reclining casually on a sofa on a luxurious-looking hotel room she looked sensational in a pair of loose-fitting black culottes and a strapless top, giving the illusion of a jumpsuit.

The mother-of-four originally trained as a dance instructor as her family wanted her to have a ‘fall back’ career. She studied tap, jazz and ballet at Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom, Surrey.

Speaking about Posh’s pose, Kirsten McCarron, founder of PureBallet dance classes, said: ‘You need to be dedicated to get results like that.

‘She has done ballet since she was young, which helps, but for great flexibility you really have to stick at it.’

The pose was later copied by stars including Kourtney Kardashian and Amanda Holden.

Earlier on Friday, Victoria and Harper enjoyed some further mother and daughter bonding time as the designer helped her girl get ready for school as children return to classrooms amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Victoria shared snaps of her daughter's perfectly styled hair on her Instagram page, after working her locks into neat French braids. 

Harper was clearly making her way to school following the hairdressing session as she sported a checked summer uniform in brown, with a white collar.

The mother-of-four also share a before image of Harper's wild waves, before she tamed them into chic plaits.
