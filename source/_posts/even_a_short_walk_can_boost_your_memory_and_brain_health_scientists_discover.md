title: Even a short walk can boost your memory and brain health, scientists discover

Even two minutes of exercise per day could be enough to improve your brain health and memory, a study has found.

Researchers looking at past studies saw that any amount of exercise, even if it was only a short walk, was good for the brains of people between the ages of 18 and 35.

The NHS recommends that all adults should do at least two hours of moderate activity per week but science suggests a lot less than that could still be worthwhile.

Exercise was found to be good for the brain because it made nerve cells more active - an effect that lasted for a long time after intense exercise - and also it increased dopamine levels which helped to sharpen people's focus and memory.   

A short walk, run or bike ride could provide a memory boost in less than an hour

The scientific review looked at people aged 18 to 35 who walked, ran or cycled at moderate to high intensity and then took tests such as remembering a list of 15 words.

The participants, who exercised in bursts of two minutes, or 15 minutes, half an hour or an hour, improved on tests and showed better concentration and problem-solving skills.

The findings come from 13 studies which were analysed by Swedish researchers. 

The authors, from Jonkoping and Linkoping universities, conclude: 'This systematic review strongly suggests that aerobic, physical exercise followed by a brief recovery... improves attention, concentration, and learning and memory functions in young adults.'

Exercise is believed to increase levels of a protein called 'brain-derived neurotrophic factor' which is thought to be important for memory.

But not everyone is a natural athlete or has hours to work out. 

The review wanted to see if a single bout of exercise could have an effect, so looked at studies exploring this with young adults over ten years.

The review, published in the journal Translational Sports Medicine, found exercise from two minutes to an hour improved memory and thinking skills for up to two hours.
