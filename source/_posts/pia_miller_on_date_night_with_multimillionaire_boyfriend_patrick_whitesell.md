Pia Miller and her multi-millionaire American talent agent boyfriend Patrick Whitesell reunited in Sydney last week, after being separated for months amid the pandemic. 

And on Sunday, the couple appeared to be making up for lost time as they enjoyed a date night at the former Home and Away star's eastern suburbs home.

The actress, 36, shared photos of their romantic set-up to her Instagram Stories, including one which saw her 55-year-old beau grilling on the barbecue.

'One of those nights! Home sweet home,' Pia captioned a picture of the barbecue lit up, and stationed next to the outdoor pool.

A second image, which Pia adorned with a drawn-on love heart, saw a casually dressed Patrick cooking what looked to be sausages.

In an Instagram photo last Wednesday, Pia was positively glowing as she sat next to Patrick in a car, after having spent months apart on opposite sides of the globe.

'Can't keep us apart! Two Ps in a pod,' Pia wrote online, adding a love heart emoji.  

With the coronavirus pandemic prompting international border closures, Pia has been living in Sydney while Patrick has been based in Los Angeles. 

As evidenced by her Instagram, they were last together in February, when Pia visited her beau at his LA mansion.

Stepping out: The couple made their red carpet debut at the Academy Awards held in Los Angeles in February this year 

Pia was first linked to the Hollywood power agent in August last year, following her split with her longtime fiancé, Tyson Mullane, 31. 

The couple made their public debut at a Halloween party in Los Angeles in October, amid reports they'd started dating back in May.

She finally made their relationship 'Instagram Official' on Christmas Eve, sharing a loved-up photo with Patrick outside of the Louvre in Paris, and captioning it 'P²'.
