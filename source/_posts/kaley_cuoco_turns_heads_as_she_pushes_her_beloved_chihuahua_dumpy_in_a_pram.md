She recently set up a dedicated Instagram to her pooch. 

And Kaley Cuoco doted on her Chihuahua Dumpy as she headed out for a stroll in New York on Wednesday.

The actress, 34, cut a casual figure in a black baseball cap and jumper.

Kayley complemented the look with white trainers and cropped trousers 

In keeping with current safety guidelines, she wore a black face mask. 

The Big Bang Theory star certainly turned heads as she put Dumpy in a pram during the walk and pushed the pooch along while enjoying a smoothie.

Kaley is a well-known dog lover, recently having started an Instagram account for Dumpy, titled 'Dumps Does NY'.

The bio for the page reads, 'Dump Truck aka Dumpy - I’m a tiny rescued senior whose life changed over night! My mom is @kaleycuoco, she never misses a moment to document hilarious adventures! Woof woof!'

The actress is in town to finish up production of her latest project, television series The Flight Attendant.

As with all other projects, production was stalled on the show in the spring as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.   

And just the night before her dog walk sighting, Cuoco was seen on the set of the new series, shooting exteriors in downtown Manhattan.

The new dramatic thriller will follow the titular flight attendant (Cuoco) as she wakes up hungover in a hotel room in Dubai, with a dead body lying next to her – and no recollection of the night before.
