Manchester United's hopes of signing Luka Jovic have been boosted after Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane refused to deny the striker will be allowed to go out on loan.

As reported by MailOnline, United have been offered the chance to sign the 22-year-old Serbia international from the Spanish champions.

Zidane is said to be open to a loan move with United reportedly leading the chase to sign the player, although Italian clubs Inter, AC Milan and Roma are also in the hunt.

Asked about Jovic in his press conference ahead of Wednesday's La Liga match with Real Valladolid, Zidane said: 'You have to take everything into account. Until the fifth [of October], the market is open.

'We will see. The players are fine and that's what interests me.'

The forward joined Madrid from Eintracht Frankfurt for £55m last year but has managed just two goals in 28 appearances and has been hampered by niggling injuries. 

The striker started only four La Liga games last season and netted just twice, a far cry from his prolific final year in the Bundesliga.

He netted a devastating 27 goals for Frankfurt that season, including 10 in their run to the semi-finals of the Europa League, where they were beaten by Chelsea. 

Tottenham also discussed the possibility of signing Jovic during negotiations to sign Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon, but ultimately opted against it.

United's main forward target remains Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho but, with finances restricted, they are exploring other options in case they fail to prise the winger away from Germany.

Inter Milan's Ivan Perisic is an option on loan while they have also been offered former Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani, who is a free agent.
