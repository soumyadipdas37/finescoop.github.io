BBC One has released the trailer for its upcoming mini-series in collaboration with FX: Black Narcissus. 

The three-part psychological horror show is a remake from the 1947 movie of the same name, starring Deborah Kerr and adapted from the 1939 novel by Rumer Godden.  

It follows an ambitious nun, Sister Clodagh, who is determined to set up a hospital and school in the old palace of a Raja in the Himalayas.

In the 2020 version, coming to BBC One and Iplayer in December, Gemma Arterton takes on the role of Sister Clodagh from Kerr, and leads a group of nuns to the palace, which used to be where the Raja kept his harem and is infamous for its 'wild' history. 

After the BBC shared the sexy trailer on Twitter, fans of the book and 1947 movie were split between those who could not wait to devour the remake, and those who said it would not equal the original version, which was critically acclaimed and won two Academy Awards and a Golden Globe.  

The BBC and FX have announced a release date for their psychological horror mini-series Black Narcissus, starring Gemma Arterton as Sister Clodagh, a nun trying to set up a hospital and school in the Himalayas 

The trailer for the 2020 Narcissus remake titillated audiences with the promise of erotic scenes between Arterton and the palace's hunky agent, Mr Dean, played by Alessandro Nivola. 

Viewers also caught a glimpse of erotic paintings and racy flashback scenes hinting at the Palace's 'wild' past, which will play tricks on the nuns as they try to settle in.

 Black Narcissus deals with themes of sin, temptation, jealousy and mental instability.  

While Sister Clodagh tries to remain focused on setting up her hospital and school, the four nuns are all faced with their demons while staying at the new convent. 

In one of the racy scenes from the trailer, Mr Dean, played by Alessandro Nivola, can be seen joining a woman in bed

Some fans said they could not wait to get their hands on the BBC version coming on BBC One and Iplayer in December 

Mr Dean becomes a subject of desire for the nuns, especially Sister Ruth, played by Aisling Franciosi (The Fall) who hopes to seduce him and grows jealous of Clodagh. 

The remake is penned by Amanda Coe, who recently worked on another hit show, The Trial of Christine Keeler, and directed by Danish cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen.

The late Dame Diana Rigg, who passed on September 10, makes an appearance as Mother Dorothea, who tries to convince Clodagh that the palace would be too big an undertaking. 

Gemma Arterton stars as determined nun Sister Clodagh, who is trying to set up a  monastery in a palace that once hosted a Raja's harem 

The sexy new version promises racy scenes taking place around the convent as the nuns try to fight off temptation

Arterton and Franciosi are joined on screen by Rosie Cavaliero as Sister Briony, Patsy Ferran as Sister Blanche.

Fans of Black Narcissus were excited to watch the modern remake, however, some noted it would be hard to rival with the original movie, which came out in 1947. 

Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, it won two Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction, as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography. 

'Geez. I thought only America couldn't come up with anything original anymore so keeps on doing remakes. Why mess with perfection,' said one. 

'The original was vivid with depth. This looks drab and shallow,' said another. 









While some said they were excited to view the new three-part BBC series, others said they doubted it would rival the original movie from 1947

'Already been done - 70 years too late,' wrote one.  'Good luck trying to outdo Powell and Pressburger,' said another. 

However, others shared their excitement for the December premiere. 

'I have seriously waited for this! The original is stellar and this casting is superb! Cannot wait to watch it,' said one. 'I know I’ll be watching! Loved the Deborah Kerr film,' said another.
