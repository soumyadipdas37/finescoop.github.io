Instagram queen Tammy Hembrow has long battled surgery rumours. 

And now the 26-year-old finally admitted to a breast augmentation when quizzed by fans in a recent Q&A video on YouTube. 

Tammy was only too happy to talk about the operation, saying she felt that breastfeeding had 'sucked the life' out of her ample chest.

'I got my boobs done after I had Sass [her daughter's Saskia, now three] after I stopped breastfeeding her actually,' Tammy began. 

 'I just think it sucked the life out of my boobs. They were just little saggy pieces of skin after.' 

Tammy went on to clarify her position, saying she just wanted to undergo the procedure for herself.

'That's fine. There's nothing wrong with that [her chest at the time]. But I just wanted to undergo it for myself,' she said. 

The blonde bombshell admitted she 'hates wearing bras' and that she was forced to wear the undergarment prior to the operation. 

'Now, I never even have to [wear a bra]. I did it for that reason and I am glad I did it.'

Tammy has repeatedly denied speculation she has undergone a Brazilian butt lift in order to attain her shapely derrière. 

The beauty has long been the subject of surgery rumours, however, she has seldom spoken of her possible use of cosmetic injectibles. 

Back in August 2018, the CEO of DrHaworth.com claimed that Tammy may have undergone a nose job, liposuction and dermal fillers to achieve her bombshell look.

'Miss Hembrow is the quintessential Instagram model for our social media world where fake is the new real,' Dr Haworth said. 

'As attractive as she is, she sits alongside countless other online influencers that have been matriculated in the Kardashian-Jenner School of Beauty.' 

The celebrity surgeon went on to claim that the Queensland-based mother-of-two looks strikingly different in her celebrity photos compared to images of her taken several years ago.

'Based on what I presume to be filtered photos, she has undergone a striking transformation of not only her facial features but also of her facial shape,' Dr Haworth claimed.    

He added: 'Specifically, her jawline is more defined into a "V-line". I would even venture to say her chin has been shortened and narrowed compared to her teenage years.'

Dr Haworth also believes her V-line chin could have been achieved through either 'liposuction or bony chin modification'.
