On Sunday's episode of The All New Monty: Guys and Gals, it was ladies' night. 

The all-star line up of Patti Newton, Sam Frost, Ash Pollard, Danielle Spencer, Erin Holland, Fiona O'Loughlin and Leisel Jones took to the stage to raise awareness for women's cancers.

After weeks of rehearsals, they were ready to finally take the plunge to strip off, going topless for an audience at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney's Newtown.

The women were joined by last year's Monty participant, Casey Donovan, who this time kept her kit on and sang instead.

She belted out the Shania Twain's classic Man! I Feel Like A Woman while surrounded by the women dancing. 

They were joined by male dancers who seductively removed their clothing, first their flirty skirts.

The corsets went up, and each woman bared her bust for a roaring crowd. 

Despite their nerves earlier, each performer seemed to have an absolute ball on the night.

Fun! 'As soon as that corset went off and you're exposing yourself, I could see my mates in the front row and I was like, argh! This is the bet feeling!' Sam Frost (right) enthused

'I had no idea I was going to feel that useful in such a fun, liberating way,' Fiona O'Loughlin said. 'It just felt so powerful I want to do it again'. 

'I cant believe it's over, it just went like that!' Ash Pollard said. 'They should bottle that and sell that emotion it was incredible'. 

Good cause too: 'I cant believe it's over, it just went like that!' Ash Pollard said. 'They should bottle that and sell that emotion it was incredible'
