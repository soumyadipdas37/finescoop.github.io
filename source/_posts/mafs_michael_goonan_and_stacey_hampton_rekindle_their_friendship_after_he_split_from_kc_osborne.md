Following their split, Married At First Sight's Stacey Hampton, 26, and Michael Goonan, 31, became embroiled in a bitter feud. 

But, it appears that the reality stars could be rekindling their former friendship.

'Reminiscing when we were friends,' he captioned the video and tagged Stacey. 

The clip featured a scene of Stacey throwing Michael's clothes out the window of a hotel room. 

He then shared a loved up snap of the pair and captioned it: 'So publicly @Staceylhampton Wanna be my friend again?'

The millionaire's plea to Stacey comes following his break up with his MAFS co-star KC Osborne back in July. 

KC revealed to WHO magazine in July, his failed promises of changing his 'playboy' ways was a factor in their breakup.

'He sold me that dream of 'I would stop my playboy ways to have a girl like you, you're such a good girl',' she said.

 False promises: KC (pictured) explained that Michael made big promises of settling down and starting a family, which she desired and was her reason for applying for MAFS in the first place

She explained that he'd made promises of settling down and starting a family, which she desired and was her reason for applying for MAFS in the first place, but he didn't follow through.

'I'd never had a guy say that to me before. I got sold the dream and I fell for it,' she added.

After they'd split from their respective TV spouses, Drew Bauer and Stacey Hampton, KC and Michael dated for five months.

She announced her split from Michael on July 4, telling her Instagram followers: 'It hurts my heart to write this. It's with sadness that I have chosen to end my relationship with Michael.'
