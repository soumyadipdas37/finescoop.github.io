In light of COVID-19, the retailer is taking extra precautions to ensure team members and customers are safe during their shopping experience.

'We want to do our best during this challenging period to allow our customers to access service, advice and product when they need it,' it said on its website.

'We have expanded our cleaning routines across our stores, including increased cleaning throughout the day.

'Our teams have had additional training on maintaining good hygiene practices. To support this, stores may be operating a little differently than usual.'

All stores will allow a maximum of 100 people into each store at any given time - meaning larger stores will fall well within and smaller stores will meet the federal government's recommendations on social distancing.

Most stores are open but trading hours have changed so shoppers are advised to check the website for their local store.
