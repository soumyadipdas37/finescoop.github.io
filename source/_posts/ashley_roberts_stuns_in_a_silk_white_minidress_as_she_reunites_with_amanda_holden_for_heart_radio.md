She has just jetted back from a sun-soaked holiday in Turkey. 

And Ashley Roberts reunited with Amanda Holden to host her showbiz segment on Heart Radio's Breakfast Show at Global Studios in London on Wednesday.

The presenter, 38, showed off her bronzed tan in a silky white minidress which was embossed with a subtle zig-zag print.

The thigh-skimming dress showed off Ashley's toned legs, while her waist was cinched in by a gold buckle belt. 

She added a boost to her petite frame with pointed heels and complemented her summery outfit with a YSL handbag and aviators.

The former Strictly star wore her blonde locks in a sleek straight look and accentuated her sun-kissed complexion with a polished make-up look.

She added a caption on the duo of snaps reading: 'She holy hunni. How beautiful?! Here’s to looking and hoping for a brighter rest of 2020 #wecanhope #adventure #motherearth #grateful'.

Ashley revealed last month she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future. Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption. 

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29. 

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018. 

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.' 

She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.'
