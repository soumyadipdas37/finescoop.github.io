Wolves will listen to offers for Ruben Vinagre as they attempt to add a new midfielder before the start of the season.

Vinagre has admirers in Europe, with FC Porto believed to be showing an interest in the left-sided player.

The 21-year-old was second-choice at left wing-back to Jonny throughout the last campaign and even though Jonny is out for a long spell with a knee injury, Wolves have signed Marcal from Lyon this week to replace him.

Boss Nuno Espirito Santo should also get the energetic central midfielder he wants this week. As revealed by Sportsmail last month, Nuno's principal targets were a left-sided defender, an up-and-coming forward and a box-to-box midfielder.

Marcal and 18-year-old forward Fabio Silva match the first two requirements, but Nuno is desperate for an alternative to Joao Moutinho, Ruben Neves and Leander Dendoncker in the middle.

He also has a space at right wing-back after Matt Doherty was sold to Spurs.
