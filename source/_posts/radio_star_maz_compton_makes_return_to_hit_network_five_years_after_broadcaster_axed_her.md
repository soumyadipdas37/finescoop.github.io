Radio star Maz Compton is returning to the Hit Network - five years after the radio broadcaster unceremoniously dumped her from her 2Day FM show.

The 40-year-old will join forces with Daniel' Gawndy' Gawned to host the early morning breakfast show across New South Wales on the network.

Maz, who will be covering for Ash Pollard during her maternity leave, commenced her eagerly anticipated return to airwaves on Monday morning.

Speaking of the exciting news, a Southern Cross Austereo spokesperson said the broadcaster Hit Network is 'happy to welcome Maz Compton back'.

They added: 'A big thank you to Ash for all her amazing work on air these past two years.

'We wish Ash all the very best for the pending arrival of her new baby and look forward to welcoming her back.'

It was late 2015 when Maz and her former radio co-host Dan Debuf were replaced by Rove McManus and Sam Frost. 

A year later she explained she was on an airplane when her then co-star Dan texted her a link to a news article, revealing Rove McManus they were dumped from the show.

'So I got off the plane and I turned on my phone and Dan had sent me a text and I think the text said: "LOL" and it was a link to a newspaper article about how Rove McManus was taking over the Sydney breakfast show,' Maz told Game Changers: Radio podcast.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia about her shock demotion at the time, Maz said: 'Of course I was disappointed, but it wasn't my decision.'

'It had nothing to do with how awesome our radio show is and was about the direction the company is going in, and I can't take that personally,' she said.

It didn't take long before Rove & Sam suffered a massive decline in ratings, prompting 2DayFM to cancel their show in 2017.
