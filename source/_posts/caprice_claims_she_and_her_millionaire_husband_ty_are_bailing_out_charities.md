Caprice shared an impassioned video on Instagram on Wednesday in which she slammed celebrities for letting charities down, leaving her to donate thousands.

She said: 'This week I've been upset. A lot of my charities have been calling me and asking to pick up the pieces. They've had a lot of people let them down.'

Model Caprice, 48, said both she and her millionaire husband Ty Comfort, 54, have been helping out where they can. 

EXCLUSIVE: 'I'm sick of rich people not paying': Caprice claimed on Instagram on Wednesday she and her husband Ty are bailing out charities after they've been let down by celebrities

A source close to Caprice told MailOnline: '‘Caprice received a call on her mobile phone from a charity who urgently needed a private donation because they had been let down by a celebrity who’d promised some funds but didn’t see it through. 

'Caprice is sick and tired of rich people not digging deep into their pockets, not just money but time too. ' 

The source added: ‘She understands it is a really tough time, but now is the time to really reach out and to help the communities to survive. 

'Caprice and her husband financier Ty, have literally given tens of thousands of pounds to charities in recent years.

'Yet some people are keen to promote the hell out of charities on social media but never actually pull money out of their own pockets.'

Caprice has been inundated with charity requests but she sadly can’t get to everyone, she wishes she could. 

Talking to her followers, Caprice said: 'It's a really tough time. Some days we have great days that inspire us, instigate creativity, that bring us closer to our family.

Caprice said: 'It's a really tough time right now and it's a scary time but these charities rely on us and so I am going in and doing the best that I can'

And then we have really bad days, loneliness, really looking deep within and wanting to make changes, scared of the future. 

'A lot of people in fortunate positions - I understand. It's a really tough time right now and it's a scary time but these charities rely on us and so I am going in and doing the best that I can.'

She added: 'Of course I can't do as much as I could in the past but I am still making it a priority to try and help people with whatever I can do. 

'It's upsetting to hear that so many people are letting these charities down. Even the smallest bit helps.' 

Love at first sight: Caprice and Ty began dating in 2011 after being introduced by a friend (pictured in January)
