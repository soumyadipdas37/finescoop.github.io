More than $250,000 has been raised for a grieving mother-to-be after her husband died when he was hit by a car in a self-harm incident while she was pregnant with triplets.   

Matt and Ashleigh Conwell, from Brisbane, had been tightly budgeting to care for their three unborn babies after they were both financially impacted by COVID-19.

But the 29-year-old's dreams of a happy family were dashed when her 'beloved soulmate' took his own life on September 2.

Following the sudden loss of Mr Conwell in after he was hit and killed by a 4WD on September 2, members of the community rallied behind Mrs Conewell to help support her

With their three babies due just before Christmas, kindhearted strangers took it upon themselves to raise much needed money for Ms Conwell.

As of Thursday morning $255,640 had been been raised by more than 3,700 donors since the GoFundMe was launched. 

Nicola Britton, GoFundMe's Australian senior regional manager, said the heartbreaking story resonated with members of the community, The Courier Mail reported. 

'The more close-knit a community, the quicker donations come in, and this one escalated very quickly due to the circumstances,' she said.

'Generosity hasn't slowed down this year, and that's really surprised me; at a time of such social and economic uncertainty, people are turning compassion into action and donating is their way to show they are there for someone.'

To help with the costs associated with being a single mum-of-three, a devastated Mrs Conwell agreed to let her friend Alex Nesevski set up a GoFundMe page.

'Ashleigh isn't the sort of person who would ask for help, and money can never replace the loss of her husband, but she knows she needs support,' Mrs Nesevski previously told Daily Mail Australia.

She explained the costs of pregnancy, delivery and caring for triplets that would be 'challenging for any couple' are especially difficult for a jobless single mother. 

'They were already stretching every dollar and budgeting tightly for the arrival of their unexpected but so very wanted family ... the financial hardship she now finds herself in is significant,' she said.  

'She has to see a specialist every two weeks because carrying three babies is a huge physical strain - growing bones and brains.'

Queensland Police confirmed it was a self-harm incident, with Senior Sergeant Tom Nelson saying it had been 'very sad'

The page has been overwhelmed with friends and family offering support for the young family, as the amount of money raised continues to surge.

'I passed the scene of the accident and I can assure you that the emergency services were doing all they could to help Matt,' one woman wrote on the fundraising page.

'I wish you the very best for the arrival of your beloved babies and for the beautiful life that you will create together with them and your families.'

Another shared: 'As someone who lost their husband before giving birth to our first child, my heart is broken for you. This will be the biggest ride of your life, but I promise you, these babies will get you through the darkest days and you will see the sun again.'

Mrs Conwell's sister Emily Fallon, 27, told the Courier-Mail that her 'very caring and genuine' brother-in-law wasn't thinking clearly when he took his own life.

'It was a snap decision, a moment of clouded judgement, and totally out of character,' she said.  

She explained that he struggled after being financially impacted by COVID-19, but 'it wasn't meant to be this way'.

'This year's been tough for everyone, even the strongest people you thought could get through it ... it just shows suicide doesn't discriminate,' she said.

Ms Fallon said the families rallied around Mrs Conwell with love and support to show that she will not raise her children alone.

A pregnant Mrs Conwell arrived at the scene and broke down and suffered 'extreme shock' following her husband's death.

Mrs Nesevski told Daily Mail Australia the mother-to-be has vowed to raise her children knowing who their father is.

'Losing Matt has placed an almost overwhelming burden on Ashleigh, and she's the strongest person I know,' she said. 

'She keeps saying "I'm going to be strong for our babies".'
