MAXCONNECTORS announced it had signed Bella on Tuesday.

Alongside a shout-out for collaborations, the agency wrote: 'Down-to-earth Bella radiates warmth, happiness and health, speaking to a life of love, fun and adventure.'

And it appears Bella is just as keen to make her 15 minutes of fame more permanent.

'So excited to see what the future holds and stoked to be represented by this beautiful team!'

While Bella currently has a modest number of followers, others represented by the agency have millions watching their every move.

MAXCONNECTORS' most popular client, YouTube beauty queen Lauren Curtis, has 1.3 million Instagram followers and more than three million YouTube subscribers.

In more promising news for Bella's career, she is rumoured to be appearing on the upcoming season of Bachelor in Paradise - after losing Locky's heart to her former best friend Irena Srbinovska.

Discussing last week's Bachelor finale on Channel 10's Cocktails and Roses podcast, franchise host Osher Günsberg said: 'Maybe it's not the last we'll see of Bella.'

'I don't know if we're going to go back at any point, but part of me really wants to say "bula Bella" under a bure - but I don't know if we're going to do Paradise in Fiji at the moment. I don't know what's going to happen,' he added.
