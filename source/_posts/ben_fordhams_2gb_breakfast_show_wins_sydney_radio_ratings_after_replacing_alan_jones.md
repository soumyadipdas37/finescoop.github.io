Ben Fordham faced widespread scrutiny after taking over Alan Jone's 2GB breakfast show in May. 

But it seems Fordham, 43, is having the last laugh, after his show won the Sydney radio ratings on Tuesday. 

Proving himself a formidable replacement for his predecessor, Fordham's breakfast show won the AM Breakfast slot with 17.3 per cent in the first survey since Jones' departure- a number almost identical to Jones' last survey results of  17.9 per cent.

Fordham was reportedly under pressure to produce good ratings after critics believed he was 'too nice and relaxed' to fill the famously fiery Jones' shoes. 

However, Fordham previously told The Australian that he wasn't trying to emulate Jones' style, but rather 'bring his own flavour of breakfast to the radio.' 

'My main focus is going to be what's on the mind of people as they wake up in Sydney, and that needs to really drive my agenda every day,' he told the publication in June.

Defending his credentials, the media personality said: 'I've been working in Sydney for the last 20-plus years, building a lot of contacts in police and politics and community life and charities and everything else I'm associated with, so hopefully I've got a pretty good grasp on what's going on.'    

Fordham previously revealed that he didn't initially want the 2GB breakfast job, and that it was actually his wife Jodie Speers who ultimately made the decision for him. 

Speaking to Stellar Magazine, Fordham said he turned down the role multiple times because he wasn't sure whether it would be the 'best for his family'.

'I totally appreciate that the job itself is a spectacular one. But make no mistake, it's not one I was chasing for family reasons. I just wasn't. 

'I was concerned about the impact it would have on the family setup. And I suppose I just thought it would be easier not to. I think I said no about six times,' he admitted. 

Fordham was ultimately swayed by the realisation that his new schedule would allow him to pick up his  son, Freddy, five, from school, and the endorsement of Jodie, 37.

He explained: 'I lean on her heavily. And I gave her a deadline and said, 'Listen, if you change your mind and say no, I will never hold it against you.''

Jodie told Stellar: 'I knew he had to take it, but I probably had a bit of a knot in my stomach trying to process it'.  

Ben recently took his older children, son Freddy, five, and daughter Pearl, three, out of school due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Ben and Jodie, who were married in 2011, welcomed their third child, a daughter, Marigold 'Goldie' Jean, in September last year.
