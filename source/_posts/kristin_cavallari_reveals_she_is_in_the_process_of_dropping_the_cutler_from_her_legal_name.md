Five months after she announced her split from her husband Jay Cutler, Kristin Cavallari revealed she's in the process of changing her legal name.

The 33-year-old fashion designer and reality star appeared in a Zoom interview for On Air With Ryan Seacrest, when Seacrest noticed something.

He realized that his guest's display name still read 'Kristin Cutler,' telling the blonde beauty that she needed to change it, but she said it's technically still her name, though she's working on it.

Name change: Five months after she announced her split from her husband Jay Cutler, Kristin Cavallari revealed she's in the process of changing her legal name

'Oh my God I didn't even notice that,' Cavallari said with a laugh, as Seacrest mentioned that, 'it's Kristin Cutler on my screen.'

'Technically, I'm still Cutler. Working on that,' Cavalarri said, while grabbing a pen and paper, adding she's, 'literally gonna take a note right now to change it.'

Seacrest added that he didn't know if she knew, 'that every time you talk it comes up,' which seemed to shock Cavallari.

Didn't notice: 'Oh my God I didn't even notice that,' Cavallari said with a laugh, as Seacrest mentioned that, 'it's Kristin Cutler on my screen'

'You're the first person who's said that! Thank you for pointing that out! I appreciate it,' Cavalarri said. 

The fashion designer was also asked about the difference between 'growing apart,' as Cavalarri said had happened with her and Cutler, and 'growing together.'

'Clearly I don’t [know],' Cavalarri joked. 'I heard one time that you never really grow together,' she added.

Difference: The fashion designer was also asked about the difference between 'growing apart,' as Cavalarri said had happened with her and Cutler, and 'growing together'

'It’s more like one person grows a little bit and then the other person catches up and then that person might grow and then that person catches up, you’re never just like along together,' she added.

'But I guess it boils down to can the other person catch up in time? I don’t know. I wish I had that answer. I probably wouldn’t be getting a divorce if I did,' she added.

While she was reticent to give out advice, one thing she did learn was to learn your partner's 'love language.' 

Grows: 'It’s more like one person grows a little bit and then the other person catches up and then that person might grow and then that person catches up, you’re never just like along together,' she added

'Not that I’m one to give advice currently, but one thing that I did think was really helpful was the five love languages,” she shared. 

'The key is obviously we all feel love a certain way, but you have to be able to speak the other person’s language otherwise it won’t resonate and I think that’s crucial,' she added.

Cavalarri and Cutler were wed in June 2013 in Nashville, and they share three children together, Camden, Jaxon, and Saylor. 

No advice: 'Not that I’m one to give advice currently, but one thing that I did think was really helpful was the five love languages,” she shared
