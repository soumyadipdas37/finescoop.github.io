A former research and development director has been arrested after making seven hoax 'swatting' calls to the police.

Vadim Pinskiy, 35, made up a number of domestic disturbances and violent incidents which never occurred, New Jersey Police say.  

Swatting, a form of retaliation where people make false reports to get police, often SWAT teams, to descend on a particular address, has become a growing problem.

Lawmakers say internet and gaming culture has increased the number of swatting calls in recent years. 

Pinskiy, originally from Uzbekistan, started the hoax calls in June using an anonymous tip-off service.

Over the following months, six more calls were made about violent disturbances at the same address, none of which turned out to be true.

Police traced the IP address making the bogus claims and tracked down Pinskiy.

They found he knew the people at the home he was regularly reporting to police but did not say how.

They arrested Pinskiy at his Promenade Boulevard home last week during a court-warranted search.

He was charged with seven counts of making false reports and harassment, as well as a count of stalking.

Ramsey police sent him to Bergen County Jail after his arrest on Wednesday but he was ordered to be released by a judge the following day.

Under new laws passed in 2015, making false reports can be punished with a prison sentenced of five to 10 years and a fine of up to $150,000. 

Under a tougher law passed in 2015, swatting in New Jersey is punishable by five to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $150,000.
