EastEnders has released its nail-biting new comeback trailer and Mick Carter's son Ollie looks to be in danger. 

The tot can be seen playing football in a new clip from the series as a mysterious woman takes pictures of him from the distance. 

Mick (Danny Dyer), who plays with his son, is completely oblivious to the unknown woman who appears to be stalking him and Ollie.

Elsewhere, Stacey Slater's (Lacey Turner) return to Walford appears to have not been well received by her ex best friend Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton) as she asks Ruby why she doesn't look happy to see her.

Viewers are already aware that Stacey's husband Martin (James Bye) has moved on with Ruby during the Covid-19 lockdown.

Meanwhile, tensions are reaching breaking point between Chantelle Atkins (Jessica Plummer) and her evil husband Gray Atkins (Toby-Alexander Smith).

In the new trailer, he is seen confronting her when she arrives home and asks: 'Where are you, I've been trying you for the last 20 minutes' as she looked terrified.
