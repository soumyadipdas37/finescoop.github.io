Arjen Robben scored his first goal for Eredivisie club Groningen since coming out of retirement earlier this year.

Robben left Bayern Munich in 2019 and entered retirement after a stellar 10-year career that saw him win the Bundesliga title and DFB-Pokal double in his final season.

However, after a change of heart the former Netherlands international decided to make a sentimental return to the club where he started his career and subsequently scored in their preseason friendly.

The 36-year-old found the net during Groningen's friendly against Arminia Bielefeld on Sunday afternoon after he pulled on the green and white shirt for the first time since April 28, 2002. 

Robben slotted the ball past Arminia's goalkeeper with a low left footed strike from outside the box within the first 16 minutes of the game.  

Robben was, however, expected to make his debut against PEC Zwolle last month but decided to continue to develop his fitness in training before making a full return.

It was the first time Robben has worn his boyhood club's match kit since April 28, 2002

He told Groningen's official site at the time: 'I want to get even fitter before I start competitions. I had a very good training week, where I was able to do things to 100per cent.

'I'm really in a good position, but playing a match is completely different to training. After not having played football for a year, it is logical that you will experience some complaints.' 

Prior to his retirement, the former Real Madrid and Chelsea winger won La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, as well as two Premier League crowns over three seasons.
