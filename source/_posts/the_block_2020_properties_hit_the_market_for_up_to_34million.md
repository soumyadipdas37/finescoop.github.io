The Block homes have officially hit the market after months of renovations and a pandemic lockdown. 

On Thursday, potential buyers and fans of the show were given a first look at the family homes after images were released on Domain. 

The pictures showed the revealed rooms in each of the properties - each built in 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940 and 1950 - located in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Brighton.

Each of the properties currently have an asking price of between $3.2million to $3.4million, which Domain reported is well above the affluent suburb's median house price of $2,617,500.
