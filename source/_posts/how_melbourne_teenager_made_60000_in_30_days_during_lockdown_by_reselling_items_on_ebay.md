Marcus Pereira, 16, made $60,000 in one month

A high school student has revealed how he made $60,000 in just one month flipping desks, ovens and toys on eBay during coronavirus lockdowns.

Marcus Pereira started selling household items online from a computer at his parents' Melbourne home in August 2019, at the age of 15.

The now-16-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that he used to make about $20,000 'in a good month' before COVID-19. 

By the time the city was locked down to curb the spread of coronavirus in April 2020, the Year 11 student was making three times that amount each month.

'People were buying stuff because they were indoors,' he said.

'They wanted desks because they were working at home, fitness equipment became really popular, and sales for games increased because kids were also stuck inside.' 

Mr Pereira sells products using the dropshipping method - a cost-free business model that allows people to sell items on behalf of suppliers, for a profit.

Mr Pereira (pictured left with his cousin Leon) realised the demand for household items started to skyrocket during the height of the pandemic and tweaked his business model

The sales model allows him to advertise and sell furniture and large appliances from department stores, such as Kmart, on his eBay account, at an inflated cost.

'If I have a table from Kmart that's worth $50, I'll put it on my eBay store for $80. 

'When it sells, I put the order in on behalf of the customer through Kmart. They take care of the shipping, and I keep the extra $30.' 

While he was used to working in an online capacity, Mr Pereira realised the demand for household items started to skyrocket during the height of the pandemic and tweaked his business model.

'I decided to buy up things like ovens, desks and some toys, hold on to them, and sell them at an inflated price.'

He kept piles of ovens and small appliances in his parents' home, which he also shares with his three siblings, and personally shipped them out to customers for an extra fee.

'That's when sales increased to about $50,000 to $60,000 per month.' 

Mr Pereira currently has 308 items in his eBay store with products valued between $29.99, for a bathroom shelf rack, and $1,500 for a VR headset.

He has sold 32 headsets so far.

The teenager is now back to dropshipping full time and says he is able to sell items at an inflated price because eBay customers are devoted to the platform.

Take action: 'If you have an idea, take action immediately.'

'I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't made a decision in the moment to execute on my idea. 

'If you have an idea, follow through with it.'

Look at free resources: 'There are so many resources to learn anything for free online. 

'You can learn about what I'm doing for free on YouTube.'

'EBay has a fantastically loyal fan base, and it's backed by the eBay guarantee.'

The online shopping platform guarantees buyers their money back if the item doesn't arrive, or is different to how it was described in the listing.

'A lot of people are sceptical about buying online and they don't trust websites, but eBay does about two billion transactions per day - I was able to capitalise on that.' 

He will have amassed a small fortune of about $100,000 by the end of the year, but says he started saving at the age of 12.

'The first time I ever made money online was though a Youtube channel where I would upload videos of myself playing games.'

He had about 7,000 subscribers and would earn up to $300 per month.  

Mr Pereira has one more year left of school and hopes to continue to move his business off eBay in the future. 

He is saving all his profits to invest once he turns 18.
