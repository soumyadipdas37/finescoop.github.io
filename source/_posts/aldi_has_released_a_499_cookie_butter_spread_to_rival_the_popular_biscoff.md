Aldi Australia has released a $4.99 cookie butter spread that rivals the popular European version Biscoff and customers are already designing desserts made out of it.

The delicious product was released as part of the store's weekly Special Buys in early September, and since then shoppers have been praising the pantry treat for being near-identical to the overseas version.  

Cookie butter is a food paste made primarily from gingerbread and caramel-tasting cookie crumbs, fat, flour, and sugar.

In Biscoff's case the ingredients are mixed until they become spreadable on a sandwich, with countries like Belgium, the Netherlands and France eating it as an alternative to nut butter and chocolate spreads

Aldi does sell the Biscoff variety for $5.50 but it is usually sold out in stores, so this has become a good alternative for those who miss out.

One woman who bought a jar of both the smooth and crunchy cookie butter spread 'on impulse' took to Facebook on September 22 looking for recipes.

'Did I buy these on impulse... Yes. Am I regretting my purchase... Heck no! Will I go back and buy some more... Yes! Recipes anyone? At the moment the only recipe I have is a spoon,' she said.

'Melt it over ice cream. It will set slightly hard on the top of it,' one person said.

'Put it in a cheesecake. I can't think of anything more delicious... and that's what I do with Biscoff,' said another. 

A third added: 'I slice up apple and dip it in this. Delicious. Over the top of pancakes is awesome too'.

1. Whip 600ml whipping cream with two tablespoons of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla essence, to soft peaks.

2. Place one layer of spice cookies in a dish, spread over half of the cream mixture.

3. Melt your cookie spread in the microwave until soft and runny, and drizzle about 1/2 cup over cream mixture.

4. Place another layer of spice cookies on top of cookie spread, and spread the rest of the cream mixture on top of the cookies.

5. Drizzle more cookie spread on top of cream and use a knife or skewer to swirl a pattern.

6. Refrigerate for a couple of hours, preferably over night. It is very sweet, I add berries in the middle layer too.

A few people said they have become 'addicted' to the spread in recent weeks and cautioned against buying too many jars at once.

'Don't buy these from ALDI! WARNING!!! Don't know what spell is on them but you will crave this and you will have to wait a year before you can buy them again. Happened to me twice,' one woman said.

'I'm not buying any more!! I bought two jars and ate all of them by myself like Miss Piggy!! Then read how many calories and nearly had a fit,' said another.
