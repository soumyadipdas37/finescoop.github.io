They were pregnant at the same time together seven years ago, and are now reminiscing on the joys – and terrors – of motherhood.

As a guest on the new Drew Barrymore Show, actress Reese Witherspoon allowed that she was 'terrified' of becoming a mother at a young age back in 1999.

Witherspoon, 44, chatted with Barrymore, 45, on the program's second day, as host Drew praised the Walk The Line actress about her ability to handle both a burgeoning film career and two young children at home.

'How did you balance work and motherhood at that point?' Drew, who is mom to daughters Olive, seven, and Frankie, six, with ex-husband Will Kopelman, asked. 'Because I was just trying to balance work!' 

Witherspoon, who shares daughter Ava, 21, and son Deacon, 16, with ex Ryan Phillippe, told Drew: 'I got pregnant when I was 22 years old. And I didn't know how to balance work and motherhood. You just do it, you know?'

At the time, Reese was somewhat of an indie darling, having cut her teeth on successful fare such as Election in 1999 along with Cruel Intentions in the same year.

Reese told Drew: 'I got pregnant when I was 22 years old. And I didn't know how to balance work and motherhood. You just do it, you know?'

Of that time, Witherspoon recalled: 'I'd made movies but I hadn't, you know, established myself as someone who could demand that it shoot close to my kids' school or, you know, I didn't have any real power, leverage within my industry.  

'I was just like every other mom trying to figure it out—and dad out there, and partner, and grandparent who's raising a child,' she continued.

It wasn't until 2001's Legally Blonde when she hit it big, followed of course by her Best Actress Oscar win for 2005's Walk The Line opposite Joaquin Phoenix.

Since then, Reese has gone on to demand 'real power [and] leverage' within her industry, with successful projects like Wild, Big Little Lies, The Morning Show and Little Fires Everywhere. 

The actress also had a third child in 2012, Tennessee James, with her talent agent husband Jim Toth.

During their chat, Drew fondly remembered welcoming Reese to her wedding in 2012, when they were both pregnant – Drew with her first child Olive.

'We were bumping bellies, the only two sober chicks there,' Drew happily remembered.

And of the sacrifices of being a mom, Witherspoon only had amazing things to say. 

'You take the food out of your mouth, the clothes off your back, the sleep out of your life,' she told her friend Barrymore. 

'But every bit of it—every bit of that sacrifice is truly worth it because you feel like, that's what makes me wake up on a Sunday. It's not movies or my job, it's my kids.'
