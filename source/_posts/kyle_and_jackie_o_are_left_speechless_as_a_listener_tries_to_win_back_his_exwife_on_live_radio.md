KIIS FM's Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson may have the gift of the gab. 

But the shock-jocks were left completely speechless on Thursday's radio show after a listener tried to win his ex-wife back on live radio. 

During what was supposed to be a heartwarming segment, Kyle and Jackie attempted to help a man named Ahmed convince his ex Sally to give him a second chance. 

When live radio goes terribly wrong: KIIS FM's Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson (pictured) were left speechless on Thursday after a listener named Ahmed tried to win back his ex-wife Sally 

Ahmed revealed Sally had dumped him last year because he'd failed to show her enough affection during their three-year marriage. 

'She felt like I never loved her that much,' he said, adding: 'Whatever happens after today, it's just a closure for me. I've got a lot of guilt inside of me and I just want to make her understand I am guilty.' 

Unfortunately, Ahmed's dreams turned into a nightmare when Sally brutally rejected him on live radio.    

'Why would I get back together with a manipulative, lying [expletive]?' While Ahmed was confident he would be able to woo his former flame, Sally made it abundantly clear she wasn't interested 

'I'm so sorry but I'm not with you... actually I'm not sorry,' Sally snapped. 

'You're not sorry at all?' replied Ahmed.

'No, I'm not. Why would I get back together with a manipulative, lying [expletive]? Did you really think you'd get me back through this?' she raged. 

'Figure out your sexuality first, then let me know whether you're straight or gay': The confrontation devolved further when Sally questioned Ahmed's sexuality

The confrontation devolved further when Sally questioned Ahmed's sexuality. 

'Figure out your sexuality first, then let me know whether you're straight or gay,' she fumed.

Jackie was lost for words, while Kyle managed to awkwardly mutter: 'Oh oh...'

Sally proceeded to take yet another stab at Ahmed, declaring that she would 'rather be single for the rest of her life' than get back with such a 'toxic' person. 

Making it clear her answer to Ahmed's romantic proposal was a resounding 'no', Sally added: 'He's a very toxic person. I spent three and a half years of my marriage living with him and I won't do that to myself again.; 

Speechless: Jackie was lost for words, while Kyle managed to awkwardly mutter: 'Oh oh...'
