Sylvia Jeffreys, 34, and Jayne Azzopardi, 35, have enjoyed a very coordinated play date with their seven-month-old sons.  

Posting to Instagram on Friday, Jayne, shared a series of snaps of the mother-son play date. 

She explained that the Channel Nine presenters had accidentally 'couple dressed' with their respective sons.

'When you show up for a coffee/play date and realise you’ve both couple-dressed,' she captioned the picture. 

In one photo Sylvia and her son Oscar, were matchy-matchy in an all grey ensemble, while Jayne and Joey both went nautical in blue and white stripes. 

Both mum's flaunted their natural beauty with minimal makeup as they posed with their bubs.

In a second photo, Oscar and Joey appeared to be the best of mates as they were pictured laughing together in high chairs.  

This comes after Sylvia shared a sweet photo to Instagram of the six-month-old dipping his toes into the ocean for the first time on Monday.

In the hilarious picture, which was taken at Sydney's Bronte Beach, the child screwed up his nose and did not appear to be enjoying the milestone.

Not happy, mum! Sylvia has shared a photo of her son, Oscar, dipping his toes into the ocean for the first time at Bronte Beach. Oscar is pictured with his father, Peter Stefanovic

 'It was all fun and games until his toes touched the water,' Sylvia captioned the snap.

'Definitely a Queenslander,' she added, referencing the fact that both she and her husband, Peter Stefanovic, were born and raised in the Sunshine State.

In the image, Peter, 38, held on to Oscar reassuringly as he took his first dip in the ocean.

Much better: Peter later shared an image of Oscar looking much happier back on the sand as he cuddled up with his mother (Sylvia and Oscar pictured)
