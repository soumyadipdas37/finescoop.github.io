Three modelling legends graced the Fendi runway at Milan Fashion Week today. 

British beauties Yasmin Le Bon, 55, and Karen Elson, 41, were joined by Czech star Eva Herzigová, 47, at the fashion house's Spring/Summer 2021 collection during the third day of the couture event.

Czech modelling legend Eva Herzigová, 47, looked sleek in a black jacket and matching skirt with a slit 

Elson, who's made a name for herself as a singer on top of her modelling career, looked regal in a light grey trench coat.  

Plus size model Ashley Graham was also among the models walking for the brand. 

The set of the runway of the luxury brand was airy, allowing the models to walk at a safe distance from the fashionistas sat on comfortable wife sofas and donning masks. 

Yasmin Le Bon, who was one of the highest paid models of the 1980s, looked beautiful in a form-fitting leather trench coat in shades of brown which complimented her porcelain complexion. 

Eva Herzigová strutted confidently on the runway, holding a red clutch bag which brought a pop of colour to her black outfit 

As a fashion choice, some models wore only one drop earring on their right ear while walking for Fendi

The Fendi runway offered an intimate setting while leaving plenty of space between the masked attendees and the models 

Yasmin's hair was tucked in a neat bun while the natural makeup highlighted her beautiful complexion 

Carrying a matching handbag, she glided down the runway in a pair of Fendi heels in cream. 

Her hair was neatly tucked into a bun, which revealed one statement drop earring on her right hear. 

The single earring looks was due to an artistic choice from Fendi, as Czech supermodel Eva Herzigová also sported the one single piece of jewellery with her outfit.

Her blond locks were also tucked in a sleek bun, and her nude makeup complimented her natural beauty.

Her fiery red bangs bounced as she took step after step on the runway, in a pair of black heels.
