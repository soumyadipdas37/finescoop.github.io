Disgraced former Congressman and convicted sex offender Anthony Weiner appears to be picking up the pieces of his shattered life after landing a new job as the head of a company that makes countertops out of broken glass.

The 56-year-old Democrat, who spent 18 months in a New York prison for sexting a 15-year-old girl, was recently unveiled as the CEO of Brooklyn-based IceStone having been officially appointed in May, according to a NY Post report.

Weiner announced his new line of work in a promotional email showcasing IceStone’s products, one of which contained flecks of orange and blue glass.

‘One of the amazing things about IceStone countertops, is that since people throw away all kinds of glass, there is almost an unlimited array of different colors we can use in our recycled glass creations,’ he wrote, according to the outlet.

‘So that when I joined the company as CEO I asked what I thought was an obvious question — Can we make a countertop in the colors of my favorite New York teams?

‘So while not everyone is a fan of the Islanders (fingers crossed), Mets (ugh) or Knicks (don’t ask), if you are interested in a little color in your life, give IceStone a call,’ he added.

The move was also made official on his LinkedIn page, having been officially appointed to the role in May

According to its website, IceStone champions itself as an employer committed to giving ‘second chances’ beyond its factory and products.

The company says it hires the homeless, refugees and even helps to train the formerly incarcerated, while ensuring ‘everyone gets paid a living wage and has access to subsidized health insurance and a voice in the company.’

Weiner stepped down from his seat in New York's 9th congressional district in 2011, after the then-married Democrat accidentally tweeted a crotch-shot of himself in his underwear to the public, on his official page.

IceStone owner Del LaManga (above) told the Post he has known Weiner for a long time, having met him a number of years ago after an launching his own unsuccessful Congressional bid. He said he also visited Weiner a number of times while he was in prison.

He attempted to revive his political career two years later in a 2013 run for New York mayor. He surged to first place in the polls before his campaign suffered a spectacular blow when a second sexting scandal surfaced.

Weiner, still married to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin at the time, was found to be exchanging lewd messages online under the alias ‘Carlos Danger’.

But the successive scandals were eclipsed four years later in 2017, when Weiner admitted to sexting with a 15-year-old girl, following a DailyMail.com investigation.

For months, Weiner and the minor exchanged sexually graphic text messages, spoke over several social media platforms and he sent her photographs of himself in various states of undress, sometimes posing with his son.

After DailyMail.com exposed Weiner, he admitted to knowing that the victim, from North Carolina, was underage at the time of their exchanges.

Weiner was arrested by FBI agents in May that year. He admitted one count of transmission of obscene material later that month, weeping in court as he entered his guilty plea.

'I have a sickness but I do not have an excuse,' he said, after the judge told him that he would have to register as a sex offender.

He was then sentenced to 21 months in prison that September, but was let out three months early on good behavior.

IceStone owner Del LaManga told the Post he has known Weiner for a long time, having met him a number of years ago after an launching his own unsuccessful Congressional bid. He said he also visited Weiner a number of times while he was in prison.

‘I knew him from the political world. He talked me out of running for mayor, which was good, and we developed a relationship,’ he said.

‘And then he got sucked into that whole thing. I wanted to help him any way I could. He served his time and coming out is tough. And so I said, ‘Can you work for Ice Stone?’ because he knows everybody in the city and the company is in Brooklyn.’

The 74-year-old said the company has ‘never been successful’ and he hired Weiner around five months ago in an effort to turn its fortunes around.

LaManga, who made his fortune as the founder of the Tweezerman brand of beauty tools, was originally an investor in the company but later took control and when the owner ran into financial difficulties.

Earlier this year he decided to ‘replace himself’. Citing Weiner’s experience from Congress, he said there was no better man for the job.

And LaManga’s faith has reportedly been repaid, as he says ‘Anthony is a better CEO than I was.’

‘He’s just methodically going through and reinventing every aspect. The first thing he did was rebuild the website so it works better…He took over supervising the factory, so he shows up there and he’s a fanatically organized person, and he’s cleaned all that up.’

LaManga declined to disclose to the post what salary Weiner is on. He did however voice confidence that he’s ‘completely moved on’ from his troubled past.

‘He’s doing extremely well … He’s very bright. I like him, my wife likes him.’
