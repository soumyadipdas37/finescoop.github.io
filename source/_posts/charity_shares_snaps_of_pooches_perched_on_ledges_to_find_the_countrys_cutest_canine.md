One thing all dog owners know is when they return home from a trip out, their pooch will be excitedly waiting for them.

And often a dog will be perched on a window ledge, ready to say hello as soon as they get home.

According to a new study from Safestyle, owners made more of a conscious effort to spend time with their pooches and pets during lockdown. 

To celebrate, the double glazing company is running a nationwide #DoginWindow photo competition asking owners to share their best snaps to find the UK's cutest pooch. 

After receiving hundreds of brilliant submissions from proud owners all over the UK, it has shared some of its favourite entries, with FEMAIL.
