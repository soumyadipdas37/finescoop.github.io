She's one of three daughters that Demi Moore shares with ex-husband Bruce Willis.

And on Monday, Scout Willis was spotted running some errands in LA with her beloved rescue pup Grandma.

The 28-year-old went low-key casual in a loose-fitting black long-sleeve top and black tailored pants.

Scout left her long hair loose and styled with a center parting, and she wore a disposable face mask as required under COVOD-19 regulations in California.

At one point, she carried her pup in a large beige sling and then dumped it to carry the Chihuahua mix in one hand as she walked.

In late August, Scout posted a sweet snap of her beloved pup Grandma to her Instagram and alongside it, she gushed about what the dog means to her.

'This dog...I cannot even begin to put words together to accurately describe my devotion to this magical, mystical creature that I have the sacred privilege of caring for,' she wrote.

'I consider Grandma one of my closest friends and despite the fact that I when I found her I wasn’t even interested in having a dog, she is the absolute dog love of my life! GRANDMAAAAAAAA I just love her so much.'
