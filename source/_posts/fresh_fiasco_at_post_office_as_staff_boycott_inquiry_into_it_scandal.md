The public inquiry into the Post Office IT scandal was plunged into chaos yesterday as postmasters refused to cooperate.

Up to 2,500 former Post Office staff were wrongly sacked, forced to repay cash or wrongfully convicted – and some even jailed – after bosses pursued them for money 'missing' from branch accounts.

It later emerged that the shortfalls were likely to be the result of flaws in the Horizon computer system.

Yesterday ministers launched a 'review', led by former High Court judge Sir Wyn Williams, to find out what happened.

But MPs and campaigners labelled it a 'whitewash' and a 'betrayal', and called for a full inquiry. 

Alan Bates, founder of the Justice For Sub-Postmasters Alliance, said: 'This is a pointless exercise, it's utterly futile, another whitewash. We certainly will not engage in this inquiry.

'It's just an internal review, it's got nothing to do with redressing what they've done in the past.'

A cross-party group of more than 50 MPs has called for a full inquiry into the 'biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history'. 

They said Sir Wyn will not be able to compel witnesses to attend or be cross-examined. 

He will also not investigate what the role of the Government, which owns the Post Office, was in the scandal.

Yesterday Labour MP Karl Turner, a barrister and former shadow attorney general, said: 'Ministers have yet again utterly betrayed postmasters who have already suffered so much.'

The Post Office paid a £58million settlement to postmasters last year after a High Court battle.

The Court of Appeal is preparing to overturn 47 convictions for theft, false accounting and fraud, while the Post Office has instructed lawyers to examine a further 900 convictions.

Yesterday Tory peer Lord Arbuthnot, a long-time campaigner for postmasters, said: 'This 'review' will not get to the bottom of the scandal as the Prime Minister said he wanted to do. It is a total failure to address the key issues about the terms of reference.

'The Post Office is Government owned, directed and funded - and still the terms of reference pretend the Post Office has got nothing to do with the Government.

'Ministers simply must face up to their own and the Government's responsibility for giving those postmasters who have suffered so dreadfully the compensation they deserve and to get to the bottom of what happened.' 

They said Sir Wyn, who was appointed to the High Court in 2007, will not be able to compel witnesses to attend or be cross-examined.

He will also not investigate what the role of the Government, which owns the Post Office, was in the scandal and postmasters.

The scandal is being investigated by the MPs' Business Committee, which took evidence from embattled former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells in June.
