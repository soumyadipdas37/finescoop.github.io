Jurgen Klopp has admitted he is itching to finally meet and speak with Marcelo Bielsa ahead of Liverpool's season opener on Saturday, though joked that language may be an issue.

The German manager will come up against last season's winner of the Championship, and wishes to compare notes with Bielsa providing his limited Spanish skills allow him to do so.

Speaking to Football Daily, Klopp made light of the situation and explained that his Spanish went as far as ordering a beer on holiday, before waxing lyrical about Bielsa's style and ideas.

The enigmatic Argentine will bring a unique and meticulous brand of football to the top flight

'My Spanish is pretty random, I'd love to have a conversation with him which would be nice, but I don't speak Spanish apart from ordering a beer and I don't know how his English is meanwhile,' said the Liverpool boss.

'So that's a bit of a shame but apart from that I just couldn't have more respect for what he is doing to be honest.

Bielsa has breathed life into Leeds, and has influenced the likes of Pep Guardiola in his career

'What a guy. The team, the style, how they play will suit them even more for the Premier League than for the Championship one hundred percent. 

'They can be and will be very very uncomfortable to play against.' 

Both teams face off in Saturday's late kick-off, with the action commencing in an empty Anfield at 5.30pm.

It has been 17 years since the two teams last faced in a Premier League clash on Merseyside, in a clash which saw Liverpool triumph 3-1.

Michael Owen and Danny Murphy were among the goals for the hosts, before local Leeds hero Alan Smith grabbed one back for his side.

Florent Sinama Pongolle scored a late tap-in winner, to give three points to his side and add further misery to a crumbling season for Leeds, which ultimately resulted in relegation.
