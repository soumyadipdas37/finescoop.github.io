Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has left Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal out of his squad for their pre-season friendly against Nastic.

Koeman has disregarded the two stars with no explanation after choosing to rest Pjanic, Todibo, Ansu Fati, and Ter Stegen due to coronavirus recovery and injuries.

The decision to leave out Suarez and Vidal could suggest that the pair played their final game in a Barcelona shirt against Bayern Munich in Lisbon.

Suarez has been heavily linked with a move to Juventus after being left out of Koeman plans. 

Having held talks with the Catalans to terminate his contract, which expires in 2021, after six successful years at the Camp Nou, Suarez has been forced to train on his own. 

As it stands, Suarez has reportedly agreed a £9million salary with the Serie A champions in a move that would see him link-up with Cristiano Ronaldo in Turin.

While, Inter Milan are leading the race to sign Vidal with Antonio Conte rating the midfielder

Neto, Iñaki Peña, Arnau Tenas, Nelson Semedo, Piqué, Sergio Busquets, Griezmann, Messi, Dembélé, Lenglet, Jordi Alba, Braithwaite, Sergi Roberto, Frenkie de Jong, Junior, Coutinho, Aleñá, Trincao, Pedri, Riqui Puig, Araujo, Cuenca, Miranda, Konrad and Ilaix Moriba.

While, Inter Milan are leading the race to sign Vidal, with Antonio Conte rating the Chile international highly.

The 33-year-old has been vocal in his criticism of Barcelona, criticising the club for being too reliant on Lionel Messi and having too many youth products in the first-team. He slammed the club fro having just '13 professional players'. 

Vidal made 43 appearances last season, scoring eight goals, but will leave the Catalan giants as Koeman look's to overhaul their squad. 

Speaking of the friendly against Nastic, Koeman said: ‘Each player will play 45 minutes to find the intensity of the game, we are going to play two teams.

‘We will look for the intensity of the game, how we want to play with the ball, the transition of the game, how we are going pressure our rivals, things to improve.’
