Cody Simpson and Miley Cyrus confirmed their split in August after ten months of dating.

And on Wednesday, the Australian singer appeared downcast during a recent outing in Venice. 

The 23-year-old soaked up the Californian sun as he grabbed some food and coffee with pals at the Bullet Proof Cafe.  

Why so glum? On Wednesday, Cody Simpson (pictured) looked downcast during a coffee catch up with pals in Venice, California 

Cody went topless for the outing, flaunting his incredibly buff biceps and toned torso.  

He wore a pair of navy Nike exercise shorts and completed the look with a pair of black socks and camouflage patterned sneakers.  

The pals were sipping on coffee and Santa Vittoria mineral water as a remarkable glum Cody slumped down in his chair during the catch up.

In August, Miley confirmed her split from Cody after less than a year of dating in an Instagram video, telling fans the pair are taking time apart to 'work on' themselves.

Referencing her split from ex-husband Liam Hemsworth in August 2019, Miley began: 'A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me, and control my narrative, and I'm just not accepting that.

'So today, it came out that me and my boyfriend have broken up,' she added.

She continued: 'It was confirmed by a "reliable source" even though no one is reliable in a relationship except the individuals who are participating in it.'

'We are just deciding who we wanna be in our lives, what we wanna do, and so, don't make it some drama story if next week we're hanging out, getting pizza,' she added.

The American singer went on to say she remains friends with Cody, who she's known for a decade.

'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not,' she explained.

The couple began dating in September 2019, shortly after Miley had ended her fling with U.S. reality star Kaitlynn Carter.
