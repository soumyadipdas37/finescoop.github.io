Chelsea are reportedly close to agreeing a fee with Rennes for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy as Frank Lampard continues to strengthen his first-team squad this summer. 

The Blues have been heavily linked with a move for the 28-year-old, with a transfer being driven by ex-Chelsea keeper and technical and performance advisor Petr Cech. 

In addition, Lampard is not keen on stopping his £200m summer spending spree there, with Lille defensive midfielder Boubakary Soumare an option if a move for West Ham's Declan Rice does not materialise, according to The Athletic.

The report details that the Chelsea manager is still looking to strengthen in the defensive midfield area ahead of the transfer window closing on October 5. 

Meanwhile, a move for highly-rated keeper Mendy - with a £14m bid already rejected according to reports - would call into question the future of current No 1 Kepa Arrizabalaga.  

The Spaniard was dropped for the final three games of last season after some inconsistent performances.

Willy Caballero was preferred for the final Premier League game of the season against Wolves, the FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal and the Champions League last-16 second-leg loss to Bayern Munich.  

A £71million signing from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, Kepa has endured a tough two seasons in English football, with his first overshadowed by an on-pitch row with then-manager Maurizio Sarri during the 2019 Carabao Cup final at Wembley. 

That being said, Kepa did win the Europa League under Sarri and has played 69 of 76 Premier League games in the past two years.

Chelsea technical and performance advisor Petr Cech insists 'nobody is giving up on Kepa'

Cech told reporters in his native Czech republic last week: 'Additions will be made to the squad, perhaps even in goal, and this is what is being discussed now. 

'But nobody is giving up on Kepa and we all hope he has a great future.' 

Chelsea have also reportedly pondered moves for Atletico Madrid shot-stopper Jan Oblak and Burnley's Nick Pope.
