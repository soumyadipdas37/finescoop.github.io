Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez were spotted out in their native New York City on Wednesday as they face long odds in their bid for ownership of the the New York Mets baseball franchise.

The 51-year-old beauty wore a light matching ensemble of a hooded sweatshirt and pants with white Nike trainers as she kept safe with a yellow face mask. 

The Hustlers star had her brown locks up in a bun and wore sunglasses while toting a black purse on the outing with her fiancé.

The three-time baseball MVP, 45, donned a navy blue polo shirt with black pants and black shoes, covering his face with a black mask and sunglasses as he made his way out amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The celeb supercouple have been busy heading a consortium focused on purchasing the Mets from the the Wilpon and Katz families, as Newsday reported Wednesday that billionaire Steve Cohen looks to be the frontrunner to acquire the storied baseball franchise.

Sources told the newspaper that Cohen's drive to buy the team is going 'smoothly' and with 'no obstacles.'

An insider told the outlet that the transaction should become later this month, at which time Cohen would need to be voted in by 23 of 29 fellow owners.

The developments come days after Lopez and Rodriguez's side said she would be in control of the franchise - making her baseball's first female Latina owner, and that they would pay $100 million to charity if the team didn't win the World Series in 10 years or less.

'It ain’t over until it is over,' Lopez told the New York Post on Tuesday, quoting late baseball icon Yogi Berra. 

She continued, 'We are New Yorkers and we are not going to give up. We feel we have the best bid for the sport, the team and the city.'

'I would be the control person,' the Love Don’t Cost a Thing artist said of the planned arrangement with the former MLB shortstop if they were to buy the baseball club from the Wilpons/Katz group that's currently in control.

The multitalented entertainer and Rodriguez, an alum of the New York Yankees, Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners, told the publication that their bid was comparable to Cohen's $2.35 billion bid. 

Rodriguez and Lopez previously said via social media that they had 'informed the Mets that they are no longer pursuing the acquisition of the team,' but took down the posts later on. Cohen's initial move to buy the team came earlier this year, but complications have delayed the sale of the team. 

Lopez opened up last month about their efforts to try and buy the storied baseball franchise
