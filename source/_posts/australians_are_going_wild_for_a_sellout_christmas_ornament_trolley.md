Australians are preparing for Christmas by purchasing a hugely popular 'ornament trolley' that promises to keep your adornments safe during the Yuletide season and beyond.  

The largest retailer of artificial Christmas trees Down Under, Balsam Hill, are selling a 96-piece and 120-piece Deluxe Rolling Ornament Chest for $449 and $469 respectively - and the former is already sold out.

'This rolling storage box is specially designed to make decorating quick and easy, and help preserve the lustre of your ornaments for years to come,' the website read.

Parents in the Christmas Mums and Dads Facebook group have been raving about the specialised trolley, saying they are are 'absolutely loving' how organised it helps them be.

'It is well worth the investment if you're as keen on Christmas as we are. So easy to pack everything away for the following year,' one person said.

'This is so much better than the cheaper alternatives out there,' said another.

A third added: 'I want one of these so badly! They had something similar at Costco last year and I totally wanted to get one but couldn't afford it'.

Some said they only wish it came with more storage options because they had hundreds of tiny baubles to stow away

'Not practical for me. It doesn't hold enough, costs too much and is way too big,' one person said.

'I'd need more storage for my storage! I'm looking at the gaps between the layers on this thinking it's such waisted space,' said another.

The company also offers storage containers for your artificial Christmas tree, which are on sale for $299 at the moment.

All orders qualify for free shipping Australia-wide because of the price and arrive within eight working days.
