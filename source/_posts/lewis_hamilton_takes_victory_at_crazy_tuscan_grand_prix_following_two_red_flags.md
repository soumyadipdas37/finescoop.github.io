Lewis Hamilton won a chaotic, dangerous, heart-pounding Tuscan Grand Prix after red flags twice halted the drama in Mugello.

The victory takes the Briton to within one race victory of Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 – a landmark he could equal in Sochi, Russia, a week next Sunday.

The most dramatic scenes came during the first re-start, just after the safety car pulled in having been deployed for a smash on the second corner of the race. Valtteri Bottas, the then leader, waited until the last permitted moment to put his foot down. But behind him, some of the pack were overeager and effectively restarted the race before those in front had done so.







As a number of the overzealous got on and off the throttle in a few frantic seconds, madness ensued. Williams’ Nicholas Latifi sped up and slowed down, Alfa Romeo’s Antonio Giovinazzi went into the back of him. Carlos Sainz then careered into Giovinazzi, lifting him into the air. Haas driver Kevin Magnussen was also caught up in the accident. All four were sent into the barriers. A cloud of smoke hid the scene.

Sainz hurt his hand. But all four amazingly walked away.

Romain Grosjean, watching the dodgems from the cockpit of his Haas, was furious, aiming his disapproval at Bottas. ‘That was f****** stupid from whoever was at the front,’ said the Frenchman. ‘They want to kill us or what? This is the worst I have seen ever.’

Before that, Bottas had taken the lead from pole-sitter Hamilton, who made a terrible start.

The safety car almost immediately came out, after just two corners, when Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly, last week’s surprise winner at the Italian Grand Prix, ended up in the gravel.



Verstappen had engine problems anyway and would have retired even if he hadn’t crashed. He has now endured two DNFs in successive weeks – a massive dent in his title dreams. No wonder the Dutchman chucked his steering wheel on to the ground as he climbed out.

Following the second and bigger crash, on the start-finish straight, the race got underway again following a 36-minute delay. Hamilton breezed cleanly away from the grid, slotting in behind Bottas and using the slipstream to make his move decisively at the first corner.

Not great by Bottas, but that tow is hard to resist.

Hamilton took the lead and it was plain sailing until Lance Stroll’s Racing Point suffered a suspected puncture on the fast second Arrabbiata corner and smashed hard into the barriers.

The red flag was waved again with 44 of the 59 laps done.

Stroll walked along the pits to his garage, his car catching fire, while everyone else geared up for the third act of the play, this time after a 23-minute hiatus.

Bottas’s start was hopeless. Hamilton held on to his lead easily, finishing nearly five seconds ahead of Bottas with Red Bull’s Alex Albon third – the London-born Thai’s first podium. Hamilton’s championship lead stands at 54 points with nine of 17 rounds complete.

This was meant to be a celebration of Ferrari’s 1,000th race but it was far from that. Charles Leclerc finished eighth and Sebastian Vettel 10th out of 12 – their lack of pace almost painful to behold.

Brit Lando Norris finished sixth for McLaren and his countryman George Russell finished 11th for Williams.

 

Host commentator

1. Hamilton, 2. Bottas, 3. Albon, 4. Ricciardo, 5. Perez, 6. Norris, 7. Kvyat, 8. Leclerc, 9. Raikkonen, 10. Vettel.

LAP 58/59: Well he was cruising, he has just set the fastest lap... For all his luck he has had today, he has deserved this victory. No one has been able to live with his pace - certainly his team-mate among those in equal machinery.

LAP 57/59: Hamilton is also cruising to victory now, the gap hovering under two seconds.

LAP 56/59: Albon looks to have third secured under lock and key now. This will be a well overdue podium for him.

LAP 55/59: And the gap is reducing. Russell could still catch Vettel though... it's not over yet.

LAP 54/59: Russell's points charge is not all over just yet. He is now lapping faster than Raikkonen who with that five-second penalty is only just over five seconds in front.

Russell meanwhile is homing in on Vettel. 

I haven't seen a Williams go on pursuit of a Ferrari like this since Jacques Villenueve against Micahel Schumacher at Jerez '97.

LAP 54/59: Battle for P10Can @GeorgeRussell63 get past Sebastian Vettel and claim his first-ever point in F1? #TuscanGP 🇮🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/vpTLekrPOG

LAP 53/59: This race may still have some life in it. Albon is now catching Bootas...

...well he was. Bottas it turns out was preparing a charge for the fastest lap which he takes.

LAP 52/59: Russell is up to 11th having passed Grosjean on the main straight but it is Vettel holding the final points place, so you suspect that is where his points charge ends - even factoring in Raikkonen;s penalty who is over five seconds down the road.

LAP 51/59: Heartbreak for Ricciardo who loses out to Albon at turn one in the battle for the podium. The Red Bull driver is now on course for his first top three finish in Formula One.

LAP 50/59: Leclerc meanwhile moves up to ninth as Ferrari, with Vettel behind him for tenth.

LAP 49/59: Ricciardo's podium isn't secure though. Alex Albon is on his case in the battle for the final podium spot.

LAP 48/59: Disaster for Russell though in the Williams. He has dropped out of the points to last. Cruel sport, this.

LAP 47/59: Such is the Mercedes' advantage over everyone else though, Bottas soon repasses Ricciardo for second, who knows his fight lies elsewhere. Albon is up to fourth in front of Perez.

LAP 46/59: It's Hamilton into turn one.... followed by Ricciardo! A poor start from Bottas who drops to third. The FInn has blown his big chance.

Raikkonen is given a five-second time penalty after illegally entering the pit-lane before the red flag.

'Let's finish what we started' Ricciardo tells his team as he desperately hopes to retain his third spot he was looking good to secure before Stroll's accident.

In front of him, Hamilton vs Bottas. First into turn one wins?

Remember our first red flag this afternoon following that massive pile up on the straight? Well some news on that, Kevin Magnussen has been summoned to the stewards regarding 'no erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or impede the restart.'

The restart will be 12 minutes past the hour, and with just around 14 laps to go this is effectively a sprint race.

As you can see, Stroll's crash was a big one. His car was on fire five minutes after his accident, although that has since been put out.

Another supposed winner is Leclerc, who having not pitted under the brief safety car is now up to eighth place. Here is how the top 10 stand:

1. Hamilton, 2, Bottas, 3. Ricciardo, 4. Albon, 5. Perez, 6. Norris, 7. Kvyat, 8. Leclerc, 9. Russell, 10. Vettel, 11. Raikkonen, 12. Grosjean.

The race will restart, and what a crucial one it will be now. Can Bottas make the most of a Hamilton slipstream to regain the lead he initially took on the opening lap... which seems like ages ago now.

LAP 44/59 Stroll crashes at Turn 9 😮#TuscanGP 🇮🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/dHFWM2KdTH

Stroll claims he had a puncture causing his spin, but the race has been stopped. I suspect it is because a tyre barrier needs some substantial work to be fixed for safety reasons.

LAP 45/59: Both Mercedes pit and retain their 1-2 standing.

LAP 44/59: Stroll is out! He has gone straight off half-way round the track, spinning off after running on the kerbs. An odd crash but thankfully he is ok.

LAP 43/59: And now Leclerc is catching Vettel...

LAP 42/59: Russel meanwhile is still over four seconds clear of Vettel and running ninth. That Williams of the Brit is finally going to get points it seems.

LAP 41/59: Stay off the kerbs Mercedes tell their drivers. Cue pictures cutting to Bottas doing anything but as he tries to catch Hamilton. The gap is still over five seconds though,

LAP 40/59: The man on charge is Albon, having set the fastest lap and he has podium abitions as he begins to home in on Stroll who is running fourth place behind Ricciardo.

LAP 39/59: Drama at Mercedes? Perhaps not with the 15 second advantage they have over the rest of the field.

Hamilton is told to stay off all the kerbs to prevent overheating issues.

LAP 38/59: Leclerc makes his final stop of the afternoon and that drops him back to 11th behind team-mate Vettel.

Ferrari at their 1,000th race scrapping for a couple of points. Where has it all gone wrong for them?

LAP 37/59: Hamilton have been lucky to get a second bite of the cherry in the restart to pass Bottas but I do suspect he would have passed the Finn at some point this afternoon. 

Bottas has never looked comfortable, while Hamilton doesn't even look like he is full throttle at times. He has much more pace to unleash I am sure.

LAP 36/50: So Ricciardo is now running third and he is on course for his first podium since winning the 2018 Monaco Grand Prix. Stroll though is only just over a second behind him.

LAP 35/59: Meanwhile the sister Ferrari of Vettel is still not in the points, and continues to try and hunt down Russell in the Williams. Bottas sets the fastest lap but he is over six seconds behind Hamilton still...

LAP 34/59: Leclerc's afternoon continues to only go backwards, he now loses out to Norris's McLaren for seventh place.

LAP 33/59: So much for split strategies. Hamilton then pits... and also sticks on the hard tyre. No split-strategy for the Finn.

LAP 32/59 Hamilton follows his team mate into the pits the following lap, and returns to the track in the lead#TuscanGP 🇮🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/4yXWEEhIqO

LAP 32/59: Bottas pits - now seven seconds behind - pits for hard tyres.

LAP 31/59: The undercut has worked for Ricciardo who has got past Stroll following the latter's stop. That's for fourth but it effectively means he is in a net third.

LAP 30/59: Not that Bottas can do much at this stage anyway. He is now over five seconds behind his world champion team-mate.

LAP 29/59: Bottas is feeling competitive. At least in a mental sense. He has told his team to take the opposite tyre strategy to what Hamilton does when they eventually pit.

LAP 28/59: The gap between Mercedes and the rest is now 15 seconds. It's afternoons like these when you regret seeing Max Verstappen out the race early.

LAP 27/59: Renault force the issue in the battle for the podium, pitting Ricciardo. Going for the undercut over Stroll?

LAP 26/59: I haven't seen this since about the early 2000s but a Williams is faster than the Ferrari, with Russell now lapping quicker than Vettel in the battle for ninth.

LAP 25/59: Hamilton on his medium tyres is slightly concerned with the degradation of his tyres, which probably means he has only lost about a tenth of a second of his performance...if that.

LAP 24/59: Thankfully we have a good battle for the final podium spot going on. Ricciardo homing in on Stroll...

LAP 23/59: No changes out on front. Lewis Hamilton continues to lead Bottas by 1.7 seconds. It's the equivalent of a bully simply holding out his arm to prevent being attacked.

LAP 22/59: In comes Leclerc for the hard tyre, which means he will want to take that tyre to the end with no more stops. They have nothing to lose really - Ferrari are only going backwards,

LAP 21/59: A new lap but same old story for Leclerc. Now Perez is past him into turn one, and on top of his straight line speed deficit, he has lost lots of grip from his tyres.

Ferrari are already talking about Plan C.

LAP 20/59: Leclerc is a sitting duck. Everyone knows his weakness now and now Albon is past him for fifth. Mercedes are now 11 seconds clear of third placed Stroll.

LAP 19/59: The only way is backwards for Ferrari. Now Ricciardo blasts past Leclerc to take fourth,

LAP 18/59: Progress and regression for Racing Point. Stroll finally gets past Leclerc into turn one for third but Seregio Perez loses out to Alex Albon for sixth moments later.

LAP 17/59: Stroll is starting to have a nibble at Leclerc, but despite a Mercedes engine and DRS, he cannot make a move stick into turn one. Daniel Ricciardo is now an interested party...

LAP 16/59: Nice move from Sebastian Vettel who passes former Ferrari team-mate Raikkonen for 11th around the outside of turn one. 

LAP 15/59: Hamilton, now he is out of DRS, is just maintaining his advantage over Bottas now. Barring another crazy incident, this race is in the bag for him...

LAP 14/59: Leclerc though is driving confidently though, Lance Stroll in fourth is not putting too much pressure on him.

LAP 13/59: And now the gap from Mercedes to Leclerc is up to six seconds. They are only racing each other this afternoon, and by the way Hamilton is going even that is debatable.

LAP 12/59: Back up into the points for Russell who passes Raikkonen, meanwhile the good news for Bottas is DRS is now enabled.

The bad news is he cannot keep up with Hamilton to take advantage with the duo already split by 1.7 seconds.

LAP 11/59: Off and away go Mercedes then, as a train soon emerges behind Leclerc's Ferrari. Already the gap between Bottas and the Ferrari star is up to three seconds.

LAP 10/59: And Lewis Hamilton moves into the lead. He drives around the outside of Valtteri Bottas into turn one, despite his brakes having been smoking on the grid.

Leclerc maintains third for Ferrari while Kimi Raikkonen passes George Russell for 10th.

LAP 10/59: LIGHTS OUT (PART 2) No incidents at the restart, and Hamilton roars into the lead with Bottas tucking in behind, and the Racing Point's of Stroll and Perez in third and fourth #TuscanGP 🇮🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/FHFxfgv17W

The stopped race is also a positive for Hamilton, as after his first poor start he will now be looking for revenge on the restart.

The race will restart from lap nine, and here are how your top 13 line up for what will be another standing start.

1. Bottas, 2. Hamilton, 3. Leclerc, 4. Albon, 5. Stroll, 6. Ricciardo, 7. Perez, 8. Norris, 9. Kvyat, 10. Russell, 11. Raikkonen, 12. Vettel, 13. Grosjean.

Renault have also retired Esteban Ocon which means Russell is on course to earn his first points finish for Williams this afternoon. Long way to go yet.

'The crash was properly scary. Everyone tought wer were racing but then everyone strated braking. It is something we have to look into because the crash could have been worse. It is something to learn.'

'I don’t see that Bottas did anything wrong. Some of those behind were overeager. They restarted the race before the race had restarted – on the throttle, off the throttle.

'About 10 seconds of racing in half an hour and six cars are out.'

👀 A long view and a close-up of the crash that's brought the remaining drivers back into the pits It's the first time that we've had a Red Flag in consecutive races since 2011 - Monaco followed by Canada#TuscanGP 🇮🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/Z2QT1k1ckE

The race should be underway again in fewer than 10 minutes. Thankfully for most teams, damage can be repaired in this red flag period. About the only team with no concerns are, of course, those pesky front running Mercedes.

In fairness to Bottas, he did not actually do anything wrong. He didn't speed up and slow down again. Quite simply the cars behind him gambled on quickly getting going again, causing the cars to bunch up.

The drivers's cars are now in the pitlane awaiting the restart.

'That was f****** stupid from whoever was at the front. They want to kill us or what? This is the worst thing I have ever seen.'

LAP 8/59: There is so much debris on the track now that the cars have to go through the pitlane under the safety car.

In fact there is so much debris on the track, the race has been stopped. That second crash took out Carlos Sainz, Antonio Giovinazzi, Kevin Magnussen and Nicholas Latifi.

Thankfully everyone looks ok.

The incident brings out a RED FLAG 🚩Four drivers were involved in this crash - Giovinazzi, Latifi, Magnussen and Sainz - all are out of their cars and seemingly ok 👍#TuscanGP 🇮🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/vE0FuXm0A9

LAP 7/59: CARNAGE! Another safety car...

Valtteri Bottas, trying to avoid being caught in a slipstream bunches the pack up on the start-straight. The drivers fan across the track looking for space and it leads to a pile up which takes out four cars.

LAP 6/59 The Safety Car goes in but immediately there's a big shunt at the back of the field#TuscanGP 🇮🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/wt5hvIrVJd

LAP 6/59: Safety car is in at the end of this lap. George Russell is running 11th for Williams by the way.

LAP 5/59: So here are the top 10 as the drivers still tour behind the safety car:

1. Bottas, 2. Hamilton, 3. Leclerc, 4. Albon, 5. Stroll, 6. Ricciardo, 7. Perez, 8. Norris, 9. Kvyat, 10. Ocon

LAP 3/59: The big winner out of all this? It's Charles Leclerc, he is now up to third for Ferrari. He couldn't nab a shock podium at their 1,000th race could he? Big ask in that red milk float.

Safety car, which is red this weekend to honour Ferrari, is still leading Bottas and Hamilton around.

LAP 2/59: Verstappen was in fact punted off the circuit, while Pierre Gasly, last week's winner, is also out.

McLaren's Carlos Sianz was put into a spin while Sebastian Vettel was also an innocent bystander and he now runs last having had to pit for a front wing.

LAP 1/59: A very poor start from Lewis Hamilton who almost immediately is passed by Valtteri Bottas but the Brit retains second.

There are all sorts of problems heading into the first chicane too and it ends with Max Verstappen, who also made a dreadful start, beaching his car in the gravel and out the race. There are about six cars involved and that brings out the safety car.

Here is a reminder of the grid. Should be an interesting run down to turn one. Lewis Hamilton could be at risk of slipstream behind him to other drivers as well as facing a headwind.

The top 11 are on soft compound tyres.

'A hot day here making it doubly tough for the drivers around this demanding circuit. As Mark Webber said: it plays hell on the neck around those middle bends.

'I wonder if we’ll see a mistake through exhaustion.

'Ferrari president John Elkann is here, wearing a red jumper around his neck over his blazer. In 30C heat.

'He had a long chat with Leclerc on the grid and then they fist-pumped.

'Lewis made it in time to take the knee this week, unlike last Sunday in Monza.

'Andrea Bocelli sang the national anthem, which something of a treat.'

Mx Verstappen has had engine problems on the grid, but with just under 10 minutes until the start (and some frantic work!) Red Bull think they have it fixed.

Both Mercedes line up on the front row of the grid after once again dominating qualifying, but here is the full report from Saturday's action.

And part of the celebrations around that have been a look back at the past (because let's face it, the present isn't bringing much joy!)

Today Mick Schumacher has been driving around Mugello in his father Michael's Ferrari from 2004 - the car which the German won his seventh and final world championship in.

As painfully boring as that season was - Michael only failed to win one race before securing his title with a second place at Spa - what a car that was!

Mercedes domination or not, one big bonus for 2020 is having the chance to see F1 cars tour the magnificent pictureesque Mugello circuit.

It's one of the highlights of the year on the MotoGP calendar, let's hope the F1 boys can make it almost undropable  for the future.

Lewis Hamilton starts from the front ahead of our live coverage of the Tuscan Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton is looking to put more daylight between himself and his Formula One rivals at the Tuscan Grand Prix on Sunday. 

The six-time world champion secured his 95th pole position on Saturday ahead of Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, and he will be eyeing his sixth victory already this season. 

Sportsmail's Dan Ripley will provide live F1 coverage including lap-by-lap updates, fastest laps, pit stops and crashes.
