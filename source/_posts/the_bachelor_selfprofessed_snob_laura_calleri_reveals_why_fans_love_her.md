The Bachelor's Laura Calleri shocked viewers at the first cocktail party when she asked leading man Locky Gilbert if he'd be willing to buy her designer gifts.

But after being sent home on Wednesday's episode, the 25-year-old self-professed snob has gained a legion of fans who love her dry and sarcastic sense of humour.

She spoke to 10 Play about becoming an unlikely fan favourite after her less-than-favourable introduction.

'I suppose people were quite shocked at my red carpet and now they kind of love me and think I'm hilarious,' she said.

The marketing coordinator, who hails from Perth, admitted that the backlash she faced on social media after the first episode was tough.

'People are catching up on the series or stuck on episode one and won't like me, but it's interesting to see people's responses change from then until now. I'm just dry!' she said.

Laura said she was 'shocked' to learn she would be leaving the mansion alongside four other women on Wednesday's show.

'I didn't hear my name called out and I was shocked. Then I realised I was there with four other girls so I feel like that softened the blow,' she said.

After failing to receive a rose, Laura stormed out to a waiting car.

'Is he serious? He could have had a trophy wife, but nope. Fuming. F**king fuming!' she seethed.

After failing to find love on The Bachelor, Laura is hoping she will be cast on season four of Bachelor in Paradise. 

'Surely they would be able to do some good matchmaking for me now since I got ripped off by a guy that likes Bintang,' she said, taking a subtle swipe at Locky, who spends half the year living in Bali. 

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
