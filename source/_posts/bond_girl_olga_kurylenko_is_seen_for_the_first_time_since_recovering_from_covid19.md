Olga Kurylenko has been seen for the first time since recovering from COVID-19 as she headed out for a stroll with her former partner Max Benitz on Friday.

The Bond Girl, 40, revealed back in March that she was in self-quarantine after testing positive for the virus, and had been struggling with a 102F fever after being refused a hospital bed.

Olga stepped out for a walk with her ex Ben - with who she shares a son - before heading back to her home in London.

Olga opted for a casual black blazer and white shirt, which she teamed with cut-off jeans as she chatted to her former partner.

The Quantum of Solace star wore a black hat during the walk, her first sighting in six months. 

Olga was previously dating Argentine actor Ben Cura, but they split just before the COVID-19 outbreak hit.

Olga revealed back in the spring she'd been isolating at home after testing positive for the deadly virus, 

She first broke the news of her diagnosis as she took to Instagram to tell her followers her fever had finally gone, 24-hours after she was refused a hospital bed with a temperature of 102F (38.9C). 

Posting a picture of herself wearing a green medical mask, she wrote: 'Hello everyone! I'm feeling better today. My fever is gone! I hear people can't figure out where I currently am. I'm in London! 

'How do I know it's coronavirus and not just a flu? I did a test for coronavirus which came back positive. What are the medicines that doctors prescribed as treatment? NONE!

At-home methods: Olga went on to reveal that she was taking pantothenic acid (B5), vitamin E, vitamin C, curcumin (turmeric) and zinc to help her immune system

'I was told to take paracetamol in case my fever was too high and if I was in too much pain. However, I do take vitamins and supplements.'

Olga went on to reveal that she was taking pantothenic acid (B5), vitamin E, vitamin C, curcumin (turmeric) and zinc to help her immune system, although she stressed: 'Please note that these vitamins do NOT cure coronavirus.' 

The previous day Olga revealed that she was refused a hospital bed because the wards are 'full' of patients 'struggling with life.'

Fever: She also took to Instagram at the time to update fans on her condition and thank them for their messages of support

The Quantum of Solace star said she was struggling with a 102F fever shortly after testing positive for the virus.  

Olga said she did not know where she had contracted the virus, but suggested she could have picked it up from a taxi door handle.

The Seven Psychopaths star then took to Instagram in April to reveal she opted to cut her own fringe after salons were forced to close for almost four months due to the crisis.
