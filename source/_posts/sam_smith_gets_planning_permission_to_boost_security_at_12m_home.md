Sam Smith has been given the go-ahead by planners to step up security at their £12million home.

The Stay With Me star, 28, snapped up the five-bedroom Grade II listed Hampstead home where neighbours include Jude Law and Kate Moss last year.

But they wanted to upgrade the mansion's security system with CCTV cameras, motion sensors and entry system monitors.

In 2014, while Smith was performing at Glastonbury, burglars ransacked their former south London home - the second time it was raided in the same year.  

In a letter to the local council, Smith's planning agent said: 'The proposals have been drawn up following consultation with a security specialist and analysis of the security issues.

'It is considered that the upgrade of the CCTV in conjunction with an alarmed system will provide great benefit to the living conditions and security of the property's residents.'

Built in 1736, Sam's new detached Georgian house — once home to author Sir Kingsley Amis — boasts a reception hall, breakfast room and courtyard garden.

Smith needed planning permission because their home is Grade II listed and lies in a designated conservation area. 

Planners at Camden Council gave consent after there were no objections from neighbours.

Case officer Tony Young ruled: 'Overall, in terms of the design, size, colour, location, materials, the proposal is considered to preserve the character and appearance of the wider conservation area as well as the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building.

'The proposed external cameras would replace existing cameras which would continue to be directed towards entrance ways within the host property and so would not provide opportunities for invasion of privacy given the absence of views into neighbouring dwellings or the public realm.'
