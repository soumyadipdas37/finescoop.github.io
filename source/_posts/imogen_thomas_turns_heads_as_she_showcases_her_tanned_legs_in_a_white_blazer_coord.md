The brunette bombshell styled her silky locks in a straight 'do and sported a flawless makeup look that highlighted her bronzed complexion. 

Single-mother Imogen, who has two daughters with ex-partner Adam Horsley, recently admitted no-one has been 'good enough' to introduce to her children. 

She said in an interview with New! magazine last month: 'I cut guys off more than I eat hot dinners. 

'I'm savage and I'm not very nice to guys. I don't even know what I want myself, but I will know when he comes along.'   

The reality star, who rose to fame on Big Brother in 2006, also said lockdown has 'rebooted' her dating life. 

Imogen, who is a member of exclusive dating app Raya, explained how she is 'bored' of swiping and admitted there are a lot of people that she has dubbed 'Raya Players'.

The model, who split from former partner Adam in 2018 following a six-year relationship, also said she is cautious of introducing someone to her daughters Ariana, seven, and Siera, four.
