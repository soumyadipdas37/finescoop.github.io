Erika Jayne may have had her Broadway dreams dashed, as her run in Chicago was cut short by COVID-19.

But the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star isn't just moping around her mansion during quarantine.

She put on a sizzling display Saturday in a barely-there blue lingerie look, taking to Instagram with a sexy at-home photo shoot as Savage X Fenty's latest celebrity ambassador.

The 49-year-old showed off her toned figure in a blue lace thong with a matching underbust corset, featuring clear panels down the side.

She tied her cascading blonde hair down with a blue satin headscarf, finishing the look with black leather fingerless gloves and a pair of blue and fuchsia metallic six-inch stilettos.

She later fulfilled her ambassador duties, modeling several looks on her Instagram Story for her 2.1million followers.

She then sported a black tank top, printed with the logo in shimmering rainbow, paired with matching black leggings and white stilettos.

Erika also served Studio 54 in a black flared jumpsuit with spaghetti straps and a drawstring-tied cutout over her taut midriff.

She recently sparred against Denise Richards, as they joined their RHOBH costars for the virtual season 10 reunion. 

The Atlanta-born artist turned the tables on Richards, who took issue with the cast discussing 'threesomes' in front of her kids earlier in the season.

Erika told the Wild Things star: 'You opened with, "He still has a big penis." That was, like, the first thing out of your mouth at your own barbecue with your own children sitting right there. It comes out of your mouth first. You set the tone.'
