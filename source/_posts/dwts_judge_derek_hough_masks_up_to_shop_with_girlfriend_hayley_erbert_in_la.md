Dancing With the Stars judge Derek Hough and his girlfriend Hayley Erbert shopped for arts & crafts together at Michaels in Los Angeles on Monday.

At 35, the two-time Emmy-winning choreographer is a decade older than the Kansas-born brunette, whom he's been romancing for five years.

Derek and Hayley protected themselves and others from the coronavirus by wearing masks, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for public outings on June 18.

Hough and Erbert's street sighting came four days after publicly addressing whether or not they were planning on getting married on their vlog, Derek & Hayley x Dayley Life.

'100% I have thought [he'll never propose],' groaned the former pageant princess, who's got a folder full of wedding ideas.

'That thought has crossed through my mind and he says that he is waiting for me to propose to him. And I'm like, "Then we're never getting married."'
