Exeter Chiefs are not here to mess about any more.

They have enjoyed some big days out in their decent decade, sometimes happy to drink in the post-match ciders on the way home content they had even made it that far, but are now done with the heart-break, the near-misses and silver medals.

It is time to shake up the old order.

Henry Slade believes Exeter Chiefs can shake off their final woes and win the European Cup

In recent history only teams with overgrown wallets or long-established dynasties have lifted the European Cup.

Perhaps only Brive in 1997, Ulster in 1999 and Northampton in 2000 have broken up the run of either rich or establishment winners on the continent.

So for Henry Slade and his Chiefs, Europe is due a new conqueror.

‘There are teams left that are notoriously very good in Europe, and have been big names, but we feel like it’s irrelevant,’ he tells Sportsmail in an exclusive interview.

‘We’re confident and will back ourselves against anyone.

‘We have massive respect for the teams left, but history doesn’t mean anything in the present does it?

‘It’s all about who does it this year, and that’s hopefully going to be us.’

Despite their now permanent residency at the top of English rugby’s domestic tables, Sunday will be only Exeter’s second European quarter-final.

Four years ago they let slip a 24-11 lead against Wasps losing, with the last Jimmy Gopperth kick, by a point.

‘It was tough to take,’ Slade explains.

Exeter Chiefs have now lost the Premiership final to Saracens three times since 2016

‘At that stage of the club’s development we were happy to be in a quarter-final. It’s different this time.’

Since they have won the league just once, and been beaten by Saracens in Premiership finals three times – each one feeling sicker, especially knowing now that their rivals cheated their way to those titles.

‘It’s gutting,’ says Slade.

‘Every one gets harder. The last one left me absolutely distraught.

‘We never want to feel that again. That is still burning in the bellies of the boys and hopefully it spurs us on.’

It was a 31-12 away win at La Rochelle 10 months ago this week that Exeter kicked-off their European campaign with a marquee victory.

They went unbeaten through the pool stage, drawing only to Glasgow in January, to set up Sunday’s quarter-final against Northampton originally due to be played in April.

With the form Saints are in – after six defeats in seven since rugby’s restart – most expect Exeter to walk into the semi-finals.

Sunday's game against Gloucester will only be Exeter's second European quarter-final

But Slade is focussed.

‘We know we’ve got a tough Saints side coming down who are hurting. That can make a team very dangerous.

‘You can stumble with what’s in front of you if you look too far ahead.’

While desperate for success, Slade himself is a lot freer these days.

Not in the sense that he has more time – that notion turned to dust when his partner Megan gave birth to daughter Olive last month – but now his anxieties have eased.

It is tricky to imagine that a player who looks so elegant and poised on the field, with a permanently perfect Devon sun-tan, has spent most of his career feeling so up-tight and in such a wrestle with his mental-health that he has felt he cannot perform properly.

Thankfully he has broken a cycle of OCD and now 27 we might at last see the most at-ease version of the Exeter and England centre yet.

'I felt like if I didn’t do things right – tying shoelaces, switching off lights – I’d get injured or bad things would happen to my family or friends,’ Slade explains.

‘It started when I was a little kid, 8 or 9, and I broke it just a couple of years ago.

‘On the pitch I was telling myself “that might be crap, because I haven’t done this right”.

‘I ended up thinking “the way I turn the light off isn’t going to affect how I play or how someone’s health is going to be”.

‘It immediately felt a massive weight off my shoulders. I wasn’t worrying about things as intensely.

‘Positivity is so much better for you mentally and when you’re playing.’

Slade jokes that team-mate Luke Cowan-Dickie will be used to scare men off his daughter

Olive’s arrival has helped too.

‘I don’t know if I like waking up at night to change a shitty nappy but I’m enjoying most of it!’ Slade laughs.

‘Seeing her being born was an unbelievable experience. It’s the best feeling ever – I couldn’t speak for three hours.

‘I’ve always tried to find ways of relaxing outside of rugby, because you can’t be thinking about it all the time.

‘The season is so long, and now they’re moulding into one you need a chance to relax and take your mind off things. I used to play Call of Duty, now I’m changing nappies!’

Now she has squad of hulking uncles, pity the poor bloke who becomes Olive’s first boyfriend.

‘There’s that series Money Heist where they’re in a gang and one of the daughters has a boy wanting to take her out,’ smiles Slade looking into the future.

‘He brings her inside and the whole gang are waiting in the garage!

Slade admits Exeter are 'a bunch of misfits' but that it makes for a good and diverse squad

‘It’ll be like that – I’ll get Dave Ewers round, Luke Cowan-Dickie… the big lads to scare him off! “Make sure she’s home before nine!”’

They are tighter than most down in Devon. Moulded in the image of boss Rob Baxter the Chiefs are expected to out-work everyone – the non-negotiable standard set – but also enjoy themselves.

With a squad full of dodgy haircuts, sprawling tattoos, sons of fisherman, pigeon-racers and butchers as well as muscle-car drivers, hunters, eccentrics and the best from out west it is also clear they are encouraged to be themselves.

‘We’re a bunch of misfits really,’ says Slade, who grew up in the south Devon village of Yealmpton.

‘It makes for a good and diverse squad.’

The move from old-school Championship dirt-trackers to England’s elite has been gradual, always with a nod back to an amateur past.

‘We transitioned from the old-fashioned rugby club stuff of beers on the way back,’ says Slade before interrupting himself.

‘Well, we still have beers on the way back from a tough game, but it’s different.

‘We make time and days for beers together. That’s when you learn most about each other, after a couple of pints.

‘Exeter is an awesome place to be. On the rugby side we are going really well and have a great group of players and coaches.

‘Outside that, I’m from here, but the South West is such a nice place to live.

‘The beaches are nearby, the moors are close, and Exeter is not the biggest place so the boys live near each other.

‘That combination of factors is why people enjoy it so much down here.

‘It makes you feel very proud looking at the journey the club has been on, having been there for pretty much all of it.’

But Slade and Exeter are no longer starry-eyed. The only stars they are interested in are ones they can stitch on their shirts.
