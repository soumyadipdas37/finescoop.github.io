'I love SKIMS because it makes me feel more secure in myself, like I can love myself just the way I am.'

Delilah and Amelia - who have both struggled with eating disorders - were photographed last week by lenswoman Donna Trope.

The Hamlin Sisters were styled by Italian performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, who's collaborated with Kim and her third husband Kanye West on their wedding, music videos, fashion shows, and listening parties.

The New School drop-out and the NYU drop-out both got depressed when they lived in New York and promptly moved back to Los Angeles where they share a house discovered by Kyle Richards' realtor daughter Alexia Umansky.
