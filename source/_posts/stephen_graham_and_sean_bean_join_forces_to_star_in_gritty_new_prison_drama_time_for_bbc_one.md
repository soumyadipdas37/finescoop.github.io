Stephen Graham and Sean Bean are teaming up to star in a three-part prison drama series called Time for BBC One. 

The Irishman actor, 47, and the Game of Thrones star, 61, will play the lead roles in the show, which examines the British penal system through the eyes of two men.

According to Deadline, Sean stars as Mark Hebden, a married father and teacher who killed an innocent man in an accident and, consumed by guilt, accepts his four-year sentence.

Separated from his family, he has to learn to adapt quickly to his new environment  in order to survive.

Stephen portrays a prison officer named Eric Reid, whose kindhearted nature is taken advantage of by a dangerous inmate.

The series will be directed by Lewis Arnold, known for his work on the hit science fiction series Humans.

The series will be the second time Stephen and Sean appear alongside each other as they previously starred together in British TV show Accused by screenwriter Jimmy McGovern, who is also writing Time.

Sean said of the series: 'Getting to be involved in a Jimmy McGovern drama again is a real privilege and it will be great to be reunited with Stephen. 

'Mark Hebden is another of Jimmy’s complex and superbly-written characters and I am looking forward to bringing him to life on screen.'

Stephen added: 'It is an absolute honour to be working with Jimmy again, I’m feeling blessed. I’m excited to be working with Lewis as I have heard so many incredible things about him as a director, I can’t wait to get stuck in. Of course, I am made up to be back on set with Sean.'

Stephen, who is also known for his role as John Corbett in Line of Duty, previously admitted he suffered from 'imposter syndrome for a long time' due to his working class background.

The star confessed he previously thought he 'didn't deserve' to be successful in the acting industry, but expressed his gratitude towards his parents for making his career 'possible' in a new interview for Rankin's Hunger Magazine.

He said: 'I suffered a lot with that imposter syndrome for a long time, that working-class mentality of "I don’t deserve to here".'

Thanking his relatives for supporting his path, the Boardwalk Empire actor added: 'If it wasn’t for my mum and dad, and if it wasn’t being able to get a grant to go to college, it would never have been possible for me.

'My fear is how many people lose out on those opportunities because they’re not given the opportunity to at least have a go at it, which is very sad.'
