Millie Bobby Brown has revealed that she struggled to do a British accent in her new role Enola Holmes after five years in the American Netflix series Stranger Things. 

The actress, 16, who shot to fame as Eleven in the hit Netflix show, revealed she 'found it really challenging being British' in the role of the upcoming mystery film. 

Millie, who grew up in Dorset, England, and settled in Florida with her family to pursue her acting career aged eight, said she 'had to learn how to speak again'.

Speaking to Radio Times, she said: 'For the last five years I’ve been playing an American character in Stranger Things and I found it really challenging being British in this, even though I am a Brit. 

'I had to learn how to speak again because I’m so used to speaking in an American accent.'  

Millie, who has produced and starred as the title character, the sister of Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill), revealed that she 'wouldn't make a good detective' because she 'can't even find my keys'

Role: Millie has produced and starred as the title character in the upcoming mystery film Enola Holmes - the sister of Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill)

Yet the star explained how she is 'good at reading people' which she believes is linked to being 'observant of people’s emotions'. 

Millie, who rose to fame aged 12 in Stranger Things, described how Enola 'brings a new perspective on the Holmes family' and is a role which she can 'definitely relate' to.

The actress and her elder sister Paige 'fell in love' with the character after reading the Nancy Springer series, The Enola Holmes Mysteries, and felt compelled to bring 'girl power' to a film set. 

Speaking about the emotional connection to her character, she added: 'Loneliness is something that a lot of teenagers suffer with — I myself have — and the film portrays that being alone is a good thing because you can find yourself.'    

In the film, the youngest member of the Holmes family goes off in search of her missing mother (Helena Bonham Carter), even as her more famous brothers try to thwart her investigation. 

She journeys back to her childhood and how her mother gave her her name, which is 'alone' spelled backward. 

The film was originally planned for a theatrical release by Warner Bros., but it was picked up by Netflix in April amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
