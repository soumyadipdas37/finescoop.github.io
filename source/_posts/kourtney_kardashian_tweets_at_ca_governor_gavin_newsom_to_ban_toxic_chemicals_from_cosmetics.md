'What are toxic chemicals like #mercury and #formaldehyde doing in cosmetics anyways,' she wrote. 

Adding: '@CAGovernor @GavinNewsom can lead the way by banning these ingredients from personal care products sold in California,' the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star wrote. 'Just like in the EU.' 

She was sure to add the hashtag '#AB2762,' which is a recent a recent bill, also known as the Toxic-Free Cosmetics Act, passed by the California state legislature on Sunday.

The chemicals, known as the 'Toxic Twelve' are banned from products in the European Union and a total of 40 countries. 

It is co-sponsored by activist group Environmental Working Group (EWG), Black Women for Wellness, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners and CalPIRG. 

The mother-of-three went to Washington D.C. in 2018 to lobby for the Personal Care Products Safety Act, alongside EWG. 

That bill, requiring the FDA to regulate beauty and cosmetics products, was introduced by CA Senator Diane Feinstein in March 2019 but has not yet moved through Congress.

Bonding over beauty: Kourtney has long discussed her love for clean beauty and shared her favorite products, including contour sticks from her little sister Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty line. Her new BFF, TikTok star Addison Rae is also launching a clean beauty, ITEM Beauty 

'As a mom, you really take so much interest in the products… and it’s so crazy,' she said at the time according to Well + Good. 'I would get so many baby gifts and a lot of it was products, skin-care products for my kids. And I would use the things that people sent me just assuming these are baby products and that they should be safe.' 

She then advocated for regulations to product consumers saying 'You shouldn’t have to walk around aimlessly asking "Is this okay?" "Is this not okay?" Everybody should have the right to healthy products.'
