This is the moment a pedestrian chased a transit tipper suspected of fly-tipping down a track strewn with rubbish and building rubble in Doncaster. 

Video footage, taken in Long Sandall, shows a man sprinting down an off-road path towards a white van suspected of fly-tipping, which is parked on the track and is filled with bricks.

The walker passes piles of rubbish that have been left strewn across the remote path, including large pieces of cardboard, bricks and other building rubble.

As the pedestrian approaches the white transit tipper, an individual standing outside the truck gets back into the vehicle and drives away, the video shows.

The person filming walks down the path behind the suspected fly tipper's truck and watches the individual drive away from the incident.

Twitter page We Hate Fly-Tipping shared the video on Twitter on September 28, where it has received more than 39,000 views from angry residents.

The caption alongside the video read: 'A gold medal should go to this member of the public who sprinted down a track to catch a fly-tipper on video in Long Sandall, Doncaster.' 

People expressed their fury at the suspected fly-tipping, with some urging drivers to take their rubbish to the dump instead.

South Yorkshire Police said that it does not investigate fly-tipping, adding that this issue is dealt with by the local council.

Save Long Sandall, who posted the video on Facebook on June 9, said that the incident had been reported to the 'relevant authorities'.

Doncaster was previously revealed to be the fourth-worst fly-tipping hotspot in the UK in 2019, Doncaster Free Press reported.

More than 23,000 fly-tipping incidents occurred in Doncaster in 2018 and 2019, while Sheffield ranked fifth with 22,000 incidents recorded across the same period.

Recycling firm The Furniture Recycling Group also found that 501,226 incidents of fly-tipping were recorded across 77 of England's major towns and cities over the same two-year period. 

The coronavirus pandemic has reportedly also affected fly-tipping, with staff from many departments being moved to other areas to help with the crisis, Doncaster Free Press reported. 

Reports seen by councillors revealed that only 59 per cent of fly-tipping calls were cleared in the seven-day target period, whereas the council normally aims to clear 85 per cent of reports in a week.

The coronavirus lockdown, which came into force in March, also saw more household rubbish being produced as people stayed in their homes for longer periods of time than normal.

MailOnline have contacted Doncaster Council for comment.
