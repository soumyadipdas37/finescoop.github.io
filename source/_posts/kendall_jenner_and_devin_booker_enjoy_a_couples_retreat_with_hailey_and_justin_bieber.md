Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker enjoyed a couples retreat in Idaho with pals Hailey and Justin Bieber.

The famous four were spotted hanging out together at Coeur d'Alene on Tuesday.

Kendall, 24, wore a tie-dye crop top as she walked down a road with her beau, 23, who was clad in a black T-shirt and backwards hat.

Nearby, Justin, 26, and Hailey, 23, strolled at a leisurely pace.

Hailey wore a grey crop top, biker shorts, white sneakers, and a jacket dangling over her shoulders, while her husband opted for a flashier look with his hot pink shirt.

Justin enjoyed the sunshine in a button down shirt, black shorts, and backwards cap.

The Baby hit-maker managed to walk down the road even with his attention fully locked on his phone.

In the driver's seat: Hailey drove Justin around in their golf cart

Fun with friends: Also joining the group was Justin's long-time road manager, Ryan Good, who strode at the front of the pack

Hailey, Justin, Kendall, and Devin have been making the most of their time in the great outdoors these last few days.

Hailey and Justin have been spotted splashing around the waterfront, while Kendall has been posting snippets from her time in the great outdoors.

On top of sharing sizzling bikini snaps, Kendall shared a peaceful video of her set-up at the lake.

Kendall laid out two striped towels upon a dock, which bobbed about with the current.

In addition to laying out beneath the sunshine, Kendall went jetskiing and  enjoyed an evening by the campfire.

Kendall and Devin have been hanging out more and more frequently during quarantine.

The duo have been at the center of dating rumors for the last few months, but in mid-August they all but confirmed the speculation during a PDA-infused beach day.

Devin had previously dated Jordyn Woods, who was cast out from the Kardashian–Jenner orbit after Khloé Kardashian's then-partner Tristan Thompson kissed her at a party.
