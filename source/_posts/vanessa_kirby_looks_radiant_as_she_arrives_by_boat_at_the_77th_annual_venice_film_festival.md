She is promoting her latest film The World To Come during this year's Venice Film Festival. 

And Vanessa Kirby looked radiant as ever as she arrived for the eighth day of the festival by boat alongside fellow star Katherine Waterston.

The actress, 32, cut an elegant figure for the festivities, donning a beige knee-length coat while she cinched her waist with a matching strap.

The star also wore a black long-sleeved top with a turtle neck and a pair of slim-fitting trousers.

Adding height to her frame with a pair of boots, Vanessa carried a black handbag with her for her day in the Italian city.

Letting her blonde locks hang loose, The Crown star completed her look by sporting a pair of sunglasses.  

Vanessa's new movie The World To Come is set on the American East Coast in the mid-19th century, where two neighbouring couples battle hardship and isolation, and is based upon Jim Shepard's novel of the same name.

The blonde is known to many for her role as young Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, which she played for the show's first two seasons.

In 2018, the thespian appeared in Mission Impossible: Fallout, and is expected to reprise her role in the upcoming seventh film, which recently resumed filming after being delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Earlier this year, Vanessa spoke exclusively to The Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye about preparing for her upcoming role in Pieces Of A Woman.

The actress plays Martha, a Boston woman who loses her baby during a traumatic home birth, and explained that she spent time with a midwife and a paediatrician at the Whittington Hospital in North London in preparation. 

She said: 'I couldn't have acted that, because I've never given birth myself,' she told me. 

'Just by pure chance an amazing woman allowed me to watch her give birth. I didn't know her but she was so generous and allowed me to be there when her boy was born.'
