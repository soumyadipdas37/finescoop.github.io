A couple claim an attempted break-in at their home is to blame after their dog escaped their property and mauled a little girl.

Dog owner Hayley-Jay Hounslow and her partner Jaime Proietti fronted Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday following the incident in April 2019.

Hounslow's American Staffy, named Hudson, had escaped the couple's Mount Gravatt East home before setting upon a little girl, the Courier Mail reported.   

She was left with injuries that required surgery and a partial amputation of her ear while the dog was later euthanised.

Hounslow and Proietti were both away from home but returned following the attack and were questioned by council investigators.

The court heard in an interview Hounslow claimed her dog did not jump over or dig under the 120cm wire mesh enclosure that housed the American Staffy.

She claimed her partner found the mesh cut and scratches around the window as well as a smudge on the glass pane.   

Council's Zoe Sinclair said in the interview there was a lack of witnesses to back up claims of a break-in.

'Nobody heard anything, saw anything suspicious … can you see how this looks?' she said.

Prosecutor Mark Thomas said the outcome of the case hinged on whether or not the pair had taken adequate steps to keep the dog on the property. 

Hounslow has pleaded guilty to failing to register the dog with Brisbane City Council.

She has pleaded not guilty to failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the dog did not attack a person and failing to ensure it did not wander.

Proietti has pleaded not guilty to all three charges. 

She was left with injuries that required surgery and a partial amputation of her ear while the dog was later euthanised
