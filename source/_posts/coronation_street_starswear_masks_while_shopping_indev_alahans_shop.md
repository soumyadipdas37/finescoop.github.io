The soap was previously criticised for the lack of mask wearing in Dev Alahan's shop.

And it appears that coronavirus has reached the cobbles as Sally Metcalfe (played by Sally Dynevor) and Debbie Webster (Sue Devaney) covered their faces while getting their shopping in the store in scenes set to air next week.

Sally was seen wearing a simply black face mask, while Debbie opted to wrap a white scarf around her nose and mouth instead.

While his customers wore masks, Dev (Jimmi Harkishin) could be seen without a mask, while there appeared to be no antibacterial gel on the counter.

Meanwhile, during a hospital visit Leanne Tilsley (Jane Danson) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) kept a 2 metre distance from each other and their fellow cast member who played the doctor chatting to them.

The medical professional was later seen in her PPE as she protected herself using gloves and a surgical mask for a day at work.

Last month, the ITV soap saw characters Sally and Alya Nazir (Sair Khan) discussing Alya's jailed grandmother Yasmeen while standing next to bright yellow social distancing signs. 

But some viewers were put out by the scenes as the character's failed to use masks despite face coverings now being compulsory to wear in shops, with one remarking: 'Why are the people of Weatherfield above the law?'

Though Sally and Alya were standing the regulated two metres apart, fans called out the duo for reportedly breaking the rules.

Taking to Twitter, one person wrote: 'I thought face masks were now compulsory in shops? Why are the people of weatherfield above the law? Very irresponsible behaviour. They’ll be responsible for the 2nd wave! #Corrie.'

'Sally is gonna give us a second wave! im fumed!' tweeted a second.

With another person adding: 'Typical politician, breaking the rules she created.'

However, many were quick to point out that the new rules making masks mandatory in shops came into effect on July 24th, while Coronation Street is filmed several weeks in advance.

'They’re not up to date as yet. You’ll see it soon I’m sure', tweeted one viewer.

While another agreed: 'Filmed before it was made compulsory.'

'No, they weren't. Facemasks in shops have only been compulsory for just about 10 days or so. Corrie went back to work over a month ago and many scenes are filmed way out of context' said a third.

With another watcher adding: 'It said the programme was filmed in march so not applicable.'



Grumblings: Taking to Twitter, one person wrote: 'I thought face masks were now compulsory in shops? Why are the people of weatherfield above the law?

In addition, an ITV spokesperson has previously pointed out: 'We'd appreciate the audience respecting that new episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale were recorded before the recent health and safety legislation.

'Some scenes will be out of kilter with what is happening in the real world.'

Coronation Street's cast and crew returned to work in June- stepping foot on the famous set for the first time in almost three months.
