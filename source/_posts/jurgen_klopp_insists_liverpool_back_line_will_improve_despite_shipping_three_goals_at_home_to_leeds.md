Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insisted he was satisfied with his side's performance despite conceding three goals in their thrilling season opener against Leeds on Saturday night. 

The champions led three times but were pegged back on each occasion by Marcelo Bielsa's fearless side.

Virgil van Dijk was at fault for Leeds' second goal by Patrick Bamford and Mateusz Klich was left unmarked to flash a volley past Alisson for the third.

A thrilling encounter was settled by hat-trick hero Mohamed Salah's spot-kick in the 88th minute for a 4-3 victory.

He said: 'I said before the game we would struggle against them because the way they play is uncomfortable and it is different to all the other teams.

'If you don't respect the opponent they kill you in a football way and I liked a lot the attitude of my team today. I have to say they just don't stop, I like it.

'I didn't see us struggling defensively but the way they play you cannot defend 100 per cent of the time.

Virgil van Dijk was criticised for his mistake that led to Patrick Bamford's goal at Anfield

'For the first goal both full-backs were deeper than the centre-halves and that should never happen in football. The second goal was a misunderstanding between Virgil and Ali (Alisson Becker) and I don't think we will see these situations very often.

'The third one we changed Hendo (Jordan Henderson) not long before and our formation was moving and we didn't close one gap.

'The back line (of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Van Dijk and Andy Robertson) played for England, Holland and Scotland four days ago - all top teams but different ways of defending.

'And if things are not settled early in pre-season defending is not riding a bike - so there is space for improvement.'
