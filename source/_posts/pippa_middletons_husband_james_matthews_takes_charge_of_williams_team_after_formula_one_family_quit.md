Pippa Middleton's husband took charge of the Williams Formula One team on Thursday.

James Matthews, the multi-millionaire hedge-fund manager who married Prince William's sister-in-law Pippa in 2017, is among three new board members, following the acquisition of the business last month by New York-based private investment company Dorilton Capital.

Dorilton chairman Matthew Savage and co-founder Darren Fultz will share command.

 Claire Williams has been acting as deputy team principal to her father Sir Frank since 2013. They are both pictured in discussion during the British Grand Prix in 2019

The news came as the Williams family's connection ended after more than 40 years with the resignation of de facto team principal Claire Williams, who has acted as the de facto boss of the British team since 2013.

The future of Williams, 44, had been in doubt since the change of ownership. Sources insist it was her decision to quit, a change that will take effect after this weekend's Italian Grand Prix.

Her role will be filled, for now, by a senior internal figure before a new permanent team principal is appointed.

As for Sir Frank Williams, 78, he will move out of his apartment at the factory in Grove, Oxfordshire - a symbolic break from the team he created in 1977 and led to 16 world titles through such drivers as Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill.

Sir Frank will no longer be involved in Formula One after it was announced that one of the sport's best-known families are stepping aside.

Claire Williams said: 'It is with a heavy heart that I am stepping down. I had hoped to continue my tenure long into the future and to preserve the family's legacy into the next generation.

'But I have taken the decision to step away in order to allow Dorilton a fresh start. It is not an easy decision but one I believe is right for all concerned.' 

Both drivers, Britain's George Russell and Canadian Nicholas Lafiti, will continue unchanged.

Williams, winners of 16 drivers' and constructors' world championships, were sold last month to US investment firm Dorilton Capital.

The Williams name will leave the sport following this weekend's Italian Grand Prix. The identity of the team's replacements are yet to be confirmed.

Claire Williams said: 'With the future of the team now secured, this feels like the appropriate time for us to step away from the sport.

'We believe now is the right time to hand over the reins and give the new owners the opportunity to take the team into the future.

Williams Racing have been a family-run team since their founding in 1977 but have fallen on hard times in recent years and were recently sold to US investment firm Dorilton Capital

'We have been in this sport for more than four decades. We are incredibly proud of our track record and the legacy we leave behind.

'We have always been in it for the love of it, for the pure pleasure of going motor racing, so this is not a decision that we have taken lightly but after much reflection and as a family.

'This may be the end of an era for Williams as a family-run team, but it is the beginning of a new era for Williams Racing and we wish them much success in the future.'

Williams's heyday came in the 1980s and 1990s when Sir Frank technical director Patrick Head helped build one of the biggest and successful teams in the Formula One paddock

Sir Frank Williams, 78, founded the team in 1977 but has been competing in F1 since 1969 when he purchased a Brabham chassis to run his drivers. 

Williams enjoyed a remarkable rise in the sport, with the team winning the world championship with Alan Jones in 1980 as a team led by Sir Frank and his technical director Patrick Head started to gain prominence in the sport.

By 1986, he had arguably the best team on the grid with heavyweights Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet driving for him, even if their rivalry cost them the world championship.

Despite a car accident in the same year that saw him wheelchair bound, Williams continued to run the team from the front and Williams' dominance continued in 1987 when Piquet strolled to title success.

While the 1980s saw them become an established front running team with title wins for Jones, Keke Rosberg in 1982 and Piquet, the 1990s would herald a new era of dominance.

Every top driver wanted to race for Williams and it brought title success for Mansell in 1992 and Prost in 1993, while Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve also tasted championship glory in 1996 and 1997 respectively.

Drivers titles (7): Alan Jones (1980), Keke Rosberg (1982), Nelson Piquet (1987), Nigel Mansell (1992), Alain Prost (1993), Damon Hill (1996), Jacques Villeneuve (1997)

Constructors titles (9): 1980, 1981, 1986, 1987, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997  

The legendary Ayrton Senna also landed a highly sought drive with the team in 1994 but was tragically killed at the San Marino GP just three races into his spell with the team.

Williams remained competitive into the early 2000s as Michael Schumacher and Ferrari started to wrestle control but gradually faded away following the 2004 season when Juan Pablo Montoya took the team's penultimate F1 victory. 

The team have won just one race since Montoya's Brazilian GP success, when Pastor Maldonado took a shock win at the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix.

A year later Sir Frank passed the day-to-day running of the team over to his daughter Claire.

They have finished bottom of the constructors' championship for the past two seasons, and are without a point in 2020 with the team having struggled to compete financially with their rivals. 

Williams dominated the sport throughout much of the 1990s, with star drivers including Alain Prost, who won the title with the team in 1993, desperate to drive for Sir Frank

Claire Williams added: 'On behalf of Frank and the Williams family, I would like to say how incredibly grateful and humbled we are for the support we have enjoyed over the years, from our friends in the paddock to the many fans around the world.

'But mostly, we would like to thank our team. People who have worked at Williams in the past and present.

'They are the true warriors of this team and have made it what it is and we wish them well. Formula One has been our life for so long and now it's time for a new chapter in our lives to begin.'

Despite a tie-up with BMW, Williams gradually fell away from the front of the pack at the turn of the century. Sir Frank is pictured at the launch of his 2004 challenger
