She recently returned to Los Angeles after taking a lengthy and relaxing trip to Turkey.

And Amber Heard was spotted embarking on a hike in the City Of Angels with a female pal on Monday evening.

The 34-year-old actress sported a noticeably makeup-free face as she lowered her bandana to catch her breath.

Amber's bright blonde hair was pulled back into a messy bun and she appeared to be having a passionate conversation with her friend.

Heard, who decided to go braless for her hike, donned a plain black tee that showcased her taut midsection.

She also had on a pair of black athletic leggings and she had a blue flannel shirt tied around her waist. 

The Rum Diary star slipped her feet into a pair of comfortable black trainers.

Earlier in the day, Amber took to Instagram to share a gorgeous makeup-free selfie as she relished in the joy that a late morning in Los Angeles inspires.

'Nothing like a late morning back in California,' she captioned.

In the post, Heard posed with her mouth slightly agape and held her camera at low angle.

The sun poked through her hair bright blonde hair and she wore an off-the-shoulder top.

Though she appeared happy to be back home, Amber clearly enjoyed her time in Turkey, often documenting the picturesque destination on her Instagram.

On Thursday, the Aquaman star shared a sunset shot to the photo-sharing site as she ended her time in the country.

She looked effortlessly beautiful in a plunging black dress as she drank red wine on a boat.

Amber smiled subtly as she lounged barefoot on the boat, with a red scarf wrapped around her head. 

'So hard to say goodbye.... I love Turkey so much,' wrote the starlet on her post.

The actress' trip came after she testified in July in the United Kingdom in the high-profile lawsuit brought against her by ex-husband Johnny Depp.

The couple were married from 2015 until 2017, after they met on the set of The Rum Diary in 2009.

Depp, 57, charged Heard with libel after accusations were leveled against him of being a 'wife beater' among other things.

The weeks-long trial saw multiple shocking claims brought from both sides, with the headline-making proceedings coming to an end in July.

A verdict on the trial is not expected to be announced until early September.
