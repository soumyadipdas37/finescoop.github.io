A nurse was left with blood pouring from gash on the side of her head after being attacked by a patient in hospital. 

The patient, a 26-year-old man, was receiving treatment when he punched a security guard, a 40-year-old man, at Westmead Hospital in Sydney's west at 5am on Friday. 

He then punched a nurse, a 31-year-old woman, in the back of the head before grabbing on to her, causing her to fall and hit her head on a door. 

She was left with a deep gash running through the middle of her forehead and deep into her scalp, which caused blood to gush out.

The nurse was transferred to a nearby hospital for further treatment while the 26-year-old man was eventually restrained and sedated by hospital staff. 

She later posted photos of her graphic injuries to Facebook to raise awareness for the violence healthcare workers face on the job.

'No one should go to work and have this happen to them. Work should be a safe place,' she captioned the post. 

'If you present to an Emergency Department you should treat all our staff - clerical, admin, porters, wardsmen, allied health, doctors and nurses - with utmost respect.'  

The security guard had been punched in the face and arm and was treated for minor injuries at the scene.  

Officers from Parramatta Police Area Command were called to the hospital and are currently investigating.
