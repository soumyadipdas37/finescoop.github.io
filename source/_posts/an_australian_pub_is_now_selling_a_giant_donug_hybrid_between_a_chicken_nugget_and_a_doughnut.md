Food lovers can now get their hands on a weird and wonderful 'Donug' hybrid between a chicken nugget and a doughnut in Australia.

The Red Hill Hotel in Melbourne dates back 165 years and has introduced the huge chicken nugget doughnut to the menu. 

The savoury 'donug' is made from a delicious free-range chicken mix, coated in crispy panko crumbs and topped with sauce.

The 'donug' is best served with hot chips and a cold beer, and customers can choose between three different toppings including cheese, curry or chilli.

Customers on social media shared their excitement and seemed very eager to try the chicken doughnut for themselves.

'That is amazing!' one woman said, and another man added: 'Awesome! Looks so good!'

Married couple Crag Carrick and his chef wife Rachel Dutton started selling the unique hybrid food in 2018 after launching their business and appeared on Shark Tank. 

The Melbourne couple sealed a $100,000 deal after pitching their culinary idea.

'I'm not changing the world with this product. I'm giving something that's fun, it's easy to understand, people get it straight away,' Mr Carrick explained to the judging panel.

Ms Dutton is the chef behind the business - combining the two humble fast foods together

The fried finger food called Donugs is a cross between a chicken nugget and a doughnut

'Nothing's sweet about it. All savoury product. It's 98 per cent chicken that has our unique and top-secret spice mix that goes through it,' Mr Carrick explained. 

'It's got then a cornflakes and panko crumb and three different sauces - a cheesy dijon bechamel, a golden Japanese curry and mozzarella, a hot chilli, or you can have it just on its own.' 

After seeing quirky food trends sweeping social media from Japan and LA, Mr Carrick said he wanted to create something crazy too.

 RedBalloon founder Naomi Simson offered the pair $100,000 for 25 per cent of the business

'I want this to be the crazy new food trend coming out of Melbourne,' he said.

And so he teamed up with his chef wife, who has been in the food industry for 15 years, to whip up a combination of the two humble fast foods.

'It's made with care, it's a chef's recipe,' Mr Carrick added.

Besides the delicious taste, the investors were far more impressed with the numbers.

Donugs sell for $9 a pop but cost just a measly $2.20 to make - but the figure will rise to $4 at production cost - that's still a 225 per cent return and a 125 per cent profit.
