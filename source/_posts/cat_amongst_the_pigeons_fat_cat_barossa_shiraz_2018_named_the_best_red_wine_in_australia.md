A $23.99 bottle of Shiraz has been crowned the best red wine in Australia after beating more than 400 rivals at a prestigious awards show.

The Cat Amongst the Pigeons Fat Cat Barossa Shiraz 2018 took home three awards, including the most coveted prize of 'Most Outstanding Barossa Wine'.

The red wine was also named 'Best Shiraz' and the 'Most Outstanding Barossa Red Table Wine' during the Barossa Wine Show in South Australia on Thursday night.

'The Barossa is the home of Shiraz in Australia, so to win any award for a Shiraz from the regional Barossa Wine Show is an incredible honour,' winemaker Richard Quodling said.

'A wine is not only an expression of grapes and terroir by a winemaker. It takes an entire team to make a great wine, from viticulturists, growers and lab technicians to cellar hands and packaging teams - so we are all excited and will be celebrating this weekend.'

Judge Nick Ryan described the quality drop as 'utterly delicious'.

'[This wine is] plush, fragrant, deeply flavoured, utterly delicious, incredible drinkable. A fantastic result for the people's wine,' he said.

The Cat Among the Pigeons Fat Cat Grenache 2019 also took out a gold medal in the awards show. 

The annual Barossa Wine Show, first held in 1977, is seen as a 'showpiece' of the region's very best wines. 

The judging panel tasted their way through more than 400 Barossa wines over three days to award the stand-outs in quality and regional expression.

Wine aficionados have shared glowing reviews on the red wine, describing it as 'smooth', 'excellent', 'delicious' and great value for money.

'True to it's regionalism and great value. If you're considering paying $35-$40 for a Barossa shiraz, put that bottle down and pick up a Fat Cat,' one said.

Another added: 'I am a beginner for red wine. Fat Cat was suggested by a colleague saying this is a good start for a beginner to fall in love with red wines, which is true. Looking forward to my next bottle of wine.'

A third said: 'Awesome red with a very high level of berries and it has very beautiful Barossa smell.'
