Real Madrid 'allowed James Rodriguez to join Everton for free' to get the Colombian off their wage bill - but they will take a chunk of any future sell-on fee.

The 29-year-old attacking midfielder completed his move from the Bernabeu to Goodison Park on Tuesday, signing a two-year contract with the option for a further season.

It sees Rodriguez link up with manager Carlo Ancelotti for the third time, having played under the Italian at both Real and Bayern Munich.

The transfer fee was understood to be around £20million but reports by fichajes.com, via Sport, suggest that actually Real allowed Rodriguez to depart for nothing.

The Spanish champions reportedly agreed to the deal in order to get his £140,000-a-week wages off the balance sheet and because he was out of contract next summer anyway. 

The same reports in Spain say, however, that Real would be due a percentage of any future sale should Rodriguez leave Goodison Park.

Real compromised on their original ambition to sell the player for a substantial transfer fee after realising there wasn't the market amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Having spent two seasons out on loan at Bayern Munich, the Colombian suffered an injury-disrupted 2019-20 campaign, playing just 14 times for Zinedine Zidane's team.

He has now become the headline signing of Everton's summer window as the Toffees aim to improve on their 12th place finish in last season's Premier League.

Ancelotti could hand Rodriguez, who has taken the No 19 shirt, his debut when Everton head to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday afternoon.
