Joe Root gave the England T20 selectors a nudge as he starred in Yorkshire’s Vitality Blast win over Derbyshire. 

The Test captain scored 64 off 40 balls — including two sixes and seven fours — then took two wickets with his spin. 

He is trying to make a case for inclusion in the T20 World Cup and must be putting Moeen Ali under pressure. 

This was his fifth career T20 50 as Yorkshire reached 220-5. Adam Lyth also smashing 61 from 32 deliveries, before the Falcons stumbled to 121-9 with Root taking a career-best 2-7.
