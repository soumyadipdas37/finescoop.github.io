Jose Mourinho was critical of his Tottenham side's 'lazy press' after a lethargic display in their 1-0 opening defeat against Everton.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the second-half winner for a new-look Everton side in a disappointing performance by Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Mourinho's side looked second best for much of the tie, lacking energy and a real goal threat as they struggled to conjure any clear-cut chances in their push for an equaliser.

And the boss admitted he felt players were not yet fully fit after a shorter-than-usual pre-season.

'Disappointed with the performance. In the first half we had the best chances apart from the Richarlison one, but in the second half after the goal we were not able to create and they dominated the game and were dangerous on the counter-attack,' The Portuguese told Sky Sports after the game.

'The struggle started in the way we press, or the way we didn't press. Our pressure was very, very poor. I would say it is lazy press. 

'They have players with incredible quality. When you let them play from the back they are comfortable to play the ball.

The Portuguese manager said his side's 'lazy press' allowed the Toffees to be comfortable

'Lazy pressure and that creates unbalanced situations for the rest of the team. I could also feel some of players are not fit. Matt (Doherty) was struggling to play the way he wants to play. 

'It has been a strange pre-season for some. But congratulations to my dear friend Carlo.

The manager will have been concerned by the players' seeming lack of fitness as they get set to play three more games in the next nine days, starting with a Europa League qualifier against Lokomotiv Plovdiv on Thursday.

Mourinho suggested some of his players were not fully fit following a shorter pre-season 

When asked how Mourinho help his players bounce back from the defeat, the 57-year-old replied: 'Being honest with them, telling them things I cannot say to you but I can say to them. On Thursday we have a knockout game so there is not much time to cry or to complain.'

After an uninspiring first half, Mourinho substituted Dele Alli for Moussa Sissoko in a bid to combat The Toffee's new-look midfield of Allan, Abdoulaye Doucoure and James Rodriguez, a change Mourinho confirmed was tactical.
