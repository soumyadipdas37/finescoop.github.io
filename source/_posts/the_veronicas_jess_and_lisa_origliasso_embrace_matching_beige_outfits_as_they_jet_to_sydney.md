Rumours are swirling The Veronicas' Jess and Lisa Origliasso will star on Channel Seven's new reboot of The Voice.

And on Thursday, the girls did little to dampen the speculation as they jetted to Sydney from Brisbane airport. 

The identical twins, 35, looked to be in high spirits as they wore beige-hued outfits for their stay in the Harbour City.

Lisa opted to wear a '90s style sunhat, which she paired with an over-sized jumper and a pair of thigh-high shorts. 

The Untouched singer paired the outfit with graphic socks and a pair of white lace-up sneakers. She carried a large coat. 

Meanwhile, Jessica wore a cropped, button-down shirt which she paired with beige shorts. She finished her outfit with socks and lace-up sneakers.

The singer carried her belongings in a blue-and-white stripe overnight bag.       

Not all viewers are thrilled about the idea of twins replacing the current coaches on the program.

Fans flocked to Facebook earlier this month to beg Seven to consider other local singers for the 2021 series.

Seven has confirmed that its version of The Voice will be a 'more efficient and cost-effective production' than the show produced by Nine.

As a result, it's believed next year's panel will not feature any international stars, and will instead consist solely of local musicians.  

When reports surfaced this month that Seven was potentially considering The Veronicas, longtime fans of the show were less than impressed.

'The Veronicas, seriously?' one furious viewer wrote, as others pleaded: 'Please not the Veronicas!'  

'It's gone from bad to worse,' one viewer said of the proposed changes, as others insisted they felt sorry for longtime judge Delta Goodrem.

Meanwhile, several commenters suggested there must be 'better options' available.
