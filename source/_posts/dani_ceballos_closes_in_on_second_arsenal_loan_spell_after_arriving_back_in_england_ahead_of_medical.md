Dani Ceballos has arrived in London ahead of a second loan spell with Arsenal this season.

The Spanish midfielder spent last season at the Emirates Stadium on a temporary deal but returned to Real Madrid after his Gunners contract expired after the FA Cup final victory over Chelsea.

Yet the 24-year-old impressed Mikel Arteta during the second-half of the season and has done enough to earn another short-term stint in north London.

According to Goal, the deal will see Arsenal cover the whole of Ceballos' wages in north London instead of paying a loan fee - while there is no obligation to buy clause at the 2020-21 season. 

The report also says the midfielder turned down several other offers in Europe to make an Arsenal return, with Ceballos strongly linked with a return to former side Real Betis. 

The 24-year-old made 36 appearances in all competitions for the Gunners last term, scoring two goals. He played a key role in helping Arsenal complete their 14th FA Cup triumph in their history by scoring a late winner in the quarter-final before starting both the semi-final and the final victories.

He was initially signed by former boss Unai Emery and started his Arsenal career brightly, but the Spanish coach's sacking and the arrival of Arteta saw him temporarily drop out of the side. 

But Ceballos started all but one of Arsenal's final 15 matches of the season with the last coming in the 2-1 cup final win over Chelsea at Wembley on August 1.  

Speaking at the start of pre-season, Arteta said: 'Dani knows really well what I think about him. He was pretty clear with me as well that his intention was to remain with us.

'He is a player we are interested in because we really saw in the last few months of the season what he is capable of bringing to us.' 

Ceballos may not be the only midfield arrival in north London this summer, with Arsenal strongly interested in signing Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey and Lyon star Houssem Aouar this summer. 

These potential arrivals could see midfield options head out of the Emirates exit door, with Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi just some players who could depart Arsenal this summer.
