Leeds are ready to return to LaLiga in this transfer window with manager Marcelo Bielsa reportedly targeting a move for Barcelona midfielder Rafinha.  

The newly-promoted side are targeting quality additions for their Premier League return in a bid to avoid an immediate drop to the Championship. 

Having already smashed their transfer record to get Rodrigo from Valencia for £35million, Sport report that the Yorkshire club now want Barcelona academy graduate Rafinha. 

Marcelo Bielsa is continuing to add to his Leeds squad ahead of their Premier League return

The 27-year-old, who spent season on loan at Celta Vigo, is valued at £14m by the Catalan side. 

Celta Vigo's hesitation on triggering that fee has opened the door for other suitors to move and Leeds are reportedly targeting a move to bring him to Elland Road to bolster their midfield on the eve of the 2020-21 campaign. 

Rafinha is the younger brother of Thiago Alcantara, who himself is attracting lots of interest from the Premier League after informing Bayern Munich of his desire to leave the club this summer. 

Bielsa has so far made two signings with £11.5m Freiburg defender Robin Koch joining Rodrigo in a move to England.
