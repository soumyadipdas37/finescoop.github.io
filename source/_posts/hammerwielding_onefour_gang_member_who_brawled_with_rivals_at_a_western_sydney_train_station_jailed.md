A hammer-wielding teen gangster jailed for fighting in front of frightened train passengers says the deaths of his grandmother and a friend sparked his spiral into crime.  

Frank Bosco, 18, was sentenced in Mount Druitt Local Court on Tuesday after pleading guilty but could be released from jail in January.

The OneFour gang member was caught brawling with rival Greater West and Inner West gangs at Rooty Hill train station in Sydney's west on June 12, the Blacktown Advocate reported.

Footage showed Bosco and other gang members arrive at the station armed with machetes, knives and hammers before confronting their rivals, who were on the train. 

The rival gangs began to fight in front of horrified commuters after Bosco brandished a 30cm hammer.

The brawl only ended when Inner West gang members re-boarded the train. 

The court was told a rivalry between the gangs started following the death of Inner West gang associate Tinorei Henri, 20, in 2018.

Magistrate Stephen Corry told Bosco it was lucky no one was killed during the violent attack, which sparked numerous triple zero calls. 

'This was something where you had gone to the station as a planned exercise armed with a weapon that could potentially cause lethal injury,' Magistrate Corry  said.

'This happened after 4pm on a weekday afternoon where you would expect there to be large numbers of members of the public going about their day.

'We've seen media reports recently about this sort of affair turning into a full-blown affray where someone ends up dead, which could've happened in this case.'

Bosco's lawyer told the court his offending was sparked by the death of his grandmother and a close friend after his high school exams.

The teenager also apologised for his actions, which he labelled selfish after putting fear into members of the public.

He said commuters should be able to get on the train without issues such as this 

Bosco pleaded guilty to affray, possessing unlawfully obtained goods and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence.

He was jailed for 14 months with a non-parole period of eight months.

Bosco could be out of jail by January due to time already served.
