The Flip or Flop host then explained, 'Taylor was supposed to go to Paris with Tarek’s mom and step dad - but because of circumstances we brought Paris to us.'

The accompanying series of photos showed a Paris-themed party setup, the centerpiece of which was a bakery named after the birthday girl.

And there was no shortage of French baked goods on display, including biscuits, Eiffel Tower designed cakes and pink Macaroons.

Christina recently unveiled the ninth season of her HGTV real estate show Flip Or Flop with ex Tarek El Moussa, to whom she was married from 2009 until 2018.

She and Tarek share daughter Taylor, nine, and son Brayden, five.

Ant, for his part, also has children from a previous marriage, to Louise Anstead - daughter Amelie, 19, and son Archie, 14.

The news of Ant and Christina's split comes after the British born Ant was recently able to fly home to be with his older children after a months-long delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier in lockdown, Ant had explained that due to flight cancellations he was unable to be with his two older children.

The doting dad was grateful for 'modern communications' and relied on daily FaceTime calls to bridge the gap between himself and his kids.

However, the separation wasn't easy and he lamented not being able to get his blended family all together. 'I am so over 2020 now!!!! This last week has been particularly TOUGH,' he wrote in June.

Clearly, the stresses of this year also took their toll on his relationship with his second wife, in spite of a cheery post in August celebrating their dating anniversary.

It remains to be seen whether Ant will stay across the pond, or return to co-parent his young son in Orange County, California with Christina.
