They rose to fame when appearing together on Love Island earlier this year. 

And bombshell twins Jess and Eve Gale, 21, commanded attention as they headed for a glamorous night out at Eight Members Club in London on Monday.  

The reality stars both put on a typically leggy display as they showed off their curves in skimpy outfits.

Jess opted for a figure-hugging white mini dress which she teamed with see-through heels and a Fendi purse.

Eve wore an over-sized white t-shirt, strappy heels and carried a blue Dior handbag over her shoulder. 

Both girls wore their blonde locks poker straight and opted for dewy, neutral-toned make-up as they hit the town.

Jess has been trying to move on since her split from Love Island beau Ched Uzor, 23, during the pandemic.  

It's been reported that lockdown made it impossible for the couple to 'build a relationship' as they were unable to meet up with one another.  

In a statement shared with MailOnline, the blonde beauty confirmed the COVID-19 lockdown played a role in the demise of their romance, but insisted they continue to be friends.

The statement read: 'After a whirlwind romance in the Love Island villa, unfortunately Jessica Gale and Ched Uzor have made the mutual decision to split.

'They have unfortunately felt the effects of lockdown separation but will continue as friends. 

'They wish nothing but the best for each other and full success in each others careers.'
