Fashion designer Pip Edwards boasts a social media following of more than 165,000 on Instagram.

And on Wednesday, the P.E Nation founder used her star power to shed light and help raise money for a child with rare type of cancer.

The 40-year-old shared a photo of the little girl with her family, along with the caption: 'My heart goes out to Lani Webb and her darling daughter Arlowe.'

She continued: 'Arlowe is 20-months-old and last week she was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer called Ewing Sarcoma.'

Ewing Sarcoma is a rare cancer that occurs most often in the bones of the trunk (pelvis, scapula, and ribs) or long bones, such as the femur, according to The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne.

At the end of her post, Pip urged her followers to: 'Help us raise money to help this beautiful little girl and her family.'

For a good cause: Pip also urged her fans to consider donating, adding 'no parent ever wants to go through this'

Pip, who shares son Justice, 13, with ex-partner Dan Single, urged her fans to consider donating, adding 'no parent ever wants to go through this.'

Pip is currently dating ex-cricketer Michael Clarke.     

Michael, 39, separated from wife Kyly Clarke, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.

Pip and Michael confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, while the pair enjoyed a Noosa holiday together. 

Michael is notoriously private, and while hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip, he did recently say that he couldn't be happier.  

Michael has one daughter, Kelsey Lee, four, with ex-wife Kyly.

She shared a photo of the finished meal to her Instagram stories, captioning it: 'Dinner for my man!'
