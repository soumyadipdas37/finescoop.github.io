Rhian's Curvy Kate swimwear showed off her amble assets as she posed for a sun-soaked selfie, while the bottoms accentuated her toned stomach.

The blonde beauty wore her golden tresses in a sleek, wet look, and she appeared to wear a light palette of make-up for the outing.

Clearly delighted to be enjoying her holiday, Rhian wrote in the caption: 'Can’t beat a sunset selfie!'

Earlier this month, Rhian revealed she put on a half a stone during lockdown but is embracing her new curves. 

She wrote on Instagram: 'Has anyone else packed on a few pounds in lockdown? I’ve put on over half a stone and can’t for the life of me get motivated to go to the gym.   

'But putting my gym gear on is a step in the right direction right?

'I wish I was one of those people that enjoys working out and running etc... I just like eating and laying down too much.'

The glamour model is married to former Coronation Street actor Oliver Mellor and the couple have been enduring gruelling IVF for 20 months.    

 After discovering that she wouldn’t be able to conceive naturally,  they went through two rounds of IVF and are planning their third.

Throughout the process, experts recommended she stopped using all cosmetic products that contain hash chemicals or additives, which is when she decided to go tan-free for over 12 months.
