French First Lady Brigitte Macron was pictured smiling brightly on Monday as she joined her husband Emmanuel during a visit to Lithuania. 

The 67-year-old and her 42-year-old husband were visiting Lithuania's president Gitanas Nauseda and his wife Diana Nausediene in the presidential palace in Vilnius.

Brigitte looked stylish in a matching blue coat and midi dress as she accepted a pen from her husband to sign the official visitor's book.

She then was pictured sitting at a prepared white and gold table to sign the book as Mr Nauseda and his wife, who also wore a blue dress, watched on and smiled.

Emmanuel later affectionately rested his hand on his wife's back as they posed for a picture. 

They then enjoyed a group photograph with their Lithuanian opposite numbers.  

None of the politicians were wearing masks in the palace but did do so when the French couple arrived for their visit.

The VIPs wore masks as they arrived at the presidential palace in Vilnius, the country's capital

The couples were flanked by mask-wearing guards as they lined up for photographs outside the palace

They travelled to Lithuania on board the French President's official plane and Brigitte arrived wearing a different outfit - a velvet purple coat and a black top and trousers. 

Later, at the presidential palace, they were given a guard of honour by soldiers dressed in ceremonial uniforms. 

As he emerged from his car, Emmanuel gave his Lithuanian counterparts a polite bow. 

The visit came two weeks after Brigitte revealed how she felt 'helpless and scared' after the birth of her first child.

She had three children with her first husband André-Louis Auzière after their wedding in 1974 and today she has seven grandchildren. 

Speaking to the French magazine Elle, Brigitte, who had her first child aged 21, admitted she felt 'helpless' when she left the maternity ward after giving birth.

Brigitte held her husband's hand firmly as they walked down- a prepared red carpet from the plane

She said she dreaded being responsible for this child, revealing: 'I was scared not to know [what to do], I was scared something would happen to him. He spent the three first weeks screaming night and day.'

She added: 'We never talk about how alone and helpless a young mother can be.

'At 21, right after the birth of my first child, I was standing in front of the hospital waiting for his father to take us home, and I wanted to make a U-turn and run to hide in the maternity ward.'

After the baby spent three weeks crying 'day and night', Brigitte phoned for a doctor who assured her the baby was fine.  

However, she later discovered her son Sébastien suffered from a medical problem which was solved with an operation.
