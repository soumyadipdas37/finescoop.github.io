Exhausted migrants today struggled ashore and collapsed on a Dover beach after eight dinghies dodged Border Force in a daring dash across the Channel on a record-breaking day which saw 409 migrants landing in the UK.

A total of 30 boats are believed to have made the crossing, the first setting off in the early hours of Wednesday, amid 'absolute mayhem' in the world's busiest shipping lane.

Astonishing photographs showed groups of migrants wading through the surf and staggering up the sand before collapsing on the rocks, exhausted after the perilous journey.

At least eight dinghies dodged Border Force boats to make it to the Kent coast unchecked. One woman was seen lying on concrete steps in sodden clothes complaining about stomach pains, while another was given a bottle of Coke for a sugar boost.

One of the group could be seen wringing out water from her clothes, while some helped each other walk along the beach and talked to Border Force officials who arrived on the scene before they could leave.

Other photographs showed the migrants sleeping on the sand and trying to get dry following the crossing, with most of them not wearing face masks despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Separate sets of pictures showed a family sitting on a bench after walking up a hill following their landing at St Margaret's at Cliffe near Dover, and groups of migrants being brought into the town's harbour by the Border Force.

Questions will be raised over how some of the groups of migrants successfully evaded Border Force boats before making it to the shore, and whether any of them then made it further inland without being caught. 

The arrivals along the coast mean today's crossings have shattered last month's single-day record of 235 migrants who arrived in 17 vessels. 

So far this year, at least 5,025 migrants have arrived in small boats - including a single-month record of 1,468 in August.

That figure does not include the 100-odd who made the trip on around 15 boats Tuesday. Official Home Office statistics are yet to be released for those crossings or the ones today.

One onlooker told MailOnline that he was at the beach with a group of other people when the migrants arrived and managed to convince them to avoid escaping. 

He said: 'We were there before the police. The lifeboat couldn't get in – it was too shallow. So if we weren't there, they were have run off and escaped. The Border Force arrived within 20 minutes - it's next to the dock.

'Some did try and make an escape but we managed to round them up and persuade them not to, because there's railway lines and roads nearby - so if you don't know the area you get killed instantly.'

Speaking about the blonde lady wearing trainers, he said: 'She was absolutely exhausted, she fell on the floor after getting there. She was given a bottle of Diet Coke and she perked up, but she was shivering to the bone.'

Referring to another woman who was lying on the steps, he added that she 'collapsed complaining of pains in her stomach, and they were trying to establish what it was' with an English-speaking member of the group. 

He said Coastguards, medics and Border Force officials were all at the scene following the arrival of the migrants on the two boats and 'have been run off their feet, big time'.

Speaking about the migrants, he said: 'They were all focused, they all got off the craft and you can see them falling over, because obviously it's low tide, and it's a bit of a further walk. They were just about to disperse.'

He also took a separate series of photographs of a family who landed at St Margaret's at Cliffe, saying they were caught at the top of the hill after climbing up from the beach and taken in by the Coastguard.

The rescue operation was going on since at least 6am. The Channel was calm and there were clear skies - making it easier to make the perilous journey across the world's busiest shipping lane, the Dover Strait. 

A separate set of photographs taken in another area of Dover this morning appeared to show more babies and children than usual among the latest migrants to arrive by dinghy today. 

The pictures showed at least five children being led or carried into the port by rescuers this morning after they made the dangerous journey into the UK aboard flimsy boats.

Some of the children - as young as a few months old - were not wearing lifejackets as they were led up the gangway, although they could have been already removed.

Others were being carried by officials, rather than their parents, after making the treacherous trip across the Channel. The youngest baby was carried onto shore by what appeared to be a Border Force official.

Another baby was strapped to a woman's front, and was wearing warm coats. A couple with two small boys were photographed being escorted up the gangway, and 14 boats were pictured tied to the side of the port. 

At least 100 people were brought into Dover today, packed on Border Force patrol vessels and sitting on lifeboats. Some smiled and waved as they arrived into the busy port while others carried toddlers too young to walk. 

Lashing winds and choppy seas brought on by Storm Francis at the end of August made crossings impossible for several days, but conditions have improved in the first two days of September.

Today has seen bright sunshine and winds under 5mph in Kent, with temperatures expected to reach 18C (64F). The Home Office has yet to confirm how many migrants successfully crossed to the UK yesterday.

Immigration officials at the port of Dover were busy this morning, with dozens of migrants waiting aboard Border Force vessels and lifeboats in the harbour. Among their numbers were adults carrying young children.

After waiting to be brought ashore - some for about an hour - the migrants were led up the gangway towards the Border Force processing centre. Once ashore, they will be assessed for symptoms of coronavirus, as is protocol.

Several empty dinghies with outboard motors attached were also seen being towed into the port throughout the morning. French marine patrol boats remain active on the other side of the Channel.

In the House of Commons today, Boris Johnson claimed Britain is a 'target and magnet' for people traffickers as he pledged to make changes to the law. 

Conservative Lee Anderson (Ashfield) told the Prime Minister the asylum system is 'broken and being abused', to which Mr Johnson replied in the Commons: 'I have a great deal of sympathy with those who are so desperate as to put their children in dinghies or even children's paddling pools and try to cross the Channel.

'But I have to say what they're doing is falling prey to criminal gangs and they are breaking the law. They're also undermining the legitimate claims of others who would seek asylum in this country.

'That is why we will take advantage of leaving the EU by changing the Dublin regulations on returns and we will address the rigidities in our laws that makes this country, I'm afraid, a target and a magnet for those who would exploit vulnerable people in this way.'

Home Office minister Chris Philp said 24 people have been jailed for facilitating illegal immigration so far this year.

Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, he said: 'The majority of these crossings are facilitated by ruthless criminal gangs who make money from exploiting migrants who are desperate to come here.

'We're working with the National Crime Agency to go after those who profit from such misery. Already this year 24 people have been convicted and jailed for facilitating illegal immigration.' 

Mr Philp said 34 people who attempted to cross the Channel today were picked up by the RNLI. He said the French authorities also stopped 84 migrants from making the journey on the French side today and over 3,000 crossing attempts have been stopped this year.

He also added that the UK is working to return around 1,000 people who have illegally entered the UK after already having claimed asylum in another country.

Mr Philp highlighted the dangers of small boats crossing the Channel after a Sudanese migrant died attempting to get to the UK.

He told the Commons: 'In recent months the UK has seen a completely unacceptable increase in illegal migration through small boat crossings from France to the UK.

'This Government and the Home Secretary are working relentlessly to stop these crossings.'

He added: 'These crossings are highly dangerous. Tragically last month a 28-year-old old Sudanese man, Abdulfatah Hamdallah, died in the water near Calais attempting this crossing.'

A record number of migrants reached Britain by illegally crossing the Channel last month, it has been confirmed.

More than 1,450 arrived by small boats in August, bringing the total since the start of the year to more than 5,000. Just 1,850 migrants made the journey in 2019.

The massive rise comes despite a vow from Home Secretary Priti Patel last autumn to have made the crossings an ‘infrequent phenomenon’ by this point.

The Home Office has sought to blame French authorities and ‘activist lawyers’ for the increase and for difficulties removing asylum seekers once they arrive in Britain.

About 100 migrants were seen arriving in the port of Dover yesterday, with at least 15 small boats reaching British shores.

The daily total included women and children, as well as three men on an inflatable kayak.

One woman in her 20s was seen being brought ashore by Border Force officers in a wheelchair.

Others were brought into Dover aboard the UK Border Force patrol boat Hunter. They were seen being ushered out of the cabin on to the stern of the vessel where they were given life jackets.

Immigration officials then helped them ashore one by one and escorted them up the gangway.

A dinghy believed to have been used to cross the Channel was seen being towed into the harbour shortly afterwards.

Later, more arrivals believed to be migrants were seen coming into the port, sitting on the front of an RNLI lifeboat.

About a dozen in life jackets were helped ashore, where they were met by border officials.

The previous monthly record for migrant arrivals was 1,075, set in July. August’s arrivals saw 235 reach Britain on just one day – which was also a record.

Miss Patel is seeking a deal with French authorities that would allow migrant boats to be turned back in the Channel. No agreement has yet been reached.

Yesterday, the Mail revealed the taxpayer was hit with a £1billion bill for the asylum system last year.

Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: 'Isn't the truth that the Government's approach to this whole issue has frankly been defined by a lack of compassion and a lack of competence.'

He queried why work last year had 'proved so inadequate', asking when the joint action plan would be available for scrutiny.

He said: 'The Government was warned including by the Foreign Affairs select committee that the collapse of safe routes would lead to growing numbers of people taking to the sea.'

He added: 'The expectation around the Dubs amendment across the House was that 3,000 children would be accepted under the scheme. Does the minister now agree it was a profound error and frankly lacking in compassion to close down that scheme when only a 10th of that number had been accepted?'

Mr Thomas-Symonds also asked: 'What safeguards are being put in place to ensure that all accommodation is kept safe and Covid secure as well as protected from far-right attacks which have unfortunately been reported in recent days?'

He added: 'What we need now are solutions, not empty headlines trying to sound tough and I have deep concerns that the Government in recent weeks through talking of deploying the Navy and the RAF have tried to militarise a solution where lives are at risk.

'Ultimately the sad truth is that people are fleeing their homes as a result of poverty, war and persecution. So does the minister accept that abolishing the Department for International Development is a great mistake?'

Responding, Mr Philp said: 'This Government has provided almost 20,000 resettlement places since 2015, a number dwarfing the 3,000 mentioned. Since 2010, 44,000 children have been offered protection by the UK of one form or another.'

He added: 'This Government certainly needs no lessons in compassion, our asylum system is extremely compassionate, extremely generous and those numbers speak for themselves.'

Conservative MP Aaron Bell, for Newcastle-under-Lyme, said that 'asylum shopping' must end.

He said: 'Does (Chris Philp) agree that what's happening at the moment is essentially a form of asylum shopping where people claim asylum in the first country they reach and then they move to another and claim asylum again?

'They keep claiming asylum instead of securing the first safe country, they keep coming to the UK where they believe we have a more favourable asylum system. Asylum shopping needs to end, does he agree with that?'

Mr Philp responded: '(Mr Bell) is absolutely right - people who are genuinely seeking a safe refuge could and should claim that refuge in the first country they reach.'

Chris Philp said he 'wholeheartedly' condemns violent far-right groups who are targeting those who arrive in the UK having crossed the Channel.

Labour MP Rosie Duffield, for Canterbury, said: 'Given the recent, very violent assault on a young man who had just landed on a Kent beach, and the planned protest by far-right groups in Kent as reported in several broadsheet newspapers, what extra support is (Home Secretary Priti Patel) offering policing in Kent to ensure the safety of all those who seek asylum in our country?

'And will (Mr Philp) join me in telling those hate-driven violent groups that make their way to Kent to come back to where they come from?'

Mr Philp responded: 'Yes I will join her in condemning wholeheartedly and unreservedly the groups she's describing who have targeted migrants in this way.

'There is no excuse at all under any circumstances for harassing people who have arrived whatever someone's views may be about the immigration system.

'There is no excuse, no justification. The police have our full support in dealing with anyone who perpetrates violent offences or indeed harassment offences of the kind she described.'

The Coastguard said it had been 'assisting Border Force with incidents off Dover' today, with a spokesman adding: 'HM Coastguard is committed to safeguarding life around the seas and coastal areas of this country.

'We are only concerned with preservation of life, rescuing those in trouble and bringing them safely back to shore, where they will be handed over to the relevant partner emergency services or authorities.'  

Meanwhile, French authorities picked up 13 migrants in three separate incidents yesterday, which included two people on a kayak who were spotted in difficulty by a ferry two miles east of Calais. 

A record number of migrants reached Britain by illegally crossing the Channel last month. More than 1,450 arrived by small boats in August, bringing the total since the start of the year to more than 5,000.
