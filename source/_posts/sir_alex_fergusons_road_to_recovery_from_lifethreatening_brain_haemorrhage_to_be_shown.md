Sir Alex Ferguson's recovery from a life-threatening brain haemorrhage will be shown in a new documentary set to be released next year.

The Manchester United legend retired as Red Devils boss in May 2013 after 27 years at the helm having won 38 trophies including two Champions League titles.

The film shows Sir Alex, 78, dealing with the threat of memory loss with the love and support of his wife Cathy and his family.

Cameras followed Ferguson's road to recovery following his brush with death.

The former United and Aberdeen coach was rushed to hospital in May 2018 after falling ill at home.

He had emergency treatment on a brain haemorrhage and spent several days in intensive care at Salford Royal Hospital, near Manchester. 

The documentary has been directed by his son, Jason and will be shown in cinemas in 2021.

It began as a tribute to the extraordinary career of the man considered one of the great football managers of all time.

But he took ill just as filming began and it was decided to include his battle to recover. 

It will feature interviews with former players who worked under Ferguson including Gordon Strachan, Eric Cantona and Ryan Giggs.

Last year Ferguson raised £400,000 for the NHS as a thank you for the care he received during his health scare.

Speaking to film industry website Screen Daily, producer John Battsek told the Mirror: 'A layer of the film is Sir Alex in recovery, grappling with the threat of the loss of his memory, that being the memory of the greatest football manager that ever lived. 

'It's Sir Alex's real-life story from growing up in Govan in Glasgow, his career as a footballer and as a football manager to his battle recovering from the brain haemorrhage.

'It is a father-son story and a love story - the story of him and his amazing wife.

'Jason had already recorded 50 hours of audio with his dad and his father trusted him, really trusted him.

'We felt that if we surrounded Jason with all sorts of experienced hands, he could handle it. He has done a phenomenal job.'
