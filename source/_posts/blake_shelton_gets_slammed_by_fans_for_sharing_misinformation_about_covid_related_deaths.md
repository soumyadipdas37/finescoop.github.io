Blake Shelton was slammed by fans on Twitter after he shared a false claim relating to coronavirus deaths on Sunday. 

The debunked claim asserted that only 6% of the 183k COVID-19 related deaths in the US were caused by the virus. 

Shelton's tweet came after Twitter took down a post by President Donald Trump sharing the 'baseless QAnon conspiracy theory,' CNN reported.

'I’m not even sure which side(politically) this would land on,' he wrote. 'But am I the only person who sees the new CDC update as some actual good news?'  

In the true latest CDC report it noted that for 6% of victims 'Covid-19 was the only cause mentioned' while the other 94% of victims also suffered from a pre-existing condition. 

Pre-existing conditions can include obesity, diabetes, asthma, heart disease, among others that can also make a person high-risk for the virus, but that condition does not mean COVID didn't play a major role in their death.  

Shelton added: '[It's] just updated info that’s better than we thought. I mean does everything have to be a fight these days?'

Clarified, false: After being questioned by fans on what exactly he was referring to, the country singer clarified he was in fact referring to the false 6% claim. 'Sorry I should’ve been more clear. I’m talking about 6% news,' he tweeted. 'Again I’m not looking for an argument from either side. I just see it as some better news is all'

Fans and followers were quick to try and correct The Voice coach.  

'Do some actual research, Blake,' one wrote. 'A majority of the damn country has pre-existing health conditions. A lot don’t even know they have them.' 

Missed the point: Fans and followers were quick to try and correct The Voice coach. 'Do some actual research, Blake,' one wrote. 'A majority of the damn country has pre-existing health conditions. A lot don’t even know they have them.' Shelton did not respond to the correction 

Twitter fight: In a separate tweet, he continued: 'Whew... I can see that there’s no way a fight won’t erupt about this stuff. No matter how you slice it. And that’s last thing I wanted. Stay healthy and safe everyone' 

The fan added: 'So, if they contract COVID, it’s okay because those without will probably live? If you don’t understand the info, just don’t say anything.' 

Though, in his response, the singer seemed to ignore the correction the fan was trying to make instead choosing to take the comment as argumentative. 

'This is what I’m talking about,' he wrote. 'I’m not going to argue at all because I’m not advocating for anything. What is the fight? Covid is horrifying. That’s it.' 

In a separate tweet, he continued: 'Whew... I can see that there’s no way a fight won’t erupt about this stuff. No matter how you slice it. And that’s last thing I wanted. Stay healthy and safe everyone.'

A QAnon user started sharing the false claim misrepresenting the new CDC report and falsely asserting the other 94% of deaths weren't COVID related. QAnon is a far-right conspiracy group. 

The CDC recently projected that the United States will reach 200,000 deaths by the middle of September, as the country reaches 6m cases. 

The U.S. remains as the country with the most confirmed cases of the virus and the most deaths.  

Earlier this year, Shelton postponed dates of his Friends and Heroes Tour due to the pandemic and has since hosted a drive-in concert using pre-recorded footage.
