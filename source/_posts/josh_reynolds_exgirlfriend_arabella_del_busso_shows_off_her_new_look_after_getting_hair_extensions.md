She's no stranger to changing up her look.

And on Wednesday, NRL star Josh Reynolds' ex-girlfriend Arabella Del Busso showed off her latest transformation after getting new hair extensions.

The 30-year-old model shared a photo to Instagram, after visiting Sake Hair Studio in Melbourne.

Arabella wore a full face of makeup for the picture, including foundation, rosy blush, and black eyeliner.

'Thank you Sake Hair Studio for the amazing weft extensions... they are safe for your natural hair and are applied without heat,' she wrote.

She explained: 'They last up to around 6-8 weeks... and they've given myself just that extra bit of thickness and length.'

Arabella's post comes after it was announced she'll be appearing on Channel Seven's upcoming series SAS Australia.

The military-style show will see the contestants having to endure sleep deprivation, interrogation techniques and physical challenges.

The lingerie model will be joined by a growing list of celebrities including convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby and publicist Roxy Jacenko.

Filming for SAS Australia begun earlier this year in Queenstown, New Zealand, but production was relocated to the NSW Snowy Mountains due to travel restrictions being enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Arabella last appeared on television in May, when she addressed her bitter split with Josh on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes.

During the interview, Arabella tearfully denied faking pregnancies and miscarriages during her tumultuous relationship with the footy star.

However, she did admit to passing off another woman's ultrasound scan as her own in order to 'spite' her then-boyfriend.
