On Monday, creator Mike Flanagan gave fans of The Haunting of Hill House their first glimpse at his horror anthology follow-up, The Haunting of Bly Manor, which starts streaming October 9 on Netflix.

The nine-episode supernatural series - set in 1987 England - centers on American governess Dani Clayton (Victoria Pedretti), who's hired to tutor and care for orphaned children Miles & Flora Wingrave in a remote country house.

In the minute-long trailer, Dani checked out the creepy antique dolls mysteriously discarded in the basement of Bly Manor.

After leaving and turning out the lights, one of the dolls lifted its head.

Later, 11-year-old Flora (Amelie Bea Smith) sings a lullaby as a blurred figure behind her gasps for breath with bones cracking like a contortionist.

Unbothered, little Flora hushes the ghost.

'Dolls, for children, are a way to play with representations of real people,' Flanagan explained to Vanity Fair last week.

'I think for kids, it's about control. Kids have such little agency. Dolls provide that. But there's also a darker side to it. Ownership, claiming someone, ceasing to look at them as a human, and instead, looking at them as an object, as a doll.'

The Massachusetts-born 42-year-old cryptically added: 'The more attention a viewer focuses on Flora's dollhouse, the more they're likely to see what's happening and why.'

The teaser also reveals a female ghost rising from a pond in the ensemble drama loosely based on Henry James' 1898 horror novella, The Turn of the Screw.

E.T. alum Henry Thomas portrays the children's emotionally-distant uncle Henry Wingrave and there's also chef Owen (Rahul Kohli), groundskeeper Jamie (Amelia Eve), and housekeeper Mrs. Grose (T'Nia Miller) populating the estate.
