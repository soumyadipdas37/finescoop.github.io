A California activist who slammed the two Compton deputies shot on Saturday as 'two of America’s most notorious gang members' and 'murderers' is a part of a group that met with the Los Angeles Mayor’s office about 'cultural competency'.

On Saturday a 31-year-old and 24-year-old deputy were shot while sitting in their patrol car at the Metro Blue Line station around 7pm by an assailant who opened fire through the passenger side window.

Both underwent surgery and are in stable condition at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, DailyMail.com has revealed.

Kevin Wharton Price of the Africa Town Coalition shared video from outside the hospital with a few protesters on Sunday in which he refers to the injured deputies as 'American’s most notorious gang members'.

He's also referred to the shooting as the 'start of retribution', calling it a 'good thing'.  

Kevin Wharton Price of the Africa Town Coalition has slammed the two Compton deputies shot over the weekend as 'two of America’s most notorious gang members' and called the attack against them the start of 'retribution' for police brutality against black people

Price visited St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, where the two deputies are being treated, but was blocked by officers. In the clip Price said: 'We’re going to go up here and just check on these murderers right here and see what’s up'

Over the weekend protesters have gathered outside of the hospital and some were heard chanting, 'We hope they die'.

Price shared video going to the hospital with a few others in tow where he called the deputies 'murderers'. 

'We’re going to go up here and just check on these murderers right here and see what’s up,' he said in the clip, but officers refused to let them on the property saying the hospital is private and there’s no visitation allowed. 

In one clip shared on social media after the shooting Price said: 'I’ve been depressed but this right here has lightened my heart because the sheriff’s department has murdered too many of our brothers and sisters…So if this is a start of retribution, then I think it’s a very good start.'

'And for those who may not like the tone or how I come off...I get tired of seeing mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers sad as f*** because their family member has been dead, murdered by law enforcement,' he added. 

Price along with the Africa Town Coalition met with Mayor Eric Garcetti several times to discuss the creation of a 'cultural competency' workshop for business owners in Los Angeles areas earlier this year

Price leads the grass roots activist group Africa Town Coalition and is considered a leader in the Los Angeles activism community 

According to the Los Angeles Times Price along with the Africa Town Coalition met with Mayor Eric Garcetti several times to discuss the creation of a 'cultural competency' workshop for business owners in Los Angeles areas to teach them communication skills and historical context for specific communities. 

The effort was in response to a 2017 dispute at a Korean liquor store where a Korean stock boy wielded a stick at a black patron and accusations arose that the store mistreated the surrounding African American community.

Months-long boycotts and protested unfolded in the Leimert Park neighborhood afterwards.

They met several times but the effort fizzled out and community groups moved on to other issues, according to the February report. 

DailyMail.com has reached out to the Mayor's office for comment. 

 FOX11 obtained a photo (above) of the female deputy, who was described as a 31-year-old mother of a six-year-old boy, covered in blood after she was shot in the jaw helping her colleague in the Saturday shooting

Price spoke out on Monday in a video shared on social media saying reports that Black Lives Matter were trying to fight their way into the hospital were false.

'We did not go to force our way anywhere. We went to deliver a message to this gang-banging sheriff’s department that we’re not going to shed a tear because two gang-banging sheriff’s [deputies] got shot in the head. We’re not gonna shed no tears,' he said. 

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s department has shared video of the Saturday shooting an unknown person opening fire into the car 'without warning or provocation'. 

Claudia Apolinar, 31, was identified as one of the gunned down officers. She is a mother and she, along with the 24-year-old officer, graduated from the Los Angeles Police Academy last year.

Claudia and her 24-year-old male colleague were sitting in their patrol vehicle when a man ambushed them and shot them at point blank range on Saturday night.

Despite taking multiple bullets – one to the face and several to her upper torso – Claudia managed to get her partner to safety, apply a tourniquet and radio for help.

A photo of the aftermath of the attack shows the mother of a six-year-old child covered in blood, giving medical help to her injured partner.

The LA Sheriff’s Department is offering $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of the shooter, who is still at large. 

The ambush may have been a revenge attack against officers for recent police shootings against black men in LA, according to one report.  

Fox News reporter William la Jeunesse said Monday: 'Los Angeles police will not say this publicly - but some believe this ambush was retaliation for some recent police shootings of black suspects in LA.'
