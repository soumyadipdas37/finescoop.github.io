Stunned: It earned a thunderous response from fans who praised the group and BGT bosses for depicting the issue

Simon was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. 

The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest. 

Asked ahead of the show's semi-finals whether he worried the 2020 series was a right off, he said: 'Yeah, for a moment! But then I thought, "Where there’s a will, there’s a way!"

'I just thought that if we can talk to each other all over the world on something like Zoom then there must be a way for us to do the live shows.'

Filling in: Judge Ashley has stepped in for Simon Cowell on the BGT semi-finals after he was forced to miss the semi-finals due to a back injury

Simon underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles earlier this month, and has been recovering after having a metal rod installed in his back. 

This year marks the first time in BGT history that the semi-finals have been pre-recorded, and has also seen changes to the way acts will advance to the final. 

Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.

With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences' reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.  

The series will then culminate with the live final, in October, where one act will triumph as Britain’s Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.

Britain's Got Talent continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.
