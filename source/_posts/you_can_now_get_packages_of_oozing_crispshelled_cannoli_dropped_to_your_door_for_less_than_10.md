Customers across Sydney can now order delicious cannolis to be delivered to their doorstep for only $9.90 between Wednesday and Sunday.

Brothers Matt and Jordan Marchetta started the online patisserie business Cannoli Rush in February 2020 with the aim to tap into their family's 35-year history of making and selling Italian cakes.

The traditional dessert originates from Sicily in Italy and has a hollow tube-shaped pastry shell that's filled with cream or ricotta.

But the brothers have 'refined the recipe to perfection' and have experimented with a range of different flavours.

Some of the 15 unique flavours include cookies and cream, coffee, Kinder Bueno and the new Biscoff cannoli.

'Our head chef has actually been producing some of Sydney's finest cakes and pastries for over 35 years,' the business said online.

'Fast forward to today and our cannoli is loved so much that production is bigger than ever while still being handmade!'

The brothers pride themselves in making high quality cannolis from the freshest ingredients for their customers to order and enjoy.

The small cannolis are priced at $2.70 while the large cannolis are priced at $4.50 each.

For Father's Day the business is offering $99 gift boxes including eight different cannolis, assorted sweets and a 500mL bottle of Jack Daniels.

Alternatively the same box can be purchased for $69 without the alcohol, or other cannoli boxes are also available starting at $53 each. 

Customers can place their orders on the Cannoli Rush website.
