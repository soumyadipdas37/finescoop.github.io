She has garnered attention in recent years for her incredibly-toned physique and sense of style. 

And Melanie Sykes looked effortlessly chic as she departed the BBC Radio 2 studios in London on Saturday after presenting her radio show with Alan Carr.  

The radio presenter, 50, caught the eye in a 70s inspired outfit as she strutted towards her taxi and headed home.

She tucked her denim shirt into her black straight-leg trousers which cut the perfect silhouette for her slender frame. 

Mel added a retro touch with her blue-tinted aviator shades and accessorised the look with a black satchel bag and suede ankle boots. 

The mother-of-two parted her chocolate tresses down the centre and opted for a natural makeup look.

Her recent appearance comes after Mel hit out at Keith Lemon as she criticised British men who try to emulate him with their 'limited vocabulary.'

Earlier this month, the presenter discussed her dating experiences and branded men as 'pretty basic and disappointing,' during an interview for her own Frank magazine.

She said: 'Sadly, in all realms of life, most men are pretty basic and disappointing.

'I feel a bit sorry for British men who have adopted the limited vocabulary of the television character Keith Lemon when talking about and to women.

'I would be surprised, and indeed it would be a miracle, if any of these men are actually getting laid.'  

Mel has previously appeared on Celebrity Juice where comedian Leigh Francis takes on the persona of host Keith.

In light of her comments, Keith told The Sun he contacted Mel, who said she was merely referencing the persona he portrays on screen. 

He said: 'I reached out to her and asked why she didn’t like me. She said, "It’s not you, it’s your on-screen persona."

The star then noted some of his career achievements over the years as he defended himself.

Keith added: 'Well if anyone’s watching and you have a limited vocabulary, you can still win two Baftas and two NTAs. I don’t want to boast about all the things I’ve won.'
