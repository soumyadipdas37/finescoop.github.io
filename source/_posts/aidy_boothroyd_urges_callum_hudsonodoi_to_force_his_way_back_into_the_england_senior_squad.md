Aidy Boothroyd urged Callum Hudson-Odoi to force a way back into Gareth Southgate’s squad by dazzling for England Under 21s. 

Hudson-Odoi was part of the senior set-up at the previous camp in November, starting a 4-0 win in Kosovo but has now returned to the junior level.

Boothroyd praised the Chelsea winger’s attitude after a conversation on arrival at St Georges’ Park on Monday, ahead of two European Championship qualifiers against Kosovo and Austria, starting on Friday.

‘He’s very positive, he knows what he has to do to get to the seniors, what he has to work on in his game,’ said the Under 21 manager.

‘It’s over to him now to show what he’s all about, to show the qualities that got him into the senior team and Chelsea’s team in the first place.

‘It’s not a straight road for young players when they burst on to the scene. It’s more like a country road. You never know what’s round the corner.

‘That’s why we have this level because it is a feeder and players have to gain experiences before they are ready for the seniors.’

 England Women will travel to play Germany on October 27 in their first match since March. The teams met last November in front of a record 77,768 fans but this one will be behind closed doors.
