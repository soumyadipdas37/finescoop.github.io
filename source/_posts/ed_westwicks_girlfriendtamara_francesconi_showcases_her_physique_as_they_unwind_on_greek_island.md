They've enjoyed a summer exploring some of Europe's most beautiful destinations.

And Ed Westwick's girlfriend Tamara Francesconi showcased her toned physique in stylish beachwear from PrettyLittleThing as the couple unwound on an idyllic Greek Island, on Monday. 

The Gossip girl actor, 33, and his model girlfriend, 23, have been staying at Calilo, a 5 star resort located at Papas Beach on the island of Ios, in Greece, and looked lost in paradise as they swam together in the torquoise waters.

Tamara teamed her mishmashed swimwear set with a lilac shirt and coordinating fedora, while accessorising with a smattering of gold jewellery.  

The raven haired beauty styled her long locks sleek and straight and enhanced her natural beauty with a heavy make-up look for the snap. 

In her couples shot, Tamara couple be seen with her legs outstretched as she swam towards Ed, in a post which she captioned: 'She would be half a world away, floating in a turquoise sea, dancing by moonlight.'

Their latest getaway comes after Ed was seen joking around with his girlfriend as he pretended to propose while they spent the day together in Lake Como

The actor was seen getting down on one knee while he and the model waited for his mum to join them, but Tamara was none too pleased by the act. 

Tamara looked at Ed with a displeased expression as he held his hands to her as if he was holding a ring, before he stood up and expressed his disappointment at being rebuffed by her.

Fun in the sun: Tamara - who boasts 206k Instagram followers - has been keeping her fans up to date with her recent travels, posting smouldering shots and cosy selfies with Ed

Ed went public with Tamara during a Los Angeles outing in October, after insiders claimed the couple had been dating for weeks.

A source told The Sun that Tamara is a hit with Ed's close-knit family: 'Tamara's head over heels with him and Ed is proud to tell everyone Tamara is his girlfriend,' the insider claimed.

'His friends and family all approve and think they're a great match.'
