In a twist, it seems that this pair of lovebirds' respective exes have shacked up themselves.

But Ashley Benson and beau G-Eazy didn't look bothered in the slightest on Wednesday, when the pair were seen loving it up outside a Kreation Organic Juicery with cold drinks in Los Angeles, California.

Pretty Little Liars star Benson, 30, had her man's arm around her as they held on to their beverages, both wearing face masks as a measure of protection against the still-prevalent coronavirus pandemic.

Ashley stepped out in a vintage black Romeo + Juliet t-shirt featuring the visage of Leonardo DiCaprio set against a floral motif.

She paired this with black leggings, and worn-looking sneakers.  

The actress and ex of Cara Delevingne had her blond hair in a half bun, and she wore yellow sunshades.

Boyfriend G-Eazy, 31, matched her in head-to-toe black Nike sportswear, complete with tee, shorts, baseball cap and ankle socks.

His sneakers also looked well-worn.

And while the rapper's face covering was black as well, Ashley's was white.

The sighting of the loved-up duo comes after reports that 28-year-old Cara, who split from Ash back in April, has started seeing G's former flame Halsey.

According to The Sun, Cara - who currently resides in Los Angeles - has been enjoying a new romance with singer and budding actress Halsey, 25, after separating from Benson.

The new coupling comes just three months after Ashley and G-Eazy got together themselves.

While Cara and Ashley were together for nearly two years before splitting this spring, G-Eazy and Halsey split back in 2018, after shacking up in August of the year prior.

The pair reportedly connected romantically whilst working on their duet Him And I. 

They separated following speculation that he had cheated on her, and the former couple have continued to throw jabs at each other through their music.

Following his split from Halsey, the I Mean It rapper was previously linked to Yasmin Wijnaldum and Megan Thee Stallion before he was spotted out with Ashley, just weeks after her breakup from Cara.
