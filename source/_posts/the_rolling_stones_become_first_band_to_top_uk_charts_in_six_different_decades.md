The Rolling Stones have become the first band to top UK charts in six different decades after scoring a Number 1 with revamped Goat's Head Soup album. 

The band, who first began performing in 1962, went straight to the top spot on Friday with a remastered version of the album, which was originally released in 1973. 

They beat Declan McKenna by just over 800 sales and the rest of the top five spots were claimed by Pop Smoke, Nines and Taylor Swift.

The Rolling Stones still regularly tour despite their members such as singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards being well into their seventies. 

They have now scored 13 UK chart-topping albums, the same number as Elvis Presley and Robbie Williams, the Official Charts Company said.

And only The Beatles have managed more with 15.

It comes after Mick Jagger (pictured) addressed the possibility of the group recording new music amid the coronavirus pandemic

It comes after Mick Jagger addressed the possibility of the group recording new music amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking to NME, he said: 'I don't know when we're gonna get together at the moment.

'We don't know when we're going to get together and record. It's got to be in safe circumstances and all that stuff.'
