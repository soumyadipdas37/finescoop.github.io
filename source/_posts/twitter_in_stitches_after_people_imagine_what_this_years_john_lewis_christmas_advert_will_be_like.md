Each year, the John Lewis Christmas advert is eagerly awaited and brings a dose of feel-good festive cheer.

However, after months of working from home and socially distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and with new restrictions on the way, it is possible this year's offering might be decidedly more austere.  

London-based journalist Jonathan Dean asked people to share their best ideas about what it might feature, down to the soundtrack, in a hilarious Twitter thread. 

After people chipped in with their own suggestions, the official Twitter account for John Lewis and Partners got in on the joke, saying they were taking notes. 

Each year, the John Lewis Christmas advert is eagerly awaited and brings a dose of feel-good festive cheer (pictured, last year's characters). But this year could be decidedly more austere 

London-based journalist Jonathan Dean started a thread asking people what they thought this year's John Lewis and Partners' Christmas ad would look like

Jonathan started the thread, writing: 'Dreading the John Lewis Christmas advert this year. Probably a cover of Fix You by a children’s choir, singing to all their nans via Zoom. Any other thoughts.'  

Like Jonathan, many suggested the video conference system Zoom, which was popular throughout the strict lockdown put in place in March, should appear in the commercial. 

Captain Tom Moore, who raised  £32,79 million for the NHS in the run up to his 100th birthday, was also named by some to be the hero of their imagined advert or making an appearance. 

One person also mentioned Marcus Rashford's campaign with Fareshare to raise £20 million to provide food for children that would have received free meals if still at school.
