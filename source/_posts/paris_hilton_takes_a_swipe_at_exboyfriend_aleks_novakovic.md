Paris Hilton has taken a swipe at her ex-boyfriend Aleks Novakovic in an Australian radio interview.

Her turbulent relationship with the former pro soccer player was featured in her new YouTube documentary, This Is Paris. 

On Tuesday's episode of The Kyle and Jackie O Show, the 39-year-old star issues a scathing retort when asked about Aleks.

Hitting back! Paris Hilton took a swipe at her ex-boyfriend Aleks Novakovic this week, implying that he's not worthy enough to be given the title of being one of her ex-boyfriends 

'He's not an ex by the way,' she sniffed. 'Don't even give him that title!' 

Paris and Aleks clashed in an explosive fight that was featured in her new documentary.

And the documentary's director Alexandra Dean revealed last week that the heiress wanted the footage removed altogether.

'You could see [Novakovic] really pushes her to the edge and Paris really puts down a boundary for the first time,' Alexandra told Too Fab.

In the exchange, which took place at EDM festival Tomorrowland, the socialite, 39, and Aleks butted heads just prior to her set.

After he griped to the Stars Are Blind singer that she'd repeatedly left him by himself at the event, she lost her patience after he carelessly dropped a computer of her's that was essential to her performance.

'You can't just drop a computer before a set!' she snapped. 'The computer could break. Will someone who's not gonna drop it, take it?'

Paris was especially upset with the timing of her beau's outburst, asking others to keep him at a distance as she mentally readied herself for the set in front of 80,000 festival attendees.

'Can you tell him to chill the f*** out?' she said. 'This is f***ed up. I'm playing Tomorrowland. He needs to chill the f*** out. I'm sick of this s***. I'm playing in six minutes.'

'You can't just drop a computer before a set!' she snapped. 'The computer could break. Will someone who's not gonna drop it, take it?'

She said that Aleks was 'so insecure,' eventually removing his access bracelet from his wrist and having venue security throw him out of the area.

The director said of the fight, 'I think everyone feels what I feel watching it, which is, yeah, finally, put down a boundary, be yourself. Respect your own boundaries, you know?'

'She clearly isn't doing that for any cameras, she's really struggling and she's letting that struggle unfold on camera. That was when we had been filming for a really long time and the cameras had become invisible.'
