She's gearing up for the release of her latest album, Disco, on November 6.

And Kylie Minogue enjoyed some downtime before her promotional trail for her LP as she stepped out for a stroll in London on Tuesday.

The award-winning singer, 52, cut an uncharacteristically casual figure in a black baseball cap, pink-tinted glasses and a £30 face mask by Christopher Kane for her walk.

Maintaining her low-key appearance, the Spinning Around hitmaker covered up in a stone-coloured raincoat, which worked well with her grey T-shirt and matching yellow-panelled joggers.

The former Neighbours actress, who lives in Chelsea with her magazine executive beau Paul Solomons, 46, opted for comfort in white trainers while adding a touch of glamour to her look with a quilted chain-strap handbag. 

Last month, the Princess of Pop detailed her experience filming the music video for her new single Say Something entirely in front of a green screen amid COVID-19 restrictions.

'It was a different shoot with the restrictions but it felt good to be back on set,' the songstress told The Herald Sun. 

In the clip, Kylie rides a horse statue as a salute to Bianca Jagger, who famously rode a white horse on the Studio 54 dance floor. 

'The horse was the star of the show. I don't think my galactic steed was designed to be ridden, but I fell in love with him, he was gorgeous,' she said.

'I hope when people see it, it takes them to another level and away to wherever their happy place is.' 

Her new project marks her 15th studio album for the artist, who has a global cult following in her native Australia and the UK.  

The album is said to be a return to form for Kylie, whose last record Golden was a country-inspired effort.
