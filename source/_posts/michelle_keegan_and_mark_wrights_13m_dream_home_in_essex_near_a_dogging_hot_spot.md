Michelle Keegan and Mark Wright's £1.3 million dream home in Essex is reportedly near a dogging hot spot.

The Sun has claimed people who have engaged in outdoor sex in the rural area have boasted about their escapades online.

In July, the actress and presenter, both 33, had the country house demolished to create their own Georgian-style four bedroom mansion. 

Raunchy: Michelle Keegan and Mark Wright's £1.3 million dream home in Essex is reportedly close-by to a dogging hot spot

The publication alleged an advert on an adult site read: 'The countryside near ***** is good for dogging and flashing. Loads of secluded laybys and woods etc. Also on the golf course at night. Seen some couples putting on a show after dark. You've just gotta drop lucky.'

A man in his 40s reportedly wrote: 'Out with my female friend this weekend for fun and frolics in the ***** Lane area. Good-looking peeps only.'

Another site dedicated to outdoor sex just years away from the TV stars new property is believed to have had a post which read: 'Loads of places near ***** and Chelmsford for dogging and flashing – socially distanced of course. The woods near the end of the road are great. Plenty of cover so fun to be had.'

Guidelines suggest you should remain socially distant from anyone in another household, remaining two metres apart where possible, or one metre with other measures.

Not shy! People who have engaged in outdoor sex in the rural area have allegedly boasted about their escapades online (their property pictured before they demolished it)

Technically sex or cuddling is against the guidelines, although you cannot be fined for flouting it.

Potential sexual partners should discuss Covid-19 and ask if they or anyone in their household have had symptoms or tested positive.

A representative for Mark and Michelle declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. 

Make way: In July, the actress and presenter, both 33, have the country house demolished to create their own Georgian-style four bedroom mansion

The former Corrie star and entertainment reporter's new abode will feature a huge swimming pool, a bar and a make-up room.

Floor plans posted on the Epping Council website showed the couple's blueprints also feature a playroom for any future children.

The duo bought the home for £1.3 million in October last year, and the project is being designed by Essex-based company MP Architects. 

Their luxury new home briefly caused concern recently, when the land was tested for asbestos. 

Wow! Floor plans posted on the Epping Council website showed that the couple's blueprints also feature a playroom for any future children

While they had no objections from neighbours, they withdrew requests for 'demolition of an existing stable building' to build a 'one-bedroom annexe'. 

Images of the ground floor show the home is set to give a nod to both their love of work and play, with a gym and bar placed either side of the huge kitchen.

The first floor meanwhile shows an equally impressive plan, with a balcony extending from the master bedroom, which includes a dressing room and make-up room. 

Every bedroom features an en suite while cupboards are littered through the floor. The first floor features three bedrooms. Second floor plans show two more bedrooms and further en suites.

Set on sprawling grounds, the rear of the house boasts a swimming pool plan while the vast drive is set to accommodate a plethora of cars. 

Their planning agent previously said: 'This new house has been carefully designed so that it is similar in area and volume to what is currently on the site.

'The new house will sit further back on the site and will create a much more functional family dwelling for our clients.

'The existing house has been extended several times and is not functional, therefore a new house would be a better use of the site.'
