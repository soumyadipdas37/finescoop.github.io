A 26-year-old woman and her partner have been charged after they allegedly snuck into New South Wales from Victoria illegally just days before she gave birth.

The woman, who was heavily pregnant, was part of a group of ten Malaysian nationals who were stopped a border checkpoint on the Murray Valley Highway, Euston, on August 17.

The group told police they intended to drive to Coffs Harbour, on the NSW Central Coast, from Victoria to find work as fruit pickers.

They were turned away and told they would need to fly into Sydney and quarantine in a hotel for 14 days at their own expense instead.

Two people, including a new mum, have been charged after they allegedly crossed the border illegally  (pictured, the border checkpoint at Albury)

10 days after the crossing attempt, police in Coffs Harbour were alerted that the couple had presented at Coffs Harbour Hospital (pictured)

Victoria: Completely open, but other states are banning residents from going there

NSW: Border with Victoria is closed but others are open without restriction

Queensland: Open to everywhere but Victoria, NSW, and the ACT

Northern Territory: Open to everywhere but Victoria and Sydney, which must do hotel quarantine

South Australia: Closed to Victoria, NSW arrivals must self-isolate, rest are open

Tasmania: Closed to Victoria, everywhere else must do hotel quarantine

Western Australia: Closed to everywhere without an exemption 

But just ten days later, police were alerted to a couple who allegedly crossed the border unlawfully - with the woman going to Coffs Harbour Hospital to give birth.

She was alleged accompanied by a 28-year-old man who had been with her during the failed border crossing attempt.

The woman was discharged from hospital on Monday and police issued the pair with Court Attendance Notices for not complying with noticed direction in regards to COVID-19.

The pair will appear in Coffs Harbour Local Court on September 14, 2020.

Eight other people were issued with fines in the last 24 hours.

One $1,000 fine was issued to a 25-year-old man who broke self-isolation directions after arriving to Sydney from Melbourne.  

Two men, aged 22 and 25, were issued with $1,000 after police were called to a resort in Jindabyne on August 26.

Around 30 people are believed to have been partying inside the staff quarters of the resort.

More fines are expected to be issued in regards to this incident.

Fines were also issued in regards to parties in Lethbridge Park, Jerseyville and King Street Wharf, in Sydney's CBD.

The King Street Wharf incident involved a boat where at least 40 people were on board.

Officers determined the business's COVID Safety Plan was incomplete and the manager was fined $5,000.

The NSW border with Victoria closed on July 7 at 11.59pm, meaning no one from Victoria can cross into the state without an exemption.

Exemptions include critical service providers such as miners, emergency service workers, anyone requiring medical treatment, children attending school and people who need to meet legal obligations.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced an easing of the border permit system with Victoria, as fierce debates rage on about the coronavirus closures.   

Ms Berejiklian visited Albury on Tuesday to announce a 50km border buffer zone on either side to allow agricultural workers to cross into NSW more easily.

The permits are expected to be available for residents by Friday, making it easier to travel for work and ease 'angst and frustration' among locals. 

But the same can't be said for Queensland, where premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed her state's border wouldn't open until at least October - despite the state economy hemorrhaging $17million a day.
