Neil Jones and Luisa Eusse have continued to fuel marriage rumours after posing for a sensual couples photoshoot. 

The couple - who only went public with their relationship a month ago - shared images from their saucy woodland shoot in which they couldn't keep their hands off one another. 

Flashing their heavily tattooed arms, the couple coordinated in black outfits as they kissed and cuddled in front of a stunning forest backdrop.

Luisa, 23, looked incredible in a black gown with a thigh high split and cut out detailing across her back. 

The Spanish stunner draped herself across Neil as she posed seductively and smouldered down the camera lens. 

Neil, 38, looked besotted with Luisa as he pulled her in for a passionate embrace.

Loved-up: As Neil shared the photos on Instagram, Luisa was quick to proclaim that it had been love at first sight for the pair 

Sharing the photographs on Instagram, Neil penned: 'Do you believe in fate?' adding the Spanish translation, 'Crees en el destino?'

Luisa was quick to comment: 'With you, I believe in everything, in love at first sight, in luck, in destiny, but above all I believe in your sweet and pure love.' 

Also sharing the images, Luisa penned a passionate post in Spanish in which she claimed Cupid had brought them together and referred to Neil as her 'husband'.

Husband? Also sharing the images, Luisa penned a passionate post in Spanish in which she claimed Cupid had brought them together and referred to Neil as her 'husband'

She wrote: 'How crazy, but how nice to have found my love, both vibrating in the same tunes, so strong and so pure, that Cupid stopped when he saw us go by, we created music and fire just by looking at each other and you made me feel safe while sliding my hands through your red hair.

'Love is blind, you may physically fit in with anyone, but the soul does not smile or vibrate with anyone, it is true that beauty attracts, but when one day you write his name to fill the gaps in the notebook without realising it, that's feeling.

'Thank you for your beautiful, free and sensible love and I could tell you that any place is my home, only if you are the one who opens the door ♥ ️ Love u Husband.' 

Moving fast: The Strictly pro only went public with girlfriend Luisa Jones née Eusse a month ago, but there have since been clues that the couple have secretly tied the knot

The steamy snaps did little to quell rumours that the couple have secretly tied the knot.

Just last month, Luisa shocked when she revealed she had taken his surname Jones and doubled down by calling him her 'husband' in her post.    

Things have been moving very fast for the couple, as last month, Luisa took to her Instagram stories to share a boomerang of her zooming into her post, which showed her mail was being sent to 'Luisa Jones'. 

In another Instagram post on Sunday, she donned a bridal white outfit consisting of a blazer, trousers and bralet as she penned 'Jones' with a heart emoji, seemingly referring to her new surname.

The rumours come after Neil's ex-wife Katya gave the seal of approval to his new relationship by liking a loved-up Instagram picture of the pair.

Professional dancer Neil shared a steamy black and white snap kissing and cuddling dancer Luisa captioned with a love heart.

And Katya, 31, who is also a star on Strictly Come Dancing, wasted no time liking the sweet post, showing that she's happy he has moved on.

The couple's six-year marriage ended in 2018, months after pictures emerged of Katya kissing her dance partner Seann Walsh, 34, on a night out.
