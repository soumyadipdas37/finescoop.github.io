Gary Neville has hailed Mo Salah following the Liverpool star's hat-trick in the 4-3 victory over Leeds, highlighting the striker's 'killer' instinct.

The Egyptian netted twice from the penalty spot and volleyed brilliantly into the top corner as the Reds recorded a thrilling Premier League opening day win at Anfield.

Salah has scored a remarkable 94 goals in his first three seasons on Merseyside and Neville was been left highly impressed by the 28-year-old's ruthlessness after he made the perfect start to the 2020-21 campaign.

'We know he's some player,' Neville told Sky Sports. 'But when he's getting to a level whereby four years ago, when he first arrived at Liverpool, he got 40 goals and we thought that's a freak, he won't be able to live with that. Then he consistently produces over a period of two or three years.'

Salah won the Premier League golden boot in his debut season at Liverpool, scoring 32 goals after completing a £34million move from Roma.

He then followed up with 27 goals in all competitions in 2018-19 as Liverpool lifted the Champions League trophy, and registered 23 goals as the Reds won the top flight for the first time since 1990.  

The former Chelsea man has played his part in a tenacious attacking trident alongside Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane, and Neville has compared Liverpool's leading lights to former Manchester United team-mates Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney.

Neville believes Salah will 'go above' the 'selfless' Sadio Mane in years to come

'We had debate between Mane and Salah last season. Players love Mane, he does selfless thing for the team. Salah doesn't pass at times, bit more selfish and less likable. I look at him as an outsider and think he's a killer on the pitch. 

'It reminds me of Ronaldo and Rooney back in the day, Mane and Salah. And I think Salah will go above Mane. The reason these players are different is they've got something in their head where go home at night and being best player in the world rules their world. Mane or Rooney, they fight for their team.  

Mane has plundered 81 goals in 172 appearances since joining Liverpool from Southampton in a £34m deal in June 2016, trailing Salah's tally by 16 goals.
