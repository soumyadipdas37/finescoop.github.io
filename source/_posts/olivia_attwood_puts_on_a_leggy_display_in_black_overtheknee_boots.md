It comes after Olivia shocked her TOWIE castmates during Wednesday night's episode by finally making the decision to leave Essex and 'prioritise' being with Bradley. 

During the show the blonde beauty explained how she was feeling conflicted about spending so much time away from her beau and being with the girls in Essex. 

Revealing her decision at the end of the show, Olivia said: 'I've got everything I've ever wanted waiting in Manchester, a whole life I'm missing out on. 

'These last few weeks saying I feel conflicted and feel I've come to realisation i need to be up there a bit more permanently. It's the right thing to do, it's just sad isn't it.'

Olivia's revelation left Nicole Bass and Clelia Theodorou in shock with the former Love Islander having to tell them to not cry and struggling not to give them a hug, which she couldn't do due to social distancing rules.

Nicole could be seen getting emotion as she said: 'It's so hard. I'm happy for your future but I'm gonna miss you so much.' 

Before walking away, Olivia said: 'The last year has been amazing, so many highs and some of the best times of life. Some people are going to miss me, and some not so much. 

'But I know who I am and I've got pals for life. So girls, there's no time like the present. I'm gonna leave now before any more drama starts.'
