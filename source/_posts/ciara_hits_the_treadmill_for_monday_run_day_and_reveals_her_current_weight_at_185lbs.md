Ciara is one motivating mama. 

The 34-year-old singer took to Instagram to share a 'Monday, run day' video as she tackles her postpartum weight loss goal of losing 48lbs overall and four by the end of the week.

In July, Ciara welcomed her third baby, Win Harrison Wilson, with her pro-football star husband Russell Wilson.

Motivating Monday: Ciara took to Instagram to share a 'Monday, run day' video as she tackles her postpartum weight loss goal of losing 48lbs overall and four by the end of the week

In the video, Ciara was makeup free and in the middle of a grueling sweat session on the treadmill which had been outfitted with some sort of device to trap her body heat in - presumably to aid in her weight loss.

Despite what seemed like an intense run, the beauty was upbeat and all smiles as she clapped and freestyled her own motivating song. 

The star then updated her 26.1 million followers on her journey to get her pre-baby body back, revealing that she currently weighs 185lbs.

While she has previously set her goal at losing 48lbs total, the TV host said that she has a short term goal of dropping 4lbs by the end of the week.

'I lost 20lbs since the baby,' the stunning songbird told the camera midstride. 'My goal this week is to lose 4lbs. I really wanna say five because I'm determined.'

'Let's get it! It's Monday. Monday, funday? Nah,' she mused trying to find and inspiring catch phrase. 'Monday, run day? Hey!'

'My goal this week is to lose 4lbs,' she continued. 'I really wanna say five because I'm determined.'

Reaching her goal seems more than possible with the rate the Goodies singer was already going at the start of the week.

Stunner: Ciara started the process of getting back into shape just a few weeks ago at the end of August after welcoming son Win Harrison Wilson, with her pro-football star husband Russell Wilson

Ciara started the process of getting back into shape just a few weeks ago at the end of August. 

In an Instagram post she penned: '48lbs to go! Starting the game plan tomorrow!! P.s. don’t know how easy it’s going be considering 3 baby’s now! Going to work really hard at this! Let’s go Mamma’s.'

She and Russell share a three-year-old daughter called Sienna and also raise Future, Ciara's six-year-old son by the rapper of the same name.

The hitmaker gave birth to Win on July 23 this year and announced the good news with an Instagram video the following day.

Wearing a sparkly black mask and holding her baby to her chest, Ciara lay in her hospital bed and sang Happy Birthday To You.

'Happy Birthday WIN!!! Mommy & Daddy Love You!' she gushed in the caption. 'Win Harrison Wilson 7.23.2020 8lbs 1 oz.'

Win is already following in his father's footsteps and sported his very own custom Seattle Seahawks uniform to celebrate the beginning of football season over the weekend.
