They try to build up his image: There are several shots of the singer looking like a pinup

She pulls her glasses down to look at something, showing heavy eye makeup.

Then Jennifer is in a black halter top with diamond earrings; she is in a Rolls-Royce then she puts her feet up as if she is in some kind of meeting.  

She changes up her hair looks almost daily - in the morning she can have short locks and later that night it's down to her bottom.

But in this clip she has curls on top of her head.

Lopez shared in her Instagram caption: 'My two song collaboration Pa’ Ti - Lonely with @Maluma is almost here! ✨ 

'Don’t miss the @TikTok Live: Behind the Video and two-part premiere event this Thursday at 6pm EST / 3pm PST. It all starts on TikTok.'

The Bronx beauty's next film Marry Me with Maluma and Owen opens on February 12, 2021. It's a romantic comedy directed by Kat Coiro.

According to the film's website, J-Lo plays musical superstar Kat Valdez.

Owen Wilson is Charlie Gilbert, a math teacher, and they are 'total strangers who agree to marry and then get to know each other.'

The film is an 'unlikely romance about two different people searching for something real in a world where value is based on likes and followers, Marry Me is a modern love story about celebrity, marriage and social media.

'Kat Valdez (Lopez) is half of the sexiest celebrity power couple on Earth with hot new music supernova Bastian (Maluma, making his feature-film debut). As Kat and Bastian’s inescapable hit single, “Marry Me,” climbs the charts, they are about to be wed before an audience of their fans in a ceremony that will streamed across multiple platforms.'

They are a team: Here the duo are seen during a break from working together on Pa' Ti

And he will be in her next movie: Maluma will also be in her 2021 romantic comedy film Marry Me with Owen Wilson 

But then things change when divorced high-school math teacher Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) has been dragged to the concert by his daughter Lou (Chloe Coleman, HBO’s Big Little Lies) and his best friend (Sarah Silverman). 

'When Kat learns, seconds before the ceremony, that Bastian has cheated on her with her assistant, her life turns left as she has a meltdown on stage, questioning love, truth and loyalty. As her gossamer world falls away, she locks eyes with a stranger—a face in the crowd.

In a moment of 'inspired insanity,' Kat chooses to marry Charlie. 

'What begins as an impulsive reaction evolves into an unexpected romance. But as forces conspire to separate them, the universal question arises: Can two people from such different worlds bridge the gulf between them and build a place where they both belong?'

Her future husband: Lopez and Alex Rodriguez attend the Hustlers premiere during the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival in September
