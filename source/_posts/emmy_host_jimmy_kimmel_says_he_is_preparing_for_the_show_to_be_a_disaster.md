Jimmy Kimmel will be 'amused' if the Emmy Awards go wrong.

The 52-year-old talk show host will anchor Sunday's ceremony from the Staples Centre in Los Angeles but the nominees will be on video link from their own homes and there will be no live audience.

 'I have a weird masochistic streak where I enjoy putting myself in difficult situations,' joked the comedian to The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday. 'So if the worst happens and it all breaks down, there will definitely be a part of me that is amused by it.'

Let the crazy begin! Jimmy Kimmel will be 'amused' if the Emmy Awards go wrong. The 52-year-old talk show host will anchor Sunday's ceremony from the Staples Centre in Los Angeles but the nominees will be on video link from their own homes and there will be no live audience

Jimmy added: 'I sometimes step outside my body and laugh at myself. So whatever happens, it'll be OK.

'I mean, it's just a television show. It's not like I'm flying a jet.'

Jimmy - who hosted the 2017 Oscars when the Best Picture award was famously handed to the wrong movie - admitted reliance on technology means there's a potential for the ceremony to be a 'beautiful disaster'.

Asked what would make the evening a disaster, he told the Reporter: 'If they give the wrong Emmy to the wrong show.

'No, it would be a disaster if we can't get the nominees and winners on the air. That will be a disaster, but it could also be a beautiful disaster.'

And the presenter doesn't have a plan B in place if things go wrong.

Discussing his back-up plan, he said: 'Nothing, really. I mean, honestly, nothing. If something happens technically, I will be touching upon all the skills I've acquired over the course of my life.

'I know one magic trick. I can kind of juggle. I guess I could draw caricatures of the crew.

'We are heavily relying on Wi-Fi for this Emmys -- more than any show ever has before.'

And the host can also see some positives in the unusual set-up for the evening.

He said: 'We've got some people who are going to be a part of the show who don't typically do this, and that's exciting for me. I don't want to blow anything, but I think that's going to be fun for people to see.

His pal may be on: Jennifer Aniston, seen in January, is Emmy nominated for her work in The Morning Show

'The big public spectacle that is usually the Emmys scares some people away, and we're going to take advantage of that --of those who aren't scared away.'

Emmy Awards bosses have admitted the upcoming ceremony is a 'logistic nightmare'.

The annual event will take place virtually with 130 stars being sent fully-assembled broadcasting units featuring a camera, laptop, ring light and boom mic, so they can connect up via video link for the nominations and acceptance speeches, and producers have admitted there's a huge possibility that things could go badly wrong.

He is used to stress: Jimmy added: 'I sometimes step outside my body and laugh at myself. So whatever happens, it'll be OK. 'I mean, it's just a television show. It's not like I'm flying a jet.' With Joe Biden

Explaining Los Angeles' Staples Center, where the ceremony will broadcast from, was the only facility that could handle so many incoming signals, executive producer Ian Stewart joked: 'You have so many things coming in and also so many things that can stop coming in.

'Trying to get to the middle of nowhere to get one of [the camera units] installed in somebody's house and to get it up and running ― and, of course, under all of the precautions that we obviously are taking ― is a logistic nightmare. How could it possibly go wrong?'

And while fellow executive producer Reginald Hudlin thinks the video links will offer a more relaxed and authentic feel to the ceremony, he thinks the possibility of chaos will add to the fun and admitted they aren't entirely sure how well things will work.

He said during a virtual press conference: 'We're essentially making things up as we go along.

He has a way with a quip: The star is cool under pressure; seen with icon Diane Keaton

'I know that's not the most reassuring answer, but it's kind of the truth! We've never done this before.' 

Kimmel will be joined at the Staples Center by around a dozen famous faces for various sketches because bosses didn't want to go down the 'easy route' of pre-recording most of the segments.

Ian said: 'We decided let's not do the easy route here and the sanitized route here and do lots of prerecorded things and put them all together and bolt them back to back and put out something that's sort of generic.

'We're in this time ― a stumbling block can be a steppingstone depending on how you use it.

'This is a time to be a bit loose and to have a lot more fun, so live, live, live, live, live, live, live, whenever we can do live.

'And things like a nomination package is pretty hard to do live, but anything that we can do live, we will do live.'
