Armie Hammer and his estranged wife Elizabeth Chambers announced their separation following 10 years of marriage and two children together in July.

And on Wednesday, the television personality, 38, revealed their three-year-old son Ford Douglas Armand, three, and daughter Harper Grace, five, were continuing their studies in the Cayman Islands, where the trio has been in lockdown for months.  

'A couple days late and my sad signs didn't survive the humidity or enthusiasm. BUT, Monday marked their second week of kindergarten and pre-k IRL in GC and the first day of Zoom Kindergarten for Hops at her school in LA,' the mother-of-two captioned two pictures of her high-spirited little ones.

She added: 'Happy back-to-school, whatever that means to you! ❤️' 

In the first shot, her mini-me posed with one arm in the air, before holding out her homemade white sign, which read: 'Second week of Kindergarten IRL, first day of distance kindergarten.'  

Meanwhile her younger brother initially kept his sign on his head, then chucked it in the air and smiled from ear-to-ear.

The siblings matched in khaki shorts and sneakers, as they returned to school. 

On Tuesday, Chambers also shared a snapshot of her eldest completing some homework with the caption, 'I miss summer.' 

In June, she shared a similar set of images of her kids on their last day of school in Grand Cayman, while reflecting on 'the strangest school year that we never saw coming.'

'Happy back-to-school, whatever that means to you! ❤️' Chambers captioned the two adorable pictures of her high-spirited little ones in front of some tropical plants

'We went from discouraging our children from iPads and screens to begging them to sit in front of them for Zoom classes. Their anti-bias Zoom assemblies were replaced with real life lessons and here we are,' she wrote at the time. 

Additionally, she wrote that she was 'continuously amazed by' and 'and grateful for the teachers who pivoted so quickly and learned new skills.'

Her update comes a month after revealing she and The Call Me by Your Name actor, 34, were splitting up.   

'Thirteen years as best friends, soulmates, partners and then parents. It has been an incredible journey, but together, we’ve decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage,' thw pair said in a joint statement on July 10; seen in 2019

'Thirteen years as best friends, soulmates, partners and then parents. It has been an incredible journey, but together, we’ve decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage,' Chambers and Hammer said in a joint statement on July 10.

The parted pair said they would remain cordial and friendly in the wake of the split.

'As we enter into this new chapter, our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority,' they said. 'We understand this news lends itself to public dialogue, but in the interest of our children and our family, we’re asking for privacy, compassion and love during this time.' 

Support circle: Armie is living and spending time with a family friend following his split with Elizabeth 

As his children remain in the Cayman Islands with their mom, Armie recently shared a shot of his friend, whose name is Ashton Ramsey, on a hike at California's Joshua Tree National Park.

'This one of my best friends, Ashton. For the last 2 months or so I have lived with Ashton, worked construction with Ashton, and hiked with Ashton every day,' the Santa Monica, California native said. 

The star added: 'He has been such a good friend (and boss) and has been the most supportive friend anyone could ever ask for.'
