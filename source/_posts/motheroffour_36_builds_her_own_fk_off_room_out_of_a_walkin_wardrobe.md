A mother-of-four has created her own 'f**k off' room that nobody else in her household is allowed to enter, complete with a computer, craft supplies and a flamingo lamp.

Lisa Heenan, 36, runs a very busy household with four children, three dogs and a cat so occasionally when she wants to let off some steam, she enters her 'f**k off' space. 

'So I turned my walk-in wardrobe into my very own f*** off room. I have four kids aged 15, 13, 12 and eight, three labradors and a Himalayan Persian and they are all banned from this room,' the graphic designer from Queensland wrote on Facebook.

The space, which she created a year ago, has become a sanctuary for Lisa when life has become a little bit overwhelming

The space, which she created a year ago, has become a sanctuary for Lisa when life gets a little bit overwhelming.  

'Two of my children are on the spectrum. They are both high functioning, though some days are tough with one of my sons having ADHD,' she told FEMAIL.

'I love them all dearly but just like all mums and parents sometimes we just need a break. 

'About a year ago I moved all of my clothes into the identical wardrobe I have on the other side of my en-suite and created this space for my sanity.'

She emblazoned the swear word inside the room because it 'tells her kids exactly what she doesn't want to say out loud'.  

'My sense of humour won't be to everyone's taste but wouldn't this world be boring if we were all the same?' she said.

Almost all of the furniture was purchased from IKEA and the pink flamingo lamp is from Kmart

'I'm a freelance graphic designer so I have my computer in there and all of my craft and party supplies,' she said.  

She uses the space 'all the time' after she has spent time with her beautiful kids and plans on purchasing a pink bar fridge to store wine and chocolate in it.

For those that might want to take inspiration from her, Lisa said not to think twice about it.   

'Just do it. As parents we all deserve a space where we can relax and be ourselves outside of being mum and dad,' she said.
