New York schools will have a daily coronavirus report card that parents and teachers can consult to ensure health and safety plans are being adequately implemented, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday. 

Every K-12 school in the state will have its own report outlining the testing and case data.  

The state has created a dedicated website that parents can search to find out how many positive cases the school is reporting and whether students who test positive were in the classroom or learning remotely.

Parents will also be able to see the number of students on site, the percentage of students and staff testing positive as well as the number of tests administered by the school. 

'I think this will give parents confidence, teachers confidence, they'll know on a day-to-day basis exactly what is happening. They won't be reliant on communication from the school district, from the principal, from anyone else,' Cuomo said at a press briefing.

The number of tests administered by the school, the type of test, the lab used, and how much of a lag there is between the test and getting the results.

 

'If I'm going to make a decision to send my children back to school, I'm going to be darn sure that the plan is smart, they can do the plan and then I want to know if they're actually implementing the plan,' he added. 

'It's a big undertaking, I thank the Department of Health in advance, but it's very important.' 

Local school districts, testing laboratories and local health departments will all provide the information to the New York Department of Health. 

The announcement comes about a month after Cuomo gave the green light for 749 New York school districts to return students to classrooms this Fall, including in New York City.

The decision was left with the schools themselves, however, on how they wished to continue - whether to stay online or use a mixture of both online and in-classroom learning. 

'If anybody can open schools, we can open schools. And that's true for every region in the state, period,' Cuomo said. 

In August, all schools were required to submit their plan for reopening to the state and required town halls be held with parents and school officials. 

Last week, New York City announced it was pushing back the start of the school year until September 21, after striking an agreement with local labor unions asking for additional coronavirus safety measures. 

'What we've agreed to is to make sure that the health measures are in place, to make sure there is time for the appropriate preparation for our educators, to make sure that we can have the smoothest beginning of the school year even under extraordinarily challenging conditions,' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

De Blasio revealed Tuesday that the city had inspected more than 1,400 schools and found 96 percent of their classrooms passed ventilation system requirements.

Cuomo also announced Tuesday that New York may force colleges with more than 100 cases to switch to remote learning. 

He said the regulations would provide a check on the procedures put in place by colleges.

'You have all your protocols. That's nice,' Cuomo told a news conference. 'If the state sees a cluster - just like colleges, just like workplaces, just like restaurants - we see a cluster in a school we are going to come in, override everything.'

Cuomo criticized the administration of New York University for not preventing a large gathering of students in nearby Washington Square Park in New York City on Saturday night, and listed several other colleges in the state that have had spikes in COVID-19 cases.





He said colleges must now report to the state's health department when they have in excess of 100 cases, a threshold that would require a shift to remote classes unless there were extenuating circumstances.

'Colleges across the country are seeing outbreaks,' he said. 'This is going to be a problem.'

Over the Labor Day weekend, New York hit one straight month of the COVID-19 infection rate remaining below 1 percent. 

'Thanks to the hard work of New Yorkers, our state has now gone a full month with our COVID infection rate remaining below one percent,' Cuomo said. 

'Our numbers have continued to remain stable even as we reach new milestones in our phased, data-driven reopening. As we close out this Labor Day Weekend, I urge everyone to remain smart so we can continue to celebrate our progress in the weeks and months ahead. 

'It took the work of all of us to get here, and to protect this progress we will need to all continue to wash our hands, wear our masks, remain socially distant and above all, stay New York tough.' 

There were five new deaths in the state reported Tuesday and 445 hospitalizations. 

There have been 440,578 coronavirus cases in New York and 25,367 deaths. 

More than 232,000 of these cases and 19,098 confirmed deaths were in New York City.
