'I do feel like shooting during COVID time is really different. We all get tested a day before our shoots,' Jenner explained while being primped.

'We do, like, a rapid test just so everyone feels comfortable. We have more of a closed set, so just like the bare minimum of people. And then everyone gets their temperature checked before we come in.'

And while the Kylie Cosmetics CEO's glam squad - make-up artist Ariel Tejada and two hairstylists - made sense, it's unclear why she needed her childhood friend Harry Hudson to be there. The star also had her own private chef. 

Wow: Kylie also had her own private chef on shoot who made her favourite foods

Talking during the video, Chef K said she was making her favourite salads - taco turkey salad, Chinese chicken salad and a chicken bowl with veggies. 

And for pudding, the chef had made cookies and banana bread, they joked: 'And whatever else she wants!'

Jenner said in the seven-minute vlog: 'The collection is definitely one of my favorites. I say that every time, but I do feel my collections just progress with time.'

On Tuesday, the artificially plumped-lipped socialite reunited with her ex-boyfriend Travis Scott for a family portrait with their two-year-old daughter Stormi on the steps of her $36.5M Holmby Hills mansion.

It's unclear if the 28-year-old Grammy nominee then joined Kylie for a private screening at a nearly empty cinema with her momager Kris Jenner.

Jenner and Travis (born Jacques Webster) were said to have 'taken space apart' from their two-year romantic relationship a year ago, according to TMZ.
