Grammy Award winning singer-songwriter Alicia Keys revealed some personal truths in bombshell interview with The Guardian that was released on Friday in tandem with her new album Alicia. 

Alicia, 39, revealed how her current success and good fortune was far from the path she felt she was destined for as she reflected on her musical journey. 

'I am that person [the underdog]' she said. 'The one that wasn’t supposed to make it out of Hell's Kitchen, who was supposed to end up being a prostitute, a young mother at 16 years old, or addicted to drugs.

Desolate upbringing: Alicia Keys, 39, revealed in an interview with The Guardian that she was destined for a life of prostitution or drug addiction based on the neighborhood she grew up in. The Grammy Award winning artist got candid as she reflected on her upbringing and new album Alicia

'I am the one who was supposed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and got injured or killed.' 

The singer discussed her upbringing more in depth, as she revealed, 'The New York that I came from was very dark, very desolate.'

When Alicia was born in the early 80s, her Hell's Kitchen neighborhood exemplified its namesake as it was known to be one of the dirtiest areas of NYC at the time.

The release of her 2007 uplifting anthem, New York, with Jay-Z caused Keys to have a number of realizations when it came to analyzing where she came from and how it informed her sense of self. 

'It was all porno places, with hookers on every corner' she said. 

When Alicia first busted onto the global music scene in 2001 with her single Fallin' the budding R&B starlet exemplified an air that was very different than popstar counterparts like Britney Spears. 

Reflecting on how her unsafe surroundings informed both her identity as an artist and her personal style she said:

'I had to always wear something very baggy, very dark, always had my hair back; I felt like if people saw me, they might try to touch me. That’s why I’ve always been such a tomboy.'

Tomboy: 'For a lot of girls it still is a safety risk to walk the streets' Alicia said when thinking about how she felt growing up in Hell's Kitchen back in the 80s

Often clad in hats, oversized jackets and looser jeans, her upbringing coupled with her musical conviction thwarted the inauthentic road to sex symbolism unlike many other female artists during the time.

'I’ve never been the one in pretty dresses and nails, because I could not have nails and hair. And for a lot of girls it still is a safety risk to walk the streets' she revealed.  

Discussing the juxtaposition of her neighborhood to that of Broadway just a few blocks away she said it gave her 'this polarizing weird dynamic of the have-nots and the maybe-possiblies' but also propelled her to greatness. 

As Alicia evolved as a musician she continued to throw her heart and her past into her music. 

Underdog: 'I am that person' she said after sharing that all the songs she has ever written that are supposed to be empowering come from her writing at her lowest point

Her new album, Alicia, features a number of songs that all have a nod to New York City and her upbringing. 

'All the songs I’ve ever written that have been considered empowering or uplifting, I’ve written them at my lowest point. Because I needed to remind myself: don’t forget that' she shared. 

Touching on her new song Underdog she continues to piece together the parts of herself that have informed who she is as both a woman and an artist.  

Alicia also shared that her humble beginnings definitely helped her develop into a person with a level self-worth that is not defined by a dollar amount.

'No one wants to not be able to get food, or decent opportunities for your kids, but I’ve met plenty of billionaires and they are fucking miserable' the mother of two said. 

Though Keys has had a beyond successful music career 19 years after the release of her first album, Songs in A Minor, she revealed that the first time she felt like she produced an truly authentic piece of work was with the release of her 2016 album, Here.

'You work so hard at being digestible, at being something that people are not offended by. It becomes a habit – especially for women – and it really starts in childhood' she shared. 

Speaking out about causes that are important to her the singer revealed she poured her societal anger into the album.

Although it was not as commercially successful as records in the past she looks at as one of her best works ever. 

'For our whole life we’re trying to figure out how to be the good girl, when really, the bad girl is not bad, they’re just expressing another side, or in touch with anger or frustration' 

Though having a rough childhood, Alicia's talents as a singer-songwriter and her unwavering sense of self have solidified her as a household name. 

The 15-time Grammy winner and fiercely talented artist continues to grow with every piece of music, and now has become a wife and mother.

Alicia and her husband artist Swizz Beatz, 42, celebrated their 10-year anniversary over the summer. The musical duo have two children together, Egypt, nine, and Genesis, five.   

Her seventh studio album, Alicia, was released on September 18th.
