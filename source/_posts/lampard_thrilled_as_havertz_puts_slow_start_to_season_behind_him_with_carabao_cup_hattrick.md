Frank Lampard hailed the 'first of many great nights' for Kai Havertz after the Â£89million forward scored a hat-trick in the 6-0 rout of Barnsley.

The 21-year-old had endured a slow start to his Blues career after playing wide on the right on his debut against Brighton and then used centrally in the 2-0 defeat against LiverpoolÂ before being hauled off at half-time.

It led to Jamie Carragher questioning how the club's record signing fits intoÂ Chelsea's system after his low-key displays.

Lampard insistedÂ he knows Havertzâ€™s best position and that his role in the side will become clear when he reaches full fitness.

And Havertz responded in emphatic fashion in the No 10 role at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.Â 

'I'm delighted with Kai, it was everything I wanted the night to be for him,' said Lampard.

'Because Kai has had no pre-season, and signing for the club took a few days out for him as well.

'Tonight was a great exercise for him to see how we want to work off the ball, for him to be a part of that.

'He made a great recovery tackle for Ross' goal. And then to also just have some freedom on the ball and roam in more central areas.

'I thought it was a great combination with Tammy, and I was pleased with the way he grew into the game in terms of confidence. It was a great night for Kai, and the first of many for him.'

Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud all found the net to add to Havertz's hat-trick, with the German international thriving in the No 10 role.

Speaking after the match, Havertz said: "I'm very happy to score my first goal here at Chelsea, I'm very happy about the win and happy about my three goals and I hope we can continue like that."Â

Focusing on Abrahamâ€™s role in his performance, Havertz added: â€˜I think heâ€™s a very, very good striker and I think our partnership on the pitch was very good.Â Â 

â€˜It was our first game together but I like him very much as a striker. For me as a No. 10 itâ€™s very good to play with him.â€™Â
