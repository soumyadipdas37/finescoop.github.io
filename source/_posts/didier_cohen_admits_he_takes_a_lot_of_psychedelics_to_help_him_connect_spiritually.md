Didier Cohen has revealed he regularly uses psychedelic drugs. 

The 35-year-old American model and DJ made the bold confession in July by posting a TikTok video responding to a fan who questioned whether he condones drug use. 

Admitting that he 'gets asked this question all the time,' the long-haired Lothario explained that, while he shuns pharmaceutical drugs such as Advil and Tylenol, he does use 'plant medicine'.   

'Yes, I do a lot of psychedelics. Yes, I do plant medicine': Didier Cohen, 35, (pictured) spoke candidly about his use psychedelic drugs in a recent TikTok video  

'Yes, I do a lot of psychedelics. Yes, I do plant medicine,' he told fans while filming inside his California home.  

'I use these as a tool to look within. To look at myself, to look at bad behaviour, to connect spiritually,' he continued. 

By taking these drugs, Didier said he hopes to become a 'better, more connected person.'

'So no, I'm not condoning drugs,' he declared, continuing: 'But if [people] want to use plant medicine to better themselves down the spiritual path, I think there should be less stigma about judging people for the different types of tools they use.' 

Didier was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2018, after dealing with symptoms such as epilepsy, numbness, paralysis, fevers and bone pain since 2007. 

Since receiving his diagnosis, Didier has used alternative therapies such as hyperbaric chamber treatment and IV drips.
