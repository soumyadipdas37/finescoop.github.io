Betting has been suspended on Tom Hardy becoming the new James Bond as fans are convinced he will be named as Daniel Craig's replacement.

Speculation has reached fever pitch in recent days following reports the actor, 43, had been offered the iconic part after a successful audition.

All bets on who will be the next Bond are off, after Tom's odds were slashed from 6/1 into 1/1, amid the swirling rumours about the iconic part.

The Venom star has been one of the bookies favourites to take over the role since the market opened in September last year, when he was 9/1 to be cast as Bond.

When the bookmakers market closed, James Norton was the second favourite actor to bag the part at 9/4, followed by Idris Elba (11/2), Sam Heughan (6/1) and Richard Madden (7/1).  

Oddschecker spokesperson Callum Wilson: 'For years we've heard speculation about who will replace Daniel Craig as James Bond, and finally it seems that English heart-throb Tom Hardy is the man for the role. '

'The versatile Hardy would certainly be a popular choice – and attracted 54% of all bets in the 24 hours before the market was suspended.'

Tom has been one of the bookies favourites to become the next 007 in recent years, and rumours have been circulating he will step into Craig's shoes after his fifth and final film, No Time To Die.

The Vulcan Reporter claims that Hardy had been offered the iconic part after a successful audition, while bookies odds on the star have now been slashed in half.

The publication reports producers had planned to unveil Tom as James Bond in November- the same month No Time To Die was due to be released.

However, due to the coronavirus pandemic the Vulcan Reporter state the announcement will now be made later this year or early 2021.

Earlier this week bookies have slashed odds on The Peaky Blinders star from 8/1 to just 4/5 in the past 24 hours after a flurry of bets.

Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: 'A flurry of bets over the past 24 hours suggests the cat is out the bag and it's Tom Hardy that'll soon be replacing Daniel Craig as 007.' 

The Taboo star has made no secret about wanting to be the next 007 - but has previously refused to talk about the part in fear it will get him blacklisted. 

Speaking to the Daily Beast, the heart-throb admitted: 'If I mention it, it's gone.

'You know, there's a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting, and in the fellowship of my peer group, that if you talk about it you're automatically out of the race.

'So I can't possibly comment on that one!'
