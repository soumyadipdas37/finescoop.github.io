Finishing her boho-chic ensemble, the model opted for a pair of suede cowboy ankle boots with tassel detailing.

Adding some glamorous touches, Kelly finished her look with a black Chanel quilted handbag with a gold chain.

The presenter appeared to go makeup-free as she displayed her age-defying features and swept her brunette locks into a high ponytail.

Kelly appeared in great spirits after her radio duties and flashed a smile as she made her way home.   

The star's outing comes as she admitted she's 'not worried' about her 'weight creeping up'.

She also declared 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation', after revealing she shed a whopping two stone in March.

While she has been keeping busy by exercising at home, her diet consists of 'healthy, low-calorie meals' with sweet treats such as popcorn and homemade fruit lollies.

The brunette has been candid about her weight fluctuating, with the bombshell slimming down to a size 10-12 after going to a size 16.

On her current figure, she told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'

Home time! Kelly appeared in great spirits after her radio duties and flashed a smile as she made her way home
