Police in New York have arrested a homeless man who placed metal clamps on the subway tracks and watched, laughing, as the train derailed, injuring three people. 

The incident occurred in the West Village, as the uptown A train was entering the 14th St - Eighth Avenue station at 8:17 am.

The homeless man had found a pile of tie plates, which are normally used to secure the train tracks to the foundations, on a pile of construction materials at the 14th St. station, police sources told the New York Daily News. 

He took the plates and put them on the tracks before the train came into the station. 

When the train pulled in, three of the subway cars derailed - and the homeless man was seen laughing as the train swerved.

Subway service in Manhattan was severely impacted by the Sunday morning crash

About 30 people were evacuated from the train, and they helped detain the homeless man - who was spotted celebrating his accomplishment. 

He was arrested and taken away by police, who are yet to file charges.

Three passengers suffered minor injuries. 

One refused medical attention. Another was treated at the scene while the third was taken to Bellevue Hospital for further treatment, officials said. 

The wheels on one of the derailed train cars were destroyed in the crash, and a third rail in the station collapsed upon impact, knocking out power to all four tracks in the station. Other rails were also badly damaged. 

The power outage affected other trains on the line, with an A train becoming stuck in a tunnel beneath 34th Street.

All uptown A, C, D, E and F trains are being rerouted, causing extensive delays in Manhattan.
