She has been posting a slew of racy bikini pictures to her Instagram account. 

And Yazmin Oukhellou displayed her jaw-dropping curves once more in a beige swimsuit as she went for a swim in Hertfordshire on Wednesday. 

The TOWIE beauty, 25, sizzled in the chic number after mistaking the time for her personal training session, which inspired her to make the most of her early morning and take a dip in her gym pool.

She flashed her ample assets in the textured nude one-piece which featured a scooped neckline and high-leg finish. 

The striking number was complete with large gold buckles on both straps whichwas set against her gold Cartier bracelet. 

Yazmin also styled her chocolate tresses in a stylish low ponytail and opted for a natural makeup look. 

The brunette beauty reflected on the positive benefits of morning exercise as she told her Instagram followers: 'I've just been for my swim, I feel so good. 

'For those of you that can get up a bit earlier in the mornings and maybe do a bit of exercise, or go for a swim, trust me, do it.

'It changes your whole day, I just feel so great now! I feel like I'm full of endorphins, I'm positive, I'm ready to take on the day. 

'I've got an event later for RIRI hair extensions which I'm really excited about, and what else am I doing? 

'I've got some meetings this morning about something very exciting dropping soon, I don't know have I'm containing myself and keeping this in, I literally can't wait to share this with you all because I know you're going to love it.

Yazmin explained that she visited her personal trainer this morning after mistaking the time for their fitness session as 9am instead of the correct 9pm.

She added: 'Yes, I've got my PT again at 9 tonight, that's the right time now, but look, I started driving there and didn't realise it was 9 tonight but my day is still great!

'It's gone great, so it can start off a little wrong, not as you expect but just don't let things get to you. There's so much more to life than letting things get to you and life is so short.'

The brunette beauty looked smitten on Tuesday evening as she stepped out with her boyfriend, James Lock, for dinner at Sexy Fish in Mayfair, London.  

She held hands with her beau, 33, as they strolled to the trendy eatery for their night out.

Yazmin had dumped Lockie over claims he had cheated on her during their romantic holiday in Turkey in 2019, and has said she still doesn't trust him but wouldn't say 'no' if he popped the question.

Speaking to The Sun, she said: 'We are trying to take things really slow but I know what I am like.  

'I do love him and if he did propose to me I would say yes and marry him. I still don't trust him but I do trust him more this time, which is strange because he messed up. But I do believe he has changed.'  

Yazmin also revealed that the couple are now having weekly therapy sessions via Zoom after starting during lockdown, which is helping get their broken relationship back on track. 

She added that her family and friends around her are still skeptical about the reunion and hopes to 'prove everyone wrong'.
