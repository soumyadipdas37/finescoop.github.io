 Former Vice President Joe Biden is holding leads in six battleground states over President Trump in a new survey taken after party conventions that failed to move the political needle.

New CNBC/Change Research polling released Wednesday shows the Democrat holding a 49 to 45 lead over the president in the six battlegrounds.

The poll surveyed Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a 49 to 45 lead in a new survey of six battleground states

Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin constitute the 'blue wall' that Trump managed to pry from Hillary Clinton in 2016.

North Carolina, Arizona, and Florida are states that Biden hopes to snatch from Trump's winning electoral college map.

Biden's Pennsylvania lead is four points, 50 to 46, in a state where his edge has been tightening since July. 

President Donald Trump has managed to narrow Biden leads in Florida and Pennsylvania, but still trails in the battlegrounds, as well as nationally

In Florida, Biden holds a narrow three-point lead, 49 to 46, where an eight point lead in July is now less than a percentage point in the Real Clear Politics average. 

Only in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin did Biden hit 50 percent.  Both candidates campaigned in Kenosha last week following violence and protests there, but other surveys have showed Trump's 'law and order' message is not prevailing in the state.

The swing state poll comes as the Trump camp has also shifted its focus to Minnesota, a state he narrowly lost that Democrats have carried since 1972. Under electoral college scenarios Trump could score an electoral college win with Minnesota even while giving up Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The push comes amid Trump's push for suburban voters amid social unrest.

A new NBC / Maris poll had Biden leading 53 to 44 in Pennsylvania, the state where Biden was born and held events during an otherwise sparse summer travel schedule.
