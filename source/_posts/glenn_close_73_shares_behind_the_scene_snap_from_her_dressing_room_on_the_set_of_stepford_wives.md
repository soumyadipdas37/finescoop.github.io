Iconic Hollywood actress Glenn Close shared never-before-seen snaps from her Stepford Wives days.

The 73-year-old Golden Globe winner took to Instagram on Thursday to give fans a behind the scenes look at her cinched undergarments from the 2004 film as she posed in her dressing room. 

Wearing nothing but a nude corset, she put her fantastic frame on display as she showed off for the camera in full hair and makeup.

Glenn who was 56 at the time of her role as Claire Wellington, looked fantastic for any age as she posed for the sultry '#tbt' that oozed Marilyn Monroe vibes.   

Taking a trip down memory lane, Close revealed some insider information as she discussed the 'unexpectedly long' filming process while flashing some skin. 

'Throw back to my dressing room at the Kaufman Astoria Studio in Astoria, Queens, where much of STEPFORD WIVES was shot. Rather elaborate underpinnings! Quite a challenge to wear for a full day of shooting!' she shared. 

'Beside me are Bill and Petey—my faithful entourage. Love the crinoline slip in the closet. It was an unexpectedly long shoot' she added as she admired every detail of the photo.

Glenn continued to  share with her fans, 'My dear friend Chris Walken and I didn’t know which of us were to be robots until the very end. Ironically, that uncertainty had no impact on our performances!!'.  

She added, 'Great wig built and styled by the genius wig maker, Martial Corneville' as she paid respect to the impeccable hair and makeup that pervaded all the women in the film.  

The 2004 film was a movie adaptation from a 1975 thriller novel of the same name. 

With a $90M budget the film garnered a star studded cast including Christopher Walken, Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick and Faith Hill.

In Close's real life she is nothing like her character though she does reside in a picturesque community on the east coast. 

The seven-time Oscar nominee has had an estate in Bedford, New York for almost 30 years that she calls Beanfield, though she finally sold it in February. 

The actress fancies herself a bit of an outdoors-woman as she frequently shares hiking snaps to social media of her and her Havanese, Pip on her down time.

Just days ago she revealed that she had fallen during hiking and had to receive nine stitches in her leg, though at her age she has proven to be quite resilient  

Close has also been incredibly devoted to her nonprofit organization Bring Change 2 Mind which focuses on mental health.

She shares a daughter, Annie Stark, 32, with friend and producer, John Starke, who she was linked to when she got her breakthrough role in Fatal Attraction in 1987.  

Glenn is set to appear in Hillbilly Elegy, a movie from Ron Howard that will be released on Netflix in November 2020.
