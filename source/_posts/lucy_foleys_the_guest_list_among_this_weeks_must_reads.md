The Guest List, by Lucy Foley (Harper Collins £8.99, 484 pp)

THE GUEST LIST 

by Lucy Foley (Harper Collins £8.99, 484 pp)

When ambitious magazine editor Julia plans her wedding to Will, the ruggedly handsome star of a popular television survival show, every detail has to be perfect.

The venue is a photogenic ancient folly on a remote Irish island, the guests include Julia's divorced parents and a posse of Will's laddish old school friends. What could possibly go wrong?

True, a gathering storm is causing problems with the electricity, and Julia is having to use all her steely willpower to ignore a handwritten note, warning her not to marry Will.

Still, everything will be fine — won't it? Dark secrets lurk on every page of Foley's best-selling thriller, a stylish follow-up to The Hunting Party.

May at 10, by Anthony Seldon (Biteback £12.99, 736 pp)

MAY AT 10

by Anthony Seldon (Biteback £12.99, 736 pp)

'Assessing the performance of a prime minister is a very inexact science,' writes Anthony Seldon. 

But as the author of five books on modern prime ministers, he is well placed to consider what history should make of Theresa May's premiership.

When Mrs May became prime minister in 2016, her overriding mission was to take Britain out of the European Union. 

But it became clear that she was painfully unsuited to the task. 

Hardworking, with a keen sense of duty, she was also shy, inflexible and unable to charm fellow world leaders, voters or even her own MPs.

In a balanced account based on interviews with 175 sources, Seldon concludes that 'not since Balfour has Britain had a prime minister so lacking in the skills that both the office and history demanded.'

Tall Tales And Wee Stories by Billy Connolly (John Murray Press £8.99, 336 pp)

TALL TALES AND WEE STORIES 

by Billy Connolly (John Murray Press £8.99, 336 pp)

'I love losing my way,' writes Billy Connolly. 'I love wandering off down long and winding streets, turning corners and seeing what's there. And I love getting lost in my stories for the same reason.'

While he was performing live, Billy was reluctant to publish his routines in book form but believes 'this feels like the right moment to put these stories down, once and for all.'

The sound of those inimitable Glaswegian tones, fulminating against 'beige people, intent on turning the world into one great massive bore', echo from every page.

Bracingly sweary, robustly rude and brilliantly original, this is essential reading for fans of the Big Yin.
