While speculation abounded practically all summer, she only just recently confirmed she's expecting her first child.

And Emma Roberts looked radiant as she finally showed off her baby bump on Tuesday, in a bright and colorful dress while out getting a cold coffee in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles, California.

The Scream Queens star, 29, covered the top half of the lovely white, blue, red and orange dress with a simple white t-shirt, which was either cropped or knotted and bunched up over her growing belly.

Emma's slightly retro dress looked to strapless, featuring a sweetheart neckline underneath the tee.

The American Horror Story actress kept the nostalgic and colorful theme going in her outfit with cute reddish cat-eye glasses, and red kitten heel slides with a bow applique.  

As always, Roberts masked up with her Ahida Correale face covering in blue and white saying the words, 'Wear It'.

She also carried a tan Fendi purse.

Emma, who is expecting her first child, a boy, with boyfriend Garrett Hedlund, confirmed the news via her Instagram just last week.

On August 30th, the actress posed in a trio of shots in a lovely polka-dotted white strapless dress, seated on a window bench.
