Karl Stefanovic has revealed his bold - or rather, bald - new look. 

In an Instagram post shared on Saturday, the Today host shared a photo in which he appeared to be sporting a clean-shaven head and a beard.

The 46-year-old, who appeared to be out a restaurant in the picture, wrote in the caption: 'I just dropped three kilos. See ya Monday.'
