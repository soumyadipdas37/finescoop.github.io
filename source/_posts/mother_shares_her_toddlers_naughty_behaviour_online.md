A mother who documents her three-year-old son's naughty antics online admitted she simply 'takes a photo and gets on with her day' when he misbehaves. 

Steffi Rox, 37, from Torquay, Devon, shares photos of her toddler Romeo, smashing mugs, smearing toothpaste on furniture, to chucking crisps and cereal all over the floor, to her personal Instagram account. 

The mother-of-two appeared on This Morning today where she revealed that her son blames his mishaps on the family dog Freddie, but confessed that she doesn't usually punish Romeo for his behaviour, and simply cleans up after him. 

But viewers weren't amused by Romeo's antics, with one claiming his mother is 'rewarding bad behavior' while another claimed that laughing at him being naughty means he'll continue 'seeking attention'.

'Romeo has been a bit of a crazy one since he was born', said Steffi, 'He has been a handful since he as born, he just likes doing crazy things.' 

Referring to the family dog, she said: 'Poor Freddie, we've had him for just over a year and he gets the blame for everything.' 

She added: 'I've got so used to living in chaos, I tend to take a photo, make them tidy it up, if it's fixable, and get on with the day.' 

Viewers were quick to take to Twitter to share their views, with one writing: 'Encouraging precocious behaviour in front of the children.' 













Viewers weren't amused by Romeo's antics, with one claiming his mother is 'rewarding bad behavior' while another claimed that laughing at him being naughty means he'll continue 'seeking attention'

Another said: 'OMG he does them because his mother actually encourages and indulges this for her own attention-seeking ends. Anyone can see that.' 

'He's going to do it even more now he's getting attention and everyone's laughing', commented a third. 

A fourth added: 'Cool, rewarding bad behaviour on #ThisMorning.'  

Steffi, a community organisation director, has previously admitted that her youngest son is like a 'walking tornado', but that she finds his behaviour 'quite funny'. 

'My eldest child Brody, eight, is so chilled and calm whereas Romeo is like a walking tornado', she said. 

Romeo has been documented by his mother getting into all sorts of disasters at their home in Torquay, Devon. Here he is pictured giving the freshly-painted grey living room wall a lick of green poster paint

No household item is safe around three-year-old Romeo, with his tendency to be destructive without even trying. Pictured surrounded by white polystyrene balls - most likely from an exploded beanbag chair

'He learns through doing things, for example realising some objects break if you throw them across the room - I don't even realise something is breakable until he touches it.

'He blames our dog, Freddie, for everything but the poor dog hasn't even done anything. It blows my mind how he can get the whole house covered in cereal or wet wipes. 

'I didn't have this wave of destruction with my other child so I find it quite funny putting the pictures together and looking back at what Romeo has done.'

Steffi has shown Romeo's cutlery and food mishaps but claims the worst thing she's pictured him doing was giving the freshly-painted grey living room wall a lick of green poster paint.

She said: 'He's very apologetic and says sorry when he's broken something - he's very cute with it, so it's hard to be mad at him.

Steffi says Romeo - pictured after throwing crisps on the floor - learns through doing things: 'For example realising some objects break if you throw them across the room - I don't even realise something is breakable until he touches it.'

Another one bites the dust: As well as painting walls and destroying furniture, Romeo has a tendency to smash mugs

Steffi, a community organisation director, has previously admitted that her youngest son is like a 'walking tornado', but that she finds his behaviour 'quite funny'

'I'm still waiting for him to cake himself in Sudocrem at some point, but he seems to have skipped that stage and gone on to do more destructive things.'

After Steffi began posting her photographic journey through Romeo's path of destruction, the account began gaining hundreds of followers - something which she didn't expect.

Steffi added: 'Brody has just started an Instagram to document his fishing hobby and he's very upset that he's doing a lovely sport and got no followers but Romeo's page almost has 1,000.

'There's a lot of comments from other mums who say that they've been in similar situations to me and they're very understanding.

'It's just something that other parents can relate to and laugh about in retrospect - it's all a bit of fun.

'I'm hoping to embarrass Romeo with the pictures and videos when he's 18 and show him how untidy he made the house when he was little.'
