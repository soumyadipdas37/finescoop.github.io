Trader Joe's has debuted a new cookie butter flavored beer, which has just hit shelves.

The grocery store chain announced in June that it would be bringing Speculoos Cookie Butter Beer to stores, and tasty new concoction is officially available to buy.

An imperial golden ale, the beer is made with toasted coconut, vanilla beans, and other natural flavors, according to the label — and has an alcohol content of 9.5 per cent ABV.

Yum! Trader Joe's has debuted a new cookie butter flavored beer, which has just hit shelves

Dessert brew: It's inspired by their beloved cookie butter and is said to pair great with cookie butter desserts

The product description says the new beer is 'made with whole vanilla beans, milk, sugar, and toasted coconut.'

'This full-bodied ale pairs with just about any treat topped with your favorite deliciously unusual Cookie Butter spread from our friends at Trader Joe's.'

According to the Inside Trader Joe's podcast, the beer took two years to develop, with the final product being the 18th version of the brew.

'It originally started off as a porter base, but you really couldn't taste the cookie butter at all or really pick up on the aromatics,' said Trader Joe's Product Developer Catherine Rhodes. 'So we switched over to an Imperial ale and that was really the trick to making it work. It's 9.5% ABV and it tastes just as good as what we have in the jars.'

According to the podcasters, the beer isn't one most people would think to drink while mowing the lawn.

'I would have it as an after dinner dessert beer and you could pair it with anything with cookie butter on top of it,' Rhodes said.

'I might give it the Elvis treatment. I might have cookie butter with banana slices and the Cookie Butter Beer on the Speculoos Cookies,' added Trader Joe's Vice President of Marketing Matt Sloan. 

So far, a few shoppers have managed to get their hands on the new beverage. 

'At first, it tasted like drinking a cookie butter candle, but after a few sips it seems to mellow out,' wrote the Candy Hunting Instagram account. 

'The flavor is remarkably close to cookie butter. Also, this bad boy clocks in at 9.5% ABV, but doesn't taste like it at all. It's definitely worth trying if you're into beer and cookie butter. '

Also hitting shelves this fall are a Ginger Bread Spiced Stout and a Toasty Cookie Spice Cider. 

'They're using really warm winter spices, so cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and clove. And the one thing that's really important to point out about the cider is it's a 100% fermented apple juice. It's not from concentrate,' added Rhodes.

A new Coffee Peanut Butter Cup Porter will also hit stores by Halloween.
