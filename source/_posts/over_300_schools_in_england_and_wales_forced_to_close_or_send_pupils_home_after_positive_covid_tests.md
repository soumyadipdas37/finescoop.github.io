Thousands of students are having their return to school curtailed because of coronavirus outbreaks in the classroom.

More than 330 schools in England and Wales have either shut completely or sent some class groups home after receiving positive test results.

Pupils in Scotland had all returned by August 12, and they are also dealing with a number of outbreaks.

And Northern Ireland schools were back in classrooms on August 31, despite a survey from NI's largest teaching union saying a majority of staff 'feel anxious and stressed' about returning.

Jim Blakely, head at Garstang St Thomas' School, told the Today programme: 'At the moment I've got two members of staff not here.

'My Year 4 teacher was sent home last Wednesday due to Covid symptoms, a persistent cough, but there were no tests available on Wednesday.

'So he kept trying to book during the day and in the evening, and there was some test available in some strange places, and these are the same places that parents in my school have been directed to like Aberdeen and Llandudno.

'Not only are they miles away, but they are in Wales and Scotland. There is very little local testing.'

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said disruption to pupils' education could worsen in the months to come.

'While only a small number of schools have had to close because of outbreaks, we are regularly hearing reports of groups of pupils and staff having to self-isolate in response to positive cases.

'The concern is that this disruption will worsen as winter approaches.'

He also warned that the work of schools and colleges in reopening to all students is being undermined by widespread problems in accessing Covid-19 tests.

'Even when tests have taken place this was not the end of the problems. Some leaders reported that it was taking three days or more for test results to be returned, and when there were positive Covid cases, a number said they had experienced difficulty in getting through to local health protection teams for guidance and support,' he said.

Downing Street have said that the vast majority - around 99 per cent - of schools have reopened as planned this month. 

'There is a very small number of schools which have asked some or all of their pupils to remain at home,' they said. 

'Children who are self-isolating continue to receive remote education from home.'

Here is a list of all schools in England and Wales known to have been affected by a positive coronavirus test:
