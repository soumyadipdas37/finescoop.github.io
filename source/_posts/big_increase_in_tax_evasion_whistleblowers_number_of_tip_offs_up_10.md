The number of whistleblowing reports about potential tax evasion have surged by 10 per cent. 

Around 73,000 tips were sent online to HM Revenue & Customs in the year to March 31 – up from 66,000 in 2019.

Accounting group UHY Hacker Young, which compiled the data, said the rise was partly down to tax evasion increasingly being seen as unacceptable behaviour.

Around 73,000 tax evasion whistleblowing reports were sent online to HM Revenue & Customs in the year to March 31 – up from 66,000 in 2019

Another factor is likely to be tighter rules on accountants and other advisers to report all possible cases. 

The figures are expected to increase dramatically in the wake of the furlough scheme.

Thousands of reports have already been sent in alleging employers have fraudulently claimed furlough money. 

Sean Glancy, of UHY Hacker Young, said: ‘It appears that more people than ever are choosing to report a neighbour, employer or business partner for tax evasion.

‘The financial pressure some people have been under may have affected whether they report someone they know.’
