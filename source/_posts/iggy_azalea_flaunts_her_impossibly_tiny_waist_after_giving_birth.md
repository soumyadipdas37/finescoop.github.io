She gave birth to her son, Onyx, just four months ago.

And on Thursday, Iggy Azalea flaunted her incredible post-baby body in a series of pictures shared to Instagram.

The Australian rapper, 30, displayed her impossibly tiny waist in black corset, which clung tightly to her slender waist.

In the photos, the blonde bombshell highlighted her figure in the form-fitting top, which she paired with a slinky black skirt. 

She styled her long locks in a messy updo styled with a rockabilly head scarf.

Iggy looked glamorous with flawless foundation, winged eyeliner and nude lips, and accessorised with large hoop earrings.

It comes just four months after the singer welcomed her first son, Onyx.  

Iggy, whose real name Amethyst Amelia Kelly, confirmed via social media in June that she had become a mother.

She took to her Instagram Story in June to announce the news, which had been the subject of speculation since April.

'I have a son. I kept waiting for the right time to say something but it feels like the more time passes the more I realize I'm always going to feel anxious to share news that giant with the world,' she wrote.

'I want to keep his life private but wanted to make it clear he is not a secret & I love him beyond words.' 

While she hasn't confirmed it, the child's father is believed to be her long-term boyfriend, rapper Playboi Carti.
