She tied the knot to the love of her love of her life in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance.

And Olivia Bowen and her husband Alex pulled out all the stops to celebrate their second wedding anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London on Tuesday evening. 

The Love Island star, 26, looked sensational as she slipped into a clingy pink dress while posing up a storm alongside her hunky man, 29.

Highlighting her killer figure, the former sales executive stunned in the light-coloured ensemble, which featured a daring thigh-high slit.

The reality star boosted her frame in a pair of nude pointed heels, while keeping accessories to a minimum. 

Bouncy waves framed her striking features, which were enhanced with matte foundation, false lashes and nude lipgloss.

Ex-scaffolder Alex ensured he didn't let his woman down in the style stakes as he looked sharp in a black shirt, wide-leg trousers and matching boots. 

Their solid relationship has gone the distance after they first got together in 2016, and are one of the rare Love Island romances that have not fizzled out. 

When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.

'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.

'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.

'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.'
