She is expecting her first child, with fiance Beau Clark, later this year.

The 32-year-old added a beige blazer over her dress, and teamed the look with a black shoulder bag in hand and black slide on loafers. 

She layered necklaces for simple touches, with a pearl choker, a long sold round pendant and a gold initial 'S' resting on her chest. 

Stassi was sure to cover up in a white and black striped face mask while heading out of the store, amid the coronavirus pandemic.

While waiting to cross the street she cradled her baby bump while chatting with a friend. 

Stassi seems to have just passed the six month mark in her pregnancy after dating her bump at '20 weeks' in mid August. 

Along with her fiance Beau, she shared a photo to Instagram on June 23 to officially announce they were expecting a bundle of joy.  

The photo saw the former reality star cradle her growing bump while getting a kiss from fiance on her cheek.

'We're having a baby girl,' she captioned adding two pink love hearts. 

A representative for Stassi and Beau confirmed to DailyMail.com in June that they were expecting their first child together in early 2021.

'Stassi and Beau will be welcoming their first child the first week in January and are grateful and eager to begin the next chapter of their lives as parents,' her rep, Steve Honig, revealed.

The blonde beauty started dating the casting agent towards the end of 2017 and they became engaged in July 2019.  

The couple were planning a wedding in Rome, Italy, in October but she revealed last month it will probably take place in 2021 instead due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Bravo cameras were expected to capture the ceremony, which would have been aired on season nine of the show, before Stassi was fired.

The baby news cames just days after she and Vanderpump Rules co-star Kristen Doute were fired from Bravo show after eight seasons for their past racist actions.

She revealed as one of the premiere week guests for Tamron Hall's second season, which debuts September 14.

Schroeder will appear on the Thursday, September 17 episode of Tamron Hall, according to the show's official website.
