Jason Sudeikis has hilariously revealed how his children have developed a passion for music.

Sudeikis, 45, appeared on Wednesday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he revealed son Otis, six, had started playing the drums and daughter Daisy, three, had found a love for singing.

'He's a little drummer boy,' Jason said. 'And Daisy's like the lyricist.'

Jason said Otis' love for drumming all started after he and fiancee Olivia Wilde bought him a drum kit at the start of the pandemic.

The actor joked they were 'idiots' for buying the instrument for their young child.

'We're idiot actors, we're artists, we don't know what we're doing,' he said.

'What's nice is he plays in rhythm, one drum at a time. He's no Dave Grohl quite yet,' Jason added.

'She sings all day': Jason called daughter Daisy the 'lyricist' of the family

Jason revealed their son played drums nonstop during a recent visit from his grandmother.

'The second she came in she just wanted to talk, "How's everything going?", and he just played the drums right through it. Just could not be bothered to listen or talk.'

Like Otis, his younger sister has also developed an interest in music.

'She sings all day,' Jason said. 'And all originals. No covers out of this kid. It's all original lyrics, original tunes, maybe something every now will sound like Into The Unknown from Frozen 2 or something, but I don't think we're in the copyright situation yet,' he joked.

Jason and Olivia have been engaged for seven years and together for a total of nine.

Jason recently revealed he waited to kiss Olivia for the first time because he had a feeling she was going to be the last person he ever smooched.

The actor was asked by All Access' Sibley Scoles if it was 'fact or fiction' that he waited 'one month to text Olivia for a date, and on the fourth date there was no kiss.'

'The majority of that is fact, yes. It might be five weeks or three weeks, but that's fact, yeah,' the Horrible Bosses star replied. 

'I just had a hunch that the second I kissed her, I wasn't gonna end up ever kissing anyone again, so I had to be careful with it.'

Nowadays, Jason has returned to his role of an American football coach who begins coaching a professional soccer team in London.
