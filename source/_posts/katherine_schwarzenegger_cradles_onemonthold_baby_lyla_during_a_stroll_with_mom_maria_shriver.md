Katherine Schwarzenegger and newborn daughter Lyla were seen out for their first time in public on Sunday.

The author wife of Chris Pratt looked like a doting mom while strolling around Santa Monica with her own mother Maria Shriver.

The second generation celebrity, 30, carefully cradled her five-week-old princess' head during the walk, where she kept the baby safe and secure in a Baby Bjorn carrier strapped to her front.

Oh baby! You could catch just of hint of Lyla's face during the stroll

Katherine was the image of mom-chic style donning a forest green hoodie and black leggings for the outing. She accessorized with cat-eyed glasses and pinned her hair back with an shimmering alligator clip in a lime hue.

Meanwhile, mom Maria kept up the faith donning a Virgin Mary tee shirt with her own slick leggings. She tossed a denim jacket on once things got cold.

While Katherine definitely seemed like she was in a protective mode, her journalist mom Maria, 64, couldn't hide her glee - even behind her California state-mandated face mask.

Katherine and movie star husband Chris, 41, announced the birth of their baby girl on August 10, taking to Instagram to share a sweet photo of the parents holding their newborn's tiny hand.

'We are beyond thrilled to announce the birth of our daughter, Lyla Maria Schwarzenegger Pratt,' Pratt said. 'We couldn’t be happier.' 

'Both mom and baby are doing great. We are extremely blessed,' he continued, signing off: 'Love Katherine and Chris.'   

Katherine' brother Patrick first confirmed the birth to ET days prior during a visit to a market in Santa Barbara, CA.

'They're doing great -- just got her a little gift,' said the 26-year-old actor, who could be seen 'carrying a package with a pink ribbon.'  

The couple's pregnancy was confirmed by Maria on May 1, when Pratt appeared as a guest on her Instagram Live series #HomeTogether.

'You're gonna have another beautiful family member,' said Shriver to Pratt at the time.

Days later, Katherine was spotted for the first time with a visible baby bump, while out walking her dog.

Though this is Schwarzenegger's first child, Pratt already shares a seven-year-old son Jack with ex wife Anna Faris, 43.

News of Katherine's pregnancy came just 10-months after her wedding to Chris, which took place in June of 2019 during 'an intimate ceremony' in Montecito, California.

He had proposed to Katherine in January of that year, less than a year after they began dating in June of 2018.

Chris and Katherine were first linked in 2018, after they were spotted canoodling in Santa Barbara, CA.  

The couple did not confirm their relationship status until December of 2018, a little over a month after Chris' divorce from Anna was finalized, as reported by E! News.

Only months prior, Chris filed for divorce from Faris after eight-years of marriage, citing 'irreconcilable differences,' according to TMZ. 

They asked for joint custody of their son Jack who was five-years-old at the time.
