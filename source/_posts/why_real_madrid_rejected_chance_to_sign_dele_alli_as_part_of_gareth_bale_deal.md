Zinedine Zidane rejected the chance to bring Dele Alli in on loan as part of the deal to take Gareth Bale back to Tottenham because of the comments the player made in 2017, according to reports in Spain.

With Bale on the verge of completing his stunning return to White Hart Lane, it is reported that Alli was offered up to Real Madrid in a bid to supplement the Welshman's mammoth £500,000-per-week wages.

However, according to AS, Zidane vetoed the move after he was left furious over Alli's comments in 2017 that he 'should've scored a hat-trick' in Spurs' 3-1 win over Real in the Champions League.

Zinedine Zidane reportedly vetoed the move as he would rather turn his attention elsewhere

The 24-year-old bagged a brace in the impressive group-stage win for Mauricio Pochettino's side, which saw Tottenham conquer the reigning European champions at Wembley.

After the match, Alli insisted that he should've had three goals to his name, saying: 'I'm disappointed I didn't get the hat-trick to be honest. I had an easy chance at the end from a great ball in by Kieran [Trippier].' 

The report claims Zidane resented Alli's comments, claiming his brace was not that impressive – with one of the goals deemed offside and the other a deflection.

Zidane also pointed out how his side was hit by several injuries on that cold Wednesday night in north London.

Spanish news outlet AS go on to claim that Alli's £100,000-a-week wages also proved to go against him, with the Spanish champions looking to free up space on their wage bill when they eventually make a move for Kylian Mbappe.

Zidane is a long-term admirer of his compatriot and is hoping to lure the PSG superstar to the Bernabeu next summer.

However, along with a hefty price-tag, Real will need to stump up big wages to get Mbappe on their books.

Alli looks set to stay at Tottenham this summer as Jose Mourinho looks to ship out other deadwood in order to fund their £27million move for Sergio Reguilon.

Juan Foyth, Paulo Gazzaniga and Danny Rose are all expected to be offered up in order to balance the books.

Serge Aurier, who has been linked with AC Milan this summer, will also be allowed to leave if the right offer comes in for the right-back.
