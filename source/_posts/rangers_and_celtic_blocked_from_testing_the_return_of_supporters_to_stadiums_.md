Rangers and Celtic have been blocked from testing the return of fans to grounds until new coronavirus restrictions covering Glasgow are lifted.

Rangers' home match with Dundee United a week on Saturday was earmarked as one of three pilot events scheduled for the weekend of September 12.

The Scottish Government have signalled a willingness to consider the phased return of supporters to all top flight grounds in incrementally increased numbers if the move proves successful.

While Celtic's trip to Dingwall to face Ross County could be given the go ahead to host a limited number of fans this week, however, Rangers plans to accommodate supporters for the home game against Dundee United have been vetoed after a further 86 coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area on Wednesday.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon put a block on residents of Glasgow City, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire visiting other households on Tuesday.

And a Scottish Government spokesman said last night: 'We are engaged with representatives from a range of sporting bodies for a small number of pilot events to examine the feasibility of having spectators in stadia and planning has been underway for a number of months to allow this to happen.

'Discussions are still underway and further updates will be provided to stakeholders in due course but we are clear no proposed test events will take place within the three council areas for the duration of the restrictions..'

Celtic's plans for a test event against Motherwell last Sunday have already been turned down by the Scottish Government and, until the latest measures affecting Glasgow are lifted, face further frustration.

Scottish football has already been handed a yellow card following high profile incidents involving players from Aberdeen and Celtic. 

The SPFL still hope that an alternative game to Rangers v Dundee United could still admit supporters, however, with other options on September 12 being Aberdeen v Kilmarnock, Livingston v Hamilton, Motherwell v St Johnstone and St Mirren v Hibs.
