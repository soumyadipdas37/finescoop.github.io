The Voice alum Jordan Pruitt announced her baby bliss on Thursday after welcoming her first child into the world with fellow Voice contestant Brian Fuente, 37.

Taking to Instagram to share the news, the 29-year-old singer could not help but smile at her little daughter.

'Olivia West Fuente. Welcome to the world. Our hearts are so full of love and gratitude. We are SO in love with you, baby girl' she wrote. 

Baby bliss: Voice alum, Jordan Pruitt, 29, took to Instagram Thursday to share that she and husband Brian Fuente, 37, had just welcomed their new daughter, Olivia West into the world. The couple who have been married for five years met after both appearing on The Voice

In the snap, Pruitt could not wait to cradle their beautiful new daughter as she cozied up to Olivia in the hospital with her IV still intact. 

She held her tiny head that was enveloped in a blue and pink striped cap as the newborn was wrapped in a colorful baby blanket. 

The singer kissed Olivia's tiny face, holding her precious gift close, as she looked in absolute heaven to be holding her newborn after nine months.

Sharing in the parental ecstasy, husband Brian also posted a photo of their daughter's hand as it grasped his finger. 

'Forever changed': Brian shared a sweet photo of his tiny baby girl's hand as it gently wrapped around his finger 'my life is forever changed by you baby girl' he wrote

'My life is forever changed by you baby girl. Welcome to the world Ms. Olivia West Fuente,' he wrote.  

News of the musical couple's pregnancy was made public in April on Instagram as they shared they had been 'keeping a secret'. 

In June the pair shared a photo holding a pink balloon with Brian announcing that he was going to be a 'girl dad', documenting every stage of Jordan's pregnancy on social media. 

The Nashville based couple first met back in 2013 after both had appeared on The Voice on seasons two and three.

Pruitt who was a part of Team Christina in 2012 was eliminated, but decided to embark on a country music career before retiring from music in 2017. 

Fuente appeared on the second season and was coached by Blake Shelton, but was also eliminated in the competition.  

The two tied the knot in May 2015 and shared a honeymoon in the Dominican Republic before returning back to the south to start their life together.  

The couple who frequently share sweet tributes to each other expressing their devotion, have now made their family three. 

Praising her husband Pruitt shared 'Never knew this kind of happiness existed until I met my future husband. He accepts my faults, loves my flaws and loves me exactly how I am. Thank you God for such an awesome man to spend forever with, i love you.'

 Three years ago the couple tabled singing, to embark on a new endeavor -  a mobile bartending operation called The Aero Bar -  which services Nashville, north Texas and Atlanta. 

'We've played a lot of different roles over the years...but my favorite role is being your best friend' sharing that she cannot wait to embark on parenthood with him. 

The happy news certainly brightens a triggering month. Only a year ago, Pruitt filed a lawsuit in against her former manager Keith Thomas who she accused of sexually abusing her when she was just 14. 

Taking Hollywood Records and their parent company Disney to task, Pruitt shared the chilling details of the assault that occurred for two years when she was making her first records in 2007 and 2008. 

Pruitt who is seeking a jury trial is currently in the process of writing a book about her experience called 'Abuse Anonymous.'
