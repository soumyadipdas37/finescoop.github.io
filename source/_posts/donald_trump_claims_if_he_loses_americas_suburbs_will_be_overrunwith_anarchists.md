President Donald Trump raised the prospect of a dystopian future in the future if he fails to win reelection – hours after saying he held back warnings about the nature of the coronavirus to avoid sowing 'panic.'

Trump made the claim as one of a barrage of tweets Thursday as he fended off news of the release of excerpts from Bob Woodward's book. 

'The Democrats never even mentioned the words LAW & ORDER at their National Convention,' Trump wrote, of the convention that took place last month. 

President Donald Trump has repeatedly pointed to urban unrest and violence in an appeal to suburban voters

'That’s where they are coming from. If I don’t win, America’s Suburbs will be OVERRUN with Low Income Projects, Anarchists, Agitators, Looters and, of course, “Friendly Protesters.”

Trump has repeatedly been tweeting about the suburbs this summer and fall. In July he tweeted about 'Suburban housewives of America.' He also has warned that low-income housing poses a risk to suburbs.

Days ago, he tweeted: 'Suburban voters are pouring into the Republican Party because of the violence in Democrat run cities and states. If Biden gets in, this violence is “coming to the Suburbs”, and FAST. You could say goodbye to your American Dream!'

Trump made 'law and order' a centerpiece of his convention, and regularly inveighs against violence at protests in Portland and Seattle, as well as violent crime in New York and Chicago.

President Trump tweeted that suburbs would be 'OVERRUN' if he loses the election

Polls have showed Democrat Joe Biden gaining ground in suburban congressional districts that went for Trump. The president faces a particular challenge with suburban college educated women, who have not taken to his rhetoric and tactics.

Biden holds leads in many key urban suburbs, while Trump holds an edge in more rural exurbs.  

His threats of formerly tranquil enclaves being over run by 'anarchists' and looters came hours after he justified his stark comments to Woodward about the coronavirus while holding back from the public.

'I'm a cheerleader for this country. I love this country. I don't want people to be frightened. I don't want to create panic,' Trump told reporters at the White House Wednesday. 

'Certainly I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show confidence. We want to show strength, we want to show strength as a nation. That's what I've done,' he said 'Leadership is about confidence. Confidence is confidence in our country,' he noted.

'Calm, no panic!' Trump tweeted earlier Thursday, standing by his position.  

Tape recordings and extracts from the veteran Watergate reporter's forthcoming bok Rage make a series of bombshell revelations.

CORONAVIRUS

Trump told Woodward o February 7 that coronavirus was 'deadly.' 

'You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus. This is deadly stuff,' he said - but did not tell the public what he knew

COVER-UP

On January 28, Robert O'Brien told Trump coronavirus 'will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,' and said: 'This is going to be the roughest thing you face.' Trump then told Americans it was 'under control' and would 'go away.'

And on March 19 Trump said:  'I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.' 

NORTH KOREA

Trump says Kim is 'far beyond smart,' and says that the dictator told him 'everything,' boasting about how he described the brutal execution of his uncle in a power struggle. 

Woodward reveals Kim Jong-Un's 'love letters' to Trump gushing to 'Your Excellency' about 'holding your hand' and calling their summit 'a fantasy film.'

But Woodward also reveals that when Trump was tweeting about 'Little Rocket Man' Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was so concerned about escalation that he slept in his clothes.

TRUMP ON THE MILITARY

'My f***ing generals are a bunch of p***ies,' Trump ranted in the Oval Office, and said their backing for NATO and an alliance with South Korea was 'stupid. Costs us $10 billion. We're suckers.'

...AND HIS PREDECESSORS

Trump said Woodward made George W Bush 'look like a stupid moron, which he was.' Of Obama he ranted: 'I don't think Obama's smart ... I think he's highly overrated. And I don't think he's a great speaker.' And he added that Kim Jong-Un called Obama 'an a**hol.'

WHAT AIDES SAID ABOUT HIM

Jim Mattis called him 'dangerous' and 'unfit,' went to pray in Washington National Cathedral, left government because he was 'basically directed to do something that I thought went beyond stupid to felony stupid' in reference to pulling troops from Syria, and suggested 'collective action' after leaving.

Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, had 'deep suspicions' that Putin had something on him and 'could not shake them.'

Dr. Tony Fauci called his leadership 'rudderless,' his attention span 'like a minus number' and said: 'His sole purpose is to get re-elected.'

Jared Kushner - his son-in-law - said Alice In Wonderland is the key to Trump, saying: 'If you don't know where you're going, any path will get you there.'

RACE RELATIONS

Trump described the term 'white privilege' as 'drinking the Kool-Aid' and repeated his claim he had done more for black Americans than Lincoln, adding: 'And, honestly, I’m not feeling any love.'

NUCLEAR SECRETS  

Trump used his private cellphone for late-night calls and revealed he had a 'weapons system' which Putin and Xi did not know about.
