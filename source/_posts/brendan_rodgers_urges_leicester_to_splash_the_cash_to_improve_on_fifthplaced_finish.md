Brendan Rodgers has urged Leicester to sign better players to have a chance of improving on last season's fifth-placed finish.

Since the end of the campaign, the Foxes have made only one senior signing, with full-back Timothy Castagne arriving from Atalanta in a £22million deal to replace Ben Chilwell, who moved to Chelsea for £50m.

St Etienne defender Wesley Fofana has begged his club to let him move to the King Power Stadium, with the French side demanding at least £27m for the 19-year-old.

And ahead of Sunday's trip to promoted West Brom, Rodgers is clear on the need to reinforce.

He said: 'The players showed huge potential and those players will hopefully go on to improve again this year. But also it is about quality and we need to improve the quality and depth of our squad.

'It was probably in that last period we lost some of our players of quality then in order to rotate we didn't have that necessary depth. It is an area we want to improve.

Rodgers says James Maddison may be fit enough for a place on the bench against West Brom

'We had some great moments last season and we just fell short of the Champions League. Only when the window is shut we will see where we can be. But there is no doubt going into the first game we are excited by the season. We want to be really competitive.' 

Leicester have not had James Maddison available since the 2-1 defeat at Everton on July 1 and the midfielder had surgery between the seasons, but Rodgers believes he may be ready for a place on the bench at The Hawthorns.

He added: 'I don't think he'll be ready to start considering the length of time he's been out and how often he's trained, but if he comes through training today/on Saturday he'll play a part in the game.'
