West Brom are looking to complete the signing of Wigan Athletic centre-back Cedric Kipre this week in a £900,000 deal. 

The 23-year-old also had an offer from Blackburn. 

Albion will discuss whether to pursue loan moves for Watford's Troy Deeney and Brighton's Shane Duffy this week. West Ham and Celtic are also interested in Duffy. 

West Brom are looking to complete signing of Wigan's Cedric Kipre in £900,000 deal

Kipre, formerly of Leicester City, was impressive last season and has attracted interest from a number of clubs. 

Crisis club Wigan sold Jamal Lowe to Swansea City on Thursday and have interest from Sheffield Wednesday in Josh Windass.

Wigan's administrators, Begbies-Traynor say there are four bidders at an advanced stage pushing to buy the club and its assets for around £4million. Two are UK-based and two are from USA.
