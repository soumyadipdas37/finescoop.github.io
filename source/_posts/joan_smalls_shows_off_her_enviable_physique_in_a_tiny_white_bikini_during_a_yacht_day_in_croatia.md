She's one of the most beautiful women in the world.

And, Joan Smalls showed off her enviable physique and glamorous curls as she posed in a tiny white bikini during a yacht day in Croatia, on Wednesday.

The Puerto Rican star, 32, looked incredible in the skimpy swimwear set, as she rested against the edge of the boat for a series of shots, which she posted to Instagram.

Joan struck a range of sultry poses, with her long brunette tresses falling down past her shoulders.

The model captioned the photographs with two lion emojis, as she showed off her wild side. 

One shot which she uploaded to her Stories, allowed Joan to fully display her endless pins in all their glory. 

Her glamorous getaway comes just weeks after she appeared to have confirmed she is dating Henry Junior Chalhoub - a year after the pair were presumed to be 'just friends'.

Last August, they were snapped on a luxury yacht looking incredibly cosy, but it was said their relationship was platonic.

But at the end of July, they stepped out in Portofino, Italy holding hands and enjoying a romantic stroll, seemingly clarifying their romantic status. 

Joan had been dating Modellounge founder Bernard Smith since 2011 - however they have not been pictured together since earlier in 2019.

They briefly split at the start of their relationship, but Bernard was able to win back her heart and the pair had been together since. 

Seen in Miami together in January 2019, things looked to be going strong between Joan and Bernard - with her posing for beach snaps while he played photographer.

They were seen cuddling up on a sun-lounger people-watching together, looking very at ease, but it appears that somewhere in early 2019, the couple called it quits. 

MailOnline approached Joan Smalls' representatives for comment at the time.
