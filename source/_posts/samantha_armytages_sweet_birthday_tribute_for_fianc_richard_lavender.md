Samantha shared two photos to Instagram of herself in the arms of her fiancé, with a diamond ring on her wedding finger. 

When she returned to Sunrise the following Tuesday, she told co-host David 'Kochie' Koch that Richard had proposed on the spur of the moment in the paddock of his country property.

Appearing in their Sexiest People issue, Samantha praised Richard as a 'decent' and 'very honest' man.  

She revealed they had been introduced by a mutual friend 'around Easter' and shared an instant connection. 

Samantha, who is notoriously private when it comes to her personal life, added that the most attractive thing about Richard is that he's 'comfortable in his own skin'.
