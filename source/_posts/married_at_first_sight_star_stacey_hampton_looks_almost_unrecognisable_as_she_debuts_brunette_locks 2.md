She is the icy reality star who is known for her perfectly coiffed blonde locks.  

But on Tuesday, former Married At First star Stacey Hampton crossed over to the dark side and debuted her new brunette tresses.

‘Insert inspirational quote here,' Stacey captioned the post, tagging her talented hairstylist.

As well as the hot new colour, Stacey was sporting a bouncy blow dry, which left her locks in loose curls that cascaded over her shoulders.

The former law student was also made up in glamorous makeup, featuring full coverage foundation, plenty of bronzer, defined brows and a soft pink lip.

The stunning new look for Stacey comes amid her latest legal drama.

Stacey was arrested in May and is now facing three charges of ignoring coronavirus restrictions on interstate trips.

Police arrested Stacey at Adelaide Airport on May 6 on her way back from Melbourne - after Instagram photos showed she was wasn't self-isolating.

The TV star played down the incident as 'a little hiccup' with her essential worker paperwork, at the time.

However, Daily Mail Australia can reveal Stacey was actually locked up for several hours and charged with two counts of failing to comply with a direction.

Police are believed to have told Stacey to go straight home and self-isolate - before they followed her after she left the police station.

They allegedly watched her pick up her her two sons Kruz, two, and Kosta, four, who were separately staying at her mother and friend's homes.

Officers then arrived at her house to give her a summons to appear on a third failure to comply with a direction charge.

'Currently waiting for the cops to come to my house and abuse me. Probably give me another fine,' she wrote in a text to a friend at the time.

She will face Adelaide Magistrates Court on October 30, facing fines of up to $20,000 and two years jail for each count.

At the time, essential travellers were allowed to enter SA and continue as normal. Non-essential travellers needed to self-isolate for 14 days.   

When asked on May 6 about reports she was stopped at Adelaide Airport by police, Stacey claimed it was all a misunderstanding.

She told Daily Mail Australia there was 'a little hiccup' at the airport due to state border closures, but insisted everything was 'fine' in the end.

'I had an essential workers clearance form, which they didn't realise I had, so I was fine. They had to look into my clearance, which was fine,' she said. 

'It was just over my form [and] whether or not it was essential. Then I proceeded to collect my son from school.'
