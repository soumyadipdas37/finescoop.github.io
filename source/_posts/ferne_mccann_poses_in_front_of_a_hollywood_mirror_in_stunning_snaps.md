Posing in front of a Hollywood mirror, Ferne fixed the camera with a sultry stare while she styled her locks into loose waves.

Alongside the post, she wrote: 'I focus on self care & self love. I try to worry less about what others may think. I keep a daily gratitude journal. 

'I SMILE as often as I can, to my friends, to strangers, to my daughter and to myself. I meditate...DAILY (even if it’s for a cheeky 5 mins)'. 

Ferne also shared heartwarming snaps of herself alongside her daughter Sunday, two, as they enjoyed a meal at Royal Rose Brentwood.

Ferne recently celebrated her 30th birthday in style by hosting a garden party complete with an incredible dance podium and five of her closest friends. 

She marked her milestone birthday at her farmhouse mansion in Essex with friends including fellow TOWIE stars Sam and Billie Faiers. 

It comes after new coronavirus restrictions placed a ban on more than six people gathering socially indoors or outdoors.

But the group still appeared to enjoy the festivities as they partied together in the garden surrounded by rolling fields.

In August Ferne jetted to the South of France for just one day after she had to cancel her birthday party due to Covid-19 restrictions.

Posting to Instagram, Ferne looked sensational in a lime green silk dress featuring a cowl neck and asymmetric hemline.

Captioning the video, Ferne revealed that she had just arrived back in London following a short stay in the South of France, adding that she scrapped plans for a birthday bash.
