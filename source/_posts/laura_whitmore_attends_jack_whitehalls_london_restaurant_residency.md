Laura Whitmore exuded glamour as she joined Lottie Moss and Roxy Horner for the launch of Jack Whitehall's London restaurant residency following his food blog. 

The TV presenter, 35, nailed autumnal chic as she stepped out in a tan fur-lined coat for the opening night of Jack's exclusive FoodS**t menu in collaboration with Provisioners at the Dixon Hotel, Tower Bridge. 

Laura attended the socially-distanced launch event alongside models Roxy, 29, and Lottie, 22, and the Came Here For Love hitmaker Ella Eyre, 26, on Thursday evening.

Meanwhile Roxy and Lottie showcased their model credentials as they posed on leather seats at the restaurant.
