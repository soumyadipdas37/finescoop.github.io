Sony has officially launched its £799 Xperia 5 II smartphone, which comes with 5G support and 4K slow-motion video recording.  

The new device, which is an update of the original Xperia 5 released last year, has been designed for photographers who want to 'capture cinematic masterpieces'. 

It includes the world’s first 4K HDR 120fps slow-motion video recording in a smartphone, which can can capture and playback up to 5x slow-motion when recorded at 24 frames per second.  

The phone is also 'built for gaming' with a 120Hz refresh rate – meaning the display refreshes 120 times a second for smooth on-screen action.

Xperia 5 II is described by the Japanese firm as the most compact Xperia ever, measuring 2.6 inches in width and just 0.3 inches in depth. 

It's been designed specifically for one-handed use – with a softer shape on the corners to fit more comfortably in the hand. 

The phone is available to pre-order in black and blue in the UK and Ireland and will be shipping from autumn 2020. 

The £799 Xperia 5 II is Sony's second 5G-compatible phone, following the high end £1,099 Sony Xperia 1 II, released earlier this year

'Sony’s heritage has been rooted in technology and engineering, and our portfolio has expanded to include the field of entertainment from music, movies, games and much more,' said Sony Mobile president Mitsuya Kishida. 

'With this unique background, Xperia smartphones are feature-packed with Sony's advanced technologies in a compact body, with a profound passion to push the boundaries of what is possible.' 

Xperia 5 II is Sony's second 5G-compatible phone, following the high end £1,099 Sony Xperia 1 II, released earlier this year.

Xperia 5 is intended to offer an alternative to its premium Xperia 1 range.

Just like its 'big brother', the new device uses AI technology from Alpha, Sony's camera brand, for 'razor sharp results'.

The AI-based 'Real-time Eye AF' system identifies and tracks the most expressive part of a subject's face, even animals, as they're moving. 

'Perfect portraits aren’t always posed and creating clear, spontaneous shots is where Real-time Eye AF comes into its own,' said Sony.

'Whether you’re photographing fast-moving people or animals, Real-time Eye AF makes sure the most expressive part of the face takes centre stage, even when one eye is covered or the person is moving quickly.'     

Besides always capturing clear photos, Xperia 5 II is 'a mobile gaming powerhouse'. with an ultra-responsive 120Hz refresh rate display.

240Hz motion blur reduction also updates a display's image 240 times per second for blur-free action. 

The phone is 6.2 by 2.6 by 0.3 inches but its compact size 'doesn’t make it any less powerful', Sony said. 

It has a 21:9 aspect ratio display, wider than conventional displays, revealing more of the action, which gives first-person shooter players an advantage, for example. 

The phone's gaming features have been developed with professional e-sports gamers to ensure the best experience, according to the company. 

Touch response has also been improved by 35 per cent compared with the original Xperia 5. 

As a bonus, users can connect a PlayStation 4 DualShock wireless controller and play Android games using the phone as the screen. 

Sony claims the 21:9 aspect ratio also makes it a good choice for film lovers who want to recreate the cinema experience in the palm of their hand. 

5G connectivity also means users can download and stream content on the go faster than ever.    

Xperia 5 II is tailor-made for one-handed use and has even been designed with a softer shape on the corners than its predecessor for a more comfortable feel 

Xperia 5 II has a modestly-sized 6.1-inch OLED display, triple rear 12 megapixel cameras and a high capacity 4,000mAh battery, and runs Android 10.

The triple lens camera has three focal lengths – 16mm, 24mm and 70mm – and lets users zoom in on distant subjects. 

Other features include a 3.5mm audio jack, 8GB RAM and front-facing stereo speakers. 

In terms of power, a fast charge capability charges the battery up to 50 per cent capacity in 30 minutes. 

Battery life has also been improved by 20 per cent compared to the original Xperia 5 – however, the device does not support wireless charging. 

'With a strong heritage in developing battery technologies to improve the battery lifespan, Sony can confidently say that Xperia 5 II will have a healthy battery even after two years of usage,' Sony said in a statement.  

The company also revealed release dates of its upcoming PlayStation 5 console late on Wednesday. 

Sony revealed the full design for the PlayStation 5 back in June but it's still yet to reveal an official word regarding a release date

The hotly-anticipated console will launch on November 12 in the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea.   

It will launch in the rest of the world, including the UK, on November 19. 

PlayStation 5 will be available in two models – one with a disc drive for £450 ($500) and the other, 'PlayStation 5 Digital Edition,' without a disc drive, for £360 ($400).
