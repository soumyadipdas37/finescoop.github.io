Britain's largest building society has launched another savings lottery, giving those who lock at least £100 away for 18 months a one-time shot at winning £10,000.

Launched a week after National Savings & Investments announced it would slash the number of non-£1million Premium Bond payouts from December as part of a range of cuts to its savings accounts, Nationwide's new 'mutual reward bond' will let existing customers stash away up to £10,000.

Saving into the 18-month fixed-rate bond comes with a rate of 0.5 per cent - this can be beaten by more than a dozen one-year fixed-rate accounts in This is Money's independent best buy tables.

It will see savers entered into a prize draw taking place at the start of next February.

Nationwide Building Society unveiled its third savings lottery of 2020. Savers have a shot of winning £10,000

There will be multiple £10,000 prizes up for grabs, with the total prize fund given away to savers based on 0.5 per cent of the total amount saved. Were £10million to be saved into the accounts, the prize fund would be £50,000, with five £10,000 prizes given away.

Savers will be entered into the draw once for each £100 saved, effectively giving them 100 'tickets' in the draw if they save the full £10,000.

Nationwide said someone who saved this much into the account would have 'at least' a one in 200 chance of winning one of the headline prizes, which suggests someone who saved the minimum £100 would have a 20,000 to one shot.

This compares favourably with Britain's best-loved savings lottery, NS&I's Premium Bonds, which handed out 71 prizes of £10,000 in this month's draw, although it was choosing from a far larger pool of savers.

With more than 94billion £1 Bonds in the September draw, the odds of any £1 Bond winning £10,000, the fifth-most valuable sum up for grabs, was 1.33billion to one.

Someone holding £100, the minimum needed to open Nationwide's lottery, would have a 13million to one chance of winning the prize, while someone who held £10,000 would have a 133,061 shot at doubling their money.

These odds are set to get even longer from December when NS&I makes cuts to its Premium Bonds.

It estimates there will be 43 prizes of £10,000 in the draw that month, 28 fewer than in September.

If the number of Bonds remained the same, the odds of any £1 Bond winning £10,000 would lengthen to 2.2billion to one, the odds of winning £10,000 with £100 worth of Premium Bonds to 21million to one, and the odds of doubling a £10,000 holding, 220,000 to one.

However, while the odds are shorter for Nationwide's draw, it is worth noting that the Premium Bonds draw takes place every month, savers can hold up to £50,000 worth and additions and withdrawals can be made without penalty at any time.

And even after NS&I's cuts come into effect, the 'effective prize fund rate', or the amount savers can expect to earn on their Premium Bonds holding over a year, remains twice the interest rate of Nationwide's 18-month bond.

Britain's largest building society has previously launched two prize draws in 2020. In February it unveiled a Start to Save account paying 1 per cent interest which entered those who saved between £50 and £100 a month over a three-month period into a quarterly prize draw, with prizes of £100 up for grabs.

The first draw in July handed out 458 £100 prizes after around £4.58million was saved between April and June.

Meanwhile a one-off Isa prize draw in May handed out 10 prizes of £20,000, 10 £10,000 prizes and 40 £5,000 prizes to savers who paid in £100 or more into a Nationwide Isa in the 2020-21 tax year.

And the world of savings lotteries became even more crowded at the end of last month when Epsom-based mutual Family Building Society brought back its Windfall Bond, giving those with £10,000 or more the chance of winning between £1,000 and £50,000.

It would give away up to 15,000 tickets bought in £10,000 instalments, allowing a total of £150million to be saved, with the monthly draw including two £10,000 prizes.

Someone with £10,000 would therefore have a one in 7,500 chance of taking home that prize.
