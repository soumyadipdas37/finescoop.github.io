Having a great time: Ireland spent time with her handsome boyfriend Corey Harper

Ireland shared two images of her bruised face along with the caption: 'Yesterday in the late afternoon, I was attacked by a woman who was high out of her mind on drugs and desperate for cash. She decked me in my face in a parking lot and took my belongings and jumped in a getaway car while her husband took off.'

'All was sorted by police and she was arrest. Luckily I had witnesses and got assisted really quickly. The cops told me this is happening frequently because people are desperate for money right now due to Coronavius and people being out of work,' she said.

'There is a lot of theft and muggings going down. Posting this to remind everyone to be really careful and watch your surroundings. These are really difficult times and we need to look out for one another,' Ireland concluded.
