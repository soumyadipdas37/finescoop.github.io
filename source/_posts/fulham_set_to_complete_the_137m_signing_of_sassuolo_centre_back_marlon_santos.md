Fulham will complete the £13.7million signing of Brazilian centre back Marlon Santos from Sassuolo pending his medical.

As Sportsmail reported on Monday, Barcelona had a buy back option for the 25-year old but declined to take it up paving the way for Fulham to conclude a deal.

Marlon is due in London in Thursday ahead of finalising terms.

Scott Parker is looking to bolster his defence after shipping goals against Arsenal and Leeds

Sassuolo kept five clean sheets in the 23 league games played by the defender last season with the club finishing eighth in Serie A. 

Fulham have suffered two defeats in their opening two Premier League fixtures and Scott Parker is looking to strengthen his squad before the end of the window.

Marlon would help bolster the Cottagers defence after they conceded seven goals across the two opening league games, with Arsenal scoring three before Leeds put four past them.

Fulham still want another defender and remain in talks over a deal for Red Bull Leipzig winger Ademola Lookman.

The winger has failed to become a regular at the Bundesliga side after completing a £16.5m transfer last summer.

Benfica midfielder Florentino Luis is also still on their radar though Southampton have also been offered the chance to sign the 21-year old on loan with view to a permanent £30m deal.
