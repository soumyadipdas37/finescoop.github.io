Meghan Markle's best friend Jessica Mulroney has broken her social media silence after quitting Instagram to share pictures working out in a gym. 

The stylist, 40, from Toronto, posted a snap on her Instagram stories as she leaned against a punching bag dummy, clad in skin-tight black gym gear, writing: 'Missed Igor and punching.'

Her post comes just one week after she announced she would be taking a 'much needed break' from social media for a few weeks to 'get some real work done'. 

Earlier this month she hit back at rumours that she and Meghan, 39, are no longer close by claiming the wife of Prince Harry, 36, is the 'kindest friend' who has 'checked up on me every day'.  

Meghan Markle's best friend Jessica Mulroney, 40, from Toronto, has broken her social media silence to say she 'missed punching' after enjoying a tough work out in a gym

Days ago, the stylist shared a selfie wearing a red suit and monochrome vest top on Instagram, captioning the post: 'Little girls night before a much needed break to get some real work done. See you in a few weeks.' 

She later changed the caption on the post to say she was taking a 'pause' so that she could 'finish an exciting project.' 

It was claimed in August that the Duchess of Sussex was reported to have cut ties with Jessica after black influencer Sasha Exeter accused her of 'threatening her livelihood' after 'taking offence' at a Black Lives Matter video posted by the online star.  

But in a new post, which was published on her Instagram story earlier this month, Jessica wrote:  'I'm going to tell this once and for all. Meghan and I are family.  

Her new post comes just one week after she announced she was taking a 'much needed break' for a few weeks to 'get some real work done'

She captioned a selfie to say she was going out for a 'little girls night' before adding she wouldn't be on the platform 'for a few weeks'

'She is the kindest friend and has checked up on me everyday. Tabloid culture is atrocious. It creates lies and hurtful storylines. Stop feeding into it. Done.'

Although her Instagram account has been set to private, the post was re-published by people.com. 



Because she has set her account to private, only Jessica's approved followers can read her posts. 

Her latest comments come after Jessica deleted an Instagram photo earlier this month of one of her twin sons, Brian, at Meghan Markle's wedding. 

The stylist made the claim in an Instagram post, just over two weeks after she deleted a throwback snap of one of her twin sons at Meghan's wedding

The post was thought to be to be a further attempt from Jessica to show she remains good friends with the former actress - who now lives with Prince Harry, 35, in Santa Barbara. 

Jessica and Meghan have been close friends for years, with the stylist's daughter a bridesmaid and Brian and his twin John serving as page boys at the Duchess's wedding to Prince Harry. 

But the mysterious disappearance of the photo from her Instagram page added fuel to the fire of rumours of a rift between the pair. 

Jessica then took to Instagram once again a week later to reveal that she sometimes deletes Instagram posts because she's 'tired' of looking at the amount of 'bullying and hatred' she's had to put up with for three years. 

Jessica shared a snap of one of her twin sons, Brian, at Meghan Markle's, 39, wedding at the beginning of this month, but deleted the snap the following week

The recent post read: 'People often ask why I delete certain posts. The amount of bullying and hatred I've had to put up with for three years...I'm tired of looking at it. Be kind. Be gracious. 

'We are grown ups...stop acting like teenagers. Real women don't put down other women.'

Mother-of-three Jessica returned to the social media platform on August 11 following a two-month break after the public rift with Sasha Exeter. 

A source told DailyMail.com at the time that Meghan was left 'mortified' by the scandal and informed her close friends she felt she could 'no longer be associated' with Jessica.

'Meghan is absolutely mortified that she's been dragged into this complete mess. She said Jessica is in no way a racist, but the way she handled the situation [with Sasha] was tone-deaf and heartbreaking,' a close friend of Meghan's said at the time.

'Meghan said friends reflect friends and because of what's at stake she can no longer be associated with Jessica, at least not in public. 

'She has to do what she has to do in order to preserve her dignity and her own reputation,' the source added, admitting that they 'wouldn't be surprised' if the controversy was the 'beginning of the end of their friendship'.

But earlier this month Jessica shut down the rumours, branding a commenter's suggestion on one of her posts that she had been 'dumped' by Meghan 'fake news'.
