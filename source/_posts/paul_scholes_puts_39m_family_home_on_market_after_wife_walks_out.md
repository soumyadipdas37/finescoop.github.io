Paul Scholes has put up his luxurious marital home for sale just weeks after his wife moved out and stopped wearing her wedding ring.

The modern seven-bedroom detached property which Scholes shared with his wife Claire and their three children is on the market for £3.8 million.

Described as one of the 'finest homes in Saddleworth,' Greater Manchester it lies close to where the United legend grew up on a council estate and comprises an indoor heated swimming pool; steam and sauna facilities, gym, home cinema room, games room as well as a five-a-side football pitch, netball court and a putting green.

It also has six reception rooms and an 'executive detached house' located within the landscaped grounds.

The lavish home was bought by Scholes soon after the 1998 World Cup but then underwent a complete refurbish and redesign by top architects in 2015.

Two months ago, it was reported that Claire had moved out of the home and was living 20 minutes away. 

She was also photographed without her wedding ring, prompting speculation the couple's marriage had hit the rocks.

Scholes, who is worth an estimated £27 million, and Claire are said to be 'devastated.'

A source said: 'You have to feel for them as they both value family above everything else. They've been together forever, and nobody saw this coming.'

Scholes met Claire in his local pub when they were 18 and they married six years later. He famously cited missing her as the reason for retiring from the England team in 2004, aged just 29 while at the peak of his career.
