Sydney and Geelong star Daniel Menzel has been charged with sexual assault over an alleged incident with a woman at Bondi Beach last year.

Menzel, 29, allegedly sexually touched the woman without consent in Sydney's east between 2.30am and 3.40am on November 23, 2019.

After an investigation, NSW Police charged him over the alleged assault on April 29. 

Menzel had been out with Sydney Swans teammates on the same night before the incident is alleged to have occurred.

Daily Mail Australia understands that in conversations with the woman he bragged to her about being an AFL player. 

The talented small forward had been delisted by the Swans just weeks earlier having been thrown a lifeline after an injury-interrupted career at Geelong.

Menzel burst onto the scene in 2011 and was a Rising Star nominee before injuring his ACL in Geelong's first final. 

It was the beginning of a horror stretch for the goal sneak, who did the same injury on another three occasions before finally managing to make his comeback in 2015.

Menzel once again established himself as a regular in the Geelong lineup, before he was unceremoniously sacked at the end of 2018.

Sydney offered him a lifeline but after just seven games in 2019 also delisted him.

The South Australian-born product signed a deal to play with Central Districts in the SANFL, but before that enjoyed a Sydney farewell with Swans players last November.

On November 22 he shared a photo to Instagram of himself with more than a dozen other other players embracing on a couch with beers in hand.

Among them were superstars Josh Kennedy, Dane Rampe and Isaac Heeney.

But police allege that in the early hours of the next morning Menzel sexually touched the woman.

A spokesperson for the Sydney Swans did not wish to comment on the matter and it is understood Menzel was not under contract with the club at the time of the alleged incident.

Menzel played a total of 80 games and kicked 143 goals across his 10-year career.

His matter was mentioned in Waverley Local Court on Tuesday afternoon but he did not appear in person and was represented by a lawyer. 

In a statement, NSW Police said: 'On the 29 April 2020, a then aged 28-year-old man was charged with sexually touch another person without consent in relation to an incident at Bondi in November 2019.'

'He is next due to appear at Waverley Local Court on Tuesday October 27, 2020.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Menzel and the Central Districts Football Club for comment.
