A proposed law could mean celebrities are banned from secretly photoshopping their pictures on social media to change their body shape. 

Tory MP Dr Luke Evans has drawn up a Bill which would mean celebrities would have to label images which have been digitally altered to change how they look. 

Dr Evans, a member of the Health and Social Care Committee and a GP, said that edited photos on social media were 'fuelling a mental health crisis' as it was creating a 'warped view' of beauty, The Sun reported.

Celebrities such as Lauren Goodger and Khloe Kardashian have been criticised for doctoring their photos on Instagram. 

Khloe Kardashian came under fire for 'heavily editing her face' in an Instagram photo after it was tweeted put side-by-side with a screenshot from a video interview. 

One user claimed Khloe's beauty mark next to her nose wasn't in the first picture, but was in the screenshot taken from the interview.

Another said they didn't think the photo was edited, but just used better focus and lighting. 

In another side-by-side comparison, Lauren Goodger, who was on The Only Way Is Essex, has been accused of altering her body shape. 

In the second image, it appears her thighs and ankles have been edited to look thinner. 

Last month, she was accused of editing a throwback picture of her and her father to alter how her face and hair looked before posting it to Instagram. 

It was clear the photo she posted had been edited after the original was unearthed in her 2013 autobiography, Secrets Of An Essex Girl.
