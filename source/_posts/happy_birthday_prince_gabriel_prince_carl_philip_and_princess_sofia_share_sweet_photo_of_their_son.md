Fans were quick to send their best wishes, with one person writing: 'Congratulations. He is so cute.'

Prior to his birthday today, Prince Gabriel, who is the second son of Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia, who also share four-year-old Prince Alexander, visited his duchy of Dalarna for the first time.

The young royal sported a bright green smock when painting to make sure his adorable outfit - a blue jumper over a white shirt - didn't get messy.

His parents appeared just as smart, with Princess Sofia opting for a brown coat and black trouser combo, while her husband sported a grey jumper with green chinos.

Prince Carl Philip, Princess Sofia and their two sons have spent their summer enjoying staycations - with the family exploring local nature spots through walking, biking and swimming.

Prince Gabriel, Duke of Dalarna, was born on August 31 in 2017 at Danderyd Hospital in Stockholm.

He was christened in a traditional ceremony in Stockholm in December and is sixth in line to the Swedish throne.
