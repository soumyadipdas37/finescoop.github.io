Boy George has hit back at reports that he was 'dumped' from The Voice Australia. 

The pop icon was responding to a story in New Idea that claimed that both he and Kelly Rowland were being dropped from The Voice, and replaced with local judges as the singing show moves from Channel Nine to Seven next year. 

'I've never been "dumped" by a network,' the 59-year-old tweeted on Monday, before adding: 'They can't afford me darling!'

After a concerned fan told George to 'hang in there', he sarcastically shot back: 'Yeah I’m down to my last jar of metaphorical caviar. Can I move into your spare bedroom?'

Channel Seven recently confirmed that its version of The Voice will be a 'more efficient and cost-effective production' than the show produced by Nine. 

And according to New Idea, the network 'are going for local coaches only, which means no more Kelly Rowland or Boy George, or overseas celebrities Zooming in.'

Due to the coronavirus pandemic and travel restrictions, Kelly and George recorded the second half of this year's season remotely via Zoom. 

But there reportedly won't be any visiting celebrities in 2021, with Aussie stars Jess Mauboy and The Veronicas' Lisa and Jessica Origliasso tipped for Seven's new panel.

Another candidate is singer, actor and YouTube star Troye Sivan, who producers hope will attract a younger demographic.

Seven is yet to confirm what will happen to incumbent Aussie judges Guy Sebastian and Delta Goodrem.

Delta, 35, is the longest-serving coach on The Voice Australia, having joined the line-up for its debut season in 2012.

It was reported last month that Nine had 'failed to renew its contract' for the 2021 season of The Voice, and Seven jumped on the licence 'very quickly'.

Channel Seven's CEO, James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.

Warburton already has big changes in mind for the show, including cutting the number of episodes and having a tighter production schedule.

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter time frame,' he said.

A Nine spokesperson said last month: 'Unfortunately due to the age of the show and declining demographic profile, The Voice had become by far the poorest financial performer on our slate.

'We wish Seven well in their quest to revive yet another Nine show.'

Darren McMullen and Renee Bargh, who presented the 2020 season, won't be returning next year. They have been replaced by Sonia Kruger, who used to host the talent show on Nine until she defected to Seven last year.
