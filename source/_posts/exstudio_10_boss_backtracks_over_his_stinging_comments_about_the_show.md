Studio 10's former executive producer labelled the new-look show 'a piece of s**t' with 'the depth of a puddle' on his podcast on Monday.

But on Tuesday, Rob McKnight, who oversaw day-to-day operations of Studio 10 from 2013 to 2017, completely backtracked on his harsh comments.

He published an apology on his TV Blackbox website and admitted he'd 'gone too far', adding that his former colleagues were upset by his comments.

'In the cold light of day, I look back at those remarks and I have regrets,' McKnight wrote. 

'It's one thing for me to disagree with the changes to Studio 10, but it's another to pour scorn on the people working hard behind the scenes to deliver four hours of television.

'You know you've gone too far when people you respect reach out to you to let you know.

'How arrogant people must think I am. So, because I made those comment publicly so I am going to apologise publicly. To all those people who work their a***s off each and every day – I am sorry.'

McKnight explained he'd made the comments because he was feeling 'emotional' that the show he'd worked on for four years had changed its format.

After seeing his comments published by Daily Mail Australia, he realised he had been too judgmental. 

He concluded his apology by saying it was time for him to 'move on'. 

McKnight also praised longtime Studio 10 host Sarah Harris and her new co-anchor Tristan MacManus, saying they make 'a great team'.

Rob's formal apology comes after he slammed the show on his TV Blackbox podcast on Monday.

'It was embarrassing. I swear to god, I wish that they had renamed the show because as far as I'm concerned Studio 10 is dead,' he said.  

'A piece of s**t, no matter how much you roll it in glitter, is a piece of s**t. It was woeful.'
