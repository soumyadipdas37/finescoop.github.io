A husband who murdered his wife 34 years ago and refused to reveal how he disposed of her body will have his prison release reconsidered.

Russell Causley was jailed for life for killing Carole Packman in 1985, a year after he moved his lover into their home in Bournemouth, Dorset.

The Parole Board had found while the 78-year-old's refusal to reveal the whereabouts of her remains was 'heartless', it did not increase his risk to the public.

But the family appealed based on his refusal to tell the truth, his behaviour in prison and his criminal past.

They received a huge boost today when they were told the Secretary of State had recommended the case should be reconsidered.

Decisions can be reconsidered if the release was deemed procedurally unfair or irrational.

Carole Packman disappeared from her family home in Bournemouth in 1985. 

Her daughter Sam Gillingham, then 16, came home from school to find a note, supposedly from her mother, along with her wedding ring. 

The letter said that she was leaving their family. 

The year before, Causley moved his lover Patricia Causley into the house and later changed his surname to hers.  

It wasn't until 10 years later, when Causley was jailed for two years for trying to fake his death in a boating accident that he was found guilty of her murder.  

He allegedly made a jail cell confession, telling of the 'perfect' murder of his 'b**** wife'. 

Police reopened their investigation into his wife's disappearance. 

Causley was convicted of murder in 1996, but it was quashed in 2003.  

In 2004, he was found guilty at a retrial after his sister said she had heard him admit the killing.    



Now aged 78, he was the first killer in British legal history to be found guilty without his victim's body ever being found.

The judgment was quashed by the Court of Appeal before a retrial was ordered in 2004, which saw Causley found guilty and jailed for the murder for a second time.

In recent years Causley has offered differing accounts on what he did with his wife's body before retracting them. He failed to get parole at a hearing in 2014. 

He is due to go before the Parole Board next month ahead of his possible release.

A specialist member of the Parole Board will now review the release and decide whether Causley needs a new hearing.

His daughter Sam Gillingham, 51, said: 'It's a small victory and we still have a long way to go.

'Whether we are going to get this judgement overturned I do not know. But at least it's a start to keeping him behind bars.

'How can a man, who murdered my mother and has never told us the truth after all of these years, be considered safe to be released.

'I've always said that if he had shown remorse, it would be different. But not once has he offered to tell the truth about what happened to my mother, to me - his daughter.

'He's changed his story time after time. How can the heartless Parole Board let him out?

'Everything they said he needed to do, in terms of truth and reconciliation, he hasn't done.'

Causley was granted release in September after spending 24 years behind bars and twice offering confessions to what happened to Carole.

But Dorset Police later investigated these claims and found them both times to be false.

Ms Gillingham and her son Neil, 30, believe the murderer should not be released due to a lack of rehabilitation.

In a detailed seven-page statement they explained their fears he would be a threat to society, due to his long criminal history.

While in prison he had threatened to murder his 'b***h' daughter and he had previously killed two dogs, among a litany of offences.

They also pointed out Causley had not taken part in any prison rehabilitation classes and his prison psychiatrist and probation officer both recommended he was moved to open prison.

Neil said: 'We are closer than ever before to seeing that twisted, deviant killer being freed.

'While Causley's release may seem imminent, if we win this appeal we will set another legal landmark.

'This will hopefully give faith to other families - who have had information about their loved ones' murders held back - and a template to help.'

Ms Gillingham was just 16 when Carole, then 40, went missing from their home in Bournemouth, Dorset. Causley told his daughter at the time: 'She'll be back.'

Causley got away with the murder for 10 years until he was jailed for trying to fake his own death in an insurance scam.

He allegedly told a cellmate about the 'perfect' murder of his 'b**ch wife', leading to him being found guilty of her murder in 1996.

Russell Causley has offered differing accounts throughout the years on what he did with his wife's body before retracting them.

Sam Gillingham, 51, said every new tale Causley spins is just more torture for her and her family.

One of the accounts he gave was that he hit her with an axe and then disposed of her body in acid.

Another time he said he struck her over the head and then strangled her before burning her body in his back garden.

He later said that he'd buried her and then retracted the statement.

Causley  has now said that he strangled her and burned her body over the course of several days.

In December last year, Causley's former cellmate alleged that Causley used to mention Romney Marsh.

In 2003, this was quashed as his alleged confession was deemed unsafe, but in a retrial the next year he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.

He has been behind bars ever since, yet has still never revealed what happened to Carole.

The provisional release has been issued despite Helen's Law, which is intended to stop 'no body' murderers from being granted release.

It is named after Helen McCourt, who was murdered in Merseyside in 1988 by pub landlord Ian Simms.

Simms, who never told Helen's grieving mother Marie what happened to her body, was released earlier this year.

Mrs McCourt appealed the decision, with the Secretary of State's backing, yet the killer was still released.

Ms Gillingham and Neil have also been passionate campaigners for Helen's Law.

The Disclosure of Information About Victims, which forces the Parole Board to take into account whether the convict has withheld information, has already been passed by the House of Commons.

When Causley was granted release, a Parole Board spokesman said: 'Parole Board decisions are solely focused on what risk a prisoner could represent to the public if released and whether that risk is manageable in the community.

'The panel carefully examined a whole range of evidence, including details of the original crime, and any evidence of behaviour change, as well as understood the harm done and impact the crime has had on the victims.

'The Parole Board has a huge amount of sympathy for families of victims who have never been found and appreciates the pain and anguish this causes.

'The panel is, however, bound by law to focus solely on whether an offender's continued detention is necessary for the protection of the public.

'Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority.'

A Parole Board spokesman today confirmed an application for a reconsideration had been received from the Secretary of State.
