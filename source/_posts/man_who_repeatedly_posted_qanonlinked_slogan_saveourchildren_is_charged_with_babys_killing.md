Joshua Jennings, from Yukon, was initially charged with child abuse but the charge was later upgraded to first-degree murder

A QAnon conspiracist from Oklahoma who repeatedly shared and posted the pro-life hashtag #saveourchildren, has been charged with killing his girlfriend's infant daughter. 

Joshua Jennings, from Yukon, was initially charged with child abuse but the charge was later upgraded to first-degree murder after the baby died at the hospital on Saturday. 

Jennings was arrested on Friday after the baby, 10-month-old Paisley Cearly, was taken to the emergency clinic by her mother on Friday, KFOR reports.

Medical professionals at the clinic called authorities after discovering that the infant had sustained multiple significant injuries while in the care of Jennings.

There was evidence of older injuries on the child as well. Police would not reveal what the nature of the injuries were until they received an autopsy from the medical examiner. 

The baby died on Saturday.

'Upon talking to the doctor, there's no way the injuries could have occurred accidentally,' said Oklahoma City Police Msgt. Gary Knight.

The abuse was said to have occurred near SW 5th St and Mustang Rd in Oklahoma City.  

'Upon interviewing the man, Joshua Jennings, he was then booked into the Oklahoma County jail on a complaint of child abuse. The child later died so that charge would be amended to reflect murder in the first degree,' Msgt. Knight added.

According to his Facebook page, Jennings is an ardent Trump who has spoken out against athletes kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality. He has also expressed disdain for fake news.

But Jennings has dedicated a number of post to the #SaveOurChildren, advocating against harming children and condemning pedophilia.  

'Someone said to me "your hard on your kids"... Yeah and that's why they aren't little a**holes,' a post Jennings shared on September 14 reads.

An August 12 post reads: 'Y'all know I don't get on here and post much any more. One, because life has been crazy with work, moving, etc. And two, because I don't feel the need to live my life on social media. However... This #SaveOurChildren movement train I will GLADLY hop on. Blow it up on my page if you feel froggy.'

#SaveOurChildren has gained prominence among the QAnon community, who claim that Democrats, Hollywood elites and members of the Jewish elite are kidnapping minors for sexual rituals to extend their lives. 

Pizzagate occurred after Edgar Maddison Welch stormed a DC pizzeria believing there was an underage sex ring being ran by Bill and Hillary Clinton. 

'This fight against this belief that the Hollywood elites or whoever the conspiracy theorists are blaming for this big huge pedophile rings, it’s just a distraction from the real issue that’s happening to real children,' Texas Center for the Missing CEO Beth Alberts said, Reform Austin. 'Our time is being eaten up telling people to check their sources.'
