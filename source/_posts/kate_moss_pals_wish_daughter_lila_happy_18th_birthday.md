On Kate's modelling agency Instagram page she shared an old snap of herself cuddling her young daughter, alongside the caption: 'Happy 18th birthday Lila. We love you.'

Kate returned to London last month after she had been isolating in her Cotswolds mansion with Lila alongside her long-term partner Count Nikolai and her half-sister Lottie, 22.

The troupe were also joined by Kate's hairdresser friend James Brown.

A source told MailOnline: 'Kate and James have been friends their entire careers, they're like family. They're very comfortable living together.

'It's an added perk that James is a hairdresser and has been able to lend his hand when it comes to overgrown roots and out of control hair.

'Lottie, who's dyed her hair pink in lockdown, has also formed a close bond with James – and regularly shops with him when getting food for the house.'

 Happy 18th Birthday Lila, we love you¿¿¿¿
