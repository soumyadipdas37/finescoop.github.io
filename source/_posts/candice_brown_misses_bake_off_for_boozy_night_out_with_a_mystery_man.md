Candice has kept a close friendship with her former Dancing On Ice 2018 professional partner, Matt Evers.

The duo regularly shares snaps of each other to their Instagram accounts with Matt, 44, even calling her his 'ride or die'.  

Candice's appearance comes after her estranged husband Liam Macaulay was revealed to be looking for love on the dating app Bumble.

Last month, Liam's profile could be seen on the popular app where women must message men first.

His foray into the world of online dating came just five weeks after he jetted off to Mykonos, Greece with mother-of-one Micah Taffurelli, days after confirming the end of his marriage to Bake Off star Candice. 

On his Bumble profile, the tree-surgeon, 34, said he is 'looking for a relationship and wants children someday', reports The Sun. 

Liam also says that he is a 'great plus one' because he is 'Scottish, 6ft 2ins and has a pug called Dennis'.

He also added that a non-negotiable factor for him in choosing a partner is that 'you have to like dogs'.

MailOnline contacted representatives of Candice for comment at the time.  

Dennis shares his pugs Dennis and Albus and his Pomeranian Sybil with Great British Bake Off star Candice. 

It comes after Candice's 'love rival' Micah claimed the couple, who married in France in September 2018, had actually parted ways at the start of the year.

She told The Sun: 'Liam and Candice broke up at the start of the year and I met him on a dating website in April. Liam and Candice had been over for a long time before we got together.

'But the way she announced the split made me look like a homewrecker because Liam and I were on holiday.

'I was mortified to see I’d been caught up in it when it was genuinely nothing to do with me.' 

Liam told MailOnline last month how his relationship with Candice collapsed under the pressures of fame as the TV cook's career took off after winning Bake Off in 2016.

Speaking out: It comes after Candice's 'love rival' Micah claimed the couple, who married in France in September 2018, had actually parted ways at the start of the year 

He said at the time that he had gone on a two-week break to get over the split while insisting that nobody else was involved in the break-up.

Micah posted two pictures on Facebook of her and Liam sunning themselves in Greece on July 19.   

The pair looked cosy during their relaxing break, but Liam denied she was his girlfriend when contacted by MailOnline, insisting: 'I am not in a relationship with anyone.' 

Candice's ex told how he had struggled with being thrust into his wife's showbiz world after she won the Channel 4 show and appeared on Dancing On Ice.

He confirmed he had moved out of the flat they shared with their three dogs Dennis, Albus and Sybil above the gastro pub she runs with her brother, The Green Man in Eversholt, Bedfordshire.

Speaking of their marriage split, he said: 'There is nobody else involved. We have just sadly decided it wasn't working.'

Candice first met Liam in the bar where he worked while studying for a degree, back in 2012.

After five years of dating, the couple announced their engagement in October 2017, just over a year after she first appeared on Bake Off.

Their relationship came under strain just days after becoming engaged when Candice was pictured kissing Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood, 54, on the cheek during a night out.  

Liam said last month: 'I'd not long asked Candice to marry me and I had to read reports that my new fiancée was seen kissing Hollywood and getting close to him.

'That was just a kiss on her cheek and there was nothing else to it. But we had only been engaged a few days. It was a lot to have to deal with.'

The couple went on to tie the knot in a romantic ceremony at Château de Varennes in Burgundy, France, in September 2018.

But Liam said they had called time on their marriage after a series of long talks.

He said: 'My wife is a lovely woman and a wonderful human being and I could never find anything detrimental to say about her.'
