Sir Bradley Wiggins has admitted that it 'seems almost pathetic' in retrospect just how much he wanted to win the Tour de France during his road racing career.

Wiggins, now retired, became the first British man to win the prestigious tour event, seen as the pinnacle of a rider's career, culminating down the Champs-Elysées in Paris, in 2012.  

The 40-year-old, in conversation with the Radio Times, looked back at his triumph eight years ago and opened up on the out-of-body experience he felt on the final few corners when he knew he would win and make history.

Wiggins admits it 'seems pathetic' when he looks back and realises how much it meant to him

The latest issue of the Radio Times magazine is out on September 5

'I was filled with flashbacks and memories, and I had no control over them,' he said. 

'I was cycling hard, negotiating bends, avoiding the public, controlling the bike - and at the same time I was remembering cycling in Regent's Park with my grandparents.

'I'd spent decades dreaming about doing it. I'd never imagined winning, but I'd dreamt it. Winning - that must be what I'd lived for. I could admit that to myself now that it was actually happening.

'You look back and you realise how important it all was. And it seems almost pathetic - pathetic that it meant so much to me at the time…'

Wiggins' career has been littered with incredible successes in road and track events with the Brit adding five Olympic gold medals and eight indoor world championship gold medals. 

But it is the victory in 2012 at the Tour de France which solidified his status among the pantheon of greats from the sport, given the notoriously difficult nature to win the event.

The first Tour de France took place in 1903 but this year's event was pushed back from June to late August to ensure at least some fans could be on hand to line the route. 

Since Wiggins' success for Team Sky in 2012, British riders have dominated the iconic Tour. 

Chris Froome, who was not selected by Team Ineos as part of their eight-man team for this year's race, has won it four times (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017).

Welsh rider Geraint Thomas took the yellow jersey and won it for Team Sky in 2018. 

He too has been overlooked for Ineos' squad for the 2020 event.
