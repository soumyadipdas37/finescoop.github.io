England have claimed the T20 series against Australia as Jos Buttler's 77 not out powered them to a six-wicket victory over their rivals on Sunday.

Buttler racked up the runs with some impressive boundaries at the Ageas Bowl, as Moeen Ali joined him late on with a crucial six.

The hosts survived a late scare as Eoin Morgan was caught for seven with less than 20 balls left for the Aussies.
