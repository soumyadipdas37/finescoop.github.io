Shaughna Phillips has revealed that she had lipsuction performed on her lower legs last week, in a bid to combat a medical condition she only recently learned of.

The Love Island star, 26, shared a snap of herself going into surgery last week, as well as her legs in bandages – but didn't disclose the nature of her treatment.

However, during a Q&A with fans on Instagram on Sunday, the TV personality shared the nature of her surgery, after being diagnosed with lipodema – a chronic condition where there's a build up of abnormal fat cells in the legs, thighs and buttocks.

Amid conducting the Q&A session to promote her InTheStyle range, Shaughna addressed the multitude of questions she'd received about her surgery.

She said: 'So just because I've seen so many questions on my InTheStyle Q&A about what surgery I've had, I just thought I'd let you all know because I'm not going to hide anything and I was going to tell you all anyway.

'I have had liposuction on my lower legs, so my calves, because I was recently diagnosed with lipoedema, once I'd come out of the [love Island] villa.

'I've kind of always had an insecurity about my legs, but there were so many questions about if I'd ever been diagnosed with lipoedema, and I didn't even know what it was.'

She continued: 'So after some research and going to the doctors, I was finally diagnosed and then had my surgery on Wednesday.

'I'm recovering, I'm doing really well. I've got make-up on today, I've brushed my hair today and, yeah, I'm just really looking forward to kind of the process of it.

'It's not an overnight thing, I have to keep up with my compression garments and things like that, but so far so good.'

In the snaps in question, Shaughna posed for a selfie in a hospital bed, as she admitted she was in 'hospital swag' and was 'so high' after the procedure.

A second picture showed her legs covered in bandages from her thigh to her ankles, with her feet poking out at the bottom.

Referring to her feet, Shaughna, who appeared on Love Island at the start of the year when the series filmed in South Africa, joked: 'Hello swollen tootsies.'

As she unveiled her latest range on Sunday afternoon, she wrote: 'Cannot believe this is now my 4th official @inthestyle range!! Your support has been amazing and I hope you love this one!

'None of this would be possible without your support, these are as much OUR collections as they are mine.'

Shaughna soared to fame earlier this year on the winter series of Love Island where she was left heartbroken after beau Callum Jones dumped her for Molly Smith in Casa Amor.

The feisty Londoner became an internet sensation after she calmly said: 'Congrats, hun' after discovering the news.

In June, Shaughna hit back at a troll who accused her of undergoing secret surgery during lockdown in the comments section of her Instagram page. 

The reality star, who was told she looked 'better before fillers' while on the show, questioned when she would have had injections during the coronavirus pandemic.

Shaughna had posted a stunning snap of herself on her social media feed, posing with a new Protein World product she was advertising.

 However underneath the image one critic penned: 'You looked better on love island ... u look twice your age now with all these fillers omgosh.'

Shaughna snapped back: '…please please PLEASEEEEEEE tell me when you think I've had the time to get fillers during a WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC

'If you want to insult me, then it's strange anyway, but at least make it realistic! D**n son, do better! [sic]'. 

Setting the record straight, Shaughna responded saying: 'no angel I'm not denying anything, and never have. I openly speak about fillers I've had all the time, and I love them.

'What I'm denying is having anything done since leaving Love Island because of a WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC.'
