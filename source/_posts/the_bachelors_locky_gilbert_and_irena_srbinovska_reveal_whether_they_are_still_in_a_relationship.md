Proving recent rumours that Locky had already split with winner wrong, Irena excitedly continued: 'I have found a job in Perth and can’t wait to start living the rest of my life with Locky.'

Irena has just completed her two-week quarantine period in New South Wales to reunite with the former Australian Survivor star so they can travel the stage together for the next few weeks. 

They are then planning to quarantine together for a fortnight in Perth before officially moving in together. 

Irena continued to gush to the publication about her relationship with Locky as she admitted she wanted to 'spend the rest of her life with him. 

As well as her romance with Locky her soured friendship with rival finalist Bella Varelis became a major storyline on the show. 

And Irena has confirmed that she hasn't spoken to the brunette since wrapping filming on the series but wishes her 'nothing but the best'.

While Locky admitted that it was 'hard' to watch his two finalists fall out on television, he also confessed that he hasn't spoken to her since dumping her in front of cameras.

Thursday night's emotion-filled finale of the popular dating series saw Locky choose Irena as his winner.

In a twist no one saw coming, the 30-year-old had told both Irena and Bella Varelis that he had fallen in love with them - leading both to believe they had won his heart.

But ultimately, it was down to earth nurse Irena who stole the burly adventure man's heart - leaving Bella completely devastated.

 After a distraught Bella stormed off the set, Locky came face-to-face with Irena to give her the good news - telling her he 'couldn't wait' to spend the rest of his life with her.

 'Irena,' he began. 'Every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that.

'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole, whole package.’

Locky had placed viewers on the edge of their seat, when he admitted he had his doubts.

'However, my biggest fear is taht you're not gonna be able to put yourself first, or tell me no. And in my partner I want drive and ambition,' he said.

But then he turned to Irena and said: 'And I think you've got that in spades. When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'

'I love you too,' she beamed in response.
