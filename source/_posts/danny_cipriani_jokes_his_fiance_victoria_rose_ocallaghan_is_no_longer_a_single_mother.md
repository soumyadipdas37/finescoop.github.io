They recently sparked rumours of a secret wedding just weeks after getting engaged.

And Danny Cipriani seemed to further fuel those claims on Saturday after he left a sweet response to fiancée Victoria Rose O'Callaghan's latest Instagram post on Saturday.

The rugby star, 32, claimed Victoria, 39, was 'no longer a single mother,' in a response to her latest post following their cinema date, after she hit back at trolls who questioned whether lone parents could be 'intelligent or educated.'

In the caption she insisted that despite her status as a single parent, she can still 'have a career' and is 'wildly intelligent.'

She wrote: 'This has got to be the goofiest photo I’ve ever taken, however it was a real goofy moment! 

'I did edit out a pimple that grew between my eyebrows, if I hadn’t - I would have had to introduce her and give her a first second and last name.

'Bizarrely enough single Mothers can be educated, have a career, be wildly intelligent and wear eyelashes so no hate!!!'

Danny was then quick to clarify that Victoria no longer needed to look after her children alone, as he penned the response: 'You are educated, fiercely intelligent, stunning, sexy. Captivating. Unapologetically brilliant. 

'Your love is life changing. PS you’re no longer a single mother.'

Married? Earlier this week Danny and Victoria sparked rumours that they may already have tied the knot following a whirlwind engagement

Earlier this week Danny and Victoria sparked rumours that they may already have tied the knot following a whirlwind engagement.

On Wednesday evening Danny took to Instagram to introduce his new 'wife' to his followers, as he referred to her as Victoria Cipriani.

Alongside a stunning selfie of his other half, Danny wrote: 'Introducing @victoriarosecipriani - pinch myself every day!'

Many of Danny's followers appeared to take the doting post as confirmation that the sports star and the brunette beauty are now man and wife.

It comes just a day after Victoria, who is a grandmother, shared a loving tribute to the media personality as she shared sweet snaps of them together.



Speculation: On Wednesday evening Danny took to Instagram to introduce his new 'wife' to his followers, as he referred to her as Victoria Cipriani

Victoria, who is good friends with Kerry Katona, explained that while she typically struggles with public displays of affection, he has helped her adjust. 

In her lengthy caption, Victoria penned: 'I can’t say I’ve ever been a great fan of public displays of affection however I’m all for breaking out of my comfort zones so here goes. It’s been very challenging to read what I’ve read about myself lately...

'Life always balances itself out perfectly though. I lay back every night feeling completely grateful for my perfect Family and amazing Friends...

'I wake up every morning appreciative that I am lucky enough to spend another day with all the people I love. I've spent a lifetime making sure everyone else is ok so it’s the greatest feeling to be showered with the love I get from you.

'I love you. I fully accept you. I am so proud of the man you are. What you have achieved and I am counting down the sleeps until I become your Wife.' 

To be wed: Danny will become a stepfather to Victoria's two children, Jade Austin, 24, and a teenage son, 14, when the pair marry in October

Danny will become a stepfather to her two children, Jade Austin, 24, and a teenage son, 14, when the pair marry in October. 

The sportsman will take on the role of step-grandfather after Victoria's daughter Jade became a mum four years ago.

Danny's fiancée gave birth to her first child when she was just 14, with the pair often mistaken for sisters now that Jade has a daughter of her own.

The pair went public with their relationship in June, with Danny saying the mental health campaigner makes him 'the happiest man in the world.'

Danny, who's previously had long-term relationships with Kelly Brook, 40, and Katie Price, 42, referred to Victoria's children on Instagram, saying: 'You make me want to be the best man I possibly can for you and our family.'

The rugby player found love again four months after expressing his heartache over the tragic death of ex-girlfriend Caroline Flack, who he described as 'so kind and so beautiful' in an emotional video on social media.

Danny's new fiancée was born Victoria Rose O'Callaghan and is from Derby, but has also used the surnames Hare and Newbold throughout her life.

Victoria has had two long-term relationships before falling for Danny, including with Steven Austin, who is the father of her daughter, and ex-boyfriend Gavin Dunnicliffe.   

Danny's future wife also had a brief fling with Alex Reid, 45, in 2012, shortly after his split from ex Katie Price.

Victoria welcomed her first child when she was 14 with former partner Steve, who tragically died aged 22 in September 1999, leaving the young mum to raise their baby on her own.

Zara Newbold, 31, who's Victoria's half-sister, told MailOnline of her sibling's difficult past, and said her and Danny are lucky to have found each other.
