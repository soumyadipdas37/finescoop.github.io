Alice Beer left This Morning's viewers in hysterics on Thursday after she strapped a jet pack to herself to 'take to the skies', but only made it a few centimetres above ground.

The presenter, 55, had spent all morning practicing to fly by expert Richard Browning, who showed how you could use the high-tech tool to fly over a lake.

However, the most Alice managed was to get her feet off the ground, with fans of the show joking it was the rope hoisting her up rather than the jet pack.

As Alice whizzed around in circles, Holly Willoughby, 39, said: 'She's going to be so dizzy. It's hard to know if it's the winch that's hoiking her up or the pressure.'

Phillip Schofield, 58, commented: 'Looks to me it could be something that could get really easily out of control. She's been there for quite a while practicing. 

As he tried to call to Alice, Holly said: 'I don't think she can here us'.

There she goes! The most Alice managed was to get her feet off the ground, with fans of the show joking it was the rope hoisting her up rather than the jet pack

Ahhh! As Alice whizzed around in circles, Holly Willoughby, 39, said: 'She's going to be so dizzy. It's hard to know if it's the winch that's hoiking her up or the pressure'

Phil replied: 'I don't think she should be splaying about like that though'.

As she crashed to the floor Holly squealed: 'Oh my gosh', while Phil told viewers: 'There you go. 

'We did that for no good reason whatsoever.'

Entertaining: Phil replied: 'I don't think she should be splaying about like that though'





Amusing: Fans of the show soon took to Twitter to comment on the chaos

Fans of the show soon took to Twitter to comment on the chaos. 

One wrote: 'That was hilarious watching #alice 'flying' on #ThisMorning with a jet pack.

Another added: 'Did anyone else think Alice was going to go FLYING in that jetpack? 

A third chimed: 'So basically the jetpack doesn't work and Alice Beer is being swung around by a hoist...' 

'Sooo... I guess we're not adding 'Flying a Jetpack' to the list of things Alice Beer is an expert in,' a fourth fan typed, while another viewer said: 'So basically it's Alice dangling on a rope'.
