Valorant is taking on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. First announced as "Project A" during Riot's 10-year anniversary stream, the 5v5 FPS blends the character abilities of Overwatch with five-on-five gunplay that rewards quick reflexes and precision, and Riot says it's put a huge amount of work into ensuring lag and wonky hit detection don't get in the way.

Those bold technical promises are the primary way Riot intends to differentiate Valorant from its direct competition, which includes Overwatch, CS:GO, and Rainbow Six Siege. Even if it does have the best netcode, though, that won't mean anything if Valorant's mix of quick time-to-kill combat and character abilities doesn't feel distinct enough.

To help get you up to speed, we've absorbed every bit of information (including experiences from our own hands-on demo) and whipped up this overview of all things Valorant, from its expected release date to the guns you'll using. As more details emerge, you can return to this page to stay up to date on all the latest intel. Here's everything we know so far about Valorant, Riot Games' new FPS.

How to get into the Valorant closed beta

The closed Valorant beta has started in the US, Canada, Europe, Russia, and Turkey. Unlike most betas that email accepted participants at random, you'll have to get a random beta key by watching qualified Twitch streamers. Here's how to sign up:

 Register for a Riot account (create a Riot account here) 
 Link your Riot account to a Twitch account (create a Twitch account here) 
 When closed beta activates in your region (EU and NA for now), watch specific Valorant streams highlighted on Twitch for the opportunity to be entitled for Closed Beta access 
When is Valorant's release date? 

Riot hasn't officially confirmed a release date for Valorant, but it's planning to release it in the summer of 2020. The exact release date will depend on feedback received during Valorant's beta.
