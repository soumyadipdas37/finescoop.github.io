TikTok star Charly Jordan is apologizing for traveling at the 'incorrect time' and for slamming officials after she tearfully revealed the Rwandan government held her in isolation for days following a 'false positive' COVID-19 test during a trip there. 

Jordan, 21, who is member of TikTok collab group Clubhouse, said she traveled with a group to Rwanda to work with gorillas with an animal conservation group, according to the TikTok posted Sunday.

In the emotional video she said she contracted the virus three months ago but tested negative before leaving the US. She said she and her friends wore masks, took precautions, and followed safety measures after arriving in Rwanda.

But when she arrived and was tested, she got a positive result.

'I got 100,000 tests afterwards to make sure I was negative. I flew to Rwanda, Africa, five days ago, and just got here, and tested positive,' she explained.  

TikTok star Charly Jordan, 21, issued a public apology on Monday for sharing an 'emotional' and 'reactive' TikTok on Sunday (above) where she cried and said she was being held in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19 in Rwanda. She was released after four days and that result was deemed a false positive

Apology: Jordan shared this post on her Instagram and Twitter on Monday saying she 'learned her lesson' and shouldn't have traveled in the midst of a pandemic 

She added that she was alone and scared when she filmed the TikTok and now realizes 'how inappropriate and reactive' the video was

She has since set that video to private, but it has been reshared on Twitter where she was slammed for traveling amid a pandemic and crying about her situation.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people from the US avoid nonessential travel to most countries including Rwanda due to the pandemic. 

Jordan said she cried for hours and was hyperventilating after being placed in isolation in a hotel. 

'Literally the f***ing government showed up at my place and dragged me away from everybody I was with. I don't speak the language, they locked me in this f***ing room, and I can't leave,' she said in the TikTok.

'It’s really scary. I don’t know why I have it again. And I’m not with anybody I know. And I’m in f***ing Rwanda, Africa. And I don’’t know how long I’m gonna be here and they won’t tell me anything,' she added with a peace sign. 

Last week Jordan shared this Instagram post in Rwanda telling her 3.2million Instagram followers about her trip

She shared a follow-up TikTok video saying she smoked marijuana every day for the past three and a half years and was going 'cold turkey' in the hotel room they were isolating her in.

'Not only am I completely alone, locked in this room, but I'm having withdrawals and crazy nightmares and not sleeping,' she said.

'And all the food here is making me sick. So we are just all around not in a good place right now. I've literally just cried for three hours,' she added.

Jordan was released four days later when two more tests came back negative and the first one was determined to be a false positive. 

On Monday she shared an apology on Instagram writing: 'The video I uploaded to TikTok was very emotional. I never meant to offend anyone and I take full responsibility for my actions.'

Twitter users slammed Jordan for traveling during the pandemic, blasting her as a white savior for claiming her trip was in the name of charity work







'I was alone and scared, watching it back I realize how inappropriate and reactive the video was. I never meant to offend anyone I was just trying to figure out what was going on…I truly am sorry.

'I took down the video because after watching it back I realized how inappropriate it was,' she added.

She also apologized for traveling at such a precarious time as the US reels from more than six million cases of COVID-19 and more than 188,000 deaths.

'I would like to make an apology for traveling during this time, because I know that it’s a very incorrect time to travel, and I’m completely wrong for doing that, and I have learned my lesson one hundred percent,' she said.
