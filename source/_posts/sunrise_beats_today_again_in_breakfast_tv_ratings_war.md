Seven's Sunrise continues to be the nation's most-watched breakfast television program across the five capital cities.

According to the latest OzTAM figures released on Saturday, the show co-hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, achieved a weekly average of 273,000.

Despite showing an improvement in the ratings in the previous survey, Channel Nine's Today trawled behind with a weekly average of 212,000.

Rubbing salt into the wound was the fact that Sunrise recorded the highest numbers in each capital city, including Brisbane, where Today previously held a victory. 

The first week of September saw Today finally catching up to rival Sunrise.

Fronted by Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon, the struggling breakfast program won on the east coast.

Today beat Sunrise by 195,000 to 181,000 in total people, across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. 

However, Sunrise was still the most-watched breakfast TV program across the five capital cities, with a viewership of 259,000 compared to Today's 229,000.     

A week earlier, Today had claimed victory in the east coast capitals of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, pulling a combined average audience of 191,000 - which was more than Sunrise's 189,000.

These figures represented a triumphant leap in the ratings for Today, which had previously dragged around 70,000 viewers behind Sunrise back in June. 

Speaking to investors earlier this month, Channel Nine's CEO, Hugh Marks, commented on Today's progress over the past nine months.

'If you look at morning segments, Today show numbers are up around 10 or 15 per cent year on year and continuing to grow. Karl and Ally are doing a good job there for us,' Marks said.

Karl is understood to have recently signed a new contract with Nine, and Allison and the rest of the team are also locked in multi-year deals. 

With a renewed focus on the job, Karl admitted last year that his performance wasn't great in 2018, when ratings were falling at a rapid pace and his personal life was dominating headlines.  

He said at the time: 'Towards the end of last year, I was cooked. It had taken its toll, a lot of the [media] attention - all the unwarranted attention I thought, and you can't control any of that.

'I'm not going to complain too much about that, but what it meant was that in a work capacity I don't believe for a second I was at my best. I think I was struggling towards the end of last year.'
