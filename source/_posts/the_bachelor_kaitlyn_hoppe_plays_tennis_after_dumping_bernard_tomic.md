She was kicked off The Bachelor on Thursday's episode - which was filmed in July - and confirmed after her exit that she had also split from troubled tennis star Bernard Tomic after dating on and off for years.

But Kaitlyn Hoppe didn't look remotely heartbroken as she enjoyed a game of tennis with a female friend on the Gold Coast - just hours before viewers across Australia watched her getting dumped by Locky Gilbert.

The 26-year-old blonde couldn't wipe the smile off her face during the match, and her skimpy outfit turned plenty of heads as she dashed around the court.

The reality star flaunted her voluptuous figure in a tight sports bar and short black tennis skirt, which she paired with white sneakers.

She accessorised with a visor, and styled her flaxen locks in a sporty ponytail.

Despite working up a sweat during the friendly game, Kaitlyn was wearing a full face of glamorous makeup.

On Friday, Kaitlyn confirmed she was no longer in contact with Bernard Tomic, 27, with whom she'd reconnected about two months ago, following an argument at a Gold Coast strip club earlier this month.

She told The Daily Telegraph that their 'friendship is definitely over', after dating the former world No. 17 on and off for a number of years.

'I do wish him the best and I hope he finds his way and surrounds himself with people who have his best interests at heart,' she added.

Kaitlyn downplayed their romantic connection, but said she had stayed 'loyal' to the fallen sportsman for years.

'It's more like loyalty with him and I've always had a soft spot for him because I know a lot of people don't like him, but I wouldn't call it dating or a relationship,' she said.

It comes after Bernard and Kaitlyn had a very public row at the Hollywood Showgirls strip joint on Saturday, September 5.

Their argument led to Kaitlyn leaving the club, while Bernard - a regular patron - was allowed to stay.

A source told Daily Mail Australia the altercation brought the club to a standstill.

'They got in a big fight at Hollywood Showgirls the other weekend... everyone heard and saw it,' the onlooker said.

'It was crazy, even for a night out on the Gold Coast. They were screaming at each other.'

Having long been regarded as the brightest future star in world tennis, Bernard's career is almost at a point of no return.

The world No. 209 has not won a Grand Slam singles match since mid-2018.

The former Wimbledon quarter finalist was such a prodigious young talent that at 12 he was signed by management giant IMG.

But after reaching a highest ranking of 17 in 2016, his career has been downhill ever since and marred by a number of incidents both off and on the court.

Kaitlyn is the daughter of former NRL star Sean Hoppe, who was the league's leading try scorer in 1995.

A former real estate agent and model, she entered The Bachelor as an intruder in episode two, but was eliminated on Thursday night in scenes that were filmed in July.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
