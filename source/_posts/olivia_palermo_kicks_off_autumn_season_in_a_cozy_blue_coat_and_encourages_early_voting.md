The City alum Olivia Palermo kicked off the autumn season by wearing a bright blue coat while running errands solo in Manhattan on Monday.

The Connecticut-born, Brooklyn-based 34-year-old protected herself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a pinkish lavender face mask, which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made mandatory for all public outings on April 15.

As of Monday, there have reportedly been 245K confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City leading to 23,782 deaths.

Olivia toted a straw basket bag and finished off her fall attire with a cobalt-blue top, grey distressed skinny jeans, and black lace-up boots.

Missing from Palermo's side on Monday was her handsome husband Johannes Huebl, with whom she celebrated six years of marriage on June 21.

The Edit blogger originally met the German 42-year-old model through friends when she was attending The New School back in 2008.

Olivia and her beloved dog, Mr. Butler, appeared in an Instastory where she encouraged Americans to vote early in the presidential election.

'Did you know that in more than 40 states you can vote early in-person?! To be honest, I didn't,' Palermo - who boasts 8.1M social media followers - wrote on Monday.

'If you’re concerned about social distancing on Election Day or mail-in ballot timing, early in-person voting may be a great option for you! 

'Follow @theearlyvote for more resources and information to make your voice heard. And for my beloved international OP community, spread the word to your American friends!'

After years of collaborating with other brands, the fashion maven finally made the leap in February to design her very own 53-piece clothing collection ranging in price from $275-$1,595.

'It's something I have always thought to do,' Olivia told InStyle at the time.

'It was just a matter of when timing was right. I think after 10 years, working on enough collaborations, my brand is changing and going into the next phase.'
