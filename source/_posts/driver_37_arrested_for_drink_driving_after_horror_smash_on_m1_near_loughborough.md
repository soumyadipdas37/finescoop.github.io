An driver has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving as a passenger in another car fights for their life in hospital.

Police have closed the M1 in Leicestershire, near junction 23 for Loughborough, following the crash just before 11.20pm last night.

Three people travelling in a black Range Rover have suffered injuries following the crash on the northbound carriageway with an Audi RS4.

Three people were injured in a crash on the M1 near Junction 23 for Loughborough last night. The southbound carriageway (right) has been reopened, but the northbound is expected to remain shut for most of this morning

A passenger in the rear of the Range Rover was seriously injured and remains in a critical condition.Â 

The Audi's driver was not injured, with a 37-year-old man in custody after being arrested on suspicion of drink driving and driving offences.

The force said diversions are in place and the motorway is 'likely to remain closed for some time'.

Highways England tweeted earlier: 'The southbound has been now reopened. The northbound carriageway will remain closed into the morning. Diversions remain in place for the northbound traffic.'

Police asked for anyone with information, or who may have captured part of the crash on a dash camera, to phone 101 and quote incident 743 of 26 September.
