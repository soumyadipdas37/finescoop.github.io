Lady Bianca Eliot’s personal life has been blighted by sadness, but I am delighted to report that she is expecting her fourth child.

Bianca’s first husband was Lord Eliot, heir to the sprawling Port Eliot estate in Cornwall. Tragically, he died aged just 40 in 2006 following an epileptic fit. Lady B was left a widow at 29 with three children.

Four years later she was engaged to Earl Spencer – Princess Diana’s brother Charles – but he dumped her weeks before their wedding.

She now lives with 36-year-old Mark Tamburrino, at Port Eliot, and their baby is due around Christmas. A friend tells me: ‘They are always friendly and kind – the locals can’t wait until they open The Eliot Arms, the pub they recently bought here.’

If Lady B marries Mark, she will lose her title but if she’s running the pub at least she’ll gain another one – landlady!

Poor Liam Gallagher can’t work out how his fire works. 

Former Oasis bandmate Paul Arthurs tells me: ‘We both have log burners. I sent him a video of mine and Liam texted, “Mine’s rubbish, it don’t work. I put paper in and I threw logs on and it just went out.” ’ 

Liam, are you sure she’s not electric?
