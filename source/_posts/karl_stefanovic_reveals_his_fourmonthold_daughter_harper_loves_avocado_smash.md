Karl Stefanovic and his wife Jasmine Yarbrough welcomed their daughter, Harper earlier this year. 

And on Wednesday, the Today host revealed that his four-month-old tot has started eating solid food.  

In a weekly newsletter for the breakfast TV show, the 46-year-old explained that like any true Sydneysider, she’s a fan of smashed avocado. 

'Our little girl is growing up!' On Wednesday, Karl Stefanovic (pictured) revealed his four-month-old daughter Harper was eating solids and loves avocado smash 

'Little Harper May has expressed great interest in solid foods,' he wrote. 

'The little one has been eyeing off the avocado smash for some time now and yesterday we finally relented. Awww… our little girl is growing up.' 

In the newsletter, the TV personality also revealed Harper isn't 'sleeping the best at night' and pleaded with his fans for advice to help get the little one rested.

Last week the doting dad showed off his fun sense of humour, when he shared a snap of Harper on Instagram. 

The tiny tot was seen wearing an adorable orange onesie with 'Baby Karlos' written across the front. 

The photograph was taken in Karl's living room with Harper being held up by her shoe designer mother.

True to form, Harper was smiling away as the picture was taken. 

Karl and Jasmine welcomed their daughter Harper on May 1 at the North Shore Private Hospital in Sydney. 

It's the first child for the pair, while Karl has three children from his previous marriage to Cassandra Thorburn: sons Jackson, 20, and River, 12, and daughter Ava, 15.
