Harry Styles was surprised by a street performer who approached the singer and did a trick for him in a wholesome video.

The singer, 26, was strolling down a street in Los Angeles when he was stopped by Kid The Wiz, a performer who filmed the encounter for his Instagram.

'We're here with Harry Styles!' he said as he wrapped his arm around the surprised One Direction star.

Harry then gave a thumbs up and a smile to the camera as Kid The Whiz said: 'Check it out bro'.

He then took his hat off and flipped it upside down in the air before catching it perfectly back on his head.

Looking impressed, Harry smiled and said: 'Oh s**t!' 

Later, he shared a photo alongside Harry to his Instagram, writing: 'Legendary Moment That Is Now @HarryStyles & His Thumb Is Still Up.'

It comes after Harry filmed his new music video on Italy's picturesque Amalfi Coast earlier this week. 

The star got behind the wheel of a vintage Alfa Romeo to shoot scenes for the video to accompany another song release from his solo album Fine Line.

In a video filmed by @microba96 and shared on Twitter on Wednesday, the heartthrob was seen speeding around the coast roads in the stunning location.

Another car rigged with cameras was in front, capturing Harry as he confidently drove around.

Other scenes shot this week include Harry driving a speedboat off the coast, looking dapper in a striped white shirt.

Harry's return to work comes after he made the decision this month to postpone another leg of his 2020 Love On Tour shows.

The singer took to Twitter last week to announce that all of his shows would be delayed 'until further notice' amid the COVID-19 pandemic which has swept the globe.

Harry also shared his 'hope' to play his scheduled 2021 dates, as he insisted that 'everyone's health and safety remains top priority'.

Harry tweeted: 'Everyone's health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone all 2020 shows in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand until further notice.

'I really hope to play the shows as planned for 2021 but will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks and months. I can't wait to see you all on the road as soon as it's safe to do so.'
