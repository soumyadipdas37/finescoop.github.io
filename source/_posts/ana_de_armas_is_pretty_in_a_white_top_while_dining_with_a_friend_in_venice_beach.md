Ana de Armas was seen dining with a friend at the vegetarian restaurant The Butcher's Daughter in Venice Beach in California on Thursday.

The 32-year-old Cuban-born beauty wore a pretty white short-sleeved blouse with black slacks and matching sandals along with her half-heart necklace for her afternoon meal.

It has been over a month since the No Time To Die actress has been seen with her 48-year-old boyfriend Ben Affleck whom she worked with on the movie Deep Water.

They were last seen together in Venice Beach on August 20 as they were affectionate with each other.

Affleck has reportedly been in Ireland where he is filming The Last Duel for director Ridley Scott with best friend Matt Damon as his costar. Also in the movie is Star Wars actor Adam Driver.

Ben, Matt and Nicole Holofcener wrote the screenplay which is based on the book The Last Duel by Eric Jager. 

The film is set in Medieval France and the story is about betrayal. Filming began earlier this year but then halted due to COVID-19. Now with the proper restrictions, the cast is in front of the camera again.

Not together: It has been over a month since the No Time To Die actress has been seen with her boyfriend Ben Affleck whom she worked with on the movie Deep Water. He is reportedly in Ireland shooting The Last Duel; seen in April in LA 

This comes after Ana told Grazia magazine that she loves walking her dogs to relax.

The actress admits that going out with pup pals Elvis and Salsa is among her 'every day luxuries', because, despite her fame, she enjoys the simple things in life.

 'My every day luxuries are a cup of coffee in the morning with condensed milk, a walk with my pups Elvis and Salsa, or a relaxing yoga session,' she shared.

The Knives Out actress also revealed that her sense of style has become more 'relaxed' due to the lack of red carpet events and usual work commitments she has which have had to be halted due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

She explained: 'My style is definitely more relaxed - I've been wearing my sweatpants.'

Ana believes that focusing less on her sense of style has given her the opportunity to consider more important things.

She said: 'I've been less focused on my style and have been paying more attention to all of those things happening in the world.'

007 time: Ana plays CIA agent Paloma in the James Bond movie No Time To Die and apart from the kudos of joining the long list of Bond girls she wanted the role because the character is on a level playing field with 007 (Daniel Craig). She said: 'I was attracted to Paloma for so many reasons. She's such a dynamic character'

Ana plays CIA agent Paloma in the highly-anticipated James Bond movie No Time To Die and apart from the kudos of joining the long list of Bond girls she wanted the role because the character is on a level playing field with 007 (Daniel Craig).

She said: 'I was attracted to Paloma for so many reasons. She's such a dynamic character. She has a mission of her own and intersects with Bond so they can help each other. She's funny, strong and complex. I was really excited to play a woman in a Bond film that didn't need saving.'

The Cuban actress opened up about working with director Cary Joji Fukunaga to find the perfect look for her character. She said: 'We tried a bunch of different things, and then found the stunning navy dress and we knew that was the one. It was the perfect look. And it worked with the stunts!'
