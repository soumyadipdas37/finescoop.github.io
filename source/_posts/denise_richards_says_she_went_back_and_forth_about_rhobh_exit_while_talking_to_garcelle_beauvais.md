She starred on two seasons of Bravo's The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills before calling it quits.

Now Denise Richards is opening up about her reasons for departing the reality show with her costar Garcelle Beauvais, 53.

The 49-year-old former Bond girl said 'It was actually a really tough decision' in a new interview on Garcelle's talk show The Real, according to People.

More details: Denise Richards, 49, opened up about leaving The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills in an upcoming episode of The Real with her costar Garcelle Beauvais, according to People; shown in 2018

The upcoming episode is set to air Monday and will mark the season seven premiere of The Real and Beauvais' debut as a co-host, following the departures of Tamera Mowry-Housley and Amanda Seales over the summer.

'I've been a fan of the show and had a lot of fun doing my first season. Obviously my second season was very challenging,' Denise admitted on the show, which is also hosted by Adrienne Bailon, Loni Love and Jeannie Mai.

'You know, I went back and forth with it and at the end of the day, I decided it was time for me to move on and focus on other projects that I have. I'm glad that I did it though,' the actress continued.

Denise reserved special praise for her friend Garcelle, who provided a steadying presence on RHOBH.

'Garcelle, it almost makes me want to cry,' Denise said. 'I truly could not have gotten through the season without you, honestly. 

'She is a girl's girl, a good friend. Your loyalty is beyond and I really could not have gotten through this season without you.'

Denise was beset by claims on RHOBH that she and Brandi Glanville had carried on a secret affair.

Brandi, who is currently a guest on the series, claimed that the two women had a sexual encounter the first time they met in a restaurant bathroom.

She also said they later had sex on a trip to Mendocino, California, after Denise invited her to stay for the weekend while she filmed a movie there. 

Denise has been married since 2018 to Aaron Phypers, whom she began dating in late 2017.

Glanville claimed on RHOBH that her costar claimed she had an open relationship with her husband, before later reversing course and forbidding her to ever let him know of the alleged affair.

Denise's ex-husband Charlie Sheen, 55, recently told Page Six that he wasn't a part of his former wife's decision to leave the series.

'She does what she wants in these matters,' he said through his publicist Jeffrey Ballard, adding, 'And I applaud her decision of 'one and done.

Denise previously admitted to consulting with Charlie during an appearance on Andy Cohen's show Radio Andy. 

'I did talk to him about it because as an actor in this business, I respect his opinion too. So I said, "What do you think?" and he said, "I think it could be really cool,"' she recalled.

'Even if he said this is the dumbest thing you ever did, I still would have done the show. But it was interesting to get his side of it because I have a lot of respect for him as the father and being in this business for as many years as he has.' 

Bravo patriarchy Andy Cohen recently shared that the Wild Things star's departure was a matter of a stalled negotiation.

'I'm just sad we couldn't reach an agreement for next season,' the reality TV mastermind told PeopleTV's Reality Check on Monday. 'I'm kind of living in that sadness. 

'We were negotiating a deal with her and we couldn't reach an agreement on the deal,' he explained.
