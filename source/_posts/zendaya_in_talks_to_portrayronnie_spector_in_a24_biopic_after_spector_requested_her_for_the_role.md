Zendaya is thriving, after making history with her first Emmy win, while preparing for her next big blockbuster premiere.

And the former Disney Channel star is making moves, as she's eyed for another iconic leading lady role.

She's in talks to star as '60s music icon Ronnie Spector in an A24 biopic about the Walking In the Rain artist, and she was reportedly requested by Ronnie herself for the role.

The 24-year-old will also be involved as a producer, alongside Ronnie, 77, and husband Jonathan Greenfield as executive producers, according to Deadline.

Marc Platt (who is producing the live-action adaptations of The Little Mermaid, Dear Evan Hansen and Wicked) will also produce, and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury is in early conversations to pen the script.

It comes after A24 closed deals for her life rights and the rights to her 1990 biography Be My Baby, which she wrote with Vince Waldron.

Born Veronica Yvette Bennett, Ronnie grew up in Spanish Harlem, before forming the girl group The Ronettes with her older sister Estelle Bennett and cousin Nedra Talley.

Tumultuous divorce: The ladies were signed by infamously unstable record producer Phil Spector, 80, whom Ronnie married in 1968, before their tumultuous divorce in 1974 (pictured in 1963)

The ladies were signed by infamously unstable record producer Phil Spector, 80, whom Ronnie married in 1968.

According to her book, Phil subjected her to years of psychological abuse, keeping her as a prisoner in her own home, with barbwire fences, guard dogs and confiscating her shoes to keep her from running away.

Ronnie fought him for the rights to her music in their subsequent divorce, which was finalized in 1974, before she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007 with her fellow Ronettes.

Much like Elton John and Aretha Franklin have done with their recent biopics, Ronnie made the choice to cast Zendaya as herself in her younger years.  

It comes after the Euphoria actress landed her first Emmy Award for her leading role as Rue Bennett in the A24 teen series on HBO.
