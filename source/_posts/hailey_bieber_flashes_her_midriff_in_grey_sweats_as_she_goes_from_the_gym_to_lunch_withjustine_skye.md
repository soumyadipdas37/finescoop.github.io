She's been seen all over the Los Angeles area of late, ever since returning from her most recent travels with beloved husband Justin Bieber.

And Hailey Bieber cut an athletic figure Friday, when she was spotted in West Hollywood making her way from the gym to lunch with best friend Justine Skye.

The model, 23, wore a high-necked cropped grey sweatshirt with a zip turtleneck collar, allowing her bare toned midriff to breathe.

The blond beauty paired this with matching drawstring sweatpants.

Hailey also rocked a black LA Raiders baseball cap pulled down low over her eyes, along with a black face mask as protection against COVID-19. 

Her enormous diamond engagement ring stole the attention on her hand as she ambled along with her pal Justine, 25.

Bieber completed her look with patterned sneakers laced up in pink.

Skye, meanwhile, also wore sweats, in the form of a white sweatshirt with small black text on the front and one sleeve.

She matched this with a pair of black leggings with white accents at the hips.

The singer carried a black purse with silver chain handle.

Her athletic footwear was in white, in keeping with her monochromatic look.

Justine's braids were fastened back in a low ponytail, and she covered up with sunglasses and a black face mask similar to Hailey's.

The pair of friends headed in for a bite at Zinque Cafe on Melrose Avenue.

It was at least their second lunch date in the area this week – on Wednesday, they met up with pal Kendall Jenner for lunch nearby. 

This week, Justine's Instagram Story was populated with tributes to Kendall's close male pal Fai Khadra, who turned 29 years old on Wednesday.

And Hailey, in turn, celebrated Justine's 25th birthday, which fell at the end of last month, on her own Instagram Story.
