An outback hotel, 600km from Darwin, which was immortalised in song by Slim Dusty has been put up for sale with a $3million price tag. 

The Top Springs Hotel is currently owned by cattle baron Milton Jones, who owns Coolibah Station and was the star of 2010 reality show Keeping Up With The Joneses.

The hotel, which Slim Dusty called the place to be for 'beer and song' in his track Top Springs, is 291km south of Katherine and is a popular spot on the Savanah Way.

'Selling a property such as this is about finding people that want that lifestyle,' Ms Thompson told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's not just pub you just go to down the road, it's people who know the community.

'Its always packed out, and I have been told it can be hard to get a room.'

She said it's a home away from home for many who work in the area.
