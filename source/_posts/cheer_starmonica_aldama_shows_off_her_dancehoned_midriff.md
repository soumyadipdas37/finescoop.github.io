She's the tough coach on the hit Netflix series Cheer.

But Monica Aldama is getting a taste of her own medicine as a contestant on Dancing With The Stars.

Monica updated fans on her grueling rehearsals on Wednesday, where she posted a snap of her dance-honed abs and joked having a demanding DWTS partner was 'karma' for what she put her cheerleaders through.

In the photo, Monica proudly pointed towards her sculpted midsection whilst clad in a black sports bra and matching leggings.

Though she may have been wiped out after a week of practice, Monica didn't let it show as she flashed a beaming smile for the camera.

'Thank you DWTS!' she began in the caption. 'The abs are starting to make a come back. I've officially been in LA for 2 weeks and 3 days but it feels like much longer.

'I've been practicing for a week and a half, and to be honest, I've never worked this hard physically in my life. I've learned so much in such little time - although I'm still working on that technique.

Making moves! Monica will begin competing for the Mirrorball Trophy on September 14

Who is it!? Monica teased the identity of her partner on Instagram over the weekend

'My partner has been amazing and is tough as nails on me. (Karma right???) I'm thankful for the opportunity to have this journey and I'm soaking in every bit of it.'

In the comments section, two of Monica's DWTS competitors showed their support for the beloved cheer coach.

Chrishell Stause commented a string of fire emojis, while Kaitlyn Bristowe remarked, 'Get it girrrllll.'

Even Cheer stars Jerry Harris and Morgan Simianer rooted Monica on.

Monica has not yet revealed who she has been partnered up with, though she did share a snap of herself dancing with him, using a giant emoji to conceal his identity.

'Learning so many new things with this amazing partner! Who are y'all hoping to see me dance with?' she asked in a photo posted over the weekend.

Go team! Nicknamed 'queen' by her cheerleaders, Monica expects not only the best from her team but also from herself

Nicknamed 'queen' by her cheerleaders, Monica expects not only the best from her team but also from herself.

'I'm very competitive and I want to be successful but I also want to be that person that leads by example. I really set a high standard for myself,' she previously told CNN Sport.

'If I expect something from my kids, I should expect it from myself too. I shouldn't even have to say anything but my actions will lead the kids and they'll do the things I'm doing.'

Season 29 of Dancing With The Stars will return to ABC on September 14.
