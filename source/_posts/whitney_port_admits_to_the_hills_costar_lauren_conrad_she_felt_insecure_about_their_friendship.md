They both starred on the popular reality series The Hills, which aired on MTV from 2006 until its finale in 2010.

And Whitney Port recently admitted to former co-star Lauren Conrad that she felt some 'insecurity' regarding the state of their friendship after leaving the drama-filled show in 2008.

On her Dear Media podcast With Whit, Port, 35, explained that her insecurity stemmed from Conrad becoming 'best friends' with 'a friend that [she] had a falling-out with.' 

And that she has 'for all this time' thought that 'because of that falling-out with this friend that it tinted how [Conrad] felt about [her].'

'I have felt this insecurity that maybe you thought certain things about me that may not have been true, or that I didn't have the chance to explain. I've always thought that maybe you were upset with me for what happened with that friend,' she concluded.

Though Whitney never mentioned the estranged 'friend' by name, Lauren, 34, hastily shutdown her longstanding concerns and insisted that any perceived distance was not personal.

'I wish we'd had this conversation, because when you said this, I was like, I actually have no idea what you're talking about,' she began.

'I have so much love for you and it's one of those things where I stopped filming and then I just kind of needed a clean break for a minute.' 

Conrad shocked fans when she left The Hills after having been the breakout star of the series for five seasons. She was replaced by her former Laguna Beach co-star Kristin Cavallari, 33, for the show's sixth and final season.

She added that she needed time to 'emotionally recover,' so she stepped out of the public eye and 'obviously moved out of L.A.'

Port, relieved to know there were no hard feelings between them, revealed to Conrad that she spoke to her husband Tim Rosenman about her concerns and that he encouraged her to clear the air. 

'I was talking to Timmy and he was like, "You always just have to clear things up or tell people how you feel and get the response."' 

Briefly circling back, Whitney stated that not knowing where they stood as friends for so long was 'so hard for [her].'

'Then because you guys became such close friends, I was like, 'Oh my God. Now Lauren is just going to think I'm the worst person.'''

Luckily for Whitney, that was not the case and she appeared beyond thrilled to be on the same page as Lauren.  

'I'm so happy that I told you and got it off my chest and that it's something that's so not a thing. It's something that I need to continue to tell myself, like, "Stop always believing these things you tell yourself. You have to get validation from the other person." It's not healthy for me to hold on to that.' 

Conrad said that, looking back on the evident strain on their friendship, she wishes she would have overcame her fear of 'confrontation' and spoken up, but, instead, she hoped that the issues would work themselves out in time.

To which Port replied: 'I think I also felt like once the show was over, you — not that you wanted nothing to do with it, 'cause I know it wasn't that — tried to remove yourself obviously a little bit because it was so personal for so many years and you were just, you know, you couldn't have that magnifying glass on your life anymore.' 

'I think that I fell into that bucket of, maybe she doesn't really want anything to do with me anymore because I'm a part of the show that she wants to move away from.'

Lauren said: 'I get it. I think, yeah. It was such an odd time for me, and I did it for as long as I could. It was one of those things where I was like, this isn't a healthy space for me anymore. I need to live my own life, and I really removed myself from that whole scene.'

She insisted that it 'had nothing to do with [Port] personally' and that it was just her wanting to branch out and figure out her life. 

Removing herself: It was such an odd time for me, and I did it for as long as I could. It was one of those things where I was like, this isn't a healthy space for me anymore. I need to live my own life, and I really removed myself from that whole scene,' explained Lauren of her post-The Hills life; Lauren pictured in February

'It's just really being like I need to live my life. I lived a certain way for so long. ... I am appreciative and I love you. And I love so many people we worked with.' 

'We started so young. It's such a time where you're figuring out who you are, and I did it in such a weird way,' said Lauren.

Port, in agreement, noted how hard it was to go from having 'a whole team of people making things happen for [them]' to, basically, fending for themselves.

'It's like, "Who am I?" 'How am I going to make things happen now?' Because for so long, there was a whole team of people making things happen for us. And then all of a sudden, it's like, no, we actually now need to be the creators of our own destiny,' she concluded.
