Former X Factor star Janet Devlin has revealed that 'joking' about her mental health struggles online has helped her through 'really dark times'.

The Northern Irish singer, 25, has spoken candidly about how she has self-harmed, had an alcohol addition and attempted suicide in the past and often references her journey in TikTok and YouTube videos.

And now the star, who appeared on the hit talent contest in 2011, has discussed how her unusual approach of 'laughing' has made her feel 'less alone', reports The Sun.

Candid: Janet Devlin has revealed that 'joking' about her mental health struggles on sites such as TikTok has helped her through 'really dark times'

Janet revealed that she realised she could approach her struggles in a different way after seeing people talking light-heartedly about their problems in an AA meeting. 

She said: 'Up until that point you'd taken everything so seriously. There's this big demon on your back and the amount of times you're obviously close to death, it's awfully scary. 

'The freedom to just laugh in the face of your demons, it takes their power away, in my opinion.'

Janet added that being 'welcomed to joke' was a huge weight off her shoulders, and that without realising she could do this, she may not have been able to get sober.   

Getting help: The former X Factor star said being 'welcomed to joke' was a huge weight off her shoulders and helped her get help for her alcohol addiction 

However the singer, whose most recent album is called Confessional, did add that she understands not everybody will understand her strategy.

Speaking on a YouTube video she explained: 'I know that for people that aren't used to hearing about these topics, it can feel a bit disjointed that I laugh about incredibly heavy things. But for me that's really what got me through the really dark times.'    

Janet explained that her own mental health issues were 'seriously deep-rooted' from when she was a young child and throughout her time on the X Factor.

She said that she'd be going about her day and all of a sudden find herself thinking about what to put in a suicide letter. 

Inner demons: Janet has previously revealed that it was feelings of self-loathing that led her to drink as she said: 'I hated myself so much, I despised who I was'

The singer has previously revealed during her time on the X Factor she was taken to see a therapist and psychologist in London's Harley Street for an assessment. 

There, it became apparent just how much Janet's mental health was suffering, with Janet stating: 'On a scale of one to 100, 100 being the worst, I scored 93. This was not good news. Proof, were it needed, of just how on the edge of suicide I was.'

The Running With Scissors hitmaker went on to say she put on a brave face for 'months' when in actual fact, she felt 'broken' inside. 

She said: 'No one around me even cared enough to ask if I was all right. So long as I was ready for the performance, that’s all that mattered.' 

MailOnline contacted X Factor for a comment at the time. 

Her way: The singer acknowledges that not everybody will understand her way of dealing with her mental health and that it 'can feel a bit disjointed that I laugh about incredibly heavy things'

Now Janet has said that she wants to 'normalise' having mental health issues by talking candidly about her own journey on social media. 

She said: 'The thing that saved me from myself was the fact people were laughing about the thing that I was taking so seriously.'

During lockdown Janet has spent most of her time living with pals in London and admitted that it has been difficult as she's been spending more time in her room, which is where she used to drink during her addiction. 

However she has been having regular online therapy and going to AA meetings to make sure she keeps talking about how she's feeling. 

Janet discussed her battle with alcoholism, revealing her life would have 'ended in the darkness and the pain' had she not got sober, back in March.

Speaking to her fans on her YouTube channel, the singer admitted that 'loneliness' during her teen years made her 'go off the rails.'

Of her struggle, Janet explained it was feelings of self-loathing that led her to drink as she said: 'I hated myself so much, I despised who I was. 

However, she credits going to AA with helping her overcome her struggle as they helped her 'become a person again', and she has been in recovery for five years.

Janet said: 'There are so many great things that have happened since I got sober, I never would have seen that, I never would have been able to live my life [without being] sober.

'My life would have ended in the darkness and the pain, and the hurt of being an alcoholic, when there's so much more to life than that.'
