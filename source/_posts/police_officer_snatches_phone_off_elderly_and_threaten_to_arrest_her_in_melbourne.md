Five police officers surrounded two elderly women sitting on a park bench in Melbourne and threatened to arrest them for not showing their identification.

A bystander filmed the heavy-handed confrontation, which ended with a policeman snatching a mobile phone from one of the women after she started filming the ordeal in the Victorian capital on Saturday. 

'No, I'm not standing up,' the woman could be heard telling the officers in the footage.

'On what grounds am I under arrest? This is unlawful.'

Five officers were filmed by a bystander swarming around two elderly women sitting on a park bench in the Victorian capital on Saturday

The woman then raised her voice to again ask why she was being arrested. 

'For failing to provide your name and address,' one of the female officers responded.

The woman's friend pulled out her phone to record the encounter, before a male police officer stood behind her and aggressively snatched it from her hand. 

'Excuse me, you have no right to seize my property,' the woman yelled.

 Victoria Police were unable to confirm whether the woman was arrested.

Melbourne residents are currently only allowed to leave home between 5am and 9pm for work, exercise, essential shopping or caregiving. 

Saturday's incident happened while a 'Freedom Day' protest took place in the city.  

Police said seven people were charged with breaching COVID-19 directions after some 200 people gathered to protest near the city centre. 

Scuffles between demonstrators and police resulted in more than 160 fines for contravening lockdown measures or not wearing a mask.

'Despite all the warnings, it was disappointing to see individuals turn out to protest in the city, putting the lives of Victorians at risk,' a police statement said.

Victoria Police charged a protester with assault after an officer suffered cuts to the head during the anti-lockdown rally.

A photographer at the scene said a man punched officers at the city's Shrine of Remembrance before being fitted with a mask and handcuffs.

Later at Albert Park, police reportedly surrounded a group of about 30-50, pushing some to the ground.

Some of the demonstrators carried placards with anti-government sentiments and at one stage were singing the national anthem.

Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday announced stage four lockdown would be extended another two weeks.

Victoria on Monday recorded 41 new COVID-19 cases - the state's lowest daily count in since June 27 - and nine deaths.
