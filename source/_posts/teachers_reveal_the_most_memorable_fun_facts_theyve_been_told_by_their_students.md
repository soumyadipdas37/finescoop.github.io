With the first days of the new school year behind us, teachers have shared some of the funniest and strangest stories their students have shared about themselves and their home lives.

On Reddit, user Kriss0509 posed the question: 'Teachers of Reddit, whats the weirdest thing a student answered to "tell me a fun fact about yourself"?'

The post has received thousands of responses, with educators telling tales of inappropriate admissions, awkward instances of TMI, and revelations of family secrets.

Opening up: With the first days of the new school year behind us, teachers have shared the funniest and strangest 'fun facts' their students have shared about themselves (stock image)

Most of the 'weird' stories were quite funny — like the five-year-old who announced: 'My dad clogged the toilet this morning and that’s why I’m feeling frustrated.'  

'I've had my hand up a sheep's bum,' was a fun fact from another child, who was part of a farming family. 

Meanwhile, a kindergartener told the class, 'My peepee fell off at Disneyland,' with no further explanation.

Some of the stories were about older students. One commenter said that a guy told a whole college class 'how he decided he wanted to study philosophy because one day he was really high peeing in the street and he saw a couple of people working and he wondered what they were doing. So he realized his passion was wondering.'

Several of the stories were just plain strange.  

'We did one of those two truths-one lie bits,' recalled a commenter. 'Girl stands up and says, "I've never been out of the country. I'm a twin. I love playing sports."

The teacher knew the girl didn't have a twin, and said so — but it turned out, she was wrong in a spectacular way.

'She had a conjoined twin that died in utero and had to be surgically removed and she's now missing the last vertebrae on her spine. Showed us the scar and everything. Apparently the lie was the first one as she'd been to Mexico,' the commenter added.

Another student revealed that there is 'a chapter dedicated to him in a dental surgery textbook because of a very rare disorder that he had as a child.'

Then there were the stories that were seriously awkward to hear, like the student who revealed that he had 'been to juvie multiple times and [was] currently on probation. Then he pulled up his pants enough that everyone could see his ankle monitor. That was...something.'

Another commenter wrote: 'A student once told my wife that her daddy had a special device that he had to blow into to start his truck.'

Worse still, though, were the stories that were both horrifying and concerning, from students who didn't seem to realize that some things are not for sharing.

One said: 'I know a lot about medieval torture equipment.'

Another announced: 'I am raising cockroaches in my closet to sell to the reptile shop.'

Yet another commenter recalled a psychology class discussing about the early signs of serial killers when 'the quietest girl who never spoke' suddenly had a story. 

'When she lived in Chicago, she had a friend around 5th grade who would always stomp on baby birds and once put his hamster in the microwave,' the commenter said, 'Well his parents were having difficulty keeping up with his antics so they sent him to his grandmothers, who he promptly stabbed to death when she woke him up for school.'

Meanwhile, one young girl told her teacher that 'she can chug an entire bottle of beer.'

'Someone in a class once told everyone about how his grandparents were arrested for keep a bunch of adopted children in cages,' another commenter wrote. 

'He said that he used to play with the kids when he was young, but he was too young to understand that the conditions they were in weren't normal. They kept kids in cages and locked in rooms for years before they were discovered and arrested.'

Probably the most outrageous-sounding story came from a middle school student, who said that 'his mom and dad have the same parents.' 

When the teacher asked him to clarify, the child said: 'I only have one set of grandparents, they had the same parents.'

The next day, the child backtracked, saying it wasn't that his parents had the same parents, just that they had the same dad.

Still, this was no better, so the teacher was incredibly relieved when she later received a call from the boy's mother, who said that her elderly stepfather married her husband's elderly mother.
