A mum-of-three has unintentionally shared a photo of herself in underwear online after posting a photo of her son's Mario Kart toy collection in a $20 Kmart Lego display.

The mum posted the image to the Kmart Home Décor and Hacks Australia Facebook group, which has more than 326,000 members, but didn't notice her reflection until others pointed it out.

'I obviously didn't look at the photo before posting - I'm an embarrassment to myself, but least I had a top on today,' she wrote online.

The reflection exposed the woman wearing a white striped t-shirt and black underwear while taking a photo of the display.
