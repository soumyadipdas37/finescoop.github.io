A schoolboy has boasted on TikTok about partying in Zante, not wearing a mask and how his mates caught coronavirus before his school was closed.

Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, delayed Wednesday's start of term after 20 students returned from the Greek island with covid.   

The latest cluster and the teenager's showboating TikTok post will only heap more pressure on Boris Johnson to remove Greece from the Government's travel corridor after Wales and Scotland imposed restrictions this week.

In the short clip obtained by The Sun, photos show the group of teens huddled together in a nightclub with the caption: 'Goes to Zante with virtually no social distancing and virtually no corona.'

The TikTok video shows the group huddled together in a nightclub (left) and a schoolboy posing on a flight without his mask on (right)

It then cuts to the schoolboy taking a selfie on a flight with his face mask slung around his chin, with the caption: 'No mask government can't kill me.'

The next shot shows a number of text messages from the NHS, presumably sent to the TikToker and his friends, informing them that they must self-isolate because they have tested positive for coronavirus.  

It was revealed today that headteacher Kay Mountfield made the decision with health officials to delay the start of term last Friday.

She cited Covid-19 infections 'in the school community' and insisted she was 'prioritising safety'.

It is a further blow to the school which was left bruised by the A-Level exams fiasco when 85 per cent of its pupils had marks downgraded.  

Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was set to welcome back pupils today but will now return on September 10

In a newsletter to parents seen by the Maidenhead Advertiser, Ms Mountfield wrote: 'In the last 24 hours, the school has been informed of a number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the school community following travels overseas.'

Her decision to push the reopening back has been supported by Public Health England, Buckinghamshire Council and the Department for Education. 

'All the organisations, along with our Chair of Governors, support my decision to prioritise safety and delay the opening until Thursday, September 10,' she added. 

Ms Mountfield further stressed the need for pupils and parents to observe robust social distancing

Following talks with health officials, headteacher Kay Mountfield decided to squeeze the brakes and broke the news to parents last Friday (school pictured)

This was echoed by the local council, which revealed there had been a cluster of positive tests from young people in the area. 

Buckinghamshire Council tweeted: 'There are some linked cases of coronavirus amongst a group of young people & their families in the Marlow area. 

'All households are isolating, no cause for wider alarm but pls stay vigilant.

'Self-isolate straight away if you get symptoms and follow NHS advice.' 

Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are going back to classes this week after almost six months out of school.
