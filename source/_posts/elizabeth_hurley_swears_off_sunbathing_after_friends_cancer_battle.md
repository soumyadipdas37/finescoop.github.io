Elizabeth Hurley revealed on Tuesday she's sworn off sunbathing for life after seeing her friends battle skin cancer.

The actress, 55, said she 'regrets' the years she spent lounging under the sun and wishes she had keep herself in the shade, even though she 'loathes' staying indoors. 

Despite owning her bespoke Elizabeth Hurley Beach swimwear range, she claimed she now only steps out in the heat if she has slathered herself in factor 30 and has a large hat protecting her from the sun's rays.

Elizabeth regularly posts snaps while wearing just a bikini, including without a hat, but told Grazia: 'I regret ever sunbathing and now use SPF30 and wear a big sunhat.

'I've lost count of how many of my contemporaries have had cancerous cells removed.'

She launched her eponymous brand Elizabeth Hurley Beach at Harrods 15 years ago, and regularly poses for professional photo shoots, as well as being snapped by her sister Kate and 17-year-old son Damian.

Safety first: Despite owning her bespoke Elizabeth Hurley Beach swimwear range, she claimed she now only steps out in the heat if she has slathered herself in factor 30 and has a large hat

The brand sells bikinis with price tags ranging from £144 to £168, while she also sells swimsuits for between £132 and £177, and an array of resortwear.

Elizabeth has a net worth of $50 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, but it is unclear how much of her earnings come from the swimwear range. 

Hurley - whose ex-partner Steve Bing died earlier this year - also said she found lockdown 'liberating' and would only wash her hair for a beachwear shoot.

The mother-of-one added: 'Lockdown was liberating because I didn't constantly check emails and panic about deadlines.

'I only washed my hair when I needed to shoot some beachwear or support a charity.'

She added: 'I loathe staying indoors when it's good weather, but I'm lucky to have some land, so I did at least 40 hours' manual labour a week and bullied everyone else into helping me.'
