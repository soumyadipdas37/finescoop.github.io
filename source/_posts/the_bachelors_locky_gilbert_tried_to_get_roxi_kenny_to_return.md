Roxi Kenny stormed out of The Bachelor mansion after a fiery stoush with her co-star Juliette Herrera on Thursday night.

And on Friday, the 29-year-old revealed Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert called her and tried to convince her to return to the show while she was at the airport.

'I said, 'I'm watching my bags go on the plane it's too late'. He was disappointed. If he did know about it, I think he would have dealt with it,' she told The Courier Mail.

'Once I came home I knew that ship had sailed,' she said.

Roxi also revealed she tearfully left the series after 'something said to me off camera was the straw that broke the camel's back.'

The blonde mechanical engineer decided not to divulge what exactly happened, but spoke of the deep impact it had on her.

'I don't think it's important that people know what was said, but at the same time it was the one thing that pushed me that far over the edge,' she said.

On Thursday night, Roxi dramatically exited the show after a fiery stoush with co-star Juliette Herrera.

The 29-year-old reached boiling point after the two women got into an argument at the cocktail party.

After weeks of feuding with Juliette, Roxi couldn't take anymore of it and decided to leave.

In an expletive-ridden rant, Roxi fired-off at Juliette: 'Really?! There you go again! Honestly! You do my head in.'

A producer intervened with the two women, asking fuming Roxi to calm down.

Roxi then tearfully said she wanted to leave the mansion.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
