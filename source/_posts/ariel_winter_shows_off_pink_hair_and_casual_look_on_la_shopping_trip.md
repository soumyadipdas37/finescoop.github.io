She wowed fans with her new candyfloss-colored hair in a very glam Instagram post earlier this month.

But on Wednesday, Ariel Winter opted for a much more casual look as she went for her weekly grocery run in Los Angeles.

The Modern Family actress had her newly-colored mane tied back in a messy bun, while dressed in an oversized sweater for the outing - and appeared to be just wearing bikini bottoms on her lower half.

She teased her new-look last week with a post, alongside the caption: 'Pinkie Pie spotted in the wild on Labor Day: a slideshow'. 

During coronavirus lockdown, Ariel has been living with her 25-year-old boyfriend Luke Benward. 

The Hollywood star has been dating actor Luke, for around eight months, following her split from boyfriend of three years, Levi Meaden.

Luke is best known for his role as Bo in the Netflix film Dumplin', starring alongside Jennifer Aniston.  

The new couple were first spotted together in early December 2019 and have been going strong since.  

Ariel and Luke spent lockdown together after the coronavirus outbreak reached a fever pitch.

The couple have been sharing several updates to Instagram with the actress showing off her baking skills.    

The duo have also made the thriller Don't Log Off, which was reported to be in production in late July by Deadline. 

The film is a thriller–comedy set in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. It revolves around six friends who attending an online virtual surprise birthday party, only for the birthday girl to go missing.

Ariel announced the project had wrapped on July 31, only two days after it was first reported. 

The star recently completed her role as Alex Dunphy on the hit sitcom Modern Family when the series finale aired on April 8, after 11 seasons.
