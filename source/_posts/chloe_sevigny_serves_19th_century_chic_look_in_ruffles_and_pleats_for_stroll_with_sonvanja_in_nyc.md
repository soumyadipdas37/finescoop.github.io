Chloë Sevigny has been mastering motherhood since welcoming her firstborn back in May with boyfriend Sinisa Mačković. 

And the Golden Globe winner has been continuing to turn some major looks during her walks with son Vanja.

She served another playful 19th century look Tuesday in ruffles and pleats, as she took her newborn baby boy for walk with a friend through the East Village neighborhood of New York City.

The 45-year-old donned a black-and-white houndstooth pinafore with large ruffles down the sides and a pleated mid-length skirt.

She layered the frock over a fitted charcoal short-sleeve top with some chunky black leather ankle boots and matching tube socks.

Chloë finished the look with a white face mask, as she carried a black patent leather handbag, trimmed in white and printed with 'Ciao Bella.'

She was joined by an equally stylish friend, as she walked Vanja in a stroller, before they took a seat on a park bench.

Although the American Psycho actress appeared to be enjoying the outing, she recently admitted to W Magazine that going out these days makes her anxious.

She said: 'I would say that my neuroses around that have really amped up because of the small child and my mother. I guess it’s not even neuroses at this point, it’s just what everybody is doing. It’s common.' 

Chloë added: 'I’m walking around a lot, I like to push him around in the stroller, and a lot of people walk by shouting without masks on.

Secret pregnancy: The veteran 'it' girl revealed that while filming her new series in Italy, she kept her pregnancy a secret from the cast and crew (pictured in March, 2020)

'Like, just put it on! Is it that hard? I know it’s hot and that’s miserable, but bring an extra one so you can change, or don’t shout.'

She also plays a mother in her latest project, the new Luca Guadagnino HBO show We Are Who We Are, which premiered last week.

The veteran 'it' girl revealed that while filming the series in Italy, she kept her pregnancy a secret from the cast and crew.

She explained: 'It was a little awkward. I love going out with the crew and the cast and having drinks, but I was very tired all the time. I wasn’t so sick, but I did have other, hormonal side effects. Navigating that was tricky.'
