London's Heathrow Airport could axe up to 1,200 jobs, around a quarter of its frontline roles, as a result of a downturn in the industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sky News reported on Wednesday.

The airport has informed union officials that it was triggering a 45-day consultation period about the proposed cuts, Sky News said, citing unidentified sources. 

Heathrow has seen passenger numbers drop dramatically during the last six months, with July's traffic reportedly down 95% year-on-year. 

It comes a week after Gatwick announced plans to axe up to 600 jobs in a 'signifcant restructure' after feeling the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on passenger and air traffic numbers.

The airport is operating at around 20 per cent of its capacity and has around 75 per cent of its staff on furlough.

Consultations have begun with staff over redundancies, as it prepares to cut up to 24 per cent of its workforce.

This is a breaking news story. More to come.
