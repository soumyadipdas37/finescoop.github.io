While production is slated to begin this fall on the second season of 9-1-1: Lone Star, lead actress Liv Tyler will not be returning.

Tyler, 43, who played paramedic Emergency Medical Services captain Michelle Blake in the first season of the hit Fox show, will not be back for a second season, due to uncertainties with trans-Atlantic travel, according to Deadline.

The actress lives in London with her husband and her children, and while she was able to commute between London and L.A. in the first season, the global COVID-19 pandemic made it too complicated for her to return.

Tyler had signed a typical multi-year deal when she joined 9-1-1: Lone Star, unlike flagship 9-1-1 star Connie Britton, who left the show after completing her one-year deal.

The show doesn't plan on re-casting Tyler's Michelle Burke, leaving an opening for her to return, though they have already brought on a new character.

Fox announced in early September that Gina Torres had signed on to play new Paramedic captain Tommy Vega in a series regular role for Season 2.

While Tyler's exit was not planned, the end of Season 1 featured a natural conclusion to her character, though Tyler approached producers this summer regarding an exit.

Tyler had flown between London and Los Angeles for filming, with her children joining her in L.A. during vacations, resulting in Tyler never being away from her kids for too long.

Filming was supposed to start this summer while her kids were out of school, but now filming is set to tentatively begin on October 12.

The U.K. also just announced travel restrictions, amid a potential second wave of COVID-19, which may have severely impacted production.

'What a thrill it was having a movie star of Liv Tyler’s stature to help us launch the first season of 9-1-1: Lone Star,' series co-creator/executive producer/showrunner Tim Minear said in a statement. 

'We loved working with Liv and will be forever indebted to her for her haunting, powerful portrayal of Michelle Blake,' he added.

'While we were able to tell a complete chapter in Michelle’s story, as with Connie Britton on our mothership, we also feel like there are more stories to be told. The door here will always be open for a return,' Minear concluded.

Tyler was last seen on the big screen alongside Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones in the outer space thriller Ad Astra.

She also recently starred on the Hulu series Harlots alongside Lesley Manville and Samantha Morton.
