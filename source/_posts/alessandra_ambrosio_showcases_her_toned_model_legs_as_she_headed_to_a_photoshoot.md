 'I've always tried to keep my beauty routine as simple as possible and that didn't change when I had my kids,' she said. 'What I've focused on since having kids is creating time to take care of myself.' 

Adding: 'Even if it's just 15 minutes in the morning for meditation, stretching or yoga - it helps me get centered and ready to conquer whatever the day is bringing my way.'

She is determined to ensure her kids learn the value of taking care of themselves, too.

The model told Vogue India magazine: 'I make sure that I teach my kids the importance of taking care of themselves, so every morning we make delicious juices together and try to do some kind of outdoor activity.'
