A paedophile who was jailed for sexually assaulting his 11-year-old stepdaughter said his abhorrent behaviour was the result of a 'brain snap'.

The Victorian man, who cannot be named to protect the child's identity, faced the County Court on Thursday and pleaded guilty to performing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 and incest with a child of a defacto spouse.

The court heard how in 2013 he climbed into his bed while the girl was watching TV and put her hand into his pants. 

Days later he sexually assaulted the 11-year-old a second time, The Herald Sun reported. 

After confiding in her mother in 2018 the victim submitted a police statement and her mum left her stepfather. 

The man was evaluated by forensic psychologist David Ball who said the offender couldn't give 'meaningful insight' for his actions. 

'I don't know, she basically got onto me. I did try and stop. I don't know what happened. I had a brain snap,' he told Dr Ball.

He also made the sickening claim that if his stepdaughter was going to 'engage in this sort of behaviour it was better that she did it with (him) then with someone else'.

Judge George Georgiou said the man betrayed his stepdaughter and the 'position of trust' he held as her stepfather. 

'You breached that trust for no other reason it will seem other than your own sexual gratification,' Judge Georgiou said.

The stepdaughter still suffers from depression and anxiety as a result of the sexual assaults and said nightmares continue to keep her awake at night.  

The man was sentenced to a maximum five years jail with a minimum of three years served before he is eligible for parole.
