A furious Joe Biden called Donald Trump's reported comments on American troops 'disgusting' and called on the president to apologize to Gold Star families who lost a loved one in service to the country.

Biden used several tough words to condemn the president in one of his harshest attacks to date on Trump: 'sick, disgrace, deplorable, un-American, unpatriotic.'

He said if the reported comments were accurate then they were 'absolutely damnable.'   

'It's a disgrace,' he added.

Biden, scheduled to give an economic speech, instead started off by blasting Trump for a report in The Atlantic that quoted unnamed military sources claiming the president called those who served in the military and died in uniform were 'losers' and suckers.'

Noting his son, Beau, served in the Army, Biden pounded the podium as he roared against Trump, demanding 'who the heck does he think he is?'

'Let me be real clear. When my son was an assistant U.S. Attorney and volunteered to go to Kosovo while the war was going on as a civilian, he wasn't a sucker. My son volunteered and joined the United States military as the attorney general, went to Iraq for a year, won the bronze star and other commendations. He wasn't a sucker,' Biden said, his voice growing louder as he spoke.

'The service men and women he served with, particularly those that didn't come home, were not losers. If these statements are true, the president should humbly apologize to every Gold Star mother and father, every Blue Star family that he's denigrated and insulted. Who the heck does he think he is?,' he said. 

Beau Biden served in the Delaware Army National Guard. For his service in Iraq - from October 2008 to September 2009 - he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. After Beau died in 2015 of brain cancer, Army Chief of Staff Raymond Odierno delivered the eulogy at his funeral and presented a posthumous Legion of Merit for his service.

'I'm always cautioned not to lose my temper,' Biden said of his criticism of Trump. 'This may be as close as I come this campaign.' 

'Just a marker of how deeply President Trump and I disagree about the role of the president of the United States of America,' he added. 

He said he carries his son's medal with him but was too emotional to bring it with him to his speech, afraid of what he'd say. 

'I carry and I deliberately didn't bring with me today, Delaware National Guard had a pin made up that is a gold star made up for my son, Beau,' he said.  'I always carry it with me. I didn't carry it today because I was worried that if I focused too much on it that I would engage in some of the kind of language that the president has used. I just think it is sick. It is deplorable. It's so un-American. It's so unpatriotic.'

He said it was the government's responsibility to care for and honor American service members and Trump failed in that obligation.

'We have one truly sacred obligation. Equip and support those we send in harm's way, care for families while they're gone and care for them when they're home. The only truly sacred obligation the government has. Duty, honor, country. These are values that drive our service members. It's an all voluntary outfit. President Trump has demonstrated he has no sense of service. No loyalty to any cause other than himself,' he said.

Joe Biden said he carries his son Beau's medal with him every day but didn't bring it to his speech as he was afraid it would set him off even more

He went on to praise American troops as the 'backbone of America.' 

'These folks are the backbone of America. They're the heart, the soul, the grit. That's what patriotism is about. I've just never been disappointed in my whole career with a leader that I have worked with, president or otherwise that if the article is true and a appears to be based on the things he said, it's absolutely damnable. It's a disgrace,' he said. 

Meanwhile, the White House is furiously fighting back against the politically explosive report that the president called U.S. military heroes killed in battle 'losers' and 'suckers' – and turned down a trip to visit U.S. war dead in France due to the rain.

President Trump rejoined the fray on Friday, attacking the Atlantic magazine, which published the report that he termed 'fake.' 

'The Atlantic Magazine is dying, like most magazines, so they make up a fake story in order to gain some relevance,' Trump tweeted. 'Story already refuted, but this is what we are up against. Just like the Fake Dossier. You fight and and fight, and then people realize it was a total fraud!' Trump continued.

Trump ripped the report as he met with the president of Serbia and the prime minister of Kosovo at the White House Friday.

'It was a terrible thing that somebody could say the kind of things – especially to me, because I’ve done more for the mil than almost anybody else,' Trump fumed. 'Nobody’s done what I’ve done' for the military, Trump claimed.

Then he brought up the tell-all book by former national security advisor John Bolton – a book that accuses Trump of giving 'personal favors to dictators.'   

'I hate to bring up his book, but john Bolton, no friend of mine I mean he didn’t know too much about what he was doing, he didn’t do a good job. But he wrote a book. He talks about this incident and he doesn’t mention it,' said Trump.

'There’s nobody that considers the military and especially the people that have given their lives in the military – to me they’re heroes,' Trump said of Americans who die while serving the country. 'It’s even hard to believe how they could do it. And I say that. The level of bravery ...' he said.    

In addition to the president himself calling the story in the Atlantic fill of 'lies,' the White House communications shop has turned to an unlikely source of defense: Bolton, who Trump has ridiculed since his slicing memoir.

'He is a liar,' Trump said after Bolton released his tell-all book trashing the administration.

Following publication of the Atlantic story, the White House press shop retweeted an image of Bolton's book, 'The Room Where it Happened,' where Bolton says it was bad weather and the special contingencies of presidential travel that caused the White House to nix a planned cemetery visit by Trump in 2018.

Trump was to have visited the cemetery near Belleau Wood on the 100th anniversary which holds a special place for Marines. 

'The press turned canceling the cemetery visit into a story that Trump was afraid of the rain and took glee in pointing out that other world leaders traveled around during the day,' Bolton wrote. 'Of course, none of them were the President of the United States, but the press didn't understand the rules for US Presidents are different form the rules for 190 other leaders who don't command the world's greatest military forces.'

Bolton wrote that Marine One's crew were saying it was 'imprudent' to fly by helicopter due to the weather, and the drive could be 90 minutes each way. 

The Atlantic piece takes a much harsher view: 'Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day,' wrote author Jeffrey Goldberg.

White House deputy communications director Brian Morganstern retweeted the passage book, as did White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah. 

Farah also called the article 'offensive & patently false.' 

Another White House press official, Judd Deere, blasted out people who contradicted accounts in the article.

'Anyone else notice that there are now four individuals with first-hand knowledge who are ON THE RECORD denying The Atlantic story? This matches the publications four anonymous sources. Will The Atlantic stand by their false anonymous reporting or listen to those who were there?'

A senior Defense Department official with first-hand knowledge of events and a senior Marine Corps officer who was told about them confirmed the accounts to the Associated Press – 'including the cemetery incident.' 

'This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!' Trump tweeted Thursday.

Trump fumed late Thursday upon his return from a speech in Pennsylvania: ''I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes.'

'There is nobody that respects them more. No animal - nobody - what animal would say such a thing?' Trump added.  

The Joe Biden campaign ran with the story and blasted Trump in a Friday conference call.

'I'd take my wheelchair and titanium legs over Donald Trump's supposed bone spurs any day,' said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who lost her legs in a plane accident in Iraq. She was referencing Trump's deferments during Vietnam due to bone spurs.

'It's time for this man to leave office,' she added.

'His soul cannot conceive of integrity and honor,' said Gold Star father Khizr Khan, whose son Humayun Khan was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2004 and whose Democratic convention speech prompted extended back-and-forth with Trump. 'His soul is that of a coward,' Khan said. 

Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who has been released from prison, tweeted that the Atlantic article 'is accurate.'

'I testified, “Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur. When I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He finished with: ‘You think I’m stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam.”'

The report, published by the Atlantic Thursday, credits four separate military sources, and claims that Trump cancelled a visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in November 2018 because he was worried his hair would be disheveled by the rain.

In a conversation with senior staff before the planned visit, Trump reportedly asked aides: 'Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.'

During the same trip, the president allegedly later referred to the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives in the Battle of Belleau Wood in France as 'suckers' for getting killed. 

A senior Defense Department official with firsthand knowledge of events and a senior U.S. Marine Corps officer who was told about Trump's comments confirmed some of the remarks to The Associated Press, including the 2018 cemetery comments. 

Trump, however, has emphatically denied the report Thursday night, calling it 'a disgraceful situation' by a 'terrible magazine.' 

'It's a total lie. It's fake news. It's a disgrace, and frankly it's a disgrace to your profession,' Trump said.

Trump vehemently denied the claims, which were first reported in the Atlantic , that he referred to the American war dead at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery (above) in France in 2018 as 'losers' and 'suckers.'

The president's alleged comments are in stark contrast to Trump's public persona as a self-proclaimed champion of the military and its veterans. 

A source described to have first-hand knowledge of the president's views said Trump 'doesn't see the heroism in fighting'. Other sources said Trump is deeply anxious about dying or being disfigured, and that fear manifests itself as disgust for those who have suffered. 

The day of the planned visit at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, November 10, 2018, was also the 243rd birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps. 

The Battle of Belleau Wood, which lasted 20 days in June 1918 and ended with German forces soundly defeated, was a defining moment in World War I for the Marine Corps. 

But Trump, on the same trip, reportedly asked aides, 'Who were the good guys in this war?' He also said that he didn't understand why the United States would intervene on the side of the Allies, the Atlantic reported.

Speaking to reporters Thursday, Trump said he's be 'willing to swear on anything'  that he never said anything derogatory 'about our fallen heroes.' 

'There is nobody that respects them more. No animal — nobody — what animal would say such a thing?' 

He also wanted to go to the cemetery in France but said he was unable to because of heavy rainfall in Paris, and that the U.S. Secret Service would not allow him to motorcade there.  

'The helicopter could not fly. The reason it couldn't fly, because it was raining as hard as I'd ever seen. And on top of that it was very, very foggy,' Trump said on Thursday.

He added that staffers tried to arrange a motorcade, but that it would have meant going through busy parts of Paris.

'The Secret Service told me, you can't do it. I said I have to do it. They said you can't do it,' Trump said. 

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, also decried the report, saying 'It's sad the depths that people will go to during a lead-up to a presidential campaign to try to smear somebody.'  

Trump was meant to join John Kelly in paying his respects to Kelly's son's grave and comfort the families of other fallen service members in Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day, 2017 (above). However, Trump reportedly turned to Kelly and said: 'I don't get it. What's in it for them?'

In another account, detailed by the Atlantic, the president told senior advisers that he didn't understand why the U.S. government placed such value on finding soldiers missing in action because they had performed poorly and gotten caught and deserved what they got, a source said.

The president allegedly said that those who served in the Vietnam War were also 'losers' because they failed to dodge the draft. Trump received a medical deferment from Vietnam over alleged bone spurs.

In a conversation with then-Chief of Staff John Kelly, Trump reportedly complained bitterly that he didn't understand why John McCain, who was imprisoned and tortured during Vietnam, was so revered.

'Isn't he kind of a loser?' Trump asked, according to the four sources.

Trump has previously derided McCain's legacy as a war hero publicly. On the 2016 presidential campaign trail in Iowa, Trump said: 'He's not a war hero. I like people who weren't captured.'

At the same event, Trump said 'I don't like losers' referencing McCain losing the 2008 presidential election to Barack Obama.

'I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But, you know, he lost. So I have never liked him as much after that, because I don't like losers,' he said.  

The senior Marine Corps officer and the Atlantic, citing sources with firsthand knowledge, further reported that Trump said he didn't want to support the August 2018 funeral of Republican Sen. John McCain.

The Atlantic reported that Trump was also angered that flags were flown at half-staff for McCain, saying: 'What the f*** are we doing that for? Guy was a f***ing loser.'

Trump acknowledged Thursday he was 'never a fan' of McCain and disagreed with him, but said he still respected him and approved everything to do with his 'first-class triple-A funeral' without hesitation because 'I felt he deserved it.' 

The magazine said Trump also referred to former President George H.W. Bush as a 'loser' because he was shot down by the Japanese as a Navy pilot in World War II.

The Atlantic also details another exchange between Trump and Kelly on Memorial Day, 2017, at the graveside of Kelly's son, Robert, who died at 29 years old in Afghanistan in 2010. 

Trump was meant to join Kelly in paying his respects to Robert's grave and comfort the families of other fallen service members. 

However, Trump reportedly turned to Kelly at his son's graveside and said: 'I don't get it. What's in it for them?' 

The Defense officials also confirmed to The AP that the Trump made the remarks.

One of Kelly's friends, who is a four-star general, told the Atlantic: '[Trump] can't fathom the idea of doing something for someone other than himself. He just thinks that anyone who does anything when there's no direct personal gain to be had is a sucker. There's no money in serving the nation.

'Trump can't imagine anyone else's pain. That's why he would say this to the father of a fallen marine on Memorial Day in the cemetery where he's buried,' the source continued.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday, 'If the revelations in today's Atlantic article are true, then they are yet another marker of how deeply President Trump and I disagree about the role of the President of the United States.'

'Duty, honor, country — those are the values that drive our service members,' he said in a statement Thursday night, adding that if he is elected president, 'I will ensure that our American heroes know that I will have their back and honor their sacrifice — always.' Biden's son Beau served in Iraq in 2008-09.
