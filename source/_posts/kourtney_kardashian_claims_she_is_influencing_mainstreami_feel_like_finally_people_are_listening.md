Kourtney Kardashian is delighted that her clean living habits such as eating organic food are now becoming mainstream.

The 41-year-old reality TV star launched her own lifestyle website and brand Poosh in April 2019 and she feels as though many of the things she has been advocating for a healthy lifestyle are now becoming 'normal' and that is a sign of positive change.

'I feel like finally people are listening to me,' she told WWD. 'It's frustrating to feel like it's kind of this weird thing to eat organically or things that to me are pretty standard in self-care, so I think now it's become normal in a way and I'm just happy that it's catching on.'

Making a difference: Kourtney Kardashian is delighted that her clean living habits such as eating organic food are now becoming mainstream she told WWD

Her work is important: 'I feel like finally people are listening to me,' she said. 'It's frustrating to feel like it's kind of this weird thing to eat organically or things that to me are pretty standard in self-care, so I think now it's become normal in a way and I'm just happy that it's catching on'

The ex of Scott Disick added, 'My goal when I started Poosh was really to be able to provide (wellness) information in a non-judgmental way ... I'm surprised at how much I'm learning with this whole experience.'

Poosh offers expert advice and opinions across a range of topics such as fitness, diet, sexual health and beauty tips.

Kourtney believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has made people reassess their lifestyles and habits and made them realize that they need to get healthier, which has made Poosh more relevant than ever before.

She added: 'Especially during this time, health and wellness are such important things. It's even more important to take care of yourself.'

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and her famous friends, such as Miranda Kerr and Malika Haqq, have become even more committed to clean living since becoming mothers because they want to set a good example to their kids.

Kourtney - who has three children, son Mason, 10, daughter Penelope, eight, and son Reign, five - said: 'Just as moms, we're modelling to our kids what ways we take care of ourselves.

'It's funny because the foods I eat or different things, I'll notice my kids will tend to have an interest in that.'

This interview comes after news that Keeping Up With The Kardashians was coming to an end on E! after more than a decade.

Keeping Up With The Kardashians soldiered on for 18 seasons after it first started in 2007 and made superstars out of Kourtney and all five of her siblings.

Early last week a Page Six report alleged Kourtney's little sister Khloe, as well as Scott, were against the cancellation of the show.

By way of explaining their opposition to the cancellation the insider said: 'Some of them needed the money more than others.'

Although there were rumors that Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, as well as Kylie Jenner, pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.

The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.

Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun : 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'

To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'

However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.
