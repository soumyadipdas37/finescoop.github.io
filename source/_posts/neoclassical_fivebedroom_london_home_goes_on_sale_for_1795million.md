A 19th century, neoclassical home designed by royal architect John Nash has gone on the market for a staggering £17.95million.

The Grade-I, five-bedroom property on Hanover Terrace in Regent's Park, which is home to some of London's elite, was once owned by Rothschild tycoon Baron Solomon Benedict de Worms, the creator of the Rothschild Tea Estate in Sri Lanka and dubbed one of the 'founding fathers of British tea'.

Solomon's grandfather was Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty - a family which possessed the largest private fortune in the world during the 19th century. 

Designed by neoclassical architect John Nash, who is the mind behind Buckingham Palace, the white-stucco house was built in 1822-23 by John Mackell Aitkins.

The 6,469 square foot property has recently undergone a detailed refurbishment and now boasts a lavish drawing room and library, dining room, sitting room and family kitchen - as well as a a gymnasium, wine cellar and plenty of bathroom suites.

Built as part of a Palladian terrace of 20 grand houses, named after the Viceroy of Hanover and created by the Crown Estate for the family and friends of His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, the house’s exterior offers classical grandeur, such as imposing columns and elegant sculptures that stand atop each of its three corners.

It comes complete with a west facing rear garden and an elegant ‘tea house’ with beautiful mosaic floor, which was used by Solomon and his wife every day for afternoon tea.

Frankfurt born and London based, Solomon married heiress Henrietta Samuel, the daughter of banker Samuel Moses Samuel, on July 11 1827, with the house on Hanover Terrace serving as the couple's new marital home. 

Solomon and his brothers Maurice and Gabriel made their fortune by setting up the Rothschild Tea Estate, a vast 2,000 acre tea plantation in Sri Lanka in 1841.

Tea plants had been brought to Sri Lanka by the British from China in 1824 and over the following decades tea production in the country increased dramatically so that by 1899 the area under cultivation exceeded 400,000 acres.

Between 1840 and 1865 Solomon spent time in Sri Lanka building up the family’s tea plantations and factories, before cleverly marketing tea in Britain as a healthy beverage for the aristocracy and the middle-class.

In 1871, Solomon was created 1st Baron de Worms by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, for services to industry, and in 1874 the tea-loving Queen Victoria gave him special dispensation to use his Austrian title in Britain where it was recognised at Court.

Meanwhile, the incredible London property also provides staff accommodation on the lower ground floor, a media room and breakfast room (pictured)

 Alex Bourne, Director at Beauchamp Estates, said: 'This outstanding trophy house (pictured is one of the hallways) is a turn-key residence which benefits from a full restoration and detailed refurbishment'

Solomon died in 1882 aged 81 and he and his brothers were succeeded in the tea business by Solomon’s son Henry, who became the 1st Baron Pirbright.

Meanwhile, the property also provides staff accommodation on the lower ground floor, a media room and breakfast room, while the master bedroom suite occupies its own private floor on the second level. It features a large bedroom, walk-in dressing room and a master bathroom. 

The 8-10 seat dining room and sitting room on the ground floor lead into the adjoining kitchen and breakfast room which opens onto a balcony leading down to the stunning garden.

He bequeathed his wealth and established an international banking family through his five sons in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, and Naples.

During the 19th century, the Rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world.

Baron Solomon Benedict de Worms, grandson of Mayer Amschel, and his brothers Maurice and Gabriel made their fortune by setting up the Rothschild Tea Estate, a vast 2,000 acre tea plantation in Sri Lanka in 1841.

Gary Hersham, Founder of Beauchamp Estates, who is selling the property, said: 'This magnificent Hanover Terrace house was once the home of Rothschild tea tycoon Baron Solomon Benedict de Worms, the founder of the Rothschild Tea Estate in Sri Lanka, and one of the "founding fathers of British tea". 

'The property even has its own "tea house" at the end of the spacious garden where the Rothschilds used to sit and take tea each afternoon. Tea remains the iconic British beverage, in Britain we drink 165million cups of tea a day, enough to fill 20 Olympic swimming pools.'

Alex Bourne, Director at Beauchamp Estates, added: 'This outstanding trophy house is a turn-key residence which benefits from a full restoration and detailed refurbishment. 

'It is presented to an extremely high standard with a luxurious interior design and dressing. This expansive residence is designed for exquisite luxury living and offers the space and facilities to provide a discerning buyer with a perfect family home.'

John Nash, pictured, was a prominent royal architect in the late 1700s and early 1800s, working on Buckingham Palace, Regent's Park and Trafalgar Square

John Nash, remembered for his work on Buckingham Palace, Regent's Park and Regent Street in London, is one of the most famous architects of the 18th and early 19th centuries.

He was born in January 1752 and after an early education received training from the architect Sir Robert Taylor before launching his career as a surveyor and builder in the city of London. 

In 1777 Nash established his own business and later inherited £1,000 from an uncle which he decided to risk on the building of houses in Great Russell Street and Bloomsbury Square. The buildings failed to rent out and Nash was declared bankrupt in 1783. 

Returning to London in 1797, Nash then designed a number of Gothic castles around the country, in places such as Luscombe Castle in Devon and Caerahays Castle in Cornwall.

Nash soon came under the patronage of the Prince Regent, later King George IV. In 1806 he was appointed Surveyor General of Woods, Forests and Parks and from 1810 onwards worked solely for the prince. 

By 1813 he had been appointed official architect to the Office of Works, which meant advising parliamentary commissions on things such as new church buildings. This was when he designed Regent's Park, Buckingham Palace and two theatres in Haymarket.

He also drew up the original plans for what is now Trafalgar Square, although he died before the project was completed and it was taken over by Charles Barry.

Among his other works were changing a canal in St James's Park into the lake it is today and he also redesigned the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.

When George IV died in 1830, Nash lost his royal protector amid a backlash about the extravagance of the King's reign. 

Buckingham Palace had cost thousands, millions in today's terms, and Nash ultimately retired. He died a few years later in May 1835.
