Aubrey O'Day was spotted flaunting her bikini body at a hotel pool where she looked very different from the filtered photos she posts online.

The singer of girl group Danity Kane was seen enjoying the pool at the Holiday House in Palm Springs during the week of August 24 while wearing a black bikini, mesh skirt and baseball hat. This was the same week she was snapped walking her dogs in photos where she appeared unrecognizable. 

Guests at the pool said there is no question that it was Aubrey, as she proclaimed loud and proud to other guests exactly who she was.   

'She was telling other people and myself loudly her name, that she is a singer and a celebrity and that she was on Celebrity Apprentice and Big Brother,' a guest told DailyMailTV.

'She was at the pool pretty much all day, every day and even when we were there at midnight for a night swim. She was alone the entire time and would spend hours on her phone scrolling and smiling at her phone.'

It appears these pool photos are proof that the paparazzi pictures circulating last week are real, as the singer has been calling them fake and playing defense on social media by posting bathing suit shots where she looks much more slender.

The photos were snapped the week of August 24 and the singer was seen in a black bikini and baseball hat

Sources at the pool said Aubrey proclaimed loudly to other guests exactly who she was and wasn't trying to remain low key at all 

'She was telling other people and myself loudly her name, that she is a singer and a celebrity and that she was on Celebrity Apprentice and Big Brother,' a source told DailyMail.com

The 'unrecognizable' photos of Aubrey walking her dogs were taken the same weekend that she was spotted at the pool. 

After the initial photos were published last week, Aubrey and her lawyer stated the photos were fake and then took to Twitter and Instagram to show off a more slender frame.  

In one snap she posed in a high-leg purple swimsuit, looking much more fit than the paparazzi shots. However, she did have a heavy filter applied to her video, which applied a flower garland to her head, heavy make-up and speckles of light. 

In another post, she showed a 'proof of life' photo, with the date written where she looks much slimmer than the candid shots.   

She wrote that she was getting her lawyers involved and called the original photos 'click bait'.  

But in the unfiltered photos from the pool, Aubrey more closely resembles the alleged 'fake' photos. 

'Aubrey's post speaks for itself,' her lawyer Ben Walter told Page Six. 'The person in the paparazzi photos is not the same person in the picture that Aubrey shared on Instagram, in that the photo has been altered in an unflattering manner. It's clear to see that there are noticeable differences between the two photos.' 

Aubrey told one hotel guest that she couldn't be seen in West Hollywood in a bathing suit because 'it will end up on TMZ'

Aubrey told one hotel guest that she couldn't be seen in West Hollywood in a bathing suit because 'it will end up on TMZ'.  

'Yet we all found it odd that she was bragging about who she was and wasn't trying to be low key at all, while also tagging her location at the hotel,' the source added.   

'When I would look at her Instagram stories when we were there she would post from the pool at night (not showing herself) and I could even hear my voice in the background. 

'Yet shortly after she would post what must be a completely old photo of herself pretending to be at the pool but it was not the same location that we were actually at,' the source revealed.

 Aubrey posted this snap of herself looking trim in a swimsuit as she advertised the Flat Tummy App on August 20

Aubrey's initial sighting came just a week after she posted an advertisement for the Flat Tummy App on her Instagram account that showed her in a revealing swimsuit, though it appears to have been heavily airbrushed.  

'Can't wait to see the progress as I continue the workouts,' Aubrey captioned the snap from August 20, which she posted to her 936,000 followers. 'Nothing beats a poolside workout, and with my new @flattummyapp I can do my workout anywhere, anytime.'

What was recognizable about the 5′ 4″ star's appearance was her tattoos. Aubrey has previously shown off her bar code neck tattoo, and Latin scripture ink on her torso.

The Latin slogan emblazoned on her side reads: 'Per aspera ad astra,' loosely translated as 'through hardships to the stars.'
