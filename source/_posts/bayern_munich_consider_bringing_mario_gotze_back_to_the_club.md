Bayern Munich are reportedly weighing up a sensational move to bring Mario Gotze back to the club after he left rivals Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer.

The 28-year-old, who scored Germany's winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final, is currently a free agent after his contract with Dortmund expired earlier this summer after another frustrating campaign. 

Gotze was lured away from Dortmund by Bayern and Pep Guardiola in the summer of 2013 when he was one of the hottest prospects in European football but failed to make an impact in Bavaria and returned to his former club in 2016.

But Gotze only managed 21 appearances last season and the club decided not to offer him a new deal.

According to German outlet BILD, Bayern are interested in bringing him back to the Allianz Arena.

Hansi Flick reportedly called Gotze last week to discuss the possibility of the return and it was not their first call to discuss the player's future. 

The Bayern boss is keen to bolster his squad with such a busy schedule this season caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 

He has so far only added Leroy Sane to his all-conquering squad but Thiago, Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Perisic have all departed the club.

Gotze is an attractive proposition because he knows the club and the Bundesliga well and would not cost a transfer fee. 

Gotze recently admitted he would only be interested in signing for a club where he could win the Champions League.

'The financial aspect only plays a subordinate role for me,' he told BILD.

'The decisive and really important factors are the athletes. I have ambitious goals and I really want to win the Champions League.'

Upon his return to Dortmund in 2016, Gotze couldn't recapture his previous form at Signal Iduna Park as he was hit by a host of injuries problems and fitness issues - playing just 15 times in the Bundesliga in his final season. 

In May the club announced he would be leaving on a free transfer, with sporting director Michael Zorc calling it 'a mutual and respectful decision'.

This summer he has been linked with a move to the MLS to join David Beckham's side Inter Miami, but the German is said to favour staying in Europe.

Bild have reported that Gotze was approached by the MLS franchise with a £5.3million a year salary, but they were turned down. 

West Ham have also been mentioned as a possible destination for Gotze, with the Hammers keen to bring in big names and push for a European spot.  

Meanwhile, Monaco, Sevilla, Fiorentina, AC Milan and Roma are all understood to have expressed interest in the creative midfielder.
