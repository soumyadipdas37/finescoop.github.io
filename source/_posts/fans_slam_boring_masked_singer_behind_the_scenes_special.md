On Tuesday night, The Masked Singer aired it's Unmasked special. 

And it appears the episode left many fans bored, with some calling it 'filler' and a 'yawn'. 

As of August 22, production was shut down due to a coronavirus outbreak, meaning that filming on the finale was delayed.

That left the network scrambling for content for this week, which should have featured the final three - Bushranger, Frillneck and Queen - battling for the crown. 

Instead, the episode featured a look at what goes on off stage, including costume design and interviews with the judges.  

Confused fans shared their annoyance on Twitter, with some not aware they were watching a behind-the-scenes episode until they were most of the way through.

One person Tweeted: 'Is this just a filler episode to push back content because of the COVID lockdown? SMH should I just turn off the TV?' 

One more agreed:  'So we're 45 minutes into #MaskedSingerAU and we're still stuck in the 'previously on...' part of the episode'. 

Yet another complained: 'Is anyone gonna sing, or get unmasked tonight?'













Oh dear: It appears the episode left many fans bored, with some calling it 'filler' and a 'yawn'

Another added: 'That's it switching off they know if they advertised the format of this show people would NEVER have tuned in. Turn.It.Off.'  

Someone else chimed in:  'There's more padding in this #MaskedSingerAU finale than in any of the elaborate costumes.'

One more agreed: 'Switching channels briefly to the yawnfest that is tonight's #MaskedSingerAU, I'm glad I'm watching #PlateOfOrigin'.
