Jamie Laing has revealed he was asked to be Spencer Matthews and Vogue William's newborn daughter Gigi's god father by the couple.

The Made In Chelsea star, 31, and his former co-star, 32, have been pals for years and previously appeared on the hit E4 reality show together until Spencer left in 2015.

Despite leaving the show, Spencer and Jamie have remained thick as thieves and the TV star has now entrusted his pal to be god father to his baby girl.

Announcing the happy news on his Instagram page, Jamie shared his first snap with the newborn as he cradled her in his arms at the Matthews' apartment.

He captioned the image: 'My first picture ever taken with my gorgeous, beautiful God Daughter Gigi Margaux Matthews...'

Previously gushing over their close friendship to MailOnline, Jamie said: 'Spence is one of my best friends in the entire world, and has been for 10, 12, 15 years... I absolutely adore Vogue and their show was just hilarious. 

'They are such a great couple with each other, it [their series] shows couples can argue and bicker, and be funny with each other, and still be completely in love - and I love that!'

Happy: Spencer and Vogue previously revealed that their son Theodore, 23 months, has five godparents, one of whom is the Duchess Cambridge's brother, James Middleton

Spencer and Vogue previously revealed that their son Theodore, 23 months, has five godparents, one of whom is the Duchess Cambridge's brother, James Middleton.

Speaking to VIP magazine, Spencer said: 'Vogue went down the family route, her sister Amber is his godmother, my sister Nina is also godmother and then a few of my pals, Max Keble White, my cousin Rob Parker and James Middleton will be his godfathers, not a bad crowd.

'It's more a nod to our close friends and a nod to their reliability and responsibility. A little gold star on a very good friend.'

Spencer recently confirmed he and wife Vogue, who welcomed Gigi in July,  will be having more kids in the future, only if she allows him to hire a live-in nanny.

During the first episode of their eponymous podcast, the former reality star also stressed the 'necessity' of childcare for working parents.

Responding to fans' queries about growing their family, presenter Vogue confirmed: 'Yes we will be. Not yet though', before the reality star added: 'Depending on the nanny's availability and whether or not she can move in permanently. I won't do it otherwise.'

The Heart Radio star shared the details of their agreement as she said: 'Spenny did actually say that, that we could have four kids if I swore that we could have a live-in nanny by the time we had four kids. 

'It's different for Irish people I think because we don't do the whole night nanny thing, and all that stuff, you don't hear about that at home, but here, you have maternity nurses, night nannies and stuff like that and we just don't have that.'

'If one of us didn't work, then we wouldn't have a nanny': The media personality also stressed the 'necessity' of childcare for working parents

Spencer left his long-term partner in giggles as he joked he'd wear 'condoms every time' if she tries to have a third baby without a live-in nanny, with the blonde sarcastically replying: 'Good luck, I'd be really into that, we can start doing that right now because I'd rather not go on the pill.'

When asked whether they currently receive help with their children, the former Lothario said: 'Yes, obviously. 

'And it's not even a pompous like, obviously, it's how can two adults who work, full time, look after kids as well. It's a necessity, of day to day life. If one of us didn't work, then we wouldn't have a nanny, given that we work. 

'Without being rude but I don't compare myself to other people. I have my mission in life and the things I want to achieve, and a nanny is very much a part of that.'

'But if you saw me complaining online, about being a mum and having a job… what would you think about me?', the mother-of-two asked, with the TV star replying: 'I'd say why don't you get the nanny to do more?' 

The Irish model continued to reason: 'No I think we would, being a stay at home mum is, obviously, I've been home since Gigi's been born because we're getting into the swing of things.

'I do think it's good to remember that we are in a position that is very privileged to have a nanny because you see some people complaining about work and motherhood.

'Babe you've got a nanny at home so you can't really complain because there's some people with a husband who will go to work and the mother will mind the kids, and then the mother goes to work and the husband minds the kids.

'They have to do a cycle like that, so actually not everyone has a nanny or can afford one, so I think it's important to realise that actually we're really lucky.'
