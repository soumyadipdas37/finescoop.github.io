She's pondering life's deepest questions on social media.

And Britney Spears asked her 26million Instagram followers if they are 'truly happy' in a post shared on Wednesday afternoon.

The 38-year-old legend admitted she was finding ways to give herself 'more self-love' while posing in one of her signature crop tops.

'Just a Touch of Rose,' she started a lengthy caption. 'Ask yourself today … am I truly happy ??? What makes you happy ... coffee early in the morning ??? Dancing for hours ??? Making lots of plans for the day then canceling???'

The Piece of Me songstress looked stellar wearing minimal makeup with a thin black choker wrapped around her neck.

Her long blonde hair rested across her shoulders with piece of fringe framing her face in the sweet selfie.

Over? Britney revealed in new court filings obtained by TMZ that she's done with live performances — at least for the time being

Britney revealed in new court filings obtained by TMZ that she's done with live performances — at least for the time being.

She made the disclosure as her battle with her father Jamie Spears has intensified over her ongoing conservatorship.

Jamie has been at the helm of Britney's affairs for more than 10 years following her involuntary psychiatric hold in 2008.

In her documents, the singer objected to her father's attempts to bring back Andrew Wallet as a co-conservator, a job he held from 2008–2019.

But dad Jamie has hit back, claiming Britney's stated objections to Wallet's appointment are inaccurate and requesting a hearing to determine the facts in his own legal docs.

The pop star has recently been trying to unseal court documents so that the public could see them, and her lawyer expressed support for the #FreeBritney movement earlier this month.
