Chris and Rosie Ramsey have joked they decided to have a second child because they 'got a little bit bored' during lockdown.

The comedian, 34, and his other half, 33, who are parents to son Robin, four, are expecting a baby and admitted they are scared of plunging back into the world of nappies and midnight feedings.

Speaking on Heart Breakfast, Rosie said: 'We got a little bit bored during lockdown, so we decided to fornicate and make a baby.'

Chris then added: 'You can’t say fornicate at this time in the morning!'

Rosie said: 'We got a bit bored one day and thought why not, so little baby Ramsey number two is coming in January.'

Host Amanda Holden told the couple they planned the timing of Rosie's pregnancy well as their son is going back to school.

She said: 'You see, that is so perfect he’s at school or going to school and you’ve got one out the way which is brilliant.'

Rosie agreed, saying: 'We planned it quite well.'

Chris added: 'I mean you can look at it like that, or you can look at it like, just as we’re about to get a bit of our life back, we’re plunging ourselves back into nappies, and midnight feeding hell.'  

Co-host Jamie Theakston asked the couple if lockdown has helped or hindered their relationship.

Rosie said: 'At the beginning it was really good and quite nice because Chris is away a lot so it was nice to have him home and Robin’s loved seeing his dad everyday which he never had, but now six months on, yeah, I’m ready for the world to go back to normal, Chris to get back to work, on his tour.'

Rosie said: 'We got a bit bored one day and thought why not, so little baby Ramsey number two is coming in January'

Chris added: 'She literally says to us every day, "when are you going to just go back to work?", like it’s up to me, like it’s my choice, like I’m furloughing myself for the craic.

'I can’t wait to go back on tour, I’ve got no one to show off to, I want to be on stage showing off.' 

In July, Chris and Rosie announced that they were expecting their second child in January 2021. 

Rosie announced the pregnancy with an Instagram post, writing the caption: '4pm wine time BABY' coming January 2021. . @iamchrisramsey xx'

Chris added: 'Just as we’re about to get a bit of our life back, we’re plunging ourselves back into nappies, and midnight feeding hell'

She then revealed hours later she has been 'an emotional wreck' since learning she was expecting their second child.

Rosie also candidly told fans she was 'very anxious' leading up the 12-week scan after suffering a miscarriage in 2018, but added the pregnancy is going well.

She said: 'It's absolutely killed us this is why I haven't been on Stories much. One, because I've been a hormonal mess.

'Two, I haven't been able to drink wine and I got a few questions and I was just like I can't be dealing with this, and three, I hate lying and it kills us so I haven't been on Stories much because you know when you have got a secret it's been weeks.'

Rosie added she first learned she was pregnant when she was just four or five weeks along, but waited until the 12-week scan to announce the news publicly.
