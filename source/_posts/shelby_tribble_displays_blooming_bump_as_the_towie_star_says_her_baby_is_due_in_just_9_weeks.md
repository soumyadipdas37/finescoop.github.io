She wore a knitted white crop top that exposed her midriff, and gazed warmly at the camera as she stood in her pink and cream-coloured bedroom.    

Shelby had been experiencing a rocky relationship with Sam, 28, on The Only Way is Essex and decided to leave the show to focus on their future.

Trying times: While her pregnancy may look picture perfect, Shelby has also said she she has struggled with some of the more challenging sides of her changing body

Shelby recently explained she is beginning to struggle with some of the more challenging sides of her changing body.

The media personality penned: 'Although I may look glam and have had the best pregnancy you can wish for.

'The heartburn, swollen ankles/feet, back ache, leg cramps and chafing are all staring to play their parts.' 

The reality star revealed to fans she hasn't experienced any morning sickness and feels she is just as 'clueless' as those asking her for pregnancy advice because she is a first-time mum.

Shelby wrote: 'You make my heart so happy. I've had a lot of mums asking me for advice but I'm going to be completely honest with you it's my first baby and I'm just as clueless. 

'I'm such a laid back person I just take each day as it comes to avoid adding too much stress on me and more importantly the baby ( don't get me wrong I have my odd days but it's not as often as I thought and I'm sure pregnancy hormones can play a part). 

'I've been lucky to have supportive family and friends around me to give me tips, tricks and advice. Also I've been so lucky because I've had a really good pregnancy with no sickness and felt really well in myself.'
