Yorkshire were forced to withdraw captain David Willey and three other players from the Roses' defeat at Headingley due to coronavirus protocols.

With a member of the squad within their training bubble reporting symptoms, the club ruled out Willey. 

Vice-captain Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Matthew Fisher and Josh Poysden were also pulled out in accordance with their Covid-19 guidelines.

The Roses captain could not contribute as Yorkshire lost to Lancashire, a blow to their hopes

Yorkshire had hoped to include them but were unable to as the results of a Covid test on the player in question were not received ahead of the 6.15pm start to a match that all-but ended their chances of qualifying for the quarter-finals of the Vitality Blast.

Adam Lyth was stand-in skipper for the Roses, while Dawid Malan - who faced Australia and Pakistan in England's recent T-20s - also returned to the side. 

Lancashire strengthened their hold on second place in the northern group and are well placed to seal a last-eight spot following a comfortable chase of 146 against their under-par hosts.
