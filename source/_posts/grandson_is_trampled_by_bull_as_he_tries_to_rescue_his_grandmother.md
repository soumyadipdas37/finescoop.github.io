This is the moment that a grandson is trampled by an angry bull as he tries to rescue his elderly gran, who has been knocked to the ground by the animal. 

The 70-year-old woman was savagely attacked by a bull when she was walking down an alleyway just before 6am on September 27 in northern India's Haryana state.

The elderly woman tries to walk past the raging bull when it runs directly at her and hits her with its horns, knocking her cleanly off her feet, CCTV footage shows.

A brave grandson was trampled after trying to save his 70-year-old gran, who had been headbutted by the animal, CCTV footage from just before 6am on September 27 shows

In the video, the threatening bull towers over the elderly woman after forcefully knocking her onto her back.

Her grandson, who witnessed the attack, fearlessly runs down the alleyway to try and save his gran from any further injury.

But he is trampled by the powerful animal, which kicks and headbutts him as he struggles to crawl away from the animal's strikes.

He manages to scramble underneath the angry bovine and lift his gran off the floor, leading her backwards away from the animal.

The woman's grandson was trampled by the bull and then they were both thrown through the air by the bull (above) when they tried to flee the scene 

As they try to escape the scene, the bull charges at them again and forcefully throws them both backwards through the air.

Other residents begin rushing out of their homes to assist the elderly woman and her grandson, with one man appearing brandishing a long stick.

The man appears to hit the ground next to the bull to scare it before he runs backwards away from the animal, as other residents quickly gather at the scene.

The elderly woman suffered a fracture in one of her hands as a result from the attack.

Her brave grandson is reportedly undergoing treatment following the incident.
