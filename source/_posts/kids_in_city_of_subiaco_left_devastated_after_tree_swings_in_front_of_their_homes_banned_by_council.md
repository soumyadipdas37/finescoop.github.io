A council has banned children from playing on tree swings, prompting one seven-year-old girl to write a heartfelt letter begging them to reconsider.

Three families in Subiaco, in Perth's western suburbs, had swings set up for their children outside their homes.

But the council ordered the families take them down or relocate them within the next 14 days.

Odette, 7, wrote a letter (pictured) to the council begging them to not take down the swing as it allowed the kids to have fun, no one had been hurt, it created community and it wasn't an eyesore

One of the affected children, Odette, wrote a letter to the council asking them to allow the swing as it allowed the kids to have fun, no one had been hurt, it created community and it wasn't an eyesore. 

The Sprogoe, Devitt and Prince families were all given removal notices , Western Suburbs Weekly reported.

All the families complied expect the Sprogoes, who said they were too busy at work to remove the swing. 

Andrew Devitt said even though he complied his two sons weren't happy about it. 

'It [the tree swing] cost me probably $40 or $50 bucks so I'd rather that than have the council hack it out of the tree, so we decided to pull it down,' he said.

Acting chief executive of the council Cliff Frewing said there had been discretion when it came to these matters due to COVID-19.  

'During COVID-19, while City playgrounds were closed, some discretion was provided to families and removal notices were not issued for play equipment on verges,' Mr Frewing said.

'These were unusual circumstances, and now that restrictions have eased, the City is monitoring verges again to minimise risk of harm to the community and liability for 

The only council in WA that allows for play equipment on the verge is the City of Vincent. 

Mayor Penny Taylor told Daily Mail Australia: 'The City of Subiaco has committed to review the local laws and policies for play equipment on verges so that common sense can come back into play.'
