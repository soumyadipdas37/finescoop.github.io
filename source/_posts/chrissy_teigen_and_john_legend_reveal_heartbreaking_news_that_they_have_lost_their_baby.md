Chrissy Teigen has suffered a miscarriage.

The 34-year-old model took to her Instagram to share four heartbreaking photos that included herself, husband John Legend, 41, and their unborn son 'Jack.'

Teigen also penned a lengthy caption explaining the tragedy and expressed her family's grief over the sudden loss.

She wrote: 'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before. We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn’t enough.'

Teigen was hospitalized on Sunday night after enduring a month of bleeding due to having a weak placenta and has remained at the hospital since.

She continued: 'We never decide on our babies’ names until the last possible moment after they’re born, just before we leave the hospital. But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack.

'So he will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever.' 

Chrissy and John revealed in the music video for John's new single Wild that they were expecting their third child together, a son.
