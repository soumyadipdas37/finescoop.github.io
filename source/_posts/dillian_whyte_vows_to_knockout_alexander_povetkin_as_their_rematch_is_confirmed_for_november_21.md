Dillian Whyte has vowed to 'even the score' by knocking out Alexander Povetkin in their rematch, which has now been confirmed for November 21. 

The Brit was knocked out cold by Povetkin in a shock defeat last month and subsequently surrendered his place as the No 1 mandatory challenger to Tyson Fury's WBC world title.

But the Brixton heavyweight has been given an immediate shot at redemption - which will come just 91 days after his brutal knockout defeat against the Russian.



Speaking after the fight was announced, Whyte said: 'I'm over the moon to have the rematch. As soon as I got out of the ring, I was looking for confirmation that the fight would be on. I can't wait to get back in the ring and get back what is rightfully mine.

'I'm looking to do what I said I would the first time and that's beat Alexander Povetkin. 

'There won't be any major adjustments, but I just need to be more switched on and not get distracted. He was able to use his experience against me. 

'I will be a lot more focused and sharper in the rematch. I'm coming to win and knock him out. I'm coming to even the score and the only way to do that is by knocking him out.'

Povetkin, who had been floored twice by Whyte before his perfectly-timed uppercut ended their first fight, added: 'I've rested well, spent time with my family, and now that the date of the rematch is known, I will soon return to my training camp and prepare as thoroughly as I did for the first fight. 

'As I said before the first fight and after it too, Dillian Whyte is a good, strong boxer. I will be ready to enter the ring on November 21. I hope it will be another beautiful fight for the fans.'

This will be a make-or-break fight for Whyte, who will be well aware that a victory is needed to keep alive his world title ambitions.
