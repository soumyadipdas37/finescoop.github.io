A top women's rugby player awarded the MBE for her services to the sport made hoax 999 calls and waved a knife at police, a court heard.

Non Evans, 46, broke records when she became the first woman to compete in three sports at the Commonwealth Games.

But she spiralled into 'attention seeking' behaviour after leaving sports left 'a huge hole' in her life.

Swansea Magistrates' Court heard Evans (pictured with her MBE) brandished the knife at officers and grabbed their body-worn cameras to offer cash to 'keep quiet

A court heard Evans made 'rambling calls' to the Welsh Ambulance Service reporting somebody unable to breathe.

She also launched a tirade of abuse at a neighbour before waving a kitchen knife in the road.

Police were called to her house in Swansea, South Wales, on August 25.

Swansea Magistrates' Court heard Evans brandished the knife at officers and grabbed their body-worn cameras to offer cash to 'keep quiet.'

She told officers she was 'attention seeking' and admitted to drinking half a bottle of vodka.

Defending Stuart John said she was 'lost' and was struggling to come to terms with retirement from international sports.

He said it had left 'a huge hole' in her life causing her depression, anxiety and alcohol misuse.  

Her problems were also made worse in lockdown because she has been unable to attend face-to-face counselling sessions, the court was told.

Evans was given a nine week sentence, suspended for 12 months.

In a highly emotional series of Tweets, Evans revealed in  July that she is gay.

'I have always wanted to tell the world that I'm gay. But I didn't want to upset my parents x'.
