Leicester are considering a move for Bayer Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah if they cannot agree a deal for Burnley’s James Tarkowski.

As Sportsmail reported in August, the Clarets are still demanding £50million for the centre-back, with Leicester offering an in excess of £30m on Friday, which was subsequently turned down.

Tarkowski is interested in joining Leicester, who attempted to sign him last summer, but the deal rests over whether Burnley can be persuaded to lower their valuation of the 27-year-old, who has less than two years left on his contract and turns 28 in November.

West Ham failed with a series of bids for Tarkowski while Leicester have been similarly frustrated in their move for St Etienne defender Wesley Fofana. Former Foxes boss Claude Puel is now in charge of the Ligue 1 side and is reluctant to let Fofana, 19, go despite offers around the £30m mark from Leicester and the Hammers.

Tah is a Germany international who developed into a key man for Leverkusen since moving from Hamburg five years ago. Tah, 24, is well known by Leicester head of recruitment Lee Congerton, who worked at Hamburg from 2011-14.

Meanwhile, Rodgers revealed he is chasing three more signings before the window closes on October 5 after detailing his plans to the board over the summer.

Leicester have already completed the signing of Timothy Castagne from Atalanta for £22million and Cengiz Under, the winger on a season-long loan from Roma, is expected to begin training with his new colleagues next week.

But Rodgers is desperate to add a centre-half and another forward, while winger Demarai Gray is among the players who will be allowed to leave if a suitable offer arrives.  

Rodgers said: ‘We said before the season that we may need up to five players. If we could bring in five I felt that would strengthen the squad and really help us to keep progressing.

‘It’s never easy. We’ve been able to bring in a couple and we see the impact that Timothy Castagne has made and Cengiz Under will help us for sure.

‘There are other areas we want to improve on. But if we can’t do that, then we’ll still be excited by the players we have as there’s a lot of growth there.’
