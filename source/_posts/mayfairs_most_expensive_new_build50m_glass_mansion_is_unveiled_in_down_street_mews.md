A gleaming glass palace on Mayfair's Down Street Mews has gone on sale for a cool £50million - and has instantly become the exclusive London district's most expensive new build home.

Inspired by La Maison de Verre in Paris, the Glass Mansion is actually two homes which are on sale for £25million a-piece, but can be combined to create a palatial home for £50million. 

The Glass Mansion as a whole provides 13,583 square feet of luxurious living space, a cinema, private spa with swimming pool, a 1,251 square-foot roof garden, a 226 square-foot garden patio and a spacious four-car garage. 

The stunning mansion is situated behind a private gated courtyard in Mayfair's Down Street Mews and is located on a half-acre acre site that used to house former Italian Count Dino Grandi's 'lost' mansion, of which only the black-brick Edwardian stables survive. Grandi was Italy's UK ambassador under Mussolini.

Down Street Mews was originally occupied by a black brick Edwardian mansion and stables, built in 1920, accessed by a gated carriage driveway off Down Street. 

In August 1932 the mansion became the London home of Count Dino Grandi, Benito Mussolini's Ambassador to the UK. 

At his mansion Count Grandi entertained Lady Alexandra Curzon, his mistress and the wife of 'Fruity' Metcalfe, equerry to Edward, Prince of Wales, and other Italophile guests including Diana Mitford, 'Fruity' Metcalfe, Lord Lloyd, Lloyd George and Wallis Simpson. 

The other main guest bedrooms have luxurious marble clad ensuite bathrooms,featuring walk in showers 

The main bathroom features a marble clad walk-in shower lined with mirrored walls 

In July 1939 Count Grandi was recalled to Rome by Mussolini who was under pressure from Adolf Hitler, enraged by Grandi's attempts to deliver peace between Italy and Britain. 

In 1940 a Luftwaffe bomb destroyed Grandi's Down Street Mews mansion, with only the stables by the entrance courtyard surviving; in 1943 Grandi got his revenge, triggering the coup which overthrew Mussolini and started peace negotiations with the Allies.

After 1945 Grandi's mansion site off Down Street Mews was divided with the front portion, including the courtyard and surviving stables, transformed into commercial premises, with the remainder to the rear turned into post-war housing.

Five years ago a Mayfair developer acquired the commercial premises fronting onto the mews courtyard with a vision of returning the site to it's residential origins. 

The marble clad main bathroom features modern decor, his and hers sinks and built in spotlights 

The incredible living space also features a Hemlock sauna with Obeche benching and a sauna with ‘Starry Sky’ fibre optics in the ceiling

After planning and a three year construction programme the new glass houses at Down Street Mews are finished and ready for immediate occupation.  

Gary Hersham, Founding Director of Beauchamp Estates said: 'The houses have been designed so that they can be easily configured into a single 13,583 sqft mansion interconnected on all floors providing eight bedrooms, four reception rooms and two levels of leisure facilities. 

'In the £20 million plus ultra-prime marketplace we have found that COVID-19 has been a 'gamechanger' with buyers now choosing houses, where they can completely control access and their living environment, in preference to apartment buildings where there are the issues of shared access, visitors they don't know and staff meeting lots of people.'

Both houses have an entire floor dedicated to a luxurious private spa featuring marble decor and as sauna room
