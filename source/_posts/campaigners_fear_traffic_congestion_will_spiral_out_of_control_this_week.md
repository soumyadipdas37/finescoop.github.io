Campaigners fear congestion on roads across the country next week could spiral out of control as parents struggle against road works to get their children to school.Motoring organisations warn road closures and new cycles lanes being built across the UK could create 'perfect storm' as pupils head back to the classroom for the first time.Parents are expected to shun public transport over coronavirus fears and will take to the roads instead by giving their children lifts to schools and there are now concerns it will cause a traffic gridlock, the Daily Telegraph reports.The start of the Autumn term comes as many people are also preparing to head back to the office for the first time. Both the AA and RAC have said new road layouts created as part of the Department of Transport's £250 million scheme to promote a 'new era for cycling and walking' could cause motoring mayhem over the next few weeks.Their concerns come as vigilantes in a number of boroughs have vandalised so-called modal filters, which include planters and bollards fitted to close off roads.Plans launched by Grant Shapps (pictured) in May are aimed at boosting greener methods of transport across the country but the AA and RAC claim that roadworks could cause traffic flow to grind to a haltThe beginning of the new school year comes alongside the drive for workers to return to the office and motoring organisations claim the situation is a perfect storm as works continue to be carried out by local councils. Pictured Traffic builds because of a new one-way system being installed in Bradford-upon-Avon on August 26AA's head of roads policy Jack Cousens has warned that congestion could reach its peak upon the return of the school run.He told the Telegraph 'There has been an ongoing backlash from residents, businesses, taxis and traders, but while councils have introduced restrictions with the best of intentions, the lack of consultation has been very poor.'We understand why councils wanted to increase space coming out of lockdown to allow social distancing, but now we appear to have reached the point where that is becoming impractical as schools and workers try to return to normality.'According to the AA's website, there are 1,193 roadworks currently being undertaken in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. According to the AA's website there are 1,193 roadworks currently being undertaken in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Pictured Roadworks on London Bridge on May 18RAC's own head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes has said that ironically, the measures put in place by councils to reduce traffic disruption could cause a greater level of congestion.He said 'Councils should be monitoring schemes closely and should be prepared to make change if gridlock ensues.'A recent AA survey found that as many as one fifth of parents won't allow their children on public transport because of coronavirus and this could see an increase in traffic of up to 10 per cent. A Government spokesperson also confirmed that £40million has been given to local councils to expand capacity outside of public transport.The plans launched by Grant Shapps in May are aimed at boosting greener methods of transport across the country.Pop-up bike lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, and cycle and bus-only corridors are part of the £250 million scheme.Concerns about congestion as children return to school comes as furious Britons blast Sadiq Khan's war on motorists which has left roads across the capital jammed with bumper-to-bumper traffic.Cars are not allowed on roads around popular parks including St James's Park, Green Park and Hyde Park in a trial to create 'car-free' spaces which will last six months.The London mayor has faced harsh criticism for cutting off parts of the capital and widening pavements to create more space for cyclists and pedestrians in the wake of Covid-19 lockdown. The aim is to encourage more people to walk or cycle to work, but many motorists and bus users fear London could now grind to a halt as the return to work continues. Angry residents in Crystal Palace, South London, protest against road closures earlier this monthRoads around the capital have become jammed with hotspots found in South London around the Tooting and Balham areas where 'low traffic neighbourhoods' have been implementedRoads around the capital have become jammed with particular hotspots found in South London around the Tooting, Stockwell, Balham and Clapham areas. Motorists have slammed Mr Khan for 'sabotaging' London's roads with the overhaul, with others sharing images of traffic jams and claiming their commutes have been more than doubled by the move.Mr Khan has long pushed his green credentials but has faced criticism over his perceived failure to persuade people to return to their places of work. The congestion charge was temporarily increased on June 22 to £15 and operated 7am to 10pm seven days a week - up from £11.50 for 7am to 6pm on weekdays only.But some have pointed out that cars stuck in traffic jams following the changes to road layouts and lane closures will worsen pollution in parts of the capital.  Opposition is also growing in Brighton, Essex and Cheshire where one-way systems, widened pavements and road closures have been imposed to ease social distancing.Residents and traders are growing increasingly frustrated with the controversial measures, which they claim are causing long tailbacks and decimating footfall.A member of the public speaks with volunteer Andrew Nicolson who is in favour of the new one-way system which has been deployed in Bradford-on-Avon, WiltshireMotorists in Bradford-on-Avon say a £30,000 one-way system has created a traffic 'nightmare'Critics say the measures have little impact on Covid-19 transmission and are being used by councils to drive through 'anti-car' policies and extend cycle lanes. Earlier this month it was also reported that there was also growing unrest over the changes to street landscapes in areas such as Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Crystal Palace in South London.Islington Council intends to turn a third of its roads into 'people friendly streets' by the end of 2020 using bollards, no entry signs and cameras to close 'rat-runs'.Responding to claims the road closures were 'anti working class', Islington Council leader Richard Watts tweeted 'Car ownership in inner-London is linked to income.'The richer you are, the more likely you are to own a car. Truth is we're stopping affluent people polluting working class communities.'The protests on Upper Street are being coordinated by an outside group and many of the attendees aren't Islington residents.'I welcome that in shutting off the street to traffic they're showing how nice traffic free streets can be.'Elsewhere, more than 1,500 people signed a petition urging Cambridgeshire County Council to scrap an Experimental Traffic Orders road closure in Mills Road.And campaigners in Oxford are also at loggerheads with the county and city councils over proposed temporary 'bus gates' in the centre of the city.Councillors plan to install two bus gates in central Oxford in September which will operate from 7.30am to 6.30pm seven days a week.Roadworks on London Bridge are pictured on May 18 as the lockdown began to be easedTraffic builds in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, today as a new one-way system is put into placeTraffic builds in Bradford-on-Avon today as a new one-way system is put into place thereIn Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, drivers say a £30,000 one-way system has created a traffic 'nightmare' and it now takes 40 minutes to get through the town.The new system has reduced the town's narrow medieval bridge to one lane, with traffic lights at each end, and was put in place to widen pavements.There have been hundreds of complaints on social media.Marcus Holbrow wrote on Facebook 'Traffic lights on the bridge will have a huge impact on travel time through the town. Absolutely crazy scheme, and should be scrapped as soon as possible.'Christine Atkinson said 'I went there yesterday and it was a nightmare. Terrible idea.'And Mark Smith added 'This is the most moronic idea I have ever seen or heard. How does this improve social distancing?'I would understand if it was a one way for pedestrians. My commute to work is already 45 minutes, cannot afford to add another half hour on it.'Bradford-on-Avon mayor Simon McNeill-Ritchie said 'It's a Covid-19 response project to enable pedestrians over the bridge to maintain social distancing.John O'Connor tweeted a picture of a traffic jam in South London, saying 'My now two-hour drive every day which usually takes about 50 minutes to an hour home from work'One driver tried to move a low traffic neighbourhood box blocking a route in South LondonOne Twitter user said the new post-Covid traffic scheme in Balham and Tooting will 'cause pollution, massive queues and possibly cycling deaths'This Twitter user posted footage of queuing in London, saying the roads had been 'sabotaged''It's only there to provide extra space for pedestrians. There are some people who are protesting against it and I understand why, if you are a motorists you for the first time have to stop at a set of traffic lights in the town.'The only reason it's there is to protect pedestrians from pedestrians.'The streets are very narrow and we can only do what the Government are advising us to do by having people step into the road.'Hence why the lanes have been restricted in a few very small areas. It's an unavoidable inconvenience.' Due to reduced car use during lockdown in Brighton, new cycle lane schemes were introduced which affected traffic as normal life started to resume. On August 21, around 50 people descended on the Brighton and Hove City Council building to voice their opposition to the changes across the city.Chris O'Connor, 35, said 'Reverse this decision and start earning the people's trust again.'At the end of the day, we are the ones who vote you in and we are the ones who will vote you out.'We are here to say no more, stop what you're doing, we don't accept four new cycle lanes.'In Colchester, Essex, hundreds of local residents have signed a petition calling for a review of changes to the roads due to the coronavirus.A busy road in the area has been reduced to one lane, and frustrated motorists want the other lane reopened.The petition, set up by Richard Pearce, also calls for other Covid measures to be reviewed.It says 'The residents of Colchester are angry and frustrated at the state of our roads in our town.'During the lockdown Essex Highways decided to close one lane on the North Station roundabout on the A134 Southbound for 'social distancing'.This cycle route in Tooting, South London, has been created to travel right under a bus stopKien Tan tweeted that bus lanes were 'being transformed into cycle lanes for the torrent of completely invisible cyclists'Traffic issues are intensifying in South London, with jams pictured in Tooting aboveEmergency vehicles have been struggling to get through the traffic in Tooting, South London'With the lockdown now over and businesses on their knees Essex Highways has decided to make this change semi-permanent despite hundreds of complaints..'This is one of the busiest roundabouts in Colchester, the lane closure is causing a huge increase in congestion and pollution.'Essex Highways boss Kevin Bentley said as a resident and borough councillor he understood the impact of the measures.'It is important to remember that these measures are designed to support residents with social distancing, which is as important as ever in our efforts to prevent further spread of Covid-19.'In Harleston, Norfolk, road closures put in place to help social distancing have been branded a 'nightmare', and described as not fit for purpose.Residents argue that while the initially may have helped enforce social distancing, the road closures are now having an effect on trade in the area.Charles Murray, who lives in nearby Botesdale, said he would now be taking his custom elsewhere after a recent visit led to a wrong turn down a one-way street.The 71-year-old said 'It is probably better for people who are from Harleston and know what's going on, but for me it was an absolute nightmare.'Personally I cannot see the point of closing the roads - it is making things more confusing. We won't go back until things are back how they were.' Simon Marjoram, a local business owner, said 'Everything about it is terrible.'To get from one end to another, you have to take a three-mile detour on the bypass. But instead of doing that, people are going through the Co-op car park.'There are signs telling people to take a diversion, when there is no diversion. Where we live we are having to rescue visitors whose sat navs are confused.'We are reliant on people from surrounding villages coming in. Instead people are saying 'we cannot be bothered, we'll go somewhere else'.'Despite this, South Norfolk Council maintains the changes, introduced in June 'with the public's health in mind', are designed to boost confidence among customers.A spokesman said 'The restriction of traffic in The Thoroughfare remains in place to facilitate safe social distancing.'We acknowledge some of these changes have caused disruption, but they have been implemented with the public's health in mind to help social distancing.'This increases the confidence of people to return to the high street.'In Chester, roads were closed so that experimental bus and cycle lanes could be installed, which means narrowing traffic lanes for cars.The scheme, payed for by a £161,000 Department for Transport grant, is being implemented to help the area emerge from the coronavirus crisis.A £250 million emergency active travel fund was launched in May as part of Transport Secretary Grant Shappss 'new era' for cycling and walking.The cash, revealed at a coronavirus briefing on May 9, was billed by the Government as the 'largest ever boost for cyclists and pedestrians'.Ministers said it would bring in emergency bike lanes and streets, while trials of rental e-scooters would be brought forward to increase green transport options.The money has also gone towards pop-up bike lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, safer junctions and cycle and bus-only corridors.The plans aim to encourage more people to choose alternatives to public transport when they need to travel, to help people observe social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.Future proposals include Greater Manchester creating 150 miles of protected cycle track, while Transport for London is planning a 'bike Tube' network above Underground lines.The fund is the first stage of a £2billion Government investment, as part of a £5billion fund for cycling and buses announced in February.
