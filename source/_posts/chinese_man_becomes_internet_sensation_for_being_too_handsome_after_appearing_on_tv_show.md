Chinese etizens appear to be more stunned by Mr Zhang’s handsome face as the footage has racked up over 50 million views on Chinese Twitter-like Weibo within just 24 hours

The 22-year-old was interviewed by Zhejiang Television when he made his cameo appearance on the regional TV station's consumer rights programme.

Mr Zhang claimed that the sliding glass door in his rented furnished flat had suddenly shattered itself when he was taking a shower on September 8.

The broken glass left him injured with severe cuts on both of his hands. The tenant also spent over 9,400 yuan (£1,084.87) on his medical bills.

Mr Zhang was hoping to seek compensation from the residential management office with the help of the local press.

One commenter wrote: ‘Once I saw Mr Zhang’s face, I couldn’t care any less about the news story.’

Another said: ‘I think it’s definitely the apartment and the management office’s fault, no objection. Mr Zhang is too handsome. I don’t think he’ll lie.’

A third user commented: ‘Mr Zhang, do you need a girlfriend?’

The Chinese man, who works as a live-streamer for an online retail brand, said he was overwhelmed by the national attention the video attracted.

He told reporters: ‘I think it’s too much. I just wanted to protect my rights. I didn’t think this would happen.’

The residential management office initially denied their responsibility for the broken door as there was no evidence to prove it had shattered itself, said a spokesperson.

They eventually agreed to pay for part of Mr Zhang’s medical bills after the video became viral, according to the tenant.
