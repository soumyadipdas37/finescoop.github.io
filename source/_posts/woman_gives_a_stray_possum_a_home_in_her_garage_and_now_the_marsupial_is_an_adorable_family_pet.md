A destructive possum was adopted by a Victorian family after they bought an $8 Kmart item to stop the marsupial from wrecking their garage. 

Leisa Embury Collins, from Belgrave, east of Melbourne, said the possum, named Pandy, had been climbing into the garage and pushing over paint cans since May. 

She said the animal looked extremely sad when he sat on the shelves so her mother told her to find him a box to live in before the family bought a cat cave from Kmart for $8. 

'We decided to go one better and buy him the Kmart cat cave,' she told news.com.au.

'We never really thought he’d use it but three-and-a-half hours later he was in it.'

While Pandy was somewhat of a pet to the family Mrs Collins said he was still a wild animal that came and went as he pleased. 

She created a Facebook page, Pandycam 2020, so other people could enjoy the possum's garage adventures.

Some users pointed out how much happier he looked in the cat bed compared to when he was on the cold garage shelf. 

'Naw that first pic, Pandy is so lucky to have found you,' one user wrote.

'You are a wonderful human being. Seeing Pandy so comfy warms my heart,' another added. 

'He is almost smiling,' a third Facebook user pointed out.
