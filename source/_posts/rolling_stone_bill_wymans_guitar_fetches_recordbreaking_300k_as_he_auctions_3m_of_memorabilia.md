A bass guitar once belonging to former Rolling Stones star Bill Wyman sold at auction for a record-breaking $384,000 (about £300,000) over the weekend.

More than 1,000 items from the rocker's archive went under the hammer, including musical instruments, amplifiers, stage-worn ensembles, awards and personal items.

The collection contained pieces from Wyman's three-decade stint in the Stones as well as from his solo career, and was sold at a Julien's Auctions event in Beverly Hills.

The 1969 Fender Mustang Bass, with a competition orange finish, was used by Wyman for Rolling Stones concerts and recordings in 1969 and 1970.

It is the most expensive bass guitar ever sold at auction, auctioneers said, a record that was previously held by a left-handed Hofner presented to Paul McCartney in 1964, which sold for $204,800 in 2013.

Another item once belonging to Wyman, 83, fetched a world record price. His 1962 VOX AC30 Normal model amplifier went for $106,250 (about £82,700).

The amplifier was used extensively by the Rolling Stones and is said to have played a key part in Wyman joining the band following his audition.

The price beat the combined sale of two amplifiers owned by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, which sold at auction in 2019 for $77,000.

Auctioneers said a third 'unexpected' record may have been set at the sale, which was originally set to take place in May but delayed amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

A yellow plush toilet seat cover printed with the Rolling Stones' famous tongue logo sold for $1,152 (about £897), making it possibly the most expensive toilet seat lid cover sold at auction.

Delayed: The auction was originally scheduled to take place in May, but was delayed amid the COVID-19 pandemic

Big haul: Other items sold at the auction included his Ted Newman Jones Short-Scale bass (about £24,300), an early 1960s Framus Star Bass model 5/150 (about £39,850)

Other items belonging to Wyman and sold at the auction included his Ted Newman Jones Short-Scale bass (about £24,300), an early 1960s Framus Star Bass model 5/150 (about £39,850) and his Mellotron MKII model keyboard (about £63,200).

The top-selling item was a 1968 Gibson Les Paul Standard Model Gold Top guitar and case used by Stones founder Brian Jones in the band's Rock And Roll Circus concert in 1968.

It sold for $704,000 (about £547,945) - more than three times its pre-auction estimate.

The collection of 1,000 items also  included amps, awards and outfits the band wore on stage throughout his 50-year career playing bass for the rock 'n roll legends.

Wyman, 83, who played with the band from 1962 to 1993, said he will donate some of the proceeds to a group of his favourite charities.

There were a number of personal artefacts in the collection that document some of the Stones' earliest days as a group.

Included was an early BBC radio contract dated July 15, 1964 for an appearance The Rhythm and Blues Show, recorded on October 8, 1964.

The show aired on October 31 that year and the contract was predicted to fetch £2,000.

Record: A 'silver' record presented by DISC magazine to the Rolling Stones while Wyman played bass for the legendary band

Other items from the early years of the group included an early press release from April 1964 worth £2,000.

Speaking about the sale, Wyman said: 'Collecting and archiving has been one of the great pleasures of my life and will undoubtedly be one of my legacies.

'It feels like the right time to share my archive with the world and I hope people will get as much joy from my collections as I have.

'It is easier to let these items go knowing that a portion of the proceeds from this sale will support three causes that are close to my heart.'

A portion of the proceeds from the auction will benefit the Prince's Trust, Macmillan Cancer Support and CCMI (Central Caribbean Marine Institute).
