Recently, Hale admitted she's mourning the cancellation of her latest series Katy Keene, which was revealed to be cut after one season by The CW in July.

As the leading lady reflected on the Riverdale spin-off, she described the series as the 'highlight' of her career and how much she enjoyed living in New York City.

'It is always sad when things come to an end prematurely but in my opinion, I wanted that show to go on for many years and seasons,' the 31-year-old actress told E! News.

She added: 'It was such a horrible day when we found out about it not coming back, but seeing the response from everyone being upset and the response of everyone else who supports me was only to show how much the show was loved.'

The news came as a surprise to the star, who says she knows exactly what her character would be doing in season two.

'It's always a bummer to see that come to a halt without you wanting it to but, ultimately, I only had amazing things to say about that show and the people and everyone involved in it,' she concluded.
