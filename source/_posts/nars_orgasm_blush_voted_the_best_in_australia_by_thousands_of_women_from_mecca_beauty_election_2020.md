A $48 blush loved by the likes of Meghan Markle and Jennifer Lawrence has been voted the best in Australia by thousands of beauty fans.

Nars Orgasm Blush has earned a cult status for delivering a 'natural-looking rosy flush' that flatters every skin tone.

And now the iconic peachy-pink shimmer hue has been crowned the winner after taking out the 'Best Blush' category in the coveted Mecca Beauty Election 2020.

'This is a one stop blush for everyone, spun with a beautiful golden shimmer it gives your complexion a glimmering finish,' Nars lead makeup artist Niko Lopez said.

The buildable formula features micronised powder to ensure it blends seamlessly and wears all day. 

The pressed powder has gained a legion of fans, with hundreds swearing by the blush for offering a natural-looking pink pop colour to the cheeks.

'Orgasm is my number one go-to blush... It looks deceptively pink in the palette but as soon as you put it on, wow! It's so gorgeous and almost changes colour on the face. Will keep purchasing NARS blushes forever,' one reviewer wrote.

Another added: 'Orgasm is the best colour. Love it! Best blush I've ever had. It looks natural and blends out easily.'

Despite its expensive price tag, many said the powder lasts a long time because you only need 'a tiny bit' for your face.

'I love the formula and just a little bit of product goes a long way. In love with the Orgasm shade since you can make a look either natural or bold,' one woman said.

Another said: 'This is a staple in my makeup bag. It looks so natural on and provides just the right amount of luminosity. A little goes a long way, and almost every day use for me can still last nine months or so before I need to repurchase.'

A third said: 'Love this product in Orgasm. Have been using it for years and always retain it as the price is awesome for you get.' 

During an interview with InStyle magazine, Meghan Markle said: 'I love NARS blush in Orgasm - I use it on and off camera because it gives you a nice glow from within.'
