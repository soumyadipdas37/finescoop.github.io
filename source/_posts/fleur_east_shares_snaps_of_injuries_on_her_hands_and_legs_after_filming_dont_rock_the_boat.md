Fleur East revealed she was battered and bruised after arriving home from filming new ITV series Don't Rock The Boat. 

The former X Factor singer, 32, has been rowing for the last month and admitted she was in pain as she shared snaps of her sores and injuries via Instagram on Monday.

Fleur made the show with eleven other celebrities including Jodie Kidd, Jack Fincham, Craig Charles, Kimberley Wyatt, AJ Odudu, Freddie Flintoff, and Adam Thomas, and she posed for a succession of photos to update her fans. 

'My body is battered and bruised:' Fleur East shared snaps of injuries on her hands and legs via Instagram on Monday after filming gruelling show Don't Rock The Boat

Showing off bruises on her legs and arms, she wrote: 'I'm back from my adventures at sea and my body is battered and bruised but my soul is still intact (just about) lol - I can't believe I have rowed the entire length of Britain!! 

'I've never cried and laughed so much in equal measure. It's by far the toughest thing I've ever done and couldn't have done it without the amazing people I shared this journey with. I cannot wait for you all to see what we've been through!' 

Fleur's thighs were both badly bruised during the trip while the back of her ankles and the palms of her hands were skinned.

She wasn't the only one who admitted the experience has been exhausting as Adam Thomas and Jodie Kidd also showed off sore and blistered hands during the trip. 

Freddie Flintoff admitted the experience had disrupted his usual peloton fitness regime while Kimberly Wyatt was thrilled to be back with her wee ones but admitted it was one 'hell of a ride' adding: 'The seas can fix, inspire, and scare.' 

Former Emmerdale star Adam Thomas posted up an emotional reunion video with his excited children before revealing that he is due to head off again later this month to take part in the Amsterdam Monaco Atlantic Road Trip. 

Don't Rock The Boat sees two groups of celebrities race from Land’s End to John O’Groats with the show hosted by Freddie and AJ Odudu.

Worth the pain: Fleur claimed she 'never cried and laughed so much in equal measure' while filming the show, and seemed in good spirits despite the injuries

Last month, Fleur discussed with MailOnline why lockdown put everything into 'perspective' for her following the loss of her father earlier this year. 

With the lockdown restrictions beginning to ease, the singer reflected on the several months she spent at home with her husband and loved ones, adding that the loss of her beloved dad Malcom at the start of lockdown, coupled with the pandemic has made her see things differently.

She explained: 'I appreciate things more. One, because of the pandemic but also for me on a personal level as I lost my dad just before lockdown.'

Fleur, whose mother Irene lived with her and husband Marcel Badiane-Robin at the start of lockdown, continued: 'It was like, at the moment that I could have my family around me, it meant so much more to me for that reason.

Great team: Fleur added, 'It's by far the toughest thing I've ever done and couldn't have done it without the amazing people I shared this journey with'

'Thinking of all the things we usually moan about and then having everything put into perspective for me, right at the start of lockdown, definitely gave it a different meaning for me and placed a lot more importance on cherishing your loved ones.'

'It's interesting because before I was like, "I'll take it as it comes, I'm not in a rush, we've got time"', she explained. 'But as soon as you lose someone, you're like 'Wow OK, you can't really plan for anything, nothing's promised.

'So it's changed my views on that definitely. I'm a bit more open to the idea of starting a family now.

'I'm still not planning it, but I'm not waiting and saying "I'll start in a year" or anything like that. We are just letting things happen naturally now!'
