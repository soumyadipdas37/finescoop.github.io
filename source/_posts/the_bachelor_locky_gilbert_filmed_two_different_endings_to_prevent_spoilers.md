The season finale of The Bachelor, starring Locky Gilbert, is just one day away.

And as fans prepare for the nerve-wracking last episode, gossip website The Wash is reporting that this year's season will be a little different from previous years.

The publication claims that Locky, 31, filmed two different 'winner's endings': one with Bella Varelis and the other with Irena Srbinovska. 

Twist ending: As fans prepare to watch The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert choose his winner, The Wash is reporting that this year's season finale will be a little different from previous years

Filming multiple endings is common for competitive reality shows, such as Seven's My Kitchen Rules, but has never been done on The Bachelor before.

The Wash reports that the method was used this season to prevent loose-lipped crew members from leaking spoilers to the press.

If true, it would have been an extremely awkward task for Locky, who would have had to tell one of the women he was in love with her on camera, only to break it to her afterwards he'd actually chosen someone else.  

Awkward: Locky reportedly filmed two different 'winner's endings': one with Bella Varelis and the other with Irena Srbinovska. The method was supposedly used this season to prevent loose-lipped crew members from leaking spoilers to the press

'Producers wanted to really change it up this year and confuse viewers and keep the suspense. It also made sure no one on set would leak the ending,' a source said. 

'So they filmed two endings, one where Bella wins and one where Irena wins, so most of the crew wouldn’t actually know who wins.' 

They added: 'Locky was also told to look confused and to have a bit of an emotional moment for the cameras like he couldn’t make up his mind. This was all planned.' 

Fake news? a Channel 10 spokesperson denied this was the case, however, saying: 'The claim that two endings were filmed is false and misleading. There was only one ending filmed'

However, a Channel 10 spokesperson denied this was the case.

'The claim that two endings of The Bachelor Australia were filmed is false and misleading. There was only one ending filmed,' they said. 

The method of filming two endings has been used on MKR and MasterChef for years, meaning that the winners only learn the outcome along with the rest of the country.  

Love story: It comes after Locky said on Monday that he was happily in love with his chosen contestant and 'can't wait to tell people how great she is'. Pictured with Irena Srbinovska

It comes after Locky told TV Week on Monday that he was happily in love with his chosen contestant and 'can't wait to tell people how great she is'. 

'Excited is an understatement,' Locky said of finally being able to reveal his girlfriend.

'I cannot wait. I am beyond excited to be able to finally say it out loud... who I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with.'

The Bachelor finale week begins Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 

Favourite: Irena (pictured) is the bookies' favourite to win Locky's heart, as of Wednesday
