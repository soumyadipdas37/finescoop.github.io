Her son Malik has just turned 10 months old. 

And on Tuesday, Gogglebox star Sarah Marie Fahd absolutely stunned as she showed off her trim post-baby body. 

The 31-year-old looked flawless as she slipped her figure into a white skintight minidress.

The brunette beauty wore a flock from Love Nookie, that featured a bustier-style top and a floral design. 

She teamed the look with pointed pumps and wore her long dark locks out and over her shoulders, in loose tousled curls. 

Her makeup was complete with dewy foundation, a nude lip and a dark eye.

'It's beginning to feel a bit like summer and I love it! Spring and Summer are my favourite seasons. What's yours?' Sarah Marie captioned the Instagram post.

It comes after Sarah Marie gushed over her son as he turned 10 months. 

She posted a sweet selfie of the pair together to mark the milestone and wrote on Instagram: 'I can't believe you are already 10 months old today. I love you more and more each day my little Malik.'

'Each day we wake up you do something new and it amazes me. You always keep me on my toes.'

Sarah Marie and Matty, who married in 2018 after four years of dating, welcomed their first child son named Malik, in November last year.

The adorable youngster appears alongside the couple in the latest season of Gogglebox Australia.

Earlier this month, Sarah Marie told TV Week that she won't let her son watch Married At First Sight when he's old enough.

'Oh, my sweet mercy - can you imagine? I think that's going to be one of the show's that's banned in this house when he gets old enough,' she said.

'We'll be like, "no, no, this is not how you want to live your life! This is not reality!"
