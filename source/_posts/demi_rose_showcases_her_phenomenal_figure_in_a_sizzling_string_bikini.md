Woah! Demi Rose has ensured she's kept her fans up to speed with her swimwear-clad antics during her getaway, as she shared further sizzling snaps on Thursday

Demi was putting on a show-stopping display in her latest snaps, as she reclined on a sun longer with her eye-popping cleavage on show.

She slicked her brunette locks into a high bun while opting for dazzling make-up with lashings of highlighter and fluttering eyelashes.  

Ensuring she was showing off every inch of her frame, in another shot she turned to the back and gazed coquettishly over her shoulder.  

Despite the prospect of two weeks behind closed doors upon her return to the UK - the result of tightening travel restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 - Demi still seems to be smiling.

Spain had been among of a number of 'air-bridge' countries considered to be safe for quarantine-free travel, promoting many stars to book getaways, but a spike in coronavirus cases across the country has prompted a change in policy.

Before her trip to Ibiza, the Birmingham native had been isolating in her London flat after the novel coronavirus pandemic scuppered her travel plans for March - much to her displeasure.

Taking to social media at the time, Demi lamented: 'All I have with me is crochet stuff and bikinis. I'm sick of wearing all the other stuff that I bought that is loungey.

'What is your bet that this will be over in June, July, August... What do you think, like never? Corona really f**ed us up, really majorly f**ked us up.

'I hope you're all staying safe and me... I am meditating, I'm trying to read a lot of books. Me and Teddy are really bored. I really want corona to f**k off, honestly.'

The bombshell was catapulted to fame when she became romantically linked to Kylie Jenner's ex, rapper Tyga.
