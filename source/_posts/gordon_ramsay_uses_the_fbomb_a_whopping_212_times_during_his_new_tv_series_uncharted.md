According to The Sun, within just 30 seconds of the opening scene which takes place in Tasmania, Gordon has already sworn four times. 

The profanity-laden show takes the chef on a journey across the globe as he immerses himself in different cultures and competes against local cooks.

The new series features seven 44 minute episodes, which equates to a swearword per minute for Gordon.

Even the man himself acknowledged that he was throwing out curse words like hot cakes. 

During a fishing trip in the United States on the show, he joked: 'I’m in the marshes in South Louisiana where we’re collecting crawfish traps and so far the haul is as bad as my language.'      

The father-of-five, told Perth Now earlier this year that his youngest child, Oscar, one, is following in his footsteps which includes the use of expletives.

Gordon has been spending lockdown with his family in Cornwall, but he has grand plans for the next five years. 

The Michelin-star chef has his sights set on opening 200 new restaurants in Asia to expand his empire across the world by 2025.

He began reopening the first of his 35 restaurants in July after the business struggled during the coronavirus pandemic.

But now the businessman has unveiled new plans to extend his range of restaurants in contrast to industry competitors, including opening a further 50 sites in the UK as he revealed his plans in financial reports filed to Companies House last week.
