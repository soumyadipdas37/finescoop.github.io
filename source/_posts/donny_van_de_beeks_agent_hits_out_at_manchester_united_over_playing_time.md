Donny van de Beek hasn't started a Premier League game since joining Manchester United from Ajax, which has infuriated his agent Sjaak Swart.

Speaking to VoetbalPrimeur, Swart said: 'A substitute, I don't like it at all. I couldn't do it myself, standing in with four minutes to play.' 

The Dutch midfielder joined United for £40million, and fans were excited to see him form a midfield partnership with Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba.

Boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is still trying to figure out how to shape his midfield players

However, he has only featured as a substitute during their first two games, playing 23 minutes against Crystal Palace and only coming on for the final moments against Brighton. 

His contributions have been helpful though, scoring against Palace and helping win the penalty that gave United the game against the Seagulls. 

'I have to say he did three more good things,' said Swart. 'The penalty, where the winning goal came from, it came from him.

'Normally they should've lost 7-1. Brighton hit the post and bar five times. They have a nice team, but that should not happen to Manchester United.' 

Van de Beek did start for United in their Carabao Cup win over Luton, and was substituted after 78 minutes. 

With a huge game coming up against Tottenham next, boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may stick to his tried and trusted trio of Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba and Fernandes for that encounter. 

Of the three, Pogba is the man most likely to be under threat from Van de Beek's arrival.
