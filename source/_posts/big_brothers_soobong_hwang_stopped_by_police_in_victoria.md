Big Brother star Soobong Hwang was stopped by police on Tuesday after accidentally crossing into the Victorian border.

The reality star was attempting to drive from Adelaide to Canberra to visit his three children when he crossed the border without realising it.

In a video shared to Instagram after the incident, the 48-year-old said: 'I messed up.'

He continued: 'I went straight into Victorian border. And I said, "Oh no, I'm not supposed to be here!"' And I turn around. Caught by police.

'And he said, "If you go any further, you're not even coming back, so sorry man, you've got to go back to Adelaide." 

'It's my silly mistake. I should've turned an hour ago.'

Soobong has happily been living in a van for the past three years.

Since his departure from Big Brother in June, the 48-year-old delivery truck driver returned to the comforts of his four-wheel home.

The father-of-three has been happily living in the parking lot of his local gym, where he trains every day.

In a video shared to Instagram after the incident, the 48-year-old said: 'I messed up.'

'I usually live in front of the gym,' the fitness fanatic told Daily Mail from his mobile home in South Australia in June. 

'Once the gyms reopened [after coronavirus lockdowns lifted] I got back down to the gym. So, I'm living in front of the gym now.'

It's believed Soobong uses the shower and bathroom amenities at the gym, where he trains daily for one-and-a-half hours.

Soobong arrived at the Big Brother compound in a metal cage suspended by a crane, alongside three other latecomers, Shane Vincent, Hannah Campbell and Danni Keogh.

Despite his obvious physical advantages when it comes to the challenges, the others saw him as a threat and decided it was best to send him home sooner rather than later.

He was the third housemate to be evicted from the series, with 12 votes.

Before his entrance, a video package showed inside Soobong's cramped van, which featured a bed and portable camping stove.

'I've been living in my van, all by myself, for the last three years. And I love it! I've got everything I need within my reach,' he said.

'It is ultimate freedom,' he added.
