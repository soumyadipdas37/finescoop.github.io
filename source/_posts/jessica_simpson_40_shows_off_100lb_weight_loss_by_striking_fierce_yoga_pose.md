Jessica Simpson lost 100lbs last year after giving birth to her third child, Birdie Mae.

And the pop star turned entrepreneur can credit her yoga practice, in part, with helping shape both her body and mind. 

The results of all her hard work were put on display when she posted a photo of herself in a yoga warrior pose on Instagram on Monday. 

Mind and body: Jessica Simpson, 40, showed off her newly honed and toned figure while striking a yoga warrior pose

'Starting the week with a warrior mindset aligned with the beauty of the sunset,' she wrote in the caption of the picture that was taken in the backyard of her posh Hidden Hills home in Los Angeles.

Simpson made reference to the lovely sunset in the backdrop as well as the warrior II pose -- Virabhadrasana (veer-uh-buh-DRAHS-uh-nuh), which was named after Virabhadra, a fierce mythological Hindu warrior and incarnation of Shiva. 

For the sweet snap, she showed off her fabulous figure in skin-tight, animal-print yoga pants and a black sports bra that gave more than a hint of her toned midriff.

The Texas native had her long blonde tresses pulled back into a messy bun.

Simpson not only makes yoga a priority in her everyday routine, she has also turned it into a lucrative business by selling activewear through her signature clothing line, Jessica Simpson Collection.

Since launching in 2005 as a shoe collaboration with Nine West co-founder Vince Camuto, the company has diversified into clothing, handbags, sunglasses, accessories, jewelry, shoes and fragrances, among others. 

The Jessica Simpson Collection has been hauling in over $1 billion a year in revenue since 2010. 

Tipping the scale at about 240lbs following the birth of Birdie Mae in March 2019, Simpson turned to her longtime trainer Harley Pasternak for help in reclaiming her body after having delivered three children in eight years.

Her routine centered on five daily tasks: getting in her walking steps, exercise, eating healthy, getting at least seven hours of sleep and unplugging from technology for an hour. 

'The difference between this and the other times was that she worked out, yes, but her transformation was more about what she did on her own time,” Pasternak told People.

'She was so motivated and positive. She was saying that her body has not belonged to her for the past decade. Not in a bad way, in a positive way — her body has been designated to create life and now it's hers again and she's going to make it fantastic in a really enjoyable way.'

Simpson has been married to  former NFL player Eric Johnson since July 2014. They also are the proud parents to eight-year-old daughter Maxi and seven-year-old son Ace.
