Obina Ezeoke, 28, has been found guilty of double murder after an unprecedented five successive trials at the Old Bailey.

A trial at the Old Bailey heard Ezeoke crept into a family home and shot 21-year-old student Bervil Kalikaka-Ekofo in the back of his head while he slept in bed as part of a 'vendetta of violence'.

He then blasted the victim's aunt Annie Besala Ekofo, 53, in the chest when she came out of her bedroom dressed only in her underwear in the early hours of 15 September 2016, jurors heard.

Neither Bervil nor Annie were the intended targets, the Old Bailey was told.
