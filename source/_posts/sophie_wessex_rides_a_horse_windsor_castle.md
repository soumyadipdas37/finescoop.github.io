Amid the Covid-19 crisis, the Queen will return to Windsor in October, from where she will travel to Buckingham Palace for working visits.

Sophie appeared make-up free for her outing at her in-law's estate today, which comes after she became the first royal to pose for a sculptor.

Once complete, the piece of tactile art will be unveiled in 2021 to mark The Vision Foundation's centenary and will allow blind and partially sighted people to feel Sophie's likeness.

After the sculpture session Sophie, who is patron of charity Vision Foundation, spoke of the challenges faced during the Covid-19 pandemic by those who are unable to see.

She said: 'For the blind and partially sighted amongst us, these past months have been especially challenging.

'However, through the care that the Vision Foundation has extended to those in difficulty, I am hopeful that the people we care for will feel empowered within their communities.'
