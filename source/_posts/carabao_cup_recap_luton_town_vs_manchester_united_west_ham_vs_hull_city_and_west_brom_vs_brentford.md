Newport 3-1 Watford

West Brom 2-2 Brentford (4-5 pens)

West Ham 5-1 Hull

Luton 0-3 Manchester United

A flattering scoreline for United, who had to work hard until the closing stages.

Greenwood wraps it up with a deserved goal!

He picks up the ball on the right, performs a couple of step-overs and places one into the far corner.

The substitutes really changed this game.

Greenwood causing all sorts of problems. This time he plays in Lingard on the left, who fires a powerful strike just over.

Two minutes of added time to come.

89 mins: Greenwood shows nice feet on the right hand side of the box before forcing a save out of Shea at his near post.

Game over.

United break and Greenwood holds up the ball on the edge of the box before allowing Rashford to take over. The Englishman bursts into the box and finishes with aplomb.

81 mins: Henderson 's first United save and it's a great one!

Tom Lockyear's back post header is destined for the net before the new United stopper sticks out a hand. The follow up is cleared off the line.

Three subs for the visitors as Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood replace Juan Mata, Odion Ighalo and Donny van de Beek.

Two changes for Luton as Harry Cornick replaces Jordan Clark and Elliot Lee comes on for George Moncur.

73 mins: Good save!

Donny van de Beek goes close to making it two, picking up a loose ball in the box and forcing a smart stop out of Shea at his near post.

68 mins: Peter Kioso picks up a yellow for a late on on Bailly.

63 mins: Off the line!

United break in numbers and Ighalo chooses to go alone, his shot blocked by a defender.

Mata retrieves it on the right and finds Lingard at the back post, who sees his volley blocked by Ryan Tunnicliffe with the keeper beaten.

57 mins: Still a tight game  here. United moving the ball a little better since the break.

A totally one-siided affair.

The full-time whistle can't come soon enough for Hull as Yarmolenko grabs his second with a simple finish from Anderson's pull-back.

Back underway at Luton.

Haller takes the ball round the keeper and finishes after being played through by Lanzini.

Brentford are through!

Raya dives the right way to save Grady Diangana's effort, giving Christian Norgaard the chance to decide the shootout. He does so, finding the bottom corner.

Another pair of successful spot-kicks for both teams.

Both sides have scored their first two spot-kicks in the shootout.

Branislav Ivanovic, Ivan Toney Josh da Silva and Conor Gallagher all finding the net.

United lucky to be leading...

Mata sends the keeper the wrong way to end a poor half on a high note.

Another penalty for the Red Devils as George Moncur brings down Brandon Williams.

The visitors pull one back as Mallik Wilks finishes from an angle after latching on to a long ball.

This one will go to penalties.

A huge win for Newport County, who are are into the League Cup fourth round for the first time in their history.

Stipe Perica gets a red on his second apperance for violent conduct against Brandon Cooper.

31 mins: Not the most impressive start from United. The short summer break could have something to do with that.

84 mins: Newport make two late changes. Lewis Collins and Robbie Willmott on for Scot Bennett and goalscorer Joss Labadie.

Yarmolenko makes it three from the penalty spot. Almost impossible to see any way back for the visitors.

A goal and two assists so far for him tonight.

78 mins: Gallagher misses a big chance to put the home side back in front, volleying over from close range.

23 mins: It's end-to-end stuff here. This time Fred's deflected strike from distance almost catches the keeper out but it's just wide.

Back underway at West Ham.

It's another penalty as Marcus Forss is brought down by Kipre.

Marcus Forss smashes it straight down the middle.

71 mins: Ivan Toney replaces scorer Marcondes.

16 mins: Best chance of the game so far as Donny van de Beek steps over Lingard's low cross, allowing Juan Mata to force a good diving save from James Shea.

67 mins: Two changes for Brentford as Christian Norgaard and Josh da Silva come on for Sergi Canos and Jan Zamburek.

Newport restore their two-goal advantage as Padraig Amond nets his first goal of the season.

Edwards wins a penalty after drawing a foul out of Goode in the box. Robson-Kanu goes the same way and its the same result.

What a goal! What a way to respond.

10 minutes until the evening's late kick-off gets underway.

30 mins: Hull have played some decent football but their attacks really are lacking any cutting edge. Yet to create a real chance of note.

West Ham have just released a statement confirming that David Moyes, Issa Diop and Josh Cullen have returned positive tests for COVID-19.

Robert Snodgrass scores against his former club and it's a lovely goal too.

Andriy Yarmolenko chips the ball to the left side of the box where he meets it with a brilliant volley into the corner.

A deserved lead.

An enforced change for Hull as George Honeyman comes on for an injured Richard Snmallwood.

12 mins: Big chance for the home side.

It's almost a moment to remember for 18-year-old Harrison Ashby, who cuts in from the right and forces a good save out of George Long.
