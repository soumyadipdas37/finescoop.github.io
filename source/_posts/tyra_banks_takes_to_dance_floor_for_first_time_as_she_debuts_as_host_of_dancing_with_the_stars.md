Tyra Banks took the dance floor as the new host of Dancing With The stars during Monday night's highly anticipated season 29 premiere on ABC.

The 46-year-old supermodel, who replaced show veterans Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews, donned a stunning bright red ball gown and matching arm-length gloves.

'Whoo! Oh, my gosh, I can't believe it. I'm finally here. My family and I have been fans of this show since day one. And look, mama, I'm in the ballroom!' shouted Banks excitedly into her microphone.

'Welcome to Dancing with the stars! Right here, right now!' 

Tyra rocked a voluminous head of curls and a dramatic face of feature flattering makeup as she reacted animatedly to the show's prerecorded applause.

She spoke directly to viewers at home and admitted how much of a 'dream come true' her hosting gig on Dancing With The Stars was for her.  

Banks added: 'I'm so grateful to be a part of this incredible legacy.'

In an effortless transition, Tyra addressed the social-distancing guidelines in place, down to the positioning of the judges and dancers and even the layout of the show's iconic ballroom.

'As you can see, to ensure the safety of our cast and our phenomenal crew, we've given the ballroom a serious makeover. Even the judges have made some room for social distancing,' said the former America's Next Top Model host.

She then introduced the judges for season 29, which included series regulars Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba and the newly added Derek Hough.  

'And we want to welcome our new judge, six-time mirror ball champion, Derek Hough, announced Tyra, before inquiring about the 35-year-old pro dancer's excitement towards his new gig. 

'This is where America first met you, as a dancer, and now you're a judge. What is it like to be on that side of the desk?'

Derek gushed over how much Dancing With The Stars 'means to [him]' and that he is 'so excited to be here.'

Tyra explained to viewers that veteran judge Len Goodman 'wasn't able to safely travel from the U.K. to the United States,' hence why Hough replaced him.      

After Backstreet Boys' AJ McLean 'shot right out of the cannon' with his dance partner Cheryl Burke with the jive, Banks returned to the floor in an eye-popping fuchsia pantsuit.

Tyra did not hold back as she engaged in frequent laugh-filled banter with the judges, coaches, and celebrity contestants, while keeping in tune with the show's fast paced format.
