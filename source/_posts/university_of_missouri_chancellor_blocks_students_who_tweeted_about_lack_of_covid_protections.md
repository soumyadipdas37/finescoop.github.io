Students at the University of Missouri have slammed the school's chancellor for blocking them after several took to social media to complain about the lack of protective measures taken to fight COVID-19. 

A letter sent by Texas lawyer and Mizzou alum, Christopher W. Bennett, said that Chancellor Mun Choi was infringing on the First Amendment rights of students by blocking them. 

Bennett shared that he had been retained by students, journalists and other individuals who had been blocked by Choi's personal account - @munychoi4545 - for 'speaking critically about issues related to the University's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.'

'Not only is it immoral and repugnant for President Choi to block students and other persons on social media who are trying to raise awareness of campus safety issues in the middle of a global pandemic, it is also unlawful,' Bennett said in his letter. 

Students have been sharing clips of their abysmal living conditions and lack of food they've received in their meals from the university. 

Many students forced off campus, due to testing positive with the coronavirus, have not been getting assigned to quarantine living.

Several students were sent to hotels and other living arrangements after coming down with the virus

And while some of the students did tag Choi, several shared that they were quickly blocked for just sharing their opinion about the conditions.  

Christian Basi, a spokesperson for the university, said that Choi's personal Twitter account had been blocking students but had since removed the blocks

Christian Basi, a spokesperson for the university, said that Choi's personal Twitter account had been blocking students. 

Basi explained to USA Today that it was due in part to Choi being on the receiving end of messages/tweets that were disrespectful and not constructive [and] some contained profanity.' 

The blocks have since been removed, Basi stated, adding that it was 'because the university does not need the distraction caused by this matter.' 

As of Wednesday, the university reported that there are 1,133 total student cases of coronavirus. That number is up significantly from the 168 cases that had been around on August 24 when in-person classes resumed.  

Universities across the country have not delivered on their promises when it comes to adequately tackling protective measures for the virus. 

Students at New York University shared their own viral videos showing off the lack of food they were given, with many getting vegan meals or just juice.
