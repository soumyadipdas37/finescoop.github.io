A female driver has penned a scathing note to her local parking inspector begging him not to issue her 'another' $100 fine. 

The woman left the message on her windshield after parking outside the University of Queensland campus in Brisbane suburb Kelvin Grove.

But her plea appears to have been ignored, with a photo posted on Reddit showing a ticket tucked under the driver's windscreen wiper. 

'Dear Mr Parking Inspector,' the note reads. 

A female driver has penned a scathing note to her local parking inspector begging him not to issue her 'another' $100 fine

'It is not my financial responsibility if Brisbane council have technical problems.

'I am a resident in this shi***** street.

'You might feel good to not be an a***hole today.

'Kind regards, Kel.'

The poster accused the driver of having parked in a disabled car park. 

But closer inspection of the parking limits on the street show it is possible they parked in a 15 minute car park. 

Some locals were sympathetic with the driver, claiming a move to digitise parking permits had created problems for residential parking. 

'BCC stopped issuing parking permits to residents, moving to a digital system,' another resident wrote.

'I've had a go at the parking inspector in my area for doing it, for ticketing a car that has the old interim permit in the window that has barely moved in 6 months. 

'Got a snarky reply that his job is to scan plates and write tickets.' 

A Brisbane City Council spokesperson refuted the claims.  

'There are no technical issues with Council's digital permit system,' a Brisbane City Council spokesperson told 7NEWS.com.au. 

'Digital permits are effective immediately upon lodgement of an application.

'Residents will be notified if their application is subsequently refused before the digital permit is no longer valid.' 

Some argued the driver may have deserved the fine.

'I don't think it's a disabled spot. I can see the infringement notice has the words 'parked longer than,' one person wrote.

'If that's the case looks like the ticket is fine. That 1/4hr sign doesn't have a "resident permits excepted" note like the ones further up the hill,' another agreed. 

Others said her choice of words probably didn't help her case.

'Wow, if I was a parking inspector that note would definitely make me find an excuse to fine her. Really pulling at the heartstrings with that one,' one said.
