Leslie Mann and her filmmaker husband Judd Apatow ventured out in Malibu on Tuesday to take care of some shopping.

The 48-year-old Blockers star and the 52-year-old King Of Staten Island director were seen shopping for clothes at a store in the coastal Southern California city.

Afterward, the longtime couple drove to a restaurant for dinner in the area. 

Stocking up: Leslie Mann, 48, and her filmmaker husband Judd Apatow, 52, stopped at a clothing shop in Malibu on Tuesday to do some shopping before heading to dinner nearby

Leslie stuck with a casual look while looking at new clothing.

She had on a white ribbed tank top that showed off her fit arms, and she tucked the top into her high-waisted black jeans.

The 5ft7in actress had her jeans rolled up slightly above her ankles, and she wore a set of black mule heels.

She had her golden blonde locks parted down the middle and cascading down her shoulders in gentle waves.

Leslie rounded out her look with a pair of black sunglasses, and she sported a mask in accordance with an order from California Governor Gavin Newsom requiring all people in the state to wear them when in public places.

Her husband Judd also had on a casual outfit with a gray striped polo shirt and a pair of dark blue jeans with white trainers, along with a navy blue cloth mask.

Leslie and Judd's professional lives have been nearly entangled as their personal lives, and she has worked as an actress for him multiple times.

She appeared in a small supporting role in his 2005 feature directorial debut The 40-Year-Old Virgin, but Leslie had a larger supporting role in his second feature Knocked Up (2007), which she reprised, this time as one of the leads with Paul Rudd, in 2012's This Is 40.

She appeared again in 2009's Funny People as the former fiancée of Adam Sandler's character, whom he tries to reunite with after he's diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia. 

Simple style: Judd wore a gray striped polo shirt and dark jeans with white sneakers. He released his most recent film, the Pete Davidson–starring The King Of Staten Island, in June

Family affair: Leslie has played lead and supporting characters in multiple films directed by her husband, but their daughters Maude, 22, and Iris, 17, have also regularly appeared in his films; shown in 2015

Judd's films have become a kind of family business, not just for his wife but also for their two daughters, Maude, 22, and Iris, 17.

Both have been featured in multiple films from the stand-up comic, but Maude has recently expanded into larger roles.

She currently appears as Lexi Howard on HBO's hit teen drama Euphoria, and she took on one of her biggest film roles to date in her father's Pete Davidson vehicle The King Of Staten Island, which was released in June.

Moving on up: Maude most recently expanded her range to play a major character on the HBO high school drama Euphoria
