The 30-year-old actress opted for black skinny jeans, that featured a rip above her knee. 

She added a black crewneck sweatshirt and black Dr. Marten boots adding height to her look. 

For some added touches, she wore a gold watch and layered gold necklaces.

Ashley left her blonde hair down in wavy style and parted to the side as she left with iced coffee in hand. 

Later in the day, the star took to social media to encourage her fans to vote. 

Using a filter, her face was colorfully colored with hearts, smiley faces, the female gender symbol, flowers and a voting sticker.

'Vote!' was written across her forehead, while 'power to the people,' was near her hairline and 'BLM,' was plastered on her cheek. 

Congratulations: On Tuesday, she shared a video of her her mother ringing a bell to mark the end of her cancer treatment (pictured in 2015)

Happy moment: Captioning the image, the star said that she's 'so proud' of her mother as she expressed her love for her 

She held up a dainty gold necklace that read 'vote,' and she echoed the sentiment by writing the same word over the selfie.
