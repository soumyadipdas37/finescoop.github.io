Leighton Meester made her third surfing trip in less than a week, as she returned to her happy place on Tuesday. 

The 34-year-old Gossip Girl star, who has previously revealed surfing is her go-to workout, looked liked a pro out on the water, next to her husband, Adam Brody. 

Less than a week after Brody confirmed they had welcomed their second child, a son, the pair looked happy to be catching waves together again in Malibu.

As she exited her car, the mother-of-two changed into a form-fitting wetsuit, which hugged every curve of her toned postpartum figure.

Prior to slipping into her surfing gear, Meester put on a very busty display in a grey tank top, which she styled with a pair of black sunglasses and Birkenstocks.  

Like her husband, she toted her own surfboard across the shore and appeared eager to jump into the water.
