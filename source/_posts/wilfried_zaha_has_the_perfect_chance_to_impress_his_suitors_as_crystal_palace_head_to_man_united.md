Does it even count as summer if Wilfried Zaha isn't agitating to leave Crystal Palace for somewhere with a little bit more prestige and prominence?

The opening weeks of the season are like an enormous shop window for the winger to illustrate his class and this year has been no exception.

Zaha started 2020-21 with a clinical volley to settle Palace's Premier League opener against Southampton last Saturday and once again enters the limelight at Old Trafford on Saturday.

It's been another summer window packed with transfer speculation for the Palace winger

The fact Zaha will come up against Manchester United, where he endured a painful couple of years between 2013 and 2015, should be irrelevant really.

That's because as long as the transfer window remains open - and it does until October 5 - Zaha will know he has the chance to impress potential suitors and maybe get that long-awaited move.

But what better way to remind everybody of your class than by scoring or at least playing well away to United? By helping Palace win at Old Trafford as they did at a similar stage of the season last year.

Furthermore, it's a United side hampered by a shortage of match fitness, with Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes, Mason Greenwood and Aaron Wan-Bissaka among Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's regulars that may be absent.

It's a golden opportunity for Zaha. As shop windows go, this isn't your Thornton Heath backstreet, it's Harrods or Selfridges.

There has been interest, as usual. The Ivorian has been linked with Chelsea, Everton, Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco and Borussia Dortmund this summer.

The interest rises and fizzles out again as it has in the past few summers. 12 months ago, Arsenal and Everton were the two contenders for Zaha's signature but Palace wanted as much as £80m and that proved too expensive.

He met with then Arsenal boss Unai Emery but the Gunners offered only £40m. Everton bid £50m but Palace held firm. 

With United due 25 per cent of any sell-on fee, a stipulation of the deal that saw Zaha return to Palace for £6m in 2015, Palace need to ensure they get top dollar.  

But with Covid ravaging football finances, that £80m asking price would almost certainly be less this summer but it will take some sparkling Zaha performances in Palace's next three games - intriguingly against United, Everton and Chelsea - to reignite interest.

There is a school of thought among some Palace fans that Zaha reserves his best performances for the transfer windows as he tries to push through a transfer.

In 2016, just after Zaha had helped Palace reach the FA Cup final, where they lost to United, Tottenham submitted a £12m bid that was described as 'ridiculous' by chairman Steve Parish.

Spurs could offer Champions League football but didn't up their offer and Parrish shut down any chance of Zaha being sold. The winger didn't score or set up a goal for the remainder of the window.

At the end of the season, Zaha committed to Palace, signing a new five-year contract and leaving the summer of 2017 free of speculation. He signed despite interest from Spurs, Man City and Arsenal.

He duly went on to enjoy a good season, scoring nine Premier League goals and creating another five, with a late season flourish steering Roy Hodgson's Palace away from relegation danger.

The summer of 2018 saw Chelsea submit a £30m offer, while Spurs retained an interest, and Zaha produced some of his best form during the window, scoring against Fulham and Watford before going on to have a superb season having extended his contract again.

But last year, despite that Arsenal and Everton interest, Zaha couldn't produce his best form during the early season and that set the tone for a sub-par campaign.

He is contracted at Selhurst Park until 2023 but little time passes without the 27-year-old making the transfer gossip columns.

The way that Palace's form collapsed post-restart, when they lost seven consecutive games to drop from ninth to an eventual finish of 14th, no doubt reinforced a desire to make a step up.

And Palace seem to regard his departure as inevitable, whether this year or sometime soon, as shown by their purchase of the talented 22-year-old Ebere Eze from Queens Park Rangers.

Eze would appear to be Zaha's successor on the left wing even if Hodgson would be delighted if the pair were able to work together for this season at least.

But there's no denying that Palace's trip to Old Trafford allows Zaha the perfect opportunity to show his suitors why they need to bid for him.

Visits to Old Trafford no doubt stir all kinds of emotions for Zaha but getting one over his former club could have positive implications well beyond the 90 minutes on Saturday.
