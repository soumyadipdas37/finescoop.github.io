Her post comes after ex Kyle is said to have been left devastated after his model fiancée Annie allegedly admitted to a fling with a toyboy during their explosive split.

The Manchester City footballer and Annie broke up in March 2019 after she discovered he had been unfaithful with Ex On The Beach reality star Laura Brown. 

Kyle and Annie have three children together, and during their split, he fathered a child with Lauryn Goodman - a son who she refers to as Junior, now five-months-old - following a whirlwind romance. 

The on-off couple rekindled their romance in June where he is said to have proposed to the mother of three of his children.

Annie has now allegedly admitted that during their split, she had a fling with a toyboy in February after being introduced by mutual friends but ended the relationship as soon as they got back together.   

A source told The Sun: 'Kyle is devastated but after everything he's put Annie through he's now getting a taste of his own medicine. And it's proving to be a bitter pill to swallow.'  

They added: 'It all seemed to be settling down — and now this. Annie's confession has knocked him for six. He doesn't feel like he can trust her anymore. 

'He knows he doesn't have a leg to stand on but he's stung by it because Annie has always been the perfect partner.'

The source continued that Kyle is 'worried' she still has 'feelings' for her ex and it is 'driving a massive wedge between them'.

They added that she kept the romance 'quiet' as she didn't want to cause 'any upset'.

It's been a tumultuous year for Kyle and Annie after his former flame Lauryn welcomed a baby boy with the footballer following a short-lived romance during their split. It is his fourth child, he shares sons Roman, Riaan and Reign with Annie. 

Lauryn giving birth to Junior came just weeks after Kyle breached the government's lockdown instructions by holding a sex party with two escorts.

He held the sex party just a day before he had urged supporters to stay at home amid the coronavirus pandemic.  

After the news broke out, Kyle said: 'I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week. I understand my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. 

'As such, I want to apologise to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down.' 

In June, the Mirror reported that Kyle had popped the question to Annie with an epic floral proposal at her home after she admitted she was open to rekindling their romance.

The mother of his three children had just lifted the lid on their painful break-up, admitting she still struggles with the pain of their ended relationship, after she discovered he cheated on her.

However the sportsman reportedly pulled out all the stops to get his partner of nine years back by decorating her abode in an elaborate white rose arrangement, complete with a heart-shaped sculpture and scattered petals. 

MailOnline contacted Kyle and Annie's representatives for comment at the time. 

The reported proposal had come just weeks after Annie told The Sun On Sunday she still struggles with the loss of her relationship with Kyle, having stood by him throughout his rise to prominence as a football star.

She said: 'I don't know what my thoughts or feelings are any more. I feel dead inside. Each day is filled with pain.

'I don't think I'll ever be the same again because of what he's done. It makes me really sad that I've been damaged so badly when I've done nothing to deserve it.

Tumultuous: It's been a tumultuous year for Kyle, as months ago the footballer breached the government's lockdown instructions by holding a sex party with two escorts (pictured in 2018) 

'I've tried to hate him but how can I hate the man my kids love so much? Before the infidelity he was my best friend, my soulmate. I could count on him for anything.'

Annie also claimed that days before Kyle allegedly met Lauryn, she suffered a miscarriage, and was devastated when he confessed that the reality star was pregnant with his baby.

In March 2019, Annie dumped Kyle when she learned he'd sent messages to Ex On The Beach reality star Laura Brown.

She was then further devastated to learn he'd fathered a child with Lauryn, they had a relationship after he and Annie had split. 

Lauryn was previously targeted by Annie on Instagram Stories, when she appeared to reveal her baby's gender after she gave birth in April.  

Taking to her Instagram Stories, the former WAG wrote: 'FYI... it's a BOY!' 

In another dig, Annie posted: 'A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless h*e.'  

Lauryn took to Instagram to post a reaction to Annie's remark, writing: 'This is harassment. I've just had a newborn baby and I'm dealing with this on a Sunday morning!' 

The reality star also hit out at the footballer earlier this month after he said he is a 'role model' in an interview.

Lauryn also accused Kyle of 'stalking her' on social media and acting like their son 'doesn't exist'.
