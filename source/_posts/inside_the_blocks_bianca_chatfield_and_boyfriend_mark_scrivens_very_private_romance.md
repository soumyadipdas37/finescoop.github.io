They just celebrated their first anniversary as a couple.  

And now notoriously private reality TV couple, Bianca Chatfield, 38, and Mark Scrivens, 42, have revealed details of their romance after meeting online. 

'It's the easiest relationship I have ever been in,' The Block's Bianca told Woman's Day magazine.

'I've learned a lot about Mark while living together, what fights to have, what fights not to have,' she said.  

The brunette beauty said the pair are now looking for a 'fixer upper' in the Victorian capital, which will become their 'forever' home. 

The couple celebrated their one year anniversary in April. 

Earlier this year, Bianca told the Herald Sun they have both remained private for the sake of their bond. 

'We just have so much fun together and get along so well,' she added to the magazine. Bianca appeared on The Block in 2018 alongside best friend Carla Dziwoki (pictured far right)

'A lot of people wouldn't know we've been together for a year because we were so conscious of keeping it on the down low,' she told the publication.   

While they initially bonded over their shared experiences of appearing on reality TV, Bianca said their relationship is very much the real deal.

 'For us, it was a real relationship and nothing to do with TV,' she began.

'Even though I'm a public person I've always kept my personal life private. But now we're like whatever, it's going well and really cruisy,' she added.

Bianca said they initially traded a few messages, even though she had never watched Married At First Sight. 

She described their early exchanges as 'a bit bizarre and random', but said they 'share a lot of the same interests'.

Bad match: Mark appeared on last year's season of MAFS, where he was paired with Ning Suriasing. The relationship fizzed quickly
