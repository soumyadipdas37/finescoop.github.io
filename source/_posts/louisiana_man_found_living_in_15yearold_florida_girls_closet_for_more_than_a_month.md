Jonathan Rossmoine, 36, has been arrested after a 15-year-old Florida girl's parents found he had been living in their daughter's bedroom closet for more than a month 

A Louisiana man has been arrested after a 15-year-old Florida girl's parents found he had been living in their daughter's bedroom closet for more than a month after he met the teen online two years ago and traveled to meet her for sex. 

Jonathan Rossmoine, 36, was arrested and charged with multiple sex crimes Sunday after the child's parents learned he had been secretly living in her bedroom at their family home in Spring Hill, Hernando County. 

Rossmoine allegedly confessed to traveling from Louisiana to Florida on multiple occasions to have sex with the child, who described the 36-year-old as her boyfriend. 

Police said he then moved into the girl's room in August, where he would hide out from her parents in the closet and emerge when they left the house. 

Hernando County investigators were called to a home in Spring Hill Sunday when the girl's parents found Rossmoine living in her closet.  

Police said the 36-year-old first made contact with his victim online two years ago through VRChat when the girl was around 13.

The suspected pedophile drove from Louisiana to Spring Hill to meet his victim and have sex with her on several occasions since they first communicated, police said.

Rossmaine then allegedly began living on and off in the girl's bedroom from August 19. 

The suspect managed to remain undiscovered for around five weeks with the help of the teenager, staying hidden in the closet when the girl's parents were home and coming out when they left for work.

'He and the young lady came up with the idea that he could just stay in her room if he hid in the closet whenever the parents came in,' Hernando County Sheriff's Office Detective Tom Cameron said.

'They kept the bedroom door closed and locked and whenever someone came to the door it gave them an opportunity to run and hide in the closet and open up the door to where maybe she was changing or something.'

The parents heard noises coming from the bedroom Sunday and were shocked to discover Rossmoine in the storage space. 

Rossmoine was arrested and charged with four counts of lewd and lascivious behavior with a victim between the age of 12 and 16 and one count of obscene communication and travel to meet after use of a computer to lure a child. 

The teenage victim referred to her alleged abuser as her boyfriend, police said.   

Child psychologist Dr. Wendy Rice told Fox 13 the shocking case was a warning to parents about the dangers of the online world to children. 

'Kids can be doing things under our noses and in your house that you might not be aware of that could shock you,' said Rice. 

'Get the electronics out of the bedroom. That is key. None of us really need to be sleeping with our phones next to our beds and least of all teens.'

Rossmoine is being held in the Hernando County Jail on a $25,000 bond.
