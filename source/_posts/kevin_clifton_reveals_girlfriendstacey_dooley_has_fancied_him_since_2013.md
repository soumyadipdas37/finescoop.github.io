'I like! [heart eyes emoji] God I love Strictly!' 

Kevin wrote alongside the picture that two new professional male dances were unveiled that year - himself and Aljaz Skorjanec.

Months later, in 2019, it was revealed the pair with dating, after Stacey split from her long-term boyfriend Sam Tucknott.

Earlier this year, the dancer revealed that he was so desperate to be paired with eventual winner Stacey, he called in a favour with one of the choreographers.

Speaking on The Kevin Clifton Show podcast he revealed he asked Strictly choreographer Jason Gilkison, who he worked with on the Burn The Floor tour, for a hand. 

He said: 'I was a fan of your documentaries and for the last couple of years I'd tweeted you a few times, going 'I really liked your documentary', and you were like, ''Oh cheers Kev!'' 

Couple: Kevin and Stacey started dating after she starred on Strictly. The pair were crowned champions and became a couple in April 2019 (pictured on the show in 2018)  

'So yeah, I was like ''Stacey Dooley's wicked. She'll be really interesting... great just to talk to about her experiences.''

'Once I heard you were doing it, I said to Jason, ''Remember that time when I had broken shins and it was the difference between Burn The Floor going bust or going to Broadway?''

'You (Jason) were like ''I need you to give a big performance tonight'' and I was, ''Yes I'll do it. I'll take lots of ibuprofen and go on stage''.

Jason then went onto work on Strictly, and when he and Kevin were reunited the dancer asked him to try and 'push' for Stacey to be partnered with him.

Meant to be! Earlier this year, the dancer revealed that he was so desperate to be paired with eventual winner Stacey, he called in a favour with one of the choreographers (pictured in 2018)  

Kevin added: 'Jason was like ''What do you want?'' and I said, ''Well I've heard Stacey Dooley may be doing Strictly. If there's any chance you could push for her to be my partner...'' It's something I don't normally do.' 

MailOnline contacted representatives for Strictly Come Dancing for comment at the time.   

During the same podcast Stacey made the same admission that she 'pushed' to be paired with Kevin, and claimed bosses originally wanted to pair her with AJ Pritchard.  

Insisting she believed they'd be coupled with other stars of the series, Stacey said: 'I imagine at some point, total speculation, that you were meant to have Lauren [Steadman] or Katie [Piper] and they were going to put me with AJ. 

'I pushed for you for whatever reason. If I hadn't been so vocal, I wouldn't have gotten you. I really wanted you. You're so nurturing and patient.

'I remember telling Louise, I would like Kevin please! She told me it doesn't really work like that [laughs]'

In March, Kevin announced that he decided to quit Strictly after seven years in the professional line-up after landing his dream West End role in Strictly ballroom.
