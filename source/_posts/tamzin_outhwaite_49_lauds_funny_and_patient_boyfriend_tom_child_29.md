Tamzin Outhwaite has praised her boyfriend Tom Child for making her work-life balance 'so much more doable'.

The EastEnders actress - who has daughters Florence, 12, and Marnie, eight - recently returned to work after six months at home amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Following her return, the star, 49, admitted that while she 'worries' her children now have a 'false sense of security' because she has been present a lot more than usual, she is grateful to Tom for helping her out.

More doable: Tamzin Outhwaite has praised her boyfriend Tom Child for making her work-life balance 'so much more doable'

She wrote on Instagram: 'This kind , funny, patient, talented, loving ,dynamic & hot man makes my daily juggle so much more doable and so much more fun....

'As I left the house for work at 6am, I then got a call from my 8 yr old crying & asking where I was. @tc_childie gave her cuddles, made her breakfast & lunch for school, all ready for @ginger_appreciator to take over the school run...

'I worry that the last 6 months of me being at home with my girls has given them a false sense of security, that I will always be home now. I need to work...

'I love my job. But I could not do it without this support network. @tc_childie I love you so very much. @ginger_appreciator you have always been my right hand woman & I love you too. #ittakesavillage #backtowork #thejuggleisreal #wouldbelostwithoutyou #luckygirl (sic)'

The actress has also been juggling her eating habits, as just two weeks ago the star admitted she was attempting to go alcohol, dairy and meat-free.

She wrote on Twitter: 'Back to no alcohol, no dairy , no meat. Last month I did 31 days... this time I want to beat it, then try not to drink, eat cheesecake and salt beef sandwiches all in one day ! (sic)'

Her gushing profession comes after Tamzin insisted that she is 'not having a midlife crisis' by dating a toyboy 21 years her junior. She said her relationship with personal trainer Tom is both 'unexpected and magic'.

But the soap star also revealed that some people think she is having a midlife crisis due to the substantial age gap. 'People think I’m having a midlife crisis, but actually, not all men want a younger woman,' she told Prima magazine.

'There’s Joan Collins, Sam Taylor-Johnson and Helena [Bonham-Carter] with younger men, so I'm in really lovely company.

'Tom’s very good for my mental and physical health. The other way around, no one says anything about a younger woman do they?'

She was previously married to ex-EastEnders actor Tom Ellis, but they divorced in 2014. The pair have two daughters, Flo, 11, and seven-year-old Marnie.

It has been claimed that ex Tom cheated on her with Australian actress, Emilie de Ravin, in 2013 as they filmed for the TV series Once Upon A Time while in America.

But since their split, the actress says she has stopped 'giving two hoots' about what other people think of her, describing it as 'a lovely feeling'.
