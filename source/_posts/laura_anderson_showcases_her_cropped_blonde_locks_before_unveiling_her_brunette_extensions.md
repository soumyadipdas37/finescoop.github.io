She's known for her flowing blonde locks.

And Laura Anderson showcased an altogether different look on Tuesday as she shared a clip of her cropped natural hair before undergoing a stunning hair transformation. 

Taking to her Instagram stories, the Love Island star, 31, told her fans 'this is the reality of my hair' before eventually revealing her new flowing brunette tresses.

The stunner opted to document her day in the salon chair as she decided to switch up her look for the autumn.

Laura started off by showing her extension-free hair, as she turned this way and that to display her shorter blonde tresses, telling her fans this was the 'reality' of her hair.

She then told her followers that she's planning on going darker and shorter, ahead of her big transformation.

Laura then later shared a clip of her newly-dyed brunette hair ahead of her extensions, with the Scottish beauty adding: 'This little mullet situation is what happens when you bleach your hair your whole life.'

The reality star then revealed her longer tresses and ran her hands through her luxurious extensions as she displayed the finished result.    

She then showcased the end result after it was styled into voluminous waves for a night out.  

Laura's new hair comes after she was forced to speak out earlier this month after she sparked controversy with her 'changing face'.

Laura had been filming Love Island spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George when a photo shared by her co-stars saw fans branding her recognisable.

Hitting back at hurtful comments with a make-up free selfie a day later, Laura said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.

'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse.

'Like, "Laura doesn't look like Laura any more". It's really nice to read all those comments and I just think people need to get over the fact that a picture is just a picture. 

'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.'    

Laura hit back after social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance.

One wrote: 'OMG is that Laura !!!!!! I did not realise that was Laura!!!!! 

Another typed: 'That's not Laura!!! I didn't even recognise her!,' while a third chimed: 'wow laura doesn't even look like laura... is that even Laura....' (sic)

Another follower referenced the reality star's cosmetic procedures as they added: 'I don't even recognise Laura since her surgery. Shame she was so pretty and didn't need to change her appearance at all.' (sic)   

Defence: The star's outing comes after she was forced to speak out earlier this month after she sparked controversy with her 'changing face' 

The media personality has made no secret of having Botox and lip fillers in the past - treatments she claimed she planned before entering the villa in 2018.  

It's been a tough time for Laura who revealed earlier this month that she had split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom just days after moving back to Scotland.

Despite initially intending for Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off.  

Stirling born Laura told fans on an Instagram story: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north.

'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.'

Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.

Laura, who moved to the swanky Park Circus area of Glasgow earlier in the month, said she had fully hoped Tom would join her in her new home.

She had gushed that she'd never met anyone like him before adding: 'I'm still going to move to Scotland and Tom is looking to follow me up in the next six months. He's the cherry on top of the cake.'
