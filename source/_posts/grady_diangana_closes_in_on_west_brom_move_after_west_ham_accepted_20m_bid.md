Grady Diangana has been given permission to discuss personal terms with West Brom after they had a bid for the attacking midfielder accepted by West Ham.

The Baggies have made their move for the 22 year-old, who spent last season on loan at the Hawthorns, with an offer worth in the region of £20m including add-ons.

West Brom are keen to finalise terms with Diangana and wrap up his return as soon as possible, mindful of rival interest.

West Brom are edging closer to signing Grady Diangana after successful loan spell last season

Fulham manager Scott Parker is also a big fan of Diangana and the Cottagers are considering their own move to try and hijack the deal.

Brighton and Aston Villa are also interested in Diangana, who signed a six-year West Ham contract that runs until 2025 just last January.

Diangana made 31 appearances for West Brom last season, scoring eight goals and setting up six more to play a key role for former Hammers manager Slaven Bilic’s side as they won promotion back to the Premier League.

West Ham are looking to cash in on the midfielder as they look to generate transfer funds

West Ham have been considering their options since Diangana’s return ahead of the new season.

They initially hoped to offload one of their bigger earning stars such as Jack Wilshere, Felipe Anderson or Manuel Lanzini in order to raise funds for their own transfer business.

But having been unable to they are now preparing to cash in on Diangana.

The England youth international made his senior West Ham debut in September 2018, scoring twice in an 8-0 League Cup win against Macclesfield, and has featured a total of 21 times for the club after coming through their academy.
