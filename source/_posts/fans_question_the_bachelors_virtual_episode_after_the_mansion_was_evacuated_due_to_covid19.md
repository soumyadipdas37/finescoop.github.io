On Wednesday, The Bachelor mansion was evacuated amid the COVID-19 pandemic, sending Locky Gilbert and the remaining ladies back to their respective homes. 

Although the handsome hunk's journey continued on Thursday, Locky, 30, now had to vet the women vying for his heart via video. 

During the show, fans flocked to Twitter to question the point of the virtual episode, with many noticing most of the cast appeared to have camera crews in their homes. 

'Did they take home a cameraman?' On Thursday, fans questioned The Bachelor's virtual episode after the mansion was evacuated due to COVID-19. Pictured: the cast

'Top quality filming. Did each girl take a camera man home with them????' Tweeted one viewer. 

'Lol iso with a camera crew and producer,' added another.  

Meanwhile, a third viewer questioned the turn of events.

'So there are production and camera crews in every girls home. Isn't that higher risk compared to just staying in the mansion?' they wrote.

Another wrote: 'So they can have a camera crew in their houses during lockdown?'  

'How is it safer to send a film crew to all of their individual houses than keeping them in the mansion?' echoed a fifth fan. 

At the end of the episode, Bec Colwell was sent packing after she failed to receive a rose from Locky.

The show's first-ever virtual rose ceremony saw each of the remaining ladies standing by a rose. However, they could only pick it up if Locky called out their name.  

Following the outcome, fans slammed the ceremony on Twitter, with one viewer commenting on how 'weird' it must have been for Bel, 25. 

'So Bel has a rose next to her but she can't 'accept' it? What a weird way to do it? Could they have not thought of anything else,' questioned one viewer on Twitter. 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel Ten.
