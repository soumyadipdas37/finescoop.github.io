Former Prime Minister David Cameron wants to add an outdoor swimming pool to his £1.5million family home in the Cotswolds. 

The 53-year-old has applied for planning permission for the 14x4 metre outdoor pool, which plans suggest would be heated.   

If approved, it would be the latest luxury addition to the ex-PM's Cotswold home. 

He caused a stir in 2017 when he installed a shepherd's hut in the garden - a plush upgrade on a garden shed.

Plans submitted to West Oxfordshire District Council suggest he hopes to heat the outdoor pool if it is installed at his £1.5million Cotswold's bolthole

With sheep's-wool insulation and mod cons including dimmer light and classic Bakelite switches, the hand-crafted outbuilding has pride of place in the back garden of Mr Cameron's Oxfordshire home.

Mr Cameron has a wood-burning stove in the hut, which would make it a great place to warm up after a dip in the outdoor pool.

West Oxfordshire District Council has not yet approved the plans, The Sun reports.

Flood risk officials are said to want more details on how the pool will be drained before the plans can progress.  

The shepherd's hut Mr Cameron has in his garden is on black metal wheels, so could be moved alongside the pool to act as a pool house if plans to build it are approved.

He is so fond of his £25,000 luxury bolthole he installed a second one in his family's holiday home in Cornwall after the first one sparked a family fall out.  

The rural home in Oxfordshire is where the former PM hunkered down to write his memoirs, which were published in September last year

He said back in 2017: 'There's been a bit of a fight already – my children want to use it as a wendy house. 

'I want to use it as a book-writing room and my son wants it as an alternative bedroom.' 

The posh shed is where Mr Cameron hunkererd down to write his memoirs, For The Record, which were published in September last year.   

The huts are made by Paul Bennett of Red Sky Shepherd's Huts.

Prices start from £20,000 and rise to £25,000 before optional extras such as stoves, kitchenettes, bathrooms and French doors are added.
