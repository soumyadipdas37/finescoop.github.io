Ariel Winter has been enjoying some quality romantic time with boyfriend Luke Benward during quarantine.

And the former child star appears to be getting serious with the fellow actor, as they prepare to take a big step. 

She kept it casual Sunday in a retro white Black Sabbath T-shirt and some black leggings, as she and Benward went house-hunting in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The 22-year-old completed the look with a colorful printed face mask and a pair of printed white slip-on shoes.

She and Benward, 25, were spotted touring a house with a realtor, who had some paperwork ready to go for them.

Winter and her boyfriend recently wrapped production on their upcoming movie Don't Log Off, which is set in the early days of the COVID-19 lockdown.

Her first project since Modern Family, the comedy-thriller is about a group of friends planning a virtual surprise party, as the birthday girl goes missing.

The Phineas and Ferb star posted to Instagram in late July: 'AND WE ARE WRAPPED!!!!!!! Congratulations and thank you to our whole team— especially the very talented @branbaer & @thethirdlilbaer, our wonderful writers/directors.

'This movie really is an ensemble and I’m honored to be sharing the screen with my friends, and producing this with a few of them as well!!!!!'

She bid farewell to Modern Family back in February, starring as the brainy Alex Dunphy in the ABC sitcom since it premiered in 2009, before coming to an end with its 11th season.  

Winter told Teen Vogue in April: 'This is new territory for me. I was doing something very specific for so long. Now I have to reset my mind and retrain myself to be in that place of, "All right, I am ready to look for the next thing." I am ready to work. I am ready to do everything I can. 

'I am ready to be in the right mindset to go in there again and be able to face the rejection that will come, and be able to move past that and go to the next audition and be ready for it. And be ready for things in my personal life. Just living.'
