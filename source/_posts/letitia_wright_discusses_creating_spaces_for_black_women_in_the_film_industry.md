Letitia Wright has discussed 'creating spaces' in the film industry in a new interview.

Starring in ELLE UK's November issue, the Black Panther star, 26, declared 'we have to be that solid foundation for each other' as she posed in an accompanying cover shoot. 

On there not being enough space carved out for black women historically to succeed, the actress, who is set to depict the hardships of London's West Indian community for Steve McQueen's new series Small Axe, admitted: 'It's sad and it hurts.'

The screen star, who has played major roles in Black Mirror and Avengers: Endgame, went on to share how she stays motivated and lives by a powerful quote by actor Will Smith.

Letitia said: 'But, the funny thing is, if you actually step aside from that mentality and go, no, there's space for all of us [to succeed], we just have to keep building a wall. 

'The bricks at the bottom have to be laid first before the bricks on the second row can be laid. So, if you say, OK, you lay your brick there, and I'll lay my brick in the next two months. 

'Let me make sure that your brick that's laid is good and solid and paid well... Then, soon, you have a wall. Yes, I stole that from Will Smith.

'I've listened to that since I was 16, but he has a point: we have to be bricks, we have to be that solid foundation for each other or else what's the point?'

The media personality rose to worldwide prominence as Shuri in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Black Panther, scooping coveted prizes at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the NAACP Image Awards and the British Academy Film Awards last year.

On being recognised by members of the public, the TV and film star shared: 'As soon as you go to Sainsbury's, you could even be wearing a hat but they're like, 'Yo, I swear that's my girl from Black Panther!'

Letitia's next role will see her transform into Altheia Jones in anthology series Small Axe, which presents five stories of how the West Indian community shaped their own destiny between the 1960s and 1980s, despite the racism and discrimination they faced.

'I keep a very small circle': The thespian also apoke about maintaining a small friendship group with longtime friends John Boyega (pictured) and Damson Idris

The Cucumber star drew parallels between her upcoming show and the Black Lives Matter movement as she told the publication: 'Preparing for it, doing it, giving all that you can to it and then you get to 2020 and you're like, hold up a minute, this is happening again. 

'People aren't going out to protest because they want to. Its aggravation after aggravation and standing up for justice.' 

Elsewhere in the interview, the thespian spoke about maintaining a small friendship group with longtime friends John Boyega and Damson Idris and dealing with the pressures of being a high-profile actress.

The Identity School of Acting alum said: 'I really pride myself on the circle that I keep and it's a very small circle, it's almost like a dot. 

'I remember I asked actor Naomie Harris a few years back for some advice, and she met with me and said, ''How you carry yourself is how people will respond to you.'' So, if I turned up and I have a Gucci bag or [I'm] in the club every day – there's no problem with that, if that's your vibe – but I'm very quiet and all about the work. 

'We're all a family, we all support each other. And – I'm not going to lie – in the UK because we're so small, like, it's such a small pond of actors, we just support each other and love each other.'

The Guava Island star has previously credited her Christian faith for helping her overcome depression.

Recalling a time she saw pop star Justin Bieber while attending a session at megachurch Hillsong in the US, Letitia shared: 'They had a free early morning sermon and my friend was adamant we get there on time. 

'Walking through, seeing Justin Bieber there with his notepad and hoodie on at 9am, I was like, What?'
