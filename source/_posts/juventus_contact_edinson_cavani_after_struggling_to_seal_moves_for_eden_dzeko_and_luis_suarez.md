Juventus have made contact with prolific free agent Edinson Cavani as their search for a new striker this summer takes another twist, according to reports.

The Turin giants are also targeting Barcelona frontman Luis Suarez in a potential swoop and have struggled to haul a deal for experienced Roma ace Edin Dzeko over the line.

Sky Sports Italia claim that Juventus may now move for former Paris Saint-Germain star Cavani, who allowed his contract in the French capital to run down at the end of the campaign.

Juventus have contacted Edinson Cavani as their hunt for a new striker this summer continues

Andrea Pirlo is keen to add an experienced and proven goal scorer to his ranks next season

After the surprising arrival of Andrea Pirlo as Juventus' new head coach, the club have tried desperately to strengthen their frontline before the new Serie A campaign begins.

A swoop for Cavani may prove a shrewd, but ultimately short-term, addition. He had been close to moving to Benfica, but the deal reportedly collapsed due to the experienced hitman's wage demands.

It has been suggested that the Uruguay international wanted a three-year deal worth a hefty £8.8million per season. 

Juventus are attempting to sign Luis Suarez from Barcelona but the deal is still far from over

But Juventus have not been deterred in their bid to add more experience to their ranks. Cavani, just like Suarez, is also 33 years of age and boasted a formidable scoring record in Ligue 1.

The same report highlights that while Suarez would need to negotiate his exit from Barcelona and get an EU passport to not occupy a slot in Juventus' squad, Cavani already holds an Italian passport.

Suarez is understood to have agreed to join Juventus and is gradually nearing the exit door. He must still finalise his payoff though, and will then be able to move to Turin as either a free agent or for a small nominal transfer fee.  

In the event that any move for Suarez falls through, then Cavani could become the back-up option. 

Juventus may yet be left frustrated again, however. Reports in Brazil have touted Cavani to move to Gremio - meaning the Italian outfit might still be active in the market as it edges ever closer to the deadline.

It has also been reported that Roma ace Edin Dzeko is unconvinced about heading to Juventus

Cavani may also be tempted to snub Juventus' advances out of loyalty to his ex-club Napoli

It is also believed that Dzeko is not convinced by the prospect of leaving Roma over the coming weeks, with both Juventus and Inter Milan said to be interested. 

Cavani may still reject Juventus' advances due to his connection with league rivals Napoli. 

He netted 104 goals in 138 matches during his spell in Naples between 2010 and 2013, and also helped the club lift the Coppa Italia during his first season. 

This loyalty and affection for his former club could scupper any move to the Allianz Stadium.
