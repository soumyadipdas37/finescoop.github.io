Bachelor in Paradise star Brittney Weldon recently underwent a stunning post-show transformation. 

And the 26-year-old even left her fans baffled when she shared a selfie alongside Renee Barrett and another gal pal in Darwin over the weekend. 

'Which one is Brittany [sic]?' one of her followers asked, with the comment 'liked' eight times.

Two more fans pointed out how different the reality star looked in comparison to her time on the Channel 10 show, earlier this year. 

'Wow you look so different Brittney. I love your hair colour,' another wrote. 

While one commented: 'U look so different Britt.' 





Baffled: Fans couldn't help but comment about how different she looked 

Brittney's face appears squarer and her cheeks fuller in the photograph. 

The natural-born brunette also showed off her new blonde tresses, which were curled for the group photo with the girls. 

The reality star wore a full face of glossy make-up, along with a matte lipstick.

Taking a walk on the lighter side! Brittney also flaunted her transformation in a candid selfie last Tuesday. In the image, the reality star styled her newly blonde hair in loose curls while snapping a selfie from above. She is pictured before, left, and after, right

A cosmetic clinic praised Brittney as 'gorgeous', and she responded: 'LOVING my lips.' This appears to be the first time she has disclosed having lip filler.    

It comes after Brittney confirmed she was no longer dating her Paradise co-star Jackson Garlick, whom she left Fiji with to pursue a romance in the outside world. 

She told her Instagram followers last month: 'I'm here for my final update: @jacksongarlick and I aren't together, but he is an amazing guy.

Blonde bombshell! Brittney seems to be loving her glamorous new look

'We did catch up on the outside, I did meet his friends and family, and we had good times. Unfortunately, life gets in the way, and we are now just friends. I am so happy that I had this experience and wouldn't change anything.'

Brittney made her Bachelor debut on season six in 2018, before appearing on season two of Paradise in 2019 and the third season the following year.

Despite making three appearances in the franchise, she is yet to find lasting love.
