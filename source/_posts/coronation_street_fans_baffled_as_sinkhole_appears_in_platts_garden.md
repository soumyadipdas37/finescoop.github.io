Meanwhile, soap expert Sarah Marshall previously teased that the sinkhole drama is set to be part of a bigger storyline for the Platts.

She said on This Morning earlier this month: 'It initially means that the Platts are homeless - there's always something going on there, there's always bodies being buried there.

'I can't help thinking that if you're going to go to the trouble of making a massive sinkhole, is this going to be part of a bigger storyline? And that's what I'm hearing, possibly a big storyline coming up.'
