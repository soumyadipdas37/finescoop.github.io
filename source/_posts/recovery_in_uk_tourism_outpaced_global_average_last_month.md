But there are fears that the UK's recovery could stall this month, amid fears of a second wave, the new 'rule of six' and the end of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme which boosted restaurants in August. 

Jeavon Lolay, from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: 'Other European countries have already experienced a slowdown as they navigate further outbreaks of Covid-19 and additional measures to stop the pandemic's spread.'
