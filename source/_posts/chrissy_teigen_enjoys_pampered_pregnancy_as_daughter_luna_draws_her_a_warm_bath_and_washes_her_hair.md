Chrissy Teigen is on mandatory bed rest, as she prepares to welcome her third child with EGOT-winner husband John Legend.

And the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model is enjoying a pampered pregnancy, thanks to her first child. 

She posted a cute photo Sunday to Instagram of daughter Luna washing her hair, as she soaked in a warm bath, which her thoughtful baby girl prepared for her.

It comes after she accidentally revealed the sex of their new baby to her 31.2million followers Thursday in an Instagram Story.

Chrissy said while opening up about the complications that required her bed rest: 'It's so weird because the baby's really really healthy. He's big. He’s probably, oops! That was stupid.'

She covered her mouth when she realized what she said, writing with the video: 'hahahahaha might as well tell you'

It's a boy! Chrissy said while opening up about the complications that required her bed rest: 'It's so weird because the baby's really really healthy. He's big. He’s probably, oops! That was stupid'

The Lip Sync Battle host shares daughter Luna Simone, four, and son Miles Theodore, two, with husband John Legend, 41, whom she married in 2013.

She also opened up on Insta about her health complications with her previous pregnancies, revealing: 'My placenta sucks.'

Chrissy continued: 'It’s always been kind of the bad part of my pregnancies with Luna. With Miles, it just stopped feeding him. It stopped taking care of him.

Bed rest: But she remained optimistic about her new addition: 'We just have to get my placenta healthy again, and that means not moving so I’m on complete and total "don’t get out except to pee-pee" bed rest'

'I was stealing all his food because I was getting huge but he wasn’t getting big at all, so he had to come out early and Luna had to come out early. I was induced both times.'

But she remained optimistic about her new addition: 'Everything’s good. I’m feeling really good, but my placenta’s really, really weak and it’s causing me to really bleed a lot. So basically, it’s just pretty high risk.

'This poor thing has been through so much already. We just have to get my placenta healthy again, and that means not moving so I’m on complete and total "don’t get out except to pee-pee" bed rest.'
