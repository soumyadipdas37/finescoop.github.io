Dancing With The Stars judge Tristan MacManus was announced as Sarah Harris' new co-host on Studio 10 just last week.

And in a first-look trailer for the revamped morning talk show, the professional dancer's camaraderie with Harris, 39, is evident.

In the clip, Harris squeals with delight as she finds out MacManus, 38, has been chosen to replace Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling as her co-host.

All but showing his face, the video teases MacManus getting suited and booted as he makes his way to the Channel 10 studio to begin work.

An unsuspecting Sarah is seen getting final touches by her hair and make-up team before Tristan walks up from behind and says: 'Hello, Ms Harris!'

Turning around to see Tristan, the broadcaster lets out an excitable scream and rushes to hug him.

Proving they hit it off straight away, the Irish star shows off his dance moves as he swirls Sarah.

Tristan is set to make his hotly anticipated debut on the Studio 10 on Monday.

Tristan said of his new role in an official statement: 'Although people know me as a dancer, I think my mouth usually works better than my feet do.

'This opportunity came out of the blue, and I'm really excited to be working with Sarah and learning from her,' the father-of-two continued.

It comes after regular Studio 10 panellists Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling were axed from the network last month.

Tristan and Sarah will be joined by news reporter Narelda Jacobs, entertainment reporter Angela Bishop, and contributors Denise Drysdale, Jono Coleman and Craig Bennett.

On Thursday morning, Joe Hildebrand announced his decision to leave the show after discussing his future with the network for a month.
