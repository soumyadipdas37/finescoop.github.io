A petition is gaining traction demanding Nancy Pelosi be prosecuted for 'COVID violations' after she was seen in a hair salon without a mask last week. 

At least 16,000 people have signed the petition with a 20,000 signature goal urging San Francisco Police Chief William Scott to prosecute the Speaker of the House.  

The petition includes a letter addressed to the police chief that says, 'Laws aren't just for the ''little people.'''

'Not only did Nancy Pelosi knowingly violate health ordinances, but just destroyed a business because she couldn't take a ounce of responsibility. 

'At a very minimum, Nancy Pelosi must be prosecuted by San Francisco for her flaunting of COVID regulations. Now!'

'The ''mainstream'' media pretends to be unbiased referees while they operate as an arm of the Democrat party. As long as they're still faking objectivity, we'll be there to remind them,' the site says.  

The site was founded by Ken LaCorte, a mentee of the late Fox News boss Roger Ailes who worked as an executive at the network for two decades.  

'Join our campaigns to expose the left, protect their victims and replace the liberal media complex,' LaCorte says on the site. 

Salon SF, found in the affluent Cow Hollow neighborhood, became the subject of headlines after Pelosi was seen flouting pandemic health guidelines inside the business.

Pelosi argued that she was 'set up' by the owner, but the salon has since denied those claims and called them 'absolutely false.'

The petition states, 'The salon owner gets death threats, while Pelosi has paid ZERO price for her hypocrisy.'

Erica Kious, the owner of eSalon SF, said she was forced to shutter her business after she received threats in the wake of exposing Pelosi's trip to the salon. 

After footage of the Democrat's trip went viral a day later, Kious told Tucker Carlson that her business was 'done'. But a GoFundMe page set up in wake of the scandal reached its target of $300,000.

 Pelosi said she had been to the salon several times over the years and was 'set up.'

'I take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighborhood salon I've been to over the years many times, and when they said we're able to accommodate people, one person at a time, and that we can set up that time, I trusted that. As it turns out, it was a setup,' she said.

'It was a set up, and I take responsibility for falling for a setup,' she added.  

Many have deemed Pelosi a hypocrite for flouting face mask guidelines after criticizing Trump for not wearing one.  

When he was pictured in one in July she said: 'He's crossed a bridge. So hopefully by his example, he will change his attitude, which will be helpful in stopping the spread of the coronavirus.'

In July Pelosi announced that all members will be required to wear a mask when voting on the House floor. She said failure to wear would be 'serious breach of decorum' for which members could be removed from the chamber.

'It's a sign of respect for the health, safety and well-being of others present in the chamber and in surrounding areas,' she added.  

 

Meanwhile, Trump spewed attacks against Pelosi on Twitter, where he questioned how'd she fare in global negotiations given claims the incident was a 'set up.' 

'Nancy Pelosi said she got 'set up' by the owner (a very good one) of a beauty parlor,' Trump wrote.

'If so, how will she do in negotiations against President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, or Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Not so well, I suspect, but far better than Joe Hiden' would do!'    

Trump is just one of several Republicans who have leveraged Pelosi's controversy as a criticism against Democrats ahead of the November election.
