Sam, who owns a successful online fitness program and multiple gyms, however admitted that he feels 'incredibly grateful to have a job when so many people are doing it so tough.'  

The doting father also said  he feels 'lucky' his family has remained healthy throughout the pandemic, especially since he suffered his own COVID-19 health scare recently.  

'A few months back, I was feeling a little under the weather so I did the right thing and got tested, but it came back negative,' he revealed.  

Life in lockdown: Sam is currently self-isolating with his wife, Snezana Markoski, 39, and their three children, Charlie, one, Willow, two, and 14-year-old Eve - Snezana's daughter from a previous relationship

Like many people stuck in Melbourne during stage-four lockdown, Sam has been sporting a very relaxed look in recent weeks.

Last Wednesday, the hunk showed off the disastrous results of an at-home haircut by Snezana on Instagram, comparing his new look to that of an 'Oompa Loompa'. 

Phew: Sam said he did 'the right thing' by taking a COVID-19 test a few months ago, and  that thankfully the test came back negative  

'Hi, my name is Bob. I let my wife give me a Covid cut,' Sam wrote alongside a photo of himself.   

Sam's shoulder length hair was cut to just below his ears, causing his 'do to fall in ringlets. 

His unfortunate 'do was accompanied by a salt-and-pepper beard and moustache.
