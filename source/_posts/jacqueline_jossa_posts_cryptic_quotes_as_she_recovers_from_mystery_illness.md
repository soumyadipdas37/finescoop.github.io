Jacqueline Jossa was in a philosophical mood on Sunday as she shared two cryptic motivational quotes on her Instagram.

Taking to Stories, the mum of two shared the quote: 'Don't feel bad if people only remember you when they need you.

'Feel privileged that you are like a candle that comes to their mind when they are in the dark.'

The I'm A Celebrity champion went on to share another message from US self-help author Wayne Dyer, which read: 'Remind yourself that you cannot fail at being yourself.' 

The quotes come just days after Jacqueline, 27, was bedridden with a mystery illness, telling her fans that she was trying to take it easy.   

'I had a brilliant day yesterday but... last night come over unwell - not corona - sick,' she explained. 'So I'm just in bed trying to recover.'

The star has been feeling better over the weekend though as she spent time with her family, husband Dan Osborne and their daughters Ella, five, and Mia, two.

Jacqueline and Dan have looked happier than ever recently after defending their marriage in recent weeks, celebrating their youngest daughter's second birthday and taking a family holiday to Greece.

Earlier this month Jacqueline took to Instagram to make another public statement about her marriage to Dan. 

Sharing a loved-up snap of them laughing together, the star captioned the image with the words: 'No one needs to understand but us.'   

The couple have had their share of ups and downs with allegations of cheating on Dan's part since they married in 2017.

Dan later admitted he had in fact been unfaithful to Jacqueline and that she had forgiven him for his past indiscretions.  

The reality star also let rip on social media about his marriage in a foul-mouthed rant after a fan questioned why Jacqueline stays with him.   

He wrote: 'Because we love each other, have a beautiful family, I'm a good husband, good dad to our kids, we get on well, laugh together, super attracted to each other…

'Any more reasons you need? You didn't know none of that, eh? That's because you do not f***ing know me, or my wife, or us as a couple lol.

'So concentrate on your own life and you (sic) clearly never been taught to not be rude, especially to people you don't even know. Hope you've learnt something from this.'

The response stemmed from a post Jacqueline shared the previous day of herself and husband Dan, urging him to 'hurry home please' amid his Turkey trip.
