Looking caliente! Salma Hayek shared a new swimsuit photo to Instagram on Tuesday as she said the image was not a flashback. And the wife of billionaire François-Henri Pinault added that the next day she would be turning 54-years-old

A pinup always: The Friday actress does not seem to age as she continues to be wrinkle free with a slender figure. Seen in the 1996 film From Dusk Till Dawn

The siren had on a halter black swimsuit with a wrap around her waist as she added sunglasses and a hat.

'Guess who’s turning 54 tomorrow? By the way, this is not a Throwback Thursday! Thank you Marjo for turning into a photographer during the vacation!' said the Wild West actress in her caption as she noted she is a Virgo.

Her longtime friend Penelope Cruz hit 'like.'

Last month the Like A Boss star was seen in a skimpy two piece in black as she sipped coffee al fresco by a tiled wall in Greece.

Salma styled her brunette locks into a sweptback relaxed bun and went makeup-free as she displayed her radiant complexion. 

The actress, who wore a pair of black sunglasses, playfully posed with a cup of coffee for the snap. 

It comes after Salma posted a loved-up snap with her husband François-Henri, 58, to Instagram.

In the photo, the couple shared a cheeky kiss while both fully masked up amid the Covid-19 crisis.

'Love in the time of corona El amor en los tiempos de corona. #love,' the 53-year-old star wrote alongside the picture of herself and her husband. 

Salma and her French businessman husband have been married since 2009, after tying the knot in a lavish Paris ceremony on Valentine's Day. Their nuptials are said to have cost an eye-watering $3.5 million.

Their big day took place in the famous Venice opera house Teatro La Fenice, and the lovers were joined by an A-List group of well wishers, including Penelope Cruz, Woody Harrelson and Bono.  

Last year, it was reported that François-Henri is worth an estimated $33.2billion. (He is the chairman and CEO of Kering since 2005, and president of Groupe Artémis since 2003.)

The Oscar-nominated actress remains tight-lipped about their relationship, but last year she did address trolls who apparently criticized the union.

'A lot of people are very shocked that I married who I married,' she said in an interview with Town & Country. 

'And some people are even intimidated now by me. But it's another way of showing racism. They can't believe this Mexican ended up in the life that she has, and they're uncomfortable around me.'

Salma added: '[Pinault] is the best husband in the world. I get to be who I am with him, and I don't feel that somebody tries to limit me.'
