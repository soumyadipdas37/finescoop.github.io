Memory lane: 'I really was born at 9:29am on nine twenty- nine. You think I'm lying but I'm being dead serious. Okay, I'll prove it,' narrates Halsey, who filled the video with footage from her childhood

The camera then pans over a pink-lit room that features a rocking horse, a baby's crib, stacks of books, and various other furnishings throughout it.

A video of Halsey's family photos being tossed into a pile is then projected on top of the items in the little girl's bedroom before the video, itself, overtakes the screen.  

The audience is first treated to video footage of a much younger Halsey, born Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, posing on the porch of her house in a white baptism dress, before launching into a full on montage. 

At one point, young Halsey can be seen excitedly digging into a piece of cake, while another video shows baby Halsey pushing a baby stroller through her crowded living room.
