She's an Oscar winner about to appear in a reboot of a beloved children's fantasy film, in a timeless role made famous by Anjelica Huston. 

 The Witches star Anne Hathaway was spotted near the beach in Connecticut on Sunday, in a casual getup as she carted a bunch of baskets and towels on her own.

Hathaway, 37, donned a floppy straw hat, oversized blue beach shirt and colorful sandals for the outing.

The Les Miserables actress hid her eyes behind large sunshades as she ambled along. 

The mother-of-two is set to appear in Robert Zemeckis's The Witches this October – a remake of the classic 1990 film by Nicolas Roeg, which itself was an adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's story. 

Hathaway will be playing the role of the Grand High Witch, a fabulously sexy and seductive woman who deep down is a hideous hag whose primary desire is to murder children.

The role was brought to life with aplomb by Huston, also an Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner, in the 1990 original film, and to this day remains one of her trademark roles. 

The new film will also star Anne's Devil Wears Prada co-star Stanley Tucci, along with Octavia Spencer as the grandmother who ultimately saves the day along with her grandson.

Chris Rock is also slated to appear in the new iteration of the film, the poster for which is now visible on IMDb.com.
