Manchester United legendÂ Patrice Evra turned his hand to non-league football at the weekend.

The five-time Premier League winner played at left back for Brentham FC, who ply their trade in the 11th tier of English football in the Middlesex County League, on Saturday.

The 39-year-old, who officially retired last summer following a trophy-laden career, could not help the side avoid defeat as they were beaten 3-2 byÂ North Greenford United.

Footage of the former France international surfaced on social media and Evra showed that he has lost none of his skill.

Evra, in the No 11 shirt, took a throw-in down the left flank and after receiving the ball back from his team-mate played a back-heel pass.

'Thanks for letting me playing with you guys .. such a good day, don't worry Giggsy I honoured your number the best I could,' Evra wrote on Twitter.

It appears that Evra was keen to get some minutes under his belt ahead of Soccer Aid match

The ex-United full back will return to Old Trafford next month as he's in the World XI to face England in the charity football match Soccer Aid.

It appears that Evra was keen to get some minutes under his belt ahead of the clash on September 6.

The Twitter account of Brentham wrote: 'It was a real privilege to have @Evra train and play for us. He needed some minutes ahead of the @socceraid Socceraidcharity match for @UNICEF taking place at @ManUtd Old Trafford next month.'

Evra, who became a football television pundit after hanging up his boots, is widely regarded as one of the best left backs to ever grace the Premier League after a successful eight-year spell at United.Â
