Downing Street has denied an Italian newspaper's claim that Boris Johnson enjoyed a secret jaunt to Perugia last weekend as Brexit and coronavirus gripped the UK.

La Repubblica cites an official statement from the Umbrian airport dated September 17 which says that Mr Johnson travelled through 'in the last few day.'

A source from San Francesco d'Assisi airport told the newspaper that the Prime Minister landed on Friday, September 11 at 2pm.

Number 10 told the Italian daily: 'This claim is wrong.'

On that Friday, Mr Johnson was faced with MPs preparing to rebel on his international law-breaking Brexit deal and rising numbers of coronavirus infections across the UK.

Mr Johnson has reportedly travelled to the airport before to visit his friend Evgeny Lebedev, owner of the Evening Standard, at his medieval castle.

Russian-born Mr Lebedev, whose father is a former KGB operative, is known for hosting lavish parties for his celebrity friends at the Castello di Santa Eurasia.

According to one report Mr Johnson worked from Downing Street on the day in question and took part in a Zoom call with 256 Tory MPs on Brexit.

Mr Johnson had tried to give a patriotic rallying cry to encourage his colleagues to back his controversial plans for the UK's withdrawal from the EU.

One source said that Mr Johnson's connection had cut out during the call and when he came back on he joked that he should probably invest in superfast internet, Politics Home reported.

Last year it was reported that Mr Johnson, during his time as Foreign Secretary, had been spotted at Perugia's airport looking dishevelled 'in last night's clothes.'

A fellow passenger told The Guardian that Mr Johnson appeared to be stumbling around and at one point looked as if he might vomit.

There was silence from Mr Johnson's communications staff when those reports emerged last year.
