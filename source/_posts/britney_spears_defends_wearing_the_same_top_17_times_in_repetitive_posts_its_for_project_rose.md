Grammy winner Britney Spears might not be in complete control over her estate and finances, but she defended the reason she repeatedly wears the same peasant-style blouses on Instagram.

'A lot of people have been saying that a lot of my posts are not new but they're old. But just to let you guys know, none of my pictures or posts are more than a month old,' the 38-year-old pop star explained on Tuesday.

'Yes, I know. I did wear the same top 17 times, but it's for a project - Project Rose. And you will be seeing way more of Project Rose in the future.'

Britney previously referred to Project Rose as the 'Just a Touch of Rose' shoot in an August 21 post.

Since March 25, Spears has shared 17 depictions of the fragrant flower as well as countless rose emojis embedded in her captions.

'Some say they smell the fragrance of roses while communicating with angels in prayer or meditation. Did you know? I didn't either!' the Mississippi-born blonde wrote on July 21.

'Angels use rose scents as signs of their spiritual presence because roses have energy fields that vibrate at a high electrical frequency - the highest of any flower on Earth! Pssss ... in other words buy some damn roses!'     

Britney added: 'Yes, I know. I did wear the same top 17 times, but it's for a project - Project Rose. And you will be seeing way more of Project Rose in the future'

Spears custodial rights went from 50–50 to 70-30 in 2019 with ex-husband Kevin Federline shortly after her 30-day stint at an 'all-encompassing wellness facility' ended, according to TMZ.

The former Mouseketeer backed the Free Britney movement in new court documents filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court on August 19.

Britney also requested that Bessemer Trust Company, N.A. be appointed to the role of conservator rather than her father Jamie.

Spears' permanent conservatorship - which stemmed from her being put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold in 2008 - remained unchanged and was extended through February 2021.
