Mark Thibault, 56, from Florida, has been charged with second-degree murder for allegedly stabbing to death his wife, Rachel, with a sword during an argument 

A Florida man has been arrested for murder after police say he confessed to stabbing his wife to death with a sword during an argument. 

When officers responded to the scene in the 500 block of Southeast 21 Lane in Homestead on Tuesday evening, they were met by 53-year-old Mark Thibault, who, unprompted, told them: 'I had a horrible night. I’ve been in a fight with someone who I thought was my wife,' according to officials.  

He then directed the officers to his wife's body laying in a hallway inside a mattress bag. 

Rachel was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.40pm, as Local10 first reported. Police recovered a handgun at the house, but they said the murder weapon was a sword. 

The incident began unfolding when police received a call from Mark's relative in Tallahassee, who told them that the man had reached out to him and confessed to killing his wife, 53-year-old Rachel Thibault. 

The family member told investigators that Thibault had told him that he and Rachel had gotten into a verbal argument, which lasts several hours and escalated to a physical altercation.

During the fight, the husband allegedly struck his wife's head against a bathtub and stabbed her with a sword. 

When questioned by police, Mark allegedly admitted to the killing. Univision reported that the suspect told detectives that at one point during his hours-long argument with Rachel, she took on the appearance of a demon, so he bashed her head against the tub and stabbed her multiple times.  

Mark was booked into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on a charge of second-degree murder with a deadly weapon. He is being held without bond. 

Univision reported that the Thibault couple have a grown daughter together.
