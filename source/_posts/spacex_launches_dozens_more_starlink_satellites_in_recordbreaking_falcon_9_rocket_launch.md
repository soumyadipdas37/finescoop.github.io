SpaceX celebrated its 100th successful launch Tuesday morning, sending 58 Starlink satellites into orbit aboard the Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral.

Along with the internet beaming devices were three SkySat observational satellites owned by Planet Labs, a private Earth-imaging company. 

Falcon 9 is the first reusable rocket designed to take cargo and passengers into orbit, and today's rocket was flying for a record sixth time.

Today's launch marked SpaceX's 92nd Falcon mission. 

It is the second for Starlink this month and the 11th since the program began in May 2019.

There are now 600 Starlink satellites in orbit - part of  SpaceX's plan for a global high-speed internet service.

The Falcon 9 has completed 92 missions altogether, according to SpaceX. Scorch marks from previous flights were still visible at takeoff

The Falcon 9 blasted off at at 10:30am EDT from Florida's Cape Canaveral.

A backup launch date had been scheduled for Wednesday in case of inclement weather.

The booster rocket, designated B1049, dropped off eight minutes after takeoff. It then rendezvoused with SpaceX's Of Course I Still Love You floating drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. 

Two smaller drone ships, Ms. Chief and Ms. Tree, were deployed to recover Falcon 9's two-part nose cone. 

The payload launched shortly after 10:30 am EDT aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9, the first reusable rocket designed to take cargo and passengers into orbit and beyond. A backup launch had been scheduled for Wednesday if the weather was inclement

SpaceX celebrated its 100th successful launch Tuesday morning, sending 58 Starlink satellites into space from Cape Canaveral. They will join more than 600 others already in orbit to form a global high-speed internet service

Ms. Tree caught one half in its net, SpaceX reported, though the other half could still be recovered.

Deployed all at once, the 58 Starlink satellites will now slowly disburse and join the more than 600 others already in orbit. 

Initial internet service using the network in the United States and Canada is expected later this year, CBS reports.

After astronomers complained the satellites were reflecting sunlight and interfering with their observations, SpaceX added a 'sunshade' to mitigate their impact. 

Also onboard the rocket were three of Planet's SkySat satellites, which join three others the company sent into space aboard the  Falcon 9 in June.

In a blog post last week, Planet Labs VP Mike Safyan said taking advantage of SpaceX's 'rideshare' program' allowed the company to get its satellites in the air much faster than a dedicated launch would have.

And splitting the payloads over two launches meant getting them into position faster, Sayfan added, 'which results in Planet's customers benefiting from these enhanced products much sooner than any other provider can offer.'

SpaceX's next big mission will be launching the SAOCOM-1B satellite for Argentina's space program, slated for late August at the earliest.

It will be the first launch to utilize the polar launch corridor since 1960, according to NASA.

More Starlink launches are expected, along with the launch of the SXM-7 and GPS-III-SV04 satellites and the first operational mission for Crew Dragon, tentatively slated for on or after October 23.

This summer a small number of people who expressed an interest in trying the Starlink broadband service are expected to be given access to the network.

 The firm estimates it will need at least 800 satellites to offer a full service, but now with the new batch, the amount has increased enough to start beaming a signal down to customers on Earth.

The company are currently going through the 'regulatory' process that includes applying for a telecom licence in Canada allowing it to provide commercial services.

SpaceX plans to launch at least 2,200 satellites over the next five years in order to offer a global broadband service covering even the most remote areas of the world.

Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched the fifth batch of its 'Starlink' space internet satellites - taking the total to 300.

They form a constellation of thousands of satellites, designed to provide low-cost broadband internet service from low Earth orbit.

The constellation, informally known as Starlink, and under development at SpaceX's facilities in Redmond, Washington.

Its goal is to beam superfast internet into your home from space.

While satellite internet has been around for a while, it has suffered from high latency and unreliable connections.

Starlink is different. SpaceX says putting a 'constellation' of satellites in low earth orbit would provide high-speed, cable-like internet all over the world.

The billionaire's company wants to create the global system to help it generate more cash.

Musk has previously said the venture could give three billion people who currently do not have access to the internet a cheap way of getting online.

It could also help fund a future city on Mars.

Helping humanity reach the red planet is one of Musk's long-stated aims and was what inspired him to start SpaceX.

The company recently filed plans with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch 4,425 satellites into orbit above the Earth - three times as many that are currently in operation.

'Once fully deployed, the SpaceX system will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth's surface and therefore, in principle, have the ability to provide ubiquitous global service,' the firm said.

'Every point on the Earth's surface will see, at all times, a SpaceX satellite.'

The network will provide internet access to the US and the rest of the world, it added.

It is expected to take more than five years and $9.8 billion (£7.1bn) of investment, although satellite internet has proved an expensive market in the past and analysts expect the final bill will be higher.

Musk compared the project to 'rebuilding the internet in space', as it would reduce reliance on the existing network of undersea fibre-optic cables which criss-cross the planet.

In the US, the FCC welcomed the scheme as a way to provide internet connections to more people.
