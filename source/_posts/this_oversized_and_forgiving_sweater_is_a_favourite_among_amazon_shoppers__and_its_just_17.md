From floaty blouses to blanket hoodies, oversized silhouettes are becoming increasingly popular on Amazon.

There are thousands of jumpers currently available on the mega-site, but there's one item in particular that's piquing the interest of shoppers. Enter the ZANZEA Women's Sweater. It's the next big thing - literally.

Thanks to its easy, relaxed and food-baby friendly fit, the sweater has amassed nearly 2,000 reviews and become the number one bestseller in Amazon's Women's Jumpers category. It's described as 'extremely comfortable,' and 'versatile' by customers, who've declared their love for its 'loose' yet 'flattering' fit.

It features a crew neck, long batwing arms that accentuate the roomy fit, and a round hem that's slightly longer at the back. 

The oversized but flattering piece from ZANZEA comes in a whopping 30 colours from classic black to autumnal shades such as rust red, mustard yellow and olive green. And it costs a very reasonable £16.99.

'It's light but well made- perfect for adding a little warmth, or for full-on double layering,' one reviewer wrote. 'It looks stylish and I've had great compliments on the beautiful colour (I went with the dark red.)

'The fabric is soft and relaxed knit- it drapes nicely, vs others I've tried that were stiff and scratchy. Overall I'm pleased with this top - I'm here looking at more colors!'

Another shopper commented: 'Lovely top. Soft. Extremely comfortable. I did buy a size up as many clothes bought online tend to come up way to tight, but this top was lovely and baggy.

Washed very well and tumble dried well too. I'm after another one now in a different colour.'

Effortless stylish the bestselling sweater can be dressed up or down for day-to-evening styling - just add your favourite skinnies and heels. And it's also easy to layer on top of a vest.

A third shopper wrote: 'I now have 10 of these in different colours, absolutely adore them and wear them with skinny jeans or leggings.

'If it gets really cold, just put a vest underneath. They have travelled the world with me. Great purchase'
