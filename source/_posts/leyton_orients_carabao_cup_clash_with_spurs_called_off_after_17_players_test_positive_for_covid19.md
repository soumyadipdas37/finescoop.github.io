Leyton Orient failed in a desperate attempt to get their Carabao Cup match against Tottenham played on Tuesday night after the Covid-19 outbreak at the club.

Orient spent the day trying to convince the EFL that the game could go ahead at their Breyer Group Stadium, but the plug was pulled just two hours before the scheduled kick-off after 17 players from the League Two club tested positive.

Orient’s determination to play the game stemmed partly from the fact it was due to be televised by Sky Sports, earning them £150,000, and they are adamant the game should be played at a later date.

Leyton Orient's EFL Cup third-round tie with Tottenham was called off hours before kick-off

Not fulfilling the fixture on Tuesday night leaves Orient in breach of EFL rules, so Tottenham should be handed a bye to the next round.

However, the governing body fell short of confirming Tottenham’s passage in their statement on Tuesday — causing a degree of consternation at the north London club.

Spurs are in the midst of a draining schedule and a rearrangement of the game would cause huge issues for them.

The League Two club were set to take on Spurs in an EFL Cup third-round game on Tuesday

5.1 A Club which is unable to fulfil its obligation to complete a Competition match in Round One to (and including) Round Four due to either:

5.1.1 that Club's Player(s) having returned a positive CAT result and self-isolating in accordance with the action plan set out in the Return to Play/Return to Training Protocols resulting in the Club not having a sufficient number of Players to fulfil the fixture; or

5.1.2 any requirements or directions of the UK Government and/or by any public authority,

shall forfeit the fixture, pay the opposing Club's expenses in accordance with Rule 5.8 and the opposing team shall receive a bye into the next round of the Competition.

Defiant Orient owner Nigel Travis told talkSPORT on Tuesday night: ‘As far as we’re concerned the game is a postponement, not a cancellation. I recognise that is in the guidelines (about the rule breach). 

‘We have talked to the league about extenuating circumstances. I can assure you we will not be the first club this happens to this year.

‘The net result is we expect this game to be replayed, we expect it to take place, given flexibility. We will certainly campaign very strongly to make sure that it does take place.’

Despite Travis’s hopes, his club are set to be kicked out, with the EFL merely waiting for all the paperwork from Public Health England before confirming Orient’s stadium and training facility have been shut down owing to the outbreak and ratifying their decision.

In fact, the EFL had fully intended to disqualify Orient from the competition on Tuesday morning, but fell short of doing so following a day of discussions.

It was Spurs who paid for Orient’s players to be tested following a loosening of procedures at League Two level.

The 17 positive tests may affect last Saturday’s opponents Mansfield and this Saturday’s game against Walsall.

The positive tests have also impacted Sky Sports, who had to enact their own Covid procedures after Orient skipper Jobi McAnuff appeared as a guest pundit last Friday night for the Championship match between Coventry and Queens Park Rangers.

Sky Sports have stringent Covid procedures in place to ensure their staff are protected and the spate of positive tests at Orient triggered those protocols — which include a track and trace system. Guest pundits are required to fill in Covid forms before entering the studio, something with which McAnuff complied fully.

Sportsmail can also reveal that the 38-year-old took it upon himself to drive to Sky’s studios during the pandemic and turned down the transport provided by the broadcaster to minimise contact with others.

Spurs boss Jose Mourinho was planning to rest Harry Kane for the Orient game, as he prioritises Thursday’s Europa League qualifier against Shkendija Tetovo in Macedonia.
