Australian actor Hugh Jackman and his wife Deborra-Lee Furness were spotted enjoying a light stroll in New York on Tuesday.

The couple wore face masks as they walked their two pet pooches around Soho - a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan.

Hugh, 51, and Deborra-lee, 64, both cut casual figures as they took in the fresh air and incredible views.

The couple and their adopted children Ava, 14, and Oscar, 20, only returned to New York in recent days from their stunning holiday home in The Hamptons. 

Hugh and Deborra-lee, who own an apartment nearby in New York, appeared to be walking nearby two of Hugh's established Laughing Man Coffee cafes.

While dine in is still not an option in New York for his businesses, the popular cafes have remained open for takeaway.

While Deborra-lee opted for her usual all-black ensemble, she added to her look with white sneakers and a quirky Panda-print mask. 

During their light stroll, the couple were joined by their two adorable dogs, Allegra and Dali.  

Hugh, a responsible pet owner, carried a green plastic bag to clean up after his canines on the walk.

In July, The Greatest Showman actor revealed he was homesick for Australia, after a lengthy lockdown in New York City due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Deborra-lee and the couple's children, Oscar and Ava, had initially been in Melbourne when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March.

But they returned to the U.S. just four days later in order to keep the family together.

Later this month, Hugh is due to virtually attend the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

He is one of five nominees up for an Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Limited TV series or Movie for his role as Frank Tassone in Bad Education.  

'I'm humbled by the nominations for both me and the film and excited to be named with such a talented group of actors,' Hugh said in a statement at the time. 

Due to the global health crisis, the Emmy Awards will be a bit different this year.

Jimmy Kimmel will host the show from a stage inside California's Staples Center, which will have no red carpet or audience, Variety reported last month.
