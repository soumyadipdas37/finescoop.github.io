On the previous night she went full-on glam as she celebrated the launch of her brand new tanning range with BPerfect.

And Jacqueline Jossa was distinctly fresh-faced as she took to Instagram on Thursday morning while cosying up to husband Dan Osborne during a day out in Belfast. 

The former EastEnders star, 27, showcased her make-up free visage as she leaned in close for her former TOWIE star beau, 27, for the sweet snap.

Jacqueline beamed with happiness in the snap, which saw her don a white T-shirt beneath a monochrome coat.

She swept her brunette tresses into a bun for the day, while she let her natural beauty shine through by ditching the cosmetics.

Meanwhile, Dan flashed dazzling smile as he posed alongside his wife of three years.

Captioning the snap, Jacqueline wrote: 'Time well spent my love'.

On Sunday, Jacqueline proudly flaunted her physique in a brown bikini as she promoted her new tanning range in a sizzling Instagram snap.

Jacqueline showed off her curves in the busty brown bikini top and matching bottoms as she shared a snap from latest shoot. 

The actress posed up a storm to promote her BPerfect tanning range as she counted down to the launch of her new collection. 

Back in July, Jacqueline revealed that she finally 'doesn't care' about being a size 12 to 14 as she opened about her journey to finding body positivity in an honest video.

Jacqueline said she has finally accepted her curves, but didn't rule out the idea of hitting the gym.  

She thanked fans for the support she received since sharing the unedited images of herself in Ibiza, admitting that she wrestled with the decision as to whether she should post them, but after doing so, she felt like a weight had been lifted. 

In the caption for her unedited bikini photos shared earlier that week in the summer, Jacqueline wrote: 'It's taken a while but I've learnt to love both angles.  

'You guys know me by now and I'm as normal as they come. I'm a working mum and a size 12 and I can't walk around looking perfect all the time and I've accepted that's completely fine.

'So this is just a little reminder to all us women that EVERY body is a bikini body and the perfect instagram pics we see isn't always the reality, sometimes it's just good lighting and good angles!'

Jacqueline divulged that she had previously turned down work because she felt uncomfortable being photographed in a bikini.

She said: 'I also had turned down the chance to do a swimwear range with @inthestyle earlier this year as perhaps wasn't comfortable shooting it.... 

'But I changed my mind & decided I wanted to create something I was comfortable with and only wanted to shoot it if we could keep it real and honest.'
