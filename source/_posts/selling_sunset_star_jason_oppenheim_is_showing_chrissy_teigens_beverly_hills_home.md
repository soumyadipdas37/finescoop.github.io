Selling Sunset star Jason Oppenheim is trying to make a believer out of Chrissy Teigen by selling her $24 million Beverly Hills home.

Oppenheim, 43, the owner/co-founder of The Oppenheim Group featured on Netflix's Selling Sunset, tweeted to the 34-year-old Teigen, 'If you want to see if I’m real, I’ll be showing your house tomorrow morning to one of my clients.'

While Teigen did not respond to  the tweet, and it's unsure if she actually came to the showing on Thursday, Oppenheim's tweet is just the latest in an interesting social media back-and-forth between Teigen and Oppenheim.

Real: Oppenheim, 43, the owner/co-founder of The Oppenheim Group featured on Netflix's Selling Sunset, tweeted to the 34-year-old Teigen, 'If you want to see if I’m real, I’ll be showing your house tomorrow morning to one of my clients'

It all started on August 18 when Teigen tweeted that she finally started watching Selling Sunset, which debuted its third season in August.

'I just watched all of Selling Sunset after watching everyone talk about it for so long! I don’t even think anyone on it is as mean or insane as you guys said? Maybe I’m just so used to it because I live here? This is pretty normal lol some are actually really nice,' she said in a tweet.

She added, 'Maybe I also know everyone on tv plays up a character. They’re all doing that. You guys are ... super mad at people who are in on the joke. '

Obsessively: The supermodel then questioned whether or not Oppenheim and the rest of the brokers on his team are real agents, stating, 'I will say, I look at LA real estate a lot and have never seen any of these people lol either have our agents, who I have obsessively asked'

That lead Oppenheim himself to respond a day later, stating, 'Chrissy, thanks for watching our show! Regarding your agent's knowledge of members of my team, I respectfully don't know him either although that doesn't mean he isn't successful and didn't just sell you a stunning home in Weho (seriously, I love your new house).'

Oppenheim was referring to the West Hollywood home that Teigen and her husband John Legend bought for $5.1 million in April, which Variety reports will largely be used as a set for Teigen's cooking show for Hulu that she's co-hosting with David Chang.

Teigen responded to Oppenheim's tweet stating, 'Honestly I don’t even know what agency our agent is with lol. Love the show! Pass your office every day, I’m an open house nut and am very sad I missed burgers and botox!'

She was referring to an open house that Oppenheim Group broker Christine Quinn threw in the second season. 

If Oppenheim does in fact sell Teigen and Legend's home, it's entirely possible that the sale could be featured on an upcoming season of Selling Sunset.

Teigen and her husband John Legend listed their Beverly Hills home in August for $24 million.

The couple purchased the home, which was previously owned by Rihanna, in January 2016 for $14.1 million.

The 8,520-square-foot three-story home boasts 5 bedrooms, 8 bathrooms, sitting on a .86-acre parcel of land.
