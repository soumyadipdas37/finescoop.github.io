Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy was pictured arriving bright and early at Tottenham's Enfield training base on Friday as he looks to conclude Gareth Bale's return to the club. 

As Sportsmail exclusively revealed on Wednesday, the formalities of a season-long loan deal worth £13million in wages has been finalised with an announcement expected imminently. 

Bale is due to fly to London on Friday following some final medical checks in Madrid having already said goodbye to his team-mates at Real's Valdebebas training facility on Thursday.  





Levy was temperature tested by security staff on his arrival as part of ongoing protocol amid the coronavirus pandemic.
