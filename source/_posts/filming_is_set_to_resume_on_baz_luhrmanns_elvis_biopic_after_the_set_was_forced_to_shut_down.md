Six months after they were forced to shut down because of coronavirus, filming is set to resume on the Queensland set of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic.

In a statement to the media on Thursday, it was announced the star-studded production would resume on September 23.

The musical drama details the life of legendary rockstar Elvis Presley, with American actor Austin Butler set to star as the icon.

Tom Hanks will star as Elvis' notorious manager, Colonel Tom Parker, while Australian actress Olivia DeJonge will feature as Priscilla Presley.

Production was forced to close back in March, after Tom, 64, and his wife of 32 years, Rita Wilson, both contracted coronavirus.

In a statement on Thursday, Baz, 57, said he was looking forward to finally getting back to work on the blockbuster.

'We're back to, as Elvis liked to say, "taking care of business!"' he began. 

'It is a real privilege in this unprecedented global moment that Tom Hanks has been able to return to Australia to join Austin Butler and all of our extraordinary cast and crew to commence production on "Elvis". 

'I cannot emphasise enough how lucky we feel in the current climate that the state of Queensland, and Queenslanders in general, have been so supportive of this film.'

The acclaimed director said he hoped to 'be an example [of] how creativity and productivity can proceed safely and responsibly in a way that protects our team and the community at large'.

He said production would resume once Tom was out of mandatory quarantine, with the Oscar winner flying into the Gold Coast on Tuesday night.  

'We are all excited to start working with Tom Hanks when he is out of quarantine in two weeks,' added Baz.
