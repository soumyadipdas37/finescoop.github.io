Ole Gunnar Solskjaer kept his cards close to his chest regarding Manchester United's late transfer plans this summer following their 3-0 victory over Brighton in the Carabao Cup.

United's transfer dreams certainly haven't gone to plan as they continue to stumble in their pursuit of England star Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.

United's priority target all summer has been Sancho but they have yet to stump up Dortmund's remarkable £108million asking price, and the Red Devils have so far only signed Donny van de Beek in a £40million deal from Ajax.

And following United's progression to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals thanks to goals from Scott McTominay, Juan Mata and Paul Pogba against Brighton, Solskjaer remained tight-lipped over the club's plans.

When asked about United's transfer activity, Solskjaer told Sky Sports: 'I can't give you any news now. We are working with the squad we've got. If there are any updates, we will give them.'

Then when specifically quizzed on the club's pursuit of Sancho, Solskjaer replied: 'I don't comment on any other teams players.

'I can't concern myself about other clubs, I have to concern myself on what we're doing. The club have worked well, and are working hard to have as strong a squad as possible. And there are situations we can't control.' 

Following Wednesday's victory at the Amex Stadium, former United midfielder Darren Fletcher urged the club to give Solskjaer the required funds to challenge at the top of the table this season.

'The job Ole has done since he came in to the team now, he deserves the players he wants,' Fletcher said.

'He needs to do it for himself because he will be judged at the end of the season on results. They need three to five players. The board need to back him and get him some help.'

United are set for an extremely busy end to the transfer window, which closes on October 5.

The Old Trafford outfit, who still have their heart set on Sancho, have also been linked with the likes of Edinson Cavani, Luka Jovic, Ousmane Dembele and Alex Telles.
