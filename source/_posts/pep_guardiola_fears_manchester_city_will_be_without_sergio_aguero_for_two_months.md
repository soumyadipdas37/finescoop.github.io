Pep Guardiola fears Sergio Aguero may not reach match fitness for two months as Manchester City embark on a new season with selection headaches.

Sportsmail reported on Friday that the Argentine was still training alone following knee surgery after suffering a meniscus injury in June.

Aguero, who scored 23 goals last season, is undertaking ball work with strength and conditioning coach Donough Holohan but his manager believes the team will be without him for some time. ‘We knew that the injury was difficult,’ said Guardiola.

Defender Aymeric Laporte has only just returned to training after a positive coronavirus test

‘He is doing his job, in maybe one month or two months he will be ready.

‘He has to come back on the pitch and regain the physical condition. Sergio was out for a long time and he is not a guy who regains the condition quick.’

Aguero had initially hoped to play some part in last month’s Champions League and, at 32, his prolonged rehabilitation is proving troublesome for City.

City are looking at a long-term replacement for the club’s greatest ever goalscorer, with Aguero’s current contract finishing next summer. In the short-term, Guardiola has Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling as his most likely options to lead the line.

City might have added Lionel Messi to their ranks but the forward saw a move away from Barcelona blocked, publicly stating that he refused to engineer an exit through the courts.

Guardiola also has worries at the back, with City’s slow pursuit of a new right-sided central defender exacerbated by the fact Aymeric Laporte is set to miss Monday night’s match at Wolves.

Laporte returned to training yesterday after self-isolating for a fortnight following a positive coronavirus test. ‘Riyad Mahrez came back four days ago and today was the first day Aymeric is coming back,’ said Guardiola. ‘Riyad will be available, Laporte not yet.’

Laporte’s absence raises the prospect of Nathan Ake, a £40million summer signing from Bournemouth, making his debut at Molineux as City begin their Premier League campaign a week late. ‘We have to help Ake and Ferran Torres to settle as quickly as possible,’ added Guardiola.
