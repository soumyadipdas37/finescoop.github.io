It comes after Zara detailed how she was victim to revenge porn twice and is now working with Refuge charity to try and overhaul and strengthen laws surrounding the heartbreaking crime.   

Speaking to Loose Women on Friday about her own experience, she said: 'I’ve been a victim of revenge porn, or what is called Image Based Sexual Abuse, twice in my life... 

'Notably, when I came out of Love Island, and came out to images of me, what felt like, circulating around the whole world. It was one of the hardest things I went through in my whole life.'

It comes after Zara split from Made In Chelsea regular Sam Thompson, 28, in September. 

While Zara has yet to publicly confirm or deny claims she cheated on former beau, she has been sharing cryptic quotes on social media. 

The singer wrote earlier this month on her Instagram Stories: 'Your heart knows the way, run in that direction.

Love always won in the end. No matter how it happened, no matter what it took, no matter what it meant. Fair or not, true or not. Love won.'

Adding a sad face emoji, Zara's second post then stated: 'We have all hurt someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. We have all loved someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. 

'It is an intrinsic human trait, and a deep responsibility, I think, to be an organ and a blade. But, learning to forgive ourselves and others because we have not chosen wisely is what makes us most human. 

'We make horrible mistakes, it's how we learn. We breathe love, it's how we learn, and it is inevitable.' 

A source revealed to MailOnline that a tryst took place between Zara and 'someone in the music industry' around the time she took part in X Factor: Celebrity.

The reality star appeared on the series last summer and autumn, as part of the Love Island pop group No Love Lost.

Who have you hurt? She then shared a second quote about 'hurting someone' and 'making horrible mistakes' 

At this point, she had been in a relationship with Sam for several months – but it's said the newly-single star has only recently found out about the infidelity. 

A source told MailOnline: 'Zara cheated on Sam with someone in the music industry. Someone connected to the X Factor.  

'Sam is obviously distraught about this. He only found out about it very recently and has escaped for a few days. 

'Zara regrets it and feels terrible. She knows it was a huge mistake and is extremely upset.

'Zara and Sam split towards the end of last month. They had been arguing a lot since moving in together as a result of lockdown and things just built up between them.

'Zara has moved back to her parents' house in Essex where she's taking some time for herself, she really loved Sam so this hasn't been easy for her.

'Sam has gone away to have a break from it all and clear his head away from Zara and social media.' 

MailOnline contacted representatives for Zara and Sam for comment at the time.
