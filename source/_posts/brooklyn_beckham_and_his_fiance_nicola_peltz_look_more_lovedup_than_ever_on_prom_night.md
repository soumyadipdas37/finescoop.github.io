They recently sparked speculation that they have already tied the knot in secret after announcing their engagement in July.

And Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz put on a loved-up display in a series of snaps taken as they enjoyed a drink.

Nicola, 25, posted the photos to her Instagram account which saw Brooklyn, 21, jokingly pretend to wring her neck.

In another snap, the couple looked on cloud nine as they shared a kiss while in another photo they linked arms while sipping a drink.

Alongside the post, the actress wrote: 'tb to prom night', with Brooklyn commenting underneath: 'My amazing girl ❤️'.

Brooklyn sported a grey printed T-shirt along with a light grey blazer while Nicola kept it casual in a black top with a V-neckline. 

It comes after Brooklyn recently referred to Nicola as 'my wife' in a sweet Instagram post last month, appearing to confirm speculation they have already married in secret. 

Date night: Nicola posted the photos to her Instagram account which saw Brooklyn jokingly pretend to wring her neck.

The photographer set tongues wagging when he showed off a gold band on his wedding finger, with his followers asking if the pair had already married in secret.

Appearing to confirm the union, the son of David and Victoria Beckham, commented 'my wife' on a smitten snap of the pair - which Nicola had captioned 'My forever'.

Wedding speculation started last month when Nicola shared a cryptic snap of a gold ring on Brooklyn's finger.

The image shared to Nicola's Instagram Stories showed the couple clutching a label, with Brooklyn sporting a gold band on his left hand.

Brooklyn's mother Victoria then uploaded a snap of her son alongside his younger brother Cruz, 15, with a gold ring visible on his wedding finger.

Brooklyn took to Instagram in July to announce his engagement to Nicola following reports he had popped the question to his 'soulmate' after just eight months of dating.

Sharing a stunning snap of the couple, he wrote: 'Two weeks ago I asked my soulmate to marry me and she said yes xx

'I am the luckiest man in the world. I promise to be the best husband and the best daddy one day. I love you baby xx.'

MailOnline contacted representatives at the time. 

Smitten: Brooklyn referred to Nicola as 'my wife' in a sweet Instagram post last month, ramping up speculation they have already wed

Speculation: Appearing to confirm the union, the son of David and Victoria Beckham, commented 'my wife' on a smitten snap of the pair - which Nicole had captioned 'My forever'

Nicola's new post comes after it was claimed she could be set to wed fiancé Brooklyn at London landmark St Paul's Cathedral, according to The Sun.

The photographer's parents David, 45, and Victoria, 46, are able to request to hold Brooklyn's marriage at the iconic venue due to their OBE status.

Choosing the London cathedral as the couple's wedding venue comes with a price however, as they would have to wait until 2022 due to a long waiting list.

Brooklyn and Nicola would be following in the footsteps of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer who married there in 1981, shunning the traditional Westminster Abbey.

A source told the publication: 'David and Victoria are aware Brooklyn can get married at St Paul's. 

Sweet: Brooklyn took to Instagram in July to announce his engagement to Nicola following reports he had popped the question to his 'soulmate' after just eight months of dating 

'They are overseeing their British wedding and want to make sure it has the wow factor for Nicola's family.

'If they went ahead, the wedding would have real gravitas and set the benchmark for what comes later in America. Brooklyn and Nicola are weighing up their options.' 

The ceremony would be traditional and has to include at least one Bible reading, while any sort of contemporary music would be off the cards. 

Wedding ceremonies are held in the Chapel of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the crypt, and applications have to be passed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. 

The publication reported that the basic cost of a wedding at the cathedral would be more than £5,000, as the ceremony alone costs £3,240.  

MailOnline contacted representatives for comment at the time.
