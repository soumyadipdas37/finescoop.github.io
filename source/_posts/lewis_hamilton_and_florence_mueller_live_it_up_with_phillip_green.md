 They have been seen living it up together on a luxury European jaunt. 

And Lewis Hamilton did little to quash rumours of a romance with model Florence Mueller as they were seen taking to the high seas on disgraced fashion tycoon Phillip Green's £100m superyacht, Lionheart.

It is the second time the duo have joined the Topshop boss on his yacht, which is complete with helipad, pool, 15 crew cabins and room for 12 guests,as they have been taking to the highs seas between Lewis' stints at the Formula One last weekend.  

Lavish: Lewis Hamilton did little to quash rumours of a romance with model Florence Mueller as they were seen taking to the high seas on disgraced fashion tycoon Phillip Green's £100m superyacht, Lionheart

Florence is part of Next Model Management's Miami roster and also works with Click Models, she is fluent in English, Spanish, and German and also has her own Only Fans account. With her long limbs, toned abs and luscious raven locks, Florence bore a striking resemblance to his former flame, Nicole Scherzinger.  

But a source speaking to The Sun on Sunday claimed that Lewis and the model were strictly friends, as they claimed they were 'just good mates.'The inside said: 'Lewis and Florence aren’t dating, they’re just good mates. She joined him on the boat as part of a group of pals with Lewis.

'They get on but there’s nothing romantic going on between them at the moment.' MailOnline has contacted Lewis' representatives for comment. 

Lewis and Nicole called time on their on and off eight year relationship in 2015 but have remained amicable, reuniting last year at the Fashion Awards in London in December. 

Wow: It is the second time the duo have joined the Topshop boss on his £100m yacht which is complete with helipad, pool, 15 crew cabins and room for 12 guests,

Good pals: Florence certainly proved her model credentials as she walked ahead of the F1 ace, who was in a more pared-back ensemble than his favoured wild looks

Heading off: Lewis joined Phillip in zipping over to the vast vessel in a smaller boat 

Speaking about their split during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, Nicole revealed: 'I don't see anything negative.

'I think it's quite natural when people separate and go their own ways and you just have to be adult about it and just always wish the other person happiness, success and love like sincerely and I do.'

When asked whether they still stay in touch, the Poison hitmaker - who first started seeing the race car driver in 2007 - was frank in her admission. 

Flashing away: Phillip seemed to be keen to give Florence a run for her money as he too was flashing his stomach

She added: 'Yeah we don't, like, talk. I think that he is the best driver since Ayrton Senna and I think that he's probably going to win this year and I only wish him happiness and success.'

The American beauty is now dating retired British rugby player Thom Evans after meeting on Celebrity X Factor at the end of last year. 

They may have been dating for less than a year, but Nicole and Thom are clearly devoted to one another and divide their time between her LA pad and London.
