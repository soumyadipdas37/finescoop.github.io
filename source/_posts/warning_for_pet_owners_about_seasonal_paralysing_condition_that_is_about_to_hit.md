The thousands of Australians who have bought pets during the coronavirus lockdowns have been warned to watch out for paralysis ticks as the weather warms up.

Queensland veterinarian Dr Holly Goldring said her clinic is seeing more cases of pets being preyed on by ticks than usual this year.

While long-term pet owners are aware of the danger, the increase in cases could be due to the many first-time owners. 

'We are seeing more cats because people probably don't know there is a good preventative for them,' she told the ABC.

She said outside pets are the most vulnerable and pet owners should pay attention to changes in an animal's behaviour.

Dr Goldring said a dog or cat that seems off-colour or lacking its usual energy should set off alarm bells.

However, it does take pets a few days to start feeling unwell. 

Dr Goldring said pet owners should get their pets regularly checked for ticks as they can be hard to find.

'When we know we are looking for a tick it can take 20-30 minutes to find it, and that's professionals doing it,' she said.

'Often it's only until they have fed for a couple of days and they are big that you can find them, and then it's a bit late.'

She said no pet should die of tick paralysis in 2020.

Dr Goldring said pet owners should check their dog's paws and face for ticks after they have been in a leafy environment, as those are the most common places.

However, she noted there have been instances where ticks have been found between claws or under tails. 

Dr Anne Chester, RSPCA QLD's senior veterinarian, has previously made similar comments about ticks to pet owners.  

'Our main concern is the paralysis tick,' she said. 

'All pet owners should seek advice from their vet on the best form of tick prevention. 

'You really do need to check for ticks daily, even if they are taking tick preventives.'

She suggested that pet owners also look out for dry coughs, or a change in a bark or meow.
