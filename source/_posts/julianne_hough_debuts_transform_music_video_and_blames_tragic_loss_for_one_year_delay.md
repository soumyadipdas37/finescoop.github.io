Julianne Hough debuted the music video for Transform on Sunday, one year after the release of the song. 

The dancer and singer shared the video, which was directed by brother Derek Hough, on her Instagram page, along with an explanation as to why it took so long for her to release it.

'I was about to release this video, when the most tragic loss of my life abruptly occurred,' she confessed, which is likely a reference to the deaths of her beloved Cavalier King Charles spaniel dogs, Lexi and Harley, in September 2019.

'Time passed, and I felt I had missed my window to release this video.⁣'

Finally: Julianne Hough debuted the music video for Transform, one year after the release of the song, along with an explanation to the delay

Hough went on to reveal how she wrote the dance-infused song 'during a highly transformative time' in her life when she was delayering all of her 'personal, social, and religious conditioning'.

She also felt like she was 'finding compassion and empathy for ALL parts of me, not just the "good" parts.'

'Personally, this past year has been the most challenging period of my life,' she confessed, which may also be a hint to her separation from husband Brooks Laich that was announced in May 2020.

'Collectively, we are experiencing a global pandemic, extreme injustice, polarization, environmental devastation, and an economic downturn that has contributed to increasing anxiety, depression and fear amongst us.' 

The Utah native said she decided to release the video in hopes that 'you can see that through the courage and resilience that we innately have within us, we can choose how we live in the world... through the "FEAR of change" or the "JOY of Transformation".'

After sharing about her excitement over the release of the video, Hough talked about she hopes it would bring 'some light, color, and FUN to the world right now.'

Some of the personal strife Hough has been battling can be easily read in the lyrics.

'Beauty feels ugly sometimes - These are just words that we use to define - And they keep talking, talking, talking - I can't stop the voice in my mind - That makes beauty feel ugly sometimes,' she sings in the first verse to a bass drum heavy beat. 

The beat drops out just as she makes a confession in the pre-chorus with the lines: 'I got a voice I wanna scream -I gotta own every part of me - All for the sake of love.'

The music opens up and transforms into a classic 80s-90s dance beat by the time it drops into the chorus. 

'I, I don't wanna hate - I wanna adore - And appreciate the pieces on the floor, yeah,' she sings in a plea for her better self.

'I, I don't wanna change -I wanna transform - Be me but better than I was before - Be better, better - I wanna transform - Be me but better than I was before.'
