Jessica Simpson shared a heartwarming Instagram snap this Tuesday of her elder two children all ready for the first day of school.

The singer shares her daughters Maxwell, eight, and Birdie, one, as well as her son Ace, seven, with her second husband Eric Johnson of NFL fame.

In Jessica's sweet Instagram picture Maxwell could be seen throwing an arm affectionately around her little brother.

'First day of 2nd and 3rd grade for these two kiddos. Ace has a busted lip and Maxi has a busted chin. Finished the summer out strong,' Jessica wrote with the photo.

Although Ace was wearing a backpack it appears it was just for show as the family live in Los Angeles where virtual schooling is the order of the day.

Los Angeles public schools have all switched to online learning, but California allows public and private elementary schools to apply for reopening waivers.

However early this month the Los Angeles Times reported that, owing to its coronavirus rates, Los Angeles County is not considering waiver applications.

Jessica's younger sister and fellow pop act Ashlee Simpson is currently expecting her own third child, her second by her current husband Evan Ross.

Like his wife Evan comes from a showbiz family - his mother is legendary singer Diana Ross and his sister is actress Tracee Ellis Ross.

Ashlee shares her son Bronx, 11, with her first husband Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy fame whom she was married to from 2008 until 2011.

Three years after their divorce she married Evan and in 2015 they welcomed their daughter Jagger, who is now five years old.

Before Jessica married Eric, a former NFL tight end, she spent 2002 until 2006 married to her fellow singer Nick Lachey.

Nick has gone on to marry Vanessa Minnillo, whom he was infamously pap-snapped getting intimate with in a hot tub in Mexico while they were dating.
