He is one of the wealthiest sportsmen on earth. 

Yet boxing legend Anthony Joshua has not let his millions haze his attitude to dating as he candidly joked that he demands his dates stay low cost, as he took part in a challenge with Peperami Chicken Bites to find love at first bite.

The sportsman, who is worth £47million, tickled his date when he said: 'No starters - straight to the mains. Expensive! I look at what's the cheapest on the menu!'

Uh oh! Boxing legend Anthony Joshua has not let his millions haze his attitude to dating as he candidly joked that he demands his dates stay low cost, as he took part in a challenge with Peperami Chicken Bites to find love at first bite

Anthony was discussing his love of food and how it influences his dating life as he took part in the new challenge alongside three stunning ladies. 

The trio had to cook for Anthony before he blind taste tested which he preferred while the lucky lady nabbed a date with the iconic boxer. 

As he sat down to his date, Anthony began chatting about what he looks for in love as he said: 'Is food the way to my heart? It plays a part. What do I look for in love? The energy, the connection, the aura with someone.'

While he was certainly romanticising his aims for love, a dinner date seems wholly less romantic due to his tight purse strings. 

Don't get too excited! The sportsman, who is worth £47million, tickled his date when he said: 'No starters - straight to the mains. Expensive! I look at what's the cheapest on the menu!'

This is not such a problem as he admitted he does not have the most dazzling dating life, saying: '“The honest answer is I don’t really date. My last date was in the boxing gym…with boxing, I am married to boxing really...

'I don’t really do dates, I am not really interested in it. I am much more in to just being in relaxed situations and developing friendships...

'I don’t think my schedule plays any part in really I just don’t put pressure on situations. In terms of kids I guess it is down to the individual circumstances.'

Working on it: While he was certainly romanticising his aims for love, a dinner date seems wholly less romantic due to his tight purse strings

On his dream date, Anthony went on: 'Like I said I am not a big fan of the date situation but if I was on a date I would find a good local restaurant...

'For me no food is off limits, I would just like who I am with to enjoy themselves and eat exactly what they want to. I am definitely not a food snob.'  

Anthony's romantic life is minimally publicised, however he has been linked to a string of stars including Maya Jama and Rita Ora.
