They have returned to NYC after spending lockdown in LA. 

And Emily Ratajkowski and her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard are settling smoothly back into life in the Big Apple as they were seen enjoying dinner with pals in The Hamptons on Sunday evening. 

The model, 29, kept things low-key in jeans and a loose-fitting tee while her husband, 39, placed a tender hand on the small of her back after the meal.

Emily proved she looks as stunning on-duty as off as she headed out in the jeans and tee for the perfect look for the meal. 

She wore her brunette locks in loose lengths while donning a pair of thick gold hoop earrings and a pared-back make-up style.  

Sebastian donned a baseball cap with a bold yellow top with long sleeves.  

The star and her husband Sebastian have recently returned to New York after quarantining in California for a period of time.

In an interview with GQ, Emily said it had been 'interesting' self-isolating with Sebastian, and predicted the quarantine may lead to many divorces. 

'It’s been interesting being in quarantine and married. I feel like a lot of people will end up divorced. But my husband and I are in a good partnership...

'And I think that I’ve learned a lot about myself being married, for sure.'

Emily surprised fans back in 2018 after announcing she had tied the knot with Sebastian at a NYC courthouse, with social media sensation Fat Jewish among those in attendance.

While the lightning-fast relationship surprised many fans, the couple were actually friends for years prior to becoming romantic.

'Emily has known Sebastian for years,' a source told Us Weekly at the time. 'They were all in a friend group. He wasn’t a stranger.'
