Donny van de Beek has got stuck into training on his first day at Manchester United following his £40m arrival from Ajax last week.

The 23-year-old has arrived in England to join up with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men after international duty with Holland and will start getting to know his United team-mates.

And he even had time to pose for a picture with his new manager and club captain Harry Maguire, who himself had returned to pre-season training earlier this week for the first time since being arrested in Greece last month.

While the Premier League season begins in earnest this weekend, United have an extra week to prepare for their kick-off against Crystal Palace on September 12.

Their involvement in the latter stages of the Europa League in Germany last month granted them a later start than the majority of their rivals. 

After clinching a return to the Champions League with a final day victory over Leicester in July, van de Beek's arrival is a particular cause for excitement with United supporters.

United fans are eagerly awaiting the prospect of him forging a midfield partnership alongside Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes.

After featuring for Holland in their defeat by Italy on Monday night, van de Beek bid a fond farewell to Ajax's most devout supporters outside the Johan Cruyff Arena.

They serenaded him with songs, held up banners paying tribute and set off flares. The midfielder was clearly moved by the gesture and he got out of his car and clapped them back as they said their goodbyes.

Van de Beek joined Ajax's academy back in 2008 and went on to become a fan favourite in Amsterdam.

The midfielder, who scored 41 goals and created 34 assists in 175 matches for the club, won the Eredivisie title in 2018-19 while also playing an instrumental role in his side's run to the Champions League semi-finals the same season. 

'Donny has all of the technical attributes needed to perform in this team and has the personality required to succeed at Manchester United,' Solskjaer said upon confirming the signing.

'His ability to see space, time his movements and read the game will really complement the qualities that we have in midfield and his arrival really strengthens the depth of talent we have in that position.  

'Donny’s performances in the Eredivisie and in Europe have been excellent over the last few years and we are all looking forward to working with him.'
