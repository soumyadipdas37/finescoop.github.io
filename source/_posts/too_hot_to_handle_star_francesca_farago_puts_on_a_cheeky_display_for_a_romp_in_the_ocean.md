Too Hot to Handle winner Francesca 'Frankie' Farago put on a cheeky display in a thong bikini on the beach in California on Wednesday.

The 26-year-old's outing comes after she spent some time in Utah with her new beau, Bachelorette winner Jef Holm, during a group vacation earlier this week. 

Jef confirmed the couple's budding romance but said while they're spending quite a lot of time together, they're 'taking things slow.'

Farago proudly showed off her fit figure in a pair of cheeky black bikini bottoms and a white sports bra.

Her trip appeared to be one where she hoped to be seen since she was wearing a full face of glamorous makeup while frolicking in the sand just before sunset.

The Canadian actress had her long chestnut hair down and sported a 90s classic - a denim bucket hat - which is very on trend at the moment.

The reality star was joined on Venice beach by pal Raiane Macedo who showcased her own impressive figure in a cheeky royal blue bikini.

Frankie is back in California after spending a few days with her new boyfriend Jef Holm in Utah on his family boat.

Jef, 36, dished about their new relationship, which began through a mutual friend, in an interview with E! News on Tuesday.

'She's a lot of fun to be around,' Holm said. 'We've been hanging out and getting to know each other. She's a great person inside and out and we have a lot in common. I definitely have a crush on her.'

He added: 'People are quick to put a title on things but we're just in the beginning stages and are taking things slow.'

Love history: Holm appears to be Farago's first promising relationship since her reported flings with YouTuber Tana Mongeau and Jersey Shore's Vinny Guadagnino

Things didn't look slow on Instagram, however, with the pair cuddling together during a boat ride along with her fluffy Pomeranian. 

The RiSE Festival managing partner seems to be Farago's first promising relationship since her reported flings with YouTuber Tana Mongeau and Jersey Shore's Vinny Guadagnino. 

In June, the vegan influencer suffered a bitter break up with fellow Too Hot to Handle winner, Harry Jowsey.

And, Frankie has stirred up quite a bit of reality show drama recently as she was also recently spotted holding hands with Love Is Blind star Damian Powers after a romantic dinner in LA. 

'People are quick to put a title on things but we're just in the beginning stages and are taking things slow,' Jef said. (The couple is pictured together on Monday)

Powers, who is still dating his Love Is Blind co-star Giannina Gibelli, tried to clear the air, telling Entertainment Weekly that the situation was totally innocent.

He said that the pair were introduced by their mutual attorney, Alex Ion, who arranged for the fellow Netflix reality stars and their friends to enjoy an evening in LA. 

Powers told the outlet: 'Alex arranged for both Francesca and I to meet with him for dinner at the Eveleigh in West Hollywood along with some of our other friends, including Mitchell Crawford and Raiane Macedo.' 

'Upon exiting the Eveleigh, we were all greeted by paparazzi. Francesca grabbed on to me in an attempt to shield herself from the paparazzi as our entire group entered the car. Francesca and I are not dating or romantically involved but remain friends,' he concluded.
