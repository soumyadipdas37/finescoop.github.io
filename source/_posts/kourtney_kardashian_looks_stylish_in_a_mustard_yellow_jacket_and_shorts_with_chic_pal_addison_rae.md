She always knows how to show off her sartorial prowess.

And Kourtney Kardashian was sure to turn heads after enjoying dinner with her pal, and Tik Tok Star, Addison Rae, 19, and Harry Hudson, 27, in Malibu, California, on Sunday.

The reality star, 41, looked sensational in an oversized mustard yellow leather jacket and shorts, that helped her put her slender legs on display.

Kourtney offset her striking ensemble by wearing a simple white tank top, and she accessorised with a small cream handbag.

She boosted her height in a pair of nude heels, while she completed the look by wearing a beige face mask.

Kourtney wore her raven tresses in loose waves that fell over her shoulders, and she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion. 

Addison, meanwhile, looked effortlessly chic in a black tank top and matching trousers, and she stepped out in white trainers.

Thongs may be a trend you'd expect in the underwear department, but for spring/summer 2020 it was thong sandals that have got us all splashing the cash.

Namely, the 'Calypso 70' leather sandals by Gianvito Rossi which we've spotted on Katie Holmes and now Kourtney Kardashian. 

The shoe of the season is a glammed-up version of a flat flip flop with a strap between the shoes and a thin heel with trendy square toes.

Made in Italy, the tan leather sandals are the ultimate day to night heel you can wear with jeans and knitwear à la Katie or after dark with faux leather like Kourtney.

Kourtney's outing comes after she was seen arriving for dinner at Nobu Malibu with her ex Scott Disick on Friday last week.

She shares Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five with Scott, who she split from in 2015 after nine years together. 

The pair were seen pulling into the eatery together, with the Flip It Like Disick star, 37, risking a run-in with his ex Sofia Richie, who was also dining at the eatery with pals.

The TV star and Sofia, 22, are reported to have ended their turbulent romance, and they are now no longer on speaking terms after 'Scott officially called it off'.

'They have been off and on for two months,' said a source to E! News. 'Sofia really pushed to make things work between them after they initially broke up, but Scott officially called it off recently and they are no longer speaking.'

The insider also claimed that their age difference ultimately became an issue for the celebrity duo.
