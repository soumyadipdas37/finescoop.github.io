Three sharks have been caught near a netted Gold Coast beach where a surfer was mauled to death, as investigations into the attack continue.

Nick Slater, a 46-year-old real estate agent, was fatally bitten on the leg while surfing at Greenmount Beach at about 5pm on Tuesday. 

His death is only the second fatal shark attack at one of Queensland's 85 beaches that have been protected by nets and drum lines since 1962, the state government said. 

But it has now been revealed the 57km coastline is only protected by 2km of nets, causing fears beachgoers are not as safe as they once thought. 

Early analysis of a tooth lodged in Mr Slater's longboard has suggested the 46-year-old was killed by a 3.5m great white shark.

A photo of the tooth has been released by the Department of Fisheries, revealing it was 45mm long and 30mm wide. 

Queensland Fisheries said two sharks were caught on a drumline and in a shark net near Greenmount Beach in the hours after the attack.

'There was a 3.3 metre tiger shark alive on a Shark Control Program drumline at North Kirra,' a spokesman said in a statement.

A two-metre tiger shark was found in a net a Currumbin.

Both animals were euthanised and disposed of offshore.

'Further investigations will be conducted to discover if there is any link between it and the fatal attack,' Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told parliament on Wednesday.

On Thursday morning, a third shark was reportedly pulled from drum lines at Greenmount Beach.  

The horrific mauling was captured by surf watch cameras and witnessed by at least one other rider.

Before nets were put in place, the last fatal shark attack off a Gold Coast beach - 24 of which are now netted - was in 1958.

Mourners descended on Greenmount Beach on Wednesday morning to pay their respects.

A Westpac Lifesaver Rescue helicopter was circling in the area after first light looking for sharks.

Beaches from Burleigh to Snapper Rocks were closed and lifeguards are patrolling the waters on jet skis.

Thomas Richard Tate, Mayor of the Gold Coast, offered his condolences to Mr Slater's family on Wednesday morning.  

'Last time we've had a shark attack is 1958, over 60 years ago,' he told Today.

'It doesn't matter how long it has been, still a devastating shock to the community of the Gold Coast.' 

The mayor said the beaches would remain closed until it is determined the shark is no longer in the vicinity. 

An investigation will also try to uncover whether a dead tiger shark caught in a net off the Gold Coast beach is the same one that attacked the popular estate agent

Mr Tate said the shark attack was a reminder to all beachgoers to 'look after your mates'.

'I mean really it brings to reality, when we go off the land we go into water, it is the shark's domain,' he said. 

Footage from a Swellnet surf camera shows Mr Slater sitting in the water at the end of the line-up before the shark grabs him and pulls him under.

Water can be seen splashing around before the black silhouette of the shark swims away. 

Some surfers just metres away seem oblivious to what is happening.

Mr Slater is then seen floating face down in the water before fellow board-riders drag him to shore. 

The bite stretched from his upper thigh to his knee and a tooth from the predator remained lodged in his longboard.

Coastalwatch footage showed the moment directly after the attack, when a surfer paddled the victim to shore with the help of other beachgoers. 

Lifeguards were seen waiting on the sand before frantically working to treat the severe injury. 

The water was evacuated as lifeguards attempted to save the victim.

Emergency crews rushed to the popular tourist spot but the real estate agent could not be saved.

Mr Slater, who was surfing alone, was pronounced dead minutes after they arrived.

Surfer Jade Parker told 7News he first spotted a school of fish and up to 30 birds near the victim, which is what attracted the shark to the surfer. 

He had been walking along the footpath near a lookout when he noticed some commotion in the water.

'There were four or five people yelling and pointing at the water, and I looked out to where they were pointing and I spotted a board floating and a body was next to it,' he said.

Mr Parker just assumed the surfer had been knocked out because he wasn't moving so he ran down to the beach and swam to the victim, who was in waist deep water.

'There were about three on the scene before me and they were all trying to drag him in with the board he had. I helped drag him into the beach as well.'

When they arrived on the sand lifeguards were waiting with a stretcher but Mr Parker said he was 'pretty much gone' by the time they arrived.

Mr Parker said the injury stretched from the 'groin area to just below his knee'.

'It was pretty much all taken... there was nothing there, it was just hanging there by not much,' he said.

'Honestly, I do not want to get to the gory parts but he was in a bad way. He was not conscious. It looked like he had already pretty much passed away at that point in time.'

Mr Parker added that the attack would not put him off surfing.

'I know the sharks are always out there so I will just have to accept that fate,' he said.

The attack is the first on the Gold Coast since 2012, when a 20-year-old surfer was mauled at Nobby Beach.

It is the first fatal attack in the region in 62 years when Peter Gerard Spronk was killed in 1958.

He was mauled by a shark 250m off Surfers Paradise beach and died of his injuries despite lifesavers coming to his rescue.
