Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert chose Irena Srbinovska as his leading lady in Thursday's finale of The Bachelor, after professing his love for her. 

However, just days before the episode aired on Sunday, Locky could possibly have had an ex-girlfriend on his mind.

The 31-year-old's travel company, Four Elements Adventure Bali, shared a throwback photo of Locky with his former flame to Instagram, Love Island's Jordan Cayless.    

Was Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert (pictured) thinking about his EX just days before the finale? The Bachelor, 31, looked very loved-up with Love Island's Jordan Cayless, 28, in a throwback photo shared to Instagram on Sunday 

In the photo taken at Diamond Beach, Jordan, 28, revealed her enviable figure in a two-piece ensemble as she sat on the wooden steps of a cabana.

She gazed adoringly at Locky, who went shirtless, and placed one affectionate hand by her waist.

The post appears to simply be a case of poor timing, with the travel company using the photo alongside another of two friends, to promote a package tour.

It's also not known whether Locky uploaded the post, or another member from the Four Elements Adventure Bali team. 

Odd timing: Locky's travel company, Four Elements Adventure Bali, shared this throwback photo of Locky and Jordan to their Instagram page, to promote one of their tours. It's not known whether Locky uploaded the post, or a member of the team 

Brutal swipe: Meanwhile, there's no love lost between Locky and Jordan (pictured). The brunette, who starred on Love Island Australia in 2019, told New Idea last month that she believes Locky only signed up to the dating show for publicity 

Meanwhile, there's no love lost between Locky and Jordan.  

The brunette, who starred on Love Island Australia in 2019, told New Idea last month that she believes Locky only signed up to the dating show for publicity. 

Locky and Jordan dated from 2017 to 2019, with Jordan choosing to end the relationship. 

'I don't think he will end up married with kids with this person on The Bachelor': Jordan told the publication that she's sceptical Locky has found love with his winner 

Ouch! 'I saw the ad where he says, "I'm the type of guy to get down on one knee" and I thought, "Yeah, you will – for the publicity and the ratings!"' Jordan added 

Jordan revealed her scepticism that Locky has found love with his winner.

'I don't believe it. Obviously you have genuine feelings and you're in a bubble on the show, but no, I don't think he will end up married with kids with this person on The Bachelor,' she said at the time. 

'I saw the ad where he says, "I'm the type of guy to get down on one knee" and I thought, "Yeah, you will – for the publicity and the ratings!"' 

Jordan even claimed that Locky had previously mentioned he wanted to become The Bachelor, and that the attention and following would 'lift up' his business in Bali.
