A body has been found in the search for a missing student who vanished while out celebrating his 21st birthday.

Alec Unsgaard had recently moved to the UK from Sweden to study International Relations and Politics at the University of Bath when he went missing.

He was last seen on Friday, September 18, and his parents put out an emotional appeal for help finding him.

But a body has now been recovered and althought it has not been formally identified, police belive it to be Mr Unsgaard's.

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: 'The death is not currently being treated as suspicious but officers will continue to carry out enquiries on behalf of the coroner.

'We'd like to thank both the public and the media for their help in publicising our appeals to find Alec and our thoughts are with his family at this very difficult time.' 

Mr Unsgaard's parents said their son had saved money for two years to go to university in the UK.

They added: 'He was looking forward to moving from home to try something different, in a new environment. He's worked very hard for two years to save the money to go.

'He loves books and reading and is very sporty; he loves to play football. He is a very caring person and is much loved by his family and friends.

'We are extremely worried and greatly appreciate all the help that can be given to locate Alec.

Alec went missing alongside another student, Martin Bowers (pictured), 20, although they said the cases were not linked

'I would encourage people to look out for Alec and call the police with any sightings or information that would help us to find him.'

Alec went missing alongside another student, Martin Bowers, 20, although they said the cases were not linked.

A body was recovered from the River Avon in the Bedminster area after a week-long search that ended Friday, September 25. The third-year went missing on the night of Saturday, September 19 during a trip to Bristol. 

Inquests will be held into the deaths of both students at a later stage.
