Officer Aaron Brown was fired in 2018 after he was also accused of messaging about 'intentionally damaging property while executing search warrants'

A New Hampshire police chief is refusing to reinstate a fired cop accused of sending racist messages about shooting black people to his wife on his work cellphone after an arbitrator said he should get his job back. 

Officer Aaron Brown was fired in 2018 after he was also accused of messaging about 'intentionally damaging property while executing search warrants'; an investigation into that claim by the Strafford County Attorney's Office said there was not enough evidence to file criminal charges. 

Then in August last year an arbitrator said Brown should get his job back, arguing his punishment was too severe and he should have been instead suspended for 30 days. On August 24 this year the arbitrator said Brown was also entitled to back pay. 

But in a statement posted to Facebook last Friday the Manchester Police Department said Chief Carlo Capano 'has refused to implement the arbitrator's reinstatement order' with an unfair labor practice case currently pending as a result. 

The department accused Brown of sending 'text messages [to his wife] that included extremely disturbing racist remarks'. 

In a statement the department said: 'We are extremely saddened and sickened to see that an arbitrator could rule in this manner after hearing this egregious case. 

'We will do everything possible to make sure Brown is never in a Manchester Police uniform again.' 

In messages obtained by The Union Leader Brown is said to have written to his wife in 2017: 'Besides, I got this new fancy gun. Take out parking tickets no problem. FYI ‘parking tickets’ = black fella.' 

In a statement posted to Facebook last Friday the Manchester Police Department said Chief Carlo Capano 'has refused to implement the arbitrator's reinstatement order' 

The department said they began investigating Brown after receiving a complaint on his conduct in January 2018.  

But Brown's lawyer, Mark Morrissette, told CNN police 'harvested' more than 18,000 private message the officer had sent to his wife from his work phone and found 'three to four messages [that] referenced people in a disparaging manner'.

He said: '[The department] is trying to inflame the situation and describe him as being racist. That's unfair to Mr. Brown, he's had an honorable and commendable career. They promoted him and they've given him a number of awards during his career.'

Morrissette added: 'He himself has said he shouldn't have used those terms, they were wrong...it was private words he said to his wife that he would take back. 

'Again they go back several years, he was asked about these terms, he is not clear about the circumstances, they're in text messages with his wife. He admits they're inappropriate, they shouldn't have been used.' 

Mayor Joyce Craig said: 'Bad cops are bad for our police department, our residents, our neighborhoods, and our city.' 

In a statement the department said: 'We are extremely saddened and sickened to see that an arbitrator could rule in this manner after hearing this egregious case. We will do everything possible to make sure Brown is never in a Manchester Police uniform again'
