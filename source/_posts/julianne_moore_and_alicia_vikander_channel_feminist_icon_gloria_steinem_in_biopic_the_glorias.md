Four different actresses - including Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander - channel feminist icon Gloria Steinem in Julie Taymor's biopic The Glorias, which starts streaming on Amazon Prime Video/VOD on September 30.

The 59-year-old Oscar winner - who most resembles the 86-year-old women's rights activist - portrays her after age 40.

The 31-year-old Oscar winner plays Gloria from ages 20–40 when she co-founded Ms. magazine and helped campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment.  

Double take! Four different actresses - including Alicia Vikander (L) and Julianne Moore (R) - channel feminist icon Gloria Steinem in Julie Taymor's biopic The Glorias, which starts streaming on Amazon Prime Video/VOD on September 30

The trailer - which dropped Thursday - did not include the teenage and child versions of Steinem played by Lulu Wilson and Ryan Kira Armstrong, respectively.

'They are able to interact with each other, literally sit next to each other on that Greyhound bus traveling to the next march on Washington, or rally against abortion laws, or protest against injustices or conference on the equal amendment rights,' the 67-year-old filmmaker told People on Wednesday.

'They also can take each other's place in the middle of a scene.'

The legendary Bette Midler - who's only an Oscar away from EGOT status - took one the role of New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug, who co-founded the National Women's Political Caucus with Gloria.

R&B songstress Janelle Monáe (Harriet, Hidden Figures) plays the co-founder of Ms. magazine, Dorothy Pitman Hughes.

'Gloria is a living leader - a hero because she carved out her course in life against many odds and made it work for herself and for millions of women,' Taymor told the mag.

Taymor told the mag: 'Gloria is a living leader - a hero because she carved out her course in life against many odds and made it work for herself and for millions of women'

'Her humility, her ability to listen, her humor, her ease with she moves across cultural, racial and gender lines. She is the great communicator. I love her positive attitude to conflict. She is always looking to 'the upside of the downside' and one of her great expressions is, "The truth will set you free but first it will p*** you off."'

The Glorias feels a bit like déjà vu considering the nine-episode FX miniseries Mrs. America, which aired April-May on Hulu, also featured portrayals of Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug, and Flo Kennedy.

Mrs. America is nominated for six trophies at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards - airing September 20 on ABC - including for frontrunner Cate Blanchett who played anti-feminist Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly.
