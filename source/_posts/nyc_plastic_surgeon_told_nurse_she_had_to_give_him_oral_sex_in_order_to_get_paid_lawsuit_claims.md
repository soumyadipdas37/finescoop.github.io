A New York City plastic surgeon has been accused of sexual misconduct by his former nurse who claims he told her she had to give him oral sex in order to get paid, and later retaliated by having her arrested when she complained.

Meleny Safarlizadeh, 32, has filed a lawsuit against Dr David Shokrian, her former employer at Millennial Plastic Surgery PLLC in Midtown Manhattan.

The nurse claims she endured multiple instances of 'abuse and harassment' from Shokrian's 'deviant behavior', after she was hired at his practice in January 2019. 

According to court papers obtained by the New York Post, Shokrian had told Safarlizadeh she had to 'suck his c**k' if she wanted to get paid. 

Meleny Safarlizadeh, 32, has accused former boss Dr David Shokrian (right) of sexually harassing her after she was hired at Millennial Plastic Surgery PLLC in midtown Manhattan last January 

He also gave her a photo of the office credit card and allowed her to use it to make up for the wages that he owed, the lawsuit claims.   

Safarlizadeh said her boss had allegedly asked her out for drinks multiple times and had 'repeatedly' invited her to his room at a hotel, which she declined. 

She also claims Shorkian once asked her to expose her backside after using her in a demonstration for a 'butt cupping' technique in front of staff.

She said the doctor at one point gained access to her cellphone where she had nude photos of herself and shared them on social media without her permission.

Shokrian was allegedly able to 'hack' her phone after he had her sync it with the office calendar.

He then used the pictures to 'falsely' claim her body was a result of his surgical work, the lawsuit states.

Safarlizadeh, who is from New Jersey, claims the surgeon had her falsely arrested for crimes she didn't commit after she took action against him 

The nurse, who is from New Jersey, quit Shokrian's practice last December after she claims she was no longer able to put up with the harassment.

After taking action against her former employer, Safarlizadeh claims he framed her with crimes she didn't commit and was 'falsely arrested' in retaliation.

The court papers say Shokrian allegedly filed fake police reports accusing her of stealing patient files and of using the company card without permission.

She was charged with grand larceny and identity theft and is due to be arraigned next week, the Post reported.

'He used the criminal justice system as a tool. He fabricated a crime that never happened,' Safarlizadeh's civil lawyer Michael Joseph said.

The lawsuit claims Shokrian also tried to black list Safalizadeh by sharing the allegations against her on social media.

Shokrian's attorney, Gene Rosen, told the publication the doctor denies all allegations brought by his former employee and 'looks forward to complete vindication.'
