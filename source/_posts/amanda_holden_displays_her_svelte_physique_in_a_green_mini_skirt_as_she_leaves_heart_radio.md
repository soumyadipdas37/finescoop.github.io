It comes after Amanda made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday.

The presenter slipped into a plunging gold metallic dress as she took her place on the socially-distanced judging panel 

Amanda was in high spirits after being promoted to head judge for the semi-finals, as it was also revealed that her debut album Songs From My Heart had reached number one on the iTunes pre-order charts.

Due to Simon Cowell's absence Amanda has been promoted to head judge, and she was quick to joke she'll be backing 'musical theatre all the way.' 

Simon was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. 

The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.  

Wow! It comes after Amanda made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday
