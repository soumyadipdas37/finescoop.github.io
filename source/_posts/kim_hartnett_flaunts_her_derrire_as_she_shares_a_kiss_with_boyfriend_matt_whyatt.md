She admitted things were a little tense after Matt's season of Bachelor In Paradise aired as he was accused of dating multiple women in a short space of time since ending his relationship with co-star Renee Barrett.

'Things were a little more tense, but there was nothing said that Matt hadn't already told me prior to the show. He's been super honest, so I was never in the dark about anything,' Kim said, adding: 'We're definitely stronger than ever now.' 

'It's so easy, we hardly have any fights. We're super supportive of each other's goals,' she boasted of their relationship.
