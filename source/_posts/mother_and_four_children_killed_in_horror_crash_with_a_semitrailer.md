A Kansas mother-of-five and four of her children were killed after crashing into a semitrailer loaded with grain that officials say ran a stop sign in southwest Sedgwick County last week.

Jessica Noel, 32, of Viola, was driving her white Ford Expedition on 263rd Street shortly before 5pm when authorities say the driver of the grain truck failed to stop at a stop sign while headed east on 71 Street South.

The Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office said the Expedition struck the trailer, causing it to split into two pieces.

Noel's white Ford Expedition split into two parts, killing the woman and three of her children, including a four-month-old baby, on impact 

Noel and three of her children, identified as Anaiah Williams, 10, Jeffrey, four, and four-month-old Hank all died at the scene. Another child, 23-month-old Mack, succumbed to his injuries at the hospital. 

The driver of the semi-trailer walked away from the crash without any injuries. As of Monday morning, he has not been charged in connection to the deadly crash. 

'My heart and my family are broken over the loss of my sister-in-law and my four nieces and nephews,' Noel's brother-in-law said in a statement to KSN. There are just no words….Thank you to ever who has reached out by email, text, or otherwise. We are taking it one day at a time. 

Meanwhile, Noel's niece has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help her husband, Jeffrey Williams, and their sole surviving 10-year-old child. 

According to the description of the fundraiser, on Friday afternoon, Jessica Noel, known to her loved ones as Tess, had loaded four of her children into her SUV and headed to a grocery store.
