Bunnings customers have rejoiced as the hardware store's iconic sausage sizzle has returned to select stores.

Social media has lit up with overjoyed customers taking to their local store to sample Bunnings community sausage sizzles.

Tik Tok user DavidorSteven uploaded a video after he was ecstatic to find his local Bunnings outet in Oxley in Brisbane had reintroduced the popular fundraiser.

'Oh my God I almost had a freaking heart attack,' he says in the video. 'Why didn't anyone tell me the sausages are back?'

Mr Steven captioned the post 'it brought tears to my eyes' with many commentators hopeful for the iconic snags to return to their local store soon.

The hardware giant cancelled all sausage sizzles across Australia on March 18 over coronavirus fears.

Almost four months later on July 9, the sausage sizzle returned to select Bunnings stores in Tasmania and the Northern Territory using a new layout that promotes physical distancing and includes increased personal hygiene processes.

Sizzles return to ACT this weekend are are back in New South Wales on October 10. 

Bunnings suspended their fundraising sausage sizzles in March from covid fears before reintroducing them in Northern Territory and Tasmania on July 9 using a new covid safe layout

Two weeks later, select Bunnings stores in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia reintroduced the sausage sizzle, with 200 community groups holding fundraising barbecues. 

The return of the sausage sizzle is still being discussed in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. 

'We’d like to thank our customers for how patient they have been over the past few months with all the additional measures we have in place across our stores,' Bunnings Chief Operating Officer Deb Poole said in July.

'While we know they will be excited by this return, as are we, we’d just ask everyone to continue to be patient and respect the guidelines in place.'

The retailer said they are continuing to follow the government's advice during the coronavirus pandemic, with the sausage sizzle subject to government restrictions in each state. 

Community groups who were already booked in but had their events cancelled were given $500 gift cards by Bunnings to help with fundraising.
