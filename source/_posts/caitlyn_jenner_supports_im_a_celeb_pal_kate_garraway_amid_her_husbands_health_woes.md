The American star told the Daily Star: 'Kate, when she came home, her husband and coronavirus – it's been a tragedy.

'I talked to her the other day and as soon as we got on the phone, that voice of hers, I was like, "oh my God, that voice of hers, it has a familiarity".'

Caitlyn and Kate joined a host of stars – including Nadine Coyle, Roman Kemp, Ian Wright, and Myles Stephenson – to compete on I'm A Celeb, with former EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa emerging the ultimate victor.

On Friday, Kate revealed how she celebrated her 15th wedding anniversary with Derek on Thursday, after being unable to visit him in hospital. 

Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, the presenter revealed she would be seeing him later that day, but admitted it felt 'strange' as Derek is in a state of limited consciousness.

Kate revealed: 'We did our best to make it special. We had him on FaceTime. We raised a glass to say happy anniversary.

'I have a card to take to read to him. He was a prolific card writer for birthdays. He'd always remember. And hopefully he'll do it again.

'It will be strange reading to him, but this time I have made a bit more of an effort.' 

On Thursday, Kate admitted she was having a 'tough' day being unable to see her husband.  

Sharing her feelings on air with Susanna Reid and Adil Ray, Kate said: 'It's actually Derek and I's wedding anniversary today, unbelievably – 15 years today.

'What an extraordinary thing. I won't be able to see him today, I kind of hoped I would but it wouldn't work out that way for a visit… 

Woes: Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, the presenter revealed she would be seeing him later that day, but admitted it felt 'strange' as Derek is in a state of limited consciousness 

'But maybe it would be a bit strange anyway. So yeah, it's a tough day but he's still here. There's not a huge amount of change.'

Kate said that she hadn't seen Adil or Susanna for a while, and went on: 'So much happens in those couple of weeks, there's so many seeming positives, but actually when I see people again it's just the same.

'But you have to think, at least he's here with you – you have a flicker and then a bad day but you have just got to keep going really.'

Derek fell victim to COVID-19 in March and was rushed to ICU and put in a coma - where he has been since.

He is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things. His carers have been playing GMB on TV for him, while Kate is on. 

Kate returned to the studio having taken time out to settle her children into school, after what has been a challenging six months for the family.

She shares Darcey, 14, and William, 11, with Derek.

Derek is one of an estimated five people in the world whose bodies have been damaged so much by COVID-19. 

Kate contracted novel coronavirus herself at the same time as Derek, but made a full recovery.

 'He said he had a headache, numbness in his right hand, and was struggling to breathe,

'I rang Dr Hilary (Jones) and tried to get through, he talked to Derek. He said put me back on, I think you need to call an ambulance'

Derek, 52, was taken into hospital on March 30 and remained in an unresponsive condition.

MAY 

Kate said: 'The journey for me and my family seems to be far from over as every day my heart sinks as I learn new and devastating ways this virus has more battles for Derek to fight. 

'But he is still HERE & so there is still hope.'

She said: 'I'll never give up on that because Derek's the love of my life but at the same time I have absolute uncertainty'
