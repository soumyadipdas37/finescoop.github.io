Zoe Ball was pictured stepping out solo on Tuesday, as she was seen for the first time since her boyfriend Michael Reed faced shocking claims allegations from an ex.

Last week, Michael, 50, was slammed by his ex Lorraine Ashdown, the mother of his four-year-old daughter, who accused him of claiming benefits after being ordered to pay £20,000 in child support arrears.

But DJ Zoe, 49, appeared keen to put the drama behind her on Tuesday, when she was pictured strolling solo through the bustling streets of London.

The star looked casually cool, wearing a black quilted jacket with cropped faded jeans and a pair of white plimsolls.

With her flaxen locks falling to her shoulders, the star cracked a smile before putting on her face mask as she prepared to press on with her day.

Her outing comes days after Michael's ex Lorraine told The Sun: 'He's such a ducker and a diver and a chancer, and I think he has done this on purpose to avoid paying.

'I don't know if Zoe is aware of this, but she should tell him to sort it out. It is a disgrace that he is living the high life with her while avoiding his responsibilities.'

Michael and Zoe split in 2019 but got back together this year. It's thought they now live together. 

Michael is a former construction firm boss and, last month, was ordered to pay the child maintenance costs of  £19,290.94 to Lorraine, after allegedly under-estimating his earnings.

Lorraine cannot chase him for the money now that he is on benefits, according to the Child Maintenance Service.

Lorraine and Michael, both from Kent, split up not long after they had their child. Michael then moved to a four-bedroom home in Chislehurst, which he rented.

He is believed to have moved in with Radio 2 host Zoe, who lives in a £1.5million property in Sussex.

MailOnline has contacted Michael for comment, but he told The Sun on Saturday that the claims are 'incorrect'. 

Lorraine provided paperwork when speaking to the publication, seemingly backing up her claims.

Zoe will soon return to screens on Strictly: It Takes Two, alongside Rylan Clark-Neal.
