Authorities in Georgia are urging motorists to control their speed after a motorcyclist was clocked going 178 mph down a highway last Sunday. 

The Alpharetta Department of Public Safety posted an image of the speed gun after the bike moving at extreme rates sped past the officer on the Ga. 400. 

The post said the officer did not try to stop the motorbike for the violation as it was moving too fast.

The bike passed the speed gun on the Georgia 400 but was not stopped

They added that information on the bike was passed along to other agencies and law enforcement in nearby Atlanta.  

 'Hopefully, the driver of the sport bike matures a little before a tragedy happens,' the agency posted to its Facebook page.

'No, the officer didn't even attempt a stop. Just passed along the "brief" description to agencies south of us into Atlanta.' 

Alpharetta Department of Public Safety told DailyMail.com that there was no further information available on the biker and whether they were later stopped by another authority. 

This is not the first time a motorcyclist has evaded a police stop while going too fast on the Ga. 400. In April, Sandy Springs police reported a bike going 172 mph that was too fast to stop.  

As lockdowns were in place during the coronavirus pandemic, quieter roads saw motorists picking up their speed. 

In Georgia, tickets for speeding at 100 mph or more were up nearly two-thirds in late April compared to last year, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports. 

In one week state troopers wrote 140 citations, not including those written by local authorities. 

Speeding is Georgia is a misdemeanor and those caught can be hit with a fine of up to $1,000. 

According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, most jurisdictions in Georgia want anyone traveling 100 mph or faster to go straight to jail but fear of coronavirus spread has led the state patrol to cut back on arrests for speeding.
