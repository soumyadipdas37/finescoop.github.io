Kate Garraway returned to Good Morning Britain on Thursday and admitted it was a 'tough' day to come back. 

Kate, 53, revealed it also happened to be her and husband Derek Draper's 15-year wedding anniversary and that she's unable to see him due to his ongoing illness. 

Sharing her feelings on air with Susanna Reid and Adil Ray, Kate said: 'It’s actually Derek and I’s wedding anniversary today, unbelievably – 15 years today.

'What an extraordinary thing. I won’t be able to see him today, I kind of hoped I would but it wouldn’t work out that way for a visit… But maybe it would be a bit strange anyway.

'So yeah, it’s a tough day but he’s still here. There’s not a huge amount of change.'

Kate said that she hadn't seen Adil or Susanna for a while, and went on: 'So much happens in those couple of weeks, there’s so many seeming positives, but actually when I see people again it’s just the same.

'But you have to think, at least he’s here with you – you have a flicker and then a bad day but you have just got to keep going really.'

Derek fell victim to COVID-19 in March and was rushed to ICU and put in a coma - where he has been since.

He is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things.
