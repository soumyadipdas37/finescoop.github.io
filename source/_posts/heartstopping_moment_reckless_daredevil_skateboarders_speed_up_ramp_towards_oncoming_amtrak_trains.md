Two skateboarders in California decided to tempt fate by edging dangerously close to a railroad track as an Amtrak train sped by.

Video posted to social media shows the two men who appear to be in their 20s skateboarding up a ramp that leads to railway tracks.

As the Pacific Surfliner approaches, one skateboarder climbs up the ramp and skates back down as the board comes inches away from the speeding train.

Luckily, he managed not to get hit and avoid injury or even death

In the video’s next segment, the two skateboarders are seen going further up the ramp as the Amtrak train approaches from the opposite direction.

The two men let out screams as they enjoy the adrenaline rush.

The Pacific Surfliner is the Amtrak line that links San Diego at its southernmost tip to San Luis Obispo in central California.

It is unclear from the video where this incident took place.
