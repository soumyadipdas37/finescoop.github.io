A brattish banker has copped a mere $1,000 fine after ignoring flight crew instructions and attempting to kick police officers.    

Citibank Sydney managing director Thomas Hasan Dunmore Cribb, 39, threw his mid-air tantrum on a Qantas flight from Sydney to Auckland on February 21. 

He pleaded guilty to the obstruction of a Commonwealth officer and failing to comply with crew instructions on Tuesday, The Australian Financial Review reported.

The executive, who was dubbed part of 'generation next' at the US bank, faced Sydney's Downing Centre Court over his outburst. 

The court heard how Cribb became a nuisance after asking for another scotch an hour before the plane was due to land. 

Cribb introduced himself twice to the man sitting in front of him and had a loud conversation on his phone when electronic devices weren't allowed. 

He then got up to use the bathroom despite at least five requests from a flight attendant to return to his seat.   

The plane's captain called Australian Federal Police officers to meet the flight at the gate and remove Cribb. 

Cribb, a single father from Surry Hills, whined as he left the flight and launched a tirade of abuse at officers.    

'How dare you. I can't believe this is Australia, am I under arrest? 

'You have no idea who I am. You don't realise how big a mistake you've just made. You're gone. I'm taking your badge. You've just f****d up,' Cribb told police. 

Cribb later apologised for lashing out at police and the court heard the Citibank executive would be receiving a salary cut (Citibank headquarters pictured in New York city) 

Cribb demanded to see a Qantas staff member and a scuffle broke out as police attempted to arrest the banker.  

The 39-year-old then tried to kick at two of the officers as he was tackled to the ground.   

Cribb told police he wouldn't say anything until he could call speak to his lawyer but later apologised to an officer for injuring his thumb.   

'Yeah, I f****d up. I'm really sorry. I had a few drinks,' he told officers at the AFP's Sydney police station.   

Cribb's lawyer said the banker had faced the Citibank board and would have his salary reduced after the incident. 

His lawyer also noted Cribb had provided multiple 'glowing' character references that described him as 'a gentle soul'.  

Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson said she had taken into account Cribb's remorse, his lack of prior offences and the character references. 

She ordered Cribb to continue seeing his psychologist and placed him on a two years good behaviour bond without conviction.
