This is the astonishing underwater snap that won an international photography competition as a daredevil photographer caught the moment a huge whale shark's mouth was filled with a shoal of remora fish.

Evans Baudin, 32, captured the incredibly rare scene on a private dive in Baja California Sur, Mexico.

The huge female whale shark was friendlier than normal and swam right towards the French photographer who managed to capture the incredible scene before the world's largest fish moved away.

The marine wildlife expert had been documenting the impact of reduced boat traffic during the coronavirus pandemic, and the astonishing photo struck gold in Scuba Diving Magazine's annual photography competition.
