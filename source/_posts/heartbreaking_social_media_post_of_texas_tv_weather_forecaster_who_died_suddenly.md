A tv weather forecaster in Texas has died suddenly after publishing a heartbreaking social media post.

KCBD 11's weekend morning forecaster, who was born in 1978, had posted to Facebook earlier in the day to say that 'my brain is broken and I cannot take it anymore.'

In a statement, Dan Jackson, KCBD's Vice President, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the tragic and sudden loss of KCBD weekend morning forecaster Kelly Plasker. 

'Kelly was a dedicated member of the KCBD weather staff, well-liked by viewers, and admired by her co-workers. 

'Our deepest sympathies go out to Kelly's family in this time of great loss.

'We would like to thank the many viewers who have reached out through our social media channels in kindness and support to honor Kelly's memory. 

'Grief counselors have been made available to all members of the KCBD family struggling with this heartbreaking news.'

The Facebook post Kelly published on the day of her death talked about her high school band director who she claimed was a predator.

She finished the post by saying: 'Thanks all I needed to get out there as my final confession for the sins I am responsible for adding to the cross.

'I love you my friends. My brain is broken and I cannot take it anymore.'

Kelly's death comes almost three years after her son died by suicide, before his 20th birthday. 

Lubbock's Rock Station FMX 94.4's host Wes was a friend and co-worker of Kelly's and the Sun reports that the last time he talked to her was about work.

He said: 'The last time we talked, she was in great spirits. The last time she texted, I thought she was having physical problems. 

He said that her passing was still too raw for him to speak more personally but did say that they had made each other laugh for years and he wished they had had a few more years of laughter.    

Other people took to Twitter in tribute of Kelly.

Lauren Linahan of WTV Msaid: 'My heart is heavy. Thinking of Kelly Plasker’s family, friends, and coworkers tonight.'

Bryanna Gallagher of Fox23 provided details for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline and tweeted: 'Heartbreaking, my thoughts & prayers are with her family during this extremely difficult time.'







Tributes were paid on Twitter by other people, with condolences being paid to her family and her co-workers at KCBD11

WKRN's Elizabeth Lane tweeted: 'Kelly Plasker was a staple in Lubbock and will be missed. So sad to hear this news and for the @KCBD11 family.'

While WJHL's Sydney Kessler said in a tweet: 'It’s hard to lose such an amazing friend. Kelly Plasker, I’m missing you more and more every minute. You were the best co-worker, work wife & friend a girl could ask for. I love you so much and I’ll always wish I would have done more. #SuicideSucks

KCBD ran a news report tribute to Kelly on Sunday night which described her as 'a bright spot in our weekend mornings and in our lives'.

Although Kelly's cause of death has not yet been revealed, KCBD's tribute report ended by talking about National Suicide Prevention.

Ann Marie Casiraghi, who leads the Lubbock Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has warned: 'This is a real time where our entire nation and even the world is under a lot of stress, never seen before. So, we're asking that people, make connections with others.'
