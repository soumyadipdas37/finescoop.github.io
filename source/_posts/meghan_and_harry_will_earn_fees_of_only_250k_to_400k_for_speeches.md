Meghan and Harry will earn fees of 'only'  $250k to $400k for speeches because the level of control requested by the couple will put clients off, according to an events consultant.

The couple's fee was originally estimated to be around $1million but this prediction has been shattered by an international agency which runs VIP corporate events in both the UK and US.         

In a leaked contract, the event creator warned that many organisations will 'raise their eyebrows' at the couple's demands.

The requests are said to be similar to those adopted by all British Royals at public events - despite the Duke and Duchess stepping down as senior members to achieve more freedom. 

Meghan and Harry will earn fees of only $250k to $400k for speeches because the level of control requested by the couple will put clients off, according to an events consultant 

'Harry and Meghan coming on the speaker circuit is certainly as significant as the likes of President Obama or Arnold Schwarzenegger,' read a virtual event request form by the Harry Walker Agency seen by The Sun.

It continued: 'The pair are fascinating, uniquely experienced individuals, who have a wide reach, who would have been a huge draw to a live audience pre-COVID.

'So back then figures between the 750k and $1m mark seemed steep, but possible. Realistically their earnings range is closer to $250k to $400k...

'The contract paperwork appears to read that the speakers have full control of the client's event. It certainly raises eyebrows and will put off many potential large corporations. 

'Not many clients ever like inviting talent as star guests, who may be seen as running their event and telling them what to do.'

The requests state that the couple will need to give approval of each aspect of any corporate event with the events agency warning that many organisations will 'raise their eyebrows' at the couple's demands

The requests state that the couple will need to give approval of each aspect of any corporate event, including of anyone who might introduce them or moderate discussions, as well as the ability to probe sponsors and corporations beforehand.

The form went on to say that the terms and conditions set out by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were uncommon for 99 per cent of speakers already on the circuit.    

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Meghan and Harry as well as the Harry Walker Agency for comment.
