Kate Beckinsale stunned in a beautiful white and gold sequinned gown as she and Helen Mirren joined the star-studded arrivals at the 2020 Monte Carlo Gala for Planetary Health on Thursday.

The actress, 47, was a sight to behold in the form-fitting gown teamed with a matching face mask, while screen legend Helen, 75, displayed her ageless beauty in a fitted green gown.

Monte Carlo's annual gala aims to gather some of the world's biggest stars to raise awareness of global initiatives in aid of planetary health, but has been drastically scaled back this year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The glamorous gala aims to gather some of the most well-known stars and philanthropists across the globe in a bid to raise awareness via worldwide initiatives. 

The night is usually auction filled with many collectables, memorabilia and fine art from some of the most high-profile artists across the globe going on sale.

Proceeds will be used to help the Foundation's initiatives, which includes the development of marine protected areas, protection of threatened marine species, the mitigation of the impact of climate change and acidification on the Ocean, as well as the fight against plastic pollution.

However it's likely this year's event has been seen drastic changes to ensure social distancing can be adhered to, with many stars also donning masks as they arrived on the blue carpet.
