Ademola Lookman is joining Fulham on a season-long loan from Red Bull Leipzig for a £1.8million fee. 

The 22-year-old left Everton for Red Bull Leipzig last year in a £16.5m deal but made just 13 appearances last season.

The Bundesliga club are keen for the former England Under-21 winger to go out on loan and build up his confidence with more regular football.

RB Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche had earlier confirmed that Lookman could go out on loan.

He told German newspaper Bild: 'We are dealing with this matter, and it's possible that something will happen.

'Ademola hasn't played much, and you need playing time as a young player.'

Bild also claim the Londoner is keen on the switch
