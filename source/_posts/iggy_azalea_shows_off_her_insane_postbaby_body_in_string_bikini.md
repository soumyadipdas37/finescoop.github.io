Iggy Azalea has certainly bounced back since the birth of her first child earlier this year. 

In a recent TikTok video, the 30-year-old flaunted her flat, toned tummy and curvaceous derriere in a tiny string bikini.

The rapper didn't have an inch to pinch as she danced and gyrated around in the skimpy swimwear.

In another TikTok video, Iggy showed off her enviable pear-shaped hips and tiny waist in a tight black dress with a corset.

The hitmaker put safety first by wearing a black face mask that matched her dress.

Iggy recently denied that her incredible post-baby body was the result of plastic surgery.

She told a fan on Twitter that her toned physique was down to a healthy diet and the fact that she was already in great shape before falling pregnant.

And while that may well be true, it doesn't mean that Iggy has never gone under the knife before.

She has openly admitted to undergoing some procedures, including rhinoplasty and a breast augmentation.

The blonde bombshell has denied having butt implants, but there has been speculation that she may have undergone a Brazilian butt lift.

Plastic surgeon to the stars, Michael Salzhauer (aka Dr. Miami), who has not operated on the rapper, told Daily Mail Australia last year that Iggy's 'shape' is a dead giveaway.

'Her shape and personal history makes me think she has,' he said, adding that telltale signs of a Brazilian butt lift include: 'A very small waist and big buttocks. Also, tiny scars in the lower buttocks creases, they are usually very hard to find.' 

A Brazilian butt lift is a form of buttock augmentation, which enhances the size and shape of a patient's bottom using a fat transfer from other areas of the body.

Iggy, who is often hailed by fans for her womanly curves, previously told Sway Calloway on Sway in The Morning that her bottom is completely natural.

'Of course the butt is mine. I heard it's not a real butt, I've heard it's a number of things,' she said in 2013.

'I heard sometimes it's my underpants. I heard it's implants. All kinds of crazy things. It's my flesh, it's my butt.'

The Kream hitmaker welcomed her son, Onyx, in May. While she hasn't confirmed it, the child's father is believed to be her boyfriend, Playboi Carti.
