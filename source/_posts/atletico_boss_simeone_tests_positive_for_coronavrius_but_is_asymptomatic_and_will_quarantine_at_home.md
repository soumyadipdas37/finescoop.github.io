Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone has tested positive for Covid-19, meaning the team could be without their manager when they start the La Liga campaign in two weeks' time.

The Spanish side said the 50-year-old Argentine was asymptomatic and was currently isolating in his home after undergoing a test on Friday during the team's pre-season training camp. 

A statement from the club said: 'The first team, coaching staff and auxiliary personnel underwent tests on Friday as soon as they returned from training in Los Angeles de San Rafael after a positive test was returned by a member of the travelling party in the previous tests carried out on Thursday.

'Fortunately, he does not present any symptoms and is isolating at his home and fulfilling the quarantine after taking training with the team since last Monday.'

The La Liga season started on Saturday but Atletico are missing the first two weekends due to participating in last month's Champions League 'Final Eight' tournament.

They play their first game of the campaign at home to Granada on September 27.
