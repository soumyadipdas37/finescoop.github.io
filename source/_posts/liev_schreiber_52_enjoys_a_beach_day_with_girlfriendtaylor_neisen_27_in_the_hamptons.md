Despite rapidly approaching his 53rd birthday, he remains in great shape.

And Liev Schreiber put his fit physique on display, while enjoying a beach day with girlfriend Taylor Neisen, 27, in the Hamptons on Saturday afternoon. 

The 52-year-old actor went without a shirt as he took a dip in the refreshing ocean water.

Schreiber wore a pair of solid black swim trunks and looked to be rocking a freshly shaved head. 

He had a silver chain fastened around his neck and a matching watch on his wrist.

Schreiber's girlfriend Taylor slipped her refined curves into a black two piece suit that included a pair of high waisted bottoms and a bandeau style top.

She let her blonde hair poke out from beneath a stylish sunhat and she appeared to be wearing little to no makeup.
