The Bachelorette winner Carlin Sterritt has revealed his relationship with Angie Kent began to fall apart after he discovered she was texting runner-up Timm Hanly.

The 32-year-old personal trainer told the How to Life podcast that the pair's bond made him feel insecure, even though he pretended to be okay with it at first.

'She really cared for Tim. They were kind of messaging a little bit afterwards. I was trying to play it cool, like "it's fine, it's all good,"' Carlin began.

Despite telling Angie he he didn't mind her staying in contact with Timm, 28, Carlin's self-confidence plummeted when he discovered the texts. 

'I was trying to be nice and I was trying to do the right thing,' he said.

'And then more and more, her and Tim messaging each other it just started to really eat me away.'

After the Bachelorette finale aired, Angie went on to film Dancing with the Stars, which also caused problems in their relationship.

Carlin said her platonic friendship with her professional dance partner, Julian Caillon, didn't help with his feelings of insecurity. 

'Then she goes onto the next show, Dancing with the Stars, with this hot Italian dude and I'm like, "Oh man, this is not easy. He's a good looking dude,"' he said.

'She would train five hours a day with this guy, five days a week and then fly to Melbourne for four days.

'So I'm like, "You get to spend so much more time with this guy and I'm still feeling pretty s**t about having just watched you mack-on with all these other dudes [on The Bachelorette]."'

'I wasn't ready for it. So we had a pretty difficult run,' he added.

Sore point: Reflecting on their short-lived relationship, Carlin said it was difficult to watch Angie form connections with the other men on the show. Pictured: Angie and Timm during The Bachelorette finale

Carlin and Angie dated for about 10 months before calling it quits in early July.

Reflecting on their short-lived relationship, Carlin said it was difficult to watch Angie form connections with the other men on the show. 

He said: 'Watching it all back, it's almost as if someone has just handed you their Tinder [account] and said, "Have a scroll."'

Carlin didn't blame Angie for his insecurity, however, and told the hosts of How to Life that he was 'getting therapy' to address his problems.

The couple announced their break-up on July 1, after weeks of speculation they had quietly called it quits.

'We have not wanted to confirm until this point because there have been much bigger issues going on in the world and we've both been taking space to think about what we really want,' Angie wrote on Instagram at the time.

'Matters of the heart are extremely difficult and I'm sad to say that Carlin and I have broken up.'
