The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has previously denied being a 'secret actress', after rumours swirled she only signed up to boost her profile.

And Daily Mail Australia can now reveal that Bella's own co-stars suspected she had an ulterior motive for appearing on the dating show.

An insider said on Tuesday that several women doubted her intentions during filming because she spent so much one-on-one time with the producers.

'It was hard to compete with Bella because she spent a lot more time with producers than anyone else,' the source claimed. 

'She always seemed way too self-aware, while other girls didn't care how they were perceived [on camera].'

The insider added that Bella was 'very vague' when asked about her job in marketing, and as a consequence 'nobody really knew what she did for a living'.

They also claimed that she 'made no effort to talk to any of the girls' until the arrival of post-lockdown intruder Bec Cvilikas.

It comes just a week after Bella publicly slammed allegations she was an aspiring actress who once dreamt of moving to LA to further her career.

'I've never moved to LA, I've never wanted or tried to be an actress in Australia, never wanted or tried to get work as an actress in LA and certainly am not acting on the Bachelor,' the 25-year-old wrote on Instagram. 

Without naming names, she claimed that people had tried to 'fabricate' stories about her in order to feel 'relevant' and 'important'.

Something to hide? The insider added that Bella was 'very vague' when asked about her job in marketing, and as a consequence 'nobody really knew what she did for a living' 

'It's unfortunate that you and many other people have believed it but I can confirm -  my tears weren't acting, they were real,' she added.

Last month, talent manager Michael Beveridge claimed that Bella had once planned to move to Hollywood to pursue her dreams of stardom.

Speaking on the Friendship Rose podcast with comedian Rose Callaghan, Michael claimed: 'She said she was moving to Los Angeles. Bella wanted to be an actress, or wants to be an actress.'

He explained that Bella had been signed to an influencer management company that he used to run with his ex-girlfriend.

The Bachelor starring Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
