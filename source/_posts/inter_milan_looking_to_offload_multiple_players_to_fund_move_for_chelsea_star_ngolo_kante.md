Inter Milan are lining up a move for Chelsea star N'Golo Kante and will look to offload three players in order to fund the deal, according to reports in Italy.

Antonio Conte is desperate for a reunion with the Frenchman, having brought him to Stamford Bridge from Leicester in 2016.

Having won the Premier League title and FA Cup with Kante in his squad, Conte is intent on linking up with the midfielder once again, but will have to sell before he buys.

According to CalcioMercato, Conte will move on Joao Mario, Dalbert Henrique and Ivan Perisic in order to raise funds for their Kante bid, while Christian Eriksen, Milan Skriniar and Marcelo Brozovic are also fighting for their futures at the club.

Conte is looking to make Kante his sixth Premier League signing since becoming bos of Inter last summer. During his tenure he has signed Romelu Lukaku, Eriksen, Ashley Young, Victor Moses and Alexis Sanchez. 

While previous reports suggested that Inter were looking at a loan deal with an option to buy for £44.5million, Chelsea would be looking for nearly double that figure if they were to let go of their World Cup winning midfielder.

Boss Frank Lampard has also showed signs of wanting to keep the 29-year-old after handing him the captain's armband in the draw over Brighton last weekend.

Kante is also thought to favour staying at the club and is likely to turn down a move to Italy, according to Goal.

Following an injury-hit season under Lampard, Kante is keen to regain his place in the starting XI and help fire the Blues to some silverware, along with the club's marquee summer signings.

Chelsea have taken their summer spending to over £230m once the deal for Kai Havertz has been confirmed.

Havertz follows Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell into the club, along with the two free acquisitions of Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr.

There are six more weeks before the market closes and the Blues are still targeting a move for West Ham star Declan Rice.
