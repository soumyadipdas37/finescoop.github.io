Just nine orders for commercial aircraft were placed globally last month, making it the worst August ever. 

The figure represented a 59 per cent drop on a year ago, industry body ADS said, and a 92 per cent drop on 2018.

It underlines the scale of the crisis facing the aerospace industry as the pandemic heavily dents levels of air travel and hits demand for new aircraft. Since March, only 123 orders have been placed. 

ADS boss Paul Everitt warned that 110,000 British jobs depend on the industry and urged the Government to do more to open up air travel again. 

He said: 'A full restart is the only way to ensure the future of the UK's aerospace sector.'
