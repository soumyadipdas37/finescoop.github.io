She's a singer and model who often makes a style statement with her eye-catching ensembles.

And Pia Mia certainly turned heads with her latest look as she put on a racy display while attending the Father Foods launch party in West Hollywood on Wednesday evening. 

The 24-year-old Chamorro singer stunned in tiny denim hot pants and thigh-high shimmering pink boots as she stepped out to support Instagram sensation Kelsey Calemine at the launch of her delivery-only restaurant.

Hot stuff: Pia Mia certainly turned heads with her latest look as she put on a racy display while attending the Father Foods launch party in West Hollywood on Wednesday evening

Pia looked sensational as she teamed her shorts and boots with an aquamarine satin halterneck top, which gave a glimpse of her ample cleavage and taut midriff.

The Do It Again hitmaker added a touch of bling with gold necklaces, while she carried her essentials in a brown leather Louis Vuitton handbag.  

Pia swept her blonde tresses into a sleek bun while she covered much of her face with a black face mask.

The stunner appeared somewhat camera shy as she shielded her face as she walked down the street amid the party, which saw the likes of Madison Beer and Hailey Bieber in attendance.

Pia's appearance comes after she announced earlier this month that she had joined X-rated subscription site OnlyFans.

The singer made the announcement with a sexy Instagram post which saw her posing in skimpy lingerie, with Pia writing alongside the snap: 'Baby, check me out I’m finally free!! Only Fans'.

Keen to plug her new venture, the blonde bombshell shared a slew of skimpy snaps the following day, as she teased: 'Stuck inside come play with me on Only Fans'. 

OnlyFans is an online service that allows for public figures to charge fans a subscription to their site, where they often share content usually deemed too provocative for other social media platforms.

Much like others who run their own pages on the subscription service, Pia charges fans for access to her content in tiers – $14.99 for 30 days, $33.73 for 3 months and $62.96 for 6 months. 

Pia found fame as a singer, appearing on will.i.am‘s hit Boys & Girls and recently releasing the single, Hot. 

Pia previously sat down for a candid interview with Daily Mail Australia about how she deals with online trolls.

The social media sensation, who boasts 5.9 million Instagram followers, revealed she doesn't take negative comments to heart.

Instead, the beauty explained she focuses on the positive aspects of life by ensuring she does what makes her happy.

She explained: 'I've never really been one on social media to take things to heart. I'm on there just to share life and be positive and happy. I don't let things affect me. I do what I want and I do what makes me happy.'

Pia elaborated by claiming she isn't worried about her body image and she doesn't diet or deny herself anything she wants, whether it's Cheetos or green juice.

She confessed: 'I don't diet. I do what I want and I do what makes me happy. I exercise, but if I want to buy an entire bag of Cheetos, I'm going to, and if I want a green juice, I'll do that too. I don't like restrictions, it's not the way to live.'
