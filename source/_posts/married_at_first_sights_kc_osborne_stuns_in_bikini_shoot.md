Despite her sensational appearance, the dance instructor has admitted to struggling with body insecurities in the past.

Posting to Instagram earlier this month, KC explained that recently she lost 'too much weight' and has been working towards a 'healthy weight'. 

'To all my girls that write to me about having the perfect body as much as I am flattered, it's not true,' she began.

Stunning: KC knew how to work the camera from every angle 

'The past few months I dropped 2 much weight and it was not intentional. I have been eating a lot more to get back to my healthy weight! I am also back dancing so my abs are looking solid.' 

The for reality star then pleaded with her followers not to 'compare themselves' to people on Instagram and admitted that she also has 'insecurities' about her weight. 

'As long as you are healthy it's honestly all that matters,' she added.

Toned: Due to her profession as a dance teacher, KC looked incredibly fit and toned

'I am naturally very petite but when I drop weight I also have insecurities about my size... We are all born different shapes and sizes.

She added: 'We have to embrace that. Eat well, do some exercise and do NOT compare on Instagram because no one is perfect.'

Just one week earlier, KC's ex, Michael Goonan, reflected on the couple's decision to end their relationship on the podcast Reality TV & Me.

Chilly? At one point, the former reality star looked a little cold

He explained because of the lockdown restrictions in Melbourne, he and KC were constantly with each other and rarely had time apart.

'Amplify that with lockdown, you develop a relationship a lot faster and you develop a lot stronger feelings than you would in a normal environment,' Michael said of his relationship with KC.

The eighth season of Married At First Sight is currently filming and is expected to premiere early next year.
