After closing at 5940 last night, the FTSE 100 index got off to a positive start this morning, and was up around 0.85 per cent in early trading. 

Melrose Industries has confirmed it plans to make a 'significant' number of job cuts at its GKN Aerospace business.

FTSE 100-listed Melrose suffered a £560million loss in the first half of the year, which is considerably more than the £131million loss seen at the same point a year ago.

Melrose said consultations with affected staff and unions were already 'well underway', with the board adding that GKN Aerspace looked set to enjoy a 'better performance' next year.
