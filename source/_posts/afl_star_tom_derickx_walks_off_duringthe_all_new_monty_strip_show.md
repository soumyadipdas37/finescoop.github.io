On Sunday's episode of The All New Monty: Guys & Gals, Tom Derickx let his nerves get the better off him - and he walked off during a strip routine. 

The AFL star was set to get his gear off during a dress rehearsal for the charity event, with the men performing for the women's team. 

However, midway through the routine, the 32-year-old stopped and simply walked away.

Before the dress rehearsal started, he had admitted: 'I don't feel comfortable getting my kit off in front of everyone. 

'I think it's a little bit too early to start doing it but I'm here for one reason and that's embarrass myself.' 

However when it came down to the big moment, he wasn't able to go through with it - even though at this stage, the men were only removing their shirts.

'The girls were literally two metres away,' he said sadly afterwards. 'It was pretty overwhelming.' 

While the rest of the men finished the performance, Tom admitted he was not ready to face the nudity the show requires.   

'That was tough. The clothes coming off is something I probably have to start wrapping my head around,' he said.

Choreographer Todd McKenney worried that Tom could choke on the big night itself, when the men are due to strip fully naked. 

Todd said: 'I think Tom had a mini freak out. I think it became a bit real for him. He's new at performing.

'I now have to ask myself whether on the night, when he has to be completely nude, whether he's gonna crumble'.
