Charlize Theron has remained single, since ending her relationship with Sean Penn in 2015.   

During her appearance on Thursday's episode of The Drew Barrymore Show, the Oscar-winning actress opened up about navigating her dating life and raising daughters, Jackson, 8, and August, 5.

'I haven't dated anybody for over five years,' the 45-year-old star revealed, while noting she is still 'open' to going on dates when her pals suggest potential partners.

While she hasn't ruled out the idea of a new relationship, Theron admitted her next man has 'to come with a lot of game.'

'Not the kind of game that we think of, the kind of game where my life is really good so you better be able to bring that and maybe better because I just won't accept anything less,' Theron told Barrymore on a video call. 

She continued, 'I can honestly say this, on my life, I don't feel lonely.'

'Once I had my children, it's not that it replaces something, or that it makes you less interested in something else,' she said. 'It's a lot of work to be a parent. Part of that is at the end of the day I get to bed and I think, 'Oh my God, I wouldn't want this day to be any different.'  

Theron and Penn, 59, were reportedly together from 2013 to 2015 according to People. 

In June, she set the record straight on her former relationship, after Howard Stern asked her if they had been engaged.

'I can honestly say this, on my life, I don't feel lonely,' she said in the interview, after gushing about being a mom

'What? That's not true. no. I did not 'almost get married to Sean', that's such bullsh*t,' Theron responded. 'No, we dated, that was literally all we did, we dated.' 

She continued, 'It was a relationship, for sure. We were definitely exclusive, but it was for barely a year. We never moved in. I was never going to marry him. It was nothing like that.'

When Stern, 66, asked the Mad Max: Fury Road star if she ever wanted to walk down the aisle, Theron said, 'I never wanted to get married. That's never been something that's important to me.'

The pair were friends for years, Charlize claimed in a Vogue interview in 2014.

'It just kind of naturally happened, and before I knew it, I was in something that was making my life better - the people who really love me can see the effect it has had on me,' she told Vogue at the time.

Before dating the Mystic River star, she previously had a long-term relationship with actor Stuart Townsend, who she met on the set of the 2002 movie Trapped.  

The pair dated for nine years, before calling it quits in January 2010.

Just like Theron, Barrymore also revealed she has not been on a date, since 2015, after her painful divorce from Will Kopelman. 

Earlier this week, she explained on her talk show that 'for the past five years' she hasn't had 'the bandwidth' for a new relationship. 

She and Kopelman were married from 2012 until 2016 and share two daughters - Olive, seven, and Frankie, six.
