Jose Mourinho was caught short last night as he found the goalposts were five centimetres too low before his Tottenham side’s 3-1 Europa League win over Shkendija of North Macedonia. 

The goalkeepers noticed the flaw in the warm-up and alerted Mourinho, who said: ‘I am not a goalkeeper but when I spread my arms I know the difference.’ 

Goals from Erik Lamela, Son Heung-min and Harry Kane sealed victory for Spurs, who will host Maccabi Haifa in the final play-off round next Thursday.
