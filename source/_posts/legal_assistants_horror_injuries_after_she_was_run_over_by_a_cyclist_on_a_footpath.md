A Melbourne woman is facing huge medical bills after her face was smashed when she was struck from behind by a cyclist.

Legal assistant Danae Lomen, 24, suffered a fractured palate, multiple fractures to her jaw, a fractured right arm and four teeth were knocked out when the cyclist crashed into her on a shared pathway. 

'I hit the concrete face first and it was a lot of blood. I'd lost consciousness, it was quite traumatic,' Ms Lomen told A Current Affair.

The 24-year-old is now off work and said she faces dental bills of at least $25,000 as well as tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills.

She can't access compensation through Victoria's Traffic Accident Commission because collisions between cyclists and pedestrians are not covered. 

The Transport Accident Act 1986 defines a 'transport accident' as 'an incident directly caused by the driving of a motor car or motor vehicle, a railway train or a tram'. 

Ms Lomen's sister, Jessica Arias, was stunned to learn there was no compensation available for her sister. 

'There is no system in place. There's no insurance fees, there's no registration for cyclists to prevent this from happening to someone in the future,' she said.

'Now she's going to either end up in massive amounts of debt or just have to live with no front teeth.'
