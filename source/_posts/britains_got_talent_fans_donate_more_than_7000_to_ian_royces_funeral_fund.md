Britain's Got Talent fans have donated more than £7,000 to the comedian Ian Royce's funeral fund. 

Ian passed away aged 51 after he had served as the warm-up act on various ITV shows for 13 years. He died from 'severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure'. 

The fundraising page was set up by his daughter Roxanne who wrote on the GoFundMe site that her father 'was a funny, kind hearted and loved man who felt at home on a stage making everyone laugh'.

Along with other generous donations, Piers Morgan donated £640 to Ian's funeral fund.

The Good Morning Britain host, 55, wrote 'RIP Roycey, and thanks for all the laughs' on the donation page.

The presenter fondly remembered working with the comedian, who he called 'Roycey', and said he was 'the best funniest warm-up guy there was', while ITV's Loose Women also paid an emotional tribute to the star.  

Piers said: 'Very sad news I heard from his daughter Roxanne, probably the most famous person you may not have heard of, but he was famous in the industry.

'He was the best funniest warm up guy there was. Such a thankless task in so many ways. Roycey was the best I've ever worked with, he did BGT, he did the American one when I went over there. He did almost every one of my Life Stories shows.

'He was funny, he had a lot of demons which if you'd followed him on Twitter you will know. But he had a zest for life, he was a hilariously funny guy and he also had a great love for his daughter Roxanne who let me know yesterday.' 

Piers also took to his Twitter to post an emotional tribute after the news broke.

He penned: 'RIP Ian 'Roycey' Royce. Funniest warm-up man in showbiz and a legend in the TV industry. 

'Worked with him on ⁦ @BGT , ⁦@AGT ⁩ & most of my Life Stories shows. Great guy, very loyal friend, & such a proud dad to his daughter Roxanne. Thanks for all the laughs mate.'

It was revealed on September 1 that the Britain's Got Talent warm-up man died from 'severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure'.

The compère, who entered rehab in October for treatment for alcoholism and sex addiction, 'was in no pain' as he tragically passed away, according to his daughter.

The statement read: 'It is with our greatest regret that we have to tell you all that Ian has passed away today from severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure. 

'He was in no pain and was surrounded by friends and family. He put up a good fight but is in a better place now.'

Tribute: Piers also took to his Twitter to post an emotional tribute after the news broke 

Simon Cowell's company Syco released a statement to MailOnline, which read: 'Our thoughts and love are with Roycey's family at this extremely difficult time.'

Reacting to the news on Twitter, Ant and Dec said: 'So sorry to hear this news... he was a legendary character and will not be forgotten.'

They further paid tribute in a follow-up statement, in which they said: 'We are sorry to hear of the passing of Ian 'Roycey' Royce.

'He was an integral part of the #BGT team for many years. Our thoughts are with his beloved Roxy and all his family. RIP Roycey. We'll never forget you. X'

Ian, who also worked on X Factor, entered rehab last year after celebrities including Simon and Ant and Dec helped pay towards his treatment.

Thanking his friends and fans for their support on in November, Ian took to Twitter to share that he had successfully completed his 28 day stay in The Priory and would be continuing his treatment abroad. 

TV hosts Ant and Dec reportedly donated £5,000 to help fund his stay in rehab.

They were believed to have joined forces with Simon and Robbie Williams to aid Ian's battle with alcoholism, after presenter Ant, 44, checked into rehab for his own drink and drug addiction.
