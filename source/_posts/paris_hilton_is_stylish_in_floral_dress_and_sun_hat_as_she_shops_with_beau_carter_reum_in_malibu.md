The couple were snapped out and about in Malibu on Sunday as they ran some errands.

Prior to meeting Reum, Paris had been engaged to actor Chris Zylka.

She and Reum have been dating since about April 2019 and in an interview with Vogue Australia earlier this year, the former Simple Life star said she felt 'so happy' and 'so blessed' to have found the VEEV Spirits co-founder with whom she's been quarantining during the coronavirus pandemic.

'We both are business people, so we do our work during the day and then at night we cook together and watch movies and play with the puppy,' she said.

'It's just been an amazing time to be together and I'm really enjoying it.'

The one: In July, Paris tweeted this throwback photo of herself with Reum, adding 'For the two of us, home isn’t a place. It’s a person. And we’re finally home'

Paris recently debuted her new YouTube documentary This Is Paris in which she details how her parents arranged for her to be taken to a boarding school for troubled teens when she was 16. 

She was placed in Utah's Provo Canyon School where she remained until she was 18-years old and where, she claims, she was beaten, drugged and placed in solitary confinement without a blanket or food.

'All it did was give me trust issues, PTSD. I didn’t deserve to go there,' the socialite explained in an interview on Drew Barrymore's new daytime chat show.

As to what prompted her parents' actions, Paris explained: 'My mom and dad were just very strict and sheltered when I lived in LA. I wasn’t allowed to go on dates, couldn’t wear makeup, couldn’t go to a school dance. They just didn’t want me to grow up.'

She went on: 'Then I moved to New York and that’s when my life changed and I just was sneaking out at night and going to clubs and ditching school but not doing anything terrible, just wanting to go out at night and that really scared my parents because they were so protective.'

Drama: Paris recently debuted her new YouTube documentary This Is Paris and in an appearance on Drew Barrymore's new daytime chat show, she spoke about being traumatized after her parents sent her to a boarding school for troubled teens in Utah  

In the spotlight: Paris hosted an outdoor screening of the documentary in LA on September 14 and has revealed she has PTSD stemming from the abuse she suffered as a teen
