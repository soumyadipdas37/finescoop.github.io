An Australian mother-of-two has shared images of her incredibly organised home office, impressing hundreds on social media.

Mum Jessica purchased multiple stationery drawers and containers from The Reject Shop and made laminated labels herself.  

'Hands down the best design decision we made and an organiser's paradise with shelves galore, power points to hide devices away and free up bench space and all hidden away by a closed door,' she posted on Facebook.

She explained that she likes to keep such an organised space so she saves time when looking for items.

Mum Jessica purchased multiple stationary drawers and containers from The Reject Shop and made laminated labels herself

The images posted depict several stationary drawers and boxes that have each been individually labelled according to the contents in each container.

Some of the labels read 'party', 'Christmas', 'Halloween', 'craft' and 'learning'.

The 34-litre large carry storage containers are priced at $9.50 each, while the stationary drawers cost don't exceed $15.

'I made the labels - they are just laminated print outs attached with Velcro dots,' Jessica said.
