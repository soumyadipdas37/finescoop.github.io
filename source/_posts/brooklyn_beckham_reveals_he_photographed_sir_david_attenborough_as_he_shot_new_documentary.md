Brooklyn Beckham has revealed that he was tasked with photographing Sir David Attenborough as he shot his new environmental documentary, A Life On Our Planet.

The 21-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham took to Instagram on Saturday evening to make the revelation, as he admitted to feeling 'nervous' about the project.

Sharing snaps of the natural historian, Brooklyn wrote: 'I am excited to share these photos at last. I was so lucky to be invited by @wwf_uk to join @davidattenborough as he filmed scenes for his new film A Life on Our Planet a while ago.

'Can’t believe I got to photograph him. I was really nervous but he was so relaxed and kind to me a true gentleman.

'He just loved that we were all there and wants young people to learn more about the planet so we can do what we can to save it. Will never forget this trip. Thank you so much Sir David can’t wait to watch the film ❤️.'

Two of the snaps showed the 94-year-old legendary broadcaster standing in rolling plains as he peered into the camera lens.

Responding to the post, Brooklyn's 25-year-old Nicola Peltz wrote: 'One of the most beautiful photos I've ever seen. I'm so proud of you Brooklyn.'

Brooklyn's shots are the latest additions to his growing portfolio of enviably high profile work, including shooting Sophie Turner, a Burberry campaign, and his dad David's sunglasses campaign. He has also interned with Rankin.

Over the summer, he took two snaps in his own photoshoot for ICON magazine.

Meanwhile, in July 2018 Brooklyn quit his New York photography course at the world-renowned Parsons School of Design because he 'missed' his family in the UK.

He told pals months before that he wanted to leave – according to the Mirror, but decided to stick it out to the end of term.

An insider told the publication: 'It sounds as if he was truly homesick and was feeling lonely out there.

'He adores his family, in the end it was the lure to come back to them all that swung it – and the prospect of a terrific internship.

'Victoria is absolutely delighted at the news and couldn't contain herself when it was all coming to plan – to have Brooklyn back under the same roof is a dream come true for her.'

The source said Victoria was 'thrilled' at Brooklyn's return, adding: 'She was telling pals she couldn't believe how much she missed him and hated to be separated from him.'
