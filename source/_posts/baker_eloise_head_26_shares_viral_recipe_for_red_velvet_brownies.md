A video from 'Instagram famous' baker Eloise Head showing viewers a simple way to make red velvet brownies has gone viral, with hundreds calling it her best recipe ever.

The 26-year-old, who is the founder of FitWaffle Kitchen, an Instagram page dedicated to decadent desserts that take just a few minutes to prepare, has amassed 55,400 likes on her latest clip since it was shared on Friday.

In it, the amateur chef from London whips up a batch of brownies with basic supermarket ingredients like butter, sugar, eggs, flour, vanilla extract and white chocolate chips, along with food colouring to give the treats a striking ruby hue.

Ms Head said while she's a 'big fan' of the cream cheese icing, it's entirely optional - the brownies still taste delicious without.

To make the brownies, whisk the melted butter with granulated sugar, then add the egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract and red food colouring.

Next, add flour and cocoa powder and fold in gently. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice, stir once, then add the white chocolate chips, folding them into the mixture to ensure they're evenly spread throughout.

Once well folded, spoon the mixture into a baking tray lined with parchment paper and leave in an oven set to 160 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes before turning your attention to the cream cheese icing.

To make it, simply whisk butter and cream cheese before adding vanilla extract and icing sugar, sieved in gradually.

Then spoon the mix onto the cooled brownies and smooth until even, before cutting the tray into slices and enjoying for up to three days.

The tutorial drew hundreds of delighted responses, with many tagging their friends begging them to make the brownies at home.

'Please, please someone do this for me,' one woman wrote.

Others praised Ms Head's whisking technique which created perfectly smooth icing. 

'I always struggle with cream cheese frosting going lumpy – yours looks so nice and smooth and thick,' said one.

It's the latest of Ms Head's simple recipes to become a viral sensation, following a wildly popular video on Nutella brownies with a marbled chocolate top.

Ms Head - who says the treats are 'quick and easy to make', even for beginners - uses 90g of plain biscuits, 250g of icing sugar, 120g of butter, 200g of white chocolate and 300g of the iconic chocolate and hazelnut spread.

'These are super sweet, but not overpowering with Nutella flavour,' she wrote in the caption, adding they are subtly 'moreish' and 'addictive' for anyone with a sweet tooth.

First, Ms Head mixes the crushed biscuits with melted butter and icing sugar, then adds 250g of Nutella until fully combined.

Next, she spoons the mix into a dish lined with baking paper, pressing down until flat.

Then she melts white chocolate in the microwave and pours it over the base, before melting the remaining 50g of Nutella and drizzling it on top.

Using the back of a palette knife, Ms Head swirls the chocolate liquid into a decorative pattern and leaves the tray in the fridge to set.
