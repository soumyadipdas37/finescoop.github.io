With breathtaking scenery and glorious weather almost all year round, the Atlantic coast of France is home to medieval landmarks and magnificent vineyards. 

And on this eight-day luxury river cruise along the Garonne, Dordogne and Gironde, you’ll experience the region’s full flavour – with one of the UK’s most popular chefs, James Martin.

The chef, who hosts his own ITV show – Saturday Morning With James Martin – says his early trips to the Bordeaux region are what cemented his passion for food and set him on the path to a culinary career. 

During an oyster and wine tasting at Cussac-Fort-Medoc, James will tell tales of trying his first croissant during his formative years working in kitchens in the area. Pictured are mist-covered vineyards in the region
