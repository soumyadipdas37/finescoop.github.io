Khloe Kardashian is reminiscing over her recent dreamy getaway to Turks and Caicos for Kylie Jenner's 23rd birthday.

On Tuesday, Khloe, 36, shared a cute snap of her daughter True, two, kissing as they posed on an idyllic white sandy beach by the clear blue ocean. 

Showing off her incredible bikini body in the picture, Khloe wowed wearing a zebra-print two-piece, with her hair tied back in braids.

Accompanying her on the trip, was her on-again boyfriend and True's father, NBA player Tristan Thompson. 

While Khloe and Tristan have remained tight-lipped about their reunion, Scott Disick recently let it slip in an Instagram comment last week. 

The Talentless CEO left a comment under a sexy snap of Khloe, calling 29-year-old Tristan a 'lucky man.'

A rep for Khloe had 'no comment' when DailyMail.com asked about Scott's mention that the couple is back on at the time. 

After a tumultuous on-again-off-again relationship, Khloe and Tristan had broken up for good following his 2019 cheating scandal with Kardashian family friend Jordyn Woods. 

However, earlier this month People cited a source who said, 'She loves having him around. He has the best relationship with True, and he has been amazing to Khloe too. They are very much together and Khloe is beyond happy.'

The source added, 'They have been living in kind of a bubble and Khloe enjoys it.' 

The insider claimed that not only was the reality star was back together with NBA player, but they went so far as to add that she was 'beyond happy' and hoped 'that Tristan has changed'. 

Khloe and the Cleveland Cavaliers player have had plenty of time to work on their issues recently. Thompson had actually been living with Khloe and True in Calabasas  during the coronavirus pandemic.

The reality star recently gushed about how helpful Tristan has been while they've quarantined together with their daughter, and is appreciative of the extra support.

'So many people don't understand it, but I lead with love and we put our child first,' she told People last month. 'If you have that mindset, everything else follows easily. We have a family together.' 

She added: 'Tristan and I needed that time to heal and I needed time to go through my emotions. But now he's literally one of my best friends.' 

It's been a long road for the celebrity couple. Tristan and Khloe first went public with their romance in September 2016 and she finalized her divorce from ex-husband Lamar Odom.

All seemed well in December 2017 when Khloe announced the happy news that she was pregnant and moved to Cleveland to be with her beau.
