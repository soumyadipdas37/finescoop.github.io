Bella Varelis and intruder Bec Cvilikas are two of the frontrunners on The Bachelor this year.

But a new video indicates that neither one of the two will win Locky Gilbert's heart, meaning that Irena Srbinovska is most likely Locky's final girl.

In a video shared to the Bachie Funny meme account, Bec and Bella are shown enjoying a viewing party of The Bachelor with their friends and family.

Surprise: Bec Cvilikas (pictured) and Bella Varelis held a Bachelor viewing party this week, leading some to believe that neither of them will end up with Locky Gilbert 

While Bella herself isn't shown in the video, she is tagged.

If Bella and Bec are close enough to be friends and have viewing parties together, it indicates that they may not have ended up with Locky. 

'Intruder Bec watching last night's ep with Bella and Bella's friends and family,' Bachie Funny captioned the video.

'A lot of you are messaging to say they now live together. Wouldn't be doing that if either had won hey,' they added.

Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, are set for a fiery confrontation as the ladies head back to the mansion on Thursday's episode of The Bachelor.

In the latest teaser for the series, the two frontrunners clash in a bitter argument seemingly over their feelings for Locky Gilbert.

'Irena, I don't trust you anymore, I'm sorry,' Bella tells the clearly agitated nurse, who says she also also no longer 'trusts' Bella.

'Great. Friendship done. I'm over your bullsh*t to be honest. You're a manipulative little bi*ch,' Bella tells her, as she does a walk off.

Bella's animosity towards nurse Irena is on full display as she confesses the nurse 'grinds my gears' after seeing her at the cocktail party.

'I'm not stoked to see her,' Bella says.

Irena seems perplexed by the sudden acrimonious behaviour, with the two women previously friends in the mansion.

'Bella decided that our friendship was done,' Irena says, with her then shown saying: 'It's hurt me so bad.'
