An Oklahoma woman pulled over by police told the officer she had 'to go poop' before fleeing the scene and leading them on a 70mph car chase. 

Emily Jean Owings Sindt, 28, was arrested last Tuesday morning in Enid after being stopped by officer Geoffrey McBride for not wearing her seatbelt. 

Police body cam footage shows as Owings Sindt, identified by her medical marijuana card, explains it is her birthday and she needed the toilet. 

After speeding from the scene she was eventually stopped again by officers and arrested, this time asking them: 'Can I poop in your car, man?'

Emily Jean Owings Sindt was arrested last Tuesday morning in the city of Enid

Footage shows as Owings Sindt says it is her birthday and she needs the toilet. 'But I have to poop so bad. It’s my f***ing birthday', she tells officers

Owings Sindt, whose license is revoked, is said to have led officers on a pursuit 'for several blocks, reaching speeds of 70 mph in a 30 mph zone, past an elementary school and through an intersection with a 4-way stop' police said.

She was eventually taken in custody and booked on complaints of eluding, reckless driving, driving under suspension, no seat belt, no insurance and possession of drug paraphernalia.  

Footage shows as a tearful Owings Sindt tells the officer running checks: 'But I have to poop so bad. It’s my birthday. It’s my f***ing birthday.'

 'Why won’t you just let me go?', she asks, adding: 'But can I please go home and go poop?'

The officer then tells Owings Sindt she has 'warrants in Woods County and they are coming to get you'. 

She replies 'no they are not, f*** you guys', before speeding from the scene. 

After being arrested and asking to use the police patrol car as a toilet one officer replies: 'You could’ve already been on your way to jail.'

Owings Sindt answers: 'Yeah, but not pooping.'

'Everybody poops, we know, but that’s no reason to commit a felony', cops said

 In a statement police said: 'A check with dispatch found Owings Sindt’s license was revoked and she had a warrant out of Woods and Grant counties. 

'While waiting for this information, McBride saw the woman bouncing up and down in her seat and heard her yell several times more that she had to “poop.”' 

'Owings Sindt then revved her engine, cursed the officers at the scene and sped away with her tires squealing.' 

Police say they also found a glass meth pipe with a burnt residue inside her car. 

They added: 'Everybody poops, we know, but that’s no reason to commit a felony and put in danger the lives of officers, other motorists and pedestrians in the area.'
