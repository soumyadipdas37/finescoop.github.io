Aston Villa have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth's Callum Wilson.

Wilson has been on Villa's striker shortlist for this window along with Brentford's Ollie Watkins.

Villa, though, have struggled to make progress in their attempts to reunite Watkins with his former Griffin Park boss Dean Smith and are ready to pursue a move for Wilson.

Brentford are holding out for £25m for Watkins, scorer of 26 goals for the Championship play-off runners up, compared to Villa's initial £18m valuation.

Newcastle are also making a push for Wilson, 28, while Crystal Palace are monitoring the situation too.

Bournemouth have lost defender Nathan Ake to Manchester City and goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to Sheffield United following their relegation to the Championship.

But they are determined to retain as many of their key men as possible and also have no intention of selling anyone who does leave on the cheap.

However Wilson is keen to remain in the top flight with a view to earning a place in England's squad for next summer's Euros.
