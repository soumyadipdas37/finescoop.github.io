Piers Morgan has embarked on a strict new diet plan in a bid to shape up after a summer of over indulging on wine and cheese. 

The 55-year-old TV presenter has revealed he's employed personal trainer Sarah Lindsay and reduced his alcohol intake to help shed the pounds. 

Speaking about his new diet, Piers - who is married to journalist Celia Walden - said: 'I'm going to see a new personal trainer, and unfortunately Celia's taken it all quite seriously.

'So suddenly it's all the good stuff's gone and all the kale's come in and the quinoa and vegetables. A lot of vegetables. A lot of salmon.

'A lot less Bordeaux - I'm down to one glass a night. And, well, during the summer, a lot of cheese went down my gullet, and and it could stretch to a bottle of red. Quite comfortably ... Depending on the quality, and maybe a little more.'

Piers jetted off on his annual holiday to France this summer where he regularly shared pictures enjoying lavish lunches and the odd glass of wine.

His diet revelations come after Piers threw his support behind Ashley Banjo, amid the fallout over his group Diversity's Black Lives Matter routine on Britain's Got Talent last weekend.

As Ofcom complaints soared to 15,500 following the performance, which featured portrayed a policeman kneeling on the dancer's neck, Piers lauded the routine.

Taking to Twitter on Thursday, the former Britain's Got Talent judge wrote: 'I thought it was great. Ignore the haters, Ashley. Proud of you.'

Diversity's routine, which narrated the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May, had already polarised fans of the mainstream talent show last Saturday night due to its political stance. 

An Ofcom spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline on Friday afternoon that BGT has received 15,500 complaints so far. On Monday the figure stood at 1,121. 

The representative added: 'We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'

Piers is also preparing to release a new book called 'Wake Up: Why The World Has Gone Nuts'.

The Good Morning Britain star has teased details of what fans can expect from the project.

Speaking to The Sun newspaper, he explained: 'The book's about everything from gender, to race, to identity, politics, to sexism, to feminism, to masculinity: all these things, we've all got to get a collective grip.

'So I'm hoping the book, when it comes out, will wake people up and at the very least, let us have a debate without everyone throwing their toys out the pram.

'It's got to the stage where the majority of people are now too scared to offer any opinion about anything, particularly if you're in any form of public life.

'We had a story on 'GMB' this week about a hair salon in Gloucestershire, where the owner wasn't allowed to apply for a 'happy' stylist because it was discriminatory to unhappy people. I mean, f*** off! What is the world coming to?'
