Florida veterinarians had their hands full when bringing in Bob the 660-pound alligator for an X-ray. 

The 38-year-old reptile that lives at the St Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park in Gainesville was transported earlier this month to the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine for tests after experiencing pain in his right rear leg. 

Staff at the alligator farm strapped the scaly patient to a long wooden board, tied his massive jaws shut and covered his eyes with a towel to spare him stress.

Bob was then wheeled on a gurney inside the radiology department to undergo X-rays

Once Bob arrived at the veterinary clinic on the campus of the University of Florida - home of the Gators football team - he was placed on a gurney and tightly secured with straps, allowing staff to wheel him in for radiographs, reported CBS Miami. 

Officials with UF veterinary medicine said the tests have determined that Bob has a bone infection called osteomyelitis.

The middle-aged reptile has been prescribed pain relief medications and antibiotics for the infection, which zookeepers on the alligator farm have been administering to him inside dead rats. 

'For me, it’s a great pleasure and a great privilege to be able to work on these animals,' Darryl Heard, UF associate professor of zoological medicine, told WCJB. 'In particular such a large animal and also to be able to work with them safely.'

Bob is being fed medicine inside his favorite snack - dead rats - and is said to be on the mend 

Days after his trip to the doctor, Bob is said to be doing better.

'What about Bob,' the farm tweeted on September 8. 'He is doing great! Taking his medicine like a perfect patient. Bob has been back in the Lagoon, eating his pain relievers and antibiotics inside his favorite snacks (rats!). #ChompChomp #GoGators #StAugustine.'
