Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis has confirmed that Everton's move to sign Brazilian midfielder Allan will be announced imminently. 

The Toffees have agreed a £24million deal for the Napoli man who was also wanted by Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid.

The 29-year-old worked alongside Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti when the Italian was in charge at the Serie A club for 18 months between 2018 and 2019.

Everton are set to complete a deal for Brazilian midfielder Allan, says Aurelio De Laurentiis

The Napoli president confirmed that Allan's £24million move to Goodison Park will be finalised

And according to Italian sports journalist Fabrizio Romano, De Laurentiis said: 'Allan is joining Everton. The deal will be announced soon.'

The Brazil international has been at Everton since 2015 and has made 212 appearances in all competitions. 

Allan was part of the side that won this season's Coppa Italia, as Genarro Gattuso's side beat Italian league champions Juventus on penalties in the final.

Meanwhile, Ancelotti is looking to finalise a deal for another former player in James Rodriguez. 

The Colombia international was part of Ancelotti's Real Madrid side in the 2014-15 season and is looking to bring the 29-year-old on an initial loan deal. 

Real Madrid know that James has only one year left on his contract at the Santiago Bernabeu but are looking to offload the midfielder's high wages. 

Ancelotti also wants to sign Real Madrid's James Rodiguez who he has worked with before

Everton are looking to sign him on a temporary deal before offering him a two-year contract this time next year. 

James made just 14 appearances for Zinedine Zidane's side last term, scoring just once. 

He spent the previous two seasons on loan under Ancelotti at German giants Bayern Munich.
