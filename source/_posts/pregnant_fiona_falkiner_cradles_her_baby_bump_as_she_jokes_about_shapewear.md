'Fi is going first because she is older': In an interview with The Daily Telegraph not long ago, Hayley said she hopes to carry a baby once Fiona has given birth

Not long ago, Fiona spoke about her 'traumatic' and 'lonely' IVF journey in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. 

She told the newspaper: 'It is you and your body against all odds. Women don't really talk about it until after the fact. It can be really quite traumatic.'

Hayley also revealed that she, too, hopes to carry a baby once Fiona has given birth.

'Fi is going first because she is older. I really want to carry a bub too but Fi will go first just because of the body clock on fertility, so her going first is best,' she said. 

Happily ever after! Fiona and Hayley announced their engagement in April 2019, after 10 months of dating
