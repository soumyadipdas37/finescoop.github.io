Molly-Mae couldn't hide her delight as she shared a shirtless snap of her boyfriend hanging out at home in their Cheshire pad.

Molly-Mae said Tommy knew she had been feeling low so decided to surprise her, and said: 'Thought I wasn't going to see him for 6 weeks but he knew how miserable I was so he came home and surprised me for the night.'

The reality star admitted she thought it was a burglar and said: 'Literally  died when I heard someone buzzing the gate at this time of night. Don't know how we thought we'd last six when we can't even last two days ffs.'

Aside from distance, Molly-Mae recently revealed she's stuck in an angry ongoing dispute with her elderly neighbours. Molly-Mae and Tommy moved into their £1.3 million apartment in Cheshire back in June, but have struggled to settle. 

In a series of Instagram Stories, she confessed that she's too 'scared' to use the communal bins in the building after clashing with her neighbours about recycling. 

She began by sharing a picture of a mountain of cardboard boxes in her hallway that she had been unable to clear due to the row.   

She captioned the post: 'One weeks worth of cardboard. Our neighbours hate us (me) so we are too scared to use the bins here. Skip run it is.'

The YouTuber began: 'Right excuse the fact that I look like a Stig of the Dump this morning but all of you want the juicy gossip on why the neighbours hate us so guess what I'm going to give it to you... 

'It's going to be a massive let down by the way. Like it's a really boring story but here we go anyway. So it's all to do with recycling! Told you. Yeah told you it was going to be a massive let down.'
