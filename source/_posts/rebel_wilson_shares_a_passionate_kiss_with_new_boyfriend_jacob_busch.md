Just days after going public with their relationship, Rebel Wilson shared a series of loved-up photos with her new boyfriend, multi-millionaire Jacob Busch.  

In images posted to Instagram, the 40-year-old actress shared a passionate kiss with her new beau.

The couple were seen lying next to each other, with Rebel planting a kiss on the 29-year-old heir to the Anheuser-Busch brewing dynasty, which produces Budweiser beer.

In a second photo, the Pitch Perfect star cuddled up to her handsome new boyfriend, who is estimated to be worth a whopping $140million.

While the couple is yet to address their fledgling relationship, they made headlines last week when they debuted their romance in Monaco.

Stepping out together for the Monte-Carlo Gala For Planetary Health last Thursday, Rebel and Jacob happily posed together on the red carpet.

On Friday, the Australian actress also shared a photo of herself sidling up to Jacob as they posed in front of a helicopter with fellow actresses Helen Mirren and Kate Beckinsale.

The couple has reportedly been dating for a few months, and stayed on in Monaco to enjoy a romantic holiday together.

According to a report by People last Thursday, they were introduced by a mutual friend last year, but their relationship only turned romantic after Rebel returned to the USA after quarantining in Australia earlier this year.

'They are officially boyfriend and girlfriend. He's a gentleman, has very old school manners and treats her well,' a source told People.

'He is also very health conscious and they've been motivating each other with their health journeys.'

Prior to dating Rebel, Jacob was in a relationship with Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, who is 30 years his senior.
