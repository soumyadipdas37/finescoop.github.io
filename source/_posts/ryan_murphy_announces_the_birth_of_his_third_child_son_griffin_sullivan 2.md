Ryan Murphy and husband David Miller have welcomed a third child.

The Glee co-creator, 58, shared the happy news to his Instagram Tuesday, posting a heart-melting photo of his older boys Logan, seven, and Ford, five, holding their new brother close.

Griffin Sullivan Miller Murphy was born on August 18, weighing in at six-pounds 13 ounces, according to Ryan's caption.

Ryan revealed that he and his husband of eight years were having another child back in June, telling Architectural Digest: 'We are expecting another baby, a boy, in August' and anticipating an 'attack of color and Legos and bright Magna-Tiles' coming to his house any moment.

The American Horror Story creator and his photographer husband's bundle of joy comes after years of focusing on son Ford's health. 

This past November Ryan revealed that the five-year-old was 'cancer-free' after being diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a type of cancer typically found in the adrenal glands - in October 2018.
