Louise Thompson has described the moment she felt paralysed with fear as she suffered from a panic attack in central London on Monday. 

The former Made In Chelsea star, 30, returned to Instagram on Wednesday to detail how she 'couldn't stop crying' and felt like 'I couldn't breathe'.

Louise said the panic attack was triggered with feeling overwhelmed with work, social media and the 'unfamiliar emotions' and uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic.

In a lengthy post, the fitness guru wrote: 'I went silent on here again- no insta storying etc because I needed a break...

'I was OVERWHELMED with work and had a panic attack in the middle of central London on Monday. I couldn't stop crying and I couldn't breathe.

'I couldn't make sense of anything.

Emotional: 'I was OVERWHELMED with work and had a panic attack in the middle of central London on Monday', she said: (pictured at the Corinthia hotel on Monday) 

'It was v awkward but I didn't care about my surroundings, I just needed to get home. Lots of things came to a head and I couldn't make sense of them all at the same time.

'I took half a day off and just slept. I don't feel guilty about it, I did what I needed to do. And as my dad has recently been drumming into me: health ALWAYS comes first.'

Louise went on to explain how being self employed and not having a 'structure, routine and putting pressure on herself' took it's toll and described feeling uncertain about her future during lockdown.  

She added: 'It's difficult to forecast and difficult to plan for the future. I'm sure lots of you have been experiencing unfamiliar emotions.

'Anyway I really enjoyed a short break, also it was AMAZING how much I was able to achieve yesterday not being on my phone AT ALL. I got into really deep focused work, was much more connected.'

Louise then encouraged her followers to break the scrolling Instagram cycle and focus on themselves. 

Earlier this month, Louise admitted to being 'really unhappy for 10 YEARS' during an Instagram Q and A.  

A follower asked Louise 'What was the point you felt you wanted/needed to go on your self care / fitness journey?'

The MIC star replied: 'I was really REALLY unhappy for about 10 years, and I just couldn't shake my old habits.

Transformation: Louise was encouraged to embark on a healthier lifestyle when she first started dating her fiancé Ryan Libbey in 2016, and has since adopted her own love for fitness.

'I was continuously blacking out and I couldn't see a way out. Then I was introduced to a new way of living... and was also taught to love myself!

'I learnt how to say no. Learnt a lot of new things and mainly the fact that I had a choice.'  

London native Louise was encouraged to embark on a healthier lifestyle when she first started dating her fiancé Ryan Libbey in 2016, and has since adopted her own love for fitness.  

Back in April, Louise admitted she's 'working on her relationship' with fiancé Ryan and they still haven't made plans for their wedding.

The star, who got engaged to Ryan in 2018, told MailOnline 'I am just not sure exactly what I want yet' after cancelling her big day last December. 

In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'   

Way back when: Having shot to fame on the E4 show in 2011, Louise became part of a central storyline due to her romance with love rat Spencer Matthews
