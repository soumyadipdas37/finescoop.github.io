Golden Globe winner Drew Barrymore had a teary meltdown over the pressure of adjusting to full-time host of her daytime talk show The Drew Barrymore Show, which premieres Monday on CBS.

In part four of her making-of digital docuseries, the 45-year-old former child star admitted to being overwhelmed and 'really struggling' while talking to her Daytime Emmy Award-winning director Adam Heydt.

'[There's] so much going on in my head about how much I dislike myself as a human being, and this is really hard,' Drew said, spiraling.

'I'm trying so hard to be on time! I overtalk and share things that make people uncomfortable. And then everybody's like, "We need you on the floor." ... I hate the sound of my own voice!'

Barrymore's masked crew continuously reassures her throughout the 10-minute BTS video for the show, which has been in the works for 13 months.

Later, the former Hollywood wildchild gives herself a pep talk where she said having meltdowns and self-doubt can be 'liberating.'

Spiraling, Drew said: '[There's] so much going on in my head about how much I dislike myself as a human being, and this is really hard. I'm trying so hard to be on time!'

Barrymore continued: 'I overtalk and share things that make people uncomfortable. And then everybody's like, "We need you on the floor." ... I hate the sound of my own voice!'

'I have worked so hard at things because I am full of flaws. Oh my god, I'm so screwed up. I'm so imperfect!' Drew admitted.

'I've been so broken so many times in my life, and yet none of that can be an excuse to stay that way or to be upset or angry or ever take that out on anyone else. Or to have that be a reason that you can't get out of that and go to the next place.'

Barrymore stressed: 'I just want to get it right. I want to do everything to the best of my ability.'
