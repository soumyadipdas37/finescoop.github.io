Strictly Come Dancing pro Kevin Clifton has admitted he considered returning to the show after quitting.

The dancer, 37, revealed he came close to making a surprise U-turn and returning to the professional lineup, but 'didn't want to look like an idiot.'

In March Kevin stunned fans by revealing he'd quit Strictly Come Dancing after seven years on the show, and a year after finally being crowned series champion with Stacey Dooley.

Kevin told The Sun: 'There were a couple of conversations about it, like, is it worth talking about it?

'But then I thought, I've just made this big announcement. I don't want to look like an idiot. 

'We're having a constant conversation, and at the moment I feel I've pretty much done everything there is to do on the show.'

In March Kevin announced that he had quit Strictly's professional lineup after joining the show in 2013.

He was due to tour the country in a stage adaptation of Strictly Ballroom, but the show has been postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sources claimed at the time that Kevin felt he had 'outgrown' the show, and he previously said he wanted to pursue new avenues of his career. 

He told The Sun: 'I didn't have a life and I wanted to be able to do more. I want to show people what I'm about — not just, ''Here's my celebrity partner this year that I'm going to showcase.''

'I did have to turn down things in the past, which I was upset about sometimes, but I understood I was part of Strictly Come Dancing. Now I am going to pursue things I didn't have the time for. It's the right move.'

Kevin joined the Strictly lineup in 2013, and reached the final four times before finally being crowned series champion with Stacey Dooley in 2018.

His last series on the show saw him and presenter Anneka Rice be the second couple eliminated.
