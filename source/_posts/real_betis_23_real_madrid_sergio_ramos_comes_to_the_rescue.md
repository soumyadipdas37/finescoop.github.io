Sergio Ramos scored an 82nd minute penalty to give Real Madrid all three points at Real Betis on Saturday night.

Zinedine Zidane's side had to come back from 2-1 down but did so thanks to Emerson's own goal and Ramos' penalty. Emerson also saw red midway through the second half.

Fede Valverde gave Madrid the lead before goals from Aissa Mandi and William Carvalho had the hosts in front in Seville.

But after Emerson put the ball into his own net, Ramos stepped up to convert from 12 yards to earn the reigning LaLiga champions their first win of the season.
