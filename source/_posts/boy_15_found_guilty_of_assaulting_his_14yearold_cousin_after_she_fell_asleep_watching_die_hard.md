A teenager has been found guilty of raping his cousin, then 13, during a family barbecue after she fell asleep next to him on a couch as they watched a movie.

The victim reported the assault to police two years later, when she realised in a year 10 legal studies class the seriousness of what happened to her.

A judge-only trial this week heard the then-14-year-old and the girl were watching Die Hard at a relative's home on the Gold Coast during a night-time barbecue.

The girl then woke up to find her cousin's hand down her pants and his fingers inside her vagina.

She pushed him off of her and then he picked her up and dragged her into the bathroom, locking the door behind her. 

'I don't know what you're doing but I want to get out,' the girl remembered telling her cousin.

She managed to escape to the pool area to join her adult relatives, including her mother who told the court her daughter became 'very quiet'. 

The victim kept close to her mother's side for the rest of the trip and stayed as far away from her cousin as possible, according to court documents. 

The girl's mother told the court she had seen the pair asleep on the couch covered in a blanket. 

A few weeks before the girl went to police, she told a school counsellor what had happened to her, who informed her mother.

Court documents reveal the teenager had also told her sister and a friend what had happened to her. 

The trial was held in front of Judge Paul Smith, who said he believed the victim's version of events beyond reasonable doubt. The defendant pleaded not guilty.

He found the accused guilty of rape.

Judge Smith said he found the teenager showed a 'sexual interest' in his cousin, who said she was scared to come forward in case no one believed her. 

He said even though the accused said 'I'm sorry I guess' later that night, it couldn't be determined it was an admission of guilt or if it was even said, and if it was said that it was in relation to this offence. 

The victim testified that her 'entire life had been affected' by the attack.

She told the court she suffered from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety as a result.

The defence claimed that those conditions, as well as flashbacks, migraines, blackouts and disclosures to her sister and friend, could be a 'neurological disorder', but Judge Smith found there was no supporting medical evidence. 

The teenager will be sentenced on Wednesday.
