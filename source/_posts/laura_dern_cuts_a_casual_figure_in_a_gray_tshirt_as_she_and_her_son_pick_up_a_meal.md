Laura Dern showed off her casual style on Sunday as she made a quick trip in Los Angeles to grab a takeout order.

The 53-year-old Oscar winner dropped by the Brentwood Country Mart in Los Angeles with her 19-year-old son Ellery Harper.

The Marriage Story star highlighted her trim figure in a charcoal T-shirt, which she paired with a slim set of black jeans.

Laura rounded out the low-key ensemble with a pair of well-worn tan Gucci sneakers.

The 5ft10in Jurassic World: Dominion actress had her blonde locks parted down the middle and cascading down her shoulders in gentle waves.

Her son was also dressed casually with a gray plaid shirt atop a white T-shirt, black jeans and red sneakers.

Both she and Ellery wore masks to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, and he went a step further with a pair of blue nitrile gloves as he carried their food.

Although the coronavirus pandemic has shut down much of Hollywood, Laura has still managed to keep working on select projects.

She was recently back in Los Angeles after reprising her role as Dr. Ellie Sattler in the upcoming sequel Jurassic World: Dominion, which had been shooting in England.

The film, which stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, will see the return of Dern, as well as her original Jurassic Park costars Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum.

Goldblum led the 1998 sequel The Lost World, while Neill returned for 2001's Jurassic Park III, which featured a small cameo from Dern.

Goldblum appeared in a small scene in the last film, 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, but this is the first time all three original stars will be reunited in the franchise.

Although production was halted in March, Laura and her original costars didn't begin filming their parts until after filming had resumed in August.

Though some of the film was shot in Malta, the majority was filmed in England at Pinewood Studios.

The actress joked about going back to set in a July Instagram post featuring her Jurassic Park action figure against a window in England.

'In quarantine getting ready to get back to work,' she wrote. 

She also referenced the English shoot in a post about the electric car she was driving from late last month.

Still got it: The project comes amid a career renaissance which saw her win an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Big Little Lies and the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for Marriage Story

The new project comes amid a career renaissance for the actress, who first rose to prominence in the mid-1980s with acclaimed roles in Peter Bogdanovich's Mask (1985) and David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986).

In 2017, Dern began starring on HBO's Big Little Lies with Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley and Zoë Kravitz, which won her an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress in a miniseries.

The actress won her first ever Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role as a divorce lawyer in Noah Baumbach's acclaimed Netflix film Marriage Story from last year, which also starred Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson.

She followed that role by playing Marmee March in Greta Gerwig's rapturously received adaptation of Little Women.
