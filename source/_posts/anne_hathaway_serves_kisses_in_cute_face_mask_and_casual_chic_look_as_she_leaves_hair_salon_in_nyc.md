Anne Hathaway has been getting in some quality family time with her husband and sons during quarantine.

But the Academy Award winner is getting back to her daily routine, as the film industry bounces back from COVID-19.

She served kisses Saturday in a cute face mask that featured red lips, as she stepped out of a New York City hair salon in a casual chic plaid blazer look.

The 37-year-old wore the red and gray coat open, over a white t-shirt, which was tucked into some slim straight-leg high-waisted jeans.

She finished the look with some diamond stud earrings, a gold bangle, a light grey braided belt and a pair of nude leather pointed booties.

Hathaway had her hands full, as she carried a red leather crossbody bag and a blue leather tote bag. 

She previously took to Instagram with a tribute to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday at 87 years old.

The Devil Wears Prada actress wrote: 'God bless you and keep you, Ruth. We can never thank you enough. Rest in power, #RBG.'

Hathaway is currently in talks to star in a pandemic-themed romantic comedy/heist flick entitled Lockdown.

Directed by Doug Liman, the movie is set against the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's expected to begin filming in London by end of September. 

Many have taken to social media to express their disapproval of the film's timing, given the current economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus.

Hathaway can next be seen as the Grand High Witch in Robert Zemeckis' adaptation of Roald Dahl's 1983 literary classic The Witches, which is scheduled to premiere in 2021.
