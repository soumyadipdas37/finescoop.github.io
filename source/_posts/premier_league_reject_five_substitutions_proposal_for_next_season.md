The Premier League has voted on Thursday in favour of reinstating the norm of three substitutions per team per match, as opposed to the five changes rule brought in post-lockdown. 

The league's last vote fell in favour of traditional rules as 13 clubs voted against the additional subs, compared to the seven clubs who voted for. 

In the last vote, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Premier League champions Liverpool were among those pushing for five subs, but the 2020-21 season will see the number of substitutions revert to three.
