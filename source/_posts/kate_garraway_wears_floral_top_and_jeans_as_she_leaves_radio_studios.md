Kate added a glamorous flair to her look by wearing a white blazer to offset her colourful top, and she matched the outerwear with a pair of white trainers.

Her blonde locks were brushed into a sleek, straight style, and she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion. 

She completed her look by keeping her personal items in a large beige handbag, while she also carried two bag for life carrier bags full of items.

Kate's outing comes after fellow Good Morning Britain star Susanna Reid praised her for how she has handled her husband Derek's ongoing battle with coronavirus.

Her husband remains in hospital where he has spent the last six months fighting for his life, including three months in a coma.  

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph's Stella magazine on Sunday, Susanna said: 'It has been a nightmare that has knocked all of us for six, but Kate is living through it every day.

'To watch her put on a brave face and carry on has been an utter inspiration for all of us who work on the show, and I also know she's an inspiration to everyone who watches it.

Heading out: Kate was seen talking amicably to the person who took her home

'I don't want to speak on her behalf, but we are a very tight team and this has been the foremost of our thoughts.'

Earlier this month, Kate confirmed she would be returning to work on Smooth Radio so Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.'

The presenter had taken time off work to spend time with her children and Derek who remains in intensive care.

As she announced her return to the airwaves, Kate acknowledged the frightening circumstances she currently faces, but hopes work will provide a welcome distraction for both herself and her husband.

She said to The Sun: 'I’m delighted to be returning to my morning show on Smooth and to my Global family who have been a big support to me.

'Things are still hugely challenging and a long way from being normal, but I’d like to think that this will give Derek yet another opportunity to hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.

'My heartfelt thanks go to Myleene Klass who has been brilliantly care taking the show for me and to all my regular listeners for their messages of support.'

She admitted there couldn't be a more relaxing job to ease her back into a stable work routine.

In the midst of Derek's health battle, Kate has focused on looking after their children, Billy, 11, and Darcy, 14.

She announced her temporary departure from Good Morning Britain in August so she could help her children prepare for their return to school, after returning for a few weeks earlier in the summer.

She told viewers: 'I’m actually not here next week. I’m taking a bit of time off, to help Billy get ready for secondary school, and my other children.

'And also Derek, look after that. I just want to say thank you to all of you for absolutely being brilliant since I’ve come back through troubling times.'

She revealed her partner has lost a whopping eight stone over the past six months and was placed in a medically-induced coma to aid his recovery.

He is now out of his coma but still remains in intensive care.

In a moving interview in Saturday's You magazine, Kate said: 'We hope and believe he will come out of it but we just don't know.

'The heart of the family has been ripped out and we don't know if we will ever get it back.'
