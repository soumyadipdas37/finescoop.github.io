The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert appears to be making the most of his time of in the limelight. 

On Monday, the 31-year-old reality star was mobbed by fans as he stepped out to grab a bite to eat in Perth.

Despite none of the employees wearing a mask, Locky appeared to be in good spirits as he posed with a flock of female employees - who seemed all too excited to meet the hunk.

As of Monday, Western Australia has four active cases of COVID-19.

Just one day earlier, Locky could not wipe the smile off his face as he happily signed autographs and took selfies with another fan who spotted the star.

It comes amid reports that Gilbert grew tired of the constant interruptions at the cocktail parties, and eventually had to excuse himself to calm down.

According to New Idea, the thrill seeker asked producers for a breather after spending hours being pulled in different directions by the women.

While Locky understood the whole point of the cocktail parties was for the women to get his attention, he still found the experience stressful.

He didn't enjoy having a string of women 'jumping in to have a chat' and reportedly told his producer he 'couldn't handle it', a source said.

The former Australian Survivor star apparently requested a time-out after one of the women interrupted his private time with rumoured winner Irena Srbinovska.

The Bachelor continues on Wednesday at 7.30pm on TEN.
