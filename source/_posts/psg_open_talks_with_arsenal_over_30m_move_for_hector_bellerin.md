Bellerin is under contract until 2023 but is open to a new challenge.

PSG have been long term admirers and persistent in their pursuit. They have proposed £25m with a further £5m in add ons.

Arsenal value him higher than that and talks will continue. Meanwhile, Arsenal confirmed the £22.6million signing of Gabriel Magalhaes from Lille on Tuesday.

The 22-year old Brazilian will wear the number six shirt and manager Mikel Arteta said: 'He has many qualities which will make us stronger as a defensive unit and as a team.

'He has proved with Lille that he is a defender with many outstanding attributes and we are looking forward to watching him grow as an Arsenal player.'

Arteta, has spent £41m in fees already with Magalhaes' price due to rise to £27m eventually.

They have already signed Pablo Mari from Flamengo, made Cedric Soares's move from Southampton permanent and brought in Willian from Chelsea on a substantial contract. They now need to begin offloading players to help balance the books.
