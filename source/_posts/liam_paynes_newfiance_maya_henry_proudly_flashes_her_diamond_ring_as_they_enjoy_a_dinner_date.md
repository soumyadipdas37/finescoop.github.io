He recently revealed that he is 'blissfully happy' with his new fiancée.

And Liam Payne, 27, certainly looked smitten with partner Maya Henry, 20, as they headed to Amazonico in Mayfair, London on Thursday. 

Strolling hand in hand, the couple put on a cosy display as they enjoyed a cosy dinner date in the capital.

Maya was a vision on the outing as she teamed a black bardot top with chic leather flares. 

The Texan model accessorised with a small Louis Vuitton handbag and a delicate silver necklace, and there was no hiding the giant diamond on her ring finger. 

Liam also looked stylish for the date as he rocked a black T-shirt and jeans with fresh white trainers.  

Young love! Liam recently revealed that he is 'blissfully happy' with his new fiancée

Last week, Liam said that he and his new fiancée Maya are 'blissfully happy'.

The news that the couple had become betrothed broke last month during an appearance on Good Morning America. 

And the One Direction star revealed that his girlfriend saying 'yes' to his proposal had been part of a wonderful few days in his life.

After being congratulated on his news, he said: 'We're just really happy. I mean, in the last week, I've just had a birthday, my son has gone to school for the first time today, so it seems like a lot of firsts for me, really, actually, which is great.'

Liam shares three-year-old son Bear with his former partner Cheryl, whom he split from in July 2018.

It was confirmed that the For You hitmaker had popped the question to Maya in August after the brunette beauty was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her left hand after having dinner with Liam at Novikov Restaurant & Bar in London.

The couple were first spotted together back in August 2018, but didn't make their romance Instagram office until September 2019.

Liam has previously described Maya - who he initially met when she was a fan of One Direction - as his 'best friend'.

He said: 'I've found someone who's genuinely my best friend. She's just so relaxed about everything and someone who's completely got your back with everything is just the wildest thing.   

'I don't think I've ever really experienced that before in someone so it's quite a wonder to watch actually.'

He's a real gent: Ever the gentleman, Liam lead the way and opened the car door for his new fiancee as they enjoyed a night out in the capital

The singer has also insisted that Maya had helped him cope with his fame and had given him the confidence to be himself in public and simply relax and not worry about any attention he might receive.

He said: 'The difference is with [Maya], she's so relaxed that it helps me relax in a situation, rather than being somewhere and talk about who is watching and what's going on.

'People are going to watch whatever. What am I supposed to do? I can't do anything about it now. It's too late for that.'
