His beloved dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer following four months of health woes and trips to the hospital.

And on Tuesday James Jordan took to Instagram to share a sweet picture of his father staring lovingly at his seven-month-old daughter Ella.  

The Strictly pro, 42, became a dad in February this year following a successful first round of IVF with his wife and Strictly co-star Orla, 37.

In the heartwarming post Ella looked up to her grandfather and donned a sweet pink Gucci baby grow while sitting on the sofa.  

Meanwhile his father was every inch the doting grandparent as he smiled at Ella who rested her tiny hands on his. 

Captioning the picture, James simply penned 'love' accompanied by a single red love heart.

On his Instagram story James posted a sweet picture with Orla who cradled their daughter, captioned: 'Trying to take a selfie with Ella is a nightmare'. 

The doting father also shared footage of a bonny Ella having fun in her baby jumper before posting a pretty portrait of Ella with her grandmother. 

He also posted an adorable picture of Ella on her changing mat in a pink towel following her bath.   

In July James revealed to his followers that his father had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

The dancer took to Instagram to share the heartbreaking news, as he also appealed to his followers for help in finding a specialist surgeon for his dad.

In announcing the news, the former Strictly Come Dancing pro shared a video of his daughter Ella being doted on by his father, as he admitted: 'Tears are streaming down my face.'

James wrote: 'This video is the most precious & personal thing I have in my life right now & I’m going to share it with you but with a totally broken heart.

'Over the last 4 months my hero and best mate in the whole world has been in and out of hospital with very ill health.

'We were told several times that 100% he had had a stroke and that’s why they were struggling to control his seizures... but after the 3rd time of being admitted to hospital I knew something was not quite right. 

'So after pushing for more tests and the results being sent to Kings College Hospital for other surgeons to look at unfortunately the results came back that it wasn’t a stroke after all.



'It was what I had dreaded, my dad has a tumour and after having a biopsy it’s come back that it’s an aggressive cancerous one. The worst kind unfortunately.

'We have been told that it’s not advisable to operate because of where the tumour is and wouldn’t actually make that much difference even if they could.

'The end result is, it’s terminal. They are saying with chemotherapy and radiotherapy we might be lucky and get a year with him.

'As I write this tears are streaming down my face as I’m sure many of you have the same love for your parents. This is honestly the worst time of my life.'  

Heartbreaking news: In July James revealed that his beloved dad has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, following four months of health woes and trips to the hospital 

However, while he expressed his heartbreak over the shocking news, James revealed plans to keep on fighting and not accept the doctor's most recent verdict. 

He continued: 'I’m posting this and writing to you now as I want to get a second opinion on my father, especially because they misdiagnosed him for the first 4 months which doesn’t fill us with confidence.

'So now myself and my family are actually hoping they are wrong this time. I’m looking to find the best surgeon to see my father as I want to know I’ve done everything possible before I can accept it.'

Appealing to his followers for help, he concluded: 'If anyone that reads this can advise me and my family on who is supposedly the best in this field I would be eternally grateful. My heart is broken. Please DM me if you can help.' 

The dancing star and his wife, Ola, have been together for more than 20 years and married in 2003, but they chose to delay having a children to focus on their careers. 

Both dancers became staples on the Strictly Come Dancing show before James decided to leave the show in 2013, and his other half followed two years later.
