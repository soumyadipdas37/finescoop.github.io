Sir Rocco Forte's daughter Irene has married tech whizz Felix Winckler in a 'very intimate family affair'. 

The Oxford graduate, 31, who is Wellness Director at her family's £340million hotel empire and founder of Irene Forte Skincare, announced the happy news on Instagram yesterday.

Irene, who had planned a wedding in Sicily before the pandemic, shared two stunning photographs of her tying the knot with her boyfriend of several years in London, captioned '19.09.20' along with a heart and dove emoji.

In the snaps, she showed off her smart white bridal suit, with a tuxedo jacket by Yves Saint Laurent and a statement pillbox hat with veil by Jane Taylor London.

The bride's elegant heels were by Aquazzura, while her chic bouquet was by Ellie Hartley Flowers in Mayfair. She was styled by Tatler's Fashion Director Sophie Goodwin. 

'It was a very intimate family affair instead of a wedding originally planned in Sicily that same weekend,' due to COVID-19 restrictions, a family friend told FEMAIL.

In one of the images shared by Irene, the couple, who became engaged in January this year, are seen standing outside their wedding building, sharing a kiss while surrounded by their family and friends.

A second shows the pair walking down the streets of London, hand-in-hand, before a beaming Irene and her husband turn back towards the camera.

Irene kept her long, blonde locks down while sporting stand-out diamond earrings and a smattering of glamorous makeup. 

Friends rushed to congratulate the pair on Instagram, with British TV presenter Pips Taylor writing: 'Huge congratulations.'

Jessica Richards, the owner behind Brooklyn based beauty company Shen, beloved by celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Rachel Weisz, added: 'Oh my gosh gorgeous congrats! Sending so much love and happiness your way.'

Groom Mr Winckler, who is the co-founder of Reflaunt Resell Service, which encourages brands to embrace the second-hand marketplace, is no stranger to society romances, having previously courted Princess Caroline of Monaco’s daughter Charlotte Casiraghi. 

Meanwhile Irene previously dated Jacobi Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, the half-brother of Cressida Bonas for five years before splitting in 2016. 

Miss Forte, who runs an eponymous skincare line, often posts about her beau on Instagram, including loved-up messages to mark his birthday.

Irene's older sister, Lydia Forte, who is director of food and beverage at Rocco Forte Hotels, married her husband Greek shipping heir Dimitri Chandris four years ago.

Their Tuscan wedding was one of the society events of 2016, with guests including Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Other high society couples who decided to wed in more low-key, private nuptials this year because of the pandemic include Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and Cressida Bonas and Harry Wentworth-Stanley.
