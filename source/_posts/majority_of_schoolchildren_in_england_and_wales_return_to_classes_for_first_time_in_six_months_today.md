The majority of pupils will be three months behind in their studies when they return to classrooms in England and Wales this week - with those in poorer areas hardest hit, according to a survey.

A poll of nearly 3,000 school leaders and teachers found that 98% felt students were not as far along with their learning as would normally be expected at the end of the 2019/20 school year.

Almost a quarter (21%) of teachers from across more than 2,200 mainstream primary and secondary schools also said they thought boys had fallen further behind than girls.

The National Foundation for Educational Research's (NFER) survey comes as many students return to classrooms this week for the first time since lockdown.

The study found that as of July, teachers had on average covered 66% of the curriculum during the 2019/20 academic year.

Teachers estimated on average that their pupils were three months behind in their studies, but 53% of those teaching in the poorest schools in England reported their students were 'four months or more' behind in their learning.

The figure for teachers in wealthier settings was 15%, the survey said. 



Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said next year's school exams could be delayed

Next year's GCSE and A-level exams could be pushed back to give pupils more time to study the syllabus, the Education Secretary has said.

Gavin Williamson said England's exams regulator, Ofqual, was working with the education sector to decide whether there should be a 'short delay' to the exam timetable in 2021.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'I know there's some concern about next year's exams, and that's why we've been working with Ofqual on changes we can make to help pupils when they take GCSEs and A-levels next year.

'Ofqual will continue to work with the education sector and other stakeholders on whether there should be a short delay to the GCSE, A and AS-level exam timetable in 2021, with the aim of creating more teaching time.'

Exam season usually begins in May, but the paper said sources suggested they could be pushed back to June and July – but they would not cut into the summer holidays.

Mr Williamson's comments – on the eve of many schools in England reopening to all pupils for the first time since March – follow a call from Labour for a delay to next year's exams.

Shadow education secretary Kate Green said pupils entering Year 11 and 13 who have lost up to six months of teaching time face 'a mountain to climb' unless the timetable is changed.

She said: 'Ministers had warning after warning about problems with this year's exam results, but allowed it to descend into a fiasco.

'This is too important for Boris Johnson to leave until the last minute. Pupils heading back to school need clarity and certainty about the year ahead.'

Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: 'Labour's suggestion of a delay to help with 'catch-up' is worthy of serious consideration.

'A delay is not without its problems, a consequential delay to the publication of results will put pressure on higher education providers such as universities and colleges as well as employers. All this will need to be dealt with.'

 

It also found that the learning gap between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers had increased by 46%, adding that the figure was likely to be an 'under-estimate'.

Dr Angela Donkin, chief social scientist at NFER, said: 'Whilst it is crucial that children catch up, we should not assume that teachers will immediately be able to deliver the same quality of teaching, at the same speed, as before the pandemic.

'There remains a range of barriers for teachers and schools, which means catch-up should be seen as part of the ongoing process of learning recovery, for most pupils, rather than as a quick-turnaround solution.'

She said it was 'clear' that additional support needed to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils and schools in the poorest areas.

The majority of pupils had been expected to learn at home throughout the 2019/20 summer term, but teachers reported that only 38% returned their last piece of set work in July, compared to 42% in May.

School leaders said that just over half (56%) of students who were eligible to return did so, with those from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds having lower attendance at 49%.

Almost a third (32%) of school leaders said safety concerns from parents were a common reason for their children not attending.

Almost three quarters of teachers (74%) did not feel able to teach to their usual standard while the coronavirus regulations were in force, the survey found.

In an open response question, 49% of 1,034 teachers whose teaching was affected said distancing requirements had a negative impact on areas such as group work and their ability to interact with pupils properly.

More than half of school leaders (51%) also reported that they were using teaching assistants to lead classes.

Teachers estimated that 44% of their pupils will need 'intensive catch-up support', the survey said, with the percentage increasing to 57% in the most deprived schools.

NFER's list of recommendations included the need for schools to receive further support to manage pupil non-attendance and more money to help with managing coronavirus safety measures.

The Department for Education said its £1 billion 'Covid catch-up package' will tackle the impact of lost teaching time and include 'targeted funding' for the most disadvantaged students.

Shadow education Secretary Kate Green said: 'The learning that children have lost in recent months shows that keeping schools safely open to all must be a national priority in the months ahead.

'When schools are closed, we see deep inequalities become more entrenched, and those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds lose out most.'

Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, which represents leaders in the majority of schools, said: 'This is another alarm bell that the Government needs to pay attention to.

'The Covid-19 pandemic has interrupted education for the majority of children, and schools were already struggling to provide everything children needed before this crisis, damaged as they and other social services have been by a decade of austerity.'

Mr Whiteman said schools will 'absolutely require' additional support to 'play their part in healing the scars' left by the pandemic.



Marcus Rashford is spearheading a task force on the issue of child food poverty and is warning of 'devastating' effects on the stability of the country if action is not taken quickly.

The Manchester United and England striker was successful in campaigning for free school meal vouchers to be provided to pupils over the summer period.

He had spoken about his own experience of using a food voucher scheme as a child and was praised after pressing the Government into making a U-turn on the issue.

Mr Rashford, 22, has now teamed up with the food industry to shed light on the issue of child food poverty in the UK.

Along with Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Deliveroo, FareShare, Food Foundation, Iceland, Kellogg's, Lidl, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose, he has formed the 'Child Food Poverty Task Force'.

Over the next six weeks, the task force members will dedicate their platforms to sharing stories of those most affected by child food insecurity in the UK.

Mr Rashford said the task force is endorsing three national food strategy policy recommendations.

In a letter to MPs, Mr Rashford said the objective is to 'see sufficient funds from the Chancellor's Budget and Spending Review allocated to implementing these without delay'.

The first one is the expansion of free school meals to every child from a household on Universal Credit or equivalent, reaching an additional 1.5million seven-16-year-olds.

The second one is the expansion of holiday provision (food and activities) to support all children on free school meals, reaching an additional 1.1million children.

And the third one is increasing the value of the Healthy Start vouchers to £4.25 per week (from £3.10) and expanding into all those on Universal Credit or equivalent, reaching an additional 290,000 pregnant women and children under the age of four.

'These children are the future - our next generation of NHS workers, police officers, footballers and politicians,' Mr Rashford wrote (stock image)

In his letter, Mr Rashford wrote: 'When we pause, listen and reflect on what the future of our next generation could potentially look like, it's easy to see that if we don't take action quickly, the issue of child food poverty will have devastating effects on the stability of our country.

'These children are the future - our next generation of NHS workers, police officers, footballers and politicians.'

Mr Rashford recalls his own experience, writing: 'I remember the sound of my mum crying herself to sleep to this day, having worked a 14-hour shift, unsure how she was going to make ends meet.'

He said he has sat with parents who have 'cried with sheer relief that putting food on their children's plates was one less thing to worry about this summer'.

He told MPs: 'I spoke to a mother recently who, along with her two young sons, is currently living off three slices of bread a day - soaking them in hot water and adding sugar, hoping that the porridge consistency might better sustain the hunger of her one-year-old child.

'I spoke to a family who were sleeping on one mattress on the floor - the reason being, just like any good parent would, they had had no choice but to sell every valuable they owned to put food on the table for their children.

'All of this, a result of unforeseen circumstances that are entirely out of their control, such as redundancy and illness.

'This is the true reality of England in 2020.'
