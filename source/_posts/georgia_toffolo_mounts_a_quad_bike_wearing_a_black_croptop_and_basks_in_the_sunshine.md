Georgia Toffolo is still living it large in the sunshine - as she continues to celebrate the end of lockdown travel restrictions weeks after they actually ended.

The former Made In Chelsea star, 25, gave quad biking a whirl over the weekend, admitting she 'loathed' it.

Donning a black crop-top and leggings - and of course a crash helmet - the reality personality posed as she mounted the bike on top of a rocky hill.

Grinning from ear to ear, Toff posed on the bike against a stunning sun-kissed backdrop - mountainous terrain, blue skies and crystalline seas.

'Loathed it! But did it!' she captioned the snap.

The post then took a strange turn, as she went on: 'Does anyone have any self care rituals that really help them find balance? Sounds weird but dry brushing before I get in the bath and writing a gratitude list bring me so much joy.

'In the look out for MORE! Anything to make us feel invincible and HAPPY!'

The 60s-inspired ensemble by sustainable clothing brand Cro-Che showed off her trim waist with a cut-out detailing at the midriff.

Toff looked happy in the image, revealing alongside it: 'After my first proper night out sober last night in ages, I’m raring to go again tonight!

'I’ve set myself a little challenge of 1 month no booze and so far I’m loving it!'

She has been tapping into full relaxation mode during her sun-soaked getaway with her beloved spaniel Monty - flaunting her figure in swimwear on her days by the pool and ocean.

The ex Queen of the Jungle stunned in a lilac bralet and matching briefs by Oceanus, decorated with hand embroidered Swarovski crystals throughout in a recent snap by the sea.

Another image saw the reality star put on a busty display in a plunging white bikini top by Shein while embracing her natural complexion by ditching make-up.

The media personality captioned her posts: 'Another week of self love, affirmations, meditation and (mostly [laughing emoji])healthy nourishing food. 

'Contentment❤️ featuring wet dog bottom in this happy snap! thank you @oceanus_swim for this banging bikini - it’s so beautiful.' (sic)
