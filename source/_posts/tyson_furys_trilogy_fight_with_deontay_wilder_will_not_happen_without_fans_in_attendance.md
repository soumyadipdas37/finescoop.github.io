The possibility of Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder going toe-to-toe without spectators has been dealt a knockout blow by the former's promoter, Frank Warren.

The highly-anticipated trilogy fight had been pencilled in for this year after Fury beat Wilder in February to win the WBC heavyweight title.

However, those plans have been put on hold due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

But, Fury's promoter Frank Warren says it will only happen with fans due to stop revenue loss

Boxing has returned in recent months with Warren holding fight cards without fans but he has ruled out this possibility for this bout due to the sheer size of it - instead suggesting that it could be held outside of the UK or USA if the landscape is different in another country.

Speaking on Wednesday's Good Morning Britain, Fury's UK-based promoter said: 'Not a fight of that magnitude [taking place without fans].

'Wilder and Fury was the highest grossing fight to ever take place in Vegas. We just can't lose that gate. It's a huge amount of money. We need the gate.

'Or we come up with a scenario where there is a huge site fee from a territory to take it, and we use it to promote their country.

'We are looking at those situations.'

The previous two bouts have taken place in Las Vegas and Fury's US-based promoter, Top Rank's Bob Arum, previously revealed he is working on a protocol with the Nevada commission that would allow a limited amount of fans to gain entry.

'It is quite frustrating to be honest but we're not in this boat alone,' Fury told Good Morning Britain on Wednesday when asked about the situation.

'I'm not the only athlete on the planet who is not active at the moment. We're all in it together.

'We're all working as a team to source a date and a venue. Hopefully they'll allow crowds in sooner or later - we're just all working towards that goal.

Fury vs Wilder III previously received a bold bid to be staged in Australia on Christmas Day.

Speaking to Sky Sports, promoter Dean Lonergan said:Â 'I just made the point: "Bob, if Australia opens up, you could come down here. Here's a budget, here's what it could look like. We've worked together before it would be a great place to do it".'

Speaking on Wednesday, Fury told of his frustration but hopes an outcome can be sorted soon
