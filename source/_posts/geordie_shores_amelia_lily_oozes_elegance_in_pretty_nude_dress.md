The star, 25, who shot to fame during the eighth series of X Factor in 2011, looked stunning in a pretty nude dress for the meak with Kyle, who revealed they had utilised the Eat Out To Help Out scheme.

Amelia was putting on an elegant display in the chic dress, which was worlds away from the beloved bodycon dresses of the Geordie Shore girls. 

She boosted her height with a pair of black heels while adding a chic touch with a coordinating leather handbag from Yves Saint Laurent. 

Insistent on giving her look a kooky touch, her pink hair added an edgy feel to the otherwise extremely muted yet stunning style.  

Her pal Kyle was looking sleek in a pink blazer with a black shirt.

Despite relative chart success with tracks You Bring Me Joy and Shut Up And Give Me Whatever You've Got, she turned her hand to musical theatre when she appeared in Green Day's musical American Idiot.

She appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2017, later signing on to Geordie Shore. 

Of the show, she said, 'I am finally ready to let loose my inner wild child,' and admits that during her time on the series the bond she made with the rest of the girls' more than made up' for her tendency to be 'unlucky in love'.
