The year 2020 has been a rough one for most of us, but Hotels.com and Miller Lite are teaming up to make it a little bit groovier. 

The beer brand is throwing it back to 1975 — the year it was first introduced nationally — and transformed a Mona Lake, Michigan lake house in to a '70s-era timeshare. 

The Miller Timeshare — a 'good vibes only pad' — will be available to book for groups of up to eight people from September 10 to the 30th for just $96, and it comes stocked with plenty of booze.

Groovy, man! It's filled with mod furniture, shag carpets, house plants, and funky wood paneling, with a very appropriate color palette of browns and oranges

The house rental is like a trip back in time, having been redecorated with a '70s theme.

It's filled with mod furniture, shag carpets, house plants, and funky wood paneling, with a very appropriate color palette of browns and oranges — except for the avocado-green kitchen.

There's also plenty of entertainment, including a game room stocked with a pinball machine, a functioning record player with records to play, and throwback ‘70s board games like Twister.

And that entertainment is going to be necessary, since there's no WiFi — just like in the '70s.

The house also comes fully stocked with Miller Lite, plus a retro mini bar with snacks like Funyuns, Ring Pops, and Ding Dongs.

A place to chill: Outside on the patio is a grill, a fire, and view of the lake

 'End of summer travel looks a little different this year,' Courtney Dugan, director of activation for Miller Lite, said in a press release. 'But it’s still time for Miller Time'

'End of summer travel looks a little different this year,' Courtney Dugan, director of activation for Miller Lite, said in a press release. 

'But it’s still time for Miller Time, so Miller Lite created the Miller Timeshare, a groovy space for a small group to get together, put on a record, crack open some beers, and escape 2020 for a couple days.'
