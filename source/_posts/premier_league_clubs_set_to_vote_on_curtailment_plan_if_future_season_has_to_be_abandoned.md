Premier League clubs will vote on Thursday on a curtailment plan to be used to determine final league positions if subsequent seasons are abandoned, Sportsmail has learned. 

The top-flight clubs want clarity on the issue and a mechanism for deciding final standings to be written into the competition's rules after controversy over curtailment threatened to derail Project Restart last season.

In the occasionally heated Premier League meetings during lockdown the clubs failed to agree how the 2019-20 campaign should be decided if it could not be completed on the pitch due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a problem that was eventually overcome by the government endorsing a resumption on a bio-secure basis. 

Liverpool won the Premier League title in 2019-20 following a season that was disrupted by three months thanks to the coronavirus pandemic

Premier League matches were played behind closed doors following its resumption in June

The competing proposals for curtailment put forward included the suspension of relegation, league placings determined by points-per-game or a weighted version of average points taking into account home and away matches played.

The FA effectively vetoed ending relegation due to the detrimental impact such a dramatic move could have on the EFL, and the resultant threat of legal action, so that solution has not been re-visited during the talks that have taken place during the close-season. 

Instead the Premier League are set to propose that if next season had to be curtailed then existing league positions would stand if each club had played a minimum of 19 matches, which will be put to a vote of the clubs. 

Under this model points-per-game would be used if clubs had played a different number of matches at the time of curtailment assuming half the league campaign had been completed.

Manchester United secured a Champions League place on the final day of the season but a future Premier League season disrupted by coronavirus could be decided on points-per-game

The Premier League will also finalise broadcasting arrangements for next season at Thursday's shareholders' meeting, with several fans groups demanding that extra live games are televised live until supporters are permitted to return to stadiums. 

An additional 20 matches have been made available to the rights holders taking the number to be screened live to 220 out of 380, but many clubs are reluctant to give up more games free of charge and the broadcasters are unwilling to increase their fees.

A proposal to increase the number of substitutions available to managers from three to five, as was the case during Project Restart, will also be discussed but it is unclear whether it will receive the 14 votes required for it to be introduced.
