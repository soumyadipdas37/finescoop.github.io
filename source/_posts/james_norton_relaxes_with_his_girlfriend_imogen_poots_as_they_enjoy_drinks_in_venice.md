James was suited and booted following his appearance on the red carpet for the premiere of his new film Nowhere Special at the festival.

He and Imogen took the weight off their feet in a nearby bar as they enjoyed a drink together.

Imogen sported a chic printed shirt dress as she posed for a selfie with beau James in their matching masks, reminding their fans to wear face coverings during the COVID-19 crisis.

Nowhere Special is an upcoming 2020 internationally co-produced drama film, written, directed, and produced by Uberto Pasolini.

James, who plays window cleaner John, dedicates his existence to his three-year-old son after his mother left them soon after she gave birth.

But when John is given just months to live, he sets out to find a perfect family for his little boy once he is gone.

Amid frenzied speculation about who will be the next to play Bond, with stars including Richard Madden and Idris Elba being linked with the role, a source told the publication both sides were trying 'to get a deal signed off'. 

'Producers wanted a Brit and James ticks all the boxes - tall, strapping, physically fit and, of course, looks great in a dinner jacket.

'Everyone is hoping to get the deal confirmed and signed off, with an announcement in the summer.' 

Say cheese! Both James and Imogen documented their trip to Italy after he travelled to Venice for the film festival
