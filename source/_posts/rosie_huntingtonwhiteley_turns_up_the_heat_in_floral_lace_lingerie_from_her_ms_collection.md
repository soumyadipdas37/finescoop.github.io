She's a model and designer who never fails to impress with her fashionable looks.

And Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was sure to turn up the heat as she flaunted her svelte physique in floral lace lingerie.

The mother-of-one, 33, looked sensational as she posed up a storm in a selection of underwear during a recent photoshoot for her new Marks & Spencer collection.

Wow: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looked sensational as she as she flaunted her svelte physique in floral lace lingerie from her latest Marks & Spencer collection

Rosie exuded confidence as she showed off a black two-piece set which boasted a pretty floral pattern and intricate lace detailing on the sides of the knickers.

The beauty also wowed in blush pink lingerie which also had a lace trim around the bottoms and back of the bra.

Proving she can rock any look, Rosie was also seen channeling a more sporty vibe as she modelled a grey underwear duo which scooped slightly around her cleavage. 

Rosie wore her blonde locks down and perfectly curled as for the shoot and added a full face of makeup including a pretty nude lipstick.

The sizzling snaps come after Rosie took to Instagram on Tuesday to model no less than nine different outfits.

The model showed off her style credentials as she posed for a series of glam mirror selfies, much to the delight of her fans, with many of her looks dripping in designer goods - including a series of Bottega Veneta pieces worth £12,185.

Rosie was clearly in the mood to showcase her extensive wardrobe as she rocked seven stylish ensembles on her Instagram stories, before taking to her grid with a further two. 

Among the outfits modelled, Rosie showcased her slender pins in a khaki mini dress, which she paired with gold heels, a tan clutch bag and dark sunglasses.

While she also stunned in a cream wrap dress, accessorising with a tan belt, sand coloured heels she added in Bottega Veneta's Jodie small knotted intrecciato textured-leather tote which markets for £2,465. 

The actress wasn't done there as she then took to her grid where she once again showed off her phenomenal style with a further two looks.  

This time she donned a tan trench coat, which she paired with a crisp white shirt, indigo jeans, a brown fluffy handbag and simple heels.

While her other ensemble consisted of a baggy cream shirt, blue jeans and a tan bag with matching heels. 

It comes after Rosie, who lives in LA with her fiance, Hollywood movie star Jason Statham, and son Jack, three, discussed feeling under pressure to have cosmetic treatments.

The blonde beauty told The Daily Mail earlier this month: 'I don’t like to try anything extreme. I’m cautious, especially in LA where people are like, “Do you want breakfast and Botox?” and I’m like, “Uh, no. I’ll take the breakfast and you can keep the Botox".'
