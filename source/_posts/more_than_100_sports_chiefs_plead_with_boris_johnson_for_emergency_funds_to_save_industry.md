More than 100 sports chiefs, including Premier League and FA bosses, have written to Boris Johnson pleading for emergency funds to prop-up the industry in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. 

The leaders of the sports bodies are warning that the future of the sector is 'perilous', but that government funding will help avoid a 'lost generation of activity'.

In a letter, reportedly seen by BBC Sport, the group has urged the Prime Minister to provide a 'sports recovery fund' in order to help the industry endure the prolonged effects of the pandemic.

It comes after teams, tournament holders and sports venues across the country suffered a shock loss in revenue due to the postponement of all sports fixtures at the height of the pandemic earlier this year.

Clubs are also facing the prolonged impact of a loss of match day revenue, with only a small number of fans returning to a handful of sports fixtures following the easing of lockdown in August.

As the Bundesliga returned to action on Saturday, so did its fans, many of them for the first time since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

In Germany's capital city, Berlin, where local rules allow mass events of up to 5,000 people, matchday at Bundesliga minnows Union Berlin almost felt like a proper matchday again.

Albeit one with considerably smaller crowds. 

Of the 22,000 fans who would normally cram into the Alte Foersterei, only 4,600 were allowed in this weekend, with tickets allocated via a lottery among season-ticket holders. 

For those who did come, there were restrictions aplenty.

Masks were compulsory when walking to and from your seat, while new painted markings ensured social distancing in the standing areas.

There was also a ban on beer in the stadium.

Despite the delight of fans to return, Union Berlin lost the game 3-1 to Augsburg.

Plans by the government to review the partial return of fans to all sports stadiums on October 1 could also be postponed following a spike in cases across the UK, according to reports. 

The letter by sports bosses, written by organisations including the Football Association, Premier League, Rugby Football Union and England and Wales Cricket Board, reportedly states: 'We require a comprehensive support package for the sport and physical sector to aid its recovery.

'This package must combine investment, tax incentives, and regulatory reform.

'Covid-19 has undermined our commercial revenue streams with both stadiums and leisure facilities closed or greatly reduced in capacity.

'The impact of this will potentially lead to a lost generation of sport and activity.'

Lisa Wainwight, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, told the BBC: 'The strength of this coalition from the sports, recreation and activity sector cannot be ignored in its public call to the prime minister.

'It is imperative that our sector gets the support it requires from the government to get back to business, in order to ease the pressures on the NHS and play a central role in our nation's recovery.'

Meanwhile The Guardian says it understands the Government is set to delay the partial return of fans to professional sport stadiums on October 1 due to the surge in coronavirus cases.

The government had planned to allow teams to let in 30 per cent of a venue's capacity - but this was later cut to a maximum of 1,000 spectators.

There here have been a number of test events with spectators returning to sport from matches in football's pre-season, including a friendly between Premier League sides Chelsea and Brighton, as well as snooker at The Crucible and cricket matches at The Oval and Edgbaston.

Boris Johnson has delayed plans to partially return fans to all sports stadiums on October 1 due to the recent spike in Covid cases.

Pilot events have been taking place with a maximum of 1,000 fans in each stadium, with the intention of returning all venues to 30 per cent capacity by the start of next month.

But Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove confirmed this morning that measures have been shelved for now.

'We’ve been piloting some open air venues and we do want to be able in due course to allow people to return to watch football and other sporting events,' Gove told Sky News.

'We need to be cautious at the moment and I think a mass reopening at this stage wouldn’t be appropriate.'

The move comes in light of increasing restrictions imposed by the Government from Thursday amid fears of a strong second wave of Covid-19 this autumn.

Meanwhile, plans to reintroduce fans to horse racing events were scuppered earlier this month when a pilot event to allow a small number of spectators for the final three days of races at the St Leger Festival in Doncaster.

The decision to pull the plug is thought to have cost £250,000 in lost revenue.

But that is little compared to reports suggestion Britain's 59 racing tracks were losing £8million a month while the sport was locked down and have still been losing £4m while they race behind closed doors.

Average revenue from racegoers is 47 per cent of their overall racecourse income and that rise to around 60 per cent for the bigger tracks with larger crowds and meatier hospitality spend.

And while major sporting fixtures, such as Premier League football, still have merchandise and TV revenue to rely on, other professional and semi-professional sports teams are struggling without match-day income.  

Last month, a group of MPs, led by former sports minister Tracey Crouch, urged the Government to allow limited crowds at National League football matches this season, while warning of the 'perilous future' that those clubs are facing. 

Meanwhile, analysis from the District Councils' Network (DCN), which represents 187 authorities across the country, found local leisure services had taken a £180million hit as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown. 

The group warned the overall financial loss facing the sector could reach £305million by the end of year, leaving many leisures centres at risk from going bust.

The warning comes as a group representing leisure trusts in Wales said public pools and sports centres could be at risk of closing without more government money.

Community Leisure UK told the BBC that 15 cultural and leisure facilities in Wales were at risk of closure due to a loss of revenue from when sports facilities were forced to close at the height of the pandemic. 

The Welsh Government said it had given extra money but the Welsh Local Government Association said long-term funding was needed.
