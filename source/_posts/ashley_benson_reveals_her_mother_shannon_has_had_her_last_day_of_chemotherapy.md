However, it's been reported that 28-year-old Cara, who split from Ashley back in April, has started seeing G's former flame Halsey. 

According to The Sun, Cara - who currently resides in Los Angeles - has been enjoying a new romance with singer and budding actress Halsey, 25, after separating from Benson.
