Kmart Australia has launched a new website feature that allows customers to see how products look in their homes before buying them

Kmart Australia has launched a new website feature that allows customers to see how products look in their homes before purchasing them.

Using augmented reality (AR) technology, customers can use their phones to choose from a range of furniture, home décor and bedding products to visualise and view how the products will look.

Unlike virtual reality (VR) that requires headsets to be worn and immerses the user in a digital location, augmented reality brings the digital into the real world through phone cameras.

The technology is easy to use and is helpful in order to see whether certain products will fit in a space or if it matches other objects in the room

Customers can access the feature through the k-labs page on the Kmart website and use their phones to choose products and digitally place them in their homes.

The digitalised items can be moved and turned in order to fit in the desired place in a room.

Currently on the site shoppers can choose from Kmart's popular rattan cupboards along with side tables, lamps, cushions and ottomans.

The technology is easy to use and is helpful in order to see whether certain products will fit in a space or if it matches other objects in the room.

It will also assist those who are looking to redecorate and style their homes differently.    

A KBot assistant is available to provide shoppers with product dimensions, colour and material details. 

Prices are also listed beside the image of each product.  

'The immersive AR and AI experience was designed to bring joy and inspiration to customers' lives,' said Kmart head of digital Melissa Wong.

'With extra help from our AI chatbot personality – KBot assist – we have been able to make shopping easier for customers by sprinkling delight across the customer journey,' she said.
