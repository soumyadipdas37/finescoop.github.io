Roman Fury, brother of heavyweight champion Tyson, has become a professional boxer, making him the ninth person to turn pro in the Gypsy King's family.

WBC champion Fury has been training alongside his 23-year-old brother during lockdown and, despite having no amateur background in the sport, Roman has turned professional. 

Roman had been looking to take a different path to his champion brother, but has taken up boxing after spending months training with Tyson.

The 23-year-old (2L) has been training with Tyson in lockdown and is ready to go professional

'Just signing him [Roman] up now, he's 23-years-old, he's an aspiring cruiserweight champion of the future,' Tyson told iFL TV. 

'Southpaw, tall, 6ft 2ins, in good shape. We're gonna try and get him – when the boxing starts again – maybe four or five fights within the boxing season and keep him busy for the next couple of years.

'He's learning on the job, like Canelo was. Gonna get him to about 20-0 before we move him up.

Roman's brother Tommy is a high-profile Fury having been a star on hit TV show Love Island

'He's 23, nearly 24. Hasn't had any amateur fights, but he's been around the game a long time so born and bred into it.

'We'll get him a few fights and see how he goes on. Sugar Hill's teaching him that Kronk style, he's learning.'

Of the Fury clan, brother Tommy and cousin Hughie are the high-profile relatives of Tyson. Tommy, 21, is 3-0 in his light heavyweight career but earned fame as a Love Island star.

Meanwhile, Hughie has been around the blocks and came close to winning the WBO heavyweight championship when he lost on points to Joseph Parker in 2017.

'When lockdown happened I had nothing else to do,' Roman said. 'I had no work on, as many people didn't, and I had the opportunity to go and train.

'So I did it, got fit, lost a bit of weight and I just fell in love with it. I thought, 'I've always wanted to do it, so why not now?'

'So I've put everything on hold and I'm gonna give it my best and see how we go…It's like an experiment, I wanna see how far I can go.

'Just started it now at 23, but it's all about self-belief and I do have a lot of that.'
