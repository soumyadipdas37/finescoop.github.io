A Queensland snake catcher has issued a warning to the public after capturing a huge red belly after it slithered through a school.

Stuart McKenzie from Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers said his last few weeks have been 'ridiculous' after catching several enormous reptiles in snake breeding season.

The experienced catcher told Daily Mail Australia he had seen a number of large adult snakes on the move through the region.

'It's been hectic,' Mr McKenzie said. 'It's that time of year. All the big adult snakes are out and about and mating and all the boys are fighting each other.'

Mr McKenzie was called to relocate an enormous red belly black snake on Friday after it snuck its way through the playground to the back of a school.

'It was very big for a red belly,' he said. 'A good four-and-a-half to five foot and fat and chunky.

'The teachers did a great job of keeping the kids away.'

Mr McKenzie estimated the snake was around eight-years-old and among a wealth of elder snakes travelling about on the Sunshine Coast lately.

'Everyone's coming out to play,' he said.

He posted a video on his Facebook page on Monday after discovering a whopping carpet python underneath a garbage bin in Nambour.

'The snakes just keep getting bigger,' Mr McKenzie captioned the video.

'It is pretty crazy how this big snake somehow fit under the small wheelie bin. This is one of the biggest carpet pythons I've caught in years!'

Mr McKenzie warned Queenslanders to keep an eye out for any more big snakes during breeding season.

'If you find a snake, first thing you should do is get all people, kids and pets away from the snake,' he said.

'If you want to relocate it, keep an eye on it from a safe distance and give your local snake catcher a call.'
