Chelsea have rejected offers from Inter Milan for N'Golo Kante involving Christian Eriksen and Marcelo Brozovic.

Chelsea would rather sell Jorginho ahead of Kante and have no interest in Eriksen or Brozovic.

Antonio Conte has been eyeing up a move to reunite with Kante, who he brought to Stamford Bridge from Leicester four years ago.

Chelsea have rejected an approach from Inter Milan for their midfielder N'Golo Kante

Eriksen, who only joined Inter from Tottenham in the January transfer window, has been in and out of the side under Conte. 

Jorginho has struggled to make himself a prominent part of Frank Lampard's future plans at Chelsea.

The Italian midfielder followed former boss Maurizio Sarri to Chelsea from Napoli in the summer of 2018. 

Earlier on Thursday Michy Batshuayi completed his move to Crystal Palace on loan.
