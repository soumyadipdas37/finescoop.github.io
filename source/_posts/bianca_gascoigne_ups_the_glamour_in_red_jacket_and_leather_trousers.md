They recently returned from their first holiday together in Croatia.

And Bianca Gascoigne put on a loved-up display with her boyfriend Kris Boyson as they enjoyed a date night at The M Kitchen in Bexley, London, on Saturday. 

The model, 33, upped the glamour in a red jacket with zip detailing and leather trousers as she headed into the eatery.

She completed the going-out look with yellow peep-toe heels and a large black leather bag.

The blonde beauty wore her light tresses in loose waves over her shoulders and pulled together the whole ensemble with a slick of red lip. 

Meanwhile Kris showed off his gym-honed physique in a tight black t-shirt and ripped grey jeans.

Bianca recently revealed she moved in with her personal trainer beau Kris after their first date in a interview. 

The couple took their relationship to the next level as they spent the UK's nationwide lockdown together just weeks after embarking on a romance. 

Despite dating for only five months, the reality stars admitted they'd definitely want to get married and start a family in the future as they 'completely trust' each other.

Katie Price's ex told new! magazine: 'We've spent every single day together practically since we met. 

'You wouldn't lock down with someone for 100 days if it was a showmance.'  

Bianca and Kris were introduced to each other three years ago when he provided her with healthy meals in preparation of a charity fight, which got cancelled when her opponent, his ex Katie Price, pulled out.

They lost contact for a while, before fitness enthusiast Kris slid into her Instagram DMs earlier this year. 

The couple currently reside in Kent and are renovating their pad with a cinema room and a new bar. 

When asked about the prospect of marriage and kids, influencer Bianca admitted their future looks 'very promising' and her mother Sheryl Gascoigne is 'desperate for grandchildren'.
