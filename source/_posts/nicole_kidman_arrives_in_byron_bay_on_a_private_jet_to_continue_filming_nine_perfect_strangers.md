Nicole Kidman has arrived back in Byron Bay, New South Wales, as she continues filming her $100million production of Nine Perfect Strangers.

The 53-year-old, who has been flying in and out of the coastal town since production began in August, was all smiles as she touched down via private jet on Tuesday.  

Dressed in a blue button-up shirt, white T-shirt and khaki trousers, the Hollywood star looked effortlessly stylish as she disembarked the aircraft to meet a waiting chauffeur.

Her look was completed with a white leather handbag and a pair of flat sandals.
