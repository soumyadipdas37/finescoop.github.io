Maya Hawke was seen heading to dinner with Jesse Harris on Thursday evening in New York City.

The 22-year-old Stranger Things actress and the 50-year-old music producer have worked together on her new album Blush. The two then joined her actor father Ethan Hawke for an al fresco dinner.

There was no sign of the budding star's rumoured love interest, British actor Tom Sturridge, whom she was seen with earlier this summer.

Maya looked fashionable in a beautiful black and gold brocade button-up jacket with a short collar and long sleeves that looked very warm.

She added loose-fitting denim boyfriend jeans that were rolled up on the bottom as well as white sneakers with a generous sole. 

There was a long strapped purse on her shoulder and she had a face mask pulled down revealing she was makeup free as she pulled her brunette hair up, away from her face.

Harris, who co-wrote and produced the album Blush, was in a red-and-white shirt with khaki slacks and beige sneakers and a black mask pulled down to his chin.

He is best known for the albums Songs Never Sung, Sub Rosa and Aquarelle.

He was wed to Uma from 1998 until 2005. Together they have not only Maya but also 18-year-old son Levon Roan.

She released her first album Blush in August

In 2008 he wed Ryan Shawhughes  with whom her has children Indiana, aged nine, and 12-year-old Clementine.

Earlier this week Maya revealed she had dyslexia in an interview with NPR. 

'I would say it is, like, one of the great blessings of my life in a lot of ways,' said she when asked if she 'suffers' from dyslexia. 

The star admitted she did get 'kicked out of school for not being able to read when I was a kid.'

She added: 'I went to a special school for kids with learning disabilities. And it took me a long time to learn how to read, and I still am limited.

'But the wonderful thing about today's world is that there are so many options. There's something about having had a limitation in regards to my ability to produce and take in stories that made me even more determined to love them and understand them and grow in them,' she added.

His ladies: He was wed to Uma, left, from 1998 until 2005. Together they have not only Maya but also 18-year-old son Levon Roan (seen in 2001). In 2008 he wed Ryan Shawhughes, right, with whom her has children Indiana, aged nine, and 12-year-old Clementine (seen in 2018)

The actress and singer also said that, 'it was deeply difficult, you know, to be in the slow class.'

Maya added: 'Every grade that went by, you get dropped down into a lower and lower reading group.'

Hawke also said that other kids would find out about being in the lower classes and there was bullying, 'but my parents did a wonderful job of encouraging me to be creative.'

She added that her father Ethan directed the music video for her song Coverage, which was made at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

'COVID had just really hit. So I made - I did these live videos with my family,' she began.

No there: There was no sign of the budding star's rumoured love interest, British actor Tom Sturridge, whom she was seen with earlier this summer. Here he is seen with ex-fiancee Sienna Miller in December 2013

'But people call it a music video, I think, because, like, my dad is such a special filmmaker that even with, like, an iPhone and 10 minutes to prepare and me being, like, everyone we're going to play the song in the barn; like, Dad, will you make a video? - his brain turns on and he goes, OK,' Hawke added of her father.

She added that the title of her album Blush came from a lyric in the song Coverage, which she added is the only song on the album about acting.

'But where the title really comes from for me is about this idea of embarrassment. Most people wouldn't describe me as a particularly shameful or shy person. But I actually walk through my life feeling tremendously embarrassed most of the time - that I talked too loud at a party or said something stupid or, you know, whatever it is,' she shared.

'So that's part of what it means. And the other part of what it means is that blush is simultaneously a revealing thing. Like, when you blush, you're revealing something about yourself, something personal. And it's also a mask, like if you put on blush or makeup. It's a mask. It hides your face, your feelings,' Hawke continued.

Deeply difficult: The actress and singer also said that, 'it was deeply difficult, you know, to be in the slow class'; seen in Stranger Things with Joe Keery as Steve Harrington
