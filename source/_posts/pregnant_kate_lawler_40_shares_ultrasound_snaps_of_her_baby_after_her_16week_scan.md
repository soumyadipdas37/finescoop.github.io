Kate took to Instagram on Sunday to share the happy news that she is expecting a baby with her fiancé Martin, and confirmed she's due in February 2021.

Speaking with Hello! magazine, Kate explained that they started trying for a baby after their wedding was rearranged twice due to the coronavirus pandemic, before it was cancelled altogether. 

Kate added that the pregnancy was 'completely planned' and that she's 'never felt more ready' to be a mum.

She explained: 'The wedding got cancelled and I wasn't thinking about a baby at all.

'But when we rebooked it for the following year, a few of our friends and family said we could have a baby between now and then.

'I laughed, but then I turned 40 in May and suddenly I felt grown up and like I was ready for something and I didn't know what it was.' 

The 2002 Big Brother winner also said she had felt 'pressurised' in the past but is happy that she waited for the right time.

Kate added: 'I think I am going to be a much happier person knowing that I did this when I wanted to.'  

Exciting! She took to Instagram on Sunday to share the happy news that she is expecting a baby with her fiancé Martin, and confirmed she's due in February 2021
