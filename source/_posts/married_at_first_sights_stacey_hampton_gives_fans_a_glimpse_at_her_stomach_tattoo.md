Stacey Hampton gave fans their biggest peek yet at her often talked about, but rarely seen stomach tattoo on Thursday.

In a video posted to Instagram, the 26-year-old former Married At First Sight star modelled a series of bikinis.

Posing from a variety of different angles, Stacey showed off her many tattoos, including a woman's face on the side of her left thigh.

On the front of her right thigh, she has what appears to be a row of three butterflies in flight.

But most prominent is her stomach tattoo, with the former reality star having previously spoken about its significance.  

In a YouTube video back in April, Stacey revealed that she got the eye-catching tattoo as a tribute to her late brother.

'My stomach tattoo is very sentimental. When my brother died, I was pregnant with my firstborn. So after he was born I got a tribute on my stomach,' she explained.

She confessed people will often ask her about the intricate tattoo, even though she tries to 'hide' it. 

The tattoo features a geometric design, with her brother's name scrawled in the middle, above the words 'forever young'.

Stacey explained that she's self-conscious about the tattoo because it's so deeply personal, and admitted she tries to keep it covered up.

'I may or may not post a close-up one day, but it's very sentimental to me. Even with bikinis, I'll wear a one-piece or put a sarong over it,' she added at the time. 

Stacey is a single mum to two young sons, Kosta, five, and Kruz, three.
