A man's mistake about the sea tides left him and his boat stranded for hours.  

When the tide went down, his boat became accidentally lodged on an oyster bed in Hilton Head, South Carolina. 

He had no option but to wait until the tide returned again to free him and his boat. 

The man was spotted by two kayakers who filmed a video of the incident which took place on September 26.  

The video shows the scene where a boat is unusually moored on high ground in the middle of the bay.

The camera zooms in on the stranded boat which just shows the man sitting alone in the bow of the boat.

A man stranded in his boat on an oyster bed in South Carolina was spotted by two kayakers who filmed a video of the incident which took place on September 26

The kayaker approaches the boat and jokes: '[If] you're going to be up there you may as well have a banjo.'

The man in the boat simply laughs in reply.  

'You alright?' the kayaker asks him. 

'Well, it was quiet,' quips the man, indicating that he would prefer not to talk to anyone.

The man in the kayak explained the situation saying, 'My wife and I were on a morning kayak trip.  

'You alright?' the kayaker asks him. 'Well, it was quiet,' quips the man, indicating that he would prefer not to talk to anyone about his embarrassing situation 

'About halfway into the trip, we came across this man who had lodged his boat on an oyster bed as the tide was going down.  

'Although his situation looked bad, he seemed to enjoy the peace, quiet and downtime.' 

Coastal areas experience two high and two low tides every day.

High tides occur just over 12 hours apart and it takes over six hours for the water at the shore to go from high to low, or from low to high.

At that rate, the man has got a while left to wait!
