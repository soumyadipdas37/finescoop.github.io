Riverdale's Camila Mendes confirmed her relationship with Grayson Vaughan on Instagram with a PDA-filled shot of them tenderly embracing on Thursday. 

'That long distance kind of love,' the 26-year-old actress captioned a picture of herself with both arms wrapped around the model's neck in front of a private plane.

While the lovebirds have been seen numerous times throughout quarantine, it appears they'll now be a plane ride away as she resumes filming on her CW drama.

Her kissing post, which she tagged Vaughan in, comes seven months after Mendes broke up with her costar Charles Melton after a year of dating in December.

Her announcement garnered responses from her Riverdale costar Madelaine Petsch, who wrote, 'I'm not crying!!! You are!!!' 

Additionally, 13 Reasons Why's Katherine Langford commented she was happy for Mendes, while Tommy Dorfman gushed: 'FINALLY PUBLIC'

She will be joining her longtime pal Lili Reinhart on set, who recently described feeling 'like a prisoner' for having to return north of the border to film their popular series in a new Nylon profile. 

Lili has said she's less than thrilled about the idea, as it means she 'cannot leave Canada' and won't be able to visit her family for Thanksgiving in November.

She also lamented having to fit into a prom dress she wore in an episode before filming was halted, because she's 'a little bit thicker' than she was before the pandemic.

'We stopped during the prom episode, so I have to fit back in that prom dress. Five months later, we're all going to be tan, maybe a little bit thicker. I certainly am,' she said.

'I genuinely feel like a prisoner, going back to work, because I cannot leave Canada. That doesn't feel good. You can't go home for Thanksgiving, can't visit your family. No one can come visit you unless they quarantine for two weeks. It just feels f*****.'

Despite her grievances, Lili acknowledged she is 'very lucky' to have the show to return to as other people have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic.
