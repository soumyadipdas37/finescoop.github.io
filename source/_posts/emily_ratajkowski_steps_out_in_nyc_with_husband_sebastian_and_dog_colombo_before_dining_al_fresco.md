Emily Ratajkowski recently hit out against photographer Jonathan Leder with allegations of sexual misconduct in a soul-baring essay for The Cut. 

But on Sunday the model, 29, looked light and in good spirits as she and her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard, 39, stepped out with their dog Colombo to get a bite to eat. 

Dining al fresco, the pair seemed to radiate happiness as they laughed and chatted while enjoying each others company.

With cooler temperatures hitting, the bombshell model made sure to layer up as the pair enjoyed their weekend outing.

Emily wore an ankle-length black dress and a pair of new balance sneakers as she topped her look off with a beige trenchcoat. 

Carrying a red crocodile purse with a light gold chain, the brunette stunner put her locks up in a loose updo, accessorizing the look with a pair of gold hoop earrings.

The pair who split time in quarantine between their home in Los Angeles and a Hamptons property with their pooch, seemed excited to be back to the fast pace bustle of the city. 

They sipped on some coffee and strolled around, clad in sunglasses and masks as they enjoyed the pleasant day. 

Though the Inamorata designer seemed to be carefree, the outing comes pretty fresh off the release of her bombshell essay titled Buying Myself Back.  

The Cut: Emily wrote an essay called Buying Myself Back where she detailed her journey starting out as a model and alleges sexual misconduct against photographer Jonathan Leder

In the essay, Emily talks about not having control over her own image as a model as well as power struggles between artist and subject. 

In detailing some of her personal experiences on the path to stardom, Emily notably reveals disturbing details surrounding a photoshoot in the Catskills with photographer Jonathan Leder in 2012. 

At the time the young model was an unknown and was told by her agent that the shoot would be good for her image. 

The model bought a train ticket and prepared for an overnight photoshoot at Leder's private home upstate before ending up in a situation she had not asked for. 

Upon arrival, the model alleges that she was plied with copious amounts of red wine before a nude photoshoot, eventually losing consciousness to wake up with 'his fingers suddenly inside of [her]'. 

Under fire: Jonathan Leder is now under fire after the release of Emily's essay. His publishing company has issued statements on his behalf calling the model 'vindictive' and claiming her allegations are false

Gone Girl: Leder chose to publish her polaroids in a book costing $80, some of which were 'the most revealing and vulgar' photos after Emily started to gain success after the movie Gone Girl

Years later after Emily had reached fame, Leder chose to publish her Polaroids in a book costing $80, some of which were 'the most revealing and vulgar' photos from their 2012 shoot. 

The situation left Emily fearing for her career and feeling violated, as she watched her book of nudes sell out three times over. 

The incident sparked legal dealings as Emily said she never once gave her consent for any images to be published, as the opposing sides battled it out in 2016.  

Lawyers for Leder and Imperial publishing maintained their innocence, saying:

 'We do not feel that we should be bullied by a celebrity though, and cease publication because she has decided that the photographs are no longer in her best interest.'

They added that they had 'every legal right to publish [their] books'.

Vindictive: Leder's team alleges that all claims were falsified in a desperate ploy; Emily pictured in March 2020

Emily revealed that even four years later she still contemplates selling a portrait of herself from Richard Prince - an image she also felt no ownership of - to use the money to sue Jonathan. 

After her revealing essay, Leder and his publishing company have retorted back, calling the A-list celebrity 'vindictive'.

In their defending statement's Jonathan's team went on the record to say, 'Mr. Leder totally denies her outrageous allegations of being 'assaulted.' It is grotesque and sad that she is so vindictive to lie in such a way to the press routinely.'

Since then he has gone completely rogue, deactivating his social media amidst the unfolding scandal.
