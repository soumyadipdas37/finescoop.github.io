James Corden has told that there is 'absolutely no truth' in rumours of him 'replacing' talk show host Ellen DeGeneres after she has done the job 'so outrageously well'.  

The Late Late Show host, 42,  put the record straight in a game of Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts with the If I Ain't Got You hitmaker Alicia Keys, 39, on Wednesday. 

James revealed how he 'genuinely' did not know where the rumour 'even came from' and said it would be 'really crazy' to take over from Ellen, 62, who has hosted the show since 2003.  

Speculation: James Corden, 42, has told that there is 'absolutely no truth' in rumours of him 'replacing' talk show host Ellen DeGeneres after she has done the job 'so outrageously well' on Wednesday 

Alicia and James were sat at opposite ends of a long table and were presented with three stomach-churning dishes under serving domes for the talk show segment. 

In the second round, James chose to answer the question instead of eating the unknown dish which turned out to be hot sauce and olive jelly. 

The songstress said: 'There were articles over the summer that said you may be replacing Ellen was there any truth to it and would you ever consider it? Answer the question.' 

Praise: James revealed how he 'genuinely' did not know where the rumour 'even came from' and said it would be 'really crazy' to take over from Ellen, 62, who has hosted the show since 2003

James, who has fronted the late night American talk show since 2015, replied: 'That is a very...happily I will answer it because I don't even know where, genuinely I don't know where that even came from. 

'I think somebody started a rumour somewhere and someone jumped on it. There is absolutely no truth in that story at all - zero.' 

He continued:  'And as far as considering it, I think it would be a really crazy thing to take over from someone who I think has done the job so outrageously well for like 18 years. 

'So - it's not true and I think when the day comes to end this show will be the day to stop hosting a show everyday.' 

Open: During her opening monologue, the TV star said she is 'starting a new chapter' with her talk show following the controversy

Over the last few months, Ellen has faced allegations that she treated staffers with little or no respect and that senior producers allowed and encouraged a toxic work environment. 

On Monday, the comedian kicked off the 18th season of her daytime talk show by telling her virtual audience she was 'taking responsibility' for the scandal, while also acknowledging she was not the behind-the-scenes villain that several reports had suggested.

In Ellen's apology, she said: 'I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realise that with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.'

Later, she added: 'The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad. I get mad. I get anxious. I get frustrated.  

'I get impatient. And I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress.

'And I am especially working on the impatience thing. And it's not going well because it's not happening fast enough, I will tell you that.'

The allegations against Ellen include that she oversaw a workplace which fostered racism, sexual misconduct and bullying. She has apologised to staff privately in a conference call.

The show also faced additional accusations of sexual misconduct when dozens of men and women accused Kevin Leman, Ed Glavin and Jonathan Norman of harassment, misconduct or assault.

Leman and Norman denied the claims. They and Glavin were promptly suspended while Warner Bros. launched an investigation. 

Leman's attorney said at the time that he was being made a scapegoat.  

'Oh boy, welcome to season 18 of the Ellen DeGeneres show. If you're watching because you love me, thank you, if you're watching because you don't love me, welcome! 

'How was everybody's summer? Good? Mine was great. Super terrific. I am so happy to be back in the studio. There are a lot of things I want to talk about. I've been looking forward to addressing it all directly and unfortunately talking directly to people has been illegal for six months so I a virtual audience here instead, here you all are. You look beautiful and I am sure you smell great, that's what I am imagining anyway.

'All right, let's get to it. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show and then there was an investigation. 

'I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realize that with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show. 

'This is the Ellen DeGeneres show, I am Ellen DeGeneres, my name is there, my name is there, my name is on underwear... we have had a lot of conversations over the last few weeks about our show, our workplace and what we want for the future. 

'We have made the necessary changes and today we are starting a new chapter. There were also articles in the press and on social media that said I am not who I appear to be on TV because I became known as the be kind lady and here's how that happened. 

'I started saying be kind to one another after a young man named Tyler Clementi took his own life after being bullied for being gay. I thought the world needed more kindness and it was a reminder that we all needed that.

'I think we need it more than ever right now. Being known as the be kind lady is a tricky position to be in. Let me give you some advice out there, if anybody is thinking of changing their title or giving yourself a nickname, do not go with the 'be kind lady'. Don't do it. 

'The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad. I get mad. I get anxious. I get frustrated. I get impatient. And I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress. And I am especially working on the impatience thing. And it's not going well because it's not happening fast enough I will tell you that. 

'Listen, I don't know. I'm a talk show host but maybe some of you know that I was an actress. I've played a straight woman in movies so I'm a pretty good actress but I don't think that I'm that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you. 

'This is me and my intention is to always be the best person I can be. If I've ever let someone down, if I've ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that. If that's ever the case I have let myself down and I've hurt myself as well because I always try to grow as a person. I look at everything that comes into my life as an opportunity to learn. I got into this business to make people laugh and feel good. 

'That's my favourite thing to do. That and Jenga. I love that game. And now I am a boss of 270 people. 270 people who help make this show what it is. 270 people who I am so grateful for. All I want is for every single one of them to be happy and be proud to work here. 

'This has been a horrible summer for people all around the world. People are losing their jobs. People are losing loved ones to a pandemic. People are losing their homes and lives in the raging fires that are going on. There's blatant racial injustice all around us. I watch the news and I feel like, where do we even begin? 

'So my hope is that we can still be a place of happiness and joy. I still want to be the one hour a day where people can go to escape and laugh. I want to continue to help the people that we help every day. And I am committed to making this the best season that we have ever had. 

'So welcome to season 18 of the Ellen Show. I am so glad that you are here. I want to start the new season by saying hello to my friend Twitch.

'You are not my DJ any more. You are now my co-executive producer. You are such an important part of the show. Unfortunately I had to take the fake DJ equipment away.'
