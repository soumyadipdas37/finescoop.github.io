Crystal Palace have denied reports they have launched a £25 million bid for  Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster.

On Monday morning, Sky Sports reported that Palace had submitted an offer of £19m plus £6m in add ons, while inserting a £37m buy-back clause as part of the deal. 

But Palace chairman Steve Parish has now taken to Twitter to dismiss the story and label it a 'total fabrication.'

Brewster is highly rated by Liverpool but the club can't offer him regular first team football

The striker missed a penalty during a rare appearance in Community Shield defeat to Arsenal

He tweeted: 'We have asked Sky to take this down as it is a total fabrication from start to finish. We have not made a bid formal or informal.'

Despite Parish's denials, Palace are believed to be the front runners in the race for the 20-year-old striker.

Reports have also credited up to four other top flight teams with an interest in Brewster, with Newcastle United and Brighton reportedly considering bids and Fulham harbouring hopes of a loan deal. 

Brewster is in demand after scoring 11 goals in 22 appearances during a loan spell at Swansea City last season, which included several stunning strikes.

Klopp is an admirer of 20-year-old but may have to sell him to balance books after signings

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is an admirer of Brewster's talents but can't promise him regular minutes with Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah his first choice attacking trio.

Klopp handed the 20-year-old a rare substitute appearance in extra-time during the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal, but Brewster missed his penalty in the shoot-out. 

That could now be his last appearance in a Reds shirt, with Liverpool accepting that his departure may offer the best solution for all parties. 

Klopp may also have to raise cash after the club spent £66m on Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota last week, with Brewster one of his most saleable assets.

The Reds have been frugal in the transfer market in recent summers prior to their recent outlay and will be wary of balancing the books as Premier League clubs continue to play behind closed doors.
