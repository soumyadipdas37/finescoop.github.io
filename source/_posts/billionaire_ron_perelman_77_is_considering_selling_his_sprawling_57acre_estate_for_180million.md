Billionaire Ron Perelman has reportedly continued to downsize his belongings this month with his 57-acre mansion in East Hampton.

The affluent American banker is reportedly considering offers for his sprawling, palatial home dubbed 'The Creeks' for about $180million, sources to New York Post.

A Perelman spokesperson told the publication that luxurious estate, which sits right near Georgica Pond and is shrouded in privacy, was not for sale 'officially or unofficially.'

But brokers linked to wealthy clients have reportedly gotten indications from Perelman insiders that the property may be available as a 'whisper' listing.

'The Creeks,' is one of the largest estates in the Hamptons, which has an average household income estimated at $155,649 and a median household income of $100,474. 

In East Hampton, the US Census reported that the per capita income in 2018 was $68,386. 

Perelman, the 77-year-old Chairman of Revlon, has hosted a plethora of celebrities from Jon Bon Jovi to Jennifer Hudson perform at the estate for his annual Apollo in the Hamptons bash. 

The floors are still splattered with paint drippings from the legendary artist Jackson Pollack from when 'The Creeks' was much more of an artists colony. 

Although noted for it's gorgeous exterior and appeal, the home took some damage two years ago when an attic fire sparked. 

The East Hampton home was the site of Perelman's (pictured)  annual Apollo in the Hamptons event where celebrities performed 

Perelman was not home at the time and, fortunately, no one was injured by the frightening inferno. The fire was contained to the third-floor of the home.

It appeared that Perelman's extensive art collection remained unscathed. His collection includes pieces by the famous Andy Warhol and sculptures from Jeff Koons.

A source told NY Post that there could be multiple reasons for the alleged home sale.

'He was sick and had an operation on his leg. Maybe this is part of estate planning. You just don’t know. But this is a pre-vaccine Covid market and the impact and reach of it is worldwide,' they said. 

His daughter Samantha, from his second wife and Page Six editor Claudia Cohen, has also reportedly offered up her beautiful East Hampton mansion for $150million.

The estate, which is nestled on 8.5 acres, is where Samantha celebrated her 30th birthday and lived during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The home has 'all the bells and whistles' like a tennis court, pool and spacious lawn, sources told NY Post.

'I was supposed to see it yesterday but it was raining — and it is way overpriced,' said one broker.

The supposed sale comes as the businessman continued to do away with his assets amid gossiping from Wall Street to Washington D.C. about the fairly recent decision.

He sold his enormous 70 per cent stake in Humvee maker AM General last July, in addition to his $37.3million auction for paintings by Joan Miro and Henri Matisse.

Perelman sought help from Goldman Sachs in 2019 to 'explore strategic alternatives' for Revlon's finances after $3billion in loans was due.  

He's also reportedly considered to drop his 39 per cent share in Scientific Games, which provides gambling products to casinos, and Perelman has already sold The Independent, a popular East Hampton paper in June.  

Meanwhile, Perelman's net worth has plummeted from $20million in 2018 to $4.55billion,NY Post reports.

But Perelman has attempted to quiet rumors last month with a rare statement published in Vanity Fair, where he explained that he wanted a 'less complicated and less leveraged business life.'

That 'would allow me to focus on what I love most about MacAndrews & Forbes Inc., seek new investment opportunities, as well as allow me to have better and more present time with my family,' he said.

'A simpler life, with less running around and more time with my family, including homeschooling our youngest children, has energized me and taught me new things. 

'For the future, I will spend my time more with my family and all my children, seeking new investment opportunities, and running our companies.'
