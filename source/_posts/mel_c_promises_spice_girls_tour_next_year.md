Melanie Chisholm, aka Mel C, has promised that the Spice Girls will finally tour Australia next year. 

Speaking to Stellar Magazine this week, the 46-year-old performer, known as Sporty Spice, says the girl group cannot wait to head Down Under.   

'That is very high on my list of priorities, if not at the very top,' she says of coming to Australia.

'Myself and Melanie [Mel B] constantly talk about getting to Australia with the tour. Melanie said it on stage because she so badly wanted it to happen and thought if she just said it then it would definitely have to happen.' 

The singer added added: 'We are talking about doing more shows and I feel like we owe you a show. I'll do my best to make that happen'.

Mel went on to reveal that she has warm memories of being in Australia earlier this year.

'I adore Australia and I think now it has an even more special place in my heart as it was my last place before lockdown. 

'It's my last memory of normality. I will be back as soon as life allows it,' she told the magazine.  

Earlier this year,  Mel C told the This Morning program of a recent reunion at Geri Horner's country abode in which all five of the girls got together for the first time in two years.

On seeing her band mates during lockdown, she said: 'We all went up to Geri's, she's got a lovely place in the countryside and we all hung out. 

'It was all five of us, which is quite a rarity. I think it's been about two years since we were all back together and it was so nice. 

She added: 'We just hung out and reminisced, had a cup of tea and a walk. So it was lovely.'
