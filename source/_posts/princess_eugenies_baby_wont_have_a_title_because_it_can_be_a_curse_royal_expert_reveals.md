Princess Eugenie won't accept a royal title for her baby if offered by the Queen because it is a 'curse' and she wants her child to have an 'ordinary life', a family friend has told Vanity Fair. 

The Queen's granddaughter, 30, and her husband of two years Jack Brooksbank, 34, announced on Friday they are expecting the baby in early 2021. 

A family friend of the couple has now revealed how titles 'don't matter' to the couple, who will raise the child at their home of Kensington Palace, and said they just want 'a happy healthy child.'

Speaking to Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl, the source revealed: 'Eugenie knows that a title can be a curse as well as a blessing and she and Jack want their child to live an ordinary life and eventually work to earn a living.'

Sources also revealed the couple will choose an 'ordinary' name for their first born. 

According to the regulations of the House of Windsor, Eugenie's baby will not automatically be entitled to the HRH styling, which only extends to grandchildren of the monarch. 

The source said even if the Queen offered a title as a gift, it was 'not Eugenie or Jack’s desire; for their child to have a title. 

Despite having royal titles, Princess Eugenie and her sister Princess Beatrice are not currently considered to be senior working royals, because they do not carry out duties full time on behalf of the Queen.

A family friend of the couple told Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl that titles 'don't matter' to the couple, who will raise the child at their home of Kensington Palace, and that they just want 'a happy healthy child' (pictured, Eugenie earlier this month) 

The sisters, who are ninth and tenth in line to the throne, both have full time jobs, and do not receive cheques from the Sovereign Grant, the government-supported fund that finances Queen Elizabeth II's official duties. 

Princess Eugenie works as a director for Mayfair-based gallery Hauser & Wirth and receives no money from the Queen. 

King George V - Harry's great, great grandfather - limited titles within the royal family in 1917 as far as grandchildren of the serving monarch.

This means Eugenie's baby is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH or a prince.

George V, speaking in 1917, declared that: 'The grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.' 

Princess Eugenie's cousin Prince Harry did not opt for a title for his and Meghan Markle's son Archie. 

The same is true of Zara Phillip's children, Mia Grace Tindall and Lena Elizabeth Tindall. 

While great-grandchildren are not normally titled HRH or Prince, that privilege does extend to first-born heirs, which is why Prince George was designated as such on in birth in 2012.

In that year, the Queen issued letters that deemed all of Prince William's children would be designated HRH from birth, which is why Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis enjoy those titles. 

Eugenie graduated from Newcastle University in September 2009, after studying English Literature and the History of Art.

After completing her studies, Eugenie moved to New York to work for online auction firm Paddle8, before moving back to London in 2015.

She and her sister currently attend a handful of royal events a year, including occasionally joining the Queen at one of her annual garden parties in the summer, and making an appearance with other royals at Trooping the Colour. 

Meanwhile Jack, who is European brand manager for Casamigos Tequila co-founded by George Clooney  does not have a title or an HRH.  

Eugenie and Jack's child will be 11th in the order of succession, which means the Queen's youngest son Prince Edward will slip down a place into 12th place.  

The baby will be the first grandchild for Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, and will be the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's ninth great-grandchild.  

Sharing the news on Instagram last week, Eugenie wrote: 'Jack and I are so excited for early 2021....,' alongside photos of baby slippers and her and Jack smiling.  

Sarah Ferguson shared her excitement, writing: 'I am so excited by the news that Eugenie and Jack are expecting their first child.

'Thrilled for them both and in my 60th year cannot wait to be a grandmother. Welcoming a new baby into the York family is going to be a moment of profound joy.' 

Eugenie and Jack, who spent lockdown at Fergie and Prince Andrew's home on the Queen's Windsor estate, were last seen on Tuesday night when they joined Princess Beatrice for a night out at private members' club Annabel's. 

Eugenie concealed any hint of a baby bump with a long flowing black top worn under a loose coat that she wore untied at the waist. 

The expectant mother was also recently seen strolling through London on September 18. She looked radiant in a floaty summer dress that skimmed over her midriff and wore a bag slung across her body. 

According to the insider, The couple, who married in a lavish ceremony at Windsor Castle in October 2018, want their child 'to live an ordinary life and eventually work to earn a living'

Her sister Princess Beatrice, who married property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in July, is no doubt excited to become an aunt for the first time. 

The 32-year-old was seen shopping at baby shop The Little White Company earlier this month, perhaps picking up a present for her new niece or nephew. 

Bea donned a face mask as she popped into the store in London, while Edo patiently waited in the car for her - their first public appearance together since their secret wedding in the summer.

The happy news will no doubt be welcomed by grandfather-to-be Prince Andrew, 60, who remains plagued by controversy over his friendship with the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was arrested for her role in allegedly procuring young girls for the financier.
