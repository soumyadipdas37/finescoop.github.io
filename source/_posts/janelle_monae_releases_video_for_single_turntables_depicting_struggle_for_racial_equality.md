Janelle Monáe has released a powerful music video for her new single Turntables, depicting the struggles for racial equality throughout history.

The US hitmaker, 34, donned a traditional grey suit to appear in the video, which features historical footage of protests against police brutality and racial oppression in the US.

Janelle's video will feature in the upcoming documentary All In: The Fight for Democracy, which examines the history of voter oppression in the US and the activists who campaigned for equal rights.

These range throughout history, from the iconic displays of defiance of the 1960s to the recent resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement.
