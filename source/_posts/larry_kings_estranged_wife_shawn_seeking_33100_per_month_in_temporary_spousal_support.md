The estranged wife of talk show host Larry King has filed court documents seeking at least $33,100 per month in temporary spousal support.

Shawn King, 60, claimed in court documents that she has no form of income and wants Larry, 86, to pay her retroactively from August 2019 when he filed for divorce, according to an article Monday by TMZ.

The court documents claimed that Shawn gave up her lucrative TV hosting and modeling jobs as she became a homemaker to raise their children and was financially dependent on the former CNN host during their 22-year marriage.

Shawn in her court filing claimed that Larry earns more than the $1.9 million per year from infomercials that he disclosed in court documents and noted, for example, his recent $5 million podcast deal to host The Millionth Question.

She also disclosed that the former couple made more than $4 million from the sale of their former family home in Beverly Hills.

The home was sold in January for $15.5 million after they bought the five-bedroom, Tuscan-style house in 2007.

Larry filed for divorce in August 2019, just five months after suffering a stroke in March, followed by heart surgery in April. 

The TV personality opened up last month after two of his adult children died weeks apart. His son Andy died on July 28 from a heart attack at age 65 and his daughter Chaia, 52, died in August following a battle with lung cancer.
