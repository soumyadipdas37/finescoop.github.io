Kylie Minogue is preparing to release her fifteenth studio album Disco in November.  

And ahead of the album's release, the pop princess has opened up about how she deals with haters and critics in the public eye. 

'Well, I can’t always shut it out that’s for sure ,' the 52-year-old told Metro this week.

'I think it’s a common part of being an artist or performer,' she continued.

'Doubt can creep in and maybe that’s one of the reasons why I want to keep going. I feel pretty at ease with that now.'

Despite receiving some backlash from music critics in the past, many have hailed Kylie's new single Magic one of the best of her career.

The song is already off to a strong start on digital music charts in Australia and the UK, and has been racking up plenty of streams on Spotify too.

In May, the In Your Eyes hitmaker revealed her hotly anticipated LP - her first since Golden in 2018 - is to feature a set of 'grown-up disco' tracks. 

She said: '[It's] difficult even for me to explain. But even grown-ups need some pure pop fun.' 

Disco music is making a comeback with artists like Doja Cat and Dua Lipa channelling the genre on their recent hits Say So and Don't Start Now respectively.

The Spinning Around hitmaker said of the trend: 'It's all cyclical, right? I loved disco. There's a lot of early 2000s love around at the moment.

'Both feel like good times for me, so I'm channelling that into this record,' she added.

Kylie famously embraced disco during the early 2000s, where she released such iconic tracks as Spinning Around - and wore her infamous gold short-shorts.
