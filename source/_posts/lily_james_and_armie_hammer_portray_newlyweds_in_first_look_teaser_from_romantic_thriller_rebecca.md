In an interview with the Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye, Lily revealed that co-star Kristin Scott Thomas was 'so absolutely terrifying' as scary housekeeper Mrs. Danvers.

In fact, revealed the actress this summer, Lily said she felt compelled to obey her costar's every command while they were filming the new version of Daphne du Maurier's gothic thriller.

'I almost jumped out of a window when she told me to!' Lily admitted, as she spoke about the film adaptation of the classic romantic murder mystery.

Fortunately, the stars enjoyed much light between takes when they weren't inhabiting their characters, all of them oppressed by the shadow of Rebecca.

'Oh, God, we were really hamming it up when we weren't in front of the cameras!' Lily told Baz.

In the film, Armie plays wealthy widower Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley, the sprawling, intimidating mansion haunted by memories of his late wife Rebecca.

When Maxim and Lily's character, the unnamed narrator meet, she is working as a companion to the vulgar Mrs. Van Hopper, portrayed by Ann Dowd.

Key interior scenes were captured at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, while the lush grounds of Manderley were actually filmed at Mapperton, in Dorset.

Rebecca is scheduled to be released on Netflix on October 21.
