She was announced as part of the Dancing With The Stars series 29 line-up earlier this week.  

And Carole Baskin stood out from the crowd as she arrived for her second day of rehearsals in Los Angeles on Friday dressed head-to-toe in animal print. 

As her official portrait for the show was revealed, the Tiger King star, 59, said she's excited for viewers to see the real her and not the 'husband killer' she was made out to be on the hit Netflix documentary.

Carole took a walk on the wild side as she teamed a red leopard print T-shirt with velour trousers. 

On her feet, she wore white plimsolls which had cat faces on them. The Big Cat Rescue owner added to her eccentric outfit with a tiger drawstring rucksack and pink sunglasses. 

Carole took her own spin on her face mask which featured a cat's mouth and whiskers and her signature slogan 'Hey all you cool cats and kittens'.

During a recent appearance on Good Morning America ahead of shooting DWTS, Carole said: 'Tiger King really glamorised animal abusers and villainized me for trying to stop animal abuse, and so I felt really betrayed by that. 

'But what amazed me was how many people believed that false portrayal of me without doing anything to find out who I really am. It's been a nightmare since Tiger King aired.'

The 'false portrayal' to which Baskin refers is the insinuation, in the documentary, that she was responsible for the mysterious disappearance of her second husband Don Lewis in 1997.

Star-studded: Carole will be joined on the new season of Dancing with the Stars by rapper Nelly, Backstreet Boys star AJ McLean, former Desperate Housewives actor Jesse Metcalfe

It's possible that Lewis may have absconded to Costa Rica, but the Tiger King filmmakers gave considerable screen time to wild theories and accusations that Carole fed him to her tigers, or hid his body in a septic tank, or both. 

Carole said she wants to take the focus away from her feud with Joe Exotic, and focus on animal rights and welfare, especially when it comes to big cats.

'The longer my partner and I can stay in the running and in the competition it will keep the cats forefront in the viewer's eye and to me that was where Tiger King missed the ball - it really should have been focused on the animals,' she continued on GMA. 

'I am competitive, but I am competitive with myself. I want to do the very best that I can possibly do.'

Carole will be joined on the new season of Dancing with the Stars by rapper Nelly, Backstreet Boys star AJ McLean, former Desperate Housewives actor Jesse Metcalfe, Disney Channel star Skai Jackson, and Return To Paradise actress Anne Heche.

The new season premieres on ABC on Monday, September 14th.
