More than 10,000 students and staff returning to the University of Leicester in the coming days will be screened for coronavirus and tracked on campus via a compulsory phone app.

The university said it was 'one of the few' academic institutions in the UK carrying out screening of students and staff who are not showing symptoms.

SafeZone, an app students will be required to have on their mobile phones, will tell university authorities when they are on campus.

As with other universities, all mass social gatherings will be banned and enforced by 'serious police action', with students staying in 'live and learn bubbles' while studying online.

Face masks will be required inside and students will also be forced to use the NHS Test and Trace app.

Students will be provided with a health pack upon arrival onto campus, Leicester University said.

Up to 4,000 students across Britain are now self-isolating for a fortnight after more than 500 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed across at least 47 universities. 

Leicester is in a state of lockdown, with people banned from hosting people from outside their own household in their houses or garden.

The map of Britain's coronavirus rules: As confusion reigns, where can you meet friends for a pint inside or outside? And will the lockdown police ask you for a 'reasonable excuse'?

During the summer, the entire campus has been given a makeover with a wide range of one-way systems, new signs showing maximum occupancy levels for each room, as well as hand sanitiser dispensers.

Professor Nishan Canagarajah, president and vice-chancellor of the university, said: 'As the next academic year draws closer, we are welcoming a cohort whose mettle has already been proven through the chaos of the A-level fallout.

'We are going all out to make sure they have a rich and rewarding experience as they start the next stage in their life during a pandemic.

'We will keep them — and the Leicester community — safe in multiple ways, including the introduction of a new screening for more than 10,000 staff and students.

'Our students are individuals, not numbers. It's our job as educators and as a country in recession to lay the groundwork for every students to concentrate on achieving their best to forge a better future for them and society as a whole.'

Professor Ivan Browne, Leicester's Director of Public Health, urged all students to follow the rules. He said: 'We are very pleased to welcome new and returning students to Leicester, and hope they enjoy their time here despite the very different circumstances.

'It's very important that they follow the rules and guidelines that will help to keep them and their families safe, and I'm pleased that the University of Leicester has clear plans in place to help them to do this.'

All freshers' activities are being run virtually this year, and the university is working with its students' unions to ensure that students do not attend mass social gatherings.

Meeting outside and in pubs is allowed, but only under the Rule of Six. All pubs and restaurants in the region must close at 10pm.

Venues are now 'legally required' to take and keep the contact details of a member from every group of visitors for 21 days. This is so they can pass them on to NHS Test and Trace 'without delay' if needed.

The hospitality venue could face a fine if it fails to stick to the Covid security standards and the Government pledged to back local authorities to make 'further and faster use of their powers' against venues who break the rules. 

Covid-19 secure venues, such as places of worship, restaurants and hospitality venues, can still host larger numbers in total but groups of up to six must not mix or form larger groups. 

Leicester is the only area in the country that has had to remain under addition measures since the rest of the country was lifted from lockdown on July 4.

Vulnerable residents have been told to remain shielding until October 5. After this date formal shielding will be paused in the area, and Leicester City Council will take over advising the local population on what to do.

The Rule of Six limit does not apply to strangers gathering in the same space, such as a train or bus.

Government guidelines say: 'You can help control coronavirus and travel safely by walking and cycling, if you can. However, where this is not possible, you can use public transport or drive. 

'If you do use public transport, you must wear a face covering and you should follow the safer travel guidance for passengers.'

Face coverings have to be worn on public transport, in shops and supermarkets. They are also needed in other indoor venues such as museums, cinemas, galleries and places of worship. 

Hospitality and retail workers now have to wear face coverings at work, as well as passengers in taxis. 

Face masks are not required in schools outside local lockdown areas, but are required for school pupils in Year 7 or above in communal areas in areas where local lockdowns are in place.

The six person limit does not apply to gatherings for work. Offices should take steps to ensure social distancing is maintained.  

Weddings are limited to 15 people and funerals are limited to 30 people. Staff working at these events are not included.
