Maverick No10 chief Dominic Cummings ditched his trademark scruffy style today as the new political term started.

Mr Cummings - who took time off for an undisclosed medical operation recently - donned a smart suit for the first Cabinet meeting called by Boris Johnson after the summer holidays.

It was a stark contrast to his usual work attire, which typically involves a T-shirt and jogging bottoms or jeans.  

The upgrade came as the PM spelled out his desire to get the country back towards 'normality' despite the coronavirus crisis. 

The government is facing a barrage of problems, with children returning to school for the first time since lockdown this week.

Boris Johnson has held his first Cabinet meeting today following the summer holidays

Meanwhile, there is mounting Tory unrest about the handling of the pandemic and the struggle to get workers back in offices, to avert the collapse of town and city centres.

The public finances have been left in tatters by the huge bailouts, but there is fury at briefings suggesting Chancellor Rishi Sunak could raise taxes in the Budget this Autumn.

Experts have warned that efforts to raise revenue now - with one options said to be increasing fuel duty by 5p - could derail any hopes of recovery.

Instead, they suggest the deficit should be allowed to rack up and the books only start being balance in a couple of years.

Mr Cummings has introduced a new 'mission control' style set-up in the Cabinet Office as part of a push to sharpen up the Whitehall machine.

No10 permanent secretary Simon Case was unveiled as the new head of the civil service today - the youngest holder of the post in living memory - with a mandate to force through changes. 

Mr Johnson laid out his 'priorities for the autumn' during the meeting with ministers this morning as the first lessons of the new school year take place.
