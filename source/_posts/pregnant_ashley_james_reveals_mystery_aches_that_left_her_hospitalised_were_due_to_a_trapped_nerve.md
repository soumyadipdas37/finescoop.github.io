Ashley James has revealed that the mystery pains in her side that left her hospitalised over the weekend were due to a severe trapped nerve.        

The DJ, who is five months pregnant with her first child, shared selfies from a maternity ward on Instagram on Saturday night after being admitted as a precaution. 

And on Monday the 33-year-old model took to her Instagram Story to update her followers on what happened, explaining she experienced spasms along her body.

Worried: Ashley James has revealed that the mystery pains in her side that left her hospitalised were due to a severe trapped nerve

Speaking as she put on her makeup, the blonde beauty said: 'Basically I woke up with a really bad pain in one side of my body, shooting from one side of my head down to my legs and I couldn't pinpoint where the pain was on the left side of my tummy.

'I didn't know if it was my back or my kidneys and I have bad kidneys and have been told to stay on high alert with my kidneys throughout my pregnancy.'

She went on to explain that after a couple of hours of struggling, her boyfriend Tom Andrews called 111 and an ambulance was sent to her home.

Honest: Speaking as she put on her makeup the blonde beauty said: 'Basically I woke up with a really bad pain in one side of my body'

She continued: 'At the hospital they did loads of tests to check my kidneys, my blood, my urine but it turns out, we think that it was just a muscle spasm, like a trapped nerve, quite a severe trapped nerve that can be caused either by working out or the baby moving around.'

Ashley signed off by saying that her midwife had recommended her a physio that does acupuncture that could help her during the rest of her pregnancy. 

In a caption on her Instagram she also explained that the doctors told her it was 'better to be safe than sorry' and that she had 'honestly never experienced pain like that'.   

Speaking about the incident earlier on Monday, Ashley thanked her boyfriend Tom for waiting outside the hospital for 10 hours. 

Tom, 30, had been forced to wait outside as hospitals reduce the number of people allowed on wards amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Keeping her fans in the loop, Ashley shared a snap in her hospital bed as she penned: 'Eventful night to mark 23 weeks. Suffered the worst pain down my left side. 

'A call to 111 resulted in an ambulance and now I'm in the maternity ward of mu hospital. Lucky baby is ok and I've heard his little heart. 

'Tommy's not allowed in due to Covid but has waited outside all evening. I'm doing much better but just awaiting tests results [sic].  Very very grateful to the NHS, especially my amazing ambulance duo. 

Mother-to-be: The DJ is five months pregnant with her first child. Last month, she discovered she is expecting a baby boy, which is due in January 2021

The former Made In Chelsea star went on to reveal how 'excited' she is to meet her little boy when he arrives, musing, 'always got to see the positives and things to be grateful for'.  

Revealing that Tom had been allowed in to bring some snacks and to help her leave the building after she'd been discharged, Ashley then shared a sweet selfie of the pair. 

She penned: 'And I'm out of hospital. Thank you for all for the love, everything is well. I'm ok and most importantly baby's ok, I've just got to rest now. The NHS were just amazing. 

'Also shout out to this guy [Tom] who waited 10 hours outside of the hospital despite me telling him to go home and sleep.'

After spending the night in hospital, Ashley was allowed home in the early hours of Sunday morning and revealed she was resting and recuperating with her pets.    

She explained: 'I've got really strong painkillers, not exactly sure what it was, but at least all the tests are fine.

'I'm just gutted because we were meant to be going to Whitstable for the day. Obviously there are more important things and I'm just happy that the baby's ok... Thank you all for the love.'

The influencer went on to praise her boyfriend Tom for all his help during the crisis, admitting that she struggled to wrap her head around having him there because she is so used to being single. 

She mused: 'Having a boyfriend is still a novelty, I was single for six years. It's just such an alien concept or a novelty that someone would wait outside of a hospital for so long... 

'I definitely do not take for granted him. But I'm also very proud of myself for all the work that I did to get to a stage to have a healthy relationship, so long may it last.'
