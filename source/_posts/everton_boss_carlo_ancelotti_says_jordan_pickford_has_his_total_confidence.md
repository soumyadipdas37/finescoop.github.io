Carlo Ancelotti has backed under-fire Jordan Pickford by saying Everton have no interest in signing a new goalkeeper.

Reports on Friday suggested the Toffees are considering a move for Manchester United's Sergio Romero after England No 1 Pickford made a series of errors.

But Ancelotti says Pickford has his 'total confidence' and described him as a 'great goalkeeper.'

Speaking ahead of Everton’s trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday, Ancelotti said: ‘There is a lot of focus on him but, I have to be honest, he started really well and did a fantastic match against Tottenham.

‘I am not really focused on him, like you. He is a great goalkeeper. He has my total confidence.’

Asked whether Everton intended to bring in a new goalkeeper, the Italian replied: ‘We are not looking for this.’
