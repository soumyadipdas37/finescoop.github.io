Keith Urban and Pink virtually performed their new track, One Too Many, for the first time at the 55th annual Academy of Country Music Awards show.  

The country superstar, 52, and the 41-year-old hitmaker performed their regret-filled country pop ballad, which became available on Tuesday. 

For their performance, the Australian singer donned an opened button-down, black V-neck tank and flaunted his impeccable guitar skills.

Meanwhile, his Grammy-award collaborator sported a bulky, black leather jacket over a flowing white gown, with a floral pattern. 

'I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah / In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone / And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?' the performers sang virtually during the world television premiere of the song. 

They continued to croon: 'I know I'm proud / But I've had one too many / Come take me home.'

Earlier this week, Urban spoke about how he has 'always loved Pink’s voice' in a media statement.  

'Her artistry and her multi-faceted ability to create, and her God-given talent, truly makes her one of the greatest voices of our time,' the 15-time ACM Awards winner noted. 

While the global coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns presented challenges for the musicians to collaborate, they are proud of the end result.

Keith and Pink were not only forced to piece together the recording separately, they found themselves at opposite sides of the globe – Pink in Los Angeles and Keith in Sydney – when filming the music video.

The musician returned home to Australia in July with his family as actress wife Nicole Kidman began to film her new mini-series, Nine Perfect Strangers.

In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Keith promoted the release of the track and its official music video.

'[The video] will be coming to you from the middle of the ocean. Serious, literally, with Pink. It will be premiering exclusively on Facebook. I can't wait for you guys to see this video. I think it turned out amazing,' he said.

The pair's video will premiere on Thursday afternoon at 2PM AEST.  

On Wednesday, Urban also served as the CMA's 2020 host and was nominated for male artist of the year category, which was won by Luke Combs.
