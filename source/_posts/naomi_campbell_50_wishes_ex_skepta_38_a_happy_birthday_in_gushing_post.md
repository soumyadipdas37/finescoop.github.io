They are said to have enjoyed a brief romance in 2018, before eventually going on to become close friends.

And Naomi Campbell, 50, showed that she and Skepta continue to remain close on Saturday, when she dedicated a gushing post to the rapper for his 38th birthday.

The stunning supermodel shared a series of throwback snaps on Instagram of the pair posing together, as she told the musician that she has 'love for [him] always'.

She also revived the racy GQ cover shot she shared with the handsome Tottenham native, which showed her posing topless while in his embrace.

Captioning the series of images, which also showed her partying with Skepta, real name Joseph Junior Adenuga, she wrote: 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY JUNIOR @skeptagram on this special day we celebrate you...

'You have never waited for things to come to you, you have always created and independently got it out there to the world .. changing the way things were done!

Back in June, the south London native left a loved-up comment underneath Skepta's latest Instagram post, days after his very flirty exchange with Adele.

The supermodel appeared to approve of the rapper sharing a snap of himself in a face mask, as she wrote underneath it 'mask' with three love heart emojis. 

Skepta, who shared a slew of different snaps, captioned the post: 'Oh ohh... I Had a dream last night and you were in'.

The supermodel was romantically linked with the Grime artist in 2018, though they never publicly confirmed their relationship.

That same month, the runway icon rubbished suggestions she was no longer on speaking terms with Skepta.

After she made comments about an acrimonious break up with her last beau, fans were quick to claim she was talking about Skepta, which she disputed. 

In an Instagram post, the Vogue cover star shared snaps of herself cosying up to the rapper, as she penned: 'STOP. All love between Us @skeptagram.'

Speaking to Times Weekend magazine, Naomi said she is on good terms with all her previous ex-boyfriends, but admitted she isn't friends with her 'last' ex. 

Discussing who she has dated, she said: 'Why don't you say it the other way round? Surely it was their privilege just as much as mine to be with them? But yes, I had some wild and exciting times until I changed my life aged 29.

'Whatever they say about me, I have remained friends with all my exes... except the last one.'

Asked if she means Skepta, she simply said: 'A lady never discusses the details of her private life.'

Romance? Fans speculated something romantic was brewing between the pair, when Skepta wrote, 'Finally got your Instagram password lol'

Naomi and Skepta were reportedly dating for around five months in 2018, with the rapper even referencing her in the song Interlude, claiming she wore sexy underwear for him during a video call.

He penned: 'How can I fall asleep when I’m on this FaceTime with Nao... shh. She got them ­Victoria Secrets that she’s tryna show me.'

In August 2018, Naomi unfollowed Skepta after he posted a baby scan on Instagram, leading fans to question whether or not they might be expecting.

She deleted any trace of him from her social media, including their raunchy GQ cover which had been released in March of that year.

Skepta has since been linked with Adele. The rapper posted a flirty comment underneath one of her Instagram posts back in June.
