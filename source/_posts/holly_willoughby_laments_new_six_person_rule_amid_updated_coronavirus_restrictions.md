Holly Willoughby has lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections.

Talking on Thursday's This Morning, the host, 39, asked whether she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, or father Terry, on Christmas due to having a family of five. 

On Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'.

Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. 

Holly has three children - Harry, 11, Belle, nine, and Chester, five, with husband Dan Baldwin meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'. 

Discussing the new restrictions with Matthew Wright on This Morning, the ITV star said: 'This is awkward for me. I'm in a family of five. Am I going to have to choose between my mum and dad on Christmas?'

To which Matthew, 55, replied: 'I'm feeling very confused and conflicted. The rules are different everywhere else in the United Kingdom.

'You can't have your parents over on Christmas Day but you can go on public transport? For the life of me, I can't make any sense of it.'

With Holly adding: 'I guess the other thought is how is anyone going to police these rules. The government are going to have marshals to monitor people.'

England will be subjected to new coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections.

Boris Johnson said groups of more than six people would be banned from meeting, in what he called a 'rule of six'.

Family-of-five: Holly has three children - Harry, 11, Belle, nine, and Chester, five, with husband Dan Baldwin meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'

Discussing the new restrictions on This Morning, the ITV star said: 'This is awkward for me. I'm in a family of five. Am I going to have to choose between my mum and dad on Christmas?'

'I wish that we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives,' he said.

'I will be absolutely clear. This is not, these measures are not, another national lockdown. The whole point is to avoid a second national lockdown,' he added.

The new rules will be enforced in England and will apply to indoor and outdoor gatherings, including homes, parks, pubs and restaurants.    

It comes amid claims that Holly is reportedly preparing for a legal battle against her old talent agency in a disagreement over money.

She added: With Holly adding: 'I guess the other thought is how is anyone going to police these rules. The government are going to have marshals to monitor people.'

The This Morning presenter is taking action against the YMU Group after they are said to be demanding a percentage of her future earnings, despite Holly forming her own agency Roxy. 

The TV star is reported to be gearing up to take legal action and has a plethora of support from her showbiz friends, with a source telling The Sun: 'She won't be taken for a fool.'

The source told the publication: 'Holly is a strong, savvy, very successful woman working in a tough industry — she won’t be taken for a fool. 

'It’s a real shame how things have turned out, as she was incredibly loyal to YMU for many years, but now they are demanding commission on future earnings. It is madness.' 

Fines: Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200 (Holly's husband Dan pictured with their three children)

The insider went on to add that after setting up her 'all-female team' Roxy, Holly is all about 'empowerment' and will not 'roll over on the matter' should the dispute go down the legal route.

MailOnline have contacted a representative of Holly and YMU for comment.   

Last month it was reported that Holly had quit the showbiz agency that she shares with This Morning co-star Phillip Schofield. 

The mum-of-three is said to have made plans to manage herself within an all-female team, after leaving the agency after 13 years.

'Rule of six': Boris Johnson said groups of more than six people would be banned from meeting, in what he called a 'rule of six' starting on Monday 

The Sun reported at the time that the star made the huge career decision after the coronavirus lockdown gave her time to reflect on her future.

The company YMU, who were previously known as James Grant, have a number of big name stars on the books including Ant and Dec, Graham Norton and Claudia Winkleman.

A source told the publication: 'Lockdown has given her time to reflect and think about her future. In many ways, it has become the perfect opportunity to start afresh and it was just time for a change.

'She is really excited about managing herself and having more say over decisions on a day-to-day basis.

'She has always had such incredible business sense and is proud to be a working mum and career woman.'

The insider went on to say that Holly's career decision was the 'logical next step' after she hoped to develop a 'better work-life balance.'
