Sunday evening saw The TOWIE 10th anniversary show air on ITVBe. 

And, small clusters of the show's stars were gathered together to be shown shown some of the most iconic moments under different categories, as voted for by fans of the show.

When it came to 'most confrontational moment,' Pete Wicks, 31, was left cringing as his brutal 2016 fight with Megan McKenna, 27, in Marbella took the top spot.  

Cringe! Pete Wicks, 31, was left cringing as his brutal 2016 fight with Megan McKenna, 27, in Marbella was named 'most confrontational moment,' during the TOWIE's 10th anniversay show

In the throwback clip, a visibly emotional Megan questioned Pete about messaging other girls behind her back, while he feigned innocence.

While watching the scene back, Pete was left with his head in his hands as he cringed over their interaction.  

'Oh my god this is killing me. Turn it off. Turn it off!' begged the long haired lothario as he watched Megan break down in tears over his disloyal actions.

'You've been telling this girl you want to be single - go and be f**king single then,' she said to him, after discovering that he had been in touch with ex-girlfriend Jacqui Ryland. 





Megan let rip at Pete in the clip as he attempted to justify his actions by claiming he hadn't cheated on her, but the feisty reality starlet shot back: 'It's worse than cheating!' 

'How do you think I feel?' she raged after they had been sat together on a sun lounger, after telling him: 'F**k off and be single then.' 

'I've been on the other end of Megan, it's not nice,' admitted Chloe Meadows as the cast watched the X Factor star unleashed her fury on Pete in the clip.  

'I've gotta take the blame for that haven't I?' admitted Pete after watching the heartbreaking scene in full.

Fuming: Megan let rip at Pete as he attempted to justify his actions by claiming he hadn't cheated on her, but the feisty reality starlet shot back: 'It's worse than cheating!'



Second place in the 'most confrontational moment,' category was taken by Lucy Mecklenburgh and her ex Mario Falcone, when he was left covered in red wine at the end of a tense argument. 

'If you wanna be a s**g...' blasted Mario after Lucy revealed she knew he'd cheated on her, before swilling him with her drink.

Looking back at the scene, the cast members were shocked by Mario's behaviour and praised Lucy for managing to not get a drop of red on herself during the confrontation.
