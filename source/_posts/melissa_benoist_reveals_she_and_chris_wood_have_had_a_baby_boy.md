Melissa Benoist posted a heartwarming Instagram picture this Friday announcing the birth of her firstborn son.

'Huxley Robert Wood got here a few weeks ago and this little boy is everything,' announced the 31-year-old actress.

She shares her baby with her dashing Supergirl co-star Chris Wood whom she married last September in Ojai, California.

She broke the news of her baby's arrival by posting a snapshot that showed her newborn's hand resting against her fingers. 

Melissa revealed she was pregnant in March, joking that her husband 'has always been an old dad by nature but now he’s going to be a real one!'

The birth announcement came just days after it emerged that her show Supergirl will be ending after its upcoming sixth season.

With filming postponed to work around the coronavirus lockdowns and the leading lady's pregnancy, the season is looking at premiering next year.

The shoot is expected to resume in Vancouver next Monday and season six will have 20 episodes, Deadline reported this week. 

Melissa reportedly agreed with the network that the Arrowverse show had run its course amid flagging ratings.

'To say it has been an honor portraying this iconic character would be a massive understatement,' she wrote on Instagram as news of the cancellation spread.

'Seeing the incredible impact the show has had on young girls around the world has always left me humbled and speechless,' she added.

'She’s had that impact on me, too. She’s taught me strength I didn’t know I had, to find hope in the darkest of places, and that we are stronger when we’re united. What she stands for pushes all of us to be better. She has changed my life for the better, and I’m forever grateful,' Melissa continued in her statement.

'I’m so excited that we get to plan our conclusion to this amazing journey, and I cannot wait for you to see what we have in store. I promise we’re going to make it one helluva final season.'

Chris proposed to Melissa in February last year, with the former Vampire Diaries actor revealing it was 'the happiest' moment of his life. 

Melissa posted a selfie of the pair showing off her dazzling engagement ring, which Chris had designed himself with Ron Meyer's daughter Jennifer.

Seven months after the engagement they married at a private estate with guests including Kevin Smith, Paul Wesley and Supergirl's Odette Annable.
