Victor Osimhen believes that Napoli is the best club for him right now even though he rejected several Premier League clubs this summer ahead of the Serie A move.

The Nigerian forward had a stellar debut season at Lille last term, scoring 18 goals in 38 matches to make him one of the most highly-rated strikers in the 2019-20 campaign.

That rich goalscoring form allowed for the 21-year-old to be linked to the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham in England's top-flight but he instead moved to Gennaro Gattuso's side for deal which could rise to £72million.

But Osimhen told CAFOnline: 'Many predicted I will move to the EPL, and I had a lot of interesting offers from some clubs. But Napoli was the best choice for me.

'It was so because of the kind of player I want to be in the future, and the kind of great career I want to have. I have no doubt that Napoli is the club I need to achieve that greater height.

'The relationship between me and the coach and President (Aurelio De Laurentiis) is a very interesting one, because even before I came to Napoli, I spoke with both. They convinced me even more to sign for Napoli. 

'The relationship is going very well, and I just want to repay them on the pitch for the trust they have in me.'

Osimhen admitted that Napoli is the perfect move as the Serie A season starts on Sunday

Before Osimhen's exciting spell at Lille, he struggled to perform at German side VfL Wolfsburg and was loaned out to Belgian club Charleroi in 2018

It was in this temporary spell where the Nigerian found some form scoring 20 goals in 36 matches in all competitions which caught the eye of Lille. 

Now he will get the chance to take on the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Romelu Lukaku for the Serie A Golden Boot award, which is a challenge the young striker is relishing.  

He added: 'I'm really looking forward to a new career here in Serie A. Playing against the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo is something one can eagerly await. So, I'm looking forward to facing him soon.'

'There is no pressure on me since I came here rather, I just need to work and do what I loved doing. I just need to do my work on the pitch and give my all like I have always been doing and getting the goals for both my club and country.

'This is the most important thing for me and there is no pressure at all. I just want to do my thing in my own way.'

Osimhen is Napoli's record signing and is one of the most exciting purchases the club has made in several years.

The 21-year-old is hoping he can have a similar effect to Diego Maradona in his Napoli spell between 1984 and 1991.

Though the forward's role model growing up was ex-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba and the new Napoli man even claims to have based his game around the former Ivory Coast goal machine.

Osimhen said: 'Choosing Drogba as a role model has really been helpful since my growing up years. I have not met him yet and I'm really looking forward to seeing him and getting one of his signed jerseys; that would really be a dream come true for me.

'Now, playing in a club that used to have Diego Maradona, who is undoubtedly one of the greatest players ever, is inspiring. 

'Maradona is an idol here in Napoli and I have seen his pictures everywhere. He is truly the best. 

'To be here and to play on the same pitch of Maradona is another dream came true.'

Osimhen will be looking to get his Serie A career off to the perfect start when Napoli visit Parma on Sunday for the opening match of the Italian top-flight.
