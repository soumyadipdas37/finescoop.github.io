Bachelor Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert will soon welcome blonde bombshell intruder Bec Cvilikas into the mansion.

The 25-year-old Sunshine Coast native's arrival appears to draw the instant wrath of her co-stars as she shares intense chemistry with Locky.

'The second Locky and I connected on the screen, there was this instant spark. You couldn't have wiped the smile off our faces if you tried!' Bec told TV Week this week.

 

New connection: Meet Locky Gilbert's post lock-down blonde bombshell intruder Bec Cvilikas, 25, (pictured), who is set to ruffle feathers on this week's The Bachelor 

 'Some of the girls are definitely taken aback by how strong our connection is in such a short time I mean, even I am!' she continued.

Bec describes herself as 'a bit of a tomboy' having played rugby for years.

'I don't know if the other girls are jealous, but if it was the other way around, I'd be feeling protective over my connection as well,' she added.

In a teaser trailer for this week's episodes, host Osher Günsberg tells the remaining ladies another woman has entered the competition via video link. 

'She's frickin amazing!' an excited Locky gushes in a piece-to-camera. 'All the boxes are being ticked.' 

But while Bachelor Locky is thrilled about the new arrival, fellow suitor Izzy Sharman-Firth describes the newcomer as a 'kick in the d**k'.   

There she is! While Bec joins the cast in an upcoming episode, she's already sneakily featured in promotional footage for the series. The blonde appears to enjoy a single date with Locky whitewater rafting, and even shares a kiss with the former Survivor star while aboard the adventure raft

Last month, Daily Mail Australia published images of Bec at a rose ceremony following hometown week, which was filmed in July. 

Five women were pictured on the grounds of the estate: Irena Srbinovska, Kaitlyn Hoppe, Bella Varelis, Izzy Sharman-Firth and Bec.
