James 'Arg' Argent will reportedly miss out on the Only Way Is Essex 10 year reunion after getting stuck in Spain following the collapse of the UK air bridge.

The reality star, 32, was caught out while holidaying in Marbella earlier this summer when the government pulled the bridge between the UK and Spain.

After learning he would need to isolate for two weeks once he returned home, Arg apparently decided to stay in Marbella to fulfil his next gig.

A source told The Sun: 'Arg was caught out because he was in Marbella for a gig when the rules changed.

'It made more sense for him to stay out there until the next gig, and he wouldn't have been able to film for Towie anyway because he'd have had to quarantine for two weeks when he got back from Spain. 

'He's really sad to miss filming as he loves the show but will be watching at home.'

Despite being sacked from the reality show over his drug addiction admission, Arg was invited back by bosses for the reunion special.

MailOnline have contacted TOWIE and Arg for further comment.

Last year, James suffered two near-fatal overdoses at his home, with his then-girlfriend Gemma calling emergency services after his family feared he was dead.

The Essex native turned his life around and is continuing his recovery after he flew to Thailand earlier this year to go to rehab for his drug and drink addiction.

Things for James haven't been as promising in the romance department as he broke up with his partner Gemma, 39, earlier this summer after she revealed a string of abusive messages, purportedly sent to her by him prior to their split.

It's understood the Jump star had made derogatory remarks abut her weight after she suggested that he had bought another woman dinner.

The self-proclaimed diva decided to take some time off social media, citing that she was 'devastated' and 'heartbroken' by the exchange.

However after returning to the UK from her own Tenerife getaway, Gemma apologised to her former beau for releasing the messages.
