A teenager has been found guilty of stabbing to death an Aston Villa youth player after a row erupted when his friend 'tried it on' with the footballer's girlfriend at a house party.

Sukhbir Singh-Phull, 18, plunged a blade into the chest of Premier League starlet Ramani Morgan, 16, after a row broke out in the street on February 29.

A court heard the pair clashed after Phull's friend had 'tried it on' with Ramani's girlfriend at the party in Coventry.

Ramani was rushed to hospital with multiple stab wounds after being brutally attacked but was pronounced dead just before midnight.

Phull and a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went on trial accused of murder at Warwick Crown Court.

Today, Phull was found guilty of murder and faces life in prison while the youth was cleared of the same charge by a jury.

Phull, of Binley Road, Coventry, will be sentenced at a later date.

The trial had heard how a fight broke out between Phull and Ramani after his co-defendant had started flirting with the victim's girlfriend.

He had also earlier turned down an alcoholic drink made by his alleged killers over fears it may have been spiked.

The girl hosting the house party later kicked everyone out as she was afraid the property was going to get 'trashed'.

At that point, Phull whispered something in Ramani's ear and told him to 'step outside' where a fight then broke out in the street.

The teenager was stabbed four times - including through the cheek and once in the chest - before he collapsed in a pool of blood after trying to run away.

Ramani, who played for the youth teams of Villa and Walsall, could not be saved despite an air ambulance doctor briefly managing to revive him at the scene.

When the teenagers were arrested the next day, officers found the North Face jacket Phull was wearing, with Ramani's blood on it, at the 17-year-old's home.

He answered 'no comment' in police interviews before eventually being charged with murder.

Ramani's family said in a statement after the verdict: 'No sentence will ever be enough and nothing can bring Ramani back or ease our pain.

'We do not want something like this to happen to another family. A clear message needs to be sent out so no other family should go through what we have gone through.'

The family previously said in a tribute: 'Ramani was so kind, caring, and humble and had a beautiful soul.

'He had the potential of becoming a professional footballer. Ramani had many hopes and dreams and he had his whole life ahead of him.

'Ramani was the best son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin anyone could ever wish for. Ramani was loved by everyone that knew him.'
