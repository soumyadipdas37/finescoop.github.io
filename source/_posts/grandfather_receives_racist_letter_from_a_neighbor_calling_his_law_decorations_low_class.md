People are offering to buy a grandfather who loves to decorate his home more lawn decorations after a neighbor anonymously sent him a cruel, racist letter saying his front lawn is an 'embarrassment' and looks like a 'low-class Mexican family' lives there. 

Twitter user @goIdenstef shared her outrage while posting a photo of the vitriolic letter that was sent to her grandfather and signed 'the decent, middle-class people with Class of Thunderbird Hills sub-division.'

'Someone REALLY sent this to my grandpa...... my man is just trynna decorate his house and....... I f*****g hate people,' she wrote, and the tweet quickly went viral. 

Heartbreaking: A grandfather's cheerful lawn decorations were called 'low class' and an 'embarrassment' in a  racist letter written by an anonymous neighbor 

Outrage: Twitter user @goIdenstef shared a photo of the vitriolic letter that was sent to her grandfather and signed 'the decent, middle-class people with Class'

The letter, which was written on a typewriter, included insults and racial slurs as well as a number of grammatical errors.

'My wife and I exercise every so oftenby [sic] walking around the neighborhood, but each time we walk in front of your house we've noticed that you have put up yet another new decoration or ornament in front of your house,' the cowardly neighbor wrote. 

'Oh my God - Enough already. All the people that we know in our neighborhood have commented on the EXCESSIVE decorations in front of your house - and am sorry to say, your house has become, and is, the laughing joke of the neighborhood. 

'Some of our friends have even purposefully driven in front of your house just to see how RIDICULOUS all of those decorations look like - and needless to say, they all laugh. All those decorations are in "bad taste" and only goes to prove to everyone that a "low class Mexican family" lives there, or some Gypsy family [sic].'



















Disgusted: Many commenters were stunned that someone would write such an unnecessarily harsh and openly racist letter over a neighbor's lawn decorations

The person went onto insult everything from the grandfather's potted plants to the number of American flags that were on his lawn.  

'If the decorations were not bad enough, you all then started planting "pot plants" in the middle of the lawn. Oh my God, where do you people come from?' the neighbor cruelly asked. 'It makes me absolutely no sense to have "plants" in the middle of the lawn. 

'Also, do you realize that you have four or five American flags displayed in your front. Hello? Do you think that's going to make people think you're patriotic? Believe me, they will think like we do - at how Ridiculous that looks [sic].'

The person insisted that the homeowner must have moved to the neighborhood from some other part of town, without knowing anything about him. 

'Apparently you people must have come here to our neighborhood from the deep West side or the deep South side where all the poor people with no class live,' the neighbor wrote. 'Believe me when I tell you that your house is an EMBARRASSMENT to the neighborhood. 

Proof: The Twitter user later shared photos of her grandfather's home

Too cute: The man's yard is decorated with plants and American flags 

'THAT'S IT?' People were even angrier to learn there is nothing at all 'excessive' about his decorations

'Do us a favor - start looking at the other houses around here and then take a look at your house - and then come to realize how ridiculous and embarrassing your excessive house decorations look to the rest of us.'

'Sincerely, the decent, middle-class people with Class of Thunderbird Hills sub-division.' 

Many commenters were stunned that someone would write such an unnecessarily harsh and openly racist letter over a neighbor's lawn decorations. 

'The typewriter is to add ~aestheticism~ to the racism vomiting out of this letter,' one person commented, while another added: 'The way this reeks of racism.'   

'I KNOW LIKE [crying emoji],' @goIdenstef replied. 'I feel so bad bc my grandpa loves decorating his house.'

Her post has been retweeted nearly 30,000 times and has gotten more than 11,000 quote tweets. 



















Encouragement: People even offered to send the grandfather more decorations to fill his lawn.

The Twitter user later shared photos of her grandfather's home, and people were even angrier to learn that the house is beautiful and there is nothing at all 'excessive' about his decorations. 

'This makes me want to cry. The f*****g audacity of people. This house is adorable and exactly the kind of house I get excited about when I pass in front,' one person wrote. 

'The house is sooo beautiful. Imagine [your] life being so empty and meaningless that your concern is that someone's lawn is as boring and lifeless as yours,' another agreed. 

People even offered to send the grandfather more decorations to fill his lawn.

'What? That’s it? THAT'S IT? I read the letter I was picturing every inch of that lawn being covered. THEY WROTE THAT LETTER FOR THIS? THAT IT??? I am gunna send so many decorations we will cover every inch of that lawn!!' one Twitter user wrote. 

'His yard is cute! I love the variety and that is how the inside of my house is. Those people must have nothing of meaning or value since they don’t display anything. Set up a PO Box I’d love to send your grandpa some more decorations!' someone else shared.
