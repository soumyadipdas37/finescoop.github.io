It wouldn't be Kieth's first time on a panel of a reality TV singing contest. 

Keith featured as a couch on the inaugural season of The Voice Australia in 2012, before quitting due to a conflict in scheduling.

In a statement issued by the Nine Network in September 2012, Urban said: 'I've been so fortunate to have been a part of The Voice. And as much as I'd love to do it again, it's clear that the recording and promoting of a new album, a tour and other commitments will keep me from being a part of the second season.'

However, two days later he was confirmed as a new judge on American Idol. He remained on the program for four years.

Nicole has recently been filming $100M production of miniseries Nine Perfect Strangers in New South Wales' coastal town of Byron Bay.  

She told The Daily Telegraph in July that she was 'thrilled' to be able to bring hundreds of jobs to the local industry. 

'It is a great opportunity for me to give back to the community that nurtured me through so much of my career,' Nicole said.
