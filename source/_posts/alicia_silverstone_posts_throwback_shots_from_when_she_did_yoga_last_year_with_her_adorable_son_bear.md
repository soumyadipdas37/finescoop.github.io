She recently marked the astounding 25th anniversary since her iconic film Clueless was released. 

And Alicia Silverstone continued to reminisce on Instagram on Thursday, with a throwback post to a much more recent memory – when she did yoga with her adorable son Bear Blu, now nine, last year. 

The Crush star, 43, looked blissful in the throwback shots, sitting in a butterfly pose as her long-haired son sat in front of her.

Alicia's hair hung loose in the snaps, blending in with Bear's coif which was partially up.

She wore a black leotard and leggings, while her little boy was in a black graphic t-shirt and red shorts. 

They appeared to be sitting on the floor of a bedroom, on a circular ombre rug decorated with a crescent moon. 

In one sweet image, Bear turned his head as his mom leaned in to give him a kiss.

The little kid had his hands in prayer position, typical of a yoga class.

'It's not often that I get to do yoga... let alone have my son join me! He isn't a big fan of yoga, but sometimes he gets into it, and when he does it's the sweetest thing!' Silverstone captioned the post, along with some yogi emojis. 

'These photos are from last year, but they’re too cute not to share. #tbt' she concluded.

The trio beamed from a swimming pool in the summer snap, which Alicia captioned: 'Perfect day for a pool day!' 

Silverstone and Jarecki were married from 2005 until 2018, but appear to remain more than amicable co-parents, judging from the recent post.

That share comes during a summer in which the notorious vegan is celebrating 25 years since the release of Clueless, the teen comedy directed by Amy Heckerling that launched Silverstone's career.

She's posted stills from the film, which came out on July 19th, 1995, as well as video snippets.

Just last week, Alicia spoke with Vogue about the wealth of fashion from the film, including the beguiling skirt and jacket set she wore in the opening scene.

'Still have no idea where that iconic yellow plaid outfit is...' she wrote, in part, in the caption.
