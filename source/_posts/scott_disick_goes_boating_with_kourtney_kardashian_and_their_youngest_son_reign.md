Scott Disick has become quite the family man since splitting from his girlfriend of three-years Sofia Richie, 22, in May.

And the 37-year-old Talentless founder enjoyed a fun-filled boat ride with ex Kourtney Kardashian, 41, and their youngest son Reign, five, on Sunday afternoon.

Scott and Kourtney appeared to be cruising around the gorgeous Lake Coeur d'Alene in Idaho, where pals Justin Bieber and wife Hailey also happen to be staying this weekend.

Scott documented the entire day out on the lake on his Instagram Story, first with a portrait of himself manning the motorboat as Kourtney and Reign relaxed.

Scott had on a vibrant floral shirt and swim trunks, while Kourtney put her curves on display in a neon pink two piece suit and a coverup.

Reign, rocking his newly shaved head, had on a white tank top, a pair of aqua blue swim trunks, and a life vest as he clung onto his mom. 

He followed up the family shot with one that showed his 'baby driver' Reign holding onto the steering wheel as he sat in Scott's lap.

To show off the awesome boat they have been using throughout their getaway, Disick uploaded a wide shot of him and some of his closest pals hanging out on the water.

Kourtney also shared snapshots from the outing to her personal Instagram Story, but most were to show off her sensational swimwear.

'say hi to Ruby,' wrote the POOSH founder who posed with her new Poodle puppy as she set on the edge of her family's rental boat.

Kardashian's darling dog Ruby looked more than content in the former reality star's grasp.

Due to the sweetness of Kourtney's dog Ruby's face, Scott could not help but share a candid snapshot of her on his Instagram Story. 

And, based on his caption, he nicknamed the new addition to the Kardashian clan 'Rube.'

Although they were not pictured at Sunday's outing, Scott and Kourtney also share son Mason, 10, and daughter Penelope, eight.

The former couple split in 2015 after nine-years together, but have remained close friends and expert co-parents.

Scott, Kourtney, and their three children spent a large majority of the summer at an oceanside rental property in Malibu, where they were often seen hanging out on their deck or playing on the beach.

Despite spending so much time together over the past few months, sources close to Scott and Kourtney recently told TMZ that 'they're not a couple.'

Meanwhile, Scott's ex girlfriend Sofia Richie was spotted enjoying an affectionate beach date with her longtime pal and former flame Jaden Smith, 22, on Saturday.

The pair, who reportedly dated in 2012 when they were just 14, romped around in the water, held hands, and even enjoyed a lovingly embrace on the sand.

In the evening, Sofia and Jaden enjoyed an intimate dinner with a few of their closest pals at Nobu in Malibu.  

Sofia and Scott ended their three-year relationship in May, following his brief stint at a Colorado rehab facility.

Two-months after their breakup, the pair reunited at a Fourth Of July party in Malibu. 

But by mid-August, numerous outlets reported that Scott and Sofia decided to end their relationship for good.
