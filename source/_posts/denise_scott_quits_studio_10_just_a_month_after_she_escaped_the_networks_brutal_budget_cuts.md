Australian comedienne Denise Scott has announced she has quit Studio 10.

On Monday's episode of Have You Been Paying Attention?, the 65-year-old said: 'I'm no longer the correspondent. I've been in lockdown since March, and I just simply ran out of things to correspond about!'

This comes just a month after Channel 10 confirmed Denise would be staying on at the morning talk show as a Melbourne-based contributor amidst their brutal budget cuts which saw 25 employees axed from their positions.

Last month it was revealed that Studio 10's Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling were made redundant from their positions. 

On Saturday, the network confirmed that professional dancer Tristan MacManus would be joining journalist Sarah Harris as the new hosts of the show.  

Tristan and Sarah will be joined by news reporter Narelda Jacobs, entertainment reporter Angela Bishop, and contributors Denise Drysdale, Jono Coleman and Craig Bennett.

Channel 10 had confirmed that Denise would also be remaining as a regular contributor on the show.

Denise initially quit the show as a full-time panellist in July 2019, due to the constant travel between Channel 10's Sydney studios and her Melbourne home.

The program went on to create a role for her as their Melbourne correspondent.

However, it appears the lack of work during the COVID-19 pandemic has forced her to part ways from the network.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted a Channel 10 representative for further comment. 

During their budget cuts, Channel 10 also revealed that Joe Hildebrand's role on Studio 10 was still being discussed. 

Last week, Hildebrand revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show that he been offered 'a new role' and is in talks with the network about 'what that might be'.
