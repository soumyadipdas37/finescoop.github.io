She received harsh criticism following her debut as the new host of Dancing With the Stars earlier this week. 

But Tyra Banks seemed unbothered as she enjoyed downtime on Friday with her beau Louis Belanger-Martin.

The former America's Next Top Model host wore blue capri sweats, with a zip-up grey sweatshirt and colorful flip-flop sandals. 

Tyra tucked her golden curled hair under a retro looking silk scarf that she tied around her head, with the ends flowing out from underneath.  

She was sure to follow safety precautions amid the pandemic as she donned a black face mask.

Meanwhile her businessman beau opted for an all black outfit that was equally as casual. 

Louis wore a black long-sleeve tee, and he scrunched the sleeves up to his elbows. 

He teamed it with black sweats, slide on sandals and a white medical facemask. 

The couple sparked engagement rumors back in August when they were seen out and Tyra had a large diamond ring on her left ring finger.

The outing comes after Tyra bravely made her debut as host of Dancing With The Stars on Monday evening during the show's season 29 premiere.

And fans of the long-running celebrity competition series took to Twitter to ruthlessly BLAST the 46-year-old supermodel's performance.

A majority of the tweets desperately begged for the return of veteran hosts Tom Bergeron, 65, and Erin Andrews, 42, who were shockingly canned in July.

Bergeron had been with the Dancing With The Stars franchise since it launched in 2005, while his former co-host Andrews joined the show in 2014.

In an interview with Extra earlier this month, Andrews revealed that her and Tom's unexpected dismissals from Dancing With The Stars 'was a surprise' and that hers came via phone call.

Though there was never a direct reason given as to why the pair were axed, Valerie Bruce, general manager of LA Productions, stated that Dancing With The Stars was being taken 'in a new creative direction' for season 29.

She also offered her, 'sincere thanks to Tom and Erin, whom we will always consider part of the Dancing with the Stars' family.'
