White Claw's Hard Seltzer, arguably one of America's most talked about beverages, is going to be released on preorder in Australia from October 5. 

Lion Australia secured the rights to import and distribute the low-calorie alcoholic drink in May, striking a lucrative deal with its maker Mark Anthony Brands International.

And now Dan Murphy's is offering thirsty customers the opportunity to get their hands on the popular drink from Monday next week.

'White Claw is without a doubt 2020's most anticipated drink. We've seen a 798 percent increase for White Claw searches on the Dan Murphy website in the last two weeks,' Dan Murphy's Premix Category Manager Andrew McCrae said.

The preorder opens on Monday October 5 at 9am AEST and will guarantee customers will be able to get their claws on the seltzers - either through contactless delivery or pick-up - from Monday October 12, when the range will be available in stores.

Dan Murphy's is the first retailer in Australia to offer pre-orders of White Claw Hard Seltzer.

'Since we increased our range in September, we've seen more Australians getting curious about seltzers. In the last three weeks, we've seen seltzer sales grow by almost 100 percent,' McCrae said. 

The drink is made with sparkling water, triple-distilled spirit and a hint of fruit flavour, with Australians initially able to choose between mango, natural lime and ruby grapefruit.

With only 95 calories per can, it's also gluten free, has an alcohol by volume percentage of 4.5 per cent and contains no artificial sweeteners

It can be purchased in a four-pack of 330ml cans for $23.90, and delivery is free when you preorder. 

Dan Murphy's will beat the price if a competitor retails White Claw Hard Seltzer for less than their own on launch day, and will refund the difference to customers who have preordered.

The beverage has taken the US by storm since its 2016 launch and attracted a cult following for its popular perception as a 'healthy alcohol' drink with less calories and sugar, which sparked nationwide shortages.    

White Claw dominates the US seltzer category with three fifths of the $2.5 billion market, almost triple the size of its nearest competitor

'The popularity of White Claw cannot be disputed,' Lion Australia managing director James Brindley said in a statement in May.

'Despite the fact the product has not actually been available in Australia up until now, it has well and truly earned its place in popular culture and is the market leader globally in this exciting new category. 

'It is the most sought-after beverage brand in the world right now.'

The partnership expands Lion's presence in the alcohol market as the maker of popular beers such as XXXX Gold, Tooheys Hahn, James Boag, James Squire and Little Creatures. 

You can preorder White Claw's Hard Seltzer from this website link on October 5.
