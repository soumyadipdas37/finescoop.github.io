Jessica Rowe has dared to bare all in a powerful social media post. 

On Tuesday, the media personality shared a series of photographs to Instagram that showed her getting a mammogram. 

The 50-year-old explained that it was her first time getting the test as she encouraged women to continue to get their health check ups throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accompanying the powerful message were two pictures of the mum-of-two in a blue medical robe undergoing the mammogram.

A mammogram takes an x-ray of breast tissue to check for breast cancer and other changes. 

According to the Cancer Council, women aged 50-74 are encouraged to have a mammogram every two years.  

Jessica became an ambassador for Sydney Breast Cancer Foundation earlier this year, and she has been the host of their fundraiser, Ladies Lunch, since 2016.
