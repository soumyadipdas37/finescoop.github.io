Wolves have secured the signing of Ki-Jana Hoever from Liverpool, their fifth deal of the summer transfer window.  

The Dutch centre-back made two appearances in the FA Cup for the Reds' first-team but never appeared in the Premier League, instead impressing for their under-23 side. 

Wolves have already made a record signing this summer with Fabio Silva moving from Porto for £36m, also loaning Vitinha from the Portuguese club and bringing in Lyon's Marcal for £1.8m.
