She the American heiress and socialite who is making headlines around the world thanks to her revealing new documentary, This Is Paris.

And now Paris Hilton has shocked fans once again, after she debuted her REAL voice during a live TV interview. 

The 39-year-old, who is known for her 'baby voice,' appeared on Sunrise on Monday and spoke with a deeper tone, insisting that she's just been 'playing a dumb blonde' over the years.   

'I've been playing a character': Paris Hilton shocked fans this week as she debuted her REAL voice during a live TV interview with Seven's Sunrise (pictured)

'This entire time, I have been playing a character, so the world has never truly known who I am,' Paris began. 

'The real me is someone who is actually brilliant. I'm not a dumb blonde, I'm just really good at pretending to be one.'

She added: 'I don't want to be remembered for some airhead, but the businesswoman I am.'

Paris has been promoting her revealing new documentary by doing plenty of press. 

Some fans commented on her voice from recent interviews, saying it's a 'serve' and quite 'deep.' 

'Paris Hilton talking in her real voice and not her baby voice is SUCH a f**king SERVE!' one fan tweeted. 

Another added: 'Paris Hilton's real voice is deep.'

Meanwhile one said that they were 'shook' to hear her real voice. 

'So Paris Hilton FAKED her voice?? I'm shook but I just heard her real voice and it's rlly (sic) nice.'

Over on the Today show, Paris elaborated on her achievements in business.

The former socialite also explained that her YouTube documentary, This Is Paris, was initially intended to be about her life now as a businesswoman.

However, she revealed that she became close friends with the documentary's director Alexandra Dean and began speaking about the physical and mental abuse she faced as a teenager at a boarding school in Utah.

'There are families that have approached me who have pulled their children out of that school that I was at because they saw the trailer to my film,' she said.

'It's exciting that this is making a difference and going to help save children's lives.' 

Revealing: This Is Paris was initially intended to be about her life now as a businesswoman. However, she speaks about the physical and mental abuse she faced as a teenager at a boarding school in Utah

Paris' wealthy parents, Kathy and Richard, sent her to many boarding schools following a rebellious phase after living at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City.

Paris spent 11 months at Provo Canyon School, the last in a series of institutions which focuses on behavioural and mental development.

Between 2011 and 2014, police responded to 56 calls for assault at Provo and 25 for sexual offences.

In a statement to People, the boarding school said: 'Originally opened in 1971, Provo Canyon School was sold by its previous ownership in August 2000. 

Abuse: Elsewhere in the documentary, the heiress opened up about enduring 'multiple abusive relationships' in her life. Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, who were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change

'We therefore cannot comment on the operations or patient experience prior to this time.' MailOnline has contacted Provo Canyon School for further comment.

Elsewhere in the documentary, the heiress opened up about enduring 'multiple abusive relationships' in her life.

Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, who were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change.

Nowadays, Paris is in a 'safe' and healthy relationship with entrepreneur Carter Reum, whom she has been dating for nine months.

This Is Paris is set for release on YouTube on Monday, September 14
