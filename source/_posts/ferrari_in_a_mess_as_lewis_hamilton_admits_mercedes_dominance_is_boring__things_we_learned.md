Another weekend, another race win for Lewis Hamilton.  

Mercedes' dominance over the rest of the grid showed no signs of being under threat for the 44 laps at Spa as the six-time world champion coasted beyond the chequered flag to take his career total to 89 race wins. 

For the season he is up to five wins from the opening seven races.

But aside from Hamilton's procession from pole to the race win, Spa threw up a handful of other intriguing sub-plots. 

Ferrari's catastrophic season continues to go from bad to worse with both drivers finishing outside the points, Renault finally show signs of life at the top end while George Russell had halo to thank during his nasty race incident with Alfa Romeo's Antonio Giovinazzi at Les Fagne chicane. 

Sportsmail looks at seven things we learned from Sunday's race.  



When the sport's most marketable asset says his own race win would have 'sent him to sleep' if he was watching as a fan, alarm bells should be ringing for F1's bosses. 

Hamilton's fifth win from seven races is turning this season into a one-man show which is devoid of any real drama or entertainment. 

'I cannot speak for the fans now, but having been a fan in the (Michael) Schumacher era, I know what it is like,' Hamilton said. 

'I was a teenager then. I would have woken up, had my bacon sarnie, watched the start, gone to sleep and then woken up to watch the end. If I were watching today, I would do the same and just tune into the highlights.'

Fans know that barring any freak accidents or mechanical failures, Mercedes will assume first and second on the grid every weekend. 

Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who himself said he found no enjoyment in Sunday's race, is becoming a predictable third man on the podium. 

If the remainder of the season plays out as it has so far, expect race ratings to tumble and highlight packages to become much more popular. Something has got to give to try and rid the boredom even Hamilton can no longer ignore.  

As Giovinazzi lost control of his Alfa Romeo at the exit of Les Fagnes, an approaching Russell had little time to react. 

Giovinazzi spun and collided with the barriers to the right before one of his wheels came off and barrelled towards the Brit in the Williams. 

The 22lb wheel was picking up speed and Russell did all he could to avoid a particularly nasty incident, swerving off into the barriers to his left. 

The loose wheel did clip the front right of Russell's car but the main thing was he was able to climb out of the car unscathed, if not shaken up by the whole ordeal. 

George Russell had to act fast to swerve away from a wheel that had come off the car of rival Antonio Giovinazzi at the exit of Les Fagnes at the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday afternoon

The Williams driver admitted he was grateful he had halo technology to protect the cockpit

But for the 22-year-old, the importance of halo above the cockpit only came into greater focus. 

'If I went to the right, that's where Antonio's car was, and at the left side of the track, I had a massive impact with the tyre,' Russell said afterwards.

'But I have to say you feel much safer in the car now with the halo. 

'When I saw this massive tyre coming towards me, it was quite scary to be honest. So I'm very thankful that we have this halo on the car right now.'

It's been a tough few seasons in the Renault garage but smiles were in order as they packed up to leave Spa at the weekend. 

Daniel Ricciardo and Esteban Ocon both finished inside the top five and Ricciardo secured the team's first fastest lap since 2010 on his final run to cap off what was a thoroughly productive day for the French team. 

If things improve further - and a podium is gleamed for Ricciardo - expect a pre-season bet to come back to haunt team boss Cyril Abiteboul.

Renault are starting to find their speed on the track and they are putting their rivals on notice 

Ricciardo and Abiteboul agreed to get matching tattoos if the Australian finishes on the podium before he leaves for McLaren at the end of the season. 

Next up is Monza and it is a track that Renault have had some success on, even as recent as last year. 

Ricciardo finished fourth a year ago while his then team-mate Nico Hulkenberg came fifth. There will be an intake of breath if Ricciardo can go one better and get his boss under the ink. 

But for now they deserve credit for their showing in Spa.  

The team's points haul of 23 was the biggest single race score they have recorded since returning to the sport as a full-time manufacturer in 2016. Now the job is to prove this is a building block rather than one-and-done.

Team principal Mattia Binotto refuses to acknowledge the crisis engulfing Ferrari but accepts the Italian team are 'in the middle of a storm'. 

Neither driver made it into the final round of qualifying and come race day neither managed to finish in the points positions. 

It was one of the worst Ferrari performances from both drivers in the last decade. The decline of the great team is staggering to see. 

So bad was Spa there have been renewed calls for infrastructure changes. There is a growing sense something drastic needs to happen to breathe new life into this once great race team. 

Ferrari's worst result in a decade shows they can still plunge to even greater lows on track

'Although the team is in the middle of the storm, we are very united,' Binotto said, a bid to try and alleviate some of the scrutiny. 'There is no crisis, no tension.

'[Instead] there is bitterness and frustration in each of us. But I believe that this frustration must be transformed into reaction and determination.'

Next up is their home race in Monza and they should feel grateful that fans are not able to witness their horror show in person. 

The end of this season cannot come soon enough for Binotto and Co.  

'I'm trying everything I can,' Valtteri Bottas said after yet another runners-up finish. 

He carried on, insisting the title fight is not over, there are still 10 races to go, and the like, but it is clear to any F1 fan that the Finn simply operates in a league below his team-mate. 

When Bottas won the first race of the rearranged season in Austria, there was hope, however faint, that he could go on and deliver fans a real battle for the title in the mould of Nico Rosberg and Hamilton back in 2016.

Unfortunately what was transpired since then is Hamilton won five of the next six, Verstappen got the other one, and Bottas has had to accept a role in the supporting cast. 

His results since winning in Austria read: second, third, 11th, third, third, second. 

Mercedes are streets ahead of the rest of the field but there will be no repeat of the internal struggle for the title the team balanced four years ago.  

Sunday's race was difficult for everyone but few will say they had it tougher than AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly. 

A year on from the death of Formula 2 driver Anthoine Hubert, Gasly, who was best friends with the young Frenchman, drove exceptionally amid the emotion to prove he can still hold his own. 

Having been ditched as Verstappen's No 2 at Red Bull last season, there were plenty of question marks around Gasly and whether he really had what it takes to be a top-tier driver. 

Gasly finished eighth and dedicated it to his late friend. 

'The car was great, I felt good, I pushed as hard as I could,' he said. 'Personally, it was an important race for me, especially with what happened to Anthoine and today I’m really happy to get these points for him.'

Victory took Hamilton to 89 career wins, two shy of Schumacher, and the record-equalling seventh world championship also appears to be a formality for the Brit. 

Hamilton has already broken Schumacher's podium record having taken his 156th at the Spanish Grand Prix earlier in the month. 

More records will tumble in a season where Hamilton is so utterly dominant. 

He is one more points finish away from equalling Schumacher's record of 221 and there will be much more rewriting of the record books by the time this unforgettable season is out.
