 Good news. This is shaping up to be a busy season accessories wise, and accessories are, as everyone knows, the simplest, easiest and cheapest way to update your wardrobe.

Chunky gold chains and lockets, tick. Gold and pearl hoop earrings, tick. 'Heritage' silk scarves worn around your throat, tick.

All of the above will kick your look into next year and beyond. But the detail that looks like it will pull it all together (literally) is belts.

Yes, belts. Remember them? Sort of loved them and then . . . consigned to the drawer with the never-worn leather gloves and fussy evening bags. We haven't been wearing belt-friendly clothes for a while.

Belter: Kaia Gerber in Chloe - a belt may be your secret weapon this autumn says Shane Watson

In our sporty, smart-casual lockdown lives, belts have seemed superfluous, not to mention restricting.

But, strangely enough, a belt might turn out to be your secret weapon this autumn. It doesn't have to be wide with a slim, square buckle (though it could be), it might be a sliver of chain, or clunky and gold, or a classic, mid-width, black leather belt with a brass buckle. Just keep an open mind for now.

Wear a print dress with a sliver of gold chain.

Belts with link buckles update trousers.

CINCH in a chunky cardigan with a thick belt.

Get back to brass buckles with jeans.

The very autumn 2020 way to go is to wear a thick belt cinching in your fat woollen cardigan or tailored jacket.

This one, needless to say, requires a slim frame. We're not suggesting it's a great idea for everyone, but it's an example of what belts are meant to be doing: turning cardies into something less dozy weekend and more ripe for nipping to work, while also giving jackets a reboot (see Gigi Hadid in plaid, far right).

If you're interested, Zara does a good wide black belt (£17.99, zara.com). But more likely you're going to be wearing a regular leather belt, with an oval metal buckle (£15.99, zara.com) with your new wider-leg jeans and a tucked-in, or half tucked-in, shirt.

Or you're going to be wearing a high-waisted plaid skirt and a skinny polo neck, finished off with a narrow crocodile belt (£35, stories.com).

Or maybe a black waistcoat, a white blouse and high-waisted black trousers with a belt revealing a chunk of four solid chain links in the front (£15.99, zara.com). Here's the real point of belts and why we need to pay attention: you can see them now because your sweater is cropped, your top is partly or fully tucked in and your waistband is high up on your waist.

It's about a subtle change in silhouette, a waist-advertising shift, as well as being in the mood for a bit of bling.

These belts are also smartening, of course. If fashion has its way, you'll be wearing your wider trousers with a bold belt, a ruffle-fronted blouse, a blazer and, as previously advertised, gold and pearl earrings.

Think French sophisticate circa-1979 meets sharp Sloane Ranger. If you regret never getting around to buying one of those Gucci double G buckled belts, now is your moment (£250, matchesfashion.com).

After a similar effect for a lot less money? Try John Lewis's double O-ring belt (£26, johnlewis.com).

Last but not least, belts are old favourite restorers. Slinky chain belts like Zara's double link one with lobster clasp (£17.99, zara.com) give old separates a new contemporary edge. A gold belt with a chain (£19.99, zara.com) will transform winter's silky shirt dress.

Celine Dion poses in New York City. She wears a thin belt over a plaid co-ord

Last year's black jumpsuit? Try it this year with Massimo Dutti's double bit belt (£49.95, massimodutti.com).

Tailoring, from culottes to masculine trouser-suits, looks sharper with a belt. Try a vintage-style brown leather belt with a D brass buckle (£24.90, uniqlo.com) with one of H&M's trouser-suits, designed with Italian tailoring label Giuliva Heritage.

Everything is instantly less utility with a belt. How do you make your jeans look modern? Add a horsebit buckle belt (£34.95, massimodutti.com) or one in snake if you prefer (£10, accessorize.com). How do you make last year's midi-dress look like this autumn's It-dress? Sling on a metallic belt (£15.99, zara.com).

You can't go far wrong.
