Iggy Azalea has collaborated with many different artists over her career.

But on Friday, she managed to surprise even her most loyal fans by posing for a photo with teenage superstar JoJo Siwa.

In a photo shared to Twitter, Iggy and R&B singer Tinashe are all smiles as they pose between a grinning JoJo.

The image was taken inside the mansion where the 17-year-old films many of her YouTube and TikTok videos.

Interestingly enough, Iggy and Tinashe weren't the only celebrities in JoJo's house over the last few days.

On Friday, 90 Day Fiancé star Angela Deem also shared a photo of herself inside the young mogul's house.

Iggy and Tinashe recently teamed up for a song together, Dance Like Nobody's Watching.

In the music video for the track, the 30-year-old Australian rapper slipped into a baby blue corset top and princess-perfect pink tulle midi-skirt.

As she posed up a storm in a tattoo-inspired shirt with her blonde locks sticking up like feathers on the back of her head, Tinashe coordinated in a lime green fairytale-inspired minidress.

'Dance all night, don't my a** look right?' the Fancy songstress sang, as the video began with a photo shoot of her and Tinashe. 'Can't pass on a chance, raise your hands up like [you're] a superstar.'

As they danced around and whispered in each other's ears, the performers put their sensational figures on full display and were filmed getting ready behind-the-scenes.

The music video is the first that Iggy has released since welcoming her son Onyx earlier this year.
