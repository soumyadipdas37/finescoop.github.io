Former Bay City Rollers band member Ian Mitchell has died, at the age of 62.

Ian joined the band in 1976, aged 17, replacing bassist Alan Longmuir - but left after seven months with the Scots group, dubbed as 'tartan teen sensations'.

The official Bay City Rollers Facebook page released a statement announcing his death this morning.

It said: 'We are deeply saddened by the news of Ian Mitchell's death. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Wendy, their family and friends. Rest In Peace, Ian.'

Ian from Northern Ireland, was the first person to join the band from outside of their hometown of Edinburgh.

While with the Bay City Rollers Ian recorded one album, Dedication, in 1976, and had a hit cover of the Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want to be With You.'

The track reached number 12 on the US charts.

He left in late 1976 as the band's popularity began to dwindle and was replaced by guitarist Pat McGlynn.

Fans have today paid tribute to the singer on social media.

One wrote: 'My deepest condolences. I met Ian at Foxwoods casino in Connecticut he was doing a concert with Leif Garrett, I met his wife too.

'Both of them were very nice and sweet. Praying.'

Another said: 'I am so sorry to hear of Ian's passing. I've loved this band since I was just 4 years old, and I remember how thrilled I was to watch them on tv and to dance to their music.

'It's one of my earliest memories Thank you for the music. RIP.'
