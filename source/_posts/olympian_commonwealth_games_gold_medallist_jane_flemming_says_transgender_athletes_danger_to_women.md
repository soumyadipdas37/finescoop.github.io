Olympian and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Jane Flemming has declared transgender athletes should be banned from competing in female sport on safety grounds.

The 55-year-old retired track and field champion has weighed into the divisive issue as several sporting codes, including rugby, face calls to restrict female sport to competitors born as girls.  

The federal Sex Discrimination Act however bans gender or gender identity-based discrimination.

Flemming, who represented Australia at three Commonwealth and two Olympic games during the late 1980s and early 1990s, said transgender athletes were a safety risk to female competitors.

'The difficulty is that for the human species that's been born biological male, if they go through puberty in particular, they have, absolutely, have some physiological advantages,' she told the ABC's 7.30 program.

'Whether it is bone strength or extra capillarisation or larger muscle bulk, but then there are other aspects of that as well, not only does that affect performance but there is a health or a danger aspect.'

The issue of transgender athletes is so politically toxic Tasmanian Liberal senator Claire Chandler was labelled as 'transphobic' after calling for transgender rugby players to be banned to 'protect women's safety'.

Labor senator Nita Green likened Senator Chandler to Harry Potter author JK Rowling, who has angered trans activists by suggesting only someone born biologically female could understand what it was like to be a woman.

'Senator Chandler has made at least two speeches... trying to veil her transphobic views as faux-feminist values,' she told the Senate in late August. 

'We know where Senator Chandler's getting her speeches from because she said in a speech to the senate "I stand with JK Rowling and millions of women around the world who are determined to ensure our rights as women are not traded off in the name of diversity".'

Senator Chandler has previously told Daily Mail Australia that Rugby Australia needed to 'look at the research that's within the report, adopt the findings and prioritise women's rugby being for women'.

'Women's sport was invented for people of the female sex and any suggestion that it is somewhat provocative or controversial to articulate this view I think is pretty ludicrous,' she said.

Under World Rugby rules, which echo Olympic guidelines, trans women can play in the women's game if they take drugs to lower their testosterone for at least 12 months.

Rugby Australia is facing growing calls to ban transgender women from the female game after scientists found it was potentially unsafe for them to play.

In 2018 Australian women's handball player Hannah Mouncey, a trans woman who is 1.88metres tall and weighs 100kg, withdrew her nomination from the draft for the Australian Football League's professional women's competition.

She said the stress of trying to meet the AFL's standards was 'too great'.

The AFL released its Gender Diversity Policy, which governs the participation of 'trans and non-binary people' in August 2018.

The policy demands that players can prove that their testosterone levels have been maintained below a threshold for at least two years.
