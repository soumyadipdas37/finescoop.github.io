An 'ultra rare' furry Baby Yoda Ooshie has fetched nearly $100,000 in bids on eBay after a shopper attempted to sell the collectable in the hope of making some extra cash.

The seller, from Sydney's Warriewood on the Northern Beaches, listed The Child figurine from Star Wars for a starting bid of $100 on Saturday after he found one of the 100 sought-after Ooshies that's currently circulating around Australia.

The first ever ultra rare Ooshie from Woolworths to emerge on eBay this year has since soared to a staggering $99,400 following 95 consecutive bids.

The sale ends on the evening of Saturday, September 19.

'Baby Yoda Ooshies - Ultra Rare. First on eBay, individually numbered 059. Not to be confused with the normal green Yoda, this one is the baby and has felt/fur clothing,' the seller wrote in the eBay ad. 

The Child joins the 36-piece collectable set, featuring iconic characters from Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Pixar.

The ultra rare furry Thor will also be in hot demand among shoppers, with just 100 of the figurines circulating around the country.

The rare collectables come just weeks after a 'leaked' picture on social media emerged revealing the never-before-seen 'furry' versions of Thor and The Child.
