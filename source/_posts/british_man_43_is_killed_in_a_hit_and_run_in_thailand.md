A British man was killed by a hit-and-run driver who knocked him off his motorbike in Thailand last night. 

The 43-year-old Briton was hit by a truck as he drove back from a meal with friends in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima, police said. 

Rescuers found him lying face down with no pulse in a pool of blood, and attempts to revive him with CPR proved fruitless, according to the Bangkok Post. 

The truck driver is thought to have fled the scene but police are hoping to track them down with surveillance cameras.

The crash occurred at an intersection near the Phon Lan gate, part of an old city wall in Nakhon Ratchasima in north-east Thailand. 

The 43-year-old Briton had been eating with friends not far from the scene of the crash before police were called to the accident late at night. 

Authorities have not yet released his name while they go about informing the dead man's relatives. 

It is not known whether the man was a British expat, but tourists are currently barred from the country because of coronavirus. 

In normal times, British nationals make more than a million visits to Thailand every year, according to the UK Foreign Office. 

However, the borders were closed in March as the pandemic escalated around the world.  

Quarantine rules were tightened in July after two imported cases forced more than 400 people to self-isolate in Thailand. 

Thailand yesterday reached 100 days without a locally transmitted case of the virus, a stretch which only New Zealand and Vietnam have previously managed.
