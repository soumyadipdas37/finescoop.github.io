Danny Cipriani's fiancée Victoria Rose O'Callaghan has revealed she has gained 20lbs over lockdown after gorging on sweet treats from Marks and Spencer. 

The 39-year-old grandmother took to Instagram on Friday to discuss her weight gain as well as vowing to stop editing her photos. 

Victoria said now was the time for her to embrace her 'pimples, wrinkles and wobbly bits' as she goes on a 'journey of self love'.

In a lengthy post alongside a make-up free selfie- bar eyelash extensions- Victoria wrote: 'At the beginning of this year I was in a great routine. I was fit, skin was clear, life was good. I was 20lb lighter than my current weight (still don't work in kg - it's still St and lbs when I went to school, still St and lbs when I was at UNI too- that's for them trolls in the back that like to tell me I lack education). 

'Back to my point, Covid came and like the majority of the population my routine went down the drain, however I embraced it yet despised it.

'Them moment on the lips lifetime on the hip foods became more frequent and before I knew it I was 20lb heavier.'

Making a change Victoria went on to say she has been guilty of photo editing, but 'not anymore'

'I moaned about it everyday whilst gorging on Percy Pigs from M&S.

'Swinging it back round to my point again. Photo editing. It's become so bad, my heart is bleeding for the people that truly detest their own reflection to a point they're editing their photos to resemble caricature cartoons.'

Victoria went on to say she has been guilty of photo editing, but 'not anymore'.

She said: 'The amount of life people are missing out on because they're too busy worrying about how they look is saddening. Me included. 

To be wed: Danny will become a stepfather to Victoria's two children, Jade Austin, 24, and a teenage son, 14, when the pair marry 

'It's time to live girls. It's time to embrace and own every single pimple, wrinkle and wobbly bit. 

'Nobody's perfect, however the way we look at ourselves can be. Embark on the journey of self love, I am.'   

Earlier this week, rugby player Danny, 32, and Victoria sparked rumours that they may already have tied the knot following a whirlwind engagement.

On Wednesday evening Danny took to Instagram to introduce his new 'wife' to his followers, as he referred to her as Victoria Cipriani.

Alongside a stunning selfie of his other half, Danny wrote: 'Introducing @victoriarosecipriani - pinch myself every day!' 

Danny will become a stepfather to her two children, Jade Austin, 24, and a teenage son, 14, when the pair marry. 

The sportsman will take on the role of step-grandfather after Victoria's daughter Jade became a mum four years ago.

Danny's fiancée gave birth to her first child when she was just 14, with the pair often mistaken for sisters now that Jade has a daughter of her own.

The pair went public with their relationship in June, with Danny saying the mental health campaigner makes him 'the happiest man in the world.
