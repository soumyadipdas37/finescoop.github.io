Jersey Shore: Family Vacation star Angelina Pivarnick received a $350K settlement from New York City over repeated sexual harassment she experienced while working as a FDNY EMT between 2015-2018.

In her 2019 lawsuit, the 34-year-old reality star claimed she was harassed by two superiors while working at the Rossville Station in Staten Island, according to the New York Daily News.

Angelina alleged EMS Lieutenant David Rudnitzky 'groped her and begged her for sex' and asked her in front of a male colleague in 2018: 'How many guys on Jersey Shore have you f***ed?'

Pivarnick also claimed that Lieutenant Jonathan Schechter made 'repeated sexual advances' in the form of 'suggestive text messages that she often didn't respond to.'

'The FDNY takes allegations of sexual harassment seriously,' FDNY Law Department spokesman Nicholas Paolucci told the mag.

'Ms. Pivarnick's claim was fully investigated, and the appropriate corrective action was taken. This settlement was in the best interests of the city.'
