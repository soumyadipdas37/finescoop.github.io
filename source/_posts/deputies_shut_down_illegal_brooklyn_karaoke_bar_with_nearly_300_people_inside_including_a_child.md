A Brooklyn bar was shut down over the weekend after sheriff’s deputies found nearly 300 people inside, including a child under the age of 10, officials say.

Authorities checked in on karaoke bar Legend KTV in Borough Park on 954 61st Street early Sunday morning around 2am and found 281 people inside, including a child.

Deputies discovered the bar had an obstructed exit, excessed occupancy rules, and, had its liquor license revoked in 2019.

Deputies say the bar (right behind the truck) had an obstructed exit, excessed occupancy rules, and, had its liquor license revoked in 2019 and six people were arrested for multiple offenses.

Deputies said they found patrons drinking, dancing and smoking while exceeding the bar’s occupancy limit of 245.

They found patrons not wearing masks or social distancing.

The young child was dancing 'where alcoholic beverages were being served,' the sheriff’s office said to the New York Post.

Six people were arrested for multiple offenses including child endangerment. 

Those charges include liquor-law violations, violating Mayor Bill de Blasio’s coronavirus restrictions, using unlicensed security guards and endangering the welfare of a child. 

The Sheriff's office announced the shutdown on Sunday

The Liquor Authority revoked the bar’s license for 'failing to comply with applicable health, safety and governmental regulations' and selling booze in parts of the business where it wasn’t licensed to serve alcohol. 

Legend KTV is the third karaoke bar closed by New York City’s Sheriff’s OFffice and the state Liquor Authority in the past two weeks. 

On September 1 the sheriff’s office shut down a Queens karaoke bar for similar violations.

Deputies busted the CJ Diamond Café on College Point Boulevard around 11.30pm, leading 100 patrons running for the exits.

On August 31 another Queens bar SOHO KTV & Bar on Farrington Street in Flushing was shut down for serving alcohol and food indoors to about 75 customers. The patrons were forced to leave and two managers were cited for violations.  

New York City reports 231,824 cases of COVID-19 and 19,090 confirmed deaths and 4,646 probably deaths as of Monday.

Indoor dining is forbidden in New York City, but places outside the city are allowed to have indoor dining at 50 percent capacity.
