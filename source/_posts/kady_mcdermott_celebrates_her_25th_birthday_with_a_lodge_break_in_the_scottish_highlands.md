Kady eagerly documented every moment of her journey to Glasgow for her birthday break, including the stunning natural views during her two-hour drive from the airport. 

The star joked she'd be tucking into endless plates of seafoods during the trip, as she posted a snap of her plates of oysters and mussels.

It appeared that she was joined by her boyfriend Myles Barnett for the break, after they enjoyed a pre-birthday meal with her family the previous evening. 

Kady also posted a snap of her pretty birthday decorations, gushing she was 'so lucky' to experience the joys of her birthday break.

The duo bought a Hertfordshire property together in April 2019 with plans to completely transform it into a two-storey house. 

The brunette blamed their split on the pressure of the build which caused them to argue, as she joked that their renovation has been more stressful than having a baby.  

She wrote: 'Just to stop all the personal dms because we are literally get one every single minute, which is understandable.

Break away: She eagerly documented her birthday celebrations for her followers

'Me and Myles are will both be living in this house as a couple, couples do argue. It is a very exciting time for us both but also ridiculously stressful.

'Me and Myles can't wait to live in our forever home and will continue to share our journey with you.'

'Now I understand when people say renovating/moving home is more stressful than having a baby.' (sic)
