Police have raided the head office of a disability support provider who allegedly left woman in their care to rot in her own excrement. 

Ann Marie Smith, 54, who had cerebral palsy, died on April 6 from septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores and malnourishment.  

Detectives from the Major Crime squad searched the Integrity Care SA office in Edwardstown, south Adelaide, to seize evidence on Thursday morning.

South Australia Police raided the office of Ms Smith's National Disability Insurance Scheme care providers, Integrity Care SA, (pictured above) on Thursday morning

Ms Smith died at Royal Hospital Adelaide and it is believed she was severely neglected for a year prior to her death.

The 54-year-old lived alone in putrid conditions at her Adelaide home and relied on carers under the National Disability Insurance Scheme to look after her. 

Police allege Ms Smith's jewellery was taken, her money was stolen and she was left in the same chair for 12 months. 

Her carer Rosemary Maione, 69, was arrested at a Hectorville home and charged with manslaughter on August 6.  

Detective Superintendent Des Bray said the Integrity Care head office and a home at Huntfield Heights were raided as part of an ongoing investigation. 

'We've shifted our focus to the role of others employed or running Integrity Care SA who had a responsibility to deliver care,' he explained.   

Supt Bray called on Integrity Care employees to talk to police and assist with the investigation.    

'Some employees have steadfastly refused to cooperate and have done nothing whatsoever to assist the investigation or to ensure that this sort of neglect could never happen to anybody again.

South Australian police have released photos from inside Ms Smith's home where she sat in her final days. The 54-year-old was allegedly left in the same chair for 12 months 

'We know some employees were concerned about operating practices and we plan to speak to more of them in the coming days,' he explained.

Supt Bray urged anyone with information about Ms Smith to contact police.   

'We encourage employees to cooperate in this investigation, so we can ensure this never happens again.

'It's time for all employees, past and present, to do the right thing and speak to investigators by phoning Crime Stoppers tonight.

'Detectives will be available to talk to anybody who rings Crime Stoppers and anybody who's worked for Integrity SA,' he said.   

Police allege Maione treated Ms Smith (pictured above with dogs) with severe neglect and also stole money and jewellery from the 54-year old 

Maione (pictured) was granted a strict home detention bail at her house in Hectorville 

The investigation has already received at least 78 calls with information in relation to Ms Smith.    

The National Disability Insurance Scheme commission has been investigating Integrity Care, which took two weeks to report Ms Smith's death to the NDIS Commission.

The provider was slapped with a $12,600 fine over its failure to notify the Commission within 24 hours and has been banned from operating.   

Integrity Care will no longer be a registered provider of NDIS-funded supports and services and will be banned from providing them to people covered by NDIS.

The Commission's investigation into Integrity Care remains ongoing and further regulatory action may be taken. 

Maione was employed by Integrity Care until May 18, days after the police investigation into Ms Smith's death was launched.

She was granted strict home detention bail and will be electronically monitored at her Hectorville home.
