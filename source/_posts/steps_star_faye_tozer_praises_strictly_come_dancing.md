Steps star Faye Tozer has praised Strictly Come Dancing for including a same-sex couple in the line-up after her bandmate H made history on Dancing On Ice. 

The singer, 44, told how it was 'so very exciting' on Thursday that the BBC dancing show was including an all-female pairing in the series that is set to air in October. 

Faye said it was 'amazing' that H set the bar for a same-sex pairing after he used his exit speech on the ITV show to declare it was 'Strictly's turn' to follow suit. 

Praise: Steps star Faye Tozer, 44, has praised Strictly Come Dancing for including a same-sex pairing in the line-up after her bandmate H made history on Dancing On Ice

Speaking to hosts Bobby Norris, 34, and Stephen Leng on Access All Areas for FUBAR Radio, about the return of Strictly Come Dancing, she said: 'I think that it's really exciting that they've gone for it in the climate of things. Actually having a same sex couple is so very exciting.' 

Ian 'H' Watkins, 44, and pro skater Matt Evers, 44, made history as Dancing On Ice's first ever same-sex duo, and were inundated with praise from fans when they took to the rink for the first time in January.    

Speaking about how Strictly is following in the footsteps of ITV's Dancing On Ice, with Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams, 37, in a same-sex pairing, she said: 'If that set the bar or even encouraged them to do it, or even made it feel like it was possible, that's just amazing.'

Group: Steps have recently released their latest single, What The Future Holds, written by pop star Sia with Faye describing how the band is 'family' who 'look after each other' (pictured in 1998) 

Faye, who reached the finals of the BBC show in 2018 with her partner Giovanni Pernice, added: 'I think it's really important these days that everybody is represented, and this is the beginning of things to come, so it's very exciting.'   

Asked if she would consider joining the Strictly judging panel, she added: 'Absolutely, I'd love to do something like that! Yes is the answer!' 

Speaking about the band's breakup in 2001 followed by the reality show, Steps Reunion, in 2011 to work through their issues, Faye said: 'At the time it was painful but cathartic and I don't think we'd be here without doing that series. 

Exciting: The Tragedy songstress revealed how the band are 'so lucky' to be 'in control' of their music with the group 'offered songs by really incredible writers

'A lot of questions needed to be answered and we needed to lay stuff to rest, water under the bridge. And I think we're stronger because of that now.'  

Steps have recently released their latest single, What The Future Holds, written by pop star Sia with Faye describing how the band is 'family' who 'look after each other'.

She said: 'The more time goes on, the better place we're in. We're family, we look after each other, we can support each other's separate projects outside Steps and not have a qualm about that because at the end of the day, we're preparing for the next chapter in Steps every time. 

Making history: Ian 'H' Watkins, 44, and pro skater Matt Evers made history as Dancing On Ice's first ever same-sex duo in January 

'I think everyone's very, very protective of each other and the band.'

The Tragedy songstress revealed how the band are 'so lucky' to be 'in control' of their music with the group 'offered songs by really incredible writers' 

Faye added: 'We've never tried to be anything that we're not and the people who are fans thoroughly enjoy great pop music.'

She continued: 'I just think we're so lucky because nowadays, I think we are being offered songs by really incredible writers. I think because we're more in control as well. 

'I think the quality of the songs and our recordings are a standard that we really love and we feel confident in.'

The Steps star revealed how the band are 'in a different place' now and are not producing music to 'chase a number one' but are doing it 'for our fans'.     

Wow: Faye reached the finals of the BBC show in 2018 with her partner Giovanni Pernice
