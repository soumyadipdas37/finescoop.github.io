Rishi Sunak has cancelled plans for a Budget later this year amid fears over the economic impact of a second wave of coronavirus.

Questions had already been raised over whether the Chancellor's set piece autumn announcement, broadly penned in for November, would go ahead.

But the Treasury this afternoon confirmed it had been put back to allow him to focus on dealing with the impact of the second wave of coronavirus on the economy.

Mr Sunak this afternoon confirmed he will  tomorrow outline plans to protect millions of jobs and save thousands of businesses from going under as a new round of coronavirus restrictions threatens to throttle the UK economy.

The Chancellor is to set out his 'Winter Economy Plan' in the House of Commons tomorrow amid growing unrest from MPs and businesses over the return of working from home and new restrictions on hospitality firms.

Germany's has used its Kurzarbeit job subsidy measures during the coronavirus pandemic and has recently extended its use until the end of 2021.

Unlike the British furlough programme, an emergency scheme which pays companies to pay employees not to work, the Kurzarbeit system, which already existed before the pandemic, surrounds short-time working.



It allows employers to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job.

The government pays workers a percentage of the money they would have got for working those lost hours. 

According to the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research, at the height of the pandemic, half of all German firms had at least some of their staff on the scheme. 

Influential British political figures including former prime minister Gordon Brown have urged the government to bring in such a scheme, or a similar French-style system, after the furlough scheme ends in October.

Facing calls for a Furlough 2.0 scheme to be set up he tweeted: 'As our response to coronavirus adapts, tomorrow afternoon I will update the House of Commons on our plans to continue protecting jobs through the winter. '

The Chancellor is being urged by business chiefs to 'get around the table' and agree new job support measures after Boris Johnson ditched his back to work drive and imposed a range of new coronavirus restrictions. 

Companies fear the new crackdown will deal a hammer blow to already struggling firms especially with the furlough programme closing at the end of October.

But reports suggest Mr Sunak is planning a new scheme to prevent job losses after retail bosses warned that up to a million furloughed workers could be made redundant without another bailout.  

The mooted plans being looked at by the Chancellor would see the Government and firms share the cost of topping up wages for employees who are only able to work part-time because of the pandemic.

Sir Keir Starmer put the pressure on Mr Johnson on the issue during PMQs today as he said ending furlough meant 'health measures and economic measures are now dangerously out of sync’.

Mr Johnson replied: ‘Let’s be in absolutely no doubt that the work that this Government has done to protect the economy of this country, to support the jobs of 12 million people through the furlough scheme and overall expenditure of about £160 billion has been unexampled anywhere else in the world.

‘I think he should pay tribute to the Chancellor and his work and we will go forward with further creative and imaginative schemes to keep our economy moving.’
