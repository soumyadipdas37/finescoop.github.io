Make-out scenes look a whole lot different on the set of Riverdale these days.

Fans don't need to worry: There will still be plenty of kissing in the upcoming season, including between KJ Apa's character Archie and Camila Mendes' Veronica.

But KJ, 23, revealed on Instagram this week that in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the stars of the show are washing their mouths out before every take.

On Wednesday, KJ shared a video recorded on set before a scene he filmed with Camila.

'Our new normal is washing our mouths before every take of a makeout scene...' he wrote.

In the clip, the two are handed identical tiny cups filled with liquid. He doesn't specify what's inside, though it is presumably mouthwash or alcohol to kill germs.

The two make a game of it, crossing their arms to pour the cups into their mouths at the same time.

Then, they swish. For a full minute, the pair keep the liquid in their mouths, as a woman off camera tells them how much time they have left.

Finally, when the time is up, they spit into plastic bags that can easily be disposed of.

The video has had quite a few comments, including from some of KJ's fellow Riverdale stars.

'That s*** burns,' wrote Lili Reinhart.

'Spit don't swallow,' wrote Skeet Ulrich.

Some fans, though, expressed disbelief that the actors weren't doing this before the pandemic, while costar Bernadette Beck asked that it become standard for kissing scenes.

Hollywood has found a few ways to operate safely during the pandemic.

Bold & the Beautiful producer Bradley Bell told Insider in June that the actors' real-life romantic partners are stepping in for smooching scenes these days.

'So if you see hands touching faces in close proximity from a wide shot, instead of a stunt double we'll have a love-scene double, where it will be the husband or the wife doing the actual touching,' he said.

'Then when we edit it together, it will look like our couple on screen.'

As for sex scenes, they're using blow-up dolls in wigs and makeup.

'When we were reviewing the scripts, we started taking out all the romantic scenes and [the scripts] just fell flat,' he told the New York Post. 'We put our heads together trying to figure out a way to make these scenes work without breaking the eight-foot [distancing] rule...and we brought out a doll we used years ago as a corpse.'
