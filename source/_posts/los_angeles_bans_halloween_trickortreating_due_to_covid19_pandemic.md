Los Angeles County is outlawing trick-or-treating for 2020, amid fears that the Halloween custom could inadvertently spread COVID-19. 

Public health officials announced the ban Tuesday, also declaring that outdoor parties and carnivals scheduled for October 31 will also be prohibited. 

In an official memo, the LA County Department of Public Health stated: 'Door to door trick or treating is not allowed because it can be very difficult to maintain proper social distancing on porches and at front doors especially in neighborhoods that are popular with trick-or-treaters.' 

The document additionally stated: 'Gatherings or Parties with non-household members are not permitted even if they are conducted outdoors.

'Carnivals, festivals, live entertainment, and haunted house attractions are [also] not allowed.'

Officials also preempted that locals may use their vehicles to trick-or-treat, and have proactively put a stop that potential behavior, declaring: 'Trunk or treating” events where children go from car to car instead of door to door to receive treats are also not allowed.'

California has reported the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country, and Los Angeles County has been hit hardest by the virus. 

The county has reported a staggering 249,000 COVID infections - a third of the 746,000 clocked statewide. 

As of Wednesday morning, 6,032 LA County residents have died from the disease. 

 

The LA County Department of Public Health memo does not disclose whether there will be monetary fines for those who breach the new rules. 

It's likely that other counties across the United States will impose similar bans on traditional Halloween rituals given the country is still struggling to contain the coronavirus outbreak. 

However, LA officials still say that residents will be able to enjoy the annual holiday if they act safely. 

Halloween movie nights at drive-in cinemas and Halloween themed meals at outdoor restaurants are still allowed under Los Angeles law. 

The experts also suggest that online parties and 'car parades that comply with public health guidance' are two COVID-safe ways to bring joy to families looking for some light relief amid the pandemic.
