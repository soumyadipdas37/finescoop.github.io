A female construction worker in China has cheated certain death after a 31-inch steel rod speared into her body from her backside during a horrifying accident.

The woman, known by her surname Xiang, had the metal bar protruding from her right shoulder after falling onto it from a 10ft-high platform at a construction site in China's southern province Guangdong.

She miraculously survived the incident after the doctors performed a three-hour operation to remove the pole that avoided her vital organs and main blood vessels.

The woman, known by her surname Xiang, had the metal bar protruding from her right shoulder after falling onto it from a 10ft-high platform at a construction site in China

The female builder from Chinese southern province Guangdong survived the horrifying incident after the doctors performed a three-hour operation to remove the long pole

Ms Xiang was working on a construction site on Thursday when she accidentally fell from the height, according to a report from Guangdong Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

She landed on an 80-centimetre (31-inch) steel rod that skewered her entire upper body from her buttock.

The worker later told reporters that her blood 'was gushing out like a fountain before I had even realised what was happening'. 

The woman was rushed to the Guangdong hospital after her colleagues cut the metal bar to transport her from the building site.

After examining the patient, doctors found the majority of the pole had speared through the woman’s body but missed her vital organs and main blood vessels.

After conducting a three-hour emergency surgery, a team of surgeons successfully removed the steel bar from Ms Xiang.

Dr Li Jia, a chief medic at the hospital, told Guangdong Southern Television: 'The operation went smoothly. She was fortunate that it had avoided the large blood vessels in the lungs and chest. 

'Although there was some bleeding, we quickly repaired it after pulling out the pole.'

Ms Xiang is said to be in stable condition while recovering at the Guangdong hospital.

In July, another Chinese builder survived from being impaled by two steel rods on his neck and chest after falling onto the bars.

One of the metal bars rammed through his neck while the other speared through his chest after he had fallen onto them in eastern China's Jiangsu province.

The man survived after both poles had missed his vital organs and main blood vessels, according to rescuers.
