Malin Andersson looked the epitome of autumn as she arrived at a photoshoot on Monday.

Embracing the drop in temperature, the former Love Island star, 27, rocked a figure-hugging taupe dress which she teamed with tan ankle boots.

She looked glammed up for the shoot, which she shared to Instagram was about her late daughter and mother.

'Just did the most liberating shoot on grieving my daughter and mum,' she shared to Instagram stories, as well as some behind-the-scenes snaps.

The shoot appeared to be an interview too, filmed at the studios in London's Kentish Town.

Malin looked bronzed for the shoot, wearing her raven locks tumbling around her features.

She added a cosy stone jacket to the look and carried a black purse and a dolly as she arrived for the shoot.

Heartbreaking: She carried a dolly with her, which is presumed to be a representation of her own baby Consy who she welcomed with her now-ex Tom Kemp in December 2018. Consy tragically died at four weeks old

It's presumed the dolly is a representation of her own baby Consy who she welcomed with her now-ex Tom Kemp in December 2018.

But Consy tragically passed away at just four weeks old after being born premature.

She is named after Malin's own mother, who she lost to breast cancer in 2017. Malin lost her father 26 years ago to skin cancer.

In a recent chat with MailOnline, Malin revealed that she is 'looking for love' and has started 'going on dates again' after her abusive ex-boyfriend Tom was jailed a few weeks ago.

The 2016 Love Island star described how she would like to start a family and have 'one or two' children adding how she is a 'huge believer in the law of attraction'. 

The mental health campaigner also described how she 'benefitted' from lockdown which gave her the opportunity 'to do a lot more work on herself'.

She said: 'To be fair, do you know what, I am. I have recently started going on dates again which I haven't done for over a year. So I am looking for love - how about that?'  

Malin, who also spoke about body positivity at the Lovehoney virtual love camp, added: 'I do want a family - I want a husband.

Justice: Malin's former boyfriend Tom, 29, was jailed for ten months earlier this month after beating her (pictured in February 2019)

'I want a good-looking little basketball player. I do like a basketball player and I want my family. I want a few kids maybe one or two I want a little dog.' 

The couple split in 2019 after a violent relationship, and earlier this month, Tom was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

Beauty: Malin also described how it is important to be 'open and raw' with topics such as sexual empowerment

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year.

But Tom, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time. 

Malin has spoken candidly about her grief and also works as a carer.  

The TV star returned to her job as a carer for the elderly and terminally ill during lockdown after feeling a 'void' while away from the sector. 

Speaking about lockdown, she told MailOnline: 'I kept myself busy - I was volunteering with the caring work, I was doing mental health lives everyday on my Instagram.' 

'Living alone was fine by me I think it gave me a good time to do a lot more work on myself so I think I benefitted from it.'

Open: Malin, who promotes body positivity on social media, explained how edited pictures can be damaging for young people

Malin also described how it is important to be 'open and raw' with topics such as sexual empowerment. 

The TV star said: 'I think being sexually open is just as empowering as being body positive - it all kind of intertwines.' 

Speaking about how her perception of herself has altered since appearing on Love Island, she added: 'I think it has changed a lot for me because I was someone completely different back then and my main focus was on my appearance. I think it is all a journey.' 

Describing her attitude to sex, she continued: 'My attitude to it is to just be you and be yourself. 

'But say if you are in bed with your partner and you are feeling insecure and uncomfortable then you are not going to feel good and you're not going to be enjoying the experience of enjoying sex with them.

Malin also revealed how she is a 'fan of lingerie' and told how that is her 'all over' with it making her feel most empowered. 

She said: 'Knowing that I have got a nice set of underwear on and say I have a suit on, or a dress on, only I know that matching set underneath and it empowers you because I am not doing it for anyone else - I am doing it for me.' 

Loss: Breast Cancer Awareness is a cause close to Malin's heart, as her mother Consy (pictured) sadly died from the disease in 2017. Her father passed away from skin cancer 26 years ago

Malin, who promotes body positivity on social media, explained how edited pictures can be damaging for young people and told how there should be a 'disclaimer' added to posts which have been altered. 

'Yes I think there needs to be a disclaimer. I think it is just a warped image of society at the minute,' she told. 

'A filter is fine, like a nice little glittery filter, on your Snapchat of Instagram - I use them. 

'But when it is changing your whole face and giving you a nose job, bringing you cheeks and jaw in and becoming somebody that you are actually not. 

'These younger girls are looking at that and so their value of themselves is going down without them even knowing it.'  

Pain: Malin's daughter Consy died aged just four weeks old after being born prematurely

The reality star also uses her platform to discuss grief. 

She said: 'The thing is with grief is that it is very sporadical and that it is not routine. When I am feeling down I will go and sit in my meditation area and get my journal out.'   

Asked about the worst thing that someone has said to her on social media at the Lovehoney virtual camp, she said: 'When my daughter was in hospital they said unplug her tube already. 

'That is trolling for me. When it comes to my exterior experience I don't really care - when it comes to things like that they have mental issues. 

'I just swipe, block and delete. They are not well. In order to say something like that and inflict pain onto another person they are definitely not well.' 

However the body positivity campaigner, who has 690,000 Instagram followers, told how she has 'awesome' fans.

She said: 'I have such cool followers - like I love my followers they are all awesome. You get the odd troll but I blocked out comments so they can't comment certain words I have got a filter on. 

'It is the people that know me, that know my journey, know why I am doing it - that is what I care about - I don't really care about anyone else.

Malin described how she starts each day with 30 minutes of meditation and has a 'dedicated routine' to keep her 'happy endorphins' flowing.  

She said: 'My whole outlook on life has completely changed because I don't care about the fame anymore I don't care about people recognising me - how I used to be after Love Island.' 

Malin, who said she would like to move to America to be closer to her brother, described how she is excited for the release of her book and podcast which centre on 'finding your own light within yourself'.
