This stunning image of a lone futuristic skyscraper in the city of Saint Petersburg was taken by Russian photographer Sergei Poletaev. He said: 'There are no other high-rising buildings in the area, just the water and one or two-storey suburban houses. This is why this tower looks more like a sculpture or an artwork rather than an office skyscraper' 

Ilaria Ronchi, who is Italian but lives in the Netherlands, took this breathtaking image in the Namib Desert. She said: 'This photo is really precious to me. I just remember how overwhelming it was to be surrounded by perfect natural sand creations'

This jaw-dropping shot of Australia's Whitsunday Islands was taken by Belgian photographer Johan Vandenhecke. He said: 'This place is so pure! It's only accessible by boat, so we slept on a boat in a neighbouring bay in order to get here in the morning'

On the left is a drone shot by British photographer Matthew Perks of Padstow in Cornwall. He said: 'It is hard to believe places like this exist in the UK.

He said: 'We were looking for the best sunset and we eventually found it at Kirkjufell, the iconic Icelandic mountain. I didn’t have my tripod, and I couldn’t get a long exposure. I was trying to find the best angle for that reflex to get the shot right'

On the left is an otherworldly image snapped by British photographer James Theo in Utah. He called the photo 'Life on Mars'.
