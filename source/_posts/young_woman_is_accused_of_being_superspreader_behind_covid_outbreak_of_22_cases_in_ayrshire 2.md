A young Scottish woman has been accused of spreading coronavirus by continuing to attend parties after holidaying with friends who fell ill with symptoms.

The unnamed 'superspreader' allegedly went to pubs and 'several parties' before herself testing positive. 

A cluster of 22 cases has since sprang up in Ayrshire, which medical officials confirmed were linked to house parties.

A major contact tracing operation is now underway to stop the virus snowballing in the region.

Angry locals have pointed the finger at a young woman who is believed to have ignored advice to self-isolate after returning from overseas on August 21 with two friends who suffered symptoms.

A parent told the Ayrshire Advertiser: 'She has been to several parties, one of them was in Kilmarnock.

'She knew that her other friends were self-isolating, it's disgusting.'

Another source told the paper the woman visited pubs in Ayr before testing positive for Covid-19 after taking a test on August 26.

NHS Ayrshire and Arran Test and Protect Team are starting to contact those connected to the house parties.

Dr Crawford McGuffie, Medical Director said: 'NHS Ayrshire & Arran's Health Protection Team is currently conducting a contact tracing exercise following a number of individuals who have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.

'These positive cases have been linked to a number of house parties.'

Two staff members at Sainsbury's in Prestwick, South Ayrshire, are among those self-isolating after testing positive. 

Coronavirus is waning in Scotland and the country has only reported three deaths in a month.
