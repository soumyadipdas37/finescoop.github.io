Real Madrid will be breathing a sigh of relief after finally getting the bulk of Gareth Bale's wages off their books this season.

The Welshman, who currently earns £600,000 per week before tax, has been burning a huge hole in Florentino Perez's pocket, especially since the Spanish club were getting very little in return for their huge investment.

And according to AS, Bale ended up costing Real an eye-watering £21,638 (23,800 euros) for every minute he spent on the field last season, having been exiled to the bench by manager Zinedine Zidane.

 Gareth Bale earned huge sums of money by doing very little for Real Madrid last season

Welshman was snapped goofing around on the bench while being paid handsomely by Real

In total, Bale played 1,260 minutes across 20 Real matches in all competitions - 27.5 per cent of the total the team played - scoring three goals and contributing two assists in another campaign plagued by injury.

He did manage to feature in two matches following the post-lockdown restart but the damage was done long before then as his relationship with Zidane continued to deteriorate.

But now, Zidane and the club have their wish as Bale looks set to complete a sensational return to former club Tottenham on a season-long loan, where Real will subsidise a part of his wages.

It remains unclear what will happen after his loan at Spurs comes to an end, considering that his 'deal for life' at Real runs out in 2022, but that is problem for another day as far as Real are concerned. 

Zidane only handed Bale 1,260 minutes last season, which costed the club £21,631 per minute

Bale moved to the Spanish capital from Spurs for a then-world-record £86m in 2013 and had helped them to two of his four Champions League triumphs when he signed those new terms, scoring 50 league goals in 90 games for the club. 

The former Spurs ace fell out of favour under Zidane and became consigned to the bench or, on more than one occasion, not even included in the squad.

Real have been paying the hefty price of handing him such a lucrative contract just under four years ago but he now looks set to get more minutes back under his belt – should he stay fit.
