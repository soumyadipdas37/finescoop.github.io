Liverpool are closing in on a deal to land star midfielder Thiago Alcantara after formally contacting Bayern Munich. 

The Spain international has been persistently linked with the Premier League champions since July, when he made it clear that he would not be signing another contract in Germany.

Thiago has 12 months remaining on his current terms and Bayern want to recoup £25m.

The deal is worth an initial £20m guaranteed, rising to £25m in bonuses. Thiago will sign a four-year deal and wear the No 6 jersey.

Jurgen Klopp has been tight-lipped about Thiago whenever he has been asked him in recent months, acknowledging simply that he is 'an excellent player', but it is now clear he wants to add the 29-year-old to his squad.

Michael Edwards, Liverpool's Sporting Director, has been in discussions with his counterpart at Bayern, Hasan Salihamidzic, and while there has been no agreement yet it now appears the transfer is heading in only one direction – Thiago is heading to Anfield.

Thiago has his heart set on playing for Liverpool and finalising personal terms is not expected to be a problem in the event of Liverpool and Bayern coming to a solution on the fee.

Should the deal be completed, it would be a statement of intent from the club, as they look to defend their title.

The move for Thiago is not, however, linked directly to the future of Gini Wijnaldum, who has also entered the final 12 months of his contract and has been persistently linked with Barcelona and a reunion with Ronald Koeman.

Wijnaldum had 'positive' discussions with Klopp after returning from international duty last week and while Liverpool would look to command a similar fee from Barcelona as Bayern want from Thiago, neither situation is linked.

Klopp holds Wijnaldum, who has been a constant presence in his midfield, in the highest regard but Thiago has different qualities – particularly with his passing – to Liverpool's other midfielders and the manager believes he will add another dimension to their play.

A feature in recent weeks of questions to Klopp has revolved around whether he needs to add to new players, in light of their rivals strengthening, but this is an emphatic illustration that Liverpool are not prepared to settle for second best.

Thiago, who was brought to Bayern by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola in 2013, has won seven Bundesliga titles in a row. 

He made 40 appearances across all competitions in 2019-20, scoring three goals and providing two assists.
