A day at the beach with former boyfriend Jaden Smith was followed by dinner with another male acquaintance as Sofia Richie ventured out on Monday evening. 

The daughter of Motown legend Lionel Richie was accompanied by close friend Andrew Beyer while dining at celebrity restaurant of choice Nobu Malibu. 

In accordance with current safety guidelines, both wore protective face masks as they exited the eatery hand in hand later that night, with the coverings still in place as they shared a goodnight kiss.

Opting for a plain white T-shirt and high-slung trousers, Sofia, 22, looked typically stylish as the pair prepared to make separate journeys home. 

The young socialite added to her look with a simple black handbag, while her hair was neatly pulled into a conventional ponytail.  

Joining Sofia, Andrew was dressed down in a white T-shirt and black jeans, teamed with a grey windbreaker jacket.

Two days previously Sofia was spotted canoodling with her longtime friend and former flame Jaden on Malibu beach.  

In the evening, they pair, who reportedly dated in 2012, met up with an extended group at Nobu, where they occupied neighbouring seats.

Though it's unclear whether or not she is rekindling her romance with Jaden, Sofia is currently single following her split from ex Scott Disick, 37.

Sofia and Scott ended their three-year relationship in May, following the Talentless founder's brief stint at a Colorado rehab facility.

Two-months after their breakup, the pair reunited at a Fourth Of July party in Malibu.

But by mid-August, numerous outlets reported that Scott and Sofia decided to end their relationship for good.
