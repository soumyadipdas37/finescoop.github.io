She's known for her flowing blonde locks.

The Scottish TV personality sent temperatures soaring in a ribbed asymmetric top and matching thong bottom which exposed her unusual tattoos. 

Laura decided to go make-up free as she showcased her svelte physique in the selfie video before heading out to the beach. 

The beauty styled her fresh brunette locks in a loose wave after documenting her revamp from the salon on Tuesday.

Taking to her Instagram stories, Laura told her fans 'this is the reality of my hair' as she revealed her natural and extension-free locks.

She then told her followers that she was planning on going darker and shorter, ahead of her big transformation.

Laura then shared a clip of her newly-dyed brunette hair ahead of her extensions, with the Scottish beauty adding: 'This little mullet situation is what happens when you bleach your hair your whole life.'

The reality star later revealed her longer tresses and ran her hands through her luxurious extensions as she displayed the finished result.     

Laura's new hair comes after she was forced to speak out earlier this month after she sparked controversy with her 'changing face'.

Honest: Taking to her Instagram stories, Laura told her fans 'this is the reality of my hair' as she revealed her natural and extension-free locks

Laura had been filming Love Island spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George when a photo shared by her co-stars saw fans branding her unrecognisable.

Hitting back at hurtful comments with a make-up free selfie a day later, Laura said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.

'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse. 

'Like, "Laura doesn't look like Laura any more". It's really nice to read all those comments and I just think people need to get over the fact that a picture is just a picture. 

'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.'

Laura hit back after social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance.

One wrote: 'OMG is that Laura !!!!!! I did not realise that was Laura!!!!! 

Another typed: 'That's not Laura!!! I didn't even recognise her!,' while a third chimed: 'wow laura doesn't even look like laura... is that even Laura....' (sic)

Another follower referenced the reality star's cosmetic procedures as they added: 'I don't even recognise Laura since her surgery. Shame she was so pretty and didn't need to change her appearance at all.' (sic)   

The media personality has made no secret of having Botox and lip fillers in the past - treatments she claimed she planned before entering the villa in 2018.  

It's been a tough time for Laura who revealed earlier this month that she had split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom just days after moving back to Scotland.

Despite initially intending for Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off.  

Stirling born Laura told fans on an Instagram story: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north.

Abuse: Laura had been filming Love Island spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George when a photo shared by her co-stars saw fans branding her recognisable 

'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.'

Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.

Laura, who moved to the swanky Park Circus area of Glasgow earlier in the month, said she had fully hoped Tom would join her in her new home.

She had gushed that she'd never met anyone like him before adding: 'I'm still going to move to Scotland and Tom is looking to follow me up in the next six months. He's the cherry on top of the cake.'
