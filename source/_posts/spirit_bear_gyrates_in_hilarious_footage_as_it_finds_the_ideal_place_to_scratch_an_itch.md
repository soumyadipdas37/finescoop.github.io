This is the hilarious moment a rare Kermode 'spirit' bear stands on its hind legs and starts scratching its back on a wooden power pole.

A footage recorded in Terrace, British Columbia, Canada, the white bear is seen wandering up to a massive wooden power pole.

After a quick glance up, the bear stands up on its hind legs and leans its back against the pillar.

A rare Kermode bear stands up on its hind legs and leans against a wooden power pole Terrace, British Columbia, Canada, before moving up and down to scratch its back before grabbing hold of the post with a paw and trying to nibble it

Once comfortable, the bear then lifts its head up so that the top is also against the post and starts rubbing up and down against it.

Clearly enjoying itself, the bear reaches up to the pole with one of its paws and grabs hold and begins wiggling side to side.

The Kermode bear's near-rhythmic movement could almost be mistaken for dancing.

It then attempts to nibble the pole before continuing to scratch its back and then walking off into the forest.

After its back is suitable scratched, the bear climbs down from its pole and wanders off back into the forest

The video was originally recorded on August 27 and has recently re-emerged after being shared on social media.

Kermode bears, also known as spirit bears, are a sub-species of the American black bear with a rare gene that turns their fur white or cream.

Though not considered endangered, there are believed to only be around 400 Kermode bears left in the wild.

Only one in ten black bears possess the gene that turns their fur light and in order for it to be passed onto baby bears, both parents must have it.
