The Maid In Manhattan star was flashing her legs in her last snaps for the brand in a post from mid September.

 The star was also putting her midsection on display as she laid on a bed. 

J-Lo, whose next film is Marry Me with Owen Wilson, looked like a natural pinup in her photo.

In one shot she wears a thin white shirt that is pulled off one shoulder with undies and no pants.

She is laying on a bed with her snakeskin high heeled boots the focal point.

In the other shot she is in a crochet bra top and ripped jeans with a knit jacket and tennis shoes.

'I ❤️❤️❤️ my new snakeskin and sparkle boots!' said the Bronx native in her caption.

'Check out all the new styles from my #JLoJenniferLopez collection @dsw.' She then credited the photographer Greg Swalesart. Alex, Drea DeMatteo, Tamra Judge and Melissa Gorga clicked like. 

This comes after she shared her Pa' Ti video on Friday.

The siren is seen in a black top with large diamond earrings after riding in a sleek, white Rolls-Royce.

There are also shots of a stunning estate fit for a queen hinting the video, which debuted on Thursday, is full of glamour.

Looking like a redo of the hit Eighties TV show Dynasty, the teaser opens with views of the historic mansion with sprawling grounds that host several fountains and shallow ponds.

It looks like the type of place where an old fashioned murder mystery would be set.

Next a newspaper is picked off a lush green lawn.

Then Jenny is seen in a beige/brown fur coat over a gray suit with crystal lined sunglasses looking very powerful as if she is headed to a board meeting.

Her image is then seen on the cover of a newspaper where there is a story about a 'billionaire under investigation.'

Next Lopez is at a meeting in a black halter dress, her hand is seen with a black glove on as she appears to hand something off, and then she is seen from behind overlooking a city scape while in a high rise building.

The day before she was seen in another clip for Pa' Ti. In the opening of that clip, the World Of Dance star leans on Maluma and later it looks as if she was about to kiss him.

The clip begin with Jennifer in a white dress by Genny as she has her hair pulled back and leans over the up-and-coming artist. Maluma is her costar in her next film Marry Me with Owen Wilson. Lopez and Maluma - who have 25 years between them - are about to kiss as she caresses his face.  She pulls her glasses down to look at something, showing heavy eye makeup.

Then Jennifer is in a black halter top with diamond earrings; she is in a Rolls-Royce then she puts her feet up as if she is in some kind of meeting.  

She changes up her hair looks almost daily - in the morning she can have short locks and later that night it's down to her bottom. But in this clip she has curls on top of her head.

Next it is all about Maluma as he models different outfits. 

Lopez shared in her Instagram caption: 'My two song collaboration Pa’ Ti - Lonely with @Maluma is almost here! ✨ Don’t miss the @TikTok Live: Behind the Video and two-part premiere event this Thursday at 6pm EST / 3pm PST. It all starts on TikTok.'

The Bronx beauty's next film Marry Me with Maluma and Owen opens on February 12, 2021. It's a romantic comedy directed by Kat Coiro.

According to the film's website, J-Lo plays musical superstar Kat Valdez.

Owen Wilson is Charlie Gilbert, a math teacher, and they are 'total strangers who agree to marry and then get to know each other.'

The film is an 'unlikely romance about two different people searching for something real in a world where value is based on likes and followers, Marry Me is a modern love story about celebrity, marriage and social media.

'Kat Valdez (Lopez) is half of the sexiest celebrity power couple on Earth with hot new music supernova Bastian (Maluma, making his feature-film debut). As Kat and Bastian’s inescapable hit single, “Marry Me,” climbs the charts, they are about to be wed before an audience of their fans in a ceremony that will streamed across multiple platforms.'

But then things change when divorced high-school math teacher Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) has been dragged to the concert by his daughter Lou (Chloe Coleman, HBO’s Big Little Lies) and his best friend (Sarah Silverman).
