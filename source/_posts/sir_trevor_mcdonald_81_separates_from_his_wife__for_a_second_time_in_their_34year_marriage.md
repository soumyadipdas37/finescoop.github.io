Sir Trevor McDonald has split from his wife after 34 years of marriage - and 16 years after they first separated.

The veteran newsreader, 81, who rose to prominence as the presenter of ITN's News at Ten in 1992, has now moved out of his family home.

He is now living in a bachelor pad after splitting with his wife Jo, 65, a former production assistant at the news organisation.

They tied the knot in 1986 after an office romance and a year after he divorced first wife Beryl, who later remarked 'He found himself a younger, better looking girl.'

He and Jo separated in 2004 but reconciled happily until the relationship fizzled out in recent months. 

It is understood that the separation was 'amicable' and that Sir Trevor and Jo 'are still speaking' with each other.

A source told The Sun: 'It is sad but Trevor and Jo realised they weren't making one another happy any more, and that it was time to move on with their lives.'

The source went on to explain that the split was no secret among those is the couple's inner ­circle.

They added: 'He and Josephine have a long history so obviously they are still speaking, and everything is amicable.

'Trevor has moved into his own apartment and friends are joking it is his bachelor pad.' 

The couple, who share a 31-year-old son named Jack, 31, together, tied the knot in 1986.  

The news presenter also shares two children, Joanne and Tim, with his first wife Beryl who he divorced in 1985.     

Sir Trevor first rose to prominence as the presenter of ITN's News at Ten from 1992 to 1999 before going on to to host ITV's flagship current affairs programme Tonight with Trevor McDonald in 1999.

He is known for his interviews with prominent figures including Tony Blair, Nelson Mandela and former US  President Bill Clinton and was named Newscaster of the Year in 1993, 1997 and 1999.

In 1999 he was also awarded a knighthood in 1999 for his services to journalism. 

Since his retirement from nightly news in 2008, he has fronted documentaries on topics ranging from the mafia to death row.

Earlier this year, Sir Trevor said nothing in his career had compared to the 'immense, international' nature of the coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking to presenter Julie Etchingham on the ITV News podcast Coronavirus: What You Need To Know, he said: 'I don't remember a story which has so internationally involved us all.

'We are connected much more than we ever thought. We're anxious to hear what's going on all over the world.'

He added: 'It is very, very strange to go through a week knowing that you have so few things which are absolutely planned. It's a bit difficult having all the time on your hands.

'In my personal case, the lack of social contact and having to stay in a lot is at times fairly depressing, really. You just have to try and find ways of dealing with it.

'I must confess I'm not too sure I've done terribly well for finding those ways!'
