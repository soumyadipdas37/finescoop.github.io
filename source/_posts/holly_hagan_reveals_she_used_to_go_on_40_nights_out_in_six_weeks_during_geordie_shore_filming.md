Responding to one fan who asked 'how many nights out did you usually during a series?', Holly said: 'About 36-40ish! We filmed for 6 weeks with one down night per week. Not sure how we're still alive tbh'. 

Another follower asked: 'Could you ask producers not to air something if you'd one something bad when drunk? 

'Lol, no never. We wouldn't have had a show if we were allowed to do that.'

Shocking: Holly said she would go on 40 nights out over a six week period during filming

Fiesty: Holly also discussed how arguments were resolved 

Holly said as to why a new girl faced more animosity when they joined compared to a new male cast member: 'Because we were jealous and scared the boys we fancied were going to fancy them. 

'We were very insecure and young. Thankfully we got past all that.' 

'How did you manage to get over the arguments you had with people? I keep grudges!!', queried another.

Holly said: 'This was actually a really good lesson in communication. Usually if you argue with a friend you would text the next day to apologise.

'Well we had to face each other talk in person which actually helped us to articulate ourselves and learn how to apologise and accept wrong doings.

'We were all a family and brothers and sisters, argue like cat and dog but always make up. That's what it was like with us.' 

Money, money, money: Holly also revealed the huge pay difference between male and female cast members when they were booked for personal appearances

Original: When asked if the producers tried to persuade Holly to stay, she replied: 'God yes!'

When asked if she took drugs to cope with the endless night outs, Holly said:  'We obviously would never be allowed drugs on the show we would be sacked instantly.' 

Holly also revealed the huge pay difference between male and female cast members when they were booked for personal appearances. 

She claimed clubs would book the original boys such as Gary Beadle for £1,000 plus while she would only be paid £250 for the same job. 

Audition: Holly also shared what producers asked when interviewing potential cast members for the show

When asked if the producers tried to persuade Holly to stay, she replied: 'God yes! 

'They tried so hard to get me to stay and I imagine the same happened with everyone else. I said I wanted to leave at the spur of the moment.

'I left because Kyle was told to leave and I was sick of fighting for him to be back on the show. I felt like I was being treated so unfairly but looking back now those producers were trying to desperately to get me away from him so I could be better. 

'I'd lost so much of myself and I couldn't see it but they were looking from the outside in. 

'I don't for one second regret leaving though. I needed to sort my life out off camera and find myself again.' 

Holly made her first appearance on MTV hit reality TV show Geordie Shore on the first episode of Series one making her one of the original cast members. 

During her time on the show she embarked on relationships with other cast members such as James Tindale, Scott Timlin and Kyle Christie. 

After making 111 appearances, Holly left the show in the Series 13 finale which aired on 20, December 2016.
