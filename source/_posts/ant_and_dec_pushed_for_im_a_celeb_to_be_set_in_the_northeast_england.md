Ant and Dec 'pushed for I'm A Celeb to be set in the north-east of England' where they are both from before producers decided on a Welsh castle. 

The TV duo, who both hail from Newcastle, reportedly wanted the ITV show to be based there when filming moved to the UK from Australia in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 

The friends, both 44, have lived in London for over 20 years, but told The Sun that they they 'pitched a lot of castles' including Lindisfarne Castle off the north-east coast on Holy Island.

Another location that was suggested was Warkworth Castle - which is situated just 29 miles from their home town.

Admitting they were excited at the prospect of being closer to family, Dec revealed: 'I said we should put them all on Holy Island, let's all go to Lindisfarne (castle), get them all there.'

Ant added: 'You've got Warkworth castle, we pitched a lot of castles – we tried.' 

New location: Despite this the producers announced earlier this summer that this year's series will be filmed at Gwrych Castle, in Abergele

Friends: Their revelation comes after Dec shared a funny video to his Instagram of him nearly falling asleep after Ant's long winded explanation during a radio interview on Friday

Their revelation comes after Dec shared a funny video to his Instagram of him nearly falling asleep after Ant gave a long-winded explanation to a question during a radio interview on Friday.

In the footage, Ant is talking about the pair's special friendship while Dec makes funny faces at the camera and yawns.

I'm A Celebrity bosses have reportedly forked out millions to make the 19th-century castle where this year's series is being held in North Wales safe.

It has apparently been a costly affair to transform the castle into a TV set, as workers installed electrics and pipes to provide the location with running water. 

According to the Sun, the star-studded line-up of campmates will be housed under a waterproof roof in a show first to protect them from the bitter UK climate.

A show source said: 'This isn't a holiday camp for the stars, but without a roof, everyone would have been utterly miserable for three weeks, which would not make great telly.

'It will still be hard work but slightly warmer than if it snows where they are sleeping. ITV want viewers to largely recognise the show.' 

In pictures obtained by the publication, a studio where hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly has been erected, as well as an uncovered area where contestants will be allowed to light a camp fire.

Changes: This year's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here will be filmed at Gwrych Castle in North Wales, after being forced to relocate due to the COVID-19 pandemic

A section of the location where they will sleep has been covered with strong plastic to keep the winds and rain at bay.

MailOnline have contacted I'm A Celebrity for comment. 

Last month Kevin Lygo, the Director of Television at ITV, has revealed that all stars for this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! have been confirmed. 

And while rumours circulate that Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn, presenter Vernon Kay, and Coronation Street's Beverley Callard have signed up, Lygo assures all of the as-yet-unnamed stars have been confirmed – despite the change of location.
