Joseph O’Brien has already secured victories in some of world racing’s marquee events in a burgeoning training career and GALILEO CHROME (Doncaster, 3.35) can create history in Saturday’s Pertemps St Leger.

No one has won the last Classic of the Flat season as a rider and trainer since Harry Wragg managed it when saddling Intermezzo in 1969, 26 years after riding Herringbone to success for Walter Earl.

O’Brien bids to achieve the feat seven years after steering Leading Light to a hard-fought win and, in Galileo Chrome, he looks to have an ideal candidate. His grandfather is Galileo and the Australia colt appears to have the blend of speed and stamina required to lift Britain’s oldest Classic. He is in grand form courtesy of an emphatic five-length win in Listed company at Navan.

Any horse which hits the line strongly at that venue is talented, so the fact Galileo Chrome did that following a slick change of gear was all the more impressive.

A good day’s action also features the Irish Champion Stakes. in which the presence of the world’s highest-rated Flat horse GHAIYYATH (Leopardstown, 4.10) illuminates the card. He has beaten both main rivals, Magical and Japan, with a degree of comfort this season and would need to under perform significantly to be beaten.
