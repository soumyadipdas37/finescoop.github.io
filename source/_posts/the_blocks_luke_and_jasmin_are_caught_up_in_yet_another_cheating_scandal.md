The Block's Luke and Jasmin found themselves at the centre of yet another cheating scandal in a teaser trailer for Sunday's upcoming episode.

After fellow contestants Daniel and Jade, 34, enlisted furniture designer Christian Cole to create a bespoke kitchen island bench for them, Luke and Jasmin copied the design.

Foreman Keith Schleiger pointed out the similarities between the two teams' island benches, and made no secret of the fact Luke and Jasmin, 36, had tried to recreate Daniel and Jade's one-of-a-kind design.

'Christian Cole came along, put this in, and then it's weird how the next day...' he said trailing off as he compared the two benches.

Luke and Jasmin's builder admitted their island bench had been a last minute addition, describing it as 'a midnight effort'.

'Yeah, he's my mini Christian Cole!' laughed Luke, 35, before an equally amused Jasmin came in and joined her husband.

But Daniel, 35, definitely wasn't laughing, and confessed he was worried he'd shown the other teams his unique island bench 'a bit too early'. 

'I'll let the public decide at home,' a stony-faced Daniel added amid claims Luke and Jasmin had blatantly ripped off his design.

On Tuesday's episode, Luke and Jasmin were accused of cheating on their winning kids' room by judge Shaynna Blaze.

'It felt familiar, and then I found this,' the 57-year-old interior designer said, before pulling up a series of comparison photos on a tablet.  

Luke and Jasmin's idea for their kids' bedroom had completely come from the pages of interior design magazine, Inside Out, with Shaynna pointing out all the similarities.

'Spotted wallpaper, bunk, animals, saffron, aztec, grey, white sheer,' she listed, pointing out that 'the only difference' was the chair and how they put it together.

'So, you're calling it inspiration,' continued Shaynna. 'What happens is inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another.'

Shaynna explained that it was one thing for them to copy a design for their own home, but she reminded them that they were in a competition.

'You haven't changed it up enough. It's not fair on the other contestants that they can win a room, with money, on someone else's ideas,' added Shaynna.
