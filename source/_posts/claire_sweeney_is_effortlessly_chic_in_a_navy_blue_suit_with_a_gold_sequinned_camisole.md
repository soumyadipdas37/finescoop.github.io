Scary: It also came after she revealed she had been hospitalised with coronavirus symptoms in December after she experienced 'breathing difficulties'

Claire recently revealed that she had gained 5lb in one week, after 'falling off the wagon' with her diet.

The TV personality shared a clip of herself donning a leopard-print swimsuit as she indulged in a cronut while basking in the sunshine.

Ahead of biting into the sweet pastry, she confessed: 'I've been good for two days. I fell off the wagon last week. Ugh, I gained 5lb. How do you do 5lb in a week? Five pounds! I enjoyed every mouthful, but fri**in' hell.

Hello? Also at the event was Benidorm actor Jake Canuso, as he and Claire awarded an unsung COVID-19 hero with a home makeover

'So I thought, right OK, come on, get your a**e into gear. And I was good Monday, Tuesday, I think it's Wednesday today, and it's gone t*ts up! Oh, me chins!

'I'm sat in a fri**in' deckchair with me belly on me knees, me t*ts on me belly, and a cronut in me hand. And I'm in heaven! I feel like I'm in Majorca. It's bl**dy lovely!'

Claire's candid video came days after she revealed she had been hospitalised with coronavirus symptoms in December after she experienced 'breathing difficulties.'
