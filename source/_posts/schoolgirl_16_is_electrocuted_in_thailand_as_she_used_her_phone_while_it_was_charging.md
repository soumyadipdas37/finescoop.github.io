Despite their best efforts, Thanyaluck could not be revived and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

'I am heartbroken. She loved school and went to her room to do homework every day as soon as she came home,' he said.

Sobbing grandparent Nookrai Phadasri, 65, said she had arrived at the family home on the day in question and had started cooking dinner.

Police Lieutenant Colonel Ning Supavit said: 'The young schoolgirl suffered an electric shock that was so powerful, she could not survive.

'From the initial investigation at the scene, we identified the smartphone as being the cause of death. 

'She was holding it while it was charging and also she had earphones in to listen to something.'
