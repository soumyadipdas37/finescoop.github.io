Joe Wicks has revealed that meditation helped him be 'proud' of his father after he previously saw his heroin addiction as a sign of 'weakness'.

The Body Coach star, 33, has revealed that his dad Gary is now clean after getting help from Narcotics Anonymous. He was in and out of rehab throughout his childhood.

Candid: Joe Wicks has revealed that meditation helped him be 'proud' of his father after he previously saw his heroin addiction as a sign of 'weakness' 

Talking to Headspace founder, Andy Puddicombe, on his Joe Wicks Podcast, he said: 'I did a meditation on letting of negativity and also one on gratitude. 

'I had this amazing feeling. My dad was a really hard heroin addict when I was growing up and a lot of his friends died from overdoses.'

He added: 'When I did this meditation I had these lovely thoughts come to me of "Wow, I'm so proud of my dad and so grateful" because I always saw it as a weakness.

'I thought that as an addict you are a weak person. But he came through that and he survived.

'I burst into tears basically and I rang him up and I had this wonderful conversation with him where I said, "Look I am really proud that you survived that and I am so grateful that you are alive". And I have never had that thought [before].'

And although he's had powerful moments, Joe also admitted that meditation can sometimes leave him feeling 'frustrated'.

He said: 'I have some meditations where I sit down and I am frustrated. I am not enjoying it. I don't get anything out of it and its kind of like a workout.

'Sometimes you really push and you feel great, other times you don't. I have had a couple of really powerful moments [meditating].'

Only recently, Joe revealed he promised himself that drug addiction would not be his 'destiny' after seeing his father Gary struggle from being a heroin addict.

The fitness guru shared he used exercise as a way to 'manage my feelings' as he and his older brother Nikki, 36, had to deal with their father's addiction.

Speaking on Russell Brand's Under The Skin podcast, Joe said: 'Because of my dad's addiction, and the damage I saw that cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. 

'We weren't smoking weed, we were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn't going to be my destiny – that wasn't going to be my path.'

Joe admitted his father was in and out of rehab throughout his youth while he credited his mother Raquela with teaching him and his brother right from wrong. 

The fitness expert, who is known as The Body Coach, now enjoys a great relationship with his father who he said still battles his addictions. 

Joe revealed: 'Now, when my dad's going through a low period, I'm texting him and ringing him and asking how he is – I'm not judging him for being an addict. He'll always be an addict – he relapses all the time.'

The TV star said that now he has matured, he is there for his father and loves him 'just how he is'.  

Joe, who is father to daughter Indie, one, and son Marley, eight months, with his wife Rosie, also encourages his dad to exercise.
