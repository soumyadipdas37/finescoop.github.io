It's not just the amusing script that is being appreciated by fans of the new Netflix comedy The Duchess, but also Katherine Ryan's standout wardrobe - complete with fur-detailed pyjamas, a sequin raincoat and crystal headbands.

Viewers said the outfits featured in the drama - which also include vibrant silver slip-on shoes and numerous knee-high boots - have set a 'new standard for school run attire.'

The show follows a 'disruptive single mother' navigating the ups and downs of parenthood in London - with comedian Katherine's character, who has the same name, sharing a close relationship with her only daughter Olive.

Katherine debates whether to have a second child and looks at getting a sperm donor before suggesting Olive's father - a former musician called Shep (Peaky Blinders' Rory Keenan), who has a dishevelled life 'off the grid' on a barge - help her get pregnant. 

Released this month, the comedy has been praised for its amusing storyline and for its equally 'amazing' costumes, with one viewer writing: 'Fifteen minutes into #TheDuchessNetflix and already obsessed with Katherine Ryan's wardrobe. I need feather-trimmed pyjamas.'

While a fourth wrote: 'Katherine in The Duchess is exactly the kind of mother I want to be. Will be taking my mug on the school run tomorrow in honour of her.'

One viewer said: 'The Duchess is amazeballs! Katherine Ryan is setting a new standard for school run attire! More episodes please!

One person said: 'Absolutely loved The Duchess on Netflix, just gutted I've already finished it. I wanted more.'

Another added: 'Just binge watched Katherine Ryan and The Duchess on Netflix... season two please! Funny. Clever. This woman is on fire!'

A third wrote: 'I expected a very in-your-face comedy and Katherine Ryan provided it. The Duchess TV series on Netflix is very recommended.'

Whilst dealing with a boyfriend who wants to take their relationship to the next level, Katherine has to choose between having a baby with a sperm donor or her estranged partner and Olive's dad.

Katherine is featured in a variety of hilarious and embarrassing situations, including confrontations at the school gates and discussing sex with her boyfriend in front of a delivery driver.

Another hilarious scene in the comedy sees Katherine visit a fertility doctor who questions why she would need to use a sperm donor to which she responds 'all of my family are dead... to me'.

She is then loudly offended when the doctor suggests she use a young man's profile to help with her 'geriatric pregnancy'.

Further into the drama, Katherine is also seen struggling to come to terms with her failed musician ex's new girlfriend insisting on being part of Olive's life.

Not one for being conventional, Katherine also spends time taking her daughter on nights out and to the pub as she tries to raise her as best she can.

The sitcom is loosely based on the comedian's own life as a mother-of-one who raised her daughter Violet, 11, in London, when they moved to the UK from Canada.

Speaking to The Radio Times about the new show in August, Katherine said: 'I've never written a sitcom so that makes it very different (from my previous Netflix specials).

'It was a challenge, because I'm not a screenwriter who's experienced, I don't know the rules, I'm learning the rules.

'The Duchess is super authentic I think to my personality, to my stage persona, because it's a disruptive mum who's a bad person but a good mum.

'She's fashionable, she loves being a mother she's not sad about it — it's me, yes. The rest is fiction, but it is a heightened version of me, and I'm really lucky because they're just letting me go and write the real thing that I would have wanted to.
