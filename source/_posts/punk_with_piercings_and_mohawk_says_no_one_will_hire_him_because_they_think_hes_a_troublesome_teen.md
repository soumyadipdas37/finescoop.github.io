A teenage punk with heavy makeup, tattoos and a mohawk says he is being knocked back for work because of his looks. 

Novak Daniels, 18, has been denied countless jobs and apprenticeships across Queensland's Sunshine Coast in recent months.  

The social media star, known as 'nxvac', posts videos and images of himself decked out in all black and wearing thick makeup.

A teenage punk with heavy makeup, tattoos and a mohawk says he is being knocked back for work because of how he looks

The 18-year-old has some work experience, including a previous stint in an office job and three months working as a barista.

But recent applications for cafe work, mowing lawns and trade work as a boiler maker and welder came up short.

The teenager says whenever he gets to job interviews they won't hire him because of how he looks. 

'I think these people are very old-fashioned and think I'm a troublesome teenager,' he told the Sunshine Coast Daily.

He said it has nothing to do with his work ethic, but rather a stereotype of being a 'punk'.

'I dress the way I dress to express myself. I don't want to fit with the system because it's broken,' he said. 

'I'm being myself, and if people are choosing to discriminate against me and tell me to pull my piercings out, then they can.'

But he said he is a reliable, hard-worker and with a growing number of followers on social media has a good understanding of how to produce viral content.

One of his latest TikTok videos gathered 1.8million views - and he has more than 55,000 subscribers on the video sharing platform.  

He is also hoping to launch his own business where he plans to sell affordable punk clothing kits.
