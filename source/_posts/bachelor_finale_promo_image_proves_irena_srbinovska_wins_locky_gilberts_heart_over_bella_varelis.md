The Bachelor's Irena Srbinovska has been tipped to win Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert's heart since the beginning of the season.  

And Channel 10 appears to have dropped another major hint that the 31-year-old nurse will triumph over her rival Bella Varelis, 25, during this week's grand finale episode.  

On Thursday morning, the network provided a telling detail about the winner's identity by posting an Instagram photo of Irena and Bella posing in their finale dresses. 

The dress theory! The colour of Irena Srbinovska's dress in The Bachelor finale suggests she will be the winner over Bella Vareilis, who is seen wearing a slightly darker gown 

According to a long-standing fan theory, whoever is wearing the lighter coloured dress during the finale will ultimately win the heart of the Bachelor and the show. 

This theory has been proved realiable over the years, with previous stars Chelsie McLeod, Laura Byrne, Alex Nation and Snezana Markoski all finding true love with their respective suitors. 

In this year's promotional image, Irena is pictured wearing a patterned brown dress by designer Con Ilio, while Bella wears a slightly darker coloured plum ballroom gown by Georgia Young Couture.  

Hint: Last year's winner Chelsie McLeod (left) wore a nude form-fitting gown with a plunging neckline, while runner-up Abbie Chatfield (right) wore a much darker, black beaded number.

Clue: Previous winner Laura Byrne (left), wore a much lighter frock than her rival Elise Stacy (right), and ended up in the arms of Matty 'J' Johnson

If history repeats itself, it appears Irena is set to be the last woman standing when the final scenes play out. 



Last year's winner Chelsie McLeod wore a nude form-fitting gown with a plunging neckline, while runner-up Abbie Chatfield wore a much darker, black beaded number. 

Similarly, previous winner Laura Byrne, wore a much lighter frock than her rival Elise Stacy, and ended up in the arms of Matty 'J' Johnson. 

And again! Likewise, winner of Bachelor Richie Strahan's heart, Alex Nation (left), fronted the finale in a light gold dress, while Nikki Gogan (right) wore a vibrant red lace gown 

Colour codes: The trend also traces back to when Snezana Markoski (right) stood before Sam Wood in a white beaded dress when he declared she was 'the one'. Meanwhile, runner-up Lana Jeavons-Fellows (left) wore a darker hue, but only by a shade - a baby blue dress with sheer mesh skirting

The pair are now engaged and expecting their second baby together.  

Likewise, winner of Bachelor Richie Strahan's heart, Alex Nation, fronted the finale in a light gold dress, while Nikki Gogan wore a vibrant red lace gown.

The trend also traces back to when Snezana Markoski stood before Sam Wood in a white beaded dress when he declared she was 'the one'. 

It's all in the frock! Heading over to season two, Sam Frost (right) was in a sequinned silver dress when Blake Garvey proposed to her

Meanwhile, runner-up Lana Jeavons-Fellows wore a darker hue, but only by a shade - a baby blue dress with sheer mesh skirting.

Season two winner Sam Frost wore a sequinned sparkling silver dress when Blake Garvey proposed to her, while runner-up Lisa Hyde donned jet black. 

The theory holds true all the way back to season one, with Tim Robards picking Anna Heinrich, who donned an ivory gown, while Rochelle Emanuel-Smith wore pink. 

The Bachelor finale airs on Network Ten on Thursday at 7.30pm
