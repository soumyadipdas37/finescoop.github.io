Emmerdale star Lisa Riley has bravely admitted that she has accepted that motherhood will not happen for her after years of fertility issues. 

Speaking on Tuesday's Loose Women about her character Mandy Dingle's storyline surrounding her fertility, the soap legend, 44, confessed that the script had resonated with her and she has faced up to not becoming a mother. 

In the chat, Lisa said: 'I’ve openly discussed that I’ve had trouble to conceive and I’ve took ownership that it’s never going to happen for me and that’s fine.'

Lisa's character Mandy had a miscarriage during one storyline earlier this year, which left her unable to have her own biological children. 

Last week, Lisa spoke to Digital Spy, where she opened up about her struggles with infertility and how she was told by medical experts that it is unlikely she will ever conceive, even via IVF due to the poor quality of her eggs.

She insisted that although she feels people treat her 'differently' after the rounds of IVF failed, she feels 'happy' in her personal life due to her close relationship with her nieces and nephews.

Speaking again about the issue on Tuesday, Lisa, who has been engaged to musician Al since 2018, detailed how she reacts when asked if she will adopt.

Tough realisation: In her profession, Lisa said: 'I’ve openly discussed that I’ve had trouble to conceive and I’ve took ownership that it’s never going to happen for me and that’s fine'

She said: 'It’s really hard, you go, we’re OK. Whatever reasons you have, you speak about it as a couple. I feel people sometimes need to have more awareness... 

'If people say, we don’t have children, you just put a full stop there and say, oh OK.'

On Mandy's struggles, she went on: 'Infertility is not tackled in soap opera and it really should be. I had done a bit of research on infertility but the volume of girls [messaging me] who were 21, 27, so young...

'They felt they could open up to me. They said, I feel incomplete, I don’t feel like a woman. Thank you to Emmerdale that we are bringing this story to the forefront.'

On tying the knot amid ever-changing rules surrounding the pandemic, she said: 'I openly said lockdown was a time when, if you’re together all those months and don’t kill each other, that’s the one you’re meant to be with...

'We keep laughing at all the new rules. First it was 30 guests, then 15. The idea of just 15 guests, simple, cheap and cheerful with the one you love. That’s m

This time last year Lisa said she refused to dwell on the fact she is unlikely to become a mum after she tried for a baby with IVF following her 12 stone weight loss, but was left devastated when doctors delivered the news she was unlikely to get pregnant.

She told The Mirror: 'It is just not meant to be. Since being back at Emmerdale I have heard so many positive stories about people who tried IVF and it didn't work, but then fell pregnant naturally.

'I wouldn't go down the IVF route now but I will let nature take its course and, if I did fall pregnant, I would be thrilled. But I am not going to dwell on it, no one is going to give me bad news again.'
