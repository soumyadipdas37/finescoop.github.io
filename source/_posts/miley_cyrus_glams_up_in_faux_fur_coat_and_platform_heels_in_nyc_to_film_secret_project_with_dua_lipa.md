Grammy nominee Miley Cyrus glammed up in a faux tiger fur coat, fishnets, and patent leather platform heels in Manhattan on Wednesday to film a secret project with two-time Grammy winner Dua Lipa.

Meanwhile, Dua snuck out of her trailer for a smoke on set while wearing full make-up, hair extensions, a white robe, and black heels.
