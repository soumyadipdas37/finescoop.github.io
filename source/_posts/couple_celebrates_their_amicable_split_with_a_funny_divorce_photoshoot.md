Engagement photoshoots, maternity photoshoots, and newborn photoshoots have all been done before, but an Oklahoma may be starting a new trend with their divorce photoshoot.

When Shalena Casanova and her ex-husband split, they celebrated the conscious uncoupling with some funny professional picture.

In the images, the couple stage a mock divorce proposal, and also wear smiles on their faces as they pretend to put their old wedding gown and tux for sale.

They don't! When Shalena Casanova and her ex-husband split, they celebrated the conscious uncoupling with a divorce photoshoot

Shalena and her ex clearly have a good sense of humor about the unfortunate situation, and seem to be splitting up on relatively good terms.

In one photo that she posted on Facebook, the redhead is down on one knee with a chalkboard sign reading, 'Will you divorce me?'

Her ex holds a matching sign with an enthusiastic 'yes!'

In another picture, Shalena holds up her bridal gown, while her ex — sporting a T-shirt and baseball cap, has a tuxedo jacket slung over his shoulder.

'For sale,' reads their sign. 'Tux & wedding dress. Worn by mistake.'  

Viral: In the Facebook caption, which Shalena said: 'We are by no means condoning divorce; however, we are not ashamed to celebrate the end of our marriage'

The third image shows them holding signs that say 'I want a divorce now' and 'I wanted a divorce yesterday.'

In the Facebook caption, which Shalena has now set to private, she wrote called it 'the "oh well so shameful" deed.'

'We are by no means condoning divorce; however, we are not ashamed to celebrate the end of our marriage,' she said, according to Fox 23.  

'We choose to co-parent successfully. We choose to separate FOR the kids and not believe the lie that staying together for the sake of the kids is what is best for them.

'We love fully when we are our best selves,' she said.

'We choose to co-parent successfully. We choose to separate FOR the kids and not believe the lie that staying together for the sake of the kids is what is best for them,' she said

The ex-couple's photoshoot is not the first to celebrate a divorce, though it is unique in that it stars both the ex-husband and wife.

Divorce photoshoots have shown some popularity for newly-single women, who use them to celebrate being rid of an ex.

Some photograph themselves destroying old photos, while a few go so far as to set their bridal gowns on fire.
