Uzo Aduba made a statement at this year's Emmy Awards as she honoured Breonna Taylor, who was shot dead by Louisville Metro Police Department as they served a no-knock warrant at her home in March.

The screen star, 39, sported a T-shirt emblazoned with the emergency medical technician's name as she scooped the Supporting Actress in Limited Series or Movie for her portrayal as Shirley Chisholm in historical drama Mrs. America.

Speaking from her home during the virtual ceremony, the thespian said: 'I want to say thank you for Shirley Chisholm for her championship work for all people who have been forgotten, marginalized, who she represented.'

The media personality teamed her powerful item of clothing with metallic bottoms and hooped earrings, while her braided locks were swept into a bun.  

On playing the first African-American woman elected to the United States Congress, the Orange Is The New Black star told PEOPLE: 'It means a lot, particularly for the character that I was able and fortunate enough to play. 

'Shirley Chisholm was a trailblazer and a champion for those who had been forgotten and left behind, and those who had no voice where they should. It feels especially touching to bring her story to light, and the stories of those who have not been heard.'

The TV and film star added that her character helped her highlight Breonna's story through her outfit as she added: 'It felt like, in this time, I didn't want to leave what's happening outside. I want to bring the world in and represent and speak for those who have been forgotten.'

The ceremony was presented by Jimmy Kimmel at Los Angeles' Staples Center and didn't feature an audience due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The three officers who fired their weapons during the night of Breonna's death have been at the centre of consistent public backlash, with protesters calling for them to be fired and charged with murder.

One of the officers, Brett Hankison, was fired for 'blindly' firing 10 shots into Taylor's apartment from outside. The other two, John Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, remain on the force on administrative assignment.

Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton, actress Halle Berry and singer Mariah Carey have also worn charity protest T-shirts calling for the 'arrest of the cops who killed her'. 

The Mercedes driver wasn't punished for sporting the 'political' item of clothing during a recent appearance at the Tuscan Grand Prix, where he celebrated his 90th career win. 

The Kentucky Attorney General is still investigating the killing, which has led to riots in America.

On the night of Breonna's death, officers attended her apartment after securing a court-approved warrant as part of a drugs investigation that allowed officers to enter her home without any prior warning.

Warrant: Breonna and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker had been sleeping in bed when the officers served the warrant at around 1am

Breonna and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker had been sleeping in bed when the officers served the warrant at around 1am.

The suspect at the centre of the probe had apparently lived at the same address years earlier and continued to receive packages there.

Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner, had fired a shot in the direction of the doorway, thinking the couple were victims of a home invasion.

The shot struck Sergeant Mattingly in the leg before Officer Hankinson returned fire, discharging his weapon in the direction of Walker 10 times.

Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black emergency medical technician, was fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison, and Myles Cosgrove on March 13, 2020.

Three plainclothes LMPD officers entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, executing a no-knock search warrant (although, according to the police account and witnesses present at the scene, the officers nonetheless knocked before forcing entry).

Gunfire was exchanged between Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker and the officers. Walker said that he believed that the officers were intruders. The LMPD officers fired over twenty shots. Taylor was shot eight times and LMPD Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly was injured by gunfire. Another police officer and an LMPD lieutenant were on the scene when the warrant was executed.

The primary targets of the LMPD investigation were Jamarcus Glover and Adrian Walker, who were suspected of selling controlled substances from a drug house more than 10 miles away. According to a Taylor family attorney, Glover had dated Taylor two years before and continued to have a 'passive friendship'.

The search warrant included Taylor's residence because it was suspected that Glover received packages containing drugs at Taylor's apartment and because a car registered to Taylor had been seen parked on several occasions in front of Glover's house. No drugs were found in the apartment.

Kenneth Walker, who was licensed to carry a firearm, fired first, injuring a law enforcement officer, whereupon police returned fire into the apartment with more than 20 rounds.

A wrongful death lawsuit filed against the police by the Taylor family's attorney alleges that the officers, who entered Taylor's home 'without knocking and without announcing themselves as police officers', opened fire 'with a total disregard for the value of human life'. However, according to the police account, the officers did knock and announce themselves before forcing entry.

A New York Times investigation confirmed from interviews with Kenneth Walker and with Taylor's neighbours that the police had knocked loudly before breaking in, but most had not heard them announce themselves.

Mr Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove also opened fire. Ms Taylor was hit eight times and pronounced dead at the scene.

'Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend,' a frantic Mr Walker told dispatchers in a 911 call.

Unbeknownst to the officers at their home, the suspect they were searching for had been taken into custody hours earlier in a separate location.

Breonna's death received national attention two months later, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police in May.
