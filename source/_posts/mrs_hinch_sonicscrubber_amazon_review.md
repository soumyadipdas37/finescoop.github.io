There are plenty of cleaning tools available on Amazon designed to take the hassle out of your hands, from fast-drying, reusable Mr Siga cleaning cloths to the bestselling Vileda Turbo Microfibre Mop and Bucket Set.

However, there is one standout cleaning gadget that deserves a solo shoutout, the SonicScrubber Power Cleaning Brush. It's a hidden gem when it comes to deep-cleaning your floors, bathroom tiling and even your washing machine.

Not only has the versatile and easy-to-use tool received hundreds of glowing reviews from cleaning fanatics who say the SonicScrubber Power Cleaning Brush is a 'great gadget' and 'works a treat with just the smallest of effort', but it's also Mrs Hinch approved.

In a recent Instagram Story, Mrs Hinch shared with her 3.7m followers her step-by-step guide for removing grime from her washing machine using the SonicScrubber

The Instagram cleaning sensation, aka Sophie Hinchliffe, swears by her SonicScrubber for everything from cleaning her bathroom tiles to plugs and even her washing machine. In short, it's a must-have for getting hard-to-reach areas sparkling.

Once on the round bristle head oscillates 10,000 times per minute, meaning there is no need to buckle down and get scrubbing - it does the hard work for you at the touch of a button. 

The brand claims the tool which works much like a large electric toothbrush cleans 25 times faster than manual scrubbing.

The battery-powered electric cleaning brush comes equipped with four brush heads, each made to tackle varying dirty surfaces, including a medium-size, a large size, a cone-shaped head and a soft cleaning head.

The bristles on each head are soft enough to leave kitchen appliances to grill tops scratch-free but thorough enough to remove the toughest stains and dirt.

'This is a must-have in every household. I brought it because I saw Mrs Hinch using it and I'm so glad I brought it,' wrote one customer. 

'The amount of dirt and grime that you can clean with this is endless. So easy to use and to clean. I loved it so much I brought one for my mother in law!'

Another customer said it's a great cleaning device to use, especially for removing washing machine fabric softener and mildew build-up: 'Perfect for nooks and crannies. Really enjoyed cleaning my washing machine Mrs Hinch style. Made the job dead easy.'

'Excellent product,' said another reviewer. 'I cleaned out my washing machine drawer, and it came out sparkling clean - along with my hobs!'

In a recent Instagram Story, the cleanfluencer shared with her 3.7m followers her step-by-step guide for removing grime from her washing machine using the SonicScrubber.

After taking the drawer out and placing in her sink to soak in Flash spray, Sophie revealed how she uses bicarbonate of soda and white vinegar, along with her trusty SonicScrubber to tackle the more challenging to reach places in the empty compartment. Before finishing with a well-soaked sponge to rinse away any dirt. And it delivered sparkling results.

While Mrs Hinch's tool is priced at £18.99 on Amazon, the online retailer also sell unbranded versions for less than a tenner.
