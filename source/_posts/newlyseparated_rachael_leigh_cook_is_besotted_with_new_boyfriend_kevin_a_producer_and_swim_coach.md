Two months after her husband of nearly 15 years Daniel Gillies filed for divorce, Rachael Leigh Cook is revealing more details about her new mystery boyfriend Kevin, who's a 'fancy' producer and swim coach.

'I kinda do have the heart eye emoji,' the Minnesota-born 40-year-old gushed to ET Canada on Tuesday.

'I'm dating this really nice guy named Kevin and he's a producer and also, get this, a swim coach. He swam in college on a scholarship because he's just sporty like that. So he coaches in season, and he's also this fancy producer guy. He's so smart.'  

Moved on! Two months after her husband of nearly 15 years Daniel Gillies (R) filed for divorce, Rachael Leigh Cook (L) is revealing more details about her new mystery boyfriend Kevin, who's a 'fancy' producer and swim coach (pictured in 2018) 

Turns out Rachael was set up with Kevin through her good friend, Kidding actress Judy Greer.

'I was complaining about some online interactions that I've had and Judy Greer said, "Well, when you're ready to meet someone nice, you should meet Kevin,"' Cook recalled. 

'I told her that I'm sure her friend is great, but that seems like a lot of pressure because they're friends and we're friends and I need to figure out my disaster self for a while.
