It comes after Christine admitted she is having a 'difficult time' as she revealed that her mother has now had a lumpectomy following her breast cancer diagnosis. 

In emotional video message to fans, shared on Instagram last week, the former Real Housewives of Cheshire star explained why she had not been on social media much of late. 

Christine, who is married to Top Gear presenter Paddy McGuinness, said: 'I don’t know where to start. Obviously I’ve been quiet on here and it’s a conscious decision to spend less time on social media whilst I’ve got so much going on personally.

 'Loads of you have asked if I’m OK and I’m just letting you know I am OK. I’m having a difficult time which I’m not going to go into too much because my heart is beating, I'm alive.' 

She continued: 'As you know, my mum was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and that is a whole other situation. Just to update you she is doing really well.

'She had a lumpectomy this week and she’s at home recovering now so we’re just waiting to hear what the next steps are. The doctor wants to make sure it hasn’t spread before he gives her a treatment plan with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.'

At the start of the month, Christine revealed that her beloved mother was recently been diagnosed with breast cancer during a heartbreaking Instagram post.  

The glamour model admitted she had been 'hit hard' by the news, as she detailed her mum's magical bond with her three children, twins Leo and Penelope, seven, and Felicity, four, who she spends almost every weekend with. 

The Liverpool native referred to her mum as her 'best friend' and 'rock', while also admitting that she is a 'proper Scouse Ma'.
