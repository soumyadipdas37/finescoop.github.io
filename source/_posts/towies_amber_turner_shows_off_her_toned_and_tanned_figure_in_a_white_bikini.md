She recently returned from a sun-soaked holiday to Crete with her co-star boyfriend Dan Edgar.

Amber's flaxen locks hung loose, and she accessorised her summer look with a number of gold pendants.

The blonde beauty longingly captioned the snap, 'I know where I’d rather be', following her return to Essex earlier this week.

Amber made the trip with boyfriend and TOWIE co-star Dan Edgar, 30, sharing snaps of the couple as they made the most of the sun-drenched climes.  

The formerly on-off pair have been stronger than ever after spending lockdown together.

The couple rekindled their relationship in May last year after a brief split which saw the Lothario pursue a relationship with his co-star Chloe Sims, 37.

Amber has previously spoken about how Dan has become a 'changed man' since they gave their romance another go.

And on Friday night Amber took to her Instagram story to show things are still going strong post-holiday, as she shared snaps of a night out in London with her love.
