An Australian kitchen appliance tester has debunked the biggest air fryer myths after the cult gadget won the praise of thousands of home cooks.

CHOICE home economist Fiona Mair, who has trialled more than 3,000 kitchen appliances, has weighed in on the latest cooking craze after spending years testing nearly every model on the market.  

Here, she busts the common misconceptions of air fryers - and reveals the three surprising meals she'll never cook in the popular kitchen gadget.

MYTH ONE: AIR FRYERS 'FRY' FOOD 

Despite its name, Fiona explained that air fryers actually bake, not 'fry'.

'The biggest misconception is that air fryers cook foods the same as deep frying... They cook as an oven would, so foods are more oven baked than deep fried,' she said.

Just like a fan-forced oven, air fryers are a small 'bulky' benchtop appliance that circulates hot, dry air to produce crispy, golden food with little to no oil.

So why did the air fryers get its name?

'It's just smart marketing to make people think they can get the same results as deep frying without all the oil used, but that's not the case,' she said.

In short, Fiona said air fryers essentially does the same thing a traditional oven can already do but there are a few key differences.

She pointed out the benchtop product has faster heat transfer capabilities than most ovens so it cooks meals in a short amount of time. 

MYTH TWO: AIR FRYERS MAKE FOOD 'HEALTHY' 

Air fryers have been touted as a healthy alternative to cooking 'deep fried' foods such as crispy potato chips or crumbed chicken, without the fat.

Dedicated air fryer fans have cooked everything from pork belly with crackling, roast potatoes and crispy chicken to banana bread and cakes. 

But Fiona pointed out while the product helps reduce your fat intake, you still need to rethink your food choices and portion sizes to ensure it's healthy.

'Avoid frozen prepackaged foods such as chips and chicken nuggets, as they've been pre-cooked in oil,' she said.

Instead, she suggested cooking healthier options in the appliance like homemade vegetable chips, complex carbohydrates and lean proteins.

MYTH THREE: AIR FRYERS ARE JUST FOR JUNK FOOD 

While many assume air fryers are designed for cooking chips, chicken nuggets and 'deep fried' foods, Fiona said the versatile appliance can roast, grill, bake and even reheat healthy meals just like a traditional oven.

She suggested cooking salmon, vegetable chips, homemade vegetable chips, crispy chickpeas and even crispy tofu.

However, Fiona warned there are popular meals she'll avoid cooking in the air fryer.

'I'd avoid cooking cakes, pizza and pies in your air fryer. Because these appliances have a constant top element and no base element, foods will not cook evenly,' she said.
