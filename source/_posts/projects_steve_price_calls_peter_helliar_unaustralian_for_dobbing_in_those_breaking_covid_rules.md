Peter Helliar has been branded 'un-Australian' by his fellow panellist Steve Price on The Project amid a heated debate about Melbourne's strict lockdown rules.

The commentators on Monday night were discussing if it was fair that Victorians can now be fined $5,000 for having more than five people gather for a barbecue.

Price asked the panelists whether they would dob in their neighbours to police if they spotted them breaching COVID-19 restrictions, to which Helliar immediately said he would.

'Ten parties (in Melbourne) over the weekend; one of them had 40 people. Now, 40's obviously over the top, but would you dob in someone who had half a dozen people over at their house for a barbecue?' Price said. 

'I wouldn't think twice about it,' Helliar responded.

The pair then argued about the subject while co-hosts Carrie Bickmore and Waleed Aly tried to lighten the conversation.

'Really? You're a dobber? You're a dobber. It's unAustralian, Peter,' Price said. 

'Mate, I don't care. That's bulls**t,' Helliar hit back.

'You can say it again if you want – I'll say the same thing.

Steve Price labelled fellow The Project panellist Peter Helliar as 'un-Australian' when he said he'd dob in neighbours if he saw them breaching coronavirus restrictions

Helliar said he 'didn't care' what Price called him and said people thinking it was ok to break the rules were 'ridiculous'

'Haven't you been paying attention to what we've all been going through? We're so close to the end. The fact that 40 people are like-minded enough to think that it's OK to have a party is ridiculous.'

 Aly then asked Price if he was planning on throwing his own illegal gathering to which the panellist joked he would.

'Yes...yes I am,' Price said.

'Let me be clear I'm not encouraging people to break the law. I'm saying, don't dob them in!'

Bickmore quickly moved onto the next segment but many viewers took to Twitter to call out Price on his strong ideas.

The strict Melbourne curfew was lifted for the first time in eight weeks on Monday and outdoor gatherings were increased to five people from two households maximum (pictured police patrol though shopping centre in Chadstone, Melbourne)

'Next time just pull the plug out on Steve Price's monitor would ya. You'd get a standing ovation from every living room in the nation,' one person tweeted.

'Doesn't Steve Price realise the whole reason Victoria is in lockdown is because people weren't doing the right thing! Their actions are 'unAustralian'!' another said.

'I'm with pete, businesses are shut and w@nkers have parties?' tweeted someone.

Price's views come after he revealed Melbourne's lockdown prevented him seeing his elderly mother.

'My mother is in her late 80s - I’ve seen her once this year,' he said during an episode in August.

Victoria recorded ten new infections on Tuesday (pictured couple eat in a park while police patrol the area in Melbourne)

'Now she’s in the zone where anything could happen and I just feel gutted that I might not - never - physically see her again.

'It’s awful.'

Bickmore tried to console the 65-year-old, telling him to have hope that Victoria would get on top of the coronavirus outbreak, before Aly chimed in.

'There's every chance you'll see your mum in the not-too-distant future,' Aly said.

'I hope so, because it just breaks my heart,' he said gravely, looking down.

Victoria recorded ten new infections on Tuesday after some restrictions were eased.

The strict curfew was lifted for the first time in eight weeks on Monday and outdoor gatherings were increased to five people from two households maximum.
