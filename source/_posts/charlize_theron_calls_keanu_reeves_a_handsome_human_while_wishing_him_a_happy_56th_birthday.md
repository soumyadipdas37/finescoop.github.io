One fan even took the opportunity to ask when both of the action stars would collaborate together in an Atomic Blonde/John Wick crossover.

Theron starred in the 2017 action-thriller Atomic Blonde, which was directed by David Leitch, who directed the first John Wick movie starring Keanu Reeves, alongside Chad Stahelski.

There has been an Atomic Blonde sequel in the works for the past few years, while Reeves has starred in two John Wick sequels, with another on the way.

'Wishing this handsome devil a happy birthday today. Imagine my surprise when my friends had to think outside of the box for my 50th this year because our plans changed due to the pandemic . Let’s just say #KeanuReeves made my big day very special. #OneOfAKind,' Spencer said.

While Spencer hasn't worked with Reeves before, she shared in a 2014 interview on The Meredith Viera Show that Reeves gave her a hand when her car broke down.
