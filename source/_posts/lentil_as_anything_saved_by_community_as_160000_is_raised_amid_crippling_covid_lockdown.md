A 'community focused' restaurant which has a 'pay what you can' philosophy to ensure people from all walks of life have a hot meal has been struggling to stay afloat due to the pandemic and Victoria's crippling lockdown. 

Lentil As Anything first opened its doors 20 years ago and has serviced the most down-and-out members of society in both Victoria and New South Wales ever since.

Patrons are encouraged to pay what they can afford for a meal and the restaurant is a haven for homeless people.

But after nine months of uncertainty and lockdowns which reduced their income by about 90 per cent, the business found itself on the brink of foreclosure.

Last Friday, a GoFundMe page was set up to help the community business raise $150,000 to pay off mounting debts.

In just four days, 3,800 people who have been touched by the restaurant's generosity rallied together to raise $163,000.

Lentil As Anything media manager Charith Senanayake told Daily Mail Australia he was amazed by the support of the community, but admitted he wasn't surprised.

'We knew that the community would dig deep to help feed Melbourne and Sydney, but we also understand that people are hurting right now,' he explained. 

'We are over the moon... The support gives us the validation to look forward at how we can keep helping people with no access to food.'

Due to the overwhelming support, Lentil As Anything raised their goal to $300,000 and will spend any additional funds in keeping the business running for as long as possible. 

In the last six months alone, the Sydney and St Kilda based restaurants have offered free hot meals to more than 130,000 through various food relief projects

'Today, in the midst of a global pandemic and serious financial difficulty, the generosity of Lentil As Anything has not waivered,' the fundraising page read.

In the last six months alone, the Sydney and St Kilda based restaurants have offered free hot meals to more than 130,000 through various food relief projects.

'We refuse to step away from our pay-as-you-feel concept that defines us. However, along with serious monetary shortfalls and large historic debt, we cannot keep up.

'COVID-19 has changed the world, and we know that many organisations and individuals are struggling.

'Lentil As Anything is on the precipice of permanent closure, right when the community needs us most. And when the world needs examples of hope, perseverance, and kindness.'

Three of the four Lentil as Anything restaurants have been closed for months due to Victoria's Stage Four lockdown to stem the spread of COVID-19, including the original St Kilda store. 

They are among thousands of businesses struggling to keep afloat during the pandemic.

While a roadmap out of lockdown offers a glimmer of hope to businesses that an end is in sight, many frustrated restaurateurs and retail owners say it is 'too little, too late'.

'Some of our businesses haven't made revenue since the first lockdown,' Chrissie Maus, general manager of Chapel Street Precinct Association, said.

'They have been on borrowed time. It's black and white now, the cure is much worse than the cold.

'I'm now most concerned about the long term damage to our business owners mental health and our communities well-being.'

Both the public and officials have been begging for Premier Daniel Andrews to reconsider the tough lockdown for weeks as case numbers taper off and the state appears to get the virus back under control. 

Liberal MP James Newbury said Mr Andrews should make plans to relax restrictions sooner to boost jobs and save businesses.

'Daniel Andrews refuses to offer Victorians hope,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Instead of rewarding Melburnians for low case numbers, he is keeping the community locked up and under curfew. 

For the last six months, the restaurant has been operating to service the most vulnerable members of the community, who have nowhere else to turn

'His restrictions are smashing up businesses, jobs, and livelihoods.'

Melbourne residents have been confined to their homes since July 8 in a lockdown due to last four weeks longer than then shutdown of Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus was identified. 

Owner Shanaka Fernando said keeping the business alive benefits the entire community as it grapples with the consequences of the lockdown.

'As we begin to emerge from lockdown, the community will need us to be there, not only to fill our bellies, but fill our hearts, and we at Lentil need the community's support just as much,' he said.

For the last six months, the restaurant has been operating to service the most vulnerable members of the community, who have nowhere else to turn.

As a result, they've struggled to generate any income but still have outgoing expenses like rent and utilitises, as well as pre-COVID debts with suppliers.  

Mr Fernando was inspired to start the restaurant chain to support his local community and invoke a sense of connection and belonging.

To keep the concept viable, he created the pay-as-you-feel system, which allows patrons to pay for their meal in cash or through a gift of labour or skill. 

'The new concept operates purely on trust and generosity and endorses inclusion and social fairness,' a spokesman explained.
