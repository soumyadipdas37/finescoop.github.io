Con artists are pretending to be government COVID-19 tracers in an elaborate new text message scam.

Fake SMS messages warn innocent Australians that a possible coronavirus case has been detected in their neighbourhood.

The alert then asks victims to click on a link on a map to find out 'the most dangerous places to avoid tomorrow'.

Scamwatch, which is run by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, posted the message on Twitter with warning to all recipients.

'Beware of the latest COVID-19 themed government impersonation scam,' Scamwatch wrote.

Don’t click on hyperlinks in text/social media messages or emails, even if it appears to come from a trusted source.

Go directly to the website through your browser. For example, to reach the MyGov website type ‘my.gov.au’ into your browser yourself.

Never respond to unsolicited messages and calls that ask for personal or financial details, even if they claim to be a from a reputable organisation or government authority - just press delete or hang up.

'If you receive this text, don't click the link, just delete it.'

The watchdog also urged people who are unsure whether a message is legitimate to to contact the relevant agency.

According to scamwatch, fraudsters have collected more than $3.3million from Australians who have fallen victim to scams since the outbreak of COVID-19.  

'Scammers are hoping that you have let your guard down,' Scamwatch said on its website.

'Do not provide your personal, banking or superannuation details to strangers who have approached you.'   

A new tax office scam was also found on Wednesday to be targeting people in the form of a phone voicemail message or SMS.

The ploy urges people to hand over their credit card details - threatening taxpayers with arrest if they don't comply.

'Attention: this call is from the legal department of Services Australia,' the message says.

'Your Tax File Identification Number has been suspended and we have filed a case under your name. 

'So, before this matter goes to Federal Court and you could get arrested kindly press 1. I repeat press 1 to know about your legal case.' 

A spokesperson from the Australian Tax Office said the body is concerned about the increasing number of people paying fake tax debt scammers.

'Scammers pretending to be from the ATO are contacting members of the community, telling them that they have a tax debt and that if they don't pay it straight away they will be arrested,' they said.

'These scammers will often request payment through unusual methods, such as cryptocurrency, pre-paid credit cards or gift cards, and will try to keep people on the line until they have paid.'

They urged anyone who received a phone call, text message or voicemail demanding money not to send a payment or provide personal information.  

'We will never threaten you with immediate arrest or demand payment through unusual means.'
