Frank Lampard believes the club's £22million move for Rennes' goalkeeper Edouard Mendy is on the verge of completion.

The Chelsea boss has been trying to bring in a new shot-stopper all summer and looks to finally have his man.

Manchester United are trying to drive down Porto's £17million price for left back Alex Telles.

The 27-year-old is out of contract next summer and the clubs remain apart in valuation. United are awaiting a revised bid from Roma for defender Chris Smalling who has made it clear he wishes to leave. United rejected the last offer of around £12m.

And welcome to Sportsmail's live transfer blog, as the window sets to wind down to a conclusion in the coming weeks!
