'Dinner for 2,' Kanye captioned his photo, while adding an emoji of a dove carrying an olive branch, possibly to signal he was taking steps to rekindle their romance following his travels without the family and his efforts to run a doomed presidential campaign.

Kim later retweet her husband's post, captioning it with two dove emojis. 

The Monster rapper's photo showed their car outside of a tent building at night, with a small table featuring two chairs arranged just outside by the vehicle.

He didn't make clear what the building or another tent-like structure next to it were supposed to be, but a round entranceway revealed the interior was painted a shade of royal blue and showed an upright piano, possible to serenade his wife with.
