Holly Willoughby shared an amusing post as her youngest child Chester, five, lost his first tooth.

The This Morning presenter, 39, shared the emotional letter her little one had written to the tooth fairy, after he'd accidentally lost his tooth in the grass.

Posting a picture of the note via Instagram on Friday, Chester wrote: 'To tooth fairy, I love my tooth today in the grass. Please can you still come. Love Chester.'

Holly joked in response: 'Slight panic when Chester lost his first tooth today and could[n't] find it... I’m sure the tooth fairy will still come... [sic].'

As well as writing the note, Chester also drew a number of hearts as well as what appeared to be a tooth. 

Holly shares Chester, son Harry, 11, and daughter Belle, nine, with her husband Dan Baldwin, who she has been married to for 13 years.

Her post comes after Holly lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections.

Talking on This Morning she asked whether she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, or father Terry, on Christmas due to having a family of five.  

On Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'.

Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. 

Holly has three children - Harry, 11, Belle, nine, and Chester, five, with husband Dan Baldwin meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'. 

Discussing the new restrictions with Matthew Wright on This Morning, the ITV star said: 'A lot of people are thinking, "What will this mean for Christmas? What will Christmas look like?"

'It's going to be very awkward in my house as I'm a family-of-five, so I'll have to choose between my mum and dad on Christmas day!'  

To which Matthew, 55, replied: 'I'm feeling very confused and conflicted. The rules are different everywhere else in the United Kingdom. 

'You can't have your parents over on Christmas Day but you can go on public transport? For the life of me, I can't make any sense of it.'

With Holly adding: 'I guess the other thought is how is anyone going to police these rules. The government are going to have marshals to monitor people.'
