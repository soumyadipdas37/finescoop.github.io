Danish toy brand Lego has teamed up with Levi's Denim to launch a capsule fashion collection where pieces of plastic Lego are sewn directly onto items of clothes.

The collection, called Wearable Art, is the first of its kind, as it allows you to build your own design onto a denim jacket, hoodie, sweatshirt and other items of clothing, meaning you end up with a unique one-of-a-kind piece.

Launching on October 1, the fashion line is already proving popular with fashionistas and lovers of Lego past and present.

'I plan on sporting this entire line,' one eager shopper wrote of the collection.

'I need these in my life,' another person added.

Almost every piece in the collection - from hoodies to bum bags - is customisable with little pieces of Lego.

The collaboration features the first-ever flexible Lego baseplate, which is a pliable Lego silicone panel onto which fans can create their own customised designs using Lego dots.

The collection isn't just sweatshirts, hoodies and denim jackets and jeans, as it also contains bum bags (pictured) and hats

'This is such a fun collaboration celebrating self-expression, creativity and nostalgia,' Chief Product Officer for Levi Strauss & Co Karyn Hillman told FEMAIL. 

'It's Levi's and the Lego Group coming together to co-create something really special and new, but undeniably familiar.

'With the customisable baseplates, Levi's is now literally a new blank canvas for Lego play.' 

In addition to the sweatshirts, hoodies and jackets, the collection also includes bags, hats, and even a cargo vest.

All of them feature fun Lego-inspired details like colourful buttons and a bright-red Lego patch swapped in instead of Levi's traditional leather version.

The limited edition line will be available in selected Levi's stores across Australia and New Zealand and online from October 1.

This isn't the first time Lego has teamed up with a fashion or homewares brand.

In the past, the iconic toy brand has collaborated with both IKEA and Adidas. 

Lego Adidas sneakers were especially popular with shoppers, which featured the original Lego logo as well as some Lego blocks on the lace tags.
