The PFA Team of the Year has been announced and unsurprisingly it has been dominated by Liverpool who have five inclusions in the squad.  

Jurgen Klopp's side won their first top-flight title in 30 years as they racked up a mammoth 99 points - 18 more than closest challengers Manchester City.

Football Writer's Player of the Year Jordan Henderson added another achievement after his fantastic season by making the team for the first time in his career.

Virgil Van Dijk is one of five Liverpool players to be included in the PFA Team of the Year

His team-mates Sadio Mane, Andrew Robertson, Virgil Van Dijk and PFA Young Player of the Year Trent Alexander-Arnold, all made the team for the second season in a row.

Manchester City had two inclusions in the squad including the newly crowned PFA Player of the Year Kevin De Bruyne.

Also making the team from Pep Guardiola's side was David Silva, who left the club during the summer after a legendary ten-year spell at the club where he won four Premier League titles.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made the team after scoring 22 goals for Arsenal last season

Leicester City also had two involvements after an impressive season - despite missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day.

Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy makes the team up-front along with Caglar Soyuncu who impressed after stepping into the Foxes team in place of Harry Maguire.

England and Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope beat competition from Alison Becker, Ederson and Dean Henderson to make the team after an impressive season for Sean Dyche's side.

The final inclusion was Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who scored 22 goals last season. 

Full PFA Team of the Year - Nick Pope (Burnley), Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil Van Dijk (both Liverpool), Caglar Soyuncu (Leicester), Andrew Robertson (Liverpool), David Silva (Manchester City), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Jamie Vardy (Leicester), Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal), Sadio Mane (Liverpool).
