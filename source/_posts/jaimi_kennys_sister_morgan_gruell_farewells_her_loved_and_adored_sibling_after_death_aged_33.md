Morgan Gruelll has paid tribute to her older sister Jaimi Kenny after laying her to rest at a Sunshine Coast funeral over the weekend. 

In a gut-wrenching Instagram post on Sunday, devastated Morgan spoke of how Jaimi, who died aged 33 last Monday, saw the beauty in everyone and everything, calling her the 'most sentimental person she has ever known'. 

'I will always remember her taking the time to stop and take a photo of a pretty flower, an interesting door, or her feet standing next to crunchy leaves that had fallen from the trees,' she wrote next to a recent photo of the pair posing together.

'I promise to always appreciate these things as she did,' Morgan continued. 

'You were surrounded by SO much love and beauty. Fairy lights everywhere, flowers everywhere, love everywhere. It was a service fitted for the queen of all things pretty, you would have loved it. We will continue to miss and love you always.' 

Morgan went on to thanks the public for 'all the messages of love and support that have been pouring in over the past week.' 

Final farewell: Lisa and Grant farewelled Jaimi on Saturday September 19 in a moving service on the Sunshine Coast, following her death aged 33 last Monday 

'It means the world to us to know how very loved and adored she was by all who met her,' she concluded. 

Jaimi died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital last Monday surrounded by her family, following a years-long battle with an eating disorder and alcoholism. 

She was buried at a 100-person funeral at Sunshine Coast Chapel on Saturday, which was attended by Jaimi's Olympian mother Lisa Curry, athlete father Grant Kenny, and brother Jett Kenny. 

Beautiful: 'It was a service fitted for the queen of all things pretty, you would have loved it', Morgan (R) wrote of her sister's (L) funeral

Lisa's new husband Mark Tabone was also seen comforting a distraught Lisa as Jaimi's white coffin, covered in pink and orange dahlias and baby's breath, was carried out of the chapel and placed in the back of a hearse. 

Elsewhere, Jaimi's younger sister Morgan, who is pregnant, attended the church ceremony with her husband Ryan and their two-year-old son Flynn.  

On Sunday, Lisa shared a heartbreaking tribute to Instagram after farewelling her eldest child forever.

'Yesterday, as the sun was setting, we said goodbye to you, our Jaimi,' Curry wrote of the funeral. 

'As the last sun rays filtered through the trees onto you, fairy lights flickering everywhere around, with the most divine flowers surrounding you, and a room full of unconditional love, we farewelled you... always our bubba.

'It was just perfect... beautiful, quiet, pretty and sparkly... just the way you would have wanted it.'

Lisa alluded to her daughter's heartbreaking battle with the demons that led to her death - that at least now they would haunt her no more.

'Our little angel, you can now rest peacefully. Free of pain, free to flourish and free to grow, free to just be,' she wrote.

'Jaimi, as dad and I lovingly held you when you took your first breath, we lovingly held you as you took your last. Goodnight sweet girl... we hope you have a nice long sleep.'

Jaimi's younger brother Jett penned his own somber tribute on Sunday, reflecting on the good times the close family had with his 'biggest sister'.

'You were there whenever I needed you, you taught me how to cook gourmet food like roast potatoes, chicken and salad, and tacos - the essentials in our household,' he wrote. 

'You gave me a slight insight into fashion by dressing me in up in dresses and putting makeup on me when I was young. You'd sit behind me while I ate dinner and would pick at anything pimple looking on my back - even if it was just a mole.

'You were there whenever I needed you': Jaimi's younger brother Jett (L) penned his own somber tribute on Sunday following the funeral, reflecting on the good times the close family with his 'biggest sister'

'You were my second mother, you were my biggest sister, you were my friend, and you were a fighter until the very end.

'Jaimi, I will love you forever and you will always have a place in my heart. I will miss you dearly, but cherish the moments we had together greatly. I love you so much, and I will see you again at some point.'

Jett also reflected on the funeral, thanking the people who were able to attend and those who couldn't due to Queensland's gathering limit due to coronavirus.

Support: Family and friends of Jaimi were seen embracing each other at the conclusion of the heartbreaking funeral service

On Friday night, Morgan's husband Ryan thanked the local community for their support and outpouring of love in the days since Jaimi's death.   

'Thank you to everyone who has reached out and offered kind words, gifts, support and love to Jaimi's family and I. The condolences are so welcome and helpful,' he wrote alongside a photo with bouquets of flowers.

'We have been sharing the messages with each other and although we may not have been able to offer a response we have received the love from all of it and are very appreciative. 

'Jaimi was so very loved and will be so very missed but the love we all share for her will keep her memory alive.'
