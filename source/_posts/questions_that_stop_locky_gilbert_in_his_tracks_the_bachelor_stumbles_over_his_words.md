Cringe: Things got off to a rocky start for Locky Gilbert as he stumbled over his words following an interrogation by Izzy Sharman-Firth's mum during his hometown visits on The Bachelor

When asked what he thought about feminism, there was a long silence before Locky told cameras: 'I'm on The Bachelor, some people might think that I'm not the best guy to talk about feminism.'

After regaining his composure, Locky finally answered: 'Well, I guess I don't want to do the classic family stuff when the guy goes out to work, and the girl stays home.

'I want to be able to work together, and then go travelling together, and just we're always together.'

Despite eventually answering the questions by Izzy's mother, fans were not amused as they criticised his slow and hesitant response.

One fumed: 'Men, the correct answer to “how do you feel about feminism” is “I’m completely supportive”. It’s not difficult or controversial. #TheBachelorAU.'

Another echoed: Sorry, but why is feminism a hard question? I may be wrong, but to me I think it says a lot about him that he thinks feminism and being on #thebachelorau can’t be conducive?.'

Someone else added: 'No Locky, feminism isn’t a hard thing, it’s either you support gender equality and all the comes with it or you don’t #TheBachelorAU.'

Another enraged viewers gave their input: 'How hard is it for a straight man to just say “yes I believe in equality” when asked “what do you think about feminism”? #TheBachelorAU.'













'Does he know what feminism means?' Viewers were left cringing as Locky struggled to convey an enlightening and educational response when asked what his views on feminism were.

Someone else asked: 'Do we think Locky actually knows what feminism is #TheBachelorAU.'

Meanwhile, Locky was also asked by Izzy's mother what his views on monogamy were. 

Having finally found his stride, Locky responded: 'Marriage to me is very important, as long as we're in love with each other and the feelings are there, that's all I need.'

The adventure junkie also added that he wanted children, much to the delight of Izzy's family.
