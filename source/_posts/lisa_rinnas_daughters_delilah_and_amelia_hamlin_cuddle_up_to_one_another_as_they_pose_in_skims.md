Lisa Rinna's daughters Delilah and Amelia Hamlin cuddled up to one another in SKIMS for Instagram this Tuesday.

Delilah, 22, and Amelia, 19, are the Real Housewife Of Beverly Hill's daughters by her longtime husband Harry Hamlin.

The fashionista sister-act posed for an album on Delilah's Instagram page to plug Kim Kardashian's shapewear line.

Amelia and Delilah have made multiple appearances on social media lately in order to promote the reality TV titan's clothing brand.

Earlier this month Delilah called SKIMS: 'One of the most empowering businesses around that makes me feel comfortable in my own skin!'

Delilah and Amelia went into self-isolation together in Los Angeles earlier this year amid the ongoing coronavirus lockdowns.

However this June Delilah could be spotted in London enjoying a reunion with her boyfriend Eyal Booker of Love Island fame.

Meanwhile Amelia is dating one Mercer Wiederhorn, who is related to Lisa's former Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills co-star Kim Richards.

Mercer's elder brother Thayer Wiederhorn is married to Kim's daughter Brooke, with whom he shares sons Hucksley, two, and Hunter, eight months.

Amelia and Mercer appear to have been an item since at least last April, when she posted a photo of them getting cozy at the Coachella Music Festival.

Both Delilah and Amelia have gone into modeling, and the family have been open about the latter's experience with anorexia. 

Meanwhile Delilah revealed on her Insta Stories this July that she entered rehab twice in 2019 on account of her 'mental health' problems.

'If you suffer from anxiety, or depression, or rather any of the things I've mentioned above, then don't be afraid to be vulnerable and ask for help because it will change your life,' she advised Instagram followers, who now number over a million.
