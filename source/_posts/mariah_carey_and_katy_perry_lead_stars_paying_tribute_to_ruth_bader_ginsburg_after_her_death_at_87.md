'Her rest is earned': 'I know we can't live forever, I only wish she could have,' wrote Goldie Hawn while Kerry Washington tweeted that 'It is our turn to fight'

'February 14, 2020. I was with Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg honoring her great work What an accomplished and very great lady!!!!!! May she Rest In Peace amidst this utter chaos!!!!!!!!!,' wrote Martha. 

'May you Rest In Peace RBG. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!' wrote Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills Lisa Rinna.

Star Wars icon Mark Hamill wrote: 'Gut wrenching loss...Could 2020 be any more brutal and cruel? #RIPRuthBaderGinsburg.'

Orange Is The New Black star Uzo Aduba toasted: 'To Ruth,' and Shameless lead Emmy Rossum tweeted that the news was 'f***ing heart breaking.' 

'Ahhhhhhh mannnnnnnnn,' wrote Glee actor Darren Criss, as Rosie O'Donnell lamented: 'nooooooooooooo #rbg.'

'No one fought harder. We must continue in her footsteps,' wrote Billy Eichner on his Twitter page in response to the news. 'She refused to rest up until the bitter end. Neither should we. RIP the great, great, GREAT RBG.'

Sophia Bush declared she was 'Truly and utterly gutted. And grateful. And in awe. And just so devastated. An icon and a hero. #RBG.' 

Shortly before her death Ginsburg said: 'My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.' 

The election in November pits Republican incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump  against the Democrat former vice president Joe Biden.

Supreme Court Justices are nominated by the President Of The United States and then confirmed by the Senate.

Early this month Trump unveiled a short-list of potential Supreme Court nominees including Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley.

If Trump picks Ginsburg's replacement the balance of the court will be six Republican appointees to three Democrat ones, whereas if Biden chooses there will be four Democrat appointees to five Republican ones, as when Ginsburg was alive.

January Jones of Mad Men fame acknowledged the impact of Ginsburg's death on the election when she posted a tribute to the late judge this Friday.

Sharing Ginsburg's high school yearbook photo, Jones wrote: 'Rest in sweet peace to this beautiful champion of the people. Please vote. #RBG.'

Andy Cohen posted the hashtag: '#MerrickGarland,' the name of the judge President Obama nominated to the Supreme Court in March 2016.

Obama submitted Garland as a nominee after the death of the court's conservative firebrand Antonin Scalia precipitating a huge row.

The Republican Senate refused to hold confirmation hearings for him, saying the next president should get to pick Scalia's as it was Obama's last year.

When Obama was replaced by Donald Trump the new Republican president nominated Neil Gorsuch whom the Senate confirmed. 

Sarah Silverman also had an eye on the prospect of a conservative Ginsburg replacement as she paid her respects.

'RIP RBG. Gutted Sad. Grateful for all she did. And very very scared,' wrote the acclaimed comedian and actress.
