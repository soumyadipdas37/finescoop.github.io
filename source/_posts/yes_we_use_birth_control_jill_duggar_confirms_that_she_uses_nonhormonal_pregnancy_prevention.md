Jill Duggar — one of 19 children born to parents who have said they left family planning up to God — has confirmed that she and her husband, Derick Dillard, use birth control.

The 29-year-old revealed in a new Q&A video on YouTube today that she and Derick, 31, use non-hormonal birth control methods to prevent pregnancy, but they do intend to eventually have more siblings for their sons Israel, five, and Samuel, three.

The couple — who have discussed alcohol, tattoos, and Jill's family in past video Q&As — also shared their feelings on the LGBTQ+ community, insisting that they have LGBTQ+ friends even though they believe homosexuality is 'sinful.'

Surprise! Jill Duggar — one of 19 children born to parents who have said they left family planning up to God — has confirmed that she and her husband, Derick Dillard, use birth control

No glove, no love! The 29-year-old revealed in a new Q&A video on YouTube today that she and Derick, 31, use non-hormonal birth control methods to prevent pregnancy

Derick has commented on social media in the past that he is not against birth control, admitting that his own parents used it — but this is the first time that he and Jill have confirmed outright that they use it, too.

'Yes, we use birth control,' Jill said, 'but we prefer to use non-hormonal birth control methods, just because we don't want to use anything that could potentially cause an abortion.'

It is a myth that the Pill can cause abortion, since it works to prevent an egg from being fertilized in the first place. In cases where women do become unintentionally pregnant while on the Pill, the fetus can be exposed to high levels of progestin and/or estrogen, but neither causes abortion — and research indicates that it won't negatively impact the fetus, either.

However, this myth is one that has been promoted by members of Jill's family, including her parents, Jim Bob and Michelle. 

The couple initially used hormonal birth control after welcoming their first child, Josh, and Michelle miscarried while taking it. They saw the miscarriage as a sign from God and gave up birth control thereafter.

Though Jill hasn't adopted their anti-birth-control stance, she does seem to have taken on their scientifically-unsound belief that the Pill can cause abortion.

Unprotected: Her parents, Jim Bob and Michelle, used hormonal birth control early on, but Michelle miscarried while taking it. They saw the miscarriage as a sign from God 

Nonstop: They have since been outspoken against birth control, welcoming 19 kids in all

'There are probably uses for hormonal methods of birth control for, like, regulating things, and stuff like that. But for us, we just want to be careful about that, and we're just, like, more natural-minded,' she said.

'I know that sometimes there can be more longer-lasting effects from hormonal birth controls and stuff like that. So we just steer clear of those... Eventually, we want to have more kids and stuff. We're willing. So we don't want to mess too much with all that,' she said.

Derick added that they also want to be able to easily stop birth control whenever they want to get pregnant.

The couple also answered a viewer question about whether they have non-Christian friends and are 'accepting' of the LGBTQ+ community. 

'Yes, we have lots of non-Christian friends,' Derick said. 'We have friends that are part of the LGBTQ+ community. 

'I think it's a misconception that just because you disagree with someone that you can't be friends. And in light of the recent passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I think Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg's relationship in the legal profession was a good example of that. From what I hear, they had a great relationship despite having sharp disagreements at times.'

'Yes, we have lots of non-Christian friends,' Derick said. 'We have friends that are part of the LGBTQ+ community'

Flashback: Derick came under fire in 2017 for calling being transgender a 'myth' and saying he 'pitied' fellow TLC star Jazz Jennings (pictured)

Jill chimed in: 'You can disagree with someone and still be respectful, and still be friends.

'As Christians, we believe that there are certain things that are sinful, like adultery — so, cheating on your spouse or something — or sex before marriage, [or] homosexuality. Those are things that we believe are sinful. 

'But there's a lot of things [that are sinful], too, so it doesn't mean that we might not be friends with people, because ultimately, we're all sinners. 

'If I'm around somebody, they might know what I believe, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna just rub it in their face all the time either. So, I have friends who I hand out with, and we do not agree on everything.'

Derick also noted that, hypothetically, if a transgender friend invited them over, he would respect that friend's chose pronouns. 

'I'm gonna use whatever pronoun they want me to,' he said. 

However, he added, their faith is 'very important' to them, and 'generally people talk about what's important to them' — so being friends with a gay person or trans person isn't going to stop them from talking about their beliefs. But they do recognize that there is a time and a place for every discussion. 

Respect: Derick insisted that, hypothetically, if a trans friend invited him over, he'd use the friend's chosen pronouns

Belief system: Yet Jill and Derick both still said they believed homosexuality is a sin 

Changing his tune? Previously, he had used male pronouns for Jazz, who prefers she/her 

'I think it's healthy to have discussions and even debates, for those of you who like to debate, in the right space,' Jill said. 'But you want to be respectful, self-controlled. Oftentimes, I see people who are not and that's disheartening.'

Derick added that the mark of a good friendship is when you can discuss a hotly debated topic and then 'go have a beer afterwards.'

His remarks about using a trans person's preferred pronouns may be a shock to Duggar followers given Derick's past comments about trans TLC star Jazz Jennings.

In 2017, Derick went on a Twitter rant against Jazz when her show was promoted by the network, writing: 'What an oxymoron... a "reality" show which follows a non-reality. "Transgender" is a myth. Gender is not fluid; it's ordained by God.'

'I pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child. It's sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, unfortunate what's on TV these days.'

At the time, Derick did not use Jazzs preferred pronouns — she/her — though his opinion and behavior may have evolved in the past three years. 

Finally, the couple opened up about finances, reiterating the claim that they were not paid by TLC for appearing on Counting On. 

Grownup: Jill has been setting her own path with Derick, separate from her family — and that involves wearing pants, piercing her nose, and cutting her hair

'Up until the time we left the show, we hadn't been paid for anything,' Jill said. 

'Of course, there were perks that came along with filming, you know, if we were traveling or whatever they might have covered those expenses. And we were grateful for those. 

'But we hadn't been paid until we were really pressing about it and ended up getting an attorney involved and stuff,' she said. 

'Basically, once we got an attorney involved, we were able to recover a portion at least of what Jill should have been paid,' Derick added, but said that it only amounted to a bit more than minimum wage.

Derick has slammed TLC and Jill's father Jim Bob in the past with similar accusations, insisting on more than one occasion that Jim Bob controlled the contracts — and the purse strings — when it came to the show.  

These days, the couple said they are living debt-free, with Derick paying for law school with work and schoalrships. 

They also make money through blogging, social media partnerships, and a monetized YouTube channel. 

Plus, they said, they make a point to have clear, open discussions about money with monthly budget meetings, wherein they set spending budgets for the month and agree upon any larger purchase.    

Real talk: In a previous Q&A, Jill admitted that her family is 'not always' supportive of her decisions

Rule makers: Jill's parents, Jim Bob and Michelle, are incredibly strict

In the couple's last Q&A video, Jill admitted that her family is 'not always' supportive of what she does, but while she wants to have 'deference' toward them, she refuses to be 'led by fear'' and 'controlled by what somebody else is gonna think.'

Her super-strict Christian upbringing involved a lot of rules — especially for the girls. The Duggars' modest dressing ideals mean long skirts and dresses, covered-up shoulders and décolletage, and long, curly hair for females in the family.

The kids were all homeschooled, alcohol was off-limits, and the girls generally weren't encouraged to set career or education goals, which might conflict with being a wife and mother.

But Jill, more than any of her siblings, has been setting her own path with Derick, separate from her family.

'Are they supportive? Not always,' she admitted. 'Everyone's gonna have their opinion about different things. Some of my siblings are probably more likely to have something to say about it than others. Some are more like, "Hey, I'm happy for whatever y'all are deciding."

'Not all of them are cool with it but some of them are more cool with it than others,' she added. 

Though she said it's still important to listen to the advice of people close to you, she also insisted that 'you don't want to be overly fearful and be led by fear.'  

Healthy attitude: Though she said it's still important to listen to the advice of people close to you, she also insisted that 'you don't want to be overly fearful and be led by fear' 

Guess which ones are the most judgmental! She said 'not all of' her siblings 'are cool with' her choices, 'but some of them are more cool with it than others'

'You want to have deference but you also don't want to be controlled by what somebody else is gonna think,' Jill explained.

For the mother of two, seeking out professional help has made a difference. 

'Therapy's been really helpful,' she said.

Though they 'haven't changed who we are as people,' Jill admitted that some of her views, which are still guided by her faith, have changed a little bit now that she has been able to do more research.

Several of the changes she's made have been to her appearance. She and her sisters were all raised with very long, curly hair, but recently Jill chopped off quite a few inches.  

'My hair was so heavy and it was giving me headaches,' she said. Because it was a 'decent amount,' she was also able to donate it.

She also got her nose pierced a few years ago after discussing it with Derick. 

'I liked it, we talked about it. I kind of always thought they were cute, nose piercings. But ... even if I liked something before, I wouldn't have done it because of maybe some of the backlash that I would get from people close to me, or something. I just hate confrontation so I would have avoided it,' she said.

He approves: Jill said she always thought nose piercings were 'cute,' and when Derick said he was OK with it, she got one for herself

Modesty: She also started wearing pants and shorts after growing up in only skirts and dresses 

Makeover time: Derick added that 'not being closely associated with the show anymore has allowed that decision to happen more organically' (the Duggars pictured in 2002) 

'I think growing as a person, growing closer together as a couple is helpful. So when Derick told me he was cool with me getting my nose pierced... we decided that it was cool. 

'Because of the journey that we've made as a couple, I was more comfortable with decisions that we make as a family. Like basically having healthy boundaries and everything, and being OK sometimes with other people not being OK is a hard thing but as long as we knew that the decisions were not wrong, they were just ones that other people might not make for themselves, then that's, like, good for us,' she said.

Derick added that 'not being closely associated with the show anymore has allowed that decision to happen more organically.'

As for wearing pants, Jill said it wasn't 'a reactionary thing,' but she did follow the bible's words to 'leave and cleave' and that led her to 'reevaluate things.' 

'I felt like I could be modest and wear pants,' she said.

She and Derick aren't even anti-tattoo, though neither has one just yet. 

'We're not against tattoos,' said Jill. 'I'm a very sentimental person, so I could see myself getting a tattoo... except for that I hate needles'

Jill and Derick have two kids, Israel and Samuel, and said they would like more: 'I don't know that we have a number. Probably not 20 kids, but again, we're not gonna rule anything out'

'We're not against tattoos,' said Jill. 'Biblically, I don't think there's something wrong with it. 

'I'm a very sentimental person, so I could see myself getting a tattoo... except for that I hate needles,' she added.

Finally, the couple talked about the possibility of growing their family, revealing that they would like more kids but don't know how many. 

'Yes, we would love more kids if God chooses to give us more,' said Jill.

'How many? I don't know that we have a number. Probably not 20 kids, but again, we're not gonna rule anything out. If God wants us to run an orphanage or something...' she went on.

'Derick's mom was adopted, so adoption has always had a special place in our heart.' 

In their first candid Q&A video, Jill and Derick addressed a recent Instagram photo that showed her drinking an alcoholic piña colada. 

Transparency: The couple has been candid in three Q&A videos on YouTube this month

'Growing up, the whole idea of drinking was not encouraged,' Jill said. Even though she drinks now, she never gets drunk

'We try and practice what the bible says about anything, and as far as alcohol, the scripture is pretty clear that drunkenness is absolutely sinful,' Derick said.

'Neither one of us has ever drank to drunkenness and don't ever plan to. But that doesn't mean that Jill wouldn't have a piña colada at dinner or something.'

'We also just want to be careful and sensitive to other people, too. You just have to know yourself and your boundaries,' added Jill.

'Even with our kids and stuff, eventually — obviously, they're really young right now — but eventually, I think it's good... for them to see, like, a healthy balance in our lives,' she went on.

She also admitted to People that her attitudes are a departure from how she was raised. 

'Growing up, the whole idea of drinking was not encouraged,' she said. 

'I know my parents would not be happy with it, and I know that my siblings, some more than others, would probably have an issue with it. Other ones would probably be like, "Whatever's good for y’all, that's fine. Live your life." 

'So far nobody's said anything to us about it,' she added.  

Freedom! Jill was pictured enjoying a piña colada while out for a date night with her husband Derick Dillard earlier this month



Good for her! She confirmed that it was a 'regular' alcoholic version of the drink in the comments

'We have boundaries,' she went on. 'In our faith, we believe like we're not supposed to get drunk. 

'So, with drinking, it's not like we're just like going crazy. It’s more socially here and there, or at home, for a date or something. Our kids are pretty young right now, but I think it's good for them to see a healthy balance.' 

Branching out: This summer, she shared a sponsored Instagram post for a modest swimwear company, modeling several of their outfits

Jill's healthy attitude about alcohol in moderation has been a surprise to fans, who expected her to abstain completely like the rest of her family.

For some very religious Christians — Duggars included — even wine is off-limits, and they believe that references to wine in the Bible actually mean grape juice. 

In early September, she shocked social media followers when she and Derick enjoyed dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Arkansas and shared a picture showing a tasty-looking frozen drink in front of her. 

When commenters asked what she was sipping, she told them it was a piña colada — and further confirmed that it was a 'regular' one, not a virgin one made without alcohol.

'Date night with my favorite person @derickdillard,' Jill wrote, captioning a photo of herself and Derick sitting side-by-side. 

'We’ve missed our regular date night outings during covid and have had lots of in home dates, but we were able to swap childcare with friends last night for a date!'

In the comments section, she responded to inquisitive fans asking about her drink choice, confirming that she was, in fact, having an alcoholic beverage.       

This summer, Jill also shared a sponsored Instagram post for a modest swimwear company, modeling several of their outfits. 

Big boy time: Jill's oldest son Israel started kindergarten in late August. Jill was homeschooled

Off they go! The whole family went with Israel to drop him off at the school, and all four of them donned face masks per the school's new regulations 

And on August 24, she dropped her oldest son, Israel, off at his first day of kindergarten in public school after she and her siblings had all been homeschooled. 

The proud mom seemed thrilled to be sending her five-year-old off on an adventure she herself never got to have. 

'It's working out pretty good. [Israel] is getting used to it,' she said in the first video Q&A session. 

On the decision to send her children to school when she herself was homeschooled, Jill said: 'Even though I grew up homeschooled ... we just talked about it, prayed about it, we felt lie this is the right timing for us. We moved right next to a really good school and in a good community, so I think it just made sense for us.  

'It was definitely both of us making that decision,' she added, noting that they gave careful consideration to the choice and didn't make decisions out of fear.

Unfortunately, some of this — and the couple's refusal to film for the family's TLC reality show anymore — has led to strained relationships with Jill's parents.

Derick has claimed on numerous occasions that Jill's father, Jim Bob, restricts her visits to their home — and that Jill has to ask permission to come over, especially if Jim Bob isn't there. 

Down with the tyrant! Meanwhile, Derick has been calling out Jill's dad Jim Bob for restricting their access to the rest of the family 

Enabler: Jim Bob reportedly restricts Jill's access to the family home, and she is unwelcome at some family gatherings — but Jill's abuser, sex pest Josh, is inexplicably welcome

Jill even reportedly had to get permission from Jim Bob to go do her sister Jessa's house when she gave birth to daughter Ivy last year.

Derick has had some truly scathing words for his father-in-law, who doesn't seem to place similar restrictions on older son Josh, who admitted molesting four of his younger sisters, including Jill, as well as a fourth child when he was a teenager. 

In July, he even went so far as to compare Jim Bob, 55, to Jeffrey Epstein, accusing him of placing a higher importance on money than following Jesus.

'[Counting On is] is still under his control. And he will attack the victims if they threaten his show.

'We were humiliated and threatened when we first tried to not film,' he added. 

'We have to break this culture, that cares more about money and ratings than protecting the most vulnerable. 

'Jeff Epstein already showed us that if you have enough money, power, and influence, you can get away with anything. Sadly, it doesn’t stop with him. There are many more stories in this world that are not too different, existing in a culture where it can still thrive.'
