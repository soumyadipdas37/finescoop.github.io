Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny's son Jett Kenny has shared an emotional tribute to his sister Jaimi following her shock death on Monday.

Posting an old photo of himself and Jaimi together, the 26-year-old model hinted that like many siblings their relationship wasn't always smooth sailing.

'I may not have been the best brother to you all the time, I know you thought you weren’t being the big sister I needed all the time, but I do know we loved one another unconditionally all the time,' he wrote.

Heartbreaking: Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny's son Jett Kenny has shared an emotional tribute to his sister Jaimi following her shock death on Monday

''I may not have been the best brother to you all the time': Posting an old photo of himself and Jaimi together, the 26-year-old model hinted that like many siblings their relationship wasn't always smooth sailing 

'I will love you forever. Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one. You will be dearly missed by all whose lives you touched.'

A number of celebrities responded to Jett's post to share their condolences, including Grant Denyer, Erin Holland, Lincoln Lewis, and Alicia Banit. 

The Curry-Kenny family confirmed Jaimi's death on Monday afternoon, releasing a statement in which they expressed their heartbreak and also asked the public to allow them to 'grieve in privacy'.

'I will love you forever. Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one,' he wrote

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement, which was written by Jaimi's father, Grant.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child.

'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us the extra time we were able to spend with her.

'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'

Neither the family's statement on Monday nor Lisa's Instagram update on Tuesday specified the exact nature of Jaimi's illness.

Jaimi had long battled an eating disorder, with her family supporting her through years of treatment at a private clinic.

She had been supported by her parents and siblings through many years of treatment at private clinic End ED, on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.
