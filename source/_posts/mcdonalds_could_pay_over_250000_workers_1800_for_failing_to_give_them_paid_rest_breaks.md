More than 250,000 current and former McDonald's workers in Australia could be entitled to payouts of more than $1,800 from the fast food giant. 

Shine Lawyers and the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union are leading a class action against McDonalds' over claims it failed to provide employees with paid rest breaks. 

The class action comes after former McDonald's worker Chiara Staines won a case against Brisbane McDonald's franchisee Tantex Holdings in late August. 

Justice John Logan concluded it was a 'workplace right' to access the toilet or drink water and Ms Staines was paid $1,000 in compensation and $800 for time not paid.

Vicky Antzoulatos from Shine Lawyers said Ms Staines' successful case has set a legal precedent for the class action to take place. 

'This breach could be the tip of the iceberg with potentially hundreds of thousands of staff, both past and present, affected, if McDonald's and its franchisees have breached the Fair Work Act across the board,' Ms Antzoulatos said.

'Every Australian McDonald's worker has the legal right to a paid break when working a shift of four hours or more. This is in addition to workers' rights to access the toilet or to take a drink of water outside scheduled breaks.'

Darcy Dunlop, 22, worked at McDonald's for over four years and had progressed to the role of Area Leader when he was refused paid breaks for his team members at the Erina fast-food franchise in NSW, in 2018.

'You can't sit, you can't lean, you can't go to the toilet without permission or get a drink water, and if you ask for your owed break to be rostered in, you look like you're letting your whole team down by being a trouble-maker,' Mr Dunlop said.

'Your stress levels rise, the kitchen feels hotter, the finish line to a shift feels even further away, and I know this impacts on workers right across Australia, which is why I urge everyone to get involved.'

Ms Antzoulatos said break denials primarily affected young people as 80 per cent of affected workers are estimated to be under 21.  

She said the 250,000 workers could each be entitled to more than $1,800 depending on the amount of hours worked and breaks denied. 

'She (Ms Staines) received $1,000 in compensation and $800 for her unpaid rest breaks. So, if you extrapolate that off the entire McDonald's network, it's a very sizeable sum,' Ms Antzoulatos said on Sunrise. 

If the 250,000 workers were paid the same amount as Ms Staines ($1,800), McDonald's would have to fork out a total of $450 million. 

A McDonald's spokesman said they are 'yet to receive any notification of the proposed class action and are unable to comment on the veracity of the trade association's claims'. 

'We continue to work closely with our restaurants to ensure employees receive all the correct workplace entitlements and pay,' he said. 

'We are of course disappointed this did not happen in the instance of Tantex Holdings Pty Ltd.

'As was represented to the Court at the time, the franchisee's breach of the Enterprise Agreement was unintentional and did not result in any form of underpayment of wages.'

Ms Staines was paid $1,000 in compensation and $800 for time not paid. Vicky Antzoulatos from Shine Lawyers said a 'sizeable sum' could be owed to 250,000 Australian workers 

The spokesman said franchisee Tantex Holdings has now implemented processes to ensure ongoing compliance with paid breaks. 

Fast Food Workers Union Secretary Josh Cullinan said a potential nationwide breach of agreement could have mass implications.

'They've got young, vulnerable and hardworking crews locked into a huge system that appears to be great for McDonald's but is crippling the workers,' Mr Cullinan said.

'When we litigated Ms Staines' case she was paid over $1,800 in compensation and we believe her experience is the average experience for a quarter of a million Australian workers who have worked at McDonald's since September 2014.'
