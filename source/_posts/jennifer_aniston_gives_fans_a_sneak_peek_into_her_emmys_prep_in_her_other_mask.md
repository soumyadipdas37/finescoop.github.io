While there will be no star-studded red carpet at the Emmy Awards this year, Jennifer Aniston is getting ready for TV's biggest day from home.

The 51-year-old actress shared a new snap from her home on Instagram, where she gave fans a glimpse of her Emmy prep.

The Friends star even made a face mask joke as TV's best and brightest prepare for a major awards show amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aniston was seen blowing a kiss while wearing grey pajamas while holding a glass of champagne and wearing a masque treatment on her face.

'Emmys prep... in my other mask,' she joked, while including a face mask emoji and two champagne glass emoji.

'Congratulations to the nominees and all of the amazing performances we’ve seen this year' she concluded with a heart emoji and clapping emojis.

Aniston is one of the nominees herself this year, up for Lead Actress in a Drama series for her work in Apple TV Plus' The Morning Show.

She is nominated alongside The Crown's Olivia Colman, Killing Eve's Jodie Comer, Ozark's Laura Linney, Killing Eve's Sandra Oh and Euphoria's Zendaya.  



First Emmy: If Aniston wins tonight, it will mark her second Emmy win, following her 2002 win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Friends

Aniston also earned four more Emmy nominations for her time on Friends, plus Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her stint on 30 Rock in 2009.

The Morning Show marks Aniston's first return to TV in a starring role, playing Alex Levy in The Morning Show, inspired by Brian Stelter's book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.

Alex Levy is an anchor on a hit morning show in New York, whose partner gets fired after a sexual misconduct scandal as she fights to keep her job from emerging reporter Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon).

Aniston is coming off a highly-publicized virtual reunion with ex Brad Pitt at a table read of the Fast Times at Ridgemont High script last week.

She is also attached to star in Hail Mary, playing Denise White, a former Miss USA contestant becomes a successful sports manager.

She is also slated to reunite with all of her Friends co-stars in a Friends reunion special for HBO Max, though it remains to be seen when it will start production.
