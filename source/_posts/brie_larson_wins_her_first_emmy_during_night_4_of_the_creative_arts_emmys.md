Four years after winning her Best Actress Oscar for her stirring performance in Room, Brie Larson has won her first Emmy for an innovative VR experience.

Larson, 30, won Outstanding Interactive Program for Oculus' The Messy Truth VR Experience, which she produced with Van Jones, Jana Carter and her boyfriend Elijah Allan-Blitz, who also directed the program.

The Captain Marvel's Emmy win was one of the many highlights during Night 4 of the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, including Trent Reznor's first Emmy win, putting him just one Tony Award shy of the coveted EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) win.
