Lady Gaga clearly misses being on tour.

The 34-year-old shared an Instagram selfie this week and wrote she was 'Wishing we were all at the Chromatica Ball right now.'

She released her latest album Chromatica at the end of May amid the coronavirus lockdowns and typically names her tours 'Balls.'

Referring to songwriter and music producer Michael Tucker she wrote: 'miss you @bloodpop I never could have made this album without you.'

The A Star is Born star also posted an evocative Instagram selfie where she pulled a supermodel stare and raised one of her long fingernails to her lips. 

At the end of the week she let her Instagram following in on her 'Artist life,' modeling a black crop top and nude sweats as she posed by a driveway.

She accessorized her look with a pair of rhinestone cat-eye sunglasses and a bulging black striped handbag for her Friday Instagram post.

Gaga has had her sea green and platinum hairdo since last month and debuted it on Instagram with a smoldering lingerie snap.

In her caption she revealed that the hair color was 'Suzie's Ocean Blonde' in honor of the late mother of her longtime hairstylist Frederic Aspiras.

She set pulses racing this past Sunday when she got together with Ariana Grande to perform for the MTV Video Music Awards.

The dynamic duo were masked up to deliver a rendition of their duet Rain On Me for which they also won three awards - best song, collaboration and cinematography.

Gaga earned two more awards at Sunday night's extravaganza, best artist and the inaugural Tricon prize, making her the biggest winner of the night.

In accordance with coronavirus safety procedures the performances for the awards show were all recorded separately from one another.
