Her and fellow pop diva Lady Gaga wowed their united fanbases, while performing their hit Rain On Me at Sunday's virtual MTV Video Music Awards ceremony.

And Ariana Grande took to Instagram after the show to pen a touching tribute to the Born This Way singer, 34, and to share behind-the-scenes snapshots of their performance.  

'thank u so much for having me @ladygaga i love u with all my heart always,' began the 27-year-old Sweetner songstress in her post's caption.

'u were so beyond brilliant tonight. so grateful to have been a part of this with u. & thank u again @mtv.'

The first image in Ariana's virtual photo album showed her and Gaga donning some next level face masks, while rehearsing choreography in a studio space.

Gaga's mask had the logo for her latest studio album Chromatica printed on it in a metallic shade of pink and it had silver spikes sewn into it, while Ariana's was completely covered in sparkling rhinestones. 

The ladies appeared to have on grey sports bras and they both rocked colorful eyeshadow looks.

Ariana included a brief clip in her slideshow that she took while getting her hair done before the big show.

Hands can be seen wrapping hair around the base of her pigtail as she posed for her front-facing camera. 

One particularly noteworthy image was one of Ariana pumping a generous helping of hand sanitizer into Gaga's open palms. 

The pair were fully dressed in their performance outfits and had on face masks, while seemingly hanging out backstage.
