Natalie Bassingthwaighte is the latest celebrity to pack up and move to Byron Bay.

The singer and actress moved her partner, Cameron McGlinchey, and their two children, daughter Harper and son Hendrix, to the trendy coastal town earlier this year.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the 45-year-old said that she managed to relocate from Melbourne right before the coronavirus pandemic hit.

'We sold our house, we did everything in the right order without realising what was going to unfold,' she recently told the publication.

'We are feeling very grateful and very blessed. It has been such a roller-coaster for so many people so we are feeling very lucky.'

Other Australian celebrities that have shacked up in Byron Bay include Elyse Knowles, controversial chef Pete Evans, and The Block host Shelley Craft.

Hollywood star Zac Efron is rumoured to be thinking about making a move to Byron Bay too.

Comedian Ed Kavalee, 41, said last week that Zac's presence in the town could potentially spells disaster for locals.

'No, no, just even hearing the words... I mean Byron was already teetering and now it's gone... that's terrible news!' he said on the Hughesy & Ed drive show.

Ed warned that an influx of American celebrities could soon follow if word spreads that Byron Bay is a haven for young Hollywood stars.

'Because where one goes, they all follow,' he said.

Ed's radio co-host Dave 'Hughesy' Hughes supported Zac and said that he would like to see more celebrities in Byron Bay.

But Ed strongly disagreed, saying that a wave of famous actors would result in house prices going through the roof.

Having so many celebrities in town could also make it difficult for locals to gain entry to venues, he argued.

Ed explained: 'It's already expensive. Prices will go through the roof. You'll try and go to a café and they'll be like "Sorry, not today" and there's four people in there and it'll be Efron and his buddies and someone else!'

Dave said this was unfair, and pointed out that Zac 'blends in' with the locals and 'wants to hang out in Australia and live a real life'.

He also noted that famous Byron Bay locals, like Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky, don't get special treatment and are considered part of the community.
