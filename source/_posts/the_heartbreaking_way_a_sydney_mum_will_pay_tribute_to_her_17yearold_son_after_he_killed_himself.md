The mother of a 17-year-old boy who tragically took his own life will mark what would have been his 18th birthday by getting a tattoo.

Two years before his death, Timothy Owen Dalton wrote a to do list of everything he wanted to experience in his life.

As well as travelling the world and working on a feature film set - getting a tattoo was also a top priority.

His devoted mother Bronwyn Courts will go through with the heartbreaking tribute to her son on September 30, five months after he took his own life on April 29.

She is now calling on everyone to 'step back' form the hustle and bustle of everyday life and take a moment to show kindness to others, as Australia's marks RUOK? Day.

The devastated family's 'candle for kindness' campaign came as a result of COVID-19 restrictions around public gatherings.

Only 20 people were allowed to attend Timothy's funeral service, so the grieving family asked others who couldn't attend, to light a candle and perform a random act of kindness in honor of his memory.

Ms Courts said lockdown came at a terrible time for Timmy, who was a talented young photographer and film-maker.

He had been battling depression for three years and left school in 2019, but Timmy had just enrolled in a photography course at TAFE. 

'TAFE was shut, he wasn't sure when it was going to reopen. He had still been seeing his schoolmates on the weekend because everyone was having their 18th birthday parties, then that stopped,' Ms Courts told 9News.

Ms Courts said lockdown came at a terrible time for Timmy (pictured), who was a talented young photographer and film-maker.

'He'd done a barista course as he wanted to get a job in a coffee shop, and he had taken his resume to all the local coffee shops, but at that stage they were all shutting.' 

'It was just all these little things that shut down his feeling of hope for his future.'

Ms Courts described the day officers knocked on the door of her Wahroonga home as the worst moment in her life.

She said Timothy was open about his struggles with mental health but found it very difficult to get treatment.

His heartbroken mother is now calling for mental health conditions to receive the same level of attention, care and treatment, as physical illnesses.  

When the coronavirus restrictions are eased, Ms Courts said she plans to hold a public exhibition showcasing Timothy's photography to raise money for charity and help other who may be facing a similar situation.
