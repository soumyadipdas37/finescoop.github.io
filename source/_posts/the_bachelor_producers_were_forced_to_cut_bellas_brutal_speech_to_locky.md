Bella Varelis was visibly furious when Locky Gilbert dumped her on Thursday night's season finale of The Bachelor, right after telling her he was 'falling in love' with her.

But apparently viewers didn't see the half of it.

The 25-year-old marketing manager told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday that producers had to edit out much of her scathing reaction to Locky's break-up speech.

What you DIDN'T see on The Bachelor: Producers were forced to cut Bella Varelis' scathing speech to Locky Gilbert after he dumped her in the season finale after saying 'I love you'

'Did you let him have it any more than what we saw?' radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson asked.

'Yeah, I honestly, I went numb,' Bella responded.

'The thing is, right, I was walking up to him and I genuinely loved him. You don't want to see the person that you love crying like that. That's why I was consoling him.

'Did I think that I was going to be the one standing at the end wiping the tears off his face? No, I thought it would have been the other way round at least.

'But I don't know... I did kind of give it to him a little bit.'

Host Kyle Sandilands interjected: 'I knew something had been edited out! I was waiting for you to just put your finger in his face and say, "Eff you" What did you say?'

Bella replied: 'I might have been like, "You've got honour tattooed on your chest, mate." And then I kind of looked and was like, "Can I leave?"'

'What did he say to that?' asked Jackie, to which Bella responded: 'He said nothing.

'He's got honour tattooed on his chest. Don't tell me you're in love with me and then be like, "I love you, but not enough."'
