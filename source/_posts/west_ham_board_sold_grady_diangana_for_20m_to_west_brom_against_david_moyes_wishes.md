A civil-war has broken out at West Ham after the club overruled manager David Moyes in the decision to sell Grady Diangana. 

The Hammers head coach wanted to keep their prospect according to The Sun but the club instead sold their talented prospect to relegation rivals West Brom for £20million. 

To make matters worse, West Ham suffered an embarrassing defeat on Saturday as their pre-season preparations came to an end against relegated Bournemouth at the London Stadium.

The Hammers lost 3-5 to the Cherries, who ran rampant in London as they prepare for life in the Championship this season.

The defeat has added insult to injury after the club's players shared their anger over the sale of winger Diangana to West Brom on Friday night.

In response to Diangana's move to their Premier League rivals, West Ham captain Mark Noble tweeted: 'As captain of this football club I'm gutted, angry and sad that Grady has left, great kid with a great future!!!!!' 

Declan Rice 'liked' Noble's tweet in a show of support from the Chelsea target, whilst Jack Wilshere had a sly dig at the club hierachy for the decision.

On a post that the 22-year-old posted thanking West Ham for his time with the club, the former Arsenal man did not hold back as he commented: 'Go and do your thing in a club that respects you. Big player with a big future.' 

The winger played a huge part in Slaven Bilic's Baggies side last season that earned automatic promotion back to the topflight.

He made 31 appearances for West Brom last season, scoring eight goals and setting up six more.

Ultimately, Diangana opted to rejoin the former Hammers boss at the Hawthorns in another disappointing transfer blow for the London club.

The club provided a statement in which they explained their reasons for selling Diangana, who many of the fans believed to be among their most talented attackers. 

The club said: 'Having found himself in competition with the likes of Felipe Anderson, Michail Antonio, Pablo Fornals, Robert Snodgrass and Andriy Yarmolenko for a wide attacking position, with Jarrod Bowen added to that list in January this year. 

'The decision to sell Grady has been made reluctantly but - ultimately - in the best interests of the Club and with the aim to strengthen the squad in different areas at this time.



'The money received for Grady will be reinvested entirely in the team, in line with the manager's targets.

'We believe that this will give us the best possible chance of ensuring we have a balanced squad to compete in the Premier League and capable of reaching our objectives and ambitions this season.' 

The winger had five years left on his deal at the London Stadium before leaving for the Midlands.
