President Donald Trump went on a Sunday morning tweet storm before heading to his Virginia golf course – making an incendiary charge at the state's governor after huge lines of early voters in the states. 

Trump retweeted his own tweet from Friday, where he predicted victory in the Old Dominion and attacked Gov. Ralph Northam.  

'Voting starts in Virginia TODAY, and we are going to WIN. You have a crazy Governor who wants to take away your guns, which he will do without me in office. He is in favor of executing babies after birth - this isn’t late-term abortion, this is a step way beyond!' Trump wrote.

President Donald Trump fired off tweets intended to fire up supporters in Virginia after early voting began there on Friday. He left the White House in golf spikes as he visited his private club in Virginia Sunday

An Associated Press fact check of a similar claim last week found it to be a 'gross distortion' of Democrat Northam's position on late term abortion. It was a reference to Northam's confusing comments in an interview last year where he said if a woman wants a baby while going into labor, the baby could be 'resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue.'

It was presumably a reference by Northam, a pediatric neurologist, to 'palliative care' where medical intervention is denied to a newborn expected to die due to abnormalities. 

'Vote!' Trump wrote while firing off the retweet.

President Donald J. Trump plays golf at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, USA, 27 June 2020. Trump was back at the course Sunday, after firing off tweets about Virginia and the Supreme Court

He followed up, writing: 'I’m playing for your guns, and I’m playing for your values. For all the Federal Employees in Virginia, remember, it was me that got you the Federal Pay Raises, not Sleepy Joe Biden. I’ll be having a Big Rally in Virginia, to be announced soon!' he said.

Trump signed military pay raises that were enacted by Congress. President Barack Obama also backed military pay raises while Biden was with him in the White House. 

 Voters stood in long lines in Virginia on Friday, the first day of in-person early voting, during a year when Trump has savaged mail-in voting. 

Trump kept up the attack Sunday, retweeting Fox News contributor Sara Carter, who wrote: '.@RealDonaldTrump is absolutely correct that the worst threat to our election is the mailing of millions of unsolicited ballots - wait and see. These are not absentee ballots and the only reason any of the Dems are backing this is because they r targeting Trump & the Americans.'

Trump added: 'A giant SCAM, and the Dems know it!' 

Trump also said he personally was the 'only thing' protecting an overturning of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, in another comment directed at Virginia. 

'VIRGINIA, and everywhere else for that matter, I am the only thing standing between you and your 2nd Amendment. If I am re-elected, it is 100% SAFE. If not, it is GONE!' he wrote. 

He also referenced the bombshell issue that entered the race Friday with the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He retweeted his own comment to Republicans that 'We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices. We have this obligation, without delay!'

Trump also tweeted 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' and 'LAW & ORDER!' 

Trump's tweets fit a Sunday pattern of a busy morning online followed by a trip to the links. 

He arrived at his Virginia golf course on a sunny day before 11 am.
