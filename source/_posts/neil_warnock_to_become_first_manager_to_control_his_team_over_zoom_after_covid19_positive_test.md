Middlesbrough boss Neil Warnock will become the first manager to take charge of his side via Zoom on Saturday, as he continues to isolate after testing positive for Covid-19.

Sportsmail revealed on Friday that the 71-year-old is one of three cases at the club, but their Championship game at home to Bournemouth will go ahead as planned with 1,000 supporters inside the Riverside Stadium.

And Warnock is ready to make all of the key decisions as he watches live from his North-East home.

Neil Warnock has tested positive for coronavirus and won't attend Middlesbrough's next game

The 71-year-old will still take control of his team's game against Bournemouth on Saturday

Assistant Kevin Blackwell said: 'The beauty of modern technology - Zoom and things like that - is that we can actually speak to Neil and be in constant contact with him, while the game is going on. We will be using the technology to the best of our advantage.

'Neil has been a big part of the preparations. He'll be speaking to some of the players on the phone over the next 24 hours to talk about what he is expecting from them.

'Hopefully, he will speak to all of them before the game. He'll be watching from his house up here, and he has everything set up to communicate directly to the ground.'

Blackwell, meanwhile, says Warnock is feeling 'fine' in himself.

'That's the frustrating thing, if it was normal flu he'd be back, but we obviously follow all protocols,' he added.
