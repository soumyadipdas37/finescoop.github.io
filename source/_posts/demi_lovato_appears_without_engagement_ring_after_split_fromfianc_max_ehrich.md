Demi Lovato has shared her first Instagram post since it was revealed she has split from her fiancé Max Ehrich - without her engagement ring.

The singer, 28, and the American actor, 29, have called time on their relationship, after facing rumours earlier this month that Max, once sent 'thirsty messages' to Demi's former BFF Selena Gomez back in 2015.

Demi took to the social media platform hours after the news broke to share a video of herself with her glam squad, wearing a T-shirt with the words 'dogs over people' splashed across the chest, hinting at her current feelings.

Despite the news of the split it appeared to be business as usual for the pop sensation, who was seen surrounded by make-up and hair artists.

Demi also shared a snap of herself with an alien filter alongside the caption: 'mood'.

A source told People on Thursday: 'It was a tough decision, but Demi and Max have decided to go their separate ways to focus on their respective careers.' 

They added: 'They have respect and love for one another and will always cherish the time they spent together.' 

News that there was trouble in the relationship camera earlier in the day when another source told Page Six: 'It’s not over yet..., But it's on its way there.'

The outlet reported that Demi's bodyguard and sister unfollowed Max on Instagram, with the couple not engaging in like or comments on each others recent social media posts.

DailyMail.com reached out to Demi's representative regarding the matter but has so far been unavailable for comment.

Demi and Max have had a whirlwind romance, that started in March just before the coronavirus pandemic began. 

And sources later revealed that they had decided to quarantine together at Demi's house amid the lockdown.  

Demi and the former soap opera actor quickly began boasting about their love on social media.  

They announced their engagement in July, alongside a beachside photoshoot showing off Demi's shining diamond ring.

Earlier this month, Demi admitted they were considering eloping amid the pandemic limiting large gatherings to 10 people.

The singer shared that she wants their wedding to be 'sacred' between them, as she dished to Popcrush Nights.

Seeming torn between a big wedding and eloping she said 'On one hand, I would love to elope because my life is so public and I want to keep it sacred between me and him. 

Adding: 'On the other hand, I want my friends and family to be there for a celebration. But I can't do that until the pandemic's over because it's not safe.'

Their relationship seemed to hit rocky water earlier this month when fans claimed to have screenshots of tweets and other social media posts by Max pitting Demi and her former BFF Selena Gomez, against each other. 

Demi took to Instagram earlier this month to seemingly debunk a slew of viral screenshots that showed rude tweets made by Max, in 2015.  

'It's really sad when people FAKE images to put women against each other. If women have conflict that's between them NOT YOU,' the former Disney star wrote.

In the 'fake' tweets, Max allegedly wrote that Lovato's former best friend Selena  was 'prettier' and more vocally gifted that her.

In her Instagram Story posts, Demi appeared to passionately challenge the validity of the past tweets and she went as far as to urge 'tabloids' to write about 'more important sh*t.' 

'Secondly, don't y'all have more important s**t to write about in 2020??? I challenge any tabloid that dares to type my name to mention Breonna Taylor and the face that her murderers still haven't been arrested. WRITE ABOUT THAT,' she wrote

'I don't wanna look at what's really happening in the world either but WE HAVE TO. 

'Yes, it's easier to tear apart celebrities and their relationships because 2020 suck and scares the sh*t out of us all but it's only gonna stay terrifying until we address it all and WORK ON SOLUTIONS TOGETHER,' explained the Camp Rock star. 

One of Max's fake tweets read: 'Hahaha selena gomez and demi are cute together [sic] but boy if you think demi is prettier…you're WRONG!'

Torn apart: 'I don't wanna look at what's really happening in the world either but WE HAVE TO. Yes, it's easier to tear apart celebrities and their relationships because 2020 suck and scares the sh*t out of us all but it's only gonna stay terrifying until we address it all and WORK ON SOLUTIONS TOGETHER,' explained the Camp Rock star

Selena is, clearly, a touchy subject for Demi, being that the pair have endured a rocky friendship since rising to fame on Disney Channel in the mid-2000s.

Lovato opened up about their crumbling friendship in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in May.

'When you grow up with somebody, you're always going to have love for them. But I'm not friends with her, so it felt….I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best,' she explained.
