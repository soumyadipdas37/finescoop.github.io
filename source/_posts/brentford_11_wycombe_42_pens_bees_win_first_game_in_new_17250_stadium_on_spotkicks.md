Brentford won the first game in their brand-new stadium thanks to a penalty shootout victory over Wycombe Wanderers after a 1-1 draw in normal time.  

The Bees took the lead at around the half-hour mark as tall centre-half Ethan Pinnock headed in a delicious free-kick from Mathias Jensen to score the first competitive goal at the Brentford Community Stadium.

Wycombe's job got harder immediately after the interval as Dominic Gape was sent off for a high lunge on Jan Zamburek just two minutes into the second-half. 

Brentford beat Wycombe Wanderers on penalties in round one of the Carabao Cup

It was the first match at the west Londoners' new 17,250-capacity ground near Kew Bridge

Brentford nearly capitalised on the man advantage as new striker Ivan Toney fired straight at Ryan Allsop while Sergi Canos hit the post with a wonderful curling effort.

But the Chairboys hit back as Pinnock gave the ball away deep inside the Brentford half to Scott Kashket, who squared to Daryl Horgan to fire past Luke Daniels on his Wycombe debut. 

A penalty shootout followed, where Kashket saw his penalty saved by Daniels and substitute striker Marcus Forss netted the winning spot-kick to send the Bees through to round two.
