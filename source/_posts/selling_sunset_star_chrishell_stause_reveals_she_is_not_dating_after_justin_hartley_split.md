Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause is a single woman.

The 39-year-old beauty, who is preparing to compete on the 29th season of Dancing With The Stars, is not in a romance, she has said. In the fall, the TV veteran split from  husband Justin Hartley.

'I'm completely single and because of COVID, I haven't done much mingling,' the pretty blonde told Entertainment Tonight. 'I'm excited to mingle.'

Hartley of This Is Us fame shocked his fans when he filed for divorce with Stause in November 2019. 

Though Chrishell has been asked out, she has not made a move. 'I haven't taken the next step, no,' she said. 

And some men have approached her on DM. 'I have to say I have had a few, yes. Yeah it's been - I don't know how to answer that, I feel so weird. But yes, that has been a nice surprise,' she said.

'There's a few [people you might now], but I'm not going to tell you who,' added the small screen favorite.

Friends were 'completely shocked by Justin filing for divorce,' ET also stated from a source.

'The couple has always been incredible, with no signs of things being on the rocks. Friends are speculating this was an impulse on Justin's side due to something that happened, and are hopeful the couple can work things out.'

No new man: 'I'm completely single and because of COVID, I haven't done much mingling,' the pretty blonde told Entertainment Tonight . 'I'm excited to mingle'

She will next be seen on Dancing With The Stars with Tyra Banks as host

She shared on Selling Sunset that the divorce blindsided her.

He has yet to talk about what made him end their marriage. 

But Chrishell said she is in a 'positive space' these days.   

And she has a new show to look forward to: Dancing With the Stars which premieres September 14. 

As far as working on DWTS, Stause said she thinks her Selling Sunset co-stars will be happy for her. 

'I think the majority of them are going to be so excited for me. They're gonna be cheering me on. Not all of them, let's be honest, but that's OK,' she noted.

As far as the fighting, she is over it. 

'I mean, honestly I don't really care what she says anymore. I just don't,' Stause said.

The drama is intense: She came to fame on the reality TV show Selling Sunset which also features Christine Quinn, Maya Vander, Mary Fitzgerald, Romain Bonnet, Heather Rae Young, Davina Potratz, Amanza Smith, Jason and Brett Oppenheim

She has been quarreling with the show's villain, Christine Quinn.

'I'm just so past her opinion and caring about it, so she's earned that at this point. Trust me,' added Chrishell.

The pinup has also been dealing with a sad loss. In July her mother died after a battle with lung cancer. Last April, her father passed away, also from lung cancer. 

'I have dealt with personal stuff with my family, but even that... it just feels like it's just an important time to say yes to things, because you don't know how short life is,' she told ET about joining DWTS.

'You don't know how long you're going to be here. You're not promised anything, so if this year has taught me anything, it's just - even if it scares you, just say yes, dress up, show up, get out there,' she added.
