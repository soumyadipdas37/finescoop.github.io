The man accused of shooting dead a sergeant in a police station was described by his friends as a 'maths geek' who was 'good with weapons' in his school yearbook.

Louis De Zoysa, 23, is suspected of fatally wounding Sergeant Matiu Ratana, 54, after smuggling a revolver into a custody area in Croydon, South London, last Friday.

His yearbook entry featured a picture of him in school uniform with one friend saying he was 'very clever' and another adding: 'One day we will rule the world together'.

The photograph was taken when De Zoysa was aged 16 and in year 11 at John Fisher School, a 1,000-pupil Roman Catholic boys' comprehensive in Purley, South London.

 De Zoysa is suspected of shooting dead a police officer in Croydon, South London, last Friday

Yesterday police searched the home of De Zoysa, an autistic recluse from a middle-class family, who is the son of a Green Party campaigner and former yoga teacher.

Detectives arrested a second man in Norwich on suspicion of supplying the murder weapon used in the shooting as officers probed possible links to gang violence.

Armed officers also raided a former ammunition depot in Surrey as they sought to discover where the suspect obtained the weapon used to carry out the killing.

Sgt Ratana bled to death after being shot in the heart at 2.15am as he was preparing to search a handcuffed suspect who had been arrested on suspicion of intent to supply drugs and possession of ammunition in Croydon.

The suspect was in a holding cell when he is said to have reached into his trousers for the weapon and fired off five shots with his hands still cuffed behind his back, wounding himself in the process.

Last night De Zoysa was in a critical condition with a neck injury in hospital after having to be revived by doctors over the weekend.

Neighbours around his family's £700,000 terraced home in Norbury said the 'awkward' loner was autistic and suggested he had suffered from mental health issues which may have triggered a referral to Prevent – the Government's deradicalisation programme for suspected extremists – in 2018.

He is understood to have lived at the house with his mother Elizabeth, a translator who ran as a Green candidate in local elections, and his Sri Lankan father Channa, a former yoga teacher said to be passionate about recycling who repairs bicycles for free.

The Catholic couple, who run an events company, have five children. Local residents said police were often seen at the address.

One said: 'The police must have been to their house about a dozen times over the last three or four years. It's common knowledge that he's autistic and has learning difficulties and had mental health issues.

'We would see him walk by now and then but he'd never say hello. I've watched their children grow up – they've been there about 25 to 30 years.

'They were a tight-knit family who largely kept themselves to themselves.' Armed police were yesterday seen searching a farm property in the Banstead area of Surrey.

The 56-acre site was a former ammunitions dump in the Second World War.

Neighbours told of hearing a loud explosion – described as 'like a bomb going off' – at 5.40am on Saturday when armed police carried out a controlled explosion as they entered one of the buildings on the site.

Residents said they had previously seen a number of young men going to the site at night. One added: 'There was comings and goings late at night. It was a bit suspicious.'

Meanwhile, heartbroken members of the rugby club where Sgt Ratana was head coach linked arms as they laid his club jacket on the pitch and held a minute's silence yesterday.

Bosses at the club in East Grinstead, West Sussex, hailed him as an 'inspiring and much-loved' coach and 'irreplaceable figure'. The tragic policeman lived in Worthing with his partner Sue Bushby.
