Erin McNaught has been filming Channel Seven's new military-style reality show, SAS: Who Dares Wins.

And on Wednesday, the model was spotted enjoying a well earned holiday in Darwin with her husband Elliot 'Example' John Gleave, 38, and her children Evander, five, and Ennio, two. 

The 38-year-old flaunted her trim physique in a nude bikini as the family soaked up the sun on a fun-filled beach outing.

The former Miss Universe Australia accessorised the look with sunglasses, a pendant necklace and wrist watch. 

She had her blonde locks tied back into a bun and showcased her natural beauty with minimal makeup. 

Erin appeared relaxed and happy as she played with her children in the ocean.

The family holiday comes after Erin filmed SAS: Who Dares Wins in the Snowy Mountains in NSW last month. 

The new military-style reality show will see well-known personalities attempt to pass the selection process to join the Australian Army's elite Special Air Service.

Erin will be competing alongside celebrities including, former Bachelor Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins, 32, PR queen Roxy Jacenko, 40, and convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby, 43.

On Monday, the mother-of-two shared a naked selfie with a series of painful-looking bruises scattered across one of her arms, her ribcage and her chest.

Erin revealed she acquired the bruises when her 'jump out of a helicopter' went 'wrong' on the set of the reality show. 

'No, that's not dirt. It's bruising. (The strip of unbruised flesh is where my sports bra was!),' she captioned the photo. 

'Apparently water is just as hard as concrete when your jump out of a helicopter goes wrong.'
