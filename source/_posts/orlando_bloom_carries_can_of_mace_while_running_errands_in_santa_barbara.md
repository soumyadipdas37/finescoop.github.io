Orlando Bloom recently became a father again, when fiancée Katy Perry gave birth to daughter Daisy last month. 

And the British actor recently breathed a sigh of relief for his family, after Katy was granted a restraining order against her alleged stalker.

However Bloom still seems to be taking his personal safety very seriously, with the Lord of the Rings actor seen carrying what appeared to be a can of mace on his keychain.

Orlando put on a casual dad display Saturday in an oversized printed white t-shirt and a pair of short black running shorts, as he grabbed breakfast for the family in Santa Barbara. 

The 43-year-old finished the look with a black baseball cap, matching wayfarer sunglasses, a blue bandana face mask and white kicks. 

His outing came after fiancée Katy, 35, was granted a restraining order earlier this week against her alleged stalker William Terry.

William is believed to be homeless and living in a silver Buick sedan, as he's recently been harassing Katy and her family. 

According to court documents filed by the Last Friday Night artist, he's made 'death threats on social media,' including that he wanted to 'snap Orlando Bloom’s neck,' and he's even attempted to enter their home on a few occasions.

Stalker: Another hearing is set for October 8 to make the restraining order against William permanent, also protecting their entire immediate family

She detailed the last instance, which took place September 8: 'Terry jumped the fence of my home in the Beverly Hills area of Los Angeles. 

'Security ordered Terry to leave. When he refused he was placed under citizen’s arrest and then formally arrested for criminal trespass by the Los Aneles Police Department.'

Another hearing is set for October 8 to make the restraining order permanent, also protecting their entire immediate family.

It should come as a relief to the parents, as they recently welcomed their first child together last month.

Orlando and Katy introduced their bundle of joy to the world on Wednesday, August 26 via Unicef, for whom they serve as Goodwill Ambassadors.

Happy family: The proud parents wrote: 'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter' (pictured in September, 2018)

The humanitarian agency released a statement on behalf of the parents: 'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter.   

'But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was.'

The statement was posted to Unicef's Instagram, as well as Orlando and Katy's, accompanied with a sweet black-and-white photo of Daisy's hand holding mom and dad's fingers.

They used the opportunity to encourage donations to Unicef, adding: 'In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival. 

'By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your [heart emoji] can bloom with generosity.'

A source recently told ET Online that the happy couple 'can’t get enough of their daughter Daisy.'

Orlando told Jimmy Fallon just days before welcoming Daisy: 'I’m so excited to have a little Daddy’s girl. I hope she’s gonna love me as much as I love her. But that daddy-girl thing and that love of your life feeling is, I think, right around there.'
