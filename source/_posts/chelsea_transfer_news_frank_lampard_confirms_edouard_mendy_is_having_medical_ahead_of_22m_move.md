Edouard Mendy is currently undergoing a medical ahead of his £22m move to Chelsea from Rennes, Blues boss Frank Lampard has confirmed. 

The 28-year-old goalkeeper is set to sign a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge and will compete with under-fire keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga for the No 1 jersey. 

Lampard confirmed the Senegalese would be a Chelsea player subject to being given the all-clear following the medical test and is hopeful he will be able to feature as soon as this weekend, against West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday.

Frank Lampard praised the role of technical and performance advisor Petr Cech in the deal 

Former Blues goalkeeper Cech was instrumental in bringing Mendy to Stamford Bridge 

'As far as I'm aware, as long as he passes his test with us on Thursday and if that is negative then he should be okay to play,' Lampard said. 

The Chelsea manager also praised technical and performance advisor Petr Cech for his role in bringing Mendy to the club.

'Petr was important in that. It's a particular position and he has had a big say and was very instrumental'.'

Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga made another costly error during the defeat to Liverpool

The Chelsea manager was however sympathetic towards Arrizabalaga's situation following a string of high-profile mistakes, the latest being against Liverpool on Sunday.  

'I think competition is a regular thing at a club like Chelsea,' Lampard added. 

'The goalkeeper situation isn’t always as clear-cut as that. Kepa himself wants to improve his own performances.

The mistake came after Kepa let Leandro Trossard's shot squirm under him against Brighton

'It’s in everyone’s hands to push and develop to try and get in the team. I am not making any final statements at all in this minute.

'It is the hardest position because of the individual nature of it and mistakes get punished with goals. I understand that and as a manager I have to be sympathetic to that point. I am very aware of that.' 

Before the West Brom clash though, Chelsea entertain Barnsley in the Carabao Cup third round at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday evening.
