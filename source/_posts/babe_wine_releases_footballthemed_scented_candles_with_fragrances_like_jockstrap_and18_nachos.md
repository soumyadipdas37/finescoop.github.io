Football fans are sure to be missing attending games live and in person this season, and everything — the sights, the sounds, the smells — that come with it.

So Babe Wine and Ryan Porter’s Candier brand have teamed up on a line of limited-edition candles that smell like some iconic football scents.

The three stadium-scented candles are on sale now for $29 each and include 'Hashtag Field Goals,' '$18 Nachos,' and — really — 'Jockstrap'.

Interesting... The Jockstrap candle has notes of musk and male deodorant: 'While we can’t physically witness hot sweaty football daddies play in-person, we can still smell them'

The candles are being sold on drinkbabe.net for $29 each, or a pack of all three for $69.  

'BABE Wine is about drinking what you want, when you want — especially in 2020,' Chelsea Phillips, General Manager at BABE, said in a press release. 

'As football season kicks off without fans in the stands, we saw an opportunity to enhance the at-home game day experience through some pretty unique scents that’ll make you feel like you’re really there.'   

The scents certainly are unique. Hashtag Field Goals has a bright green label and smells like fresh-cut grass. 

Yum! There's an $18 Nachos candle, which smells just like the real deal but is, sadly, not edible

'Remember watching football IRL?' reads the description. 'We miss that game day energy and we REALLY miss leaving it allll on the field. With notes of freshly cut turf, this candle will have you yelling “TACKLE THAT ZADDY!” in no time.'

Then there's $18 Nachos, which smells just like the real deal but is, sadly, not edible. 

'Stadium munchies are dumb expensive,' says the description. 'And yet, we’d still drop major cash on the world’s shittiest nachos. That’s how much we miss football. Burn this candle whenever you’re overcome with fomo for live sports and processed cheese.'

Finally, the Jockstrap candle has notes of musk and male deodorant. 

Pumped! Sportscaster Erin Andrews celebrated the release of the new candles on Instagram today

Ready! She shared a funny new video spotlighting her pandemic game-day prep — which includes wine, snacks, and the new candles for ambience

'Feels like the stadium. But it’s your couch,' she wrote

'While we can’t physically witness hot sweaty football daddies play in-person, we can still smell them,' the description reads. 

'Light this candle and be immediately transported to the locker room of your favorite team. Did you hear that sound? They’re doing the sexy towel snapping thing.'

Babe Wine General Manager Chelsea Phillips said the two brands would cover moving costs for winner to help turn 'their break up into a glow up.'

'Speaking not from experience because #single, #findmeonbumble BUT — while living together during quarantine seems to be going great for some couples, it’s also resulted in some pretty awkward breakup stories, which inspired BABE x Bumble to step in,' she told DailyMail.com. 

'We’re partnering for the first time ever to help people move on from their exes (literally!) by covering moving costs to GTFO.

'BABE is all about maximizing fun, which is hard to do while sharing a bathroom with your ex,' she went on.
