Joe Swash has treated his family to a gleaming Volkswagen T6 camper van to create 'memories' in and travelled hundreds of miles to the north of England to pick it up.   

The former EastEnders actor, 38, purchased the pristine white van as a surprise for his girlfriend Stacey Solomon, 30, which she dubbed a 'monstrosity' on Saturday.

However Joe was 'chuffed' as he posed with the 2019 plate van from Southlands Motors in Whitley Bay, Newcastle upon Tyne, which can retail at around £45,000. 

Happy: Joe Swash treated his family to a gleaming Volkswagen T6 camper van on Friday to create 'memories' and travelled hundreds of miles to the north of England to pick it up 

Grateful: Joe was 'chuffed' as he posed with the gleaming 2019 plate van from Southlands Motors in Whitley Bay, Newcastle upon Tyne

Joe captioned the snap: 'Welcome to the family. Southlands Motor Company you guys did an amazing job thanks.'  

The doting father-of-two revealed on his Instagram on Friday that he was heading 'up north' to collect 'something very exciting', according to The Mirror. 

Joe, who shares one-year-old son Rex with Stacey, described how he couldn't 'wait to make some memories' as he showed his followers the 'new addition' to the Swash/Solomon family.    

Sweet: Stacey, who is also mum to sons Zachary, 12, and Leighton, eight, shared a heartwarming picture of her three boys and Joe in the back of the camper van

However Loose Women panellist Stacey was not exactly impressed with the van which she described as a 'monstrosity'. 

Speaking on her Instagram stories, she zoomed in on the motor from the upstairs window and said: 'Oh my God - what the hell Joe?' 

Joe, who is dad to son Harry, 13, from a previous relationship, added: 'Our new home on wheels mate - our new home do you like it?' 

The mother-of-three playfully pushed a beaming Joe onto the bed adding: 'When did you get that?'

Stacey captioned her post with a laughing face emoji and penned: 'When he gets something in his head...

'Is he actually joking... I was so tired last night I walked passed that monstrosity thinking someone had parked up and gone to the pub or something only to find out it's ours apparently.' 

Yet Stacey, who is also mum to sons Zachary, 12, and Leighton, eight, later shared a heartwarming picture of her three boys and Joe in the back of the camper van. 

Playful: Joe, who is dad to son Harry, 13, from a previous relationship, added: 'Our new home on wheels mate - our new home do you like it?'

She penned: 'Those faces though... I knew once he'd got this idea into his head it was inevitable...

'I didn't realise how soon though. Usually it takes him a week just to text me back so I thought it'd have years before he made this happen. 

'I am excited for him and the boys and our adventures. I love them so much and making memories with them is my favourite thing in the world. So here we go. 

'First memory they will have is the school run. Bye bye normal car hello camper.' 

The VW camper boats plush leather seats and vibrant blue LED lighting across the top of the window along with a mini oven and fridge. 

Southlands Motor Company shared a picture of Joe with his thumbs up alongside the van and described how the motor was 'custom built' to their requirements. 

The VW Camper dealership penned: 'So this happened today!!! Thank you so much to Joe Swash and Stacey Solomon for being an absolute pleasure to deal with!

'We hope you all enjoy your stunning new custom built camper van, and make sure you tag us along in all your amazing trips you have planned!'
