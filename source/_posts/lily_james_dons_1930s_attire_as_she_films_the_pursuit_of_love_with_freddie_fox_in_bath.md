Miss James, 31, plays the fearless, lovelorn Linda Radlett in the adaptation of Nancy Mitford’s 1954 novel, with Miss Beecham, 36, taking the part of her cousin and best friend Fanny Logan.

The three-parter follows the adventures and misadventures of the pair as they hunt for the ideal husband across Europe between the wars.

Other new images from the drama, directed by Emily Mortimer, show Miss James taking a stroll with Freddie Fox, 31, who plays Linda’s suitor Tony Kroesig.

Speaking about adapting the book, Miss Mortimer said: ‘It’s an outrageously funny and honest story, whose central character – the wild, love-addicted Linda Radlett – still reads as a radical.’
