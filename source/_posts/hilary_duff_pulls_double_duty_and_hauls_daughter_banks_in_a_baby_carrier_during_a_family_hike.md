She has been making good use of these past seven months of quarantine by spending more quality time with her family.

And on Sunday Hilary Duff kept up with that COVID-19 lockdown mantra by heading out on a hike with husband Matthew Koma, their daughter Banks, and son Luca from her first marriage to former NHL player Mike Comrie.

Looking to step up her workout, Duff pulled double duty during the outing in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles by hauling her nearly two-year-old daughter with a baby carrier that was secured on her back and shoulders.

Despite the extra weight on her back, the Lizzie McGuire star kept pace with her family dressed in black leggings and a white sleeveless t-shirt.

She also donned grey sneakers and wore a black baseball cap over her long blonde tresses that flowed to the middle of her back.  

Koma, a singer-songwriter who fronts the band Winnetka Bowling League, wore black shorts over grey tights with a military-green tank top and grey sneakers.

He also donned a red baseball cap and carried a pink backpack over his shoulders, which stored any go-to child needs, along with water and snacks.

Luca, eight, went with black shorts, a red shirt, a white and blue baseball cap and sneakers.

His adorable sister, 23 months, had on pink-patterned tights with a white shirt and her blonde hair pulled into a cute top ponytail.

All four of them wore protective masks when ever appropriate, but at times, when they weren't in the vicinity of any other hikers, they pulled them down off their faces.       

Multi-tasking: Hilary had her hands full for the day out

At one point, during an incline in their hike, Duff appeared to struggle with having  her little girl on her back and needed to take a quick break.         

Duff and Koma have been in a relationship since January 2017, which eventually led to them getting married in December 2019. 

The singer and actress had been married to Comrie for nearly five years when she filed for divorce in February 2015.
