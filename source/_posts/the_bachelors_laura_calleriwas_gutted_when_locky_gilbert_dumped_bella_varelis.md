Bella Varelis was left teary-eyed after Locky Gilbert dumped her for arch-nemesis Irena Srbinovska in the nail-biting finale of The Bachelor.

And on Tuesday, her fellow Bachelor housemate Laura Calleri revealed that she was just as upset over the hunky 31-year-old's choice. 

In an interview with Perth Now, the 24-year-old revealed that she and Bella, 25, were 'best mates' and that she was 'gutted' for her during the finale.  

A big support: On Tuesday, Laura Calleri (pictured) revealed that she 'bawled her eyes out' after Locky Gilbert dumped Bella on The Bachelor

'I was never actually that into him; just supporting Bella pretty much,' she said. 

'Bella is one of my best mates. I was pretty gutted. I actually sat at home and bawled my eyes out feeling for Bella.' 

During last week's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told Bella and Irena Srbinovska he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.

He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.

'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'

Going home: During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told Bella and Irena Srbinovska he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home 

As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave? I'm going.'

She later told producers: 'Who does that to someone? Who tells them they're in love with them and then... I just want to get out of here.'

After this emotional break-up, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena, telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.

And the winner is... Irena! After this emotional break-up, Locky professed his love for Irena Srbinovska, telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her
