Beatlemania didn't go out with the Sixties.

Keira Knightley has revealed her daughter, Delilah, has become 'obsessed' with The Beatles at the tender age of five — and is besotted with 78-year-old Sir Paul McCartney.

'It is really obsessive,' says the Atonement star, who is married to rocker James Righton. 'She knows all of the four films.

'I am a fan of The Beatles, but the films are not that great, but we watch them on a loop. Hard Day's Night — she knows all the words.

'Paul McCartney is her big one. Every time he comes on the screen she just screams.'

Who needs Netflix? While Prince Harry and Meghan are flush with cash from the television streaming giant, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are super-charging their Royal Foundation with a hat-trick of eye-catching appointments.

Not only have they appointed BBC newsreader Zeinab Badawi to be a director, I hear they've also recruited Alice Webb, who was in charge of BBC children's television and is now boss of DVD giant Eagle Rock Entertainment. 

Helping to give Prince William and Kate's charity a new global reach will be former foreign secretary William Hague, who will also be a director.

'William and Catherine are very much focused on their charitable efforts,' a friend tells me.

Fancy owning one of London's most spectacular party pads? I hear that PR supremo Matthew Freud, who inspired Matthew Macfadyen's character Tom in acclaimed U.S. drama Succession, is looking to sell his Primrose Hill home. 

Everyone from Tony Blair to Hollywood stars has been entertained at the property, which includes a courtyard patio that, at the press of a button, opens up to become a swimming pool.

The house is likely to be valued at more than £20 million, but Freud, who was married to Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, insists he's in no rush to sell, telling me he's 'not very actively' marketing it. 

Perhaps Macfadyen might put in an offer?

Under fire for blundering into U.S. politics, Prince Harry has at least won a vote of confidence back home from Boris Johnson. 

I hear the charity the Duke of Sussex set up to help injured former servicemen and women, the Invictus Games Foundation, has been awarded £57,000 by the Government's Office for Veterans' Affairs. 

'The Invictus Games have been a fantastic way of supporting our Forces,' a source tells me.

What should you do when the person you meet through a dating app turns out to be someone else entirely?

Saucy television chef Gizzi Erskine admits she had one such mix-up when using the members-only Raya. 'I thought I was going out with Orlando from The Maccabees,' says the daughter of the late Lord Erskine of Rerrick. 'I'd just read 'Orlando', and I was like, 'Brilliant!'

'I'd fancied him for years. I turned up and it was someone half my age from another band — who will remain nameless.'

Rather than playing it cool, she admits: 'I literally lay on the floor, p***ing myself in hysterics. I texted my friend saying, 'How do I get out of this?' I had a drink. He was very sweet.'

Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch might have detected something curious when an ambulance arrived at a family wedding yesterday.

Happily, it was an auspicious start to proceedings, as it was carrying the woman due to marry his brother-in-law.

Patrick Hunter, whose sister is Benedict's theatre director wife Sophie, wed Gemma Taylor, a fellow paramedic — which is what inspired the bride's unusual entrance.

Benedict and Sophie's sons, Christopher, five, and Hal, three, were pageboys at the ceremony at The Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham, South-West London. Due to Covid rules, the boys didn't attend the evening reception at a nearby hotel.

Benedict, however, made use of his thespian talents by delivering a heart-warming speech.
