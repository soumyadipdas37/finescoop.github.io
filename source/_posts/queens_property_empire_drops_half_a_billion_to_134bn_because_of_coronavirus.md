The Queen's land and property empire has fallen in value by £552.5million after a sudden drop in rental income from shops hit by coronavirus lockdown.

Regents Street and St James's in London as well as retail parks across the country are included in the Crown Estates. 

It has been revalued at £13.4billion in annual results published today - after a tough year for retail sales, reported the Guardian.

Figures also showed a profit of £345million in the year up until March 31, when the UK went into a nationwide lockdown to try to stem the spread of Covid-19.

The early profit, which was up 0.4 per cent from last year, suggested the value of the estates would have risen if not for the impact of coronavirus.

All profits are handed to the Treasury which then passes 25 per cent of the funds back to the royal family in the form of the Sovereign Grant. 

But the difficult financial year has left the Crown Estate making staggered payments to the Treasury to ensure it has enough revenue reserves to support itself.

The Crown Estates has so far collected 52 per cent of rents from retail tenants in central London and 53 per cent outside the capital this year.

The rental income from officers in central London in 88 per cent. 

Dan Labbad, the Crown Estate's chief executive, said the country's retail parks were slowly recovering.

'We've seen most of our retail and food and beverage come back and want to open where they are still trading.

'There have been a number of CVAs [company voluntary arrangements] and administrations,' he said.

Company Voluntary Arrangements involve coming to an agreement over how best to settle debts. This could include paying only a proportion of the amount that a company owes to creditors.

Mr Labbad said London's West End was 'slowly filling up again' following the Government's successful Eat Out To Help Out scheme. 

The Crown Estates' income comes from rents paid by a number of retail outlets across the UK. Other funds may come from interests in agricultural land and forests.

Shopping centres owned by the crown include: 

The Crown Estate owns virtually all of the UK's seabed to the 12-nautical-mile (22 km) limit.

Holdings consist of around 116,000 hectares (287,000 acres) of agricultural land and forests, together with minerals and residential and commercial property.

In 2002 The Crown Estate started a £1 billion investment programme to improve Regent Street. They are also investing £500 million in St James's, including a number of major redevelopments.
