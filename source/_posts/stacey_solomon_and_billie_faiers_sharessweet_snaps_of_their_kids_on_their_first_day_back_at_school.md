And Stacey Solomon and Billie Faiers led the celebrities marking their kids' first day back at school with heartwarming images on Instagram on Thursday.

The Loose Women panellist, 30, cried as she admitted she's 'drowned her sorrows with a cuppa' after her sons Zachary, 12, and Leighton, eight, left home, while the Mummy Diaries star, also 30, uploaded sweet photos of daughter Nelly, six, before she started year two.

Struggling to hold back her emotion, the singer - who also shares baby son Rex, 15 months, with partner Joe Swash - said: 'They're in, woo they're gone. I don't know if I'm relieved or what, such a weird feeling. 

'I'm going to have a cup of tea to drown my sorrows. I hope you're all OK. I can't stop thinking about everyone in lockdown - people without friends, single parents... I don't know how you did it. You smashed it.'
