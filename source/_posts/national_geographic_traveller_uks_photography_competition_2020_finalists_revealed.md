These photographs show just how stirring the best travel photography can be.

They have all been shortlisted in National Geographic Traveller (UK)'s prestigious Photography Competition 2020.

Launched in 2011, the annual contest seeks to find the UK's best new travel photography talent across four categories: cities, landscape, nature and people. This year judges sifted through more than 4,500 entries and whittled them down to a 12-strong shortlist - presented here. 

Among those making the cut is a stunning dusk shot of Prague, a dramatic image of a lion hunting in a sandstorm in Kenya and a mesmerising photo of Namib-Naukluft Park in Namibia. 

The category winners and the overall grand prize winner will be announced on Tuesday, August 25.

Pat Riddell, editor of National Geographic Traveller (UK), said: 'While the coronavirus pandemic has greatly affected our ability to travel, our desire to see the world is nevertheless undiminished. This year's competition is a window on the world we hope to explore again as soon as it's safe to do so, and is a reminder of the power and emotion that travel photography can capture. From spectacular wildlife to moving landscapes, the shortlist again demonstrates some of the UK's best talent behind the lens.' Scroll down to see the top picks from this year's contest...
