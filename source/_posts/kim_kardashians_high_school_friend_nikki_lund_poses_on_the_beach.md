Nikki flaunted her ample assets as the barely-there bathing suit that provided little coverage. Her tanned and sculpted tummy was on full display as the camera man worked his magic.

Nikki revealed that was excited to be back in the studio.

She told Better Days she was hopeful for a fresh start.

'It was the hope for better days ahead. I think that there is a lot of positive change for women that has happened in the past year as far as the #metoo movement,' she has said.

'Also, it was kind of an inspirational thing where I was like, “Wow, this is really cool, kind of like better days are coming up and I can see it.”

'It is hopeful,' the star added.

'There’s a lot of stuff that is going on in the world that is not so good and I was a little bit bummed about it,' she said at the time. 

'With all of the shootings [in schools], and how politically everything is upside down, crap that’s going on that’s not cool.

'I think we need more positivity.'

A California native, Nikki spent years honing her songwriting skills and teamed up with Rondor Music Publishing for her stint in the band Secret Mind, before going solo.  

In 2005, Nikki launched the loungewear line Eccentric Symphony.
