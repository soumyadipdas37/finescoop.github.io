She is in the middle of a flourishing romance with chef Emilio Vitolo Jr.

And Katie Holmes enjoyed another day out with her new flame on Friday. 

The actress, 41, and her new beau 33, were spotted grabbing lunch with Emilio's father, in addition to a romantic, hand-held walk through New York City.

Love is in the air! Katie Holmes and Emilio Vitolo were spotted taking in the autumn air during a romantic, hand-held walk through New York City on Friday 

All in the family: Holmes also enjoyed lunch with her boyfriend and his father, Emilio Vitolo 

Katie has already been seen at her boyfriend's father's restaurant Ballato before, and the trio looked quite comfortable with one another as they enjoyed hearty toasts al fresco at the famous eatery. 

Katie dabbed at her cheek with a napkin as she caught up with the boys, who sat opposite one another. 

In between bites of their food, Katie flashed a smitten smile towards her handsome beau.   

Three's company: Holmes and her beau enjoyed a hearty lunch 

That was good! Holmes returned to the restaurant with her plate in hand 

Once it was time to go, the duo picked up after themselves and left with Katie carrying a to-go bag upon her arm.  

The couple were then seen on a romantic walk through the Big Apple, enjoying the autumn air hand-in-hand. 

Katie's beautiful face was barely visible behind her blue face mask and stylish sunglasses.

She embraced the fall weather with a rusty red sweater, distressed jeans, button down shirt, and polka dot tie hanging over her neck. 

Yum! Holmes and her beau dug into their delicious plates

Charmed! Holmes flashed a smitten smile towards her new beau 

She's in! The actress looked comfortable as she shared a laugh with her lunch pals 

Meanwhile, Emilio cut a suave figure in his black button down coat, grey trousers, and leather shoes. 

The chef looked quite dashing with his black hair expertly slicked behind his head.

The new couple appeared content in each other's company as they walked silently through the busy city, at one point growing slightly closer to share a few words.

Katie got out her point using her hands, gesturing ever-so-slightly to express herself.

It's been only a few weeks since Katie and Emilio's romance came to light, and the smitten duo are not shying away from putting their love on display.

A source recently told People she 'keeps texting Emilio all day long and he loves it.'

'He can't get enough of her attention,' the insider noted, who claims Emilio is 'very charming' and 'flirty.'

The couple confirmed their romance with a hot and heavy make out session at Peasant Restaurant in Manhattan on September 6, where the actress sat on his lap while sharing passionate kisses. 

 DailyMail.com also revealed that Vitolo broke it off with his live-in fiancée Rachel Emmons, 24, via text when handsy photos of him and Holmes were first published, leaving the handbag designer shocked and forcing her to move back home.
