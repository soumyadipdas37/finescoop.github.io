Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign officially smashed American political fundraising records, raising $364.5 million in one month. 

The Biden campaign put out the August total Wednesday morning, after The New York Times reported Tuesday that the former vice president and the Democratic Party raised more than $300 million and then Bloomberg reported the total topped $350 million. 

President Barack Obama held the record for the best one-month haul, raising $193 million in September 2008.  

Vice President Joe Biden and the Democrats raised $364.5 million in the month of August, shattering American political fundraising records 

Joe Biden's fundraising haul comes the same week that many of President Donald Trump's television ads were taken off the airwaves, as his campaign is in a brief money-saving mode 

The Biden campaign said that $205 million raised in August, amounting to 57 per cent, came from online, small-dollar donations. 

Additionally, 1.5 million donors in August were first-time givers. 

The campaign reported that their donor base amounts to more than 4 million Americans.  

Biden announced the numbers to supporters Wednesday morning remarking, 'That figure blows me away.' 

'Even in a global recession, working families set aside some money to power this campaign, and a little bit added up in a big way,' he said.  

But he warned that Trump and the Republicans will be bolstered by 'outside, dark money.'  

'And you better believe they will pour it all into attacks and smears against me, against Kamala, and against our campaign,' Biden said.   

August marked Biden's announcement of running mate, Kamala Harris, a California senator who had run her own bid for president before dropping out in December. 

With the pick of Harris, Biden made history by adding the first woman of color to a presidential ticket. 

Later in the month, Democrats had their four-night Democratic National Convention, which was held virtually from studios around the country, as the coronavirus pandemic prevented delegates, party leaders and journalists from gathering in person in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 

The campaign previously announced it had raised $48 million in the two days following the vice presidential announcement. 

It also said it raised $70 million after the convention. 

The Times also reported that ActBlue, Democrats' main donation platform, reported raising $35 million alone on Monday, the final day of the month.   

Earlier Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that President Donald Trump had pulled most of his advertising from TV airwaves, as Biden recently outspent the incumbent by ten-fold.  

The Trump campaign has been burning through money almost as soon as donations come in. 

Biden, on the other hand, has a leaner campaign, allowing him to catch up to the long-held Republican and Trump financial advantage. 

The Trump TV ads were pulled, according to the AP, because the Trump campaign was trying to conserve money.  

At the beginning of the month, Biden and the Democrats had $294 million, while Trump and the Republicans started the month with $300 million.  

In July, Biden and the Democrats had raised $140 million, while Trump and the Republicans earned $165 million.     

The Trump campaign and the Republican National Convention's August numbers have yet to be released.
