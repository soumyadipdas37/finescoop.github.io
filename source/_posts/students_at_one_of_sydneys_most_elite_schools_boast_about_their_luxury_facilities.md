Students at one of Sydney's most exclusive private schools have shared videos boasting about a luxury '$50million gym and library with a harbour view'.

Sydney Church of England Grammar School, also known as the Shore School, sits in Sydney's North Shore.

Students recently uploaded a video to TikTok as part of a viral trend showing off the school's facilities.

The video, which has since been taken down, showed students looking out at views of the Harbour Bridge from the comfort of their library.

The video also showed the school's gym, which includes treadmills, stationary cycling bikes and weight-lifting facilities. 

The $33,000-a-year school sits on a eight-hectare block and features classrooms, lecture theatres and a 500-seat auditorium, according to the school's website.

There are cricket nets, as well as tennis and basketball courts, two squash courts and a 25-metre swimming pool and diving facilities. 

There are also boarding facilities and a chapel on campus as well. 

There are other incredible facilities at the $33,000-per-year school that weren't included in the video

The Shore School's student's video went viral, with other school children from across the country making similar clips to compare facilities. 

However, administration were not impressed with the video posted on TikTok.

A spokesman for the school told the Daily Telegraph the students involved were told to remove the clip as it breached the school's social media policy.

Students are allowed to use mobile phones on campus, and footage shot inside of the school is also banned from appearing online.

Those involved were told not to do it again. 

David Shoebridge, NSW Greens MLC, called the footage 'deeply offensive'. 

'Students can see how unfair and unbalanced school funding is,' Mr Shoebridge said.

'It's just extraordinary how most politicians can't.' 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Shore School for comment.
