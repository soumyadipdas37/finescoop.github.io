A Colombian student who died when a car allegedly hit her motorcycle has been remembered as 'playful and happy'. 

Maria Alejandra Landazabal Contreras was waiting at a red light in Moorebank, south-west Sydney, when a Honda HR-V allegedly struck her from behind about 11.35pm on Saturday.

Ms Contreras moved from Colombia to Sydney earlier this year and was staying with host Rosa Rutte in Engadine, where she helped care for Ms Rutte's twin daughters. 

'She made an instant connection with my daughters and reminded me of myself when I came to Australia as a student,' Ms Rutte told The Daily Telegraph. 

'She had a kid's soul, she will play with my daughter hide and seek, she do their nails and their hairs (sic), she prepared delicious desserts.' 

Ms Rutte said Ms Contreras's death was 'still very surreal for all of us' saying she had her whole life ahead of her. 

'She had so many dreams to fulfil. She loved travelling, she was planning to travel through Asia while she was studying in Australia.'
