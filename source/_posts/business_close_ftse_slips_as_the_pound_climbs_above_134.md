The Footsie finished deep in the red as a mixture of a firmer pound and a poor performance from banking and energy stocks has hurt the index. 

The FTSE 100 closed down 1.7 per cent, or 101 points, at 5,862 - the lowest point since the middle of May. The FTSE 250 also closed in the red, falling 1 per cent, or 183 points, to 17,604. 

The pound rose above $1.34, hitting its highest against the dollar since December 2019, mostly thanks to a weaker greenback.

In economic news, the UK manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest rate for over six years in August, as companies restarted operations following the pandemic.

The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) recorded a score of 55.2 in August, from 53.3 in July. Above 50 indicates an expansion.

In company news, shares in FTSE 250-firm Dunelm were in demand after the homeware retailer reported a jump in sales, helped by pent-up demand following store closures and its summer sale.

Shares in Saga also rallied today after the company confirmed reports its former boss, Sir Roger De Haan, is returning to the boardroom and bringing £100million into the company with him. 

Elsewhere, broadcaster ITV is set to be relegated from the FTSE 100 in today's reshuffle after its shares suffered from the drop in advertising spend since the pandemic took hold. Value retailer B&M is tipped to take its place in the corporate top flight.

This was the lowest close since the middle of May. Engineering giant Rolls Royce was the biggest faller, tumbling over 14 per cent to 206p.

The FTSE 250 also closed in the red, down 1%, or 183 points, at 17,604.

David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets UK, sums up the day:

The FTSE 100 finished deep in the red as a mixture of a firmer pound and a poor performance from banking and energy stocks has hurt the index. 

Diageo, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Ashtead and Unilever all derive a large portion of their revenue from overseas, so the push higher in the pound usually hits the stocks. The declines in Royal Dutch Shell, BP, HSBC and Lloyds are weighing on the British benchmark too. 

Mining stocks such as Fresnillo, Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Group are some of the best performers on the FTSE 100. The well-received manufacturing data from China overnight has lifted metal prices and in turn the mining companies.

Continental European equity markets are mostly in the red too, but the DAX 30 is showing a small gain as the German government now predicts the economy will shrink by 5.8% in 2020, which was an improvement on their previous prediction of a 6.3% fall in output.

Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com adds:

Why is the FTSE so embattled? For one, we have seen a really strong rally for the pound since the March lows were made.

Two, the FTSE 100 is a dinosaur, full of rather lumbering old-world stocks with precious little growth to offer. The FTSE 100 is a very good proxy for the global economy, which we know is on its knees. And if not exposed to the global economy (non-sterling earners) then they are fully exposed to the UK economy (eg Lloyds, RBS) which is doing worse than peers, we think. You could say the FTSE has gone ex-growth.

 

Three, there is no tech to speak of, which is where the real money has been made this year. 

 

Finally, the FTSE has traditionally been a good dividend payer but the pandemic has led companies to slash payouts to investors, which has frightened many income investors away.

Shares in Saga rallied today after the company confirmed reports its former boss, Sir Roger De Haan, is returning to the boardroom and bringing £100million into the company with him.

The move was warmly welcomed as shares in the insurance and travel company rose 95 per cent as markets opened. But the excitement subsided, leaving them up nearly 38 per cent.

Britain slipped down the global broadband speed table, going from 34th place in 2019 to 47th this year - a result of a slow pure fibre network rollout, experts say. 

The Worldwide Broadband Speed League gathers data from more than 570 million speed tests in 221 countries or territories around the world to create a comparison.

The UK has fallen 13 places because it hasn't been able to increase its broadband speeds as fast as other places due to a slower fibre optic network rollout.

Shares in video conferencing company Zoom have jumped 40 per cent today after revenues more than tripled in the second quarter, coming in way above expectations.

Revenue rose 355 per cent to $663.5million, above analysts' average estimate of $500.5million, as the company benefits from the new working-from-home regime.

At $2.2trillion (£1.6trillion), Apple is valued more than the entire FTSE 100 index of UK-listed companies, which is valued at around £1.5trillion.

Apple has had a stellar year so far, with shares up almost 80 per cent since the beginning of the year.

The tech giant has managed to become more valuable the the UK bluechip index after completing a 'stock split' - which makes its pricey shares 'more accessible to a broader base of investors'.

The split divided each share worth around $500 to four, making each shares worth around $125.

Today Apple shares are up 2 per cent at $131.77.

Wall Street has opened higher, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq hitting a new record high, helped by a rise in Apple shares and upbeat manufacturing surveys from China and Europe.

The Nasdaq is up 0.9% at 11,883.

The S&P 500 is up 0.3% at 3,510.

The Dow is up 0.05% at 28,445.

Dunelm has reported year-over-year sales growth of 59 per cent and has outperformed initial expectations.

The home furnishing retailer says sales have been boosted in the last two months as a result of pent up demand following store closures and growth in its home delivery services.

The company, which said that sales grew by 24 per cent in August, added it had also performed well in its summer sale and had enjoyed positive footfall in its mainly out-of-town superstores.

The pound has hit new eight-month highs, rising above $1.34, mostly thanks to a weaker dollar, which has been falling in the wake of the Federal Reserve's new policy that suggests US interest rates will remain at record lows for the foreseeable future.

The pound's strength is contributing to drag the FTSE 100 lower, as most of the companies listed on the index report their profits in dollars. 

The FTSE 100 is currently down 1.3 per cent at 5,886. The pound is 0.7 per cent higher against the dollar, with £1 buying $1.347 on currency markets.

David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets UK, sums up the day so far for the Footsie:

The FTSE 100 is underperforming as banking and oil stocks are weighing on the British equity benchmark. 

HSBC, Lloyds and Barclays are in the red, while BP and Royal Dutch Shell are lower too. The fall in the London market would be even worse if it wasn’t for the mining sector, which is being assisted by the stronger-than-expected manufacturing data from China. 

The Caixin survey of Chinese manufacturing for August increased to 53.1, its fastest rate of growth since 2011, which has helped Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Group.

Low-cost airline Wizz Air is the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 after it said it has ditched plans to fly more planes next quarter.

Wizz said it expects to fly at roughly 60 per cent of capacity, down from a previous target o 80 per cent as new travel restrictions are imposed in Europe.

Shares in the FSE 250-listed Hungarian company have fallen more than 9 per cent to £35.16.

It said:

Further capacity reductions remain a possibility and as a result, Wizz Air may park parts of its fleet throughout the winter season to protect its cash balance.

Scottish broadcaster STV has made a loss of £4.9million before tax in the six months to the end of June, from a £9.1million profit a year earlier, as advertisers fled despite a rise in audience.

The company saw its TV audience figures soar 12 per cent a people tuned in during lockdown, and growth continued even as lockdown slowly lifted.

But, like many other media companies, a bigger audience has not translated into more money, as advertisers have pulled their commercials from screens and newspapers.

STV said advertising revenue had dropped by 20 per cent, with its regional sales - down 18 per cent - faring better than its national ad revenue, which was down 23 per cent.

Shares have risen 7 per cent to 227p.

Warren Buffett has made a $6billion bet on Japan just days after the resignation of the country's long-standing prime minister.

With the successor to Shinzo Abe yet to be announced, Buffett's investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway bought a 5 per cent stake in each of Japan's biggest trading houses. Berkshire is now one of the biggest shareholders in Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Marubeni and Sumitomo. 

On his 90th birthday, the Sage of Omaha said he wants to hold on to the investments for the long term, and that he may increase his stake in each of the five trading houses up to 9.9 per cent.

The coronavirus pandemic has made home buyers even more reliant on the 'Bank of Mum and Dad' to raise a deposit, research suggests - but the amount being dished out has slumped compared to last year.

Almost one in four purchases this year will be backed by parents, family and friends, according to a survey by insurance giant Legal & General and the Centre for Economics and Business Research.

The FTSE 250 is down 1% at 17,595.

The number of mortgages approvals for house purchase continued recovering in July, reaching 66,300, up from 39,900 in June, the latest data from the Bank of England show.

It means approvals are now 10 per cent below the pre-covid level of 73,700 in February.

Approvals for remortgage are little changed compared to June, at 36,000 and remain 30 per cent lower than in February.

Dave Atkinson, SME and Mid Corporate UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank, commenting on the latest manufacturing PMI, says: 

Another rise in the index offers some hope that momentum is beginning to build behind a V-shaped recovery. But the caveat still remains, despite consecutive months of improvement, that this growth comes from a very low base. Factories are making up for lost time with most skipping the traditional summer shutdown. Across our client base we’re seeing production back to above half the usual levels and hearing anecdotal evidence of a rise in domestic and export orders, providing further encouragement. Food producers supplying grocers are still reporting strong sales, but the boost they enjoyed in lockdown appears to be wearing off as consumers return to more normal shopping habits. 

Unfortunately, there is no escaping the fact that aerospace and automotive – two of the UK’s most important manufacturing industries – have been severely weakened by the pandemic, affecting both the larger groups and their supply chains. It may be years before they recover the lost ground.

The recovery of UK factories continued to gather pace last month, but companies continued to cut jobs, according to the latest manufacturing PMI survey.

The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to a 30-month high of 55.2 in August, up from 53.3 in July.

Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit said that while the recovery of the manufacturing sector continued, the jobs situation remained 'worryingly weak':

The recovery of the UK manufacturing sector gathered pace in August. Output expanded at the fastest rate in over six years as new work intakes rose to the greatest extent since November 2017, led by an upturn in domestic demand and signs of recovering exports. Business optimism also remained encouragingly robust and close to July's recent peak.

However, companies report that the current bounce is mainly driven by the restarting of manufacturers’ operations and reopening of clients as COVID-19 restrictions continue to be relaxed. Backlogs of work fell at an increased rate, hinting at spare capacity, and the labour market remains worryingly weak, with job losses registered for the seventh straight month. The downturn in employment may have further to run as the government’s furlough scheme is phased out unless demand rises sharply. 

Given the fragility of demand and uncertain outlook, both in terms of COVID-19 and Brexit, policymakers may struggle to prevent a 'surge-then-slump' scenario from developing.

🇬🇧 UK Manufacturing PMI rose to a 30-month high of 55.2 in August (July: 53.3), amid the sharpest rise in manufacturing output for over 6 years. However, job losses were seen for the seventh month in a row. Read more: https://t.co/DJQKOLioiR pic.twitter.com/ydXO9gwnct

While Germany and Italy’s factories saw stronger growth last month, Spain and France struggled.

Eurozone Manufacturing #PMI posts at 51.7 in August (July: 51.8) to signal another modest recovery in the region's good-producing sector. Stronger growth in some countries (incl. Germany and Italy) contrasted with stalled growth in others (France, Spain). https://t.co/5gqKmuomsh pic.twitter.com/sumMH1Vr2X

Dunelm shares are on the rise today after the home furnishings retailer reported strong sales in the past couple of months.

The retailer said sales were up 59 per cent in July and 24 per cent higher in August as a result of pent up demand following store closures during lockdown and the timing of its summer sales.

It said its performance so far this year has been ahead of its initial expectations.

Shares in the company are up 5 per cent at £15.06.

Rishi Sunak is offering employers a £1,000 grant for every furloughed employee they keep on when the job retention scheme winds down at the end of October.

But fewer than one in five business leaders who have furloughed staff say these payouts will actually help them keep hold of their workers, according to a poll carried out by the Institute of Directors.

IAG and Rolls Royce are the biggest fallers, while miners like Fresnillo and Antofagasta are among the biggest risers.

Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex, comments on what's dragging the Footsie lower:

Given that the market is digesting the strongest Chinese Caixin manufacturing PMI since 2011, the UK index should be higher.And there was evidence of that over in the Eurozone, where the DAX jumped 1% and the CAC climbed half a percent, striking 13070 and 4970 respectively.Yet despite the support of its miners – which saw gains of 0.6% to 2.5% as gold and copper rose – the FTSE dropped 0.4%, sitting at its lowest price for a month.The index hasn’t been helped by the pound’s continued rise against the dollar, the greenback suffering in the aftermath of last week’s dovish Jackson Hole address from Federal Reserve head honcho Jerome Powell.Though it only added another 0.2% on Tuesday, that increase pushed cable to $1.341 for the first time since it spiked towards $1.35 in the middle of last December.

 It’s an incredible turnaround from the sub-$1.15 lows struck in mid-March, made all the more remarkable considering it comes against a backdrop of Brexit angst, with Michel Barnier and David Frost holding emergency talks this Tuesday to try and find a way forwards. And they might struggle to – Barnier reportedly ‘won’t even discuss’ fishing rights, one of the key sticking points between the UK and EU.

IAG shares are in the red again today, down 6 per cent, making it one of the biggest fallers on the Footsie.

BA is on the sixth month of flying at less than 20 per cent of its schedule. It has been burning through cash at a rate of £20million a day.

Parent company IAG made a £3.8billion loss after exceptional items in the first half of this year.

Below Ruth Sunderland asks, can BA fly again?

... helped by upbeat manufacturing data from China.

But the Footsie is in the red.

Marks & Spencer is starting its long-awaited tie-up with Ocado today, as the latter ends its 20 year long relationship with Waitrose.

M&S's full range of 6,000 food products is available to buy from Ocado from today.

Meanwhile, most major supermarkets are now offering same day – and in some cases, next hour – deliveries, are the days of doing the 'big shop' in large stores over?

The pound has shot up above $1.34, the first time this happens since December 2019.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 is only slightly higher at 17,803.

Overnight, Asian markets made gains after Chinese data showed that the manufacturing sector continued to recover after the coronavirus pandemic, expanding at the fastest pace in 11 years.
