She has wowed viewers with her impeccable outfits on Britain's Got Talent. 

And Amanda Holden exuded elegance once more as she left the Global Radio studios after recording her Heart FM show in central London on Thursday.  

The radio host, 49, nailed autumn style in a blue jumper and pleated midi skirt as she sashayed through the city centre and headed home.

The television judge perfectly matched her baby blue jumper with a pair of patent stilettos. 

Amanda carried a stylish black clutch bag and wore 50s-inspired black shades to protect her eyes from the September sun. 

The-mother-of-two styled her long bob in a natural straight 'do and opted for peach-toned make-up to highlight her complexion.

Amanda's outing comes after it was revealed she has ended up with a £6,000 luxury rabbit pen for her bunnies at her south-west London home.

The TV personality shares the property with her record producer husband of 12 years, Chris Hughes, and their two daughters Lexi, 14, and Hollie, eight. 

The Britain's Got Talent host has made the most of her daughters' old playhouse by transforming it into an incredible comfy home for her two rabbits Princess and Beatrice. 

Amanda is thought to have spent £6,000 to up-cycle the space for her beloved pets who can now enjoy their own porch and bunk beds, reports The Sun.

A source said: 'Amanda loves these rabbits, and they're treasured members of the family. It's only right they live like starlets.' 

And a representative for Amanda told MailOnline: 'The playhouse was purchased 6 years ago for Lexi and Hollie to play in, but they’ve outgrown it now.  

'Converting it into a home for the rabbits has cost just £200. Rather than dismantling it, Amanda has simply recycled it!'
