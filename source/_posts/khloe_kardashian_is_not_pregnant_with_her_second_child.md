Khloe Kardashian is not expecting a second child, according to insiders at E! News.

Fans began to speculate the Good American co-founder had a bun in the oven after she shared photos wearing a flowy dress during a recent visit to the beach.

But there is no merit to the rumors according to E!, who went on to explain how Khloe and baby-daddy Tristan Thompson are 'on the same page' about their family.

Nothing to expect: Khloe Kardashian insiders assured E! News that the star is not pregnant after photos of her in a flowy dress sparked baby rumors online

The reality star and basketball player - who raise two-and-a-half-year-old daughter True -  'are both on the same page and are great at co-parenting together,' the source said. 

Khloe and Tristan also appear to have reconciled romantically, seen enjoying a cozy hike together last week.

Scott Disick all but confirmed things were back on for the duo back in August while commenting on a sultry bikini shot of Khloe on Instagram.

Revealing his insider knowledge, Scott tagged the NBA player to call him 'a lucky man!'

Focusing on now: Sources said that Khloe and on-again boyfriend/baby-daddy Tristan Thompson are 'on the same page' about their relationship and family plans. They're seen with two-and-a-half-year-old daughter True above

 Interesting: Scott took to the comments and wrote that Tristan 'is a lucky man,' seemingly confirming their relationship

Tristan had to earn back Khloe's trust after the pair split in early 2019 following word that the Cleveland Cavalier had hooked up with little sister Kylie Jenner's former BFF Jordyn Woods.

Back in July, People insiders said the couple were 'giving their relationship another try' as Thompson continued to show he's a changed man.

'Tristan is working hard to prove himself and has been a great dad to True,' the source said. 

Now, Khloe appears to be ready to take a step back from the spotlight to focus on her family and her relationship.

End of an era: On Tuesday Khloe and her famous sisters Kim and Kourtney announced the end of the family reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians

On Tuesday she and her famous sisters Kim and Kourtney announced the end of the family reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

The Kardashians told fans: 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up With The Kardashians' while thanking everyone who has supported throughout their 14 years and 20 seasons.

Khloe offered a personal message in the caption of the post, saying:  'I am so grateful and thankful to everyone who has supported us and been there through it all. 

Sister act: The Kardashians told fans 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up With The Kardashians' while thanking everyone who has supported throughout their 14 years and 20 seasons

Way back when: The show debuted all the way back in 2007, seen in a season one promo above

She went on: 'I’m too emotional to fully express myself at the moment. My sappy post will come soon. 

But the youngest Kardashian sister explained that it was time for a new chapter, writing: 'Change is hard but also needed at times❤️��❤️�� I love you all. Thank you for the memories!'

While the show - which debuted in 2007 - has undoubtedly had an extraordinary run, its more recent series have suffered poor ratings.

In April this year, it was reported that viewership had sunk to 871,000 viewers, making that episode the 4th lowest rated episode ever.

Peak moment: At its peak, KUWTK earned E! its most-watched day ever, when 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries - the episode, Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event - Part 2, aired in 2011

However, as the viewership has dipped, the family's social media presence has only grown stronger - which could explain why fans are flocking to their Instagram Stories to get their fix, instead of the television show.

There have been 12 spin-off series on E! including, Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Kourtney and Khloe Take the Hamptons, Khloe and Lamar, Sex with Brody, I Am Cait, DASH Dolls, Life of Kylie, Rob & Chyna, Revenge Body with Khloe Kardashian and Flip It Like Disick.
