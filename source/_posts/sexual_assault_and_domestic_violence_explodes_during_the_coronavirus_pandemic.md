Sexual assault and domestic violence has soared by up to 60 per cent in parts of Australia during the coronavirus pandemic, while other crimes have dropped.

Areas of regional New South Wales, western and southern Sydney saw a significant increase in the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research's latest report.     

The quarterly review showed that crime patterns were significantly interrupted in April with theft dropping, but sexual assault had risen by 9.4 per in comparison to June 2018.

Sexual and domestic assault has almost tripled across parts of regional New South Wales (Shoalhaven pictured), southern and western Sydney during the COVID-19 pandemic

 Idyllic locations like the Hawkesbury region (pictured) recorded a 32.7 per cent increase in domestic assault. Sexual assault increased by 9.4 per cent overall in New South Wales 

Sexual assault increased by 24.4 per cent in Western Sydney's Blacktown council area, encompassing suburbs like Toongabbie, Rooty Hill, and Mount Druitt.

The Sutherland Shire, with suburbs like Cronulla, Miranda and Caringbah also saw a staggering 59.2 per cent increase in sexual assault.      

Domestic assault was also revealed to have a major upward trend in Sydney.  

The northern Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury region saw domestic assault increase by 32.7 per cent.

Domestic violence was up 9.9 per cent across Parramatta in Western Sydney.   

Favoured holiday destinations in regional New South Wales were also impacted by the troubling increase. 

Sexual assaults in the Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven region skyrocketed with an increase of 63.9 per cent. 

Well-known Sydney areas in Blacktown and Sutherland also reported a shocking increase in the number of sexual assaults (pictured, commuters wearing masks in Sydney)

The idyllic wine region of Hunter Valley saw nearly 20 per cent more sexual assaults. 

This also increased by 33.7 per cent in the Illawarra region south of Sydney.  

Blacktown - 24.4 per cent increase in sexual assault

Sutherland - 59.2 per cent increase in sexual assault

Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven - 63.9 per cent increase

Hunter Valley - 20 per cent increase in sexual assaults 

Illawarra region - 33.7 per cent increase in sexual assault 

Murray Shire - 25 per cent increase in domestic assault 

Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury region-  32.7 per cent increase  

Parramatta - 9.9 per cent increase in domestic assault 

The Murray Shire, in southern NSW, saw domestic violence assaults increase by 25 per cent.     

BOCSAR Executive Director, Jackie Fitzgerald, said the continuing increase in reported sexual assaults was a worrying trend.

'It appears that at least some of the increase in sexual assault is related to an increase in secondary and mandatory reporting of child sexual assault. 

'We will continue to closely monitor trends in this offence,' he said. 

Other crime patterns decreased during the pandemic and saw considerably fewer break-ins, car theft and retail theft across New South Wales. 

Four offences have trended down over the last two years: robbery without a weapon - down 12.6 per cent - steal from motor vehicle - down 12.1 per cent - steal from person - down 25.4 per cent - and malicious damage to property - down 5.4 per cent.

Attorney General and Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, Mark Speakman, said the NSW Police Force was ready to support assault survivors during the pandemic. 

'As citizens cooperate with social distancing directions, self-isolation and quarantine, there is an associated risk that domestic and family violence will increase. 

'Victims have a right to live a life free from violence every single day. When it's safe to do so, I urge them to contact our hard working frontline services for support,' Mr Speakman said.
