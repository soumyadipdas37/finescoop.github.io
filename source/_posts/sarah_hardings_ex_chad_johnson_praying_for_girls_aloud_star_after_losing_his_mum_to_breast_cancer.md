Sarah Harding's Celebrity Big Brother ex Chad Johnson is 'praying' for the Girls Aloud singer after he lost his mother to breast cancer.

The US reality star, 33, who became romantically involved with Sarah, 38, on the Channel 4 show in 2017, told MailOnline he knows how 'rough' breast cancer can be after his mum passed aged 63 following a seven year long battle with the disease.

In an exclusive interview, Chad, who's currently living in Los Angeles, said: 'Sarah always reminded me of my mum and my mum went through the exact same thing.'

He continued: 'It sucks, I am hoping and praying the absolute best for her because I know how difficult the situation can be.

'My mum had breast cancer and it got into her blood and her liver. I know what Sarah is going through, I mean, I have seen it from day one to the very end and I just hope that she can recover.

'I know how rough it is, once you go there there's no real coming back. You're always worrying about it. I took care of my mum the whole time.'

Sarah took to social media last week to tell her fans that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year and she was recently told it had advanced to other parts of her body.

In lockdown, Chad was asked about his relationship with Sarah during an Instagram Q&A where he said she went 'off grid' and he hadn't spoken to her. 

The Bachelorette star believes Sarah's absence from social media is so that she can 'maintain who she is' and not become 'the sick person' after his mum Peggy was private about her condition.

He said: 'Some people don't want anyone making a fuss and I think that's why Sarah's avoiding being on social media. She will want to maintain who she is and not become the sick person.

'I know my mum was very private and she didn't want anyone to see her or talk to her or know her condition because she wanted people to see her as healthy and beautiful.

'My mum passed aged 63 right before my first show on The Bachelor. She went through it for seven years, I'm sure this is something Sarah and I spoke about.'

Chad, who came fifth on Celebrity Big Brother while Sarah won the show, confirmed the pair haven't been in contact since their 2017 split, but he's planning on messaging her once he's mustered up the courage.

He said: 'I'm definitely going to reach out to her but I've been teetering around it.

'I don't want to come off unauthentic like "I hope you're well" I want it to be like I am actually checking on her. But I can imagine she's getting 1000s and 1000s of messages.

'It sucks that our relationship disappeared. Our agents told us not to do anything or to be seen and that we needed to hide, so we hid and I went home… but then I was like wait, why the f*** did we hide?

'No one had any updates of what was going on with us and it wasn't going to work long-distance.'

Sarah told her followers last week that she had recently received the devastating news that the breast cancer had advanced to other parts of her body.

Speaking on Instagram, she said: 'I'm currently undergoing weekly chemotherapy sessions and I am fighting as hard as I possibly can.

'… My amazing mum, family and close friends are helping me through this, and I want to say a thank you to the wonderful NHS doctors and nurses who have been and continue to be heroes.

'I am doing my very best to keep positive and will keep you updated here with how I'm getting on. 

'In the meantime I hope you'll all understand and respect my request for privacy during this difficult time.'

'I am here for you': Sarah's former Girls Aloud bandmates including Kimberley Walsh, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl and Nadine Coyle have all publicly offered their support (pictured in 2004)

Following her announcement, Cheryl, 37, Nadine Coyle, 35, Kimberley Walsh, 38, and Nicola Roberts, 34, have all publicly offered their support to their former Girls Aloud bandmate. 

Cheryl posted a broken heart emoji while Nadine said: 'I am here for you all the way and always will be.'

Speaking this week, Kimberley said: 'I am completely devastated, it's been really, really though, but speaking to her a lot helps and keeping that contact. 

'She knows we're there for her every step of the way, she's a strong girl and I love her so much.'
