People who grew up in conservative households are sharing their 'glow-up' transformations since they left, showing how how much better they look since they've been able to embrace who they really are.

According to BoredPanda, the trend was started by @Cherryemojigirl, a 19-year-old from Utah who went from a straight-laced Disney-loving cheerleader in high school to a punk rock queen with two-toned hair, neon nails, and a nose ring today.

'Did anyone else grow up in a really conservative household?' she asked. 'So you were never allowed to express yourself through your appearance? So the minute you graduated and went off on your own you just... '

It turns out, this was the reality for quite a lot of people, especially among the 10.1 million viewers who watched her video.

Soon, others were responding with videos of their own, showing how they've changed their clothes, hair, makeup, and even their gender since growing up — and are so much better off for it.
