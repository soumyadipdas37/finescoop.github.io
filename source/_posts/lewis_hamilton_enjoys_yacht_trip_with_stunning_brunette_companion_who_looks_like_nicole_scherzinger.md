Lewis and Nicole called time on their on and off eight year relationship in 2015.

Speaking about their split during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, Nicole revealed: 'I don't see anything negative.

'I think it's quite natural when people separate and go their own ways and you just have to be adult about it and just always wish the other person happiness, success and love like sincerely and I do.'

When asked whether they still stay in touch, the Poison hitmaker - who first started seeing the race car driver in 2007 - was frank in her admission. 

She added: 'Yeah we don't, like, talk. I think that he is the best driver since Ayrton Senna and I think that he's probably going to win this year and I only wish him happiness and success.'

They may have been dating for less than a year, but Nicole and Thom are clearly devoted to one another and divide their time between her LA pad and London.

The 26-year-old brunette beauty claimed that Formula 1 world champ Lewis pursued her four years ago, after parting ways with the former Pussycat Doll though she insists they're now just friends.

RT quotes her as saying: 'We had different types of relationship. At a certain period of time it was romantic. He was courting me. 

'But then this relationship evolved into friendship. I live in Russia and he lives abroad. We just became friends who can message each other and send holiday greetings.'

Viktoria reportedly revealed that the pair met in Barcelona four years ago, before exchanging direct messages on Instagram, though they're not just friends.

The model has previously claimed that she's been messaged by countless footballers and athletes on Instagram in the past, including Juventus ace Cristiano Ronaldo.  

 As for Lewis, in recent months he appeared more focused on his racing career, as well as maintaining his physical fitness, as was shown in recent snapshots.

The star said he had been channelling his energy into exercise during lockdown and urged others to follow suit for mental health.

He wrote on Instagram: 'With all that is happening in the world, my only get away is to train and channel the emotions and energy into building my body stronger.

'This has been the best training period I’ve ever had, I can’t stop and I won’t!

'Staying active both mentally and physically is so important today, I want to encourage those of you out there to keep working out even if it’s only for 20 minutes. Every little helps.'
