Showtime has released a new trailer for its upcoming miniseries, The Comey Rule, painting President Trump as 'a mob boss' and referencing the infamous 'Golden showers' allegations against him. 

The trailer, released on Thursday, is the latest sneak peek at the highly-anticipated drama series based on former FBI director James Comey's memoir, A Higher Loyalty.

The show, which features actor Brendan Gleeson as the president and Jeff Daniels as Comey, is scheduled to air in two parts beginning on September 27.

The limited series follows Comey through the challenges he faced throughout his role as FBI director under Trump's presidency, amid the investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In a new trailer for Showtime's The Comey Rule released on Thursday, President Trump is painted as a 'mob boss' during the investigation into Russia's interference on the 2016 election

The upcoming miniseries, featuring Jeff Daniels as James Comey, is based on the former FBI director's 32018 memoir, A Higher Loyalty 

The new trailer opens with Trump speaking to Comey in the Oval Office as  he threatens to 'go after reporters' spreading 'fake news'.

The series has been promoted as a political drama/thriller however, it appears to have to take a few comedic jabs at the president.

In one scene, Gleeson's character is seen telling one of his aides: 'He's got people thinking I like golden showers!' 

The line is reference to the salacious allegations that emerged from an unverified dossier in the Russia investigation in 2016. 

In his book, Comey alleged Trump wanted him to investigate the allegation and to prove it was a lie.  

He also claimed the president asked for his 'loyalty' during the investigation - a conversation that is also depicted on screen. 

Another scene also references Trump's love for McDonald's, showing an egg McMuffin being delivered to his desk.

According to the network, Comey's memoir serves as just one source for the series, along with 'more than a year of additional interviews with a number of key principals.'

The Comey Rule was described as, 'an immersive, behind-the-headlines account of the historically turbulent events surrounding the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath, which divided a nation.'

The network description also clarified that this event series is 'not the biopic of one  man,' but is the story of 'two powerful figures whose strikingly different personalities, ethics and loyalties put them on a collision course.'

The description even calls Russia's interference in the 2016 election a, 'deep and unprecedented penetration into American politics'.

The first night of the two-night, four-hour event will explore the earliest days in the Russia investigation and the FBI investigating Hillary Clinton's emails, and how they impacted election night when Trump shocked the world.   

Holly Hunter is also set to portray Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, William Sadler will play Michael Flynn, and Peter Coyote as Robert Mueller.
