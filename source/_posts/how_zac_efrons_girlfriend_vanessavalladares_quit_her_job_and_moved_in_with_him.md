It sounds like the plot of a Hollywood rom-com: waitress meets a famous actor, falls in love with him, and quits her job to live in his mansion. 

But this is reality for Zac Efron's new girlfriend Vanessa Valladares, who has reportedly moved in with the actor after quitting her waitressing job.  

Zac, 32, reportedly met Vanessa, 25, in July when she was waiting tables at the General Store café, located in New South Wales's trendy coastal town of Byron Bay.

The pair were photographed at the time looking very friendly as they chatted and swapped phone numbers at an outdoor table. 

It is believed Vanessa, an aspiring model, has since handed in her resignation and is shacking up with the High School Musical star, who has a net worth of approximately $25 million. 

Zac is said to be residing at a property in Belongil Beach while he looks for a property to purchase in Byron Bay.

Last week, The Daily Telegraph reported that Zac recently 'inspected and put in an offer' on a beach-side property in the coastal hub, but unfortunately was 'outbid at the last minute by a rival buyer.' 

While the exact location of Zac's current home is unknown, Realestate.com.au reported in June that he may have been renting Baywatch at Wategos, which is part of Byron Bay Luxury Homes.

The publication also speculated the Baywatch star was residing at the Raes hotel -  an exclusive boutique retreat where penthouse rooms cost up to $2,000 a night.

However, The Sunday Telegraph has previously alleged that Zac was staying at The Boardwalk, a Byron Beach Retreats property located in the coastal suburb of Broken Head.  

In June, the publication claimed Zac loved his stay so much that he'd even made an inquiry about buying the property.
