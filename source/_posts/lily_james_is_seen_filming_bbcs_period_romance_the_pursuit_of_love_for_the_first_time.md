Lily James has been spotted on-set for the first time filming BBC's latest adaptation of Nancy Mitford's sweeping romance novel The Pursuit of Love.

The actress, 31, was transformed into a 1940s beauty as she filmed at the Dinton Park and Philipps House in Salisbury for the series which tells the comedic story of an upper-class English family coping with life between the First and Second World War. 

Lily will star alongside Fleabag's Andrew Scott, Emily Beecham and Dominic West in the series which will focus on two cousins with increasingly different views on love and their dream partner, causing friction during a time of political unrest.
