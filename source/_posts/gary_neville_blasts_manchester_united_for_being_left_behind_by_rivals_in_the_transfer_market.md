Gary Neville has taken a swipe at former club Manchester United and has described their inability to make signings this summer as 'appalling' in comparison to their top six rivals. 

United have made one acquisition since the end of the extended 2019-20 season with Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek joining from Ajax.

But Neville, who played for United between 1992 and 2011, insists this is the 'easiest' transfer market in Premier League history to get deals done and yet United are still being caught cold.

United vice-chairman Ed Woodward has six days left to add to the side before window closes

Thee 45-year-old wrote on Twitter: 'It's appalling that in this market which is probably the easiest in PL history to get transfers done that United haven't done more yet! 

'They must get Ole a CB , LB and Forward pre deadline! The others are managing to get things over the line why not United!' 

The transfer window for Premier League sides opened on July 27 and given it closes at 11pm on October 5, time is fast running out for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to bolster his squad.

Neville took to Twitter to vent his frustrations where he said rivals are doing better than United

Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho has been United's top target but no deal is agreed

United made Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho their No 1 target this summer but have so far been thwarted in their pursuit of the £108m England international. 

A move for a new left back saw Sergio Reguilon, who joined Tottenham, overlooked and a deal for Porto's Alex Telles has reportedly stalled over the valuation. 

In Neville's opinion United need a new centre back and a striker, as well as a left back, but chief executive Ed Woodward has left himself with little time to get deals done before the deadline shuts for the summer.  

More to follow.
