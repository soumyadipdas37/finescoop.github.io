A year on from her first ever trip Down Under, rapper Cardi B is still making waves in Australia.

Her X-rated collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion, titled WAP, has reigned atop the ARIA Singles Chart for the past six weeks.

The song's lengthy stint at No. 1 is a record for the female-led hip hop song.

The triumph broke the record previously held by Salt-N-Pepa's 1992 classic, Let's Talk About Sex, earlier this month. 

The music video has attracted more than 317million streams on Spotify since it was released on August 6.

The figure does not include the more than 225million views on Youtube. 

The raunchy song even spent two weeks at number one on America's Billboard Hot 100 - becoming the first female rap collaboration to debut in the spot.

It also received the most first week streams ever, and has been so popular TikTok users have mashed up the clip - altering its sound and the vocals - to share a variety of other versions online.

WAP has become a viral sensation - partly due to a cameo from Kylie Jenner which was widely parodied online.

It gained further traction when conservative pundit Ben Shapiro awkwardly read out the songs lyrics during an episode of his podcast.

WAP was shot in West Hollywood, CA, in the middle of COVID-19 lockdowns.   

Cardi forked out $100k on coronavirus testing to ensure everybody was safe throughout filming.

The achievement comes as Cardi B, 27, files for divorce from Offset, who is the father to her daughter Kulture Kiari Cephus, 2. 

'I didn't wait until he cheated on me again. I didn't wait [for] another controversy with him being involved. I decided to leave,' the singer, whose full name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, told her OnlyFans on September 23.

'If I wanted to stay, I could have stayed. I decided to leave.'
