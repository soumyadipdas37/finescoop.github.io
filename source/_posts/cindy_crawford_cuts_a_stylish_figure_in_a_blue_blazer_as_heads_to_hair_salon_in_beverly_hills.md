Not many women can make a simple jeans and blazer ensemble look this priceless.

But uber-beauty Cindy Crawford was seen doing just that in Beverly Hills, California on Thursday, when she was spotted on the way in to a hair salon in the 90210.

The ravishing brunette, 54, wore a lovely pale powder blue blazer for the outing, over a dainty white silk blouse with artful detailing along the low V-neck bust.

The Freedom 90 superstar completed her ensemble dark blue hip-hugging flared jeans, and open-toed nude sandals. 

On her shoulder Cindy carried a large tan suede purse.

Crawford accessorized with the faintest touches of jewelry, including a silver chain and bracelet.

She donned chunky brown wayfarer sunshades.

The runway queen had her highlighted auburn hair down, at one point bringing her hand up to move it out of the way.

The sighting comes days after the supermodel was seen with her family enjoying a Mexican getaway.

Cindy, along with husband Rande Gerber, is parent to young model Kaia Gerber, 19.

The clan was seen with Kaia and her new flame, Euphoria actor Jacob Elordi, living it up in an upscale Los Cabos resort earlier this week.  

Cindy and Rande, 58, soaked up the sun alongside their daughter, whose latest relationship comes after previous romances with the likes of Pete Davidson and Wellington Grant.
