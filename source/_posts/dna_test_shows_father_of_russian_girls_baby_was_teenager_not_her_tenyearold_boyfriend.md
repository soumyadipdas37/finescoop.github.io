DNA tests on a baby born to a Russian schoolgirl who had claimed she was made pregnant by a ten-year-old boy show the father was in fact a teenager she later accused of rape, say law enforcement sources.

Darya Sudnishnikova was 13 when she became famous after insisting on primetime TV that she was made pregnant by her prepubescent boyfriend Ivan Vanya.

Ivan - now 11 - was with her as she departed a clinic in Krasnoyarsk with baby Emelia, born on August 16.

The couple smiled at the hospital door flanked by their mothers.

But reports in Russia citing law enforcement say police DNA tests on her daughter Emelia have shown the father is a teenage boy who Darya, now 14, later accused of rape.

The boy was believed to be 15 at the time, now 16.

After doctors and experts claimed that it would be biologically impossible for Darya to be made pregnant by Ivan, she alleged that she was raped.

She invented the story about Ivan because she was too embarrassed to admit the rape on a stairwell in her home town Zheleznogorsk, in Krasnoyarsk region, she said.

Darya - who has become a teenage social influencer with 474,000 followers - said in May this year: 'It is a painful issue for me.

'I could not move away for a long time and the pain still remains in my soul.'

To a question 'Who is the father?', she posted: 'It was a rape. I cannot tell how it happened, because it is painful to recall.

'For the long time after that accident, I could not do anything, it was scary and lonely at the same time.'

She described the attacker as 'very fat for his age. And very tall.'

News agency NGS24 reported citing law enforcement sources that a DNA test with the baby showed that the father was the teenager 'who the schoolgirl had accused of rape'.

TVK channel carried a similar report.

In recent postings, Darya has told her almost 400,000 followers about the painful contractions and birth. Pictured: Darya and Ivan together with the new baby

The Russian Investigative Committee has not commented on the case.

The schoolgirl posted a video showing her with her daughter, who she says she is raising alone.

'I keep losing weight, now I'm 57 kilograms,' she said.

'That's why I just do not eat, I have time to eat only late in the evening.'

Replying to comments she posted: 'First of all I do not care about my body, whether I am fat or not, chubby or not, slim or not.

'I do not eat because I have no time.'

The baby 'doesn't let me go, that's all.

'And no one else can sit with her, my mum is ill, father at work, brothers... well there is nothing to say about them.'

She previously revealed that her mother Elena Sudnishnikova, 35, the baby's official guardian, is suffering from cancer.

She earlier posted that Ivan 'does not live with me, he stays overnight sometimes.

'At 16, he will take over the fatherhood, but it depends on how everything goes on between us.'

Ivan's mother Galina Fyodorova, 28, said when Darya first claimed her son made her pregnant after the pair locked themselves in a bedroom: 'I believe my son that he is the father…

'I understand that he himself maybe doesn't realise what happened.'

Darya said that in keeping with Russian tradition, she will not show the baby's face until she is 40 days old.
