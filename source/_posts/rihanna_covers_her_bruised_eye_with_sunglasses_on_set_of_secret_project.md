Rihanna returned to work in LA on Sunday night after being involved in an accident on an electric scooter which left her with a bruised eye. 

The singer, 32, was seen on the set of a secret project and wore sunglasses to cover up her injuries after the scooter was said to have flipped and hit her in the face.

She was easy to spot, despite wearing dark glasses and a safety mask amid the coronavirus pandemic.
