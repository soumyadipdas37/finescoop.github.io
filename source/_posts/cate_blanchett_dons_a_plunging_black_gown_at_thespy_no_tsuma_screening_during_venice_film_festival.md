She is currently acting as the Jury President for the 77th annual Venice Film Festival. 

And Cate Blanchett was very much the leading lady as she exuded glamour while attending the Spy No Tsuma (Wife Of A Spy) screening on Wednesday.

The actress, 51, stunned in a plunging black floor-length gown as she led arrivals on the glitzy red carpet.

Cate's stunning black dress featured sequin detailing, a long train and a chunky black belt which cinched her in at the waist. 

The Thor: Ragnarok star proved less is more with her accessories, opting for a gold bangle and simple gold earrings to complete her look.

The beauty accentuated her features with a simple make-up palette, while her blonde locks were styled in soft waves.

Joining Cate on the red carpet was fellow actor and jury member Matt Dillon, who looked dapper in a black Blazer and T-shirt paired with cream trousers.

Matt, 56, put on an animated display as she smiled and waved while walking down the carpet. 

Also in attendance was jury member Ludivine Sagnier, who looked amazing in a black mini dress.

She boosted her height with towering black suede platforms, while she carried her essentials in a black handbag.

Looking good: Cate cut a glamorous figure from all angles

Cate's outing comes after she revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'. 

Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor. 

'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.'

Cate is heading the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.

'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she added of her thoughts on the matter.

'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.'

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

According to Variety, when the Film Festival unveiled its official selection in late July, the 'unprecedented inclusion of eight female-directed titles within the 18-film roster was heralded as welcome progress for an event that has come under fire in recent years for scarce representation of female filmmakers.'

Cate was chosen to head the jury back in January, making her the third woman in four years to hold the role.
