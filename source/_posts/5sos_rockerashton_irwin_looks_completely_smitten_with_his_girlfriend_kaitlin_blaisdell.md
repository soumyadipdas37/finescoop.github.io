They have been dating for almost three years.

And 5SOS rocker Ashton Irwin and his girlfriend Kaitlin Blaisdell looked completely smitten as they stepped out in Los Angeles over the weekend.

The couple cuddled up as they went for a stroll in the city sunshine.

Both wore coordinating activewear - with Aston in a pair of black leggings under baggy shorts teamed with a T-shirt, and Kaitlin showing off her slender figure in tight red tights and a white singlet top.

The fashion blogger had her bright green hair up in a high ponytail and both wore protective face masks.

The pair visited a local cafe where they held hands and gazed adoringly at each other over the table.

Ashton and Kaitlin were first pictured together in October 2017 in Los Angeles. At the time, she was described as a 'mysterious female friend'.

Around a year later, they were seen grabbing coffee the morning after 5SOS had performed a sell-out show at LA's Greek Theatre.

Kaitlin is a fashion blogger originally from Sugar Land, Texas. She currently lives in California.

Ashton was previously in a relationship with America model Bryana Holly, but it's believed they split sometime in 2016.

After moving away from their pop punk roots in recent years, 5SOS have found success with more contemporary-sounding tracks, like Youngblood and Lie To Me.

The group - consisting of Ashton on drums, singer Luke Hemmings, bassist Calum Hood and guitarist Michael Clifford - formed as teenagers in Sydney in 2011.
