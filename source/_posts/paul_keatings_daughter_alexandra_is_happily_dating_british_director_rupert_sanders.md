Former Prime Minister Paul Keating's daughter Alexandra is dating British film director Rupert Sanders.

According to The Daily Telegraph, their relationship was confirmed following the unveiling of a portrait by Sydney artist Oliver Watts - which featured both Alexandra and Rupert - which was entered in this year's Archibald Prize. 

Oliver, who is a friend of the pair, called the image 'Alexandra Keating and Rupert Sanders on a Yacht in Sydney Harbour.'

It is reportedly based on a boat trip out in Sydney's Rose Bay earlier this year, where he joined the director and the former politician's daughter.  

He spoke highly of the pair to the publication and explained that the painting was 'a tender conversation piece of a couple'. 

Oliver added that: 'She is happy that Rupert is her boyfriend.'
