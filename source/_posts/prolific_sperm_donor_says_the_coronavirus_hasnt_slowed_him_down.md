A prolific sperm donor with 150 children worldwide has fathered a further six babies during lockdown after claiming COVID restrictions haven't slowed him down.

With five women currently pregnant with 'Joe Donor's' unborn children, and one already having given birth this summer, the 49-year-old, from Vermont, is on target to impregnate 10 women this year.

Joe, who conceals his real name, has spent the majority of lockdown in Argentina after getting stuck there while donating his sperm - but the singleton is now in London and already set to meet five women this week.

Thanks to Facebook and recommendations, Joe says he has been as busy as ever since March and hopes more British women in need of sperm will get in touch now they know he's in the country.

Joe, who has unprotected sex with scores of women and claims to not make any profit from his donations, has previously admitted he is on a mission to impregnate as many women as he can, with 2,500 kids being a long term goal.

He said: 'I have about 150 kids worldwide but there's currently five women pregnant with my children and one already born.

'Coronavirus hasn't slowed me down and I feel busier than ever. I love seeing photos of the babies when they're born as a lot of them do look like me.

'I don't financially gain from providing my sperm to women, I just enjoy helping people. Luckily I run a few online businesses so I'm always available and can provide sperm whenever they're ovulating.

'I had travelled to Argentina to provide sperm to a few women who had contacted me online but I ended up getting stuck there until international flights resumed a few weeks ago.

Thanks to Facebook and recommendations, Joe (captured with some of the children he's fathered) says he has been as busy as ever since March

'I'm now in the UK for a few weeks and hope to help as many people as possible fall pregnant.'

Joe has travelled across America, Argentina, Italy, Singapore, The Philippines and the UK donating his sperm.

He said: 'I have babies all over the world and although people always worry over incestual issues, that has never happened. I aim to donate my sperm for as long as it works which could be until I'm in my 90's

'I started donating sperm in 2008 and have fathered on average 10 children per year. I have always said I wouldn't father more than 2500 but that would technically be impossible unless I live until the age of 250.

Joe offers both sexual intercourse and artificial sperm insemination - he claims about 50 per cent of his children are a result of having sex.

He added: 'I offer both options and although the natural way has a higher success rate, I do understand that it's not for everyone.

'Some of the women are lesbians and would not want to have sex while others are married but their husband's are infertile.

'There's not a single charge for the "sperm pot" as I do just enjoy making the world a better place. Some women do offer to help with travel expenses if they live far away. I always feel great when I know there has been a birth.'

Joe opts to have yearly medical checks to ensure he's practising as safe as possible.

He adds: 'I have a health check at least annually but if a woman requests more frequent testing, I will have another check on demand.

'There's always a risk as what I'm doing isn't regulated but women have checks during pregnancy too so they'd soon find out if they'd contracted a sexually transmitted disease, which has never happened.'

Joe is hoping to head back to his hometown after his UK trip but says he's happy to travel anywhere in the world to donate his sperm.

He added: 'I'm contacted by women all over the world via Facebook or email. I don't mind travelling as I can work wherever I need to in the world.

'I'm hoping that as lockdown eases in some parts of the world again that it'll be easier to travel more frequently.'
