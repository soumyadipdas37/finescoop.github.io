She brushed up on her beautician skills earlier in the day as she visited beauty training centre Cosmetic Couture Clinic in Manchester.

And after a long day of studying, Lauren Goodger treated herself to some dinner at Menagerie Restaurant & Bar in Manchester on Thursday evening.

The former TOWIE star, 33, caught the eye as she slipped into a sophisticated puff-sleeve blouse, teamed with wide-leg satin trousers.

Earlier this month, Lauren revealed in New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame. 

She explained: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.

'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me. 

'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".' 

The TV star claimed her mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father, who started his 'own life', from the age of four.

Lauren recently broke down in tears as she detailed her first therapy session in a candid Instagram video.

Reflecting on her past, the Bethnal Green native became emotional as she detailed her anxiety battle. 

Declaring she wants to be 'the best version' of herself, she insisted she'll share her experience with at-home counselling with her fans every week in a bid for them to discover 'the real Lauren'.
