People are reminiscing on childhood by sharing nostalgic photos of clothing and household items popular in the last century.

The conversation started on the Facebook page of New Zealand radio station Canterbury FM, where a post asked followers to share memories of iconic objects that show their age.

Dozens remembered a set of wooden bowls found in hundreds of thousands of kitchens during the 1970s, with different sizes tailored for snacks, fruit and dips.

'Oh my god, the wooden bowl. My great aunt is still using it - it doesn't break,' one woman said.

'Back in the day these were used at parties for chippies and finger food. Talking last century now!' added another.

A third said her grandmother still displays the iconic bowl on a shelf in her kitchen.

Others shared pictures of vintage Tupperware containers and leggings with 'stirrups' stitched onto the cuffs, designed for feet to slip through.

Stirrup trousers were all the rage for women from the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, with a 1985 column in Cincinnati Magazine declaring the style was 'being touted as the wardrobe basic of the year, and everybody is buying them'.

One man posted a screenshot of an ET talking doll released in 1982 with the caption: 'I'm this old.'

A woman shared a photo of a 1980s stainless steel drink container which she said is 'still in use today', while another posted about a miniature shaver specially designed for cutting children's hair at home. 

Many remembered this vintage style of Tupperware, which is now sold on online marketplaces like Etsy for considerably more than it originally cost

One man remembered these 1960s 'clackers', plastic balls tied to a string designed to be knocked together for children's entertainment

'Our boys would head for the hills when they saw this coming out,' she remembered.

'A razor blade on each end depending on how short you wanted it.'

Another posted pictures of 1970s-style cutlery, including a knife with a deep beige handle.

A woman tagged her friend, saying: 'I still use one of these every day, yours and mine was a wedding present to my mum and dad.'

One man shared a photo of vintage 'clackers', which are plastic balls attached to a string that can be knocked together for children's entertainment.

A product description of the toy - which was popular in the 1960s - promises prospective owners that they will become 'the master of the playground'.
