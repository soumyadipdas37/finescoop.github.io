Lyon manager Rudi Garcia has said he won't stand in Memphis Depay's way if Barcelona come calling for the Dutch forward.

Ronald Koeman is believed to be very keen in signing the 26-year-old who he knows well from his time as the Dutch national manager. 

The new Barcelona coach believes Depay would be a suitable replacement for Luis Suarez and the club believe they can sign him for just £17m, as there is only one year left on his current deal.

Garcia has acknowledged the rumours and has opened the door to his possible departure.

He told Telefoot: 'I read the Catalan press this morning. They talk about Memphis, but they also say that Luis Suarez is not gone.

'There was also a small left-footed player (Lionel Messi) who wanted to leave but who ultimately stayed - so there may not be room to take another player.

'Memphis is a fantastic player and if he can make the season with Lyon, we will only be stronger.

'But like many of my players, if they have the opportunity to play in a club built to win the Champions League, and he's met a lot of them last season, I will personally take him in my car.'  

The 26-year-old has impressed during his time at Lyon where he has scored 57 goals in 139 appearances, helping the club to the Champions League semi-finals last season after beating Juventus and Manchester City.

Depay has started the 2020-21 season brightly with Lyon, as he scored a hat-trick in his side's 4-1 win over Dijon last weekend to get their Ligue 1 campaign off to the perfect start.

The Dutch forward played a crucial part in Koeman's time as Holland manager, which ended with his arrival at the Nou Camp. 

Barcelona have also been linked with the capture of Depay's international team-mate Georginio Wijnaldum, with the Liverpool man also having just one-year left on his current deal. 

Depay would be seen as a replacement for Suarez, who has been linked with a move to Juventus.
