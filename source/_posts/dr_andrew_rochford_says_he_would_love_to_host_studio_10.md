Dr Andrew Rochford is being touted as a likely candidate to anchor a new-look Studio 10 alongside Sarah Harris.

And on Tuesday, the 41-year-old TV presenter addressed the speculation during an interview with Nova 96.9's Fitzy & Wippa.

Radio host Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli tried to catch out Andrew by congratulating him on the new job, even though Channel 10 hasn't publicly confirmed anything yet. 

'My name is thrown around for a lot of things': Dr Andrew Rochford told Fitzy & Wippa on Tuesday he would 'love to' host Studio 10

Andrew stayed coy, prompting co-host Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald to say: 'Your name has been thrown around...' 

'My name is thrown around for a lot of things,' Andrew interrupted. 'But usually they don't end up in the headlines!'

'Would you do it, Roch?' Wippa then asked. 

'My goodness, I'd love to do it. Just give me a chance,' the doctor replied breezily, before rattling off a list of shows he'd also love to host.

Following a round of job cuts last month, Studio 10 will be switching from a panel format to a two-person format, like Channel Seven's The Morning Show.

TV Blackbox reported on August 17 that Andrew was 'the most likely person' to assume the role of male anchor alongside Sarah Harris.

The industry website noted that he had been featured on Studio 10 several times in recent weeks and was considered a safe and uncontroversial choice.

The doctor, who made his TV debut as a contestant on Nine's The Block in 2004, joined The Project in 2010 as a panellist. 

He was later promoted to fill-in host after the departure of Charlie Pickering.

Experience: The doctor, who made his TV debut as a contestant on Nine's The Block in 2004, joined The Project in 2010 as a panellist. In 2018, he hosted Channel 10 game show Pointless, which was cancelled the following year

Axed: Last month, Channel 10 announced that 25 of its stars were being sacked as part of a cost-cutting measure, including newsreader Natarsha Belling (left) and legendary weatherman Tim Bailey (right)

In 2014, he was hired by 7News as a medical reporter, but returned to Channel 10 in 2018 to host the game show Pointless, which was cancelled the following year. 

Channel 10 announced last month that 25 of its stars were being sacked as part of a cost-cutting measure.

Studio 10 has been hit particularly hard, with outspoken panellist Kerri-Anne Kennerley and newsreader Natarsha Belling being made redundant.

Let go: Australian TV legend and Studio 10 host Kerri-Anne Kennerley was also among the 25 stars axed by the network
