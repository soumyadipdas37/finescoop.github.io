Kim Kardashian captured her 187 million Instagram followers' attention on Saturday with a sensual, unique photo shoot. 

In addition to sharing a snap of two juicy pomegranates sliced open on her white marble counter top, the reality star posed up a storm in a tiny minidress. 

'Soooo good,' the 39-year-old KKW Beauty mogul captioned a series of shots, which commenced with an snap of just the fruit and ended with her throwing peace signs.

Surrounded by lush foliage, the mother-of-four held a plucked pomegranate from a nearby tree and closed her eyes. 

As Kim showcased her famous curves in a plunging frock, she appeared to be peacefully taking in the fresh air and breathtaking view of the ocean. 

The reality star appeared to be posing at the Malibu beachfront property, valued at $100 million, that her family have rented for the summer. 

While soaking in the sunshine and warm air, she kept on hand behind her glossy raven locks and bent her right knee slightly to one side.

While one of the trees cast a shadow on her face, the star's red and green floral garment showed plenty of her sun-kissed skin. 

In her third shot, the barefoot beauty put on a very busty display, while seated on a wooden panel with her toes pointed. 

As her dress hovered above her toned upper thighs, she pursed her plump pout into a duck face and showed off her expertly-applied face of make-up.

Within two hour hours of sharing the slideshow, Kim amassed close to 600,000 likes and more than 4,000 comments.

Her longtime pal and self-professed culinary expert Jonathan Cheban commented his own nickname, 'Foodgod?' 

Meanwhile on her shapewear company's Instagram account, she could be seen stripping down to a white SKIMS bodysuit to celebrate the brand's upcoming one-year anniversary.

'To celebrate our 1 year anniversary on September 10th, we’re dropping new Solutionwear™ styles and this new color inspired by your feedback and requests!' the SKIMS account captioned a picture of her laying on a bed. 

The entire room, including the bed's pillows and bedspread, was plastered with sensual images of models wearing SKIMS underwear. 

As she simmered in the barely-there leotard, she made direct eye contact with the camera.
