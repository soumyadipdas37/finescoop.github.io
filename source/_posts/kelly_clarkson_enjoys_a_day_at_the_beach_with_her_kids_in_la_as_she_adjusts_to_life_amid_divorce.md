Kelly Clarkson enjoyed a rare beach day with her children after admitting her life has been 'a little bit of a dumpster' amid divorce from estranged husband Brandon Blackstock.

The 38-year-old singer protected her skin from harsh sun rays as she played in the sand with daughter River, six, and son Remington, four, in Manhattan Beach on Sunday afternoon.

Kelly revealed last week that she's having some difficulty navigating new terrain after legally separating from Blackstock in June.

The original American Idol sported a maroon shirt with a high neckline and sleeves rolled up to her elbows.

Waves broke along the shore as she walked in the water barefoot and wearing grey Nike drawstring leggings.

Kelly kept her blonde tresses covered underneath a wide-brimmed hat and shielded the bright sun from her eyes with over-sized sunglasses. 

Remington and River appeared to be having a swell time playing in the water with their mom by their side.

Earlier this year, Kelly announced she had legally separated from her husband of seven years. 

She is requesting joint legal and physical custody of their children; Kelly is not seeking custody of Blackstock's children from a previous marriage: Savannah, 18, and Seth, 13. 

Kelly also asked for spousal support and for the former couple's prenuptial agreement to be implemented. 

During an interview last week, the Daytime Emmy Award winner mentioned she's leaned on friends and family amid the difficult time.

'I mean, it's no secret. My life has been a little bit of a dumpster,' she told Sunday TODAY host Willie Geist.

'Personally, it's been a little hard the last couple months. I've been talking to friends that have been through divorce. I don't know how people go through that without having some kind of outlet because it is the worst thing ever for everyone involved.'

Clarkson is making sure her emotions are noted in her upcoming album, which is set to be released in 2021.

'This next record will probably be the most personal one I've ever released,' she said. 'And the whole record is basically every emotion you experience from the beginning of a relationship to the end of what it is now or where it is now, and it's been very therapeutic for me.'
