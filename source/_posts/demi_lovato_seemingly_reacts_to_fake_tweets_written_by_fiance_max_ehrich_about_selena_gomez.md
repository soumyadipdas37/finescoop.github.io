Demi Lovato took to Instagram on Sunday to seemingly debunk a slew of viral screenshots that showed rude tweets made by her fiance Max Ehrich, 29, in 2015. 

'It's really sad when people FAKE images to put women against each other. If women have conflict that's between them NOT YOU,' began the 28-year-old pop star in her passionate rant.  

In the 'fake' tweets, Max allegedly wrote that Lovato's former best friend Selena Gomez, 28, was 'prettier' and more vocally gifted that her.

FAKE: Demi Lovato took to Instagram on Sunday to seemingly debunk a slew of viral screenshots that showed offensive tweets made by her fiance Max Ehrich, 29, in 2015

In her Instagram Story posts, Demi appeared to passionately challenge the validity of the past tweets and she went as far as to urge 'tabloids' to write about 'more important sh*t.'

'Secondly, don't y'all have more important s**t to write about in 2020??? I challenge any tabloid that dares to type my name to mention Breonna Taylor and the face that her murderers still haven't been arrested. WRITE ABOUT THAT,' she wrote. 

Lovato went onto say that although people creating gossip about her is 'hella rude,' she 'get[s] it' because it is entertainment for many.

'I don't wanna look at what's really happening in the world either but WE HAVE TO. Yes, it's easier to tear apart celebrities and their relationships because 2020 suck and scares the sh*t out of us all but it's only gonna stay terrifying until we address it all and WORK ON SOLUTIONS TOGETHER,' explained the Camp Rock star.

Knock it off: 'But on the other hand, if you're aren't 13 years old trying to grasp the reality of right now, put on your adult underpants and write about what actually matters. Please,' concluded Demi, who got engaged to Max in July

Despite being enraged, Lovato said that she had 'compassion' for those who may be attempting to 'distract themselves' by doctoring tweets and get a rouse out of people.

'So while on one hand I understand have compassion for those who are so horrified at the reality of 2020 that they gotta distract themselves with doctored images in order to not focus on how bad these times are.

'But on the other hand, if you're aren't 13 years old trying to grasp the reality of right now, put on your adult underpants and write about what actually matters. Please,' concluded Demi, who got engaged to Max in July.

Really sad: 'It's really sad when people FAKE images to put women against each other. If women have conflict that's between them NOT YOU,' began the 28-year-old pop star in her passionate rant; Max and Demi pictured on Instagram

One of Max's fake tweets read: 'Hahaha selena gomez and demi are cute together [sic] but boy if you think demi is prettier…you're WRONG!'

While another, which did not mention Lovato by name, seemingly proved that he favored Selena over Demi in terms of music, as well.

'There's a female singer that screams so much, that's why my girl S is better than you know who,' tweeted Max, allegedly.

Selena Gomez is, clearly, a touchy subject for Demi, being that the pair have endured a rocky friendship since rising to fame on Disney Channel in the mid-2000s.

Lovato opened up about their crumbling friendship in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in May.

'When you grow up with somebody, you're always going to have love for them. But I'm not friends with her, so it felt….I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best,' she explained.
