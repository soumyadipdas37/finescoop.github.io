Chelsea have given Christian Pulisic the club's No 10 shirt after Willian moved to London rivals Arsenal, according to reports.

Pulisic enjoyed a strong debut campaign at Stamford Bridge after arriving from Borussia Dortmund, scoring 11 goals and producing 10 assists in 34 matches in all competitions last season.

And according to The Athletic, the American international has since been handed the No 10 jersey in west London - which has been worn by many famous names down the years.

Willian: 2019-20

Eden Hazard: 2013-14 - 2018-19

Juan Mata: 2011-12 - 2013-14

Yossi Benayoun: 2010-11

Joe Cole: 2003-04 - 2009-10

Willian joined Arsenal on a free transfer earlier on in the summer window, having spent seven years at Chelsea.

The Brazilian had inherited the No 10 shirt from Eden Hazard before the beginning of last season when the Belgian winger joined Real Madrid in a mega-money deal.

But after moving to north London, it's now Pulisic's time to don Chelsea's shirt number - which has also been worn by the likes of Joe Cole, Juan Mata and Mark Hughes.

After shining last season in his new environment following his move from Germany, many have viewed Pulisic as Hazard's successor at Stamford Bridge under Frank Lampard.

Pulisic tormented defences at times last season and will be hoping to continue in the same fashion when Chelsea start their 2020-21 campaign.

The Blues, who secured a Champions League spot after finishing fourth last term, take on Brighton away in their opening match of the Premier League season on Monday night.

And the Athletic also report that Pulisic is in line to feature at the Amex StadiumÂ after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered in the FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal.
