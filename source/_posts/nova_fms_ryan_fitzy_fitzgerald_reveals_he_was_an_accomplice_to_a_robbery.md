Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald has revealed he was unwillingly an accomplice to a robbery when he was a teenager.

Speaking on his Nova FM radio show Fitzy & Wippa last week, he admitted to potentially driving the getaway car after a friend stole a safe. 

Fitzy explained to co-host Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli: 'I had to pick him up to go to another friend's house. He said "can you come and get me and on the way can you stop at my father-in-law's house because I need to pick something up".'

He continued: 'I pulled the car over, he jumped out of the car. I watched him jump the back fence and he was gone for 10 to 15 mins.'

'Then all of a sudden the back gate opens and he's got a safe and two plants.'

Fitzy revealed his friend then placed the items in the back of his car and told him to start driving.

'I was in a situation thinking "what do I do now?"'

The radio host said several days later his dad questioned the smell of the plants in his car. 

'My old man found out because the plants in the back stunk my whole car out and I was like "Dad I think was accomplish in a robbery".'

Ripped off: Fitzy's anecdote comes after he revealed that he got ripped off by his mates on his season of Big Brother back in 2004

Speaking on his radio program Fitzy & Wippa in July, he said his friends pocketed $70,000 after selling his iconic Massive Loser Squad (MLS) T-shirts, but by the time he was out of the house that it had dwindled down to $10,000.

'I took these T-shirts in and as a joke I said to the guy let’s have them trademarked - so we copyrighted MLS,' he said.

Fitzy explained that he had no idea his friends were selling them until he was evicted from the house in fourth place.
