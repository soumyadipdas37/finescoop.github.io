A shop worker bound with cable ties appeared to be unphased as she continued blowing bubbles with her chewing gum while being held up by an alleged knife-wielding robber.

Three female staff members were allegedly bound with cable ties by Jones who stole money and their mobile phones

Dramatic CCTV released by the store then shows three employees bound with cable ties sold at the store they work in. 

The workers then follow Jones into a back storage room where he locates a safe and repeatedly kicks at it, it is alleged.

But one worker didn't seem to concerned, continuing to chew her gum and blow bubbles, while the other staffer tied together with a cloth look on.

Jones walks out of the room to the manager's office where he locates a set of keys and gets one of the employees to open the safe, it is alleged.

As he unties the pair a large knife allegedly falls out of Jones's back pocket and he immediately picks it up.   

The safe is eventually opened and Jones allegedly heads off with $2,000 as well as the staff member's mobile phones.

When Jones left, Queensland Police were called and allegedly found Jones with the money and mobile phones. 

Police charged Jones with three counts of deprivation of liberty, two counts each of common assault and stealing, and one count each of armed robbery and enter premises and commit indictable offence.

He appeared in Beenleigh Magistrates Court on Tuesday.  

Owner Minesh Parmar gave his traumatised employees a day off to help recover from the alleged incident. 

'I've sent my three staff members home. 'They are trying to get over it,' he told Courier Mail. 

'It was the way it happened — it was terrifying. 

'I'm not worried about the money. I want my staff to go home, to get over this.'
