Colby Covington dominated Tyron Woodley on his way to a fifth round TKO as the welterweight contender received a congratulatory call for President Trump. 

Covington took down a listless Woodley round after round before an injury to the former champion brought a swift end to the fight two minutes into the fifth and final round.

'Ladies and gentlemen, the silent majority is ready to make some noise,' Covington said while wearing an American flag draped around his shoulders following his win.

'If you thought that was a beating, wait until Nov. 3 when Donald Trump gets his hands on sleepy Joe. That's going to be a landslide.'  

'I'm proud of you man. I'm a big fan and I'm proud of you,' Trump told Covington as he received a phone call during his post-fight interview. 

'You're tough, you have the right spirits. So now go win the next one, and keep it for a long time. Just keep that championship for a long time. 

'You are something ... I appreciated the shout out tonight, too. I'm your fan, you're my fan. Two of a kind, two of a kind.'
