Peter Andre's wife Emily has revealed she has been 'put off' from having another baby during the coronavirus pandemic. 

The NHS doctor, 31, said she would find labour a 'really different experience' if Pete, 47, was to miss scans and appointments. 

Emily who is proud mother to Amelia, six, and Theodore, three, said she made the decision after watching Delivering Babies, hosted by Emma Willis.

The show followed women as they negotiated pregnancy during the coronavirus pandemic.  

Emily wrote in her OK! magazine column: 'I've spoken to a lot of people who are pregnant or have given birth during this time and they've told me it's a really different experience because of who can come with them to appointments or even when they're in labour. 

'It slightly puts me off having a baby during this time, because the scans and other aspects are such precious moments that are lovely to share with someone else.'

Emily also applauded new mum Katy Perry for 'demystifying the reality of giving birth'. 

Katy, 35, showed off her post-baby body in a breast pumping harness just five days after giving birth to daughter Daisy Dove last month. 

'Hair and makeup by: @exhaustion,' captioned Perry jokingly, while also tagging the makers of her harness and underwear.

Emily said she thought the singer 'looked awesome'.  

The mother-of-two wrote: 'The fact you can still see her tummy is demystifying the reality of giving birth as you don't just snap back into your previous shape days later, this is an honest picture of the reality and it's great for someone as famous as her to show it.'

Alongside her two children, Emily also raises Pete's children Princess, 13, and Junior, 15.
