Drake appeared to be every inch the doting dad, as he shared a heartwarming snap of his two-year-old son, Adonis, heading to his first day of school on Wednesday.  

The 33-year-old Canadian rapper's little one was decked out in a matching black sweatsuit and his bright blonde hair styled in cornrows for the major milestone.

'First Day Of School...The World Is Yours kid,' the Grammy winner captioned a shot of his tot, who was standing in front of a black SUV and looking back.

Within an hour, the post surpassed two million likes from his more than 78 million Instagram followers. 

Among his doting fans, fellow rappers 21 Savage joked that Adonis 'already got a chauffeur' and Quavo Huncho wore his kid was a 'lil champ' in the comment section. 

Drake, who limited who could comment on the post, also shared in the comment section that his mini-me 'was talking about basketball the whole ride.'

With mom: The mother of Drake's son Sophie Brussaux shared two more images of Adonis in an entirely different outfit, which included a navy blue polo shirt, matching face mask and jean shorts

The mother of Drake's son Sophie Brussaux shared two additional images of Adonis in an entirely different outfit, which included a navy blue polo shirt, matching face mask and jean shorts. 

In her series of pictures, she posed with him on her back in the classroom and holding hands in the school's parking lot. 

As the French model sent her child to school, she donned a figure-hugging black dress, a black and white Chanel scarf, pink flats and a Louis Vuitton face mask.

Her social media post, which has been translated from French, read: 'Mom is proud of her big boy.' 

Drake did not previously acknowledge his son's paternity until Pusha T shamed him on his biting 2018 diss track, called The Story Of Adidon.  

Since he was called out, Drake acknowledged his parenthood on multiple tracks on his album, Scorpion (2018).

But it wasn't until late March of this year that the In My Feelings rapper finally shared photos of his son's face on Instagram.

His slideshow also included some pictures of Drake with Brussaux, an artist and one-time porn actress.

Drake later admitted it was a great relief for him to finally share his own photos of Adonis with the world and his fans.

'It was great for me. It was great to just share that with the world,' the four-time Grammy winner revealed on Lil Wayne's Young Money Radio on Apple Music. 

'I just woke up one morning and I was like, you know what? This is just something that I want to do.'

The God's plan rapper described the experience as 'freeing.'

'I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don't want to feel like, just, because of a life choice I made to be a celebrity, that I got to make everybody live under this blanket,' he added.
