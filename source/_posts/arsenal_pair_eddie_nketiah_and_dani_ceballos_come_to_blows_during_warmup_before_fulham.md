Arsenal players Dani Ceballos and Eddie Nketiah got into a heated exchange during the warm-ups before their season opener against Fulham.

During a small-sided 'rondo' game, Ceballos appeared to become frustrated and put in a heavy challenge on the young striker.

The two appeared to have some strong words and then square up to each other as things almost came to blows.

A couple nearby Arsenal players intervened and walked Nketiah away from the clearly outraged Ceballos.

BT Sport pundit Rio Ferdinand said that Gunners boss Mikel Arteta will not be 'too disappointed' to see the scuffle. 

'End of the day sometimes it gets heated,' Ferdinand explained.

'You'd probably see that once or twice a week in the training ground it just happens we've been here to see it but I'm sure Arteta won't be too disappointed with that.'

Peter Crouch added: 'Good to see it I think, bit of passion.'
