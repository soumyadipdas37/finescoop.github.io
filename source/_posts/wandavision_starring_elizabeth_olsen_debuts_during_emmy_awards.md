The first official trailer for the much-anticipated Disney+ miniseries WandaVision debuted during the virtual 2020 Emmy Awards on Sunday.   

Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are back as their Marvel characters - Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch and Vision -  in a six episode run that Marvel has described as a 'mega event series'.  

Created by Captain Marvel writer Jac Schaeffer, the show centers on the two super-powered beings living an idyllic suburbia life in a world straight out of a 1950s sitcom. 

First taste: The first official trailer for the much-anticipated Disney+ miniseries WandaVision debuted during the virtual 2020 Emmy Awards on Sunday

The teaser opens with the couple playing the traditional husband and wife roles that borders between comedic and creepy, all while shot in black-and-white.

About midway through, the trailer shifts into bright color, complete with more zany and odd behavior.  

The series has been described as a 'blend of classic television and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems.'

Retro: The teaser opens with the couple playing the traditional husband and wife roles, all while shot in black-and-white.

Triumphant return: Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are back as their Marvel characters -- Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch and Vision

The show centers on the two super-powered beings living an idyllic suburbia life in a world straight out of a 1950s sitcom.

Towards the end of the teaser, some of the stars of the show can be seen dancing while other fly through portals as federal agents seemingly look on.

'We are an unusual couple, you know,' Olsen's Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch says to Bettany's Vision in a return to the black-and-white look.

'Oh I don't think that ever was in question,' Vision answers back at end the trailer along with crowd laughter in the background. 

Bizarre: The six episode season has described by Marvel as a 'mega event series'

Hybrid: The series is a 'blend of classic television and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems'

MCU: WandaVision was created by Captain Marvel writer Jac Schaeffer

WandaVision will take place following the events of last year's Avengers: Endgame, but so far far it's not clear how Vision, who was killed in Infinity War, was revived.  

It's also been revealed that the show will feature characters from Captain Marvel, Thor and Ant-Man, and it will tie into the upcoming 2022 movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

Along with Olsen and Bettany, WandaVision also stars Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis, Randall Park as Jimmy Woo and Kathryn Hahn plays a 'nosy neighbor'. 

In living color: About midway through, the trailer shifts into bright color, complete with more zany and odd behavior

Out of this world: Bettany plays an android and Avenger created using the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron and the Mind Stone

Shaking it: Towards the end of the teaser, some of the stars of the show can be seen dancing while other fly through portals as federal agents seemingly look on

Blast from the past: Some scenes are reminiscent of the 1960s fantasy sitcom Bewitched

The series, which has been long awaited by Marvel fans, was also one of the many productions shut down in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier in the year. 

The first look at the upcoming series took place earlier this year, during the Super Bowl in February.

So far there's no official word on an exact release date just yet but it is expected to premiere some time in December 2020.            

There's plenty of high-flying scenes by the last part of the teaser

The premise: WandaVision will take place after the events of last year's Avengers: Endgame

Familar faces: The show will feature characters from Captain Marvel, Thor and Ant-Man

Coming soon: So far there's no official word on an exact release date just yet but it is expected to premiere some time in December 2020

Jimmy Kimmel hosted the 2020 Emmys at the Staples Center in Los Angeles without a studio audience due to the the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, although he tried to dupe the viewing audience in the opening by having clips from previous ceremonies edited in.
