On a bright day in London the model kept her eyes shielded behind a pair of heavily tinted sunglasses as she made her way into popular Italian restaurant Scalini. 

She gave her look an understated flourish by styling her hair with a conventional centre parting, while hr make-up was reduced to natural colour tones. 

Evidently in high spirits, the model gave onlookers a beaming smile as she exited the Chelsea eatery following a light lunch.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph on Monday, Shanina reflected on the progress the brand has made over the years, saying it has opened up to diversity on the runway.

'I think that over the years Victoria's Secret has opened up to more diversity,' she told the publication.

'I think we will see more and more in the coming years,' Shanina added, explaining that the girls who currently strut the coveted runway work very hard.

'The girls who walk for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show work really hard to be their fittest and healthiest.'

The interview comes after model Robyn Lawley, 29, launched a petition to boycott the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, for not casting any plus size models.

'I am sick and tired of seeing the same body type,' Robyn said on The Morning Show last month.

Robyn called for Victoria's Secret to feature 'a few other sizes' and for the lingerie brand to add more diversity.
