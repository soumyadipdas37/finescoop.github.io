She recently debuted her new relationship with athlete Matt Poole.

And on Friday, Tammy Hembrow and her new man were spotted leaving popular Asian eatery, Maggie Choo, in Broadbeach, Queensland.

Known for her bold fashion choices, the 26-year-old risked a wardrobe malfunction in a skimpy pink number.

Leaving little to the imagination, Tammy dared to bare in the thigh-split mini dress during the night out. 

Her halterneck ensemble was backless, featured a plunging neckline and cinched in at her waist. 

As she walked, the mother-of-two's famous derriere could be seen as the dress slightly lifted in the breeze.

Tammy went all out with a glamorous look, with her makeup consisting of a pale pink pout, bold winged eyeliner and false eyelashes.

She kept her long blonde tresses in a bun, while her fringe was parted at the front.

Meanwhile, her beau Matt opted for a casual look in a white T-shirt and ripped denim jeans.

Tammy hung a small pink handbag over her toned arms, as she kept one hand near her top to avoid a wardrobe malfunction.  

The new couple appeared to be accompanied by Tammy's sisters Emilee and Amy.

The social media sensation's night out on the town comes after she recently returned from a romantic getaway with her new beau, Ironman Matt Poole, 32.

Last week the couple, along with a group of friends, jetted off to the Whitsundays.

While Tammy has yet to officially share a photo of him on her Instagram, the hunky triathlete debuted their relationship on his social media posting a photo of them cosied up together on a yacht during the tropical holiday.
