They've been married for five years after tying the knot in a romantic ceremony in Exeter. 

But Emily Andre revealed that she was rather underwhelmed by Peter's attempts to impress her during the early days of their romance after he turned up to her university halls in a Lamborghini. 

The Mysterious Girl hitmaker, 47, and his doctor wife, 31, joined Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes, both 60, for a special edition of Loose Women on Wednesday.

Funny story: Emily Andre revealed that she was rather underwhelmed by Peter's attempts to impress her during the early days of their romance after he turned up to her university halls in a Lamborghini

And during the course of the show, the couple were quizzed about the early stages of their courtship, with Emily recalling that her now-husband made a big faux pas. 

Emily told Eamonn and Ruth that one snowy night, Peter had decided to visit her while she was studying at university and rocked up to her halls in his Italian sports car. 

She told how the star almost had an accident due to the weather conditions and that the gesture was lost on her as she's 'not really into cars'.  

Emily went on: 'That doesn't really float my boat, so I think he misjudged it slightly. Because I couldn't care less about cars or anything.

'But he didn't do it again, that's for sure!'

While Peter replied: 'It was just foolish and I don't know, I think in my thirties, I think I was having a mid-life crisis. I really do.

'In my forties, I just wouldn't do that now.'

Probing further, host Ruth then asked whether at the time Peter was 'trying hard to woo her'.

With the singer responding: 'Yeah, because I really liked her and it took my so long to like her. Let me rephrase that, it took me so long to realise what I was feeling.

Bad plan: Emily went on: 'That doesn't really float my boat, so I think he misjudged it slightly. Because I couldn't care less about cars or anything'

'Once I asked and got approval from her dad, I had to because he was my friend, I thought "I can't stuff this up". So I have to do what I can.'

Turning to his wife, he added: 'To be honest, you're here now. The Lambo's gone! That's way gone.'

The couple also discussed the idea of having a third child. They are already parents to Amelia, six, and Theo, three.

Big mistake: While Peter replied: 'It was just foolish and I don't know, I think in my thirties, I think I was having a mid-life crisis. I really do'

Peter also shares children Junior,15, and 13-year-old Princess with ex-wife Katie Price. 

Emily said: 'After we had our youngest Theo, he was really hard work. He really tested my parenting skills. Now he's gone to school, we started to think about it, I don’t know.'

While Peter who previously ruled out further children after their son was born admitted that he's now open to the idea, adding it's up to his with but 'I'm OK with it.'

Loose Women continues weekdays from 12.30pm on ITV.
