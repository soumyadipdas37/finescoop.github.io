Dorinda Medley finally got real about her anger during the last installment of the RHONY Season 12 reunion, which aired Thursday on Bravo.

‘Literally, to tell you the truth, I probably should have taken off this season,’ Dorinda, 55, said to show host Andy Cohen, 52. ‘I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.’

Throughout the season, Dorinda had been accused by her co-stars of insulting them to deflect from her own pain, and sidestepped questions about her behavior when questioned.

Season off: ‘Literally, to tell you the truth, I probably should have taken off this season,’ Dorinda, 55, said to show host Andy Cohen, 52. ‘I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown'

In August, she was let go from RHONY, and press reports claimed her mean attitude was behind the break—but Andy himself said she just needed a ‘pause,’ and he was open to her return.

‘I think that was more overwhelmed this season than I’ve ever been, and I don’t think I reached out for help enough,’ Dorinda acknowledged, citing a broken rib she’d suffered, her breakup with boyfriend John Mahdessian, the death of a friend, and the flooding of her vacation home.

‘I couldn’t catch a break,’ she recalled. ‘I just didn’t want to be there. I was angry. I was really angry about what was happening about it, and I definitely projected it. And I did feel like I couldn’t cope with it. I really did. I was at my wits’ end.’

Dorinda said the thing that made her ‘the most upset’ during the season was that pal Ramona Singer, 63, constantly harped on her behavior, saying she had made a painful time ‘worse.’

‘You never called me once outside the show,’ Dorinda cried. ‘You never took me to dinner. All you did was remind me the whole time, and you—as much as you didn’t like John and stuff, it was mine to go through, and I needed you to do it.’

Ramona fished around in a drawer next to her while Dorinda was talking and whipped out a thick stack of papers, which she waved at Dorinda.

‘I, once the show ended, I texted you every day,’ Ramona insisted. ‘Here’s the texts.’

Dorinda replied that by the time the show ended, she was fine again and didn’t need the support any longer—it was the period before that during which she was suffering.

‘I needed her to pull me aside, not constantly in front of people hammer me,’ Dorinda affirmed.

She said she’d cried to Sonja Morgan, 56, at night, and even Leah McSweeney, 37—a new castmate whom she’d only just met—instead of Ramona.

‘I wanted Ramona to call me and just say this: “I love you. I’m here for you.”’ Dorinda related.

Ramona wasn’t having it, offering that once Tinsley Mortimer, 45, left the show, she’d become Dorinda’s ‘punching bag.’

She insisted that Dorinda had frequently hurt her feelings this season and started to quote from the texts she’d been sent by her, as Dorinda interrupted and said that Ramona couldn’t even ‘be present’ and listen to her complaints.

‘Read the texts!’ Ramona yelled, throwing them up in the air. ‘I love you! Why are you doing this?’

When Dorinda asked her to pick the papers up, Ramona said, ‘I would, but I’m not allowed to get that close,’ as Andy scurried over to get them.

Texts: ‘Read the texts!’ Ramona yelled, throwing them up in the air. ‘I love you! Why are you doing this?'

Dorinda apologized to Luann de Lesseps, 55, for having said nasty things to her in the past about her 2017 arrest and cabaret show—though Luann didn’t buy it.

‘How can you look at yourself on the show and [not] say, “Holy s***, I need to change,” Luann asked her.

‘Well, I do with you,’ Dorinda swore, then gestured to Ramona. ‘With her, I don’t.’

Apology: Dorinda apologized to Luann de Lesseps, 55, for having said nasty things to her in the past about her 2017 arrest and cabaret show—though Luann didn’t buy it

Leah empathized with Dorinda, saying, ‘I would rather deal with someone who has anger issues than someone who says horrific things like Ramona has.’

Dorinda admitted that she’d been in ‘a lot of pain’ during the season, adding that she felt ‘wounded, weak, vulnerable’ and unable to ask for help.

She felt badly that she and Ramona couldn’t ‘come to terms,’ as they had a 20-year relationship and really cared for each other, but she hadn’t felt like Ramona had her back at all.

Ramona said she loved her, and they vowed to try to repair their friendship, bumping elbows instead of hugging as Andy cautioned, ‘You can’t touch.’

‘By the grace of God I got through, and hopefully 2021 will be a better year, and a happy year,’ Dorinda said.

Ramona also found herself on the hot seat during the show, defending her constant reference to having ’fifty girlfriends’ by saying she saw many of them often.

When a viewer asked if Ramona was a terrible friend, Bravo showed footage of her insulting the RHONY cast and leaving them behind at her own Hamptons house.

‘Ramona, you’ve always been a double-booker, but leaving a party at your own home in the Hamptons was nuts,’ a viewer said. ‘Can you not see how desperately you suffer from FOMO?’

Ramona explained that everyone had been invited to go out with her, but decided not to—an excuse that Sonja dismissed.

‘You just wanted to go to the party ‘cause you’re horny,’ Sonja retorted. ‘That’s it.’

Sonja confessed that Ramona’s talk of having ‘fifty friends’ had triggered her all season, noting that she’d been there for Ramona during ‘thick and thin,’ and shouting, ‘STFU!’

‘Where are these people gonna be when it’s you and me, we’re two-for-one martinis at the Burger Heaven?’ she yelled. ‘That’s you and me. Not them! They don’t care about you.’

Horny: ‘You just wanted to go to the party ‘cause you’re horny,’ Sonja retorted. ‘That’s it.’

Leah wondered why Ramona had gotten so excited when her friends chipped in to get her a real Gucci bag for her birthday, noting that Ramona also possessed a fake.

Sonja told Ramona that unlike those women, she hadn’t donated $100 to the ‘pocketbook fund,’ and flipped it the bird as she added, ‘I’m not buying Chanels to be your friend.’

Sonja felt Ramona was ‘social-climbing,’ while Dorinda called her ‘insincere’ for throwing herself a lavish birthday party full of people she barely knew.

Ramona told Sonja during the season that she was too heavy, a comment that subsequently led Sonja to overeat and gain five pounds, for which Ramona refused to apologize.

Asked why she’d fallen out with friend of the cast Elyse Slaine, Ramona cryptically said, ‘She’s a Black Widow, and I knew this and I never should have trusted her. Follow your gut.’

She said the woman ‘betrayed’ her after promising she’d always have her back.

When Ramona offered that she was friends with happy, upbeat people, Dorinda pointed out that a real friend has your back in good times and bad—otherwise they are just acquaintances.

‘If I am going through something traumatic, I have to find a friend that is going to shepherd me and journey me through that,’ Dorinda said. ‘Life isn’t about always being happy.’

‘Here I am,’ Sonja replied, raising her hand to volunteer.

Sonja’s friends celebrated the success of her Sonja by Sonja Morgan line, which had assumed prominent placement at two Century 21 department stores in Manhattan and had seen online sales shoot up 117 percent since the coronavirus pandemic began.

Sonja was making big moves at home, too—she’d just marked down her Upper East Side townhouse by two million dollars to around $8.6 million, and was ready to start dating again.

As the show closed, Andy asked the Housewives which Season 12 moments they would most like to ‘socially distance from’ and which cast member they most wanted to hug.

Ramona regretted chiding Leah about her mental health issues, while Leah said she would like to distance herself ‘from the entire state of Rhode Island.’

Dorinda apologized to Luann for comments about her arrest, while Lu said she regretted insulting Sonja during a group trip to the Berkshires, and Sonja said she’d like to go back and control her drinking more.

When the COVID-19 pandemic is over, Dorinda and Lu want to hug everyone in the cast. Ramona and Sonja said they want to hug Dorinda, while Leah hopes to hug Ramona.

In lieu of the group’s usual toast to end the show, they all took a socially distanced selfie with Andy, who urged them to ‘stay healthy, stay safe.’
