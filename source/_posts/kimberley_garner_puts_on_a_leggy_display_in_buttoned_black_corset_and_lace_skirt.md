She's was soaking up the sun in St Tropez last month.

And Kimberley Garner showed off her holiday tan as she put on a leggy display at the Lucid film premier in central London on Monday night.

The former Made In Chelsea star, 29, wowed in a black velvet corset with silver button detailing which she teamed with a thigh-grazing lace skirt.

Wow! Kimberley Garner put on a leggy display in a buttoned black corset and lace skirt as she attended the Lucid premier in London on Monday night 

The blonde beauty added a casual touch to the outfit with bright white trainers as she carried a leather jacket in her hand.

She wore her trademark blonde tresses in a poker straight style and highlighted her naturally pretty features with dewy makeup.

The swimwear designer looked in high spirits as she beamed for the camera while heading into the venue.

As she returned from European hot spot St Tropez last month, the model revealed that she tested negative for COVID-19.

Kimberley was able to return to the UK just before the new quarantine restrictions were enforced which requires all tourists to self isolate for two weeks following her trip abroad. 

When she's not making a narrow-escape from France, the model runs her own swimwear brand, Kimberley London, which features a range of luxury pieces.

She has recently shared a slew of sultry bikini pictures on her Instagram, displaying various styles from her collection.  

Earlier this summer, Kimberley was pictured with Made In Chelsea co-star Ollie Chambers, after enjoying a tennis session together.

Although Kimberley recently revealed that she has been having a 'great' time dating, she confirmed to MailOnline in July that her relationship with Ollie is purely platonic.

It came after she revealed she cancelled a secret wedding and ended a long-term relationship last summer.
