Rebecca Judd has revealed why she calls her former AFL footy star Chris Judd by the playful nickname 'Juddy'. 

Speaking on her 3PM Pick-Up on Tuesday, the 37-year-old model and TV presenter said she thought 'Chris' was just too formal for him. 

'[It's funny] how people refer to footy players by their surname,' she said to co-host Monty Dimond during the show.

'We walk down the street and people are like "Hey Judd, Judd, Judd, can I get a photo Judd?" His name is Chris, it's so weird,' she added. 

Bec was then pulled-up by co-host Monty, who reminded the mother-of-four that she herself calls Chris Judd, 'Juddy' as a nickname. 

'I never did when he played footy,' Bec insisted. 

'But now that he is not a footy player anymore, I call him Juddy,' she added. 

Bec said she thought his first name sounds so 'formal', which is why she chose not to use it.

'Chris sounds so formal,' she exclaimed. 'He turns as soon as I say Juddy.' 

Bec finished by admitting she was probably one of the few people who ever called him 'Chris' in his personal life.   

Rebecca and Chris have been married for 10 years and share four young children together.

The couple are parents to son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins, Tom and Darcy, both aged three.   

Earlier this year, Bec revealed that she and Chris split early in their relationship. 

'When [Chris] Juddy and I were first hooking up when we were, I think about 19. We had only been hooking up for a little bit.

'He had this event to go to and I wasn't really expecting to be invited to that event because we'd only just got together. But I wasn't expecting him to invite his ex-girlfriend instead of me!' 

According to Bec, she was so 'heartbroken' she almost broke up with him at the time.

'It totally set us back I reckon another five or six months. So him and I were on-and-off for 18 months because none of us could actually tell each other what we were really thinking, even though we were mad for each other,' she revealed.
