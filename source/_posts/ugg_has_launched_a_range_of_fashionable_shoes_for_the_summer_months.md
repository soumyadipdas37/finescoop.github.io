Iconic Australian shoe brand Ugg Express have curated a collection of summer flats that look nothing like the traditional sheepskin boots with fleece the brand is famous for.

The fashionable warm weather footwear is still made from high quality sheepskin and leather, but it is meant to be worn to a casual dinner or in the office when the mercury is climbing.   

Its new arrivals range from stylish flats, chic black leather loafers and comfortable sneakers - with prices starting from $152.

The Ever Ugg Lola Loafers ($152) come in both white and black colourways and are perfect for pairing with a pencil skirt or corporate attire. 

The back of the heel can also be folded down and used as a slide for the hotter days in summer.

Comfort and style have come together in the Australian Shepherd Linda Flat ($199) which is available in four muted shades that offer support while you're on the go. 

The Ever Ugg Loreen Flat ($354) might be on the steeper end of the price pool but its worth it for the leather finish and timeless gold and pearl details.

While they can't be worn to the beach they are a shoo-in for a weekend brunch or backyard BBQ, particularly if opulence is your go-to style.

Ugg sneakers can be worn for a casual shopping trip or dressed up for a backyard pool party

Finally the Tarramarra Lorna Flat ($192.25) boasts a mesh exterior and rubber sponge sole for any long walks you might choose to go on

There is no replacing the usual Ugg slippers though, and many of them are on sale now that the colder season is coming to an end

You won't wake up the next day with aching feet as the thick bottom layer is designed to be cushioning.

There is no replacing the usual Ugg slippers though, and many of them are on sale now that the colder season is coming to an end.

The As Ugg Cross Fluffy Slide Linty is reduced to $49 from $100 and the As Ugg Unisex Waffle Slipper is $56 down from $138.
