Temperatures stayed up in the 70s and 80s in Manhattan on Tuesday, but that didn't stop Jennifer Lopez from covering up her astounding figure in a warm sweater.

The 51-year-old Hustlers star rocked her casual look while out in Tribeca for an early evening dinner with her fiancé Alex Rodriguez, 45, who looked dashing in a dark suit.

The outing came the same day that the couple renewed their push to buy the New York Mets by indicating the actress would be the controlling figure if they won, rather than her future husband.

On the town: Jennifer Lopez, 51, looked casual while Alex Rodriguez, 45, rocked a classy suit as they went out to dinner in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood on Tuesday evening

Jennifer looked casual yet chic in her knit cardigan, which featured eye-catching rows of black patterns.

She wore it over a simple white tank top and a cream-colored pair of high-waisted baggy corduroy slacks that were tied with a long, thin belt that ran down her leg.

The Out Of Sight star wore a matching pair of chunky boots and carried a black alligator print handbag with her.

The 5ft5in beauty kept her bleached blonde locks pulled back into a tight ponytail and she blocked out the setting sun with a large pair of yellow-tinted sunglasses that resembled butterfly wings.

A-Rod looked stylish in a well-tailored charcoal suit, which he wore with a classic white shirt.

He rounded out the classy ensemble with a silver tie and a pair of black loafers.

The lovebirds both wore black masks to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus as they headed toward the restaurant for dinner.

In recent days, J.Lo has been favoring more casual, baggy ensembles while out with Alex, who has dressed up in suits lately for their NYC outings.

Earlier in the day, it was reported that the couple were renewing their bid to buy the New York Mets baseball team.

The couple spoke with the New York Post earlier in the day about their bid, which they claimed was similar to or larger than the frontrunner bid from Steve Cohen, who seems likely to buy the team for $2.35 billion.

The two aren't as wealthy as the hedge fund billionaire, but they're working with a group of investors to try to buy the iconic New York team. 

'It ain’t over until it is over,' Jennifer told The Post. 'We are New Yorkers and we are not going to give up. We feel we have the best bid for the sport, the team and the city.'

Switch-up: Earlier in the day, it was reported that the couple were renewing their bid to buy the New York Mets baseball team. Jennifer will take the lead position to cut A-Rod, who is polarizing among MLB insiders

Competition: The couple told the New York Post that their bid was similar to or larger than the frontrunner bid from Steve Cohen, who seems likely to buy the team for $2.35 billion

Never surrender: 'It ain’t over until it is over,' Jennifer told The Post. 'We are New Yorkers and we are not going to give up. We feel we have the best bid for the sport, the team and the city'

Part of their strategy to make their bid more appealing to other MLB team owners, who must vote on a new owner, will be to switch out Alex for Jennifer as the head of the organization.

Some MLB insiders have worried that Rodriguez's polarizing legacy and his history of steroid use could harm the association, but Lopez is trying to take him out of the equation to sweeten the bid.

Despite their continued interest, insiders said that Cohen's bid was still the frontrunner and was only taking longer because of complicated language about taxes.

However, at least 23 of the 30 MLB owners would need to vote in his favor, which might be difficult to round up due to the $1.8 billion insider trading fine his firm was saddled with in the past.
