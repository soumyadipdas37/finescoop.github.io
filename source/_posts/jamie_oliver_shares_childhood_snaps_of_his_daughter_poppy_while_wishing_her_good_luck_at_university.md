Alongside the snaps, Jamie wrote: 'I can’t believe this young lady my first born Poppy has headed off to university, OMG where did that little girl go!?!?

'Good luck Pops love you so much take this great opportunity and run like the wind!!!! Love Dad x x x x'. 

The pictures included Poppy blowing out the candles on a cake and wearing a pink crown hat on her eighth birthday.

Along with Daisy, Jamie is also father to Daisy, 17, Petal, 11, Buddy, nine, and River, three, with his wife Jools, 45.

The businessman recently admitted that homeschooling his children during lockdown had been 'misery'.

Jamie said while some of his brood were given plenty of work to keep them going throughout lockdown, other teachers have left him to fill in the gaps himself. 

He explained: 'I had one kid that had really good home-schooling and one that was kind of left to it. 

'I think for parents all around the country, home-schooling has been a blend of misery and... and misery.'

Hands on: Jamie has had his hands full, juggling Poppy, Daisy, 17, Petal, 11, Buddy, nine, and River, three, with his wife Jools (pictured in 2016)

In June, Jamie celebrated 20 years of marriage to wife Jools.   

Jools shared a shot of herself letting loose on the dance floor during their 10-year wedding anniversary celebrations.

Taking to Instagram, the author uploaded the fun-filled image, which showed her heavily pregnant as she donned an off-the-shoulder ivory gown.  

As she hit the floor with both hands in the air, her pals were putting on an energetic display, including actor-turned-filmmaker Dexter Fletcher, 54.

Captioning the shot, mother-of-five Jools wrote: 'Just found this @jaseflem123 @dexfletch @ellyflem 10 years ago at our wedding anniversary....best moves jase (little buds in my tummy 8months pregnant..think this may have been a dance off).'
