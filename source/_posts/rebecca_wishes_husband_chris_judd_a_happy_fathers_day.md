So sweet: Rebecca Judd has wished her husband Chris Judd a happy Father's Day in an amusing way in an Instagram post shared Sunday. Pictured with their children 

Rebecca captioned the image: 'Happy Father's Day baby daddy. No idea who you're bathing here but you're nailing it as always'. 

She also shared a photo of the whole family together, captioning it: 'Our king. Our hero. Our superman. Love you'. 

Rebecca and Chris have been married for ten years and share four young children together. 

Baby love: Bec posted a photo of Chris bathing one of the pair's four children as a baby. She captioned the image: 'Happy Father's Day baby daddy. No idea who you're bathing here but you're nailing it as always'

She also shared a photo of the whole family together, captioning it: 'Our king. Our hero. Our superman. Love you'

The couple are parents to son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins Tom and Darcy, both aged three.   

Bec explained on her KIIS FM radio show, the 3pm Pick-up, that she and Chris split early in their relationship. 

'When [Chris] Juddy and I were first hooking up when we were, I think about 19. We had only been hooking up for a little bit.

'He had this event to go to and I wasn't really expecting to be invited to that event because we'd only just got together. But I wasn't expecting him to invite his ex-girlfriend instead of me!' 

According to Bec, she was so 'heartbroken', she almost broke up with him at the time.

'It totally set us back I reckon another five or six months. So him and I were on-and-off for 18 months because none of us could actually tell each other what we were really thinking, even though we were mad for each other,' she revealed.

 Long time! Rebecca and Chris have been married for ten years
