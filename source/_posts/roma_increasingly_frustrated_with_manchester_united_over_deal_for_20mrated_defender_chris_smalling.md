Roma are losing patience with Manchester United as they try to close a deal for defender Chris Smalling.

Sources claim the Italian club are ready to consider alternative options which could leave the deal for Smalling in the balance.

United want in the region of £20million for the central defender and the clubs have not been able to agree a fee.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and United want a fee of £20m for the 30-year-old centre-back

And with Serie A due to begin this weekend, Roma want a new centre-half as matter of urgency.

Smalling spent a successful loan spell in the Italian capital last season, and Roma want to make the move permanent.

But the failure so far to agree a transfer fee has left the switch in the balance.

The news comes after Sportsmail revealed Smalling sat out United's photoshoots for TV on Monday as he remains intent on leaving.

Smalling had a successful loan at Roma last season and is determined to leave Old Trafford

The 30-year-old has continued training away from the first team squad after asking United to resolve his transfer to Roma.

Smalling was absent from training on Tuesday and Wednesday last week as he discussed his future and with no assurances about his first team place forthcoming from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer he has made up his mind to leave Old Trafford.

Solskjaer is in the market for a new centre back but that is likely to come next summer.
