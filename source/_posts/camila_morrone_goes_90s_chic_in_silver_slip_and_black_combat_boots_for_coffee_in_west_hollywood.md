Camila Morrone has been enjoying plenty of romantic time with boyfriend Leonardo DiCaprio during quarantine.

But the Argentine-American actress is ready to get back to work, as Hollywood bounces back from COVID-19.

She was pure '90s vibes Wednesday in a slip dress and combat boots, as she stepped out with her stylist Micah Schifman for a coffee run in West Hollywood.

The 23-year-old donned a mid-length silver satin Magda Butrym dress with an oversized cornflower blue blazer, which she wore with the sleeves rolled up.

She finished the look with a pair of black wayfarers, a gold Louis Vuitton necklace and laced-up black leather boots, while carrying a black patent leather handbag.

Morrone has reportedly been getting closer with DiCaprio, 45, with whom she's been spending her quarantine.

A source told People in June: 'He is usually very independent, spends lots of time with friends, but because of the lockdown, he has mostly spent time with Camila. He loves being with her.'

The 'it' couple has faced plenty of criticism over their 22-year age gap, as DiCaprio has been known to date in her very specific age group.

The Valley Girl actress isn't bothered by it though, which she admitted to the Los Angeles Times in December.

She said: 'There’s so many relationships in Hollywood — and in the history of the world — where people have large age gaps. I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date.'

Morrone added of being referred to as 'Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend': 'I feel like there should always be an identity besides who you're dating... I understand the association, but I’m confident that will continue to slip away and be less of a conversation.'
