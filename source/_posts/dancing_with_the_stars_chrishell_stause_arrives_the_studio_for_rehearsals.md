Chrishell further elongated her legs with a pair of barely-there nude strappy heels, while carrying her dance gear in a gym bag on her shoulder.

The reality star flashed a beaming smile as she enhanced her pretty features with a full face of make-up and wore her highlighted locks in beachy waves.

She ensured she followed state coronavirus guidelines as she arrived equipped with a protective face mask.

Chrishell was later spotted exiting the studio wearing a form-fitting white crop top, teamed with a pair of gym leggings and trainers.

The outing came following the news Derek Hough would be joining the judge's table in lieu of longtime judge Len Goodman.

Derek, 35, was a dancer on the show from 2007 to 2016, winning the coveted MirrorBall trophy a record six times.
