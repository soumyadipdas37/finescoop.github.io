Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell hosted a meeting for Republican lawmakers to sit down with Amy Coney Barrett on Capitol Hill Tuesday as she prepares for a swift but controversial nomination process.

'[Barrett will] be visiting with members who are interested in talking to her during the course of the next few days. And we're glad to have her here and get the process started,' Senate Majority Leader McConnell told a group of press gathered in the Mansfield Meeting Room.

Ahead of the private meetings on Tuesday, Vice President Pence called for a 'respectful hearing' for Barrett.

White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows were standing behind Pence during his short remarks for the media.

'We look forward, our entire team leader, to working with you, Republicans in the Senate and, we hope, Democrats in the Senate, as well, as you discharge your duty to advise consent,' Pence said.

'We truly do believe that Judge Barrett represents the best of America,' he told select press allowed in ahead of the meeting.

Barrett did not make any remarks and no one commented as a member of the press asked if the judge should recuse herself from any cases related to the 2020 election if she were confirmed ahead of Election Day.

Several Democrats already say they will refuse to meet with the federal judge, claiming Barrett's nomination is 'illegitimate' and a 'sham.'

Pence called for a 'respectful hearing' as several Democrats already claim they will not meet with the judge 

But that doesn't matter, as Senate Republicans have the votes to confirm Barrett – giving Trump an unprecedented three Supreme Court nominations in the first term of his presidency.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham announced Sunday that the confirmation process for Barrett will begin on October 12. He also said they would then bring her nomination to the Senate floor by October 22 – signaling a confirmation vote before Halloween.

Two Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, say they will not vote to confirm Barrett. But the GOP still has the simple majority votes needed.

The two dissenting Republicans, as well as many Democrats, cite their opposition to Barrett's nomination as being set on an apparent precedent from 2016 when the GOP-majority Senate refused to move forward with then-President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nomination months before the presidential election.

President Donald Trump announced during a Rose Garden event Saturday his nomination of Barrett to fill the seat left vacant by Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

The 48-year-old Roman Catholic and mother of seven has also come under fire for her religion, as Democrats claim she will not be able to separate her devout religious beliefs from her rulings on the Supreme Court.

They specifically cite a woman's right to choose to have a doctor terminate their pregnancy, and say Barrett's confirmation would threaten potential overture of the landmark decision in Roe v. Wade.

The Supreme Court seat opened earlier this month with the death of the 87-year-old Justice Ginsburg – who passed after years of health issues especially related to her battle with pancreatic cancer.

The most liberal justice’s granddaughter said Ginsburg’s dying wish was that she be replaced by the next president, and not Trump.
