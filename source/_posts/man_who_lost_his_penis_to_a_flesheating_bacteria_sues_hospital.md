A man is suing a hospital after his penis was amputated when he developed flesh-eating bacteria. 

The 70-year-old from Shepparton, in Victoria, alleges that Goulburn Valley Health failed to treat him 'adequately' when he complained to the hospital of his illness, according to The Goulburn Valley News. 

In a Supreme Court writ filed on Monday, Wayne Grundy claims he caught the bacterial infection and 'necrotising fasciitis' during a week-long stay at the facility in April and May 2018.

He alleges that staff at the hospital 'failed to adequately or properly assess the penis adequately or at all' and did not administer antibiotics for the first one-and-a-half days of treatment. 

Among the other claims is that he was not transferred to Royal Melbourne Hospital for specialist treatment when the infection was diagnosed. 

The writ claims Mr Grundy suffers 'psychological upset together with depression and anxiety' and 'will continue to suffer loss and damage'. 

He claims he has also developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the alleged botched treatment. 

Carmelo Barbante from Barbarte Personal Injury Lawyers told the publication that these types of cases were rare but the allegations of negligence were serious. 

His client is seeking medical costs, damages, and interest. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Goulburn Valley Health for comment.  

He alleges that staff at the hospital (pictured) 'failed to adequately or properly assess the penis adequately or at all' and did not administer antibiotics for the first one-and-a-half days of treatment
