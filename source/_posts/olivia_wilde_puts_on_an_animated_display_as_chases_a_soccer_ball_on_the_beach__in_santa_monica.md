Olivia Wilde spiced up one of her regular trips to the beach with a high-spirited game of soccer with a group of friends on Friday in Santa Monica.

The 36-year-old Booksmart director flashed her eye-catching figure in a slightly sheer white maxi dress, which gave an obstructed view of her cobalt blue swimsuit. 

The blonde also showed off her competitive side, while racing down the sand to chase after an orange and white soccer ball, which tumbled toward the ocean.

As she ran barefoot, the mother-of-two kept one hand on her wide-brimmed floppy hat to ensure it stayed on her head. 

To beat Southern California's massive heat wave, Wilde was also seen enjoying a dip in the water. 

The actress shares her three-year-old daughter Daisy and son Otis, six, with fiancé Jason Sudeikis.

The longtime lovebirds have been engaged for seven years, and together for a total of nine.  

The 44-year-old actor recently revealed he took his time when it came to their first kiss, because he thought he wouldn't be kissing anyone else ever again. 

Last month, Sudeikis was asked by All Access' Sibley Scoles if it was 'fact or fiction' that he waited 'one month to text Olivia for a date, and on the fourth date there was no kiss.'

The Horrible Bosses star said that, 'The majority of that is fact, yes. It might be five weeks or three weeks, but that's fact, yeah.' 

Sudeikis and Wilde started dating in 2011, after the actor split with his first wife, writer Kay Cannon, who he was married to from 2004 to 2008.

The actor popped the question to Wilde in 2013, with Wilde giving birth to their son Otis in 2014 and daughter Daisy in 2016.
