A huge mansion boasting six bedrooms, a private maid's quarter and its own Turkish bathhouse has hit the market for $45million. 

The sprawling waterfront mansion, on Knightsbridge Parade East, in the Gold Coast, was designed by the Brunei Royal Family architect Bayden Goddard and offers stunning views of Coomera Broadwater and South Stradbroke Island.

The home, featuring a wellness suite, massage room and a huge lap pool will go to auction on October 17 with a reserve of $45million
