Manchester United fans have heaped praise on Dean Henderson after the goalkeeper made a vital save as his side led Luton 1-0 in the Carabao Cup.

The Premier League side went to win the third-round tie 3-0 but Henderson, who was making his United debut, prevented Nathan Jones' team getting back into the game in the 81st minute.

It was the goalkeeper's first save of the evening and fans praised his concentration levels



Henderson had little to do but sprung into action when called upon, making his first save of the evening to deny Tom Lockyer, who then saw his follow-up effort cleared off the line. 

The shot-stopper is currently Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's No2 with David de Gea still the first choice 'keeper but the 23-year-old gave a good account of himself at Kenilworth Road. 

And fans heaped praise on the England international, with one supporter claiming: 'The future is in safe hands.'

Another tweeted: 'Great performance Hendo! And great save!.. first of many hopefully mate.'

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side took the lead through a Juan Mata penalty in the first half before late goals from Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood ensured victory. 

Henderson shared his joy at making his debut for the Red Devils, tweeting: 'I dreamt about this my whole life! Unbelievable feeling to make my debut for the club I love!! Clean sheet and a win to top it off!!!'  







One fan replied to the 'keeper: 'Deano what concentration you had throughout that game, you had virtually nothing to do until the 81st minute only to pull off a top drawer save. Future is looking bright lad. Future England No1 and future Manchester United No1.'

Other supporters described the save as 'world class' and predicted it would be the 'first of many' for the youngster.

His manager was also full of praise for the 'keeper after the game. 'We have a 'keeper back there who’s done his job. It was a good workout. That’s the job our keeper sometimes have to do. They have to stay concentrated and David has done that for years.'
