She split from the rapper in August last year after four years together.

And Maya Jama has revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs.

The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya, 26, insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.

Speaking during a Q&A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it’s like, "This is this, it’s everybody’s business".'

Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heady Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.

He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew’s still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. 

'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn’t down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that’s my one desire.'

Maya has since been linked to Drake, who reportedly first contacted the TV star in 2018, but she ignored his messages as she was still dating Stormzy at the time.

The God's Plan hitmaker, 33, even provoked Maya's ex Stormzy in a new song where he refers to the TV presenter as a 'sweet one'.

A source said: 'Drake definitely appeared to have a soft spot for Maya and late in 2018 he started following her on Instagram out of the blue. She totally ignored him and didn’t follow him back as she was with Stormzy.

'Even when she split with Stormzy it’s not something Maya wanted to pursue and she has left it.'

Drake's jibe on rapper Headie One’s track Only You Freestyle comes after Stormzy declared that he still 'wholeheartedly' loves Maya earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Stormzy's new romance with Victoria's Secret model Yasmine Holmgren is going from strength to strength as it was revealed last month that the pair enjoyed a secret reunion in London once lockdown ended.

Swedish-born beauty Yasmine flew straight to Stormzy's home city as soon as travel restrictions were lifted, and was introduced to the musican's friends and family at his birthday celebrations last month.

Comes with the territory: Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it’s like, "This is this, it’s everybody’s business"'

Stormzy and Yasmine were first linked in March after meeting backstage at his gig in Stockholm.

The rapper had been performing at the Annexet arena in Stockholm and reportedly crossed paths with Yasmine backstage, with sources claiming the pair then spent two days together in a hotel in the city.

The global pandemic soon put a stop to any future plans to meet up though, with Yasmine remaining in Stolkholm during lockdown and Stormzy returning to London when his tour dates were cancelled.

As soon as she could, Yasmine flew to London with an insider telling The Sun: 'Yasmine is smitten with Stormzy but they are taking it slow. Lockdown made it a lot harder to see each other but she flew into London as soon as she could.'

'She stayed with him for a few days and met his friends at his birthday party. She was even allowed to walk his dogs, which are his pride and joy.'

'Stormzy likes to keep his ­relationships out of the spotlight and as he gets closer to Yasmine, they will move even further under the radar.'

'When she was around, nothing was posted on social media and she kept a very low profile. But they make a nice match and everyone hopes this could go the distance.'
