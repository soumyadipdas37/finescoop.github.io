She made her red carpet debut with new billionaire boyfriend Jacob Busch at Prince Albert's Planetary Health Gala earlier on in the week.

And as well as her new romance, Rebel Wilson, 40, flaunted her incredible 18kg weight loss in a short Boomerang clip shared to her Instagram on Sunday.

After attending an art exhibit at the Villa Paloma Monaco in Monte-Carlo with her toyboy beau, 29, the Australian comedian offered her followers a further glimpse of her stunning form-fitting V-neck fuchsia pink dress.

Rebel looked positively glowing in the eye-catching dress which featured statement sleeves and a chic collar.

With her locks styled in a bouffant bun and a sultry coat of make-up, Rebel looked every inch the Hollywood bombshell.

The Pitch Perfect star's dazzling look for the evening highlighted her newly slimline figure.

Rebel has drastically slimmed down this year after embarking on a health and fitness journey in January.

Meanwhile, earlier in the evening, Rebel and her boyfriend Jacob met with Prince Albert of Monaco while visiting an exhibit at Villa Paloma Monaco in Monte-Carlo.

Rebel posed up a storm with the 62-year-old royal when appearing at the event for renowned Spanish painter Joan Miró.

The beauty made her red carpet debut with Jacob at a gala in Monaco this week.    

While the Isn't It Romantic star and the beer heir held back on any public displays of affection, they are reportedly 'officially boyfriend and girlfriend.'

'He's a gentleman, has very old school manners and treats her well,' a source told People of their relationship dynamics. 

Speaking of their romance, a source said: 'He's a gentleman, has very old school manners and treats her well. He is also very health conscious and they've been motivating each other with their health journeys'

'He is also very health conscious and they've been motivating each other with their health journeys,' they added.

Jacob's family founded the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which produces America's most popular beer, Budweiser.

In 2016, Forbes listed the Busch family as the 16th richest in America, with a fortune of US$13.4billion.

While it's unclear how much of that will be inherited by Jabob, his current personal net worth has been estimated at US$100million.

At one point, the family even owned their own elephant named Budweiser.

In 2017, the young entrepreneur launched his own beer called Sons Beer with best friends Carlo Mondavi and Elliott Taylor.

Despite branching out on his own, Jacob is still very much involved with his family's charity, the Busch Family Foundation, which benefits the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and The Boys and Girls Club.

Jacob and Rebel's 11-year age gap shouldn't be a problem for the 29-year-old, who previously dated Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, 59.
