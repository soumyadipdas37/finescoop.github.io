Australian sauce and dressing brand Praise has released a new range of flavoured mayonnaises, including a chicken salt option that's causing a stir among hot chip enthusiasts. 

The $4 bottle of sweet and salty mayo, which dropped alongside smokey BBQ, chilli jam and a beetroot style option, claims to be 'chickeney, salty and creamy'.

But there has been a mixed reaction from mayo lovers, particularly those who say this sauce will encourage foodies to 'drown' their potatoes in mayonnaise.

'You're only meant to dip your chips in mayo, not completely cover them like you would with chicken salt,' said one person on Instagram.

'I'm not sure this will taste as good as I want it too,' said another.

But those that have purchased a bottle say they're thrilled with the outcome and will happily repurchase more in the future. 

'Now that we're all cooking from home again here in Victoria - I've been trying out some new recipes! I recently made some rosemary and feta cheese sweet potato chips, which I enjoyed with the chicken salt mayo,' one woman said. 

'Not only is it made with free range eggs, the taste has a kick of Dijon mustard and pairs perfectly with my chunky chippies.'   

'It's like your classic takeaway shop hot chips sprinkled with chicken salt but better,' said another

'It's super tasty, and the combination of chicken salt and mayo makes a unique flavour - a fantastic balance of savoury with a slight sweetness and tang,' said another

A third added: 'It tastes like summer and brightened up the bowl! Hot chips as good as it gets in iso'.

The bottles of special mayonnaise are available at Coles and Woolworths in the sauce and spices aisle.
