Grammy winner Britney Spears' seemingly permanent conservatorship - stemming from her being put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold in 2008 - has reportedly taken its toll on her family members.

The 38-year-old pop star's divorced parents Jamie and Lynne Spears are allegedly 'at war with each other' over what's best for her.

'Jamie has told her that Britney needs long-term monitoring, and he doesn't think she is prepared to take such a drastic action.'

Spears is reportedly more engaged than ever in the legal battle, wanting to unseal details of her conservatorship rather than keep them 'hidden away in a closet as a family secret.'

'Britney is remarkably resilient and is very engaged in the conservatorship, whereas in years prior, she wasn't at all,' the insider added.

'She would never ask questions about it or go to court.'
