The price of meth has skyrocketed in some parts of Australia due to hard border closures making it harder for addicts to afford the illicit drug.

Western Australia's border restrictions has impacted on drug supply chains and prices have soared to between $300-$400 for a 10th of a gram.

It means addicts are increasingly turning to more dangerous alternatives such as heroin, which is cheaper at $150 for a 10th of a gram. 

The state has lost 36 lives to suspected drug overdoses this year alone.

Tom Sullivan from the Australian Institute of Criminology revealed that the price of meth had tripled in the state, making it difficult for addicts to afford. 

'Border restrictions have cut off the supply of methamphetamines and also increased price,' he told 6pr.

'The consequences were a reduction in availability and the cost of methamphetamines was three times higher than it was at beginning of the year.'

Mr Sullivan feared that the under-strain drug market could also see drug addicts overdosing if it suddenly 'bounces back'.  

'There are implications for those not expecting to reduce their use and they may be involuntarily abstaining from methamphetamines which could lower their tolerance,' he said. 

Officers in Operation Zulu, which is led by drug and firearm squad, raided 23 properties across the state last week. 

They seized heroin, meth, LSD, cannabis, guns and about $80,000 cash, and charged 27 people with a total of 61 offences.

Detective Superintendent Tony Longhorn believes that fentanyl was being added to heroin which is making the drug even more fatal.

'There is some suggestion that other drugs like fentanyl are now being used to enhance heroin, creating a potential for further complications and overdoses,' he told The West Australian.

'When drug users switch from using a synthetic stimulant, like meth, to a powerful opioid depressant, such as heroin, and have no awareness as to the purity of the substance, there is a significant risk of accidental overdose which can lead to death.' 

Det-Sen. Sgt Matt Froude is hoping last week's raids will help give an insight into the Perth drug market. 

'We are trying to seize as much as we can and then further to that glean more intelligence as to how we can intercept it and who's getting it in and where.'  

Perth was the second capital city to have the highest consumption of heroin, with Melbourne in first place according to the National Wastewater Drug Monitoring Program report.
