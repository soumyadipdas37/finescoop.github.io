Rebel Wilson has been on a health and fitness journey so far this year, losing at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone).

And on Thursday, the Australian actress took a day off from training to enjoy a pampering session in Los Angeles.

The 40-year-old comedian showed off her slimmed-down frame while visiting a skincare spa.

The Isn't It Romantic star looked stylish in a striped T-shirt and black leggings, which she paired with flat shoes and a handbag.

She concealed her gaze behind cat-eye sunglasses, styled her hair in a ponytail with a scrunchie, and also wore a face mask.

Last month, Rebel updated fans on her weight loss journey by sharing several photos to Instagram of herself looking slimmer in a tight blue dress.

The Bridesmaids star explained in the caption that she was inching closer and closer to her goal weight of 75kg (165lbs, or 11.8 stone).

'Thanks for all the love so far on my "Year of Health" journey,' she told her followers.

'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself 'hmmmm...better not' and had a bottle of water instead.'

'Eight kilos to go until I hit my goal. Hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'

Rebel announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.

'So for me 2020 is going to be called the "Year of Health". So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she said.

'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'
