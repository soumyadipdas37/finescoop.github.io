A man is on the run after causing a head-on collision with a mother and her infant son before stealing a car from a Good Samaritan who stopped to help. 

Police believe the man crossed the centre line as he turned a corner before crashing head-on with another car on State Highway 11 near Kawakawa in New Zealand at 8:20am on Monday. 

A 32-year-old mother was driving the other vehicle while her 12-month-old son was sitting in the back seat when the crash occurred. 

After the crash, a couple driving by stopped to help but the unknown man stole their car and fled the scene, leaving them to look after the injured mother and son.

The couple who stopped at the crash scene initially discovered the man had moderate injuries and told him to sit down and wait for the ambulance. 

They then checked on the mother and son, which is when the man got into their silver Nissan Pulsar station wagon and drove off.  

He was last seen driving towards the nearby town of Paihia. 

'At this stage the vehicle, a silver Nissan Pulsar with the registration DPK966, has yet to be located,' Mid North Police Senior Sergeant Phil Le Comte said.
