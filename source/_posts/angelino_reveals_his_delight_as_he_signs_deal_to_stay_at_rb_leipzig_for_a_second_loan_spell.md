Manchester City defender Angelino will return to RB Leipzig after spending the second half of last season on loan at the club.

The left-back joined the Bundesliga club in January and impressed by scoring once and registering five assists in 18 appearances for Julian Nagelsmann's side. 

Leipzig have re-signed the 23-year-old on a season-long loan that will include an appearance-based obligation to buy for £16million. 

Manchester City defender Angelino will return to RB Leipzig for a season-long loan next term

The obligation to buy will be triggered if Angelino makes 12 appearances for the club, with five of those coming in the second half of the season. 

Should Leipzig chose to feature Angelino for the stipulated number of game, the club will land the Spaniard permanently on a four-year deal until 2025.  

Speaking of the deal, Angelino told RB Leipzig's official website that he is delighted to have put pen to paper with the Bundesliga club. 

'I'm delighted to be staying in Leipzig and that we carry on our journey together.'

However, his loan deal does contain an obligation to buy for £16m at the end of the season

He scored once and registered five assists in 18 appearances for Julian Nagelsmann's side

'My first six months with RBL have been amazing; I got lots of game time straightaway and I really like the coach and the team's approach.

'We also had really successful Bundesliga and Champions League campaigns. I'm very much looking forward to the future and lots more success.'

While, RB Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche added: 'Angel hasn't needed much time to settle in with us and he's understood our brand of football from the start.

'He did really well in the Ruckrunde and also helped us achieve our goals in the Champions League. 

'He's made a great impact with us. That's why we're so pleased that he'll be wearing an RB Leipzig shirt for at least another season.'

Angelino is likely to feature for Leipzig on September 20 when they host Mainz and play an ever present role in their 2020-2021 European campaign.
