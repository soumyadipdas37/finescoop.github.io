On Tuesday's episode of The Block, lockdown hits the Melbourne set and the contestants are left in shock. 

The episode, filmed in March, sees host Scott Cam reveal that while the building set will stay open, social distancing and other guidelines will have to be brought in. 

The Blockheads are then gathered for a special announcement about major changes on the show.

Scott tells them that they can invite their children and families on set - and the show will fund it all. 

Airfares would be covered, and a school house would be built for little ones to study with a tutor.

The generous offer leaves the parents in the group weeping, both over the stress of being parted from their loved ones by border closures and lockdowns, and the joyful prospect of having them close.

But they have tough decisions to make, and Jimmy, 33, and Tam, 31, from Brisbane, wonder if bringing their daughter Frankie, four, to set is a good idea. 

'We haven't seen Frankie in five weeks. Your heart is saying get her here, get here here,' Jimmy said. 

'But she's safe where she is in Noosa. We had to talk about it a lot and figure out what the best thing for her is. '   

For Daniel, 35 and Jade, 34, from South Australia, there was no decision to make - instead the farmers were left weeping when they realised they could not have their family with them despite the generous offer.

'There's four grandparents involved, three little kids. So it's not easy to say it's a great idea,' Daniel said. 

Jade added: 'They have a family farm, a business that runs, that doesn't stop. If it stops, its gone.' 

However, the pair judged that it was 'impossible' for them to have their family leave the farm and stay on set. 

Breaking down, Jade added: 'It's not easy. We'd love to have our kids here with us. We'd love to have them here every day.'  

No option: For Daniel, 35 and Jade, 34, from South Australia, there was no decision to make - instead the farmers were left weeping when they realised they could not have their family with them despite the generous offer due to the family farm needing tending
