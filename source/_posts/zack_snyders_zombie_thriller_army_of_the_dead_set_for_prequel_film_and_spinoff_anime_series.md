Army of the Dead already has a prequel film and anime TV series in the works, despite the original movie not set for release until 2021.

The Zack Snyder directed film takes place after a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas and focuses on a group of mercenaries who take the ultimate gamble by venturing into a quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted.

'I’m incredibly excited for the opportunity to partner with Netflix again as we expand the Army of the Dead universe,' the 54-year-old Justice League director told Deadline.

Army of the Dead stars Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Ana De La Reguera, Theo Rossi, Huma Qureshi, Omari Hardwick, Hiroyuki Sanada, Garret Dillahunt, Matthias Schweighöfer, Raúl Castillo, Nora Arnezeder, and Samantha Win. 

The prequel film will delve deeper into the past of one of the Army of the Dead characters, Ludwig Dieter, played by Schweighöfer.

The film will be produced in Germany, according to Deadline.

Meanwhile the anime series, titled Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas, 'chronicles the origin story of Scott (Bautista) and his rescue crew during the initial fall of Vegas as they confront the mysterious source of the zombie outbreak.'

Army Of The Dead is being tabbed as the spiritual sequel to Snyder's 2004 hit, Dawn Of The Dead, that starred Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber and Mekhi Phifer. 

Last month, it was announced Tig Notaro is replacing Chris D’Elia in the movie, despite principal shooting being wrapped since late last year.

To pull off the change so late in the production, director Zack Snyder will have to do a number of reshoots and use some computer graphics techniques, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

D'Elia's ouster from the all-star international cast comes about two months after he was accused of sexual harassment, grooming, and solicitation of nude photos by multiple underage girls. 

Notaro, who's best known as a stand-up comedian, most recently starred in the CBS: All Access series Star Trek: Discovery and the drama film Lucy In The Sky.

For her role in Army Of The Dead, she will reshoot her scenes with an acting partner against a green screen, and then be inserted into the film with CGI.
