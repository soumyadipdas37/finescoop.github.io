Hitachi is set to ditch plans for a power station in North Wales, in another major setback for Britain's ailing nuclear programme.

The Japanese industrial giant bought the site on Anglesey eight years ago for just under £700million.

But the £20billion scheme was mothballed in January 2019 after it failed to secure Government cash and was not prepared to continue ploughing in its own money.

Axed: Hitachi is set to ditch plans to build a planned power station on the island on the island of Anglesey in North Wales 

But it kept on a skeleton staff at Anglesey and continued to seek planning permission.

According to reports yesterday Hitachi is ready to pull the plug.

The Government declined to comment but critics said the decision leaves Britain's nuclear energy policy, seen as key to hitting carbon emissions targets and helping to power millions of electric cars, in disarray.

And there are now concerns about the future of other nuclear projects, including Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Norfolk.

Cameron Gilmour, at The Sizewell C Consortium, which represents over 100 firms and trade unions, said: 'Anglesey would have been an important milestone for the UK's nuclear supply chain and would have created thousands of jobs. 

'There is now a serious risk to the future of the UK's civil nuclear construction capability.'

Hinkley Point in Somerset is the only nuclear power station being built in the UK but it is over budget and behind schedule.
