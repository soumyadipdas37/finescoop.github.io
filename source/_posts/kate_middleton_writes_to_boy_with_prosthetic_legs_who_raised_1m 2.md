'It was wonderful to hear how you were inspired by Captain Sir Tom Moore's story to carry out your own walk. I am very impressed that you carried on even after reaching your target of 10km!

I know that your efforts have been hugely appreciated by Eveline, and we are all so proud of what you have achieved.'

I hope that you manage to have a very well deserved rest before starting on your next adventure - whatever that may be!

Catherine.'

Tony Hudgell, five, from West Malling, Kent, has raised more than £1 million for the Evelina London's Children's Hospital in London

He set out to raise £500 for the hospital that saved his life by walking 10km in 30 days.

But his incredible efforts captured the hearts of tens of thousands of people, with a staggering £1,073,121 raised for Evelina London Children's Hospital in just a month.

Tony has had to relearn how to walk on his new prosthetic legs but was determined to follow in the footsteps of his hero Captain Tom Moore.

He hugged his adoptive parents Paula and Mark Hudgell as he crossed the finish line in his home town of West Malling in Kent on 30 June after completing his challenge.

They were joined by friends, family and hospital staff to celebrate Tony's achievement.
