Bachelor dumpee Bella Varelis has unleashed her fury on Locky Gilbert after he broke her heart in the grand finale on Thursday.

The brunette beauty took to Instagram and shared a long caption detailing her brutally honest feelings after their split was aired on national TV.

She began: 'I'm not entirely sure where to even start... When Locky told me he loved me and couldn't wait to make me happy for the rest of my life, I believed him and trusted him wholeheartedly.'

'I believed and trusted him whole heartedly': The Bachelor's Bella Varelis unleashed her fury at Locky Gilbert in an Instagram 

'We connected on so many levels right from the beginning, some you saw, but most you didn't.

'Having three months outside of filming completely changed the aspect of the show, it brought normality to the connection and we grew into what felt like a real relationship,' she wrote.

Despite being the frontrunner to win throughout the entire season, Bella was unceremoniously dumped by Locky in one of the most brutal Bachelor break-ups.

The brunette beauty had her heart broken into a million pieces - leading to her storming off upon hearing he'd chosen to be with her love rival and enemy, Irena Srbinovska.   

The Bachelor's most BRUTAL break-up: A sobbing Locky Gilbert dumed  Bella Varelis right after saying 'I'm falling in love with you' during Thursday night's drama-filled finale 

Locky burst into tears and gasped for air as he delivered the bad news to Bella, saying he needed 'more certainty' in a relationship. 

'I fell in love with you the first day I saw you, and I saw those big brown eyes,' he said in an emotion-filled speech.

'Like, they just make me go crazy. And, like, when I told you I love you, like, I meant every single word. 

'I know you  don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty.'

Heartbroken: Bella was left devastated with the crippling blow

Upon hearing the news, Bella looked at Locky - who had declared his love for her a day earlier - in utter disbelief. 

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added.

'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me,' she said in shock. 

Horrified: Bella swiftly ran away from The Bachelor, who was still tearful as she left him on his own

After he responded by saying he was in love with her, Bella added: 'Well, why not follow through with a relationship, then?' 

He went on: 'Because I asked you in the pool 'what do you see our next year looking like?' And you were so... I needed a little bit more.'

 Furiously, she responded: 'You can't turn this around on me.'

She then stormed off, stating: 'My God... Can I leave. I'm going.' 

Heartbroken: Bella then ran away in tears, still shaken over what had just happened

Tearfully venting in the car on her way home, a devastated Bella said: 'He doesn't love me. If he loved me, he'd wanna be with me.

'Who does that to someone who tells them they're in love with them and then...?'

Through tears, she said: 'I just wanna get outta here.'

Thursday night was one of the most tense finales The Bachelor has ever seen, as Locky claimed he was in love with both finalists before making his choice.  

Shocked:  Tearfully venting in the car on her way home, a devastated Bella said: 'He doesn't love me. If he loved me, he'd wanna be with me'
