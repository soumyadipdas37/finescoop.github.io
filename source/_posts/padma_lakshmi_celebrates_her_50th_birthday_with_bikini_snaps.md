Padma Lakshmi made a splash as she celebrated her milestone 50th birthday on Monday.

The Top Chef star shared two bikini snaps on her Instagram account, along with a powerful message reflecting on the events of this past year.

The first photo Padma shared was one of herself holding a starfish as she stood on the beach wearing a colorful two-piece.

The Hulu star looked absolutely amazing as she stood at the waters edge with her line of vision towards the ocean animal.

In the second snap, Padma played around in the pool with her partner Adam Dell and their daughter Krishna, 10.

Padma raised her arm high up into the air as she gazed towards her daughter, who stood upon her father.

Padma's lengthy caption detailed the mixed emotions she had been grappling with this past year amid the pandemic.

From the highs to the lows, Padma candidly described them all.

While admitting just how fortunate she has been, she acknowledged 2020 has been a painful year for so many.   

'Birthday thoughts,' she began with a cloudy sun emoji. 'This year has been a mix of misery and elation.

'The whole world was swallowed up by the plague In March. We were lucky but so many weren’t and I felt an impending doom, a creeping anxiety I could not shake.

'Then another Black life was taken and it was good that we all rose up- but so painful too. So painful that some of our fellow Americans could not even bring themselves to say that Black lives matter, some who hold our highest offices.'

'But personally, at home things were peaceful. We made a cocoon for our family. We lived for the first time-all under one roof. We became closer.

'And professionally, I finally got to show the world what I would do if I got to build a show from scratch. "Taste the Nation" was well received beyond my wildest dreams, 100% even on rotten tomatoes!

'But the best of all was hearing how all of you felt when you watched it, reading how families watched together.

'The episode with my mother and littlehands felt like a tribute to all my mother and millions of other immigrant parents had sacrificed.

'I cannot ask for anything more. I am truly blessed: a loving and attentive partner, a child that continues to be a miracle every day and work that I am proud of and fully engaged by with people I love.

Hit show: Lakshmi stars in the new Hulu series Taste The Nation

'I am today very lucky. But I am also a product of the toil and troubles my younger self endured. And I thank that version of me.

'Thank you all so much for joining me on this trip. I have loved sharing it with all of you everyday (even the Trump supporters) #thisis50 #virgoseason.'

Padma rose to stardom as the host of the hit Bravo competition show, Top Chef, for which she was nominated for an Emmy. 

Nowadays she is on Hulu as the host of yet another food-oriented show, Taste The Nation.

'The show was really just an extension of my advocacy work and I hope it’s a way to advocate for these communities, while being informative and teaching people something, but also just being entertaining,' she previously told Us Weekly.
