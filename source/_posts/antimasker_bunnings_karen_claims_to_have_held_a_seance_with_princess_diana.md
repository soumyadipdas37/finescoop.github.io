An anti-masker dubbed 'Bunnings Karen' has claimed she has summoned the spirit of Princess Diana in a seance, saying she feels the late royal's 'energy'.

Lizzy Rose posted a Facebook update on Monday where she claimed to have had a spiritual encounter with the late princess to ask questions of her life and secrets of the coronavirus pandemic.

The self-declared priestess said she asked Diana 33 questions in their meeting, including if she is still alive, what she thinks of Meghan Markle and whether Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was 'unsound'.

'I have worked with her energy most of my life whilst she was living and since her public death,' Ms Rose's post reads.

'I am working with her energy and essence to gain the answers that we seek.'

Other questions included whether or not the Freedom Day March would go ahead on September 5, and what measures it will take to end the 'tyranny' in Victoria.

'Is there a matrix hack we can use to unbind the police from the dark magic so they stand with the people on the day of the protest?' one of Ms Rose's questions reads.

Ms Rose said her seance with the princess was 'lengthy' with the 'psychic channellings' set to be released on video on Tuesday evening. 

Ms Rose was dubbed 'Bunnings Karen' after she made headlines last month when she filmed herself clashing with staff at the hardware giant over mandatory face masks.

She uses her social media platform to spread dangerous conspiracy theories, including a video of a 'vaccination burn' to cast out Mr Andrews and the Victorian government.

'Cast you and your agenda out. We say no to mandatory vaccinations against our will,' she said in the footage.

'We burn away your evil agenda. We, the awakened people, say no to mandatory vaccinations. We cast you out.'



Ms Rose has also uploaded footage burning face masks. 

Melbourne is currently under Stage Four coronavirus restrictions, which includes the mandatory wearing of face masks to stop the spread of the disease.  

Police have the power to issue $200 on the spot fines for anyone who breaches the face mask mandate. 

Face masks help to cut the transmission of coronavirus by catching droplets of saliva at the mouth and nose, and they can also help stop people from becoming infected from the aerosolised droplet of others.

Medical research published in the medical journal The Lancet last month found face masks were 77 per cent effective at stopping infection, while respirators were 96 per cent effective.

Victoria recorded 70 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday and five deaths.

Ms Rose famously recorded herself inside the Bunnings store in Maribyrnong, in Melbourne's west, where she planned to buy plant pots and items for her 'Viking fire pit'
