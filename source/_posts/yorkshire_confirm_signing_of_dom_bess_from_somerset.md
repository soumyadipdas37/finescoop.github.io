Yorkshire have confirmed the signing of England off-spinner Dom Bess, a move exclusively revealed by Sportsmail last week.

The 23-year-old, who spent two temporary spells at Headingley in 2019, returns permanently on a four-year deal after rejecting a new contract offer from Somerset.

Bess, who has made eight of his 10 career Test appearances in 2020, could yet make his farewell appearance in the Bob Willis Trophy final later this month - with Somerset well positioned to top the midlands group and qualify - before re-locating north ahead of next summer.

'Hopefully, the opportunities I can get at Yorkshire will develop my learning to kick on and play international cricket for a long time,' Bess said.

'That is the ultimate goal, but I also want to be part of a Yorkshire side that are again winning championships.

'I want us to be pushing for one day and T20 success as well. Last year, I certainly got the hint that the club want to push for the T20 and 50 over competition.

'I think that it is a great opportunity for me to develop my white-ball skills and show that I'm a three-dimensional player.'

Martyn Moxon, Yorkshire's director of cricket, said: 'Dom has shown his quality and potential this year with England, and made a huge impression at Yorkshire during his loan spell last season.

'His signing will bolster our spin options but will also give us more batting depth down the order.'

Bess follows fast bowler Jamie Overton, who is Surrey-bound, in opting for a new challenge from 2021 onwards.
