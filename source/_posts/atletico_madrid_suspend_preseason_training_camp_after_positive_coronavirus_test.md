Atletico Madrid's pre-season plans have reportedly been thrown into chaos after the club were forced to suspend their training camp due to a positive coronavirus test. 

The LaLiga club have been gearing up for the new season in San Rafael as per tradition, but will now have to beat a hasty retreat back to Madrid to undergo a further round of testing.

According to Marca, a member at the club, who is not a player or on the coaching staff, returned the positive result after a mandatory round of checks was held at the team hotel on Thursday.

The individual will now be forced to enter a 14-day period of self-isolation, and the rest of Atletico's travelling party will also need to be given a clean bill of health again. 

It has been claimed that the member who tested positive is likely to have contracted the disease from his family environment, rather than as a result of attending the training camp. 

The squad were due to stay on the site until their last session was held on Saturday morning.

Diego Simeone will be unable to resume training until the latest results are made available

Atletico will be unable to decide when to resume training until the latest results are made available.

Their first game of the new campaign was initially against Sevilla but, due to their opponents' success in the Europa League last month, the clash was postponed.

Diego Simeone's side will instead kick off their return to domestic action with a home clash against Granada on September 27.
