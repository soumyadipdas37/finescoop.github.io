She's currently single after splitting with Bachelorette winner Carlin Sterritt. 

And now former Gogglebox star Angie Kent has revealed that she's pansexual. 

The 30-year-old appeared on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O on Wednesday when she said she 'falls in love with a person, not the gender.'

'I fall in love with a person, not the gender': The Bachelorette star Angie Kent revealed on the Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday that she's PANSEXUAL, but admitted she's never been with a woman

'Have you ever been with a woman?' shock jock Kyle Sandilands asked Angie. 

'No, I haven't, but I always said that I'd fall in love with a person, not the gender,' Angie replied. 

He then asked if she's 'open to women,' when Angie said that she is. 

Cheeky: She added that she's kissed women before, and joked it's because she hails from the Sunshine Coast

'Yeah of course I have, it's the thing to do back on the Sunshine Coast. There's nothing else to do. I've always said since I was younger, I fall in love with a soul rather than a gender.'

Jackie O then asked Angie if she's pansexual, when Angie confirmed she is. 

A pansexual person is attracted to someone or falls in love with them regardless of their biological sex or gender identity. 

'There you go, I've got a label!' Jackie O then asked Angie if she's pansexual, when Angie confirmed she is

'There you go, I've got a label. I think it comes down to the chemistry,' she said.

The blonde reality star also spoke about her and Carlin's split, saying that they broke up because their 'values didn't align.' 

'I'm more spiritual, carefree and wild, whereas he's a Christian boy. We're just different,' Angie said. 

Carlin and Angie dated for about 10 months before calling it quits in early July.

Earlier this month, Carlin revealed his relationship with Angie began to fall apart after he discovered she was texting runner-up Timm Hanly.

The 32-year-old personal trainer told the How to Life podcast that the pair's bond made him feel insecure, even though he pretended to be okay with it at first.

'She really cared for Tim. They were kind of messaging a little bit afterwards. I was trying to play it cool, like "it's fine, it's all good,"' Carlin began.

Despite telling Angie he didn't mind her staying in contact with Timm, Carlin's self-confidence plummeted when he discovered their friendly texts.

'I was trying to be nice and I was trying to do the right thing,' he said.

'And then more and more, her and Timm messaging each other, it just started to really eat me away.'
