Helen Skelton has insisted she 'doesn't take online trolls seriously' as she documents her life and home renovations on Instagram.

The presenter, 37, told MailOnline that having been in the TV industry for many years she's learned not to take online abuse seriously, but hinted that some social media stars aren't prepared for the perils of being on the platform.

Helen's chat came after she collaborated with Highland Spring to travel to Scotland and learn about the origins of naturally-sourced water, and said that she was 'pleasantly surprised' to learn so little is done before the water reaches the bottle. 

EXCLUSIVE: Helen Skelton, 37, has insisted she 'doesn't take online trolls seriously' as she documents her life and home renovations on Instagram

Helen told MailOnline that although she enjoys documenting her family life on social media, she's learned not to spend too much time thinking about trolls.

She said: 'I don't take any of it seriously, I love Instagram I literally love Instagram. I've been able to find so many quirky furniture makers, I've go these really cool concrete sinks, so I've been able to find loads of stuff and that's what I take from it. 

'In the nicest possible way, I've been on telly since 2005 so most of what could be said about me has been said about me, you get used to people having an opinion.

'I think what's unfortunate is that when you're public eye everyone has an opinion, but I think because so many people are social media famous, they get really upset and are like 'oh my god that person I don't know just sl****d me off!' 

Speaking out: The presenter told MailOnline she's learned not to take online abuse seriously, but hinted some social media stars aren't prepared for the perils of being on the platform

'And I'm like ''that's what it's like they're gonna do that. I just don't think you can take of that stuff too seriously, as long as you can smile at your kids and walk over the threshold.'

Adding she'd 'go mad' if she spent too much time focusing on how her online fans view her, Helen said she's well aware the fans only see a fraction of her life on Instagram.

'You'd literally go mad if you worried about what people you don't know say about you. about the stuff that people. I underestimate how many people see it. But the funny thing is that people overthink social media.'  

Candid: Helen added that she's found lockdown easier than expected, as her two sons Ernie, five, and Louis, three, enjoy spending time outdoors

Helen also discussed how she's adjusted to living in lockdown with her husband Richie Myler, and their sons Ernie, five, and Louis, three.

The Countryfile host admitted she'd found lockdown easier than expected, given her children enjoy spending time outdoors.

She said: 'I am so lucky I've got a three and a five-year-old who are feral, because they are quite happy climbing trees and jumping in streams and that's what we've done in lockdown, where we live is quite green, we're on the edge of a wood. 

'I have really enjoyed lockdown, I know it's awful to say because some people have had a difficult time, but I'm one of these people whose glasses are always half-full, so I thank my stars my kids are 3 and 5, if you have teenagers you've got a real fight on your hands, and if you've got 10 y/o's you know yohave gotta to homework. 

'My oldest is in Reception, so the pressure to homeschool was not, I probably should have felt pressured but I didn't! 

'I just feel really lucky the kids are the age they are because they could just enjoy being at home with mum and dad.

Journey: Helen's chat came after she collaborated with Highland Spring to travel to Scotland and learn about the origins of naturally-sourced water

'I need to be careful what I say as I don't want to sound smug cos obviously it's been really s**t for a lot of people, so I'm just so grateful they're the age they are.' 

'I mean, my kids, there's probably not a tree in Leeds my kids haven't climbed during lockdown!'

Helen has joined forces with Highland Spring to learn about the sustainable journey of naturally sourced water, and in particular how it can benefit the environment, as 100% of Highland Spring's bottles are made from recycled plastic.

She said: 'It was very very wet and wild and windy but I kind of like that, I sort of love that really. I'm really lucky I get to some amazing parts of the UK with my word, and when Highland Spring invited me up I thought 'this will be nice!'

'I didn't expect to be as enlightening as it was. I get it, water falls from the sky, falls from the hills, it's got old and we drink it and I didn't appreciate how little of the human hand is done to the actual water… no human hands touch that water until we actually get it in the bottle so I was pleasantly surprised.'

Eye-opening: The former Blue Peter host admitted she didn't expect the journey to be so 'eye-opening' as she learned how water makes it from the spring to the bottle

'Sustainability is such a buzz word at the minute and I think everyone is aware of the climate crisis, but alongside that everyone has lives to lead and mouths to feed and bills the pay, but sometimes people don't know how to do their bit

'This is one way of being able to do your bit and I just think it's really important as well, we can bang on about sustainability, but what does that actually mean? 

'How can that relate to everyday people and I think what's the story of this water is keen to the sustainability story, the team look after the land, look after the water so they don't have to have those big processed or system, and I think the story is an easy way explain sustainability, just letting nature do its thing.'

Travelling: She added: 'It was very very wet and wild and windy but I kind of like that, I sort of love that really'
