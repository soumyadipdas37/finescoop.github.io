Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker is set for her very own journey through time as she leads the star-studded lineup for a brand new series of BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? 

The actress will join Gavin and Stacey's Ruth Jones, Britain's Got Talent judge David Walliams and Silent Witness' Liz Carr in discovering secrets about her family history in the series which will air next month.

While the new series will be packed with surprises, it will also offer some grim truths about stars' pasts, with Jodie also learning some grim truths about her ancestors.  

Learning about the past: Doctor Who's Jodie Whittaker is set for her very own journey through time as she leads the star-studded lineup for a brand new series of Who Do You Think You Are?

Jodie - known to many for her roles in Doctor and Broadchurch - learns the  emotional truth about a long-questioned family myth, surrounding her great uncle's sacrifice in WWI.

The star is also set to find out the grim history of her great-great grandfather and the life he led in Yorkshire, in the series which was filmed pre-lockdown.

She says: 'Who Do You Think You Are? took me on an incredible journey through some of my family history. I discovered people and events that I had no idea existed before this. 

'I was lucky to go home and see my Mum and Dad, lucky to see places I'd never been to before, and lucky to meet and shake hands with (!) some wonderful and intelligent people whose insight into history blew my mind. 

Exciting: The actress will join Gavin and Stacey's Ruth Jones for the four-part series, which sees stars learn uncovered secrets about their ancestors

'And only in February did I embark on this journey, and knowing where we are now, it feels even more special to have had this adventure.'

Meanwhile David - one of the nations most beloved comedians - will learn that entertaining is a family trait, after discovering his great-great grandfather forged a career as a travelling performer after becoming blind.

However - in one of the series' more tearful moments - he also uncovers the tragic story behind his paternal great grandfather's experiences following WWI. 

He says: 'I'm delighted to have taken part in the series. I started off the journey knowing very little about my ancestry. 

'In making the programme I found out lots of family history I would never would have learned of. I was pleased to discover that being an entertainer runs in the family.'

Coming soon: BGT judge David Walliams will also appear in the new series, discovering that the art of entertaining is a generational trait

Ruth learns she has a surprise connection to the National Health Service, as her paternal grandfather became a key figure in the Medical Aid Societies of South Wales, which acted as a model for UK-wide service known today.  

She says: 'Filming Who Do You Think You Are? was one of the best experiences I've ever had. I feel so privileged to have been taken on this spectacular journey into my heritage and to have discovered so much about my ancestors. 

'I've probably been guilty of assuming people from by-gone generations were stuffy, two dimensional and a bit dull. 

'But my trip on Who Do You Think You Are? has proved the opposite to be true. I feel like I've got to know the real people behind the fading sepia photographs and it's made me want to find out more. Ancestry is where it's at!'

Liz also finds she has an undiscovered connection to The Great War, as she learns about her paternal grandfather's experiences in the Royal Navy's Northern Patrol, and also exposes one of her ancestor's involvements in an attempted murder. 

She says: ''I've watched Who Do You Think You Are? over the years so to be selected to have the show research my family history has been a wonderfully surreal experience. 

'An armchair genealogist, my mum has dragged us around graveyards in search of our ancestors but to no avail so I'm hoping this will now all stop (probably not - knowing my mum!) 

'I have loved every moment of discovery, of following in the footsteps of my ancestors and learning how the past really has informed my present. 

'All of the experts were generous and fascinating as they guided me back in time to introduce me to my family. 

'Before doing Who Do You Think You Are? all I really knew about my ancestors was that they had died but now I know that they lived and how they lived. I like knowing that, I like knowing who they were and I feel very proud to be related to them.' 

Who Do You Think You Are? returns to BBC One this October. 

Star-studded: Rounding out the lineup is Silent Witness' Liz Carr, who also finds an undiscovered connection to The Great War
