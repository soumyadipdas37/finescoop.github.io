Armie Hammer is living and spending time with a family friend following his split with Elizabeth Chambers.

The 34-year-old actor shared a shot of his friend, whose name is Ashton Ramsey, as they embarked on a hike at California's Joshua Tree National Park.

'This one of my best friends, Ashton. For the last 2 months or so I have lived with Ashton, worked construction with Ashton, and hiked with Ashton every day,' the Santa Monica, California native said. 'He has been such a good friend (and boss) and has been the most supportive friend anyone could ever ask for.

'Today might be my birthday, but I just wanna say thank you to @ashtonramsey and say I love you dude.'

The Call Me by Your Name leading man and Chambers, 38, said last month that they were splitting up.

'Thirteen years as best friends, soulmates, partners and then parents. It has been an incredible journey, but together, we’ve decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage,' Chambers and Hammer, who are parents to daughter Harper, five, and son Ford, three, said in a joint statement July 10.

The parted pair said they would remain cordial and friendly in the wake of the parting.

'As we enter into this new chapter, our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority,' they said. 'We understand this news lends itself to public dialogue, but in the interest of our children and our family, we’re asking for privacy, compassion and love during this time.'

Hammer wrote on Instagram of the split: 'Thirteen years as best friends, soulmates, partners and then parents. It has been an incredible journey, but together, we've decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage.'

Chambers, who exchanged vows with the actor in May of 2010, wrote to Hammer, 'You are loved' in an Instagram Stories post on Friday.

In filing for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Chambers cited 'irreconcilable differences' in the relationship; she has asked for primary physical custody and joint legal custody of the kids.

An insider previously told US that the split had been inevitable with the way the couple had drifted apart.

'They have been having trouble in their marriage for quite a while and each doing their own thing,' the source told the outlet of the couple, who had spent the earlier part of the COVID-19 in the lockdown in the Cayman Islands.

A separate source told the outlet that the pair remained focused on parenting amid the tough times, as 'their children are their top priority and always will be.'

The source added, 'Right now, their biggest concern is their children and how this change will impact them ... the split is amicable and they will work through this difficult time with love and respect.'
