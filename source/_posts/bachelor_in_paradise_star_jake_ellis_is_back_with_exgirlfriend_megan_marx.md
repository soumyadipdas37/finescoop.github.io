Bachelor in Paradise star Jake Ellis famously quit this year's season of the show to try and win back his ex-girlfriemd Megan Marx, and, it appears to have worked. 

On Monday, the 34-year-old confirmed the romance by posting a cute snap of the couple to Instagram.  

In the image, Jake was snuggled up to Megan, 31, as they soaked up the sun during a getaway to La Rocher Eco Estate in NSW.

Jake simply captioned the photo with a smiley face and rose emoji.  

Megan appeared mostly makeup free and her cropped blonde locks were down in tousled waves. 

Meanwhile, Jake went topless in the photo, showing off his back tattoo that reads: 'life or death brothers forever'.

Last month, Jake quit Bachelor in Paradise in order to try and win Megan back.

Part way through the rose ceremony, he said: 'I did find love [in Paradise last time] and, if anything, this experience has taught me that I'm still in love.'

'I'm gonna take a chance, I'm gonna go fight for what I love and who I'm in love with.'

Jake later told Who Magazine of his decision to leave: 'Very shortly after I hit the sand I just knew that it didn't feel right. I realised I already had the love I was looking for in my life – with Megan.'

He went on to reveal that they were working towards getting back together.

'[We're] not officially but it's a "watch-this-space" kind of thing right now,' he said.

'We're still very close and we're working towards getting back together. That's the goal but there's a lot going on at the moment so hopefully love prevails.'

The pair met on the first season of Bachelor In Paradise in 2018 and dated for almost 18 months.
