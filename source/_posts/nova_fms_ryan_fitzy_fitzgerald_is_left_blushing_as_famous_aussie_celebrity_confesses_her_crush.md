Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald was left blushing after Marcia Hines confessed she had a crush on him on Monday.

During an interview on Nova FM's radio show Fitzy & Wippa, the singer, 67, told the radio host she first saw him seven years ago and thought he 'had really pretty eyes'.

After Fitzy, 43, introduced Marcia to listeners, she confessed live on air: 'I had such a crush on you.'

'Seriously?' a shocked Fitzy replied. 'Yeah, those gorgeous eyes,' Marcia said.

His co-host Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli asked the singer when she first thought Fitzy was 'a bit of a cutie'.

'I first saw him about seven years ago. I used to see lots of pictures of him and he's got these really pretty eyes and a really great mouth,' she explained.

Meanwhile, Fitzy raised eyebrows last week when he admitted to potentially driving the getaway car after a friend stole a safe.

He explained on his Nova FM radio show Fitzy & Wippa last week: 'I had to pick him up to go to another friend's house. He said "can you come and get me and on the way can you stop at my father-in-law's house because I need to pick something up".' 

He continued: 'I pulled the car over, he jumped out of the car. I watched him jump the back fence and he was gone for 10 to 15 mins.'

'Then all of a sudden the back gate opens and he's got a safe and two plants.'

Fitzy revealed his friend then placed the items in the back of his car and told him to start driving.

'I was in a situation thinking "what do I do now?"'

He said several days later his dad questioned the smell of the plants in his car.

'My old man found out because the plants in the back stunk my whole car out and I was like "Dad I think was accomplish in a robbery".'
