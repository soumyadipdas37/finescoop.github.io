Rihanna was spotted Friday night, sporting a black eye and a bruised face, as she discreetly stopped to pick up dinner at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica. 

The 32-year-old sat in the backseat of her black Cadillac Escalade, as staff brought her a glass of white wine, while she waited for her order.

She subsequently removed her chunky square sunglasses, revealing her shiner under the car's cabin light.

The singer has recently been promoting her groundbreaking new skincare line Fenty Skin, following the massive success of Fenty Beauty.

But the nine-time Grammy winner might be hiding her face for a while, after what appears to have been a nasty accident.

Rihanna later put her shades back on, as she darted to the back of the restaurant, avoiding attention from patrons.

Her rep told TMZ she was 'on an e-scooter a few days ago and ate it after the scooter flipped over, smacking her in the face and forehead.'

Her rep told TMZ she was 'on an e-scooter a few days ago and ate it after the scooter flipped over, smacking her in the face and forehead.' It comes after Simon Cowell had surgery last month, after breaking his back 'in a few places' during an accident on an electric bicycle

RiRi's accident was met with speculation of a physical altercation, after she was assaulted by then boyfriend Chris Brown in February of 2009

Rihanna's accident comes after just weeks after a similar incident where Simon Cowell was rushed to hospital after breaking his back after falling off an e-bike.

The TV star underwent surgery last month, after breaking his back 'in a few places'.

The images of RiRi's injuries were met with speculation of a physical altercation, after she was assaulted by then-boyfriend Chris Brown in February of 2009.

Brown, 31, took a plea deal, for which he was given five years probation and ordered to stay 50 yards away from Rihanna.

The Love on the Brain artist subsequently dropped the restraining order in 2011, and they briefly got back together in 2012. 

A 2012 interview with Rihanna recently resurfaced on the podcast Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations, in which she discussed her undying bond with Brown.

She said: 'We've been working on our friendship again. Now we're very very close friends. We've built up a trust again, and that's — we love each other and we probably always will. 

'And that's not something we're ever going to change. That's not something you can shut off, if you've ever been in love.'

Confusion over the fact that the interview was not conducted recently led fans to believe the couple might be rekindling their flame.

A source has since told HollywoodLife: 'The chance of them rekindling the love they had would be as close to impossible as things could be. They were once in a relationship that was all or nothing, and it ended.

'They won’t dive into something like that again with each other. They know that it wouldn’t be healthy for all the progress they have made.'  

The insider added: 'So now that everyone is talking about them again, so be it. They are looking for it to subside and they both will continue with their lives as it has been, which they are very happy about. They have proven that they can move on, they just hope others can do the same.'

Rihanna has most recently sparked relationship rumors with A$AP Rocky, 31, after her two-year relationship with Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, 31, ended back in January. 

But she's been keeping busy with her long-overdue ninth studio album, her recently-released Fenty Skin line and her $25million documentary, due out next summer.
