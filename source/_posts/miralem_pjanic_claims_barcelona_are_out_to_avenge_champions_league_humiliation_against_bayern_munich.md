Miralem Pjanic is ready to be a driving force in Barcelona's regeneration this season, aiming to put their Bayern Munich crisis firmly in the past. 

The Bosnian completed a surprise £54m move to the Nou Camp this summer, ejected from Juventus' own revamp under Andrea Pirlo. 

The 30-year-old went the opposite way to Luis Suarez, Arthur, Nelson Semedo, Ivan Rakitic, Arda Turan, Arturo Vidal and managed Quique Seiten - who were all cleared out following Barca's 8-2 collapse against the Germans at the Champions League semi-finals in Portugal.

The defeat was one of the most humiliating in the club's history, sparking protests against the club's board and a transfer request from the great Lionel Messi - who eventually opted to stay and aim for a fightback in 2020-21. 

'This team wants to take revenge for what happened in Lisbon and show that it was a huge accident,' Pjanic told Sport. 

'Our goal is to go step by step: starting with the league, which will not be easy. And in the Champions League, there will be five or six candidates to win the trophy.

'Starting in March, a new season will begin within the season itself, with the knockout stages of the Champions League and the decisive stretch of the league championship; that's where we have to be at full throttle.

Pjanic believes the club can quickly bounce back after a miserable season in 2019-20 

The midfielder has a successful history in Italy before he was moved-on by Juve this summer 

'These players have already earned the respect of the football world and I don't think they have to prove anything to anyone. But in football there are accidents, and I don't think there is a Barca player who doesn't want to show that 8-2 was just that, an accident.

'I do not have any doubt. I have spoken with some of them and they have not lost an ounce of self-confidence. Last year was not easy for anyone, but I am sure that this year we will have a good season, because we have good players.

'Nothing is easy in today's game. We know that Barca is undergoing changes, perhaps the newcomers will need some time to adapt, but we will succeed.' 

The 30-year-old has come in while the likes of Luis Suarez and Nelson Semedo have left 

The Catalans get their season underway on Sunday with Villarreal visiting their iconic stadium, with new boss Ronald Koeman set to feel the pressure from day one. 

Pjanic is the most expensive of four signings so far, with Trincao arriving from Braga, Matheus Fernandes from Palmerias and Pedri from Las Palmas for a total of £92m so far this summer. 

The Bosnian star spent nine years in Italy with Roma and Juventus after emerging in Ligue 1 with Metz and Lyon, with the reliable midfield engine only failing to reach 30 league appearances twice in his career, in 2008-09 and 2012-13.
