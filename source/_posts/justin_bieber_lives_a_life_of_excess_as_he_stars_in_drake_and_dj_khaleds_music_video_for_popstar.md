The coronavirus pandemic made it difficult for Drake and DJ Khaled  to film a music video for their hit song Popstar. 

But the God's Plan singer and Wild Thoughts hitmaker enlisted the help of Justin Bieber for their video, released Thursday night. 

The 26-year-old, who is name dropped in the song, lives a life of extreme excess in his starring role, only to find out it was all a dream, or so he thought.  

Popstar: Drake and DJ Khaled enlisted the help of Justin Bieber to star in the music video for their song Popstar, released Thursday night

The video opens with DJ Khaled self recording dozens of videos with ideas for the Popstar music video and sending them to Drake. 

'We have to shoot the Popstar video,' the producer says. 'I know the boarders closed, they won't let me in the country, what do you want me to do? The song is too big. We have to shoot the video. We have to figure something out.' 

The videos of Khaled overlap into an almost indistinguishable mix of his ideas. 

'Khaled man, this guy's off his rocker,' Drake says exasperated opening the videos. 'I don't know what to say...It's like you someone everything that you have and they're like "anotha one. (sic)"'

Wild night: The song starts rolling over film of people passed out in the hallways of a mansion, leading to Justin waking up in bed as he sings to the song 

Called in a favor: It seems Drake 'called in a favor' to get Justin to star in the video 

'I can't do a video,' Drake says. 'I can't even leave the country and this guy wants me to do a video for him. There's one thing I can do for sure but I'm gonna have to call in a favor though.' 

The song starts rolling over film of people passed out in the hallways of a mansion, leading to Justin waking up in bed as he sings to the song. 

Justin walks down the hallways followed by a large security guard, with a bottle of champagne in his hand and diamond chains on his neck. 

He gets downstairs to the party still going on and he quickly makes himself comfortable in between two young ladies.

Cameo: As Drake raps 'I'm a popstar, but this shit ain't bubblegum, yeah / You would probably think my manager is Scooter Braun,' the manager makes his perfectly times entrance

Justin heads upstairs to find people dancing, as he has a stylist undress and dress him quickly. 

He then heads to a studio with a red backdrop as the lyrics continue 'Crown in my hand and I'm really playin' keep-away / Shit don't even usually get this big without a Bieber face.' 

The Baby singer continues to enjoy the house party, dancing in the driveway with friends and sitting poolside in a large blue fur coat.

Just a dream: As the song ends, Justin is once again waking up but this time he is not in a house filled with people but in bed next to his wife Hailey Bieber, telling her about the party-filled dream

Or was it: While out on their walk, Justin pauses as his phone rings and 'DRAKE' appears on the screen 

As the song ends, Justin is once again waking up but this time he is not in a house filled with people but in bed next to his wife Hailey Bieber. 

'You okay?' the 23-year-old model asks. 'I had a crazy dream. Drake asked me to be in a video, but he wasn't in the video it was just a bunch of people,' Justin says shaking his head. 

He turns to his wife and says 'I love you,' before suggesting they take their dog out for a walk. 

While out on their walk, Justin pauses as his phone rings and 'DRAKE' appears on the screen.
