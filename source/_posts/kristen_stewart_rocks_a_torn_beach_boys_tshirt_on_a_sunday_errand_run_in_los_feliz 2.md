She shocked fans yet again with her latest selection of film role. 

And Kristen Stewart – soon to play Princess Diana of Wales – was seen making a stop at a pet store on Sunday while out running errands with a friend in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles, California.

Stewart, 30, wore a weathered white Beach Boys t-shirt for the outing, shredded at the waist allowing for a hint of midriff to peek through.

The Seberg star rolled up the short sleeves of the tee, which featured a Statue of Liberty illustration over an American flag.

She matched the top with a pair of cream corduroy pants, which she also rolled up at the cuffs.

On her feet, Kristen wore black socks in what appeared to be matching sandals. 

The Panic Room actress's blond hair was grown out with dark roots, and she wore layered silver chain necklaces along with an assortment of rings and bracelets.

That film, written by Dirty Pretty Things scribe Steven Knight and directed by Jackie helmer Pablo Larraín, will follow Princess Di – nee Diana Spencer – as she makes the decision to divorce husband Charles.

Sunday's sighting of Kristen comes two days after she was seen on a grocery run with girlfriend of one year, Dylan Meyer. 

The Twilight star and the screenwriter were first linked in August 2019, about a month after Stewart split for good from model Stella Maxwell after a two-year relationship.

Stewart famously dated her Twilight Saga co-star Robert Pattinson and also had an infamous affair with her Snow White And The Huntsman director Rupert Sanders. 

This month, she reportedly put her Malibu beach hideaway back on the market for $9.5million – roughly double what she paid for it in 2011. 

And last year, Kristen was part of the disappointing reboot of Charlie's Angels, along with sci-fi thriller Underwater.
