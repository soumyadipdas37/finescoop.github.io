The Masked Singer suspended filming last month after several dancers tested positive for COVID-19, forcing the cast and crew into quarantine for two weeks.

But for judge Urzila Carlson, that was only the second of three separate quarantines that she had to go through in order to take part in the show.

Speaking to Hughesy & Ed on Wednesday, the 44-year-old New Zealander explained how she's had to spend a total of six weeks in self-isolation.

'I am getting to spend a lot of time with myself,' she said. 

'I finished Pornhub in the last quarantine, so I've got a lot of time,' she added with a laugh.

In order to appear on the Channel 10 program, Urzila had to initially complete two weeks of hotel quarantine upon her arrival in Sydney from New Zealand.

She was then forced to do another two weeks of quarantine in Melbourne after the coronavirus outbreak at Docklands Studios last month.

After this, she flew back to her native New Zealand, where she had to do another two weeks of hotel quarantine in accordance with local COVID-19 laws. 

The zany Channel 10 show had been forced into lockdown on August 22, just hours before the grand finale was scheduled to be filmed.

Seven dancers tested positive for COVID-19, and the show's stars - including Urzila and her fellow judges Dannii Minogue, Dave Hughes and Jackie 'O' Henderson - were ordered to self-isolate immediately.

Host Osher Günsberg and the production team were also told to self-isolate after the outbreak, which coincided with a deadly second wave of the virus in Melbourne. 

The finale was eventually filmed on Tuesday night, with Urzila Zooming in from her hotel in New Zealand while Osher and Jackie filmed their segments from Channel 10's Sydney studios. 

The finale of The Masked Singer will air Monday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
