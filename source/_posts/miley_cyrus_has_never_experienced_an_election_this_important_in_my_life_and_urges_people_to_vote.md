Miley Cyrus has been busy promoting her infectious new track Midnight Sky.

But the 27-year-old superstar put promotion aside on Friday to candidly discuss the importance of heading to the polls and voting in the upcoming United States presidential election.

'Listen I'm 27 and I know I've never experienced an election this important in my life and hopefully not again in my lifetime,' said Cyrus in a recent interview with Nova 96.9′s Fitzy & Wippa.

She went on to explain the power that comes with encouraging others to head to the polls and vote. 

'I can't express the importance enough, especially if young people getting out there and being active and making sure that their friends, their family are voting and have the information about whether it's mailing in, about the state of our country right now.'

Adding in her personal political agenda, Cyrus stated that 'it's just crucial that we get out there and make changes and we have someone fit for the job of running our country.'

The Can't Be Tamed songstress believes that the youth of the nation are more empowered than ever to vote, especially in comparison to the 2016 election between Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. 

Very important: 'Listen I'm 27 and I know I've ever experienced an election this important in my life and hopefully not again in my lifetime,' said Cyrus in a recent interview with Nova 96.9′s Fitzy & Wippa

'I think young people are really stepping up to the plate, really taking charge and getting mobilized working and advocating tirelessly.'

She added: 'I really think so, I think that you know it's kind of Rock bottom here right now.' 

Cyrus thinks that because 'it's desperate times' in the United States, 'people will really step up' and perform their civic duty.

'I don't believe in "don't worry be happy," I believe that worry is healthy. Worry is why we are washing our hands, wearing our masks, keeping our distance.

'I believe in realism and not saying everything is going to be okay,' she concluded.

Speaking of Cyrus' love for realism, the Hannah Montana alum recently performed her track Midnight Sky, which explores the relationship she endured after her divorce from Liam Hemsworth, on Jimmy Kimmel last week. 

She also performed a soulful rendition of Hall & Oates' hit 1982 track, Maneater, after ending her nearly year-long romance with Cody Simpson in August.

During her virtual appearance, the self-proclaimed 'freshly single' Cyrus spoke about the song choice.

When the 45-year-old late-night host asked what prompted her cover, Miley explained she felt it was 'very important to be transparent.'

'I'm freshly single, so anyone watching that's my future ex-husband, just know, I told you,' she joked, after singing about being a seductive woman who uses men.

After 14 years in the public eye, she teased about not having any 'skeletons' in her closet and that her performance was a warning to her next partner.

Cyrus recently split from Simpson, whom she began dating after the end of her marriage to Liam Hemsworth and a short-lived romance with Kaitlynn Carter.
