Olivia Culpo turned her bathtub into her office Tuesday to deal with painful cramps.

The 28-year-old beauty queen shared her new work setup in a short video on her Instagram Stories.

'We're here in my new office space,' Olivia told her roughly 4.7 million followers on the social media platform.

The Rhode Island native had a black facial mask treatment on and wore a black swimsuit in the tub.

'Cramps are so bad today I made the bath tub my office,' Olivia wrote as a caption.

Olivia revealed last month on her Instagram Stories that she suffers from endometriosis.

'It was something that I was nervous to share because I really didn't know if people would be familiar with the condition, and it turns out a lot of women are,' Olivia told People last week in an article.

'I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods. They're not normal, and they could get in the way of your fertility,' she added.

The Miss USA 2012 and Miss Universe 2012 winner was diagnosed last year with endometriosis, in which tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside the uterus.

She noted that endometriosis can be 'very difficult' to diagnose and advised women to get their egg count checked and to make sure their painful periods aren't affecting either their ovaries or eggs.

'Down the line, it's so heartbreaking when you think about someone who maybe could have taken action earlier, and now they can't have children. That to me just feels awful,' she said.

The Reprisal star revealed that she wasn't considering laparoscopic surgery to treat her endometriosis.

'I'm trying to do the holistic route as of now,' Culpo said.

She added: 'I want to try to see if I can figure some things out for myself, but we'll see. It's a journey. Every month is different because I try different things every month. But I'll definitely keep everybody posted on what works for me, and eventually having to get the surgery because it really depends. Everyone's different.'

Olivia has been dating pro football player Christian McCaffrey, 24, for about a year.
