Helen Flanagan stopped using Photoshop on her pictures to show her daughters it's 'prettier to be natural.'

The Coronation Street actress, 30, told MailOnline she used to alter images of herself before uploading them to social media and would even make her bottom bigger to be more like Kim Kardashian.

But the former I'm A Celeb star has taken a stand in deleting photo-enhancing apps to prove to daughters Matilda, five, and Delilah, two, that 'Instagram perfection' does not exist. 

Gorgeous: Helen Flanagan stopped using Photoshop on her pictures to show her daughters it's 'prettier to be natural,' as she poses in a pre-pregnancy photo shoot for Pour Moi 

Helen, who announced last week she's expecting her third baby with fiancé Scott Sinclair, 31, stars in a pre-pregnancy photo shoot for Pour Moi, where she showcases her figure in a range of sexy lingerie. 

In an exclusive interview, the model, who launches her first collaboration with the brand, said: 'Before lockdown if I was in a tight dress I would make my bum look bigger and I thought "why am I doing this? Who am I doing this for?"

'It's not really a good example to my daughters and they look up to me. It's quite nice to be natural. I do enjoy social media but I like to keep it genuine and honest.

'I don't want my daughters to use social media and see constantly edited pictures and Instagram perfection – it isn't good for young girls.

'I like to keep it genuine and honest': The Coronation Street actress has taken a stand to prove to daughters Matilda, five, and Delilah, two, that 'Instagram perfection' does not exist 

'I accept myself': The former I'm A Celeb star said she's learned to embrace her 'cellulite' and no longer wants to imitate Kim Kardashian's curves, in favour of loving her own physique

Celebration: The couple are yet to discover the sex of their unborn baby but have told daughters Matilda and Delilah whatever they have will be perfect for the family 

'I know my angles; I know how to get good angles in pictures, which is fun. But I really don't like the idea of my children having Instagram at all.'   

Helen, who's regularly posed in lingerie throughout her career, said she feels a lot more confident in herself after turning 30 this year. 

The TV actress told MailOnline she 'embraces' her cellulite and has learned to stop imitating Kim Kardashian's curves, in favour of loving her own physique. 

She said: 'In my early 20s I wasn't as confident as I am now. Now I'm 30 I've learned to really love myself more and embrace myself. I accept myself for who I am. 

'It's a good thing to have': Helen said she made the realisation after turning 30 this year – after stripping off for a glamorous lingerie shoot 

Confidence: Helen took part in the shoot before falling pregnant with her third baby with husband-to-be Scott Sinclair, who she's been with for 11 years  

'I have cellulite on my legs and it doesn't bother me. I am slim but I don't have a Kim Kardashian bum. You just have to accept yourself for who you are. 

'It's also really attractive to be confident. When you're confident and grow to love yourself – that's a good thing to have, specially when you're modelling.

'I love the brand so it was really great to do an autumn winter edit with them. It's beautiful lingerie.

'There are some really lovely sexy pieces and some really comfy loungewear and PJs, dressing gown and slippers; there is something for everyone.'

On hold: Helen and Scott had planned to tie the knot this year but have been forced to put their wedding on hold as a result of the coronavirus pandemic 

Helen announced last week she's expecting her third baby with fiancé and Preston North End footballer Scott, who she's been with for 11 years.

They had planned to tie the knot this year after getting engaged in 2018 but have been forced to put their wedding on hold due to coronavirus. 

The couple are yet to discover the sex of their unborn baby but have told daughters Matilda and Delilah whatever they have will be perfect for the family.

Helen said: 'I've always wanted to be a mum, I've always been maternal and I've always been broody, ever since I was younger. 

Growing brood: Helen said she always wanted a big family from a young age and she's happy to have met partner Scott aged 19 

'Obviously I have a lovely fiancé – gosh Scott and I have been together for 11 years. We have been together since we were 19. We met when we were younger so I suppose we started having children younger.

'I don't know if I'll have anymore, we will have to see how we get on with baby No3.

'I don't know what I'm having yet. I am undecided if I'm going to find out. I just said to the girls whatever we have will be perfect for our family.'    

Helen said one advantage of being pregnant is that her skin, which she describes as 'acne prone,' clears up, and she's able to enjoy a flawless complexion. 

All natural: Helen said she used to alter images of herself before uploading them to social media but now she refuses to use photo enhancing apps 

She said: 'I've always struggled with my skin on and off since I was about 16. 

'To be honest with you, what I really do enjoy during pregnancy is that my skin is really clear. 

'My skin is really lovely when I'm pregnant or when I'm nursing, otherwise I really struggle. 

'I go to a dermatologist and try different medications for acne but it's so hormonal my skin. It's a nice perk that it's clear during pregnancy.' 

The Helen Flanagan Edit for Pour Moi is available from October 1 exclusively on Pour Moi's website

Throwback: The star admitted she used to edit her pictures and would even make her bum look bigger to be more like Kim Kardashian (Helen on Instagram before giving up Photoshop)
