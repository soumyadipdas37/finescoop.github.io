The TOWIE star finished her ensemble with a pair of grey trainers and a water bottle.

Adding a touch of glamour, the star opted for a white Chanel handbag and silvery jewellery.

Olivia styled her peroxide blonde locks into two plaits and added a slick of minimal make-up.

Meanwhile Bradley also cut a casual figure in black gym leggings, shorts and T-shirt for the workout.

He finished his look with a hoodie wrapped around his waist and grey trainers.

Despite heading for an intense workout, Olivia and Bradley appeared in great spirits as they shared a giggle. 

The former grid girl recently announced her new reality TV show, called Meets Her Match, which will air on ITVBe this autumn.

The eight-episode series will follow Olivia and her Blackburn Rovers footballer fiancé Bradley, as they plan their wedding and buy their first home in Cheshire.

The couple got engaged in Dubai last year and the programme will document their relationship as they prepare to take it the next level, with the Love Island star planning her dream wedding.

Olivia previously had her own reality show with ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes called Crackin' On.

However, their relationship took a turn for the worse when Chris, 27, broke up with her on camera, telling her the relationship wasn't making him happy anymore.

He said to her at the time: 'I love you, I always will. You know that, nothing doubts that. You can't kid yourself.'

Olivia then reunited with Bradley, whom she was with before Love Island, while Chris found love with his now ex-girlfriend Jesy Nelson.
