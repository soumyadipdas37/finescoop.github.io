Matthew Koma laid on a healthy dose of 'sweet nothings' on his wife Hilary Duff for her 33rd birthday, for all the world to see.

The singer-songwriter took to Instagram and shared a sweet message of love, in the form of polaroid photo, that was followed up by a look at the gag gift he gave her that's suitable for their bathroom.

It's this one's birthday today and, as usual, I struggle to find words that celebrate all she is,' the Winnetka Bowling League frontman began in the caption of a polaroid picture showing Duff standing next to a canopied bed.

Sweet nothings: Matthew Koma shared a romantic message of love to wife Hilary Duff for her 33rd birthday on Monday, September 28

Koma would find the perfect set of words to shower his wife with during these uncertain times in this post-COVID-19 world.

'In a global pandemic, during our first year of marriage, in a world that's becoming a heavier and more confusing place to navigate with kids in tow, there's nobody who does it better,' he added.

He ended the post with: 'I love you something beyond and I can't wait to foam all over you today. @itsfoamtime' 

Birthday message: 'I love you something beyond,' Koma wrote, in part, along with a polaroid photo of Duff standing next to a canopied bed

Koma, 33, also shared a black-and-white photo of the couple standing in front of Duff's two-tier birthday cake with her eight-year-old son Luca.

Flashing a glowing smile on her face, the Lizzie McGuire star has her arms wrapped around Luca as he appears to be sticking his fingers into the cake to get a taste of the icing.

Duff is dressed in an all-black ensemble with her blonde tresses pulled back into a bun, with the exception of a few strands of hair, and a 'happy birthday' headband along the top of her head.

Her husband can be seen leaning in on his ladylove in black pants, a plaid shirt over a black tee, and a light-colored beanie cap.

Koma also showed off his sense of humor by sharing a quick video of his gag-gift  -- a roll of unique toilet paper -- that they both shared on their Instagram Stories.

It read: 'Happy birthday... I love [red heart] the sh** [pile of poop} outta you,' on each sheet of toilet paper.   

The birthday girl headlined the post: 'Hubby was really proud of this gift .'

Duff and Koma had been friends and songwriting colleagues for a few years before they started a romantic relationship in January 2017.

They eventually were married during a small and intimate backyard ceremony in Los Angeles on December 21, 2019. 

The couple are the proud parents to daughter Banks, who turns two-years-old in October.
