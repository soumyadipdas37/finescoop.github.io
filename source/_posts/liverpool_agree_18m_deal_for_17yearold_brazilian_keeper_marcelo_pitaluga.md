Liverpool 'have agreed a £1.8million deal for Brazilian goalkeeper Marcelo Pitaluga' as the Premier League champions make their second signing of the summer.

The Anfield club's scouts have reportedly been monitoring the 17-year-old Fluminense stopper for several months and have made a breakthrough in negotiations.

Brazilian news outlet Globo Esporte say Liverpool had their original offer rejected but returned with a second bid of £930,000 for Pitaluga plus a further £930,000 if he achieves various performance-related add-ons.

Fluminense were reluctant to sell Pitaluga but Liverpool's offer has apparently too good to refuse.

Globo Esporte say Pitaluga will sign a three-year contract with the option for a further two years.

The deal was pushed through more easily than usual with South American imports because the Brazilian holds a German passport. This means the 17-year-old doesn't have to wait until his next birthday to move to Europe.

The financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was another factor in the Brazilian club's need to sell the youngster after president Mario Bittencourt spoke about the need to raise funds through player sales.

Pitaluga was also fourth in the club's goalkeeper pecking order though Liverpool will obviously see him as one for the future.

He posted an Instagram snap alongside Reds keeper Alisson Becker back in February and has previously visited England with Brazil's youth sides.

Liverpool have been quiet in the transfer market ahead of the new season, with the Greek international defender Kostas Tsimikas coming in for £12million. 

They begin their Premier League title defence against Leeds United on Saturday.
