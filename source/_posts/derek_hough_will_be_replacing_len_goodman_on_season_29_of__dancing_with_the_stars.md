Derek Hough is replacing Len Goodman on Dancing With The Stars for season 29.

The 35-year-old TV star will step in for the show's debut in late September as Len is poised to remain in the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic.

'This show has been and will always be incredibly special to me,' said Hough. 'Coming back feels like coming home and I couldn't be more excited to be back in the ballroom.' His sister Julianne Hough has served as a judge in the past as well.

A break: The 35-year-old TV star is set to replace Len - who is poised to remain in the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic - as a judge during the upcoming season of the show

Len, 76, will still be a part of the show, but he'll be sharing his dancing expertise remotely.

The new season of the long-running program will also see Tyra Banks replace Tom Bergeron as the host.

And the 46-year-old beauty recently teased what fans should expect from the upcoming series.

Looking forward to her new role, she said: 'I think it's important to continue to make sure that younger people are watching the show with their older family members, that co-viewing, of bringing everybody together.'

His other show: Derek has been on World Of Dance with Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo

Tyra is also keen to bring some of her own ideas to fruition during the new series.

However, the model has insisted she won't be taking a 'sledgehammer' to the 'Dancing with the Stars' format.

Speaking about her own ambitions for the show, Tyra explained: 'I have some ideas on having a little popular dance mixed [in], we have some ideas, we'll be testing that and seeing how people are feeling that.

'And there's some other things I'm not supposed to share, but, trying to turn it up a notch!

'But not too much, because the show is a hit. I'm not coming here with a sledgehammer ... that'd be dumb. So just adding some sprinkle pixie dust to it.' 

Hough, 35, a professional dancer and older brother of Julianne Hough, who won the MirrorBall trophy a record six times, was a dancer on the show from 2007 to 2016.

He has since been keeping busy as a judge on NBC's World of Dance alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo. 

Derek's return: Four years after leaving ABC's hit reality series Dancing With the Stars, Derek Hough is slated to return

Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tomoli and Len have served as the longtime judges on the show.

ABC made the surprising announcement in July that longtime host Tom Bergeron, who has hosted all 28 seasons of the show, is leaving, along with longtime co-host Erin Andrews.

They are being replaced by Tyra Banks, who is hosting the show solo and was said to spearhead the 'creative refresh' of the show as host and executive producer. 

Just hours before Hough's return was teased, the celebrity cast of Dancing With the Stars Season 29 was announced.
