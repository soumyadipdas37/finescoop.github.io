Andrea returned to Loose Women in May 2020 and publicly disclosed that she had gone through a really challenging time.

'If [the coronavirus pandemic] had happened then it would've been horrendous but I worked on myself so hard and had so much help and so much support that when it happened we'd already started calming our life down, taking things out that were causing stress.'

Andrea has spent most of her lockdown writing for her new book, which divulges the most 'raw' and 'honest' moments during her breakdown and leading up to it. 

The TV presenter revealed on Loose Women that the book discloses her previous experience with domestic abuse and her mental struggles as she finally reached her breaking point.

She said: 'Last year i had a breakdown, I also spent much of the following year and much of the lockdown writing about that breakdown. 

'What that's like, it's like poking a wound. The book that I've written is the most honest and raw book i have ever written.

'[It incorporates] the reasons why [I had a breakdown]... It talks about domestic abuse, which I have never opened up about before, it talks about mental unwellness, and getting to that breaking point when you can't take anymore.'

Luckily, the mother-of-two has the support of her family and friends as she comes to terms with her breakdown.

She said: 'It talks about domestic abuse, which I have never opened up about before, it talks about mental unwellness, and getting to that breaking point when you can't take anymore'

However, the emotional toll of reliving some of the hardest moments of her life in made Andrea feel like she needed some time away.
