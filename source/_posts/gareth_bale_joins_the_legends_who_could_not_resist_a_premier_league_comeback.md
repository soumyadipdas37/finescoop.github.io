Once you have had a taste of the Premier League it is very hard to resist the temptation of a return to England's top flight, no matter how late in your career it is.

Branislav Ivanovic has proven that this week by completing a move to West Bromwich Albion after three years with Zenit St Petersburg, having previously spent a decade cleaning up honours at Chelsea.

But he isn't the only Premier League great who has also decided this week to have another crack in England. The other needs little introduction - Gareth Bale is back at Tottenham.

Sportsmail looks at the other legends who, after at least a couple of years away from England, could not resist the urge of one final flourish here at the end of their careers.

Such was Jurgen Klinsmann's impact upon joining Tottenham Hotspur ahead of the 1994-95 season that by the time he had left less than a year later he had already gone down as a legend for his club and in the Premier League.

In truth he had probably done that in his first game. Playing up to his moniker of perhaps going to ground a little too easily he celebrated scoring on his debut against Sheffield Wednesday by performing a now iconic dive alongside Spurs team-mates.

Jurgen Klinsmann became an almost instant hero after arriving at Tottenham in 1994

The Germany striker averaged over a goal every other game by netting 29 times in 50 matches but left for the temptation of Bayern Munich at the end of the season.

Three years down the line and the 33-year-old was back in north London for what turned out to be the last six months of his career on loan from Sampdoria.

Spurs were in relegation turmoil but his record of nine goals in 15 games played a major role in keeping them up. He scored four at Wimbledon in a 6-2 win to mathematically ensure Spurs' Premier League status on the penultimate matchday of the season to cement his legendary status at White Hart Lane. He retired straight after the 1998 World Cup.

Evra only cost United £5.5million when they signed him from Monaco back in January 2006, when Sir Alex Ferguson started putting together one of his finest United teams following a transitional few years at Old Trafford.

The France international had a slow start to life in England, with Ferguson even preferring to play Mikael Silvestre during the early stages of his first full season in 2006-07.

He soon forced his way into the side though to end the year in the Premier League team of the year, something he would replicate in 2009 and 2010, with his time at Old Trafford seeing him win the title five times and establishing himself as one of the best left-backs in the world.

After Ferguson left and a disastrous campaign under David Moyes, Evra moved to Juventus before spending a few months at Marseille where his contract was terminated after he controversially kicked a fan prior to a match.

Enter West Ham, who in February 2018 took a punt on a 36-year-old to try and bomb up and down the flank with perhaps predictable consequences. In five games he started, three times they resulted in 4-1 defeats by Liverpool, Swansea City and Manchester City. 

He was a substitute to help the Hammers claim a point at Chelsea and was finally on the winning side in his last professional game that May when he came off the bench with a minute to play in the 2-0 win at Leicester City.

Arrived at Arsenal as a winger who Juventus could not wait to get rid of in 1999 and left eight years later as one of the greatest strikers to ever star in the Premier League.

It soon became clear why Juventus didn't want him when the £10.5m France international scored only two goals in his first 17 games for the club despite now playing up front.

Then the goal avalanche came, 174 Premier League goals were rattled in with flair and class across 254 games, which for much of the time made him a defender's nightmare. As well as four golden boots, he won the Premier League twice - being a major star of the Invincibles side of 2003-04.

Following a spell at Barcelona, he was winding down his career in New York when Arsenal came calling again in January 2012 for a two-month loan.

By this point there was already a statue of him outside the Emirates Stadium, and while fans knew they were not getting the player back at his best, they were desperate just to catch a glimpse of his talent again. 

He would only feature four times in the Premier League but the 34-year-old saved his best moment until the end, coming off the bench to score a last-gasp winner at Sunderland in his final league appearance for the club.

Peter Schmeichel was a crucial part of Manchester United's rise to dominance in the 1990s and transformed the role of the goalkeeper during the decade.

For much of his time at Old Trafford he was frighteningly consistent to the point there was never any concern over having to upgrade the great Dane during his eight years at the club following his 1991 arrival.

His imposing figure between the United sticks saw him land five titles as well as the Premier League player of the season for 1995-96. After winning the treble with United he left for Sporting Lisbon in 1999 where many expected he would wind down his career.

Yet by 2001 he had secured a shock Premier League return with Aston Villa while approaching 38 years old. He was past his best but the old dog could still learn new tricks after becoming the first goalkeeper to score in the Premier League with a well struck volley at Everton - which even Toffees fans applauded.

Villa did not take up their option to extend his deal by a further year but another shock soon followed as he joined Manchester United's rivals Manchester City for his final year in the game, making 29 appearances... but not scoring.

Arrived at Arsenal as a £3m capture from AC Milan in 1996, yet so little was known of the midfielder few would have been able to confidently predict he would go on to become one of the Premier League's best ever midfielders.

Admitting he only joined the Gunners because he knew Arsene Wenger was set to manage the club, he wasted little time in becoming an enforcer in the midfield under his compatriot.

He was essential to the team which would go on to win the Premier League three times during his nine years at the club, with his ability to cover offensive and defensive areas of the midfield with an imposing physical stature only matched by his arch-nemesis: Roy Keane at Manchester United.

After leaving Highbury to spend five years in Italy with Juventus and Inter Milan, he returned for one last crack at the Premier League with Manchester City in January 2010 by signing a six-month deal at the age of 33.

Naturally his box-to-box days as a midfielder were done, but he impressed enough under Roberto Mancini to earn a one-year contract extension. Following 28 steady Premier League appearances and three goals in 18 months, he retired after winning the FA Cup.

Ivanovic is not the first former Chelsea player to be unable to resist the lure of a return to the Premier League.

His former Blues team-mate Didier Drogba had more to lose than to gain by returning to Stamford Bridge in 2014 though, having ended his first spell in west London by netting the winning penalty to win the Champions League in 2012.

It was the fitting finale he would have dreamed of, having already become a Premier League and Chelsea legend following his high-profile £24m move from Marseille eight years prior and going on to net 100 Premier League goals on the way to three league titles.

A year in China and a season at Galatasaray followed but eyebrows were raised when he ended up at Chelsea again at the age of 36 on a free transfer.

By now he was considered back-up to the likes of Diego Costa but he still managed to make 28 Premier League appearances, and although he only scored four times - and just once in his final five months - he left the club again with a winners' medal in the form of a fourth Premier League title.

A classic example of how an early Wenger could sell a star and then almost effortlessly replace them at Arsenal with a like-for-like upgrade.

Arsenal supporters had every right to be concerned when they sold popular winger Marc Overmars to Barcelona but that he soon became a forgotten man following the arrival of Robert Pires in 2000 was a measure of the Frenchman's impact.

Throughout the next six years he became integral to Arsenal's attack. He was vital in linking the midfield to the forwards but was also lethal in front of goal - always netting double figures across all competitions before his 2006 departure.

At 33 years old he had already started to drift out of the first-team picture at Arsenal and he would spend the next four years seemingly playing out his professional career at Villarreal before he was released in the summer of 2010

His professional career, at least at the top, looked over. Yet, Aston Villa offered him a shock return to the Premier League aged 37 that November with a six-month deal.

Although he showed glimpses of the talent that made him a star at Arsenal, he struggled to have much influences in games and was released at the end of the season having failed to score in nine appearances.
