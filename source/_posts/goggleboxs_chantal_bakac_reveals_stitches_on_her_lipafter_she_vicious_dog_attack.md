Ouch! Gogglebox Australia star Chantal Bakac has been left terrorised after being attacked by a vicious dog. The blonde required several stitches on her lower lip following the scary incident

Early on in the episode, Chantal was gifted by a bouquet of flowers by Kaday who joked: 'I got you flowers for being stupid. This is your flowers, for putting your face in a dog's face.' 

The Sydney-based friends later watched an episode of Channel 10's new comedy Drunk History, which proved to be challenging for the injured star when she laughed.

At one point, Chantal couldn't contain her laughter as the inebriated comedian, Anne Edmonds, narrated Dame Nellie Melba's life story.

Kaday, who is also a nurse, urged her friend to close her mouth so she wouldn't further injure herself and damage the stitches in her lip.

On another night, the ladies got together to eat dinner and watch The Bachelor.

Chantal used her fingers to eat a bowl of spaghetti and a straw to drink up the sauce, explaining: 'I can't eat on this side of my mouth. I'm actually serious.'

She then told her pal: 'If there was a Cocker Spaniel at the other end, it would be like Lady and the Tramp.'
