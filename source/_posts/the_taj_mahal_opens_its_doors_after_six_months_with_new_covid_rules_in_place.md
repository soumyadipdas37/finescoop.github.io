India has reopened the Taj Mahal after six months with new Covid-19 restriciton sin place and its capacity reduced from 70,000 to just 5,000 visitors a day 

The first visitors trickled into the famous monument on Monday even as India looks set to overtake the US as the global leader in coronavirus infections, with authorities reporting 86,961 new coronavirus infections across the country and no signs of a peak yet. 

The white marble tomb in the city of Agra, built by a 17th-century Mughal emperor for his wife, was opened to the public at sunrise, and a Chinese national and a visitor from Delhi were among the first to enter.

Tourists have their pictures taken at the Taj Mahal in Agra on September 21. The Taj Mahal reopened to visitors today in a symbolic business-as-usual gesture,

Daily visitor numbers have been capped at 5,000, versus an average of 20,000 before the pandemic. Tickets are only being sold online, with fewer than 300 bought on the first day.

Visitors will have their temperatures taken and must adhere to advice to keep a safe distance from each other.

Special rules have been introduced, including no touching the white marble walls of the mausoleum built for a Mughal emperor's favourite wife. 

Visitors can whip off their masks for a photo, but security personnel are quick to remind them to put them back on once the shutter has been pressed.

People are permitted to take selfies or solo photographs, but group photos are banned. 

And the famous bench where people usually sit to have their picture taken has been laminated in plastic, to help cleaning between every photo op.

'We have all the safety measures in place,' said Vasant Swarnkar from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which oversees the UNESCO world heritage site in Agra south of New Delhi.

'We want to send out the message that things are not so bad and you will be safe if you follow the instructions.'

Aditya Diksha, one of the early visitors at the Taj, said he and his friends drove 12 hours from central India and stopped in Agra on their way to the mountains in the north.

'It is the first time in six months we have been out, so it feels good,' he said.

Workers at the Taj were sanitising the handrails while paramilitary police shouted at tourists not to touch any of the surfaces.

'We are following all COVID-19 protocols,' said Swarnkar.

India's coronavirus tally of 5.49 million infections is second only to the United States with 6.79 million, a figure the South Asian nation could overtake in the next few weeks at its current rate of increase.

The death toll of 87,882 was up 1,130 from the previous day, health ministry figures showed.

But as a proportion of its population, India's toll is still small compared to countries such as the United States, Brazil and Britain. 

Faced with the deepest economic contraction in decades, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing to free up virus curbs so that jobs and businesses can resume.

'We can survive for another four to six months: after that we will have to take some serious calls,' said Abid Naqvi, who saw bookings at his boutique hotel in Agra drop to zero overnight after India's abrupt lockdown in March.

Until then, the 13-room Ekaa Villa, which opened last year at a cost of almost $1 million, had been operating at close to capacity.

Tourists visit the Taj Mahal in Agra on September 21. Tourism contributed about $240 billion, or 9.2% of India's gross domestic product in 2018

Tourism contributed about $240 billion, or 9.2% of India's gross domestic product in 2018, employing more than 42 million people, World Travel and Tourism Council data show.

However, foreign tourists were unlikely to return until at least April, said Manu PV, secretary of the Association of Tourism Trade Organisations India, a month that traditionally signals the end of the tourist season.

And a confusing system of regional lockdowns and quarantine rules is deterring domestic tourists.

'People don't want to go on holiday,' Manu said. 'They are very worried. There is the fear factor.'
