Police officers are seen learning how to navigate firebombs and respond to violent rioters in tonight's episode of BBC1's Our Cops In The North.  

Northumbria Police, which recruits some 200 new officers every year, allowed cameras to film officers undergoing training in highly stressful circumstances for the documentary. 

Scenes show officers undergoing tactical training, in which they use shields to protect themselves from objects being thrown from above, and navigating a wall of flames after a trainer throws firebombs at their feet.

The episode also shows PC Rosie Burbridg, a recently-qualified police response officer, completing taser training. 

PC Burbrig is seen learning how to use the taser in a classroom training before putting her knowledge into action in a simulation. 

The 21-year-old also tells how she trained to become an accountant after leaving school before following her parents to the police. 

Cameras follow PC Burbrig as she sees first-hand the reality of responding to 999 calls on the street, including the rising number of mental health related calls.

Qualified for just a month, she deals with a caller with severe mental health issues and the shaken victim of a drive-by shooting.

Elsewhere long-serving detective Julie Milne, who has worked for Northumbria Police for 23 years, investigates a challenging case as part of the Complex Cases Unit. 

As Julie arrests a suspect in a historic case of child trafficking, she works with the specialist marines search team to identify evidence that corroborates the harrowing testimony of the victims.

Meanwhile, reports have come in of a man seen with a gun at a college, and it is tactical commander Andy Huddleston’s job to arrest the suspect and recover the firearm. 

Andy orders the Firearm Support Unit to carry out a dawn raid to minimise the risk to the public.

Our Cops In The North airs tonight at 9pm on BBC1.
