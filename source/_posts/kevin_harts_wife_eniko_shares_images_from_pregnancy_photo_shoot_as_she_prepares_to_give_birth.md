She's due to give birth very soon to her second child with comedian and actor Kevin Hart.

And on Thursday, Eniko Hart shared a string of images from a pregnancy photo shoot that put her swollen belly front and center.

The 36-year-old posed in a series of revealing outfits for the pictures that she posted to her Instagram Story.

Candid: She's due to give birth very soon to her second child and on Thursday, Eniko Hart shared images from a pregnancy photo shoot that put her swollen belly front and center

For one set of photos, Eniko daringly posed wearing just a white blazer as she sat on a wooden stool.

The blazer was unfastened, falling open to reveal some of her bare breasts and all of her bare stomach.

Her long hair was loose and sleekly styled to fall down over one shoulder and she was made up with dusky eye-shadow and lip gloss.

She completed her look with fine gold necklaces and bracelets.

It's a girl: Eniko tied the knot with Hart in 2016 and the couple welcomed their son Kenzo in November 2017. This time around, they are expecting a daughter 

In a different set of pictures, Eniko is wearing a black sheer bodysuit with split skirt.

She cradles her baby bump with one perfectly manicured hand while placing her other hand across her breasts.

She changed it up again by donning a white cropped peasant-style top with drop shoulders and a white skirt with side splits. 

This time, she poses with one leg forward to maximize the amount of skin she flashes and with her hands on the small of her back, she pushes out her tummy.
