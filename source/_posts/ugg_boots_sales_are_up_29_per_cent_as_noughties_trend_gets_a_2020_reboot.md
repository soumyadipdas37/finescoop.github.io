The cosy sheepskin Ugg boot that was the the height of fashion in the early noughties has made a comeback  as stunning supermodels across the globe have been pictured sporting pairs as part of their post-lockdown looks.

Emily Ratajkowski and Joan Smalls have recently been spotted in the £145 Ugg Australia minis, while Sienna Miller, Gigi Hadid, Sarah Jessica Parker and Rihanna are also long term fans of the boots.   

The comfy cropped boot - which was originally designed to keep surfers feet warm in the 1970s - is a variation on the classic model, with a twist to keep up with 2020 street style.

Gigi Hadid is also a fan of the boots and has been spotted sporting them while out and about. She is pictured in New York last year

The shoe was once synonymous with WAGs and reality TV stars, with many pairing them with velour tracksuits for a casual look.

Now, more than a decade later, as coronavirus measures ease fashion icons across the world are once again opting for a cosy look, with Vogue branding Uggs 'the supermodel shoe of lockdown'. 

Lyst, the largest global fashion search platform in the world, recently reported UGGs are making a comeback as there's been a huge search in people looking to buy the boot.

'Ugly boots are replacing ugly sandals post-summer, demand for UGG boots is growing 24 per cent week-on-week. Over the past month, there have been more than 41,000 searches for the brand,' the report read.

Binky Felstead (pictured  left in London) is often sported in a pair of UGG minis. Brie Larson (right in LA)  is also regularly seen in UGGs while out and about

Fashion icon Rihanna is also often seen in the comfy shoes, she is pictured here in 2016 donning the boots

John Lewis have also revealed sales are up 29 per cent compared with last year.  

This week, It-bag designer Telfar Clemens wore a pair of the ultra mini boots to announce that his label would collaborate with Ugg for a 2021 collection.  

The designer released a  teaser showing the collaboration's logo where the middle 'G' in 'UGG' becomes his famous 'TC' insignia. 

'I've always been obsessed with a certain kind of ubiquity when something really unique ends up on everybody. 

'What I want to do is get down to the DNA of UGG and see what genes we have in common. To get down to the core of that feeling.'
