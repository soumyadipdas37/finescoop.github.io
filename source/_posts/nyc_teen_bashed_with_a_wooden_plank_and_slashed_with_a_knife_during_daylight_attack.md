A surveillance camera has captured the horrifying moment a teenager was slashed with a knife and beaten with a wooden plank by two men in New York City. 

The attack occurred Wednesday afternoon as the 19-year-old victim exited a deli across from the popular Bronx Zoo. 

Vision shows the two suspects laying in wait before they pounced on the teen as he held the deli's door open for another customer. 

One of the assailants, who was clad in a black t-shirt and baseball cap, pulled out a knife and slashed the victim across the neck.

The second attacker, who was dressed in a white tee and red sweatpants, repeatedly beat the teen with a wooden plank before he fell to the ground. 

The suspect then swiped the youngster's cellphone before fleeing in a blue Honda Civic. 

The two attackers are still at large, and authorities are pleading with the public for help in identifying the duo. 

The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he remains in a critical condition, according to Pix 11.

The brazen broad daylight attack comes amid a shocking surge in violent crime across New York City. 

The NYPD reported a 166 percent increase in shootings across the month of August when compared with the same time last year. 

Murder rates were also up 47 percent, while burglaries were up 22 percent. 

The shocking stats come after Mayor Bill de Blasio defunded the NYPD by more than $1 billion back in July following widespread protests.
