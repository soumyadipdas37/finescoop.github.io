One of the most spectacular residences in Sydney has been snapped up by a mystery buyer for $95million, set to be a record for the second most expensive house sold in Australia. 

The spectacular five-storey Point Piper property called 'Edgewater' features a private jetty, tennis court, and huge terraces on each level overlooking Sydney Harbour.  

While details on the purchaser have not been released, a deal was quietly reached earlier in September after lengthy negotiations, according to Domain. 

The spectacular five-storey Point Piper property (pictured) called 'Edgewater' features a private jetty, tennis court, and huge terraces on each level overlooking Sydney Harbour 

The house sits on an 1,800sq m block with a 40m water frontage - that includes the only harbour-front tennis court in Sydney (pictured: the view from the house) 

The deal was reportedly brokered by the managing director of Sotheby's Sydney with terms expected to be finalised in 2022. 

When finalised the deal will is set to be the second highest residential sale in the country - only topped by the sale of nearby residence 'Fairwater' in 2018. 

That property was bought by tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes for $100million with the software mogul also buying the neighbouring house for $12million in 2019. 

Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have also reportedly  recently purchased the former mansion of Jennifer Hawkins and Jake Wall, continuing their property splurge.

Billionaire software tycoon Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie (pictured) purchased nearby 'Fairwater' for $100million and also reportedly the former mansion of Jennifer Hawkins and Jake Wall for a record $24.5million in the Northern Beaches

That sale of that house, called Casa Paloma, in Newport was a record for the Northern Beaches at $24.5million. 

Edgewater was built in the 1980s by Michael Edgely, a show-businesses entrepreneur who among other credits produced the Australian film 'The Man from Snowy River'. 

The house was then sold to the founders of the Katies retail fashion stores who made their fortune after selling the stores to the Coles Myer Group. 

The house sits on an 1,800sq m block with a 40m water frontage - that includes the only harbour-front tennis court in Sydney. 

Each of the levels also features floor-to-ceiling glass walls looking out over Sydney Harbour and the house can be used as two self-contained dwellings, each with their own kitchens and bathrooms.
