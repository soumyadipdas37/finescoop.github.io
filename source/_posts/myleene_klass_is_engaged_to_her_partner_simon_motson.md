Myleene Klass has revealed she has got engaged to her boyfriend Simon Motson. 

The media personality, 42, admitted she was shocked when her partner popped the question last month on the fifth anniversary of their first date.

Speaking to Hello! magazine, Myleene told how Simon got down on one knee in the couple's garden shed, which he recreated into a replica of the place they had their first date.

She said: 'We're engaged! I was absolutely blown away. He even replicated the dinner we had – burger and fries, followed by cherry pie.

'When he got down on one knee and started fumbling around under the table, I thought he was joking. Then I thought: "Oh my God, he's for real." I was completely speechless.

Simon added: It's quite a blur but I think I said something along the lines of: 'Myleene Angela Klass, will you marry me?' And I had to say it again... and I think I said it a third time. Finally she said yes and we were both in tears. 

The couple's engagement has delighted Myleene's daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, who have been determined to see the couple walk down the aisle.
