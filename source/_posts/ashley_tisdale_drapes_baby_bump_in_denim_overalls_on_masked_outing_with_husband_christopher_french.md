Ashley Tisdale draped her baby bump in a pair of denim overalls as she emerged from lockdown in Los Angeles this Friday.

The 35-year-old is expecting her firstborn child with her musician husband Christopher French who was also with her on her outing.

Sweeping her signature blonde hair into a stylishly messy updo, she accessorized her look with a chic pair of round green shades.

The High School Musical star made sure to take the precaution of wearing both a mask and gloves as she stepped out amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

She teamed her overalls with a simple Breton stripe T-shirt and rounded off her California casual ensemble with sandals.

Ashley and her dashing husband were joined by a male pal when they were spotted out and about in Los Angeles ahead of the weekend.

That day she swung by her Insta Stories to upload a couple of selfies of her overall ensemble, which included a bandanna round her neck.

Posing for a mirror selfie at home before heading out, the New Jersey native gushed: 'I've never love overalls so much.' 

Her outing came one day after she revealed on her Instagram page that she and Christopher are about to become parents.

Ashley and Christopher posed for a couple of pictures in which they posed up romantically together in the backyard.

She cradled her baby bump to throw it into relief under her flowing white dress, which he matched with a white button-down shirt.

Among the flood of Instagram comments wishing her well was one from Vanessa Hudgens saying: 'Just the freaking cutest.'

Although Vanessa played Ashley's love rival in the High School Musical movies the dynamic duo are close friends in real life.

In fact last year they both served as bridesmaids for their actress pal Kimberly Hidalgo whens he married Pretty Little Liars heartthrob Brant Daugherty.

Kim and Vanessa were also both bridesmaids for Ashley when she married Christopher in a secret ceremony in 2014.

Ashley wrote a new blog post on the website for her skincare brand Frenshe and discussed why she chose this moment to have a baby.

In a passage she included on Insta Stories she wrote: 'I’m glad I worked on myself before we decided to make this decision. After six years of marriage, you build a strong foundation, and as weird as the timing is right now, it just felt like right.'
