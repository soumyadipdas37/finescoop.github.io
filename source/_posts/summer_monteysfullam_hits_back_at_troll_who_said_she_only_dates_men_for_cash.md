Summer Monteys-Fullam has insisted 'money only impresses lazy girls' as she hit back at a troll who said she only dates men for cash.

The stunning redhead, 25, who is the ex girlfriend of Paul Hollywood, 54, said she works hard for her money and has never lived off anyone else.

Summer responded to a troll who left her a message saying: 'Still living off his name then yeah? Anything to get into the papers', after the beauty claiming her ex Paul has sent her over 25 legal letters.

Summer fired back by sharing a message that read: 'Money only impresses lazy girls. When a woman works hard, a man with money is a bonus, not a ladder to an upgrade.'

The former barmaid also shared an animated post which showed identical images of a woman taking cash out of an ATM.

Responding directly to the troll, who Summer said has been leaving her messages for a year, she wrote: 'Have you not learnt by STALKING my page non stop for the past year that I will call anyone out and post it on my stories. BE WARNED AND P**S OFF'.

It comes after Summer hit out at her ex Paul as she claimed he has sent her over 25 legal letters since their split.

Summer was answering fan questions on her Instagram when she admitted a 'nameless ex' had sent her several letters.   

A user asked: 'How many legal letters has a certain nameless ex sent you?' to which Summer replied: 'HAHA! Oh Jesus... Defo more than 25/30... What a waste of money.'

Summer added: 'Have you not learnt by STALKING my page non stop for the past year that I will call anyone out and post it on my stories'

Summer also answered a question about what she would not put up with in a boyfriend, saying: 'I have zero tolerance for b******t and games'.

The social media star recently denied that she is dating Hollyoaks actor Fabrizio Santino, 37, after they were pictured looking cosy with one another. 

Summer confirmed again she is still single as a fan asked her: 'Summer you look so happy, have you found Mr Right?'

She replied: 'NO! Still wading my way through disappointments'.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Paul Hollywood for comment.  

The model also answered a frequently asked question about whether or not her breasts are 'real'.

She said: 'FAQ! Yes. I've heard so many rumours that they're fake! They're real people'.    

Summer has been living with her mother Sabina and the family at their rural home ever since moving back in following her break-up with Bake Off judge Paul last year.

Ex: Answering a fan question, Summer said: 'HAHA! Oh Jesus... Defo more than 25/30... What a waste of money' 

Her sole focus has been on her seven horses and two foals - Rainbow and Storm.

She previously admitted how she was 'besotted' with Paul when their romance first began but was warned by her mother that relationship could 'explode'.

Summer dated the TV star for two years before the relationship imploded in arguments and legal battles.

Their romance attracted an avalanche of headlines as Paul treated Summer to countless lavish gifts and even purchased a £1million house in Kent for them to share back in February of last year. 

Single: Summer confirmed again she is still single as a fan asked her: 'Summer you look so happy, have you found Mr Right?' 

Natural: The model also answered a frequently asked question about whether or not her breasts are 'real'

However, things came crashing down when Paul asked Summer to sign a non-disclosure agreement drafted up by his lawyers, which she refused to do.

She also revealed that she is taking her former flame to court for £4,000 over her two horse shelters, built at his £800,000 Kent farmhouse last year.

Summer claimed she'd been left with 'no alternative' but to take legal action against the Bake Off judge four months after they ended their two-year relationship.

'Games': Summer also answered a question about what she would not put up with in a boyfriend, saying: 'I have zero tolerance for b******t and games'

She told MailOnline: 'All I have ever wanted was to get back what is rightfully mine - stuff I bought with my own savings... he's punishing my horses with his spite.'

The social media influencer purchased the first stable when she moved her horses to his Grade II listed home in January, and built the second in March for her mare who was pregnant.

'I'm incredibly disappointed that I've had to choose this course of action against Paul', she said. 'Dealing with Paul is a nightmare - everything is done through his lawyers.'
