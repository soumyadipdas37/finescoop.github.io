Fitness entrepreneur Kayla Itsines looked rather glum while out shopping in Adelaide on Sunday, just two weeks after announcing her split from fiancé Tobi Pearce.

The 29-year-old, whose at-home workout empire is worth almost $700million, failed to raise a smile while strolling through the Burnside Village shopping centre.

She showed off her famous abs in a cropped grey sweater and matching high-waisted shorts, which she paired with white sneakers and Adidas socks.

You okay, hun? Fitness entrepreneur Kayla Itsines looked rather glum while out shopping in Adelaide on Sunday, just two weeks after announcing her split from fiancé Tobi Pearce

She carried a shopping bag from makeup store Mecca Maxima, and pulled her dark hair back in a sporty ponytail.

At one stage, she checked her phone while leaving a store.

The Bikini Body Guide founder confirmed her split from Tobi, who is the father of her one-year-old daughter, Arna Leia Pearce, on August 21.

'After eight years together, Tobi and I have come to the difficult decision to separate as a couple. We will always be family, and remain good friends and devoted parents to Arna,' Kayla told her 12.6 million Instagram followers.

'We have grown up together in Adelaide, sharing a lifetime of experiences and special memories from moving into our first apartment and starting SWEAT from our lounge room to becoming parents to our beautiful daughter. 

'Our friendship remains strong as we parent Arna together and run SWEAT as business partners. Thank you for your support and kindness during this time.'

In 2018, Forbes estimated the couple's shared net worth to be $696million.

The couple welcomed their first child together, daughter Arna Leia, in April 2019, just two months after Tobi had surprised Kayla with an engagement party.

After meeting in late 2012, the pair launched the Bikini Body Training Company and went on to amass a following of more than 20 million fitness enthusiasts worldwide thanks to their workouts, app and health books.

They were named joint fifth on the Australian Financial Review's Young Rich List for 2018, making them the wealthiest self-made twentysomethings in Australia.

Their fitness empire helps people to transform their bodies and achieve dramatic weight loss at the gym or from home.

Kayla started out in the fitness industry when she was left in charge of the Adelaide gym where she worked by an absent manager in the late 2000s.

The then-teenager began honing a program to target the problem areas for women - including abs, arms and thighs - and soon attracted an online following.

She decided to capitalise on her growing fan base in 2012 by building up her profile on social media.

'It was then I decided to build a presence on Instagram and Facebook, in order to share my training and nutrition method,' she wrote on her website. 

'By uploading client transformations, healthy eating ideas and some training tips, I was able to inspire thousands of women to move towards a healthier lifestyle and nothing makes me happier.' 

She developed her Bikini Body Guide fitness program, which sees women around the world embark on exercise missions and showcase their progress online.

Hundreds of thousands of women worldwide spend $19.99 a month on the program. Itsines and her fiancé Tobi Pearce created the workout and nutritional plan in 2014.

She then created the hugely popular app Sweat With Kayla - which was the most-downloaded fitness app on both iOS and Google Play in 2016 and raked in $17million in revenues.

Her empire also includes paid-for ebooks, a stadium tour and hardcover bestsellers.
