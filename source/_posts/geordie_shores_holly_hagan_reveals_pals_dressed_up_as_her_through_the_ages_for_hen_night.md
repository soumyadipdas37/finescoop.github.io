'I got the shock of my life when I was presented with a catwalk of multiple versions of myself over the past decade.

'It seems throughout my outfit and hair choices I was always trying to find what category I fit into.

'I used to hate the old versions of me I was made to feel embarrassed and ashamed of her.

'I don't feel like that any more. Each of those versions of myself was loving, kind, generous and a great friend.

'Happy, confident and living my best life with the man of my dreams every single day.'

The woman of the hour and her nearest and dearest let their hair down as they boogied to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's hit single WAP.

Following in the footsteps of Nathan, Holly tried her hand at twerking to music played by their own DJ.

The duo later relished in a spot of karaoke as they belted the lyrics to Jennifer Hudson's 2008 track Spotlight.

Last May, Holly gushed about her three-year relationship with the sportsman in an interview with MailOnline.

The blonde beauty enthused: 'I've never been in a relationship with someone who has loved me back. It's the first time I've ever felt that.' 

Their romance has gone from strength-to-strength as she packed up and left her Teesside home to start her new life in Manchester last year.

Hinting at an engagement just weeks before the sweet moment took place, Holly added: 'I'm hoping for a ring, anytime now would be great. I'm just waiting for it.'

The TV star faced crippling anxiety two years ago when her toxic relationship with former co-star Kyle Christie came to an end. 

At the height of her mental health battle, she suffered from panic attacks, lost her confidence and self esteem - with the thought of even going to the supermarket being too much to handle.

'So when I got with Jacob I realised when you're with the right person, it's so easy you don't have to fight at all. It's the most natural thing in the world.

'I don't regret the relationship with Kyle because it taught me so much, I learned everything I know from that relationship. It only made me a stronger person.' 

Before her three-year romance with Kyle, 27, broke down in March 2017, Holly briefly dated fellow reality star James Tindale and X Factor star Frankie Cocozza in 2011.
