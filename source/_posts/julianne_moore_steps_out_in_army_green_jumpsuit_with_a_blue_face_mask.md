This sighting comes after she was seen in the trailer for The Glorias.

Four different actresses channel feminist icon Steinem in the Julie Taymor biopic, which starts streaming on Amazon Prime Video/VOD on September 30.

The 59-year-old Oscar winner - who most resembles the 86-year-old women's rights activist - portrays her after age 40.

Alicia Vikander, 31, plays Gloria from ages 20–40 when she co-founded Ms. magazine and helped campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment.

The trailer - which dropped Thursday - did not include the teenage and child versions of Steinem played by Lulu Wilson and Ryan Kira Armstrong, respectively.

'They are able to interact with each other, literally sit next to each other on that Greyhound bus traveling to the next march on Washington, or rally against abortion laws, or protest against injustices or conference on the equal amendment rights,' the 67-year-old filmmaker told People on Wednesday.

'They also can take each other's place in the middle of a scene.'

The legendary Bette Midler took on the role of New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug, who co-founded the National Women's Political Caucus with Gloria.  

Orange Is the New Black scene stealer Lorraine Toussaint portrays lawyer Florynce 'Flo' Kennedy, who also helped found the National Women's Political Caucus.

R&B songstress Janelle Monáe (Harriet, Hidden Figures) plays the co-founder of Ms. magazine, Dorothy Pitman Hughes.

'Gloria is a living leader - a hero because she carved out her course in life against many odds and made it work for herself and for millions of women,' Taymor told the mag. 

'Her humility, her ability to listen, her humor, her ease with she moves across cultural, racial and gender lines. She is the great communicator. I love her positive attitude to conflict. She is always looking to 'the upside of the downside' and one of her great expressions is, "The truth will set you free but first it will p*** you off."'
