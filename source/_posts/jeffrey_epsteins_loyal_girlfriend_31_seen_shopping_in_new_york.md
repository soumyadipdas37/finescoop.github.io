Obsessively jealous and fiercely loyal, this is the woman who called herself Jeffery Epstein’s girlfriend and was the last person to speak with the monstrous pedophile before his prison death last August.

Seen here exclusively and for the first time since her identity was revealed in March, Karyna Shuliak, 31, was with Epstein on his private jet when he was arrested last July as the FBI swooped on him when he landed from Paris back at Teterboro, New Jersey.

Shuliak, from Belarus, was known as ‘the inspector’ for her obsessive snooping on Epstein during their relationship that lasted up to a decade.

Now, DailyMail.com has these exclusive pictures that offer the first glimpse of Shuliak's furtive existence since then.

Dressed casually in white shorts and a lilac polo shirt, with her long brown hair pulled back into a loose ponytail, nothing about Shuliak’s lowkey appearance suggests the world of wealth and depravity in which she once moved.

Shuliak spent close to an hour inside a nutritional health store on New York’s Upper East Side before browsing the aisles of a nearby pharmacy and purchasing toiletries, including hair care products, photos taken last week show.

She was spotted just a few blocks away from Epstein’s imposing Beaux Arts mansion near Central Park. 

Epstein is now known to have committed countless crimes and entertained some of the richest and most powerful people in the world, including Prince Andrew, in that Upper East Side property. It is now on the market at an asking price of $88 million.

Shuliak herself was pictured coming and going from the home on numerous occasions, including exclusive pictures obtained by DailyMail.com back in December 2015 and again in June 2016.

But her relationship with the disgraced financier stretched back much further than that.

Shuliak arrived in the US in 2009 and the then 20-year-old is understood to have come to Epstein’s attention soon afterwards.

The depth of her significance and loyalty to the late 66-year-old financier came to light only recently with the testimony of a source in their circle.

The source told DailyMail.com that, while many friends and associates dropped Epstein following his sex crime conviction in Florida in August 2010, Shuliak remained loyal.

Back then Epstein served 18 months – much of it on day release – for a single count of procuring a girl below the age of 18 for prostitution. The leniency of the charges and the sentencing has long been the subject of public outrage.

But according to the source: ‘Everyone turned their back on him after prison and denounced him as an anti-Christ.

‘Even his closest friends. No one stayed with him except Karyna who was there until the very last moment.’

Shuliak took part in a same-sex marriage to Jennifer Kalin (left), another of Epstein’s associates, in October 2013 and divorced her last July following the pedophile’s arrest. The Daily News reported this as a sham marriage designed to keep Shuliak in the US

Epstein paid for Shuliak's mother's expensive medical treatment, and may have helped fund the upscale home where her parents live in Minsk, the largely rundown capital of Belarus (pictured) 

Unlike Epstein’s high-profile ex-girlfriend and alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, Shuliak has had no public dealings with the FBI. 

And it has been previously reported that she had no exposure to the pedophile’s sex-trafficking activity.

But the closeness and duration of their relationship and Shuliak’s jealousy over the man she believed to have loved her may raise some questions as to just what she knew.

The same source told DailyMail.com: ‘Karyna was nicknamed, ‘’the inspector,” because she was madly jealous over Epstein and was always investigating who he was in contact with.’

Certainly, her own relationship with Epstein was one that saw her indebted to the late billionaire in more ways than one.

Epstein paid for expensive medical treatment required by her mother and reportedly may have helped fund the upscale home in which her parents now live in the Belarus capital, Minsk.

For her part, Shuliak attended Columbia University, an education that appears likely to have been funded by Epstein.

In a bizarre twist, she is a registered dentist in the states of Florida and California and is listed as having her own practice in the Virgin Islands at an address linked to Epstein.

DailyMail.com has previously revealed that a dentist’s chair was among the items that Epstein had shipped to his private island in the Caribbean while photographs also show that he had a dentist chair at his Florida mansion.

It is understood that he used to fix up the teeth of women close to him – a duty that, with her training, Shuliak could have easily performed.

Public records show that Shuliak was registered as living at Epstein’s Palm Beach home between 2015 and 2018. She is also registered as living on his private island from 2013 to the present day.

Shuliak is said to have been ‘devastated’ and blindsided by his death. He was found hanging in cell in New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges last August. There was, apparently, nothing in his last communications to suggest that he was a, ‘despairing, despondent, suicidal person'

But while Epstein may have funded much of her life in the States it was at considerable cost to Shuliak, whose virginity he reportedly took. 

And while she viewed herself as his girlfriend, she might be equally considered a victim by others.

Shuliak took part in a same-sex marriage to Jennifer Kalin, another of Epstein’s associates, in October 2013 and divorced her last July following the pedophile’s arrest.

The Daily News reported this as a sham marriage designed to keep Shuliak in the US.

Speaking in general terms about arranged marriages, Epstein’s victims’ lawyer Sigrid McCawley said this was a known instrument of the billionaire’s international sex-trafficking scheme.

According to McCawley: ‘Jeffery Epstein’s international sex trafficking ring harmed an incomprehensible number of girls and these sham same-sex marriages served a basic and important purpose for Epstein’s trafficking operation because they enabled Epstein to get citizenship for girls he wanted to keep in this country without facing a high level of scrutiny in the citizenship process.’

But whatever the true nature and complexity of her relationship with the depraved predator, Shuliak is said to have been ‘devastated’ and blindsided by his death.

He was found hanging in cell in New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges last August.

There was, apparently, nothing in his last communications to suggest that he was a, ‘despairing, despondent, suicidal person.’
