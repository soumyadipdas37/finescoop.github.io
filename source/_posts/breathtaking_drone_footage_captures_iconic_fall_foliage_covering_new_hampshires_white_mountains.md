Fall is finally here. With pumpkin spice lattes making an appearance in coffee shops, apple picking back on the list of weekend plans and Halloween just around the corner, that also means it's that time of year again where New England is arguably at its most beautiful. 

And if this stunning drone footage taken over the treetops on New Hampshire's White Mountains is anything to go by, this year's scenery certainly doesn't disappoint.  

The breathtaking footage, shared by Michael Holzwarth on Instagram, shows the incredible foliage transforming into vibrant hues of red, orange and yellow as New England welcomes in the fall.

The video takes the viewer on a journey above the trees, flying through the incredible natural landscape while the mountains loom up into the clouds in the background. 

It begins with a sea of red, orange and yellow foliage, dotted with touches of green as the last of Summer fades away.

Holzwarth, of Waltham, told Boston.com he filmed the incredible fall scenery with his drone at the weekend. 

'We're lucky to have such natural beauty within driving distance from the city,' he said.

New Hampshire is widely known for its breathtaking scenery in the fall, attracting millions of visitors from far and wide to see the colorful autumnal display.

The mesmerizing change in colors typically begins in mid to late August when the lush green foliage of the Summer begins to fade and be replaced by hues of red, yellow and orange.

By September and October, the colors of the leaves become more vibrant until they reach their peak brightness. 

According to New Hampshire's latest fall foliage report, the White Mountains are nearing their peak conditions.

'Colors are really coming to life in the White Mountains, with near-peak conditions being reported in the western towns of Lincoln/Woodstock, Campton/Thornton, and Waterville Valley,' it said. 

'The rest of the White Mountains continue to see great color development, although leaf peepers should pay special attention to Franconia Notch, Bretton Woods, and Crawford Notch as these areas are currently displaying incredibly vibrant colors!'

'A scenic drive along Route 49 through Campton should do the trick and will treat you to awe-inspiring views of the colorful foliage in action.'
