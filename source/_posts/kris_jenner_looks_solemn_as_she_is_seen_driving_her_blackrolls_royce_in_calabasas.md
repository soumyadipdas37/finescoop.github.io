It was announced this week that her family's hit reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be coming to an end after 20 seasons on E! 

And Kris Jenner looked solemn as she cruised through Calabasas in her black Rolls Royce on Wednesday afternoon.

The 64-year-old matriarch had on a pair of large designer shades and she rocked her iconic pixie cut for her errand run.

The entire Kardashian clan took to their various social media pages on Tuesday to announce the end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

The announcement was an open love letter to the devout fan following they have  accumulated over their 14-years on the air, but it did not explicitly state a reason for pulling the plug on the series.

It did reveal that the final season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians would air 'early next year in 2021.'

Sources close to the situation claimed to TMZ that the Kardashian-Jenner family decided to step away from the show because their 'brand [gets] way more play on social media outlets and through their personal businesses than on TV.'

According to the sources, the Kardashians initially used their television series, which premiered in 2007, as a means of marketing themselves and the plethora of products they have put out over the years.

But with the growth of social media and streaming platforms threatening the fate of cable, motivation to maintain the series diminished.     

'Social media has largely replaced what "Keeping Up" once provided,' explained the source.

Each member of the Kardashian-Jenner family, the females in particularly, have found themselves in the top ranks in terms of Instagram followings.

Kylie Jenner, 23, is currently the third most followed female user on the platform, with 195million followers. 

Kim, 39, who is undoubtedly the star of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, has amassed 188million followers. Kendall, 24, Khloe, 36, and Kourtney, 41, all have over 100million followers.

Keeping Up With The Kardashians was also allegedly suffering from low viewership, in comparison to prior seasons of the show.

The source added that this drop in viewership may be due to 'people watching in different ways these days, including streaming.' 

Prior outlets reported that Kris and her offspring used money as motivation for leaving the reality series, with Kris allegedly asking for '$40 mil per season for a handful of more years.'

But, according to TMZ's insiders, money was not at the heart of the departure, instead the family felt that it was 'just time to move on, and chase opportunities elsewhere.'   

'We're told not one person or incident specifically ended the show,' the outlet stated.

After making their television exit, the Kardashian-Jenner family is allegedly 'planning to stay off-camera for a while and enjoy themselves, while reassessing what might be next for them as a unit.'
