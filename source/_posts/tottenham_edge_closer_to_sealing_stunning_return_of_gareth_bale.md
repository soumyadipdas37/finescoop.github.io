Tottenham were thrashing out a deal on Tuesday night to see former hero Gareth Bale make a sensational return to the club.

On a dramatic day of high-level discussions - led by chairman Daniel Levy - Spurs believe they have moved into a position where they have a realistic opportunity of snatching the Real Madrid star from under the noses of rivals Manchester United.

Sportsmail understands Real Madrid will agree to pay in-excess of 50 percent of the Wales international's astronomical wages of up to £500,000-per-week in order to facilitate the deal.

Tottenham Hotspur are edging closer to a sensational deal which will see Gareth Bale return

Tottenham are believed to have explored a loan or a permanent deal, which could include a swap for one of the club's premium first-team players, for Bale Levy, who was also trying to close a deal for Real's highly-rated left-back Sergio Reguilon yesterday, was at the forefront of Tottenham's negotiations yesterday.

And, as of last night, the north London club were confident they could land a player they sold for a then world record fee of £85.3million in 2013.

Tottenham have explored the idea of trying to lure Bale back to Premier League in previous seasons - but this is the closest they have gone to making a deal a reality.

United retain an interest in signing Bale as an alternative to Jadon Sancho, but Tottenham feel they are in pole position.

Spurs were also locked in advanced talks to sign £25million-rated Reguilon from the Bernabeu yesterday.

Similarly, United have an interest in the Spain international, who spent last season on loan at Sevilla but are set to be pipped by Spurs.

It is understood that Reguilon was originally attracted by a move to Old Trafford but the 23-year-old has been made aware of how desperate manager Jose Mourinho is to work with him, which has made a move to Spurs a very strong possibility.

Real are understood to want a buy-back clause in any departure for Reguilon, and Spurs are said to be more open to agreeing to that stipulation than United.
