Eniko Hart is getting in some final fitness before the arrival of her second child with actor-comedian Kevin Hart. 

The stunning star looked ready to pop at 40-weeks as she worked up a full-body sweat in a grey sports bra and form-fitting leggings on Wednesday. 

'Just a little morning motivation,' the 36-year-old Fabletics ambassador wrote on her Instagram Story, as she shared footage of herself squatting low and lifting weights.

As she rotated between a few moderately intense activities, the model intensified her workout on a medicine ball with a resistance band and appeared at ease. 

Eventually, she pulled her stunning curls back into a tousled bun, while keeping her heart rate up. 

During her workout, she blared Gamma Skies's 2019 pop track, Wilder, through her speakers and looked focused.

As the fit star exercised, she gave fans a close-up look at her home gym, which included motivational quotes on the walls, including one, which read: 'Everyone wants to be famous, but no one wants to put the work in.'  

Additionally, the room was full of natural light, which poured out of the floor-to-ceiling windows, that overlooked her swimming pool and expansive backyard. 

Her training session comes just two days after she announced she would be doing her 'last workout of this pregnancy.'

Throughout her second pregnancy Eniko has also kept regularly active, switching up gym days with water aerobics and even bike-riding as she sees fit. 

Eniko and Kevin, 41, have been married for four years and have two-year-old son Kenzo Kash who will now be gaining a baby sister after revealing 'Baby K's' gender on Mother's Day.

The comedian has been married previously, sharing two children, 15-year-old daughter Heaven and 12-year-old son Hendrix, with his ex-wife of eight years Torrei Hart.
