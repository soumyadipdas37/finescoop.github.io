Her family shocked the world yesterday with the announcement their hit reality series would be ending next year.

But Kourtney Kardashian didn't dwell on the topic as she enjoyed another day on the lake on Wednesday.

The reality star, 41, shared yet another photo from her idyllic forest getaway, this time one of her laying out in her hot pink bikini by the water.

Aside from her blue hat and bathing suit, Kourtney was wearing next to nothing. 

The star appeared to be lounging on the edge of a boat, where she seductively laid out on a padded deck.

With her attention placed on the horizon, the star gazed away from the camera while placing her thumb beside her mouth.

Kourtney cheekily captioned the shot 'too hip to take a dip,' perhaps referencing the leggy angle at which she was laying at.

'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. 

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.

Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.

'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'

'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'

Kourtney has been vocal about her reluctance to appear on the show in recent years, butting heads with her sisters over the matter before finally quitting the series.

'I was feeling unfulfilled and it became a toxic environment for me to continue to have it occupy as much of my life as it was,' she told Vogue Arabia of her decision to leave.

'Life was moving so, so fast, even after taking a break from the show and attempting to slow down and give more time to my kids… It wasn't until this time that I have been able to learn their needs again, see their strengths, and be able to be connected as deeply as I once was, before juggling so much.'
