Callum Wilson has confirmed that he will not be taking the No 9 shirt of Newcastle's £40million record-signing Joelinton and will instead wear the No 13 in his debut campaign for the Magpies.

After a dismal campaign in his debut season at St James' Park, Joelinton risked being stripped of the iconic number after managing just two goals for the club in 38 Premier League appearances.

Club legends Alan Shearer and Micky Quinn both wore the No 9 shirt for the Magpies, leaving some fans dismayed that Joelinton now occupied it.

After a dismal debut campaign, £40m record-buy Joelinton risked losing the iconic No 9 shirt 

However, Wilson has rubbished suggestions that he would become the club's new No 9, claiming such a decision would hurt team harmony.  

'The club record signing wears No 9,' Wilson said. 'I want to add to the dressing room, not disrupt it. No 13 means a lot to me and that’s why I’ve worn it for the last six years.'

The striker finalised the terms of a four-year deal on Monday morning, sealing his £20m switch from Bournemouth.

Wilson insisted that the call from the Magpies was too good to resist and is now hoping to make a big impact on Tyneside.

The 28-year-old said on Monday: 'From the minute I knew that Newcastle were interested, it was definitely something that appealed to me.

'It's a massive club with great history. Along the years, they've had great strikers so if I can emulate half of what they've done, I'd like to attempt that.

'I believe in my ability as a player. As a striker I think it's important to set yourself goals long term and short term, and I'm hoping to achieve them.

'With the players around me, I believe we can get the goals we need as team and I want to help contribute to that.'
