The BBC has been blasted for promoting a new drill rap track from a former county lines drug dealer. amid the controversial move to axe Rule Brittania from the Proms.
The new release by Potter Payper, who used to push crack and heroin, was played on Radio 1Xtra despite its clear references to guns and cannabis, The Sun&nbsp;reports.
It made its way onto the airwaves despite the corporation sparking outrage by banning much-loved anthems Rule Brittania and Land of Hope and Glory, over fears of a race row.&nbsp;
Potter Payper, whose real name is Jamel Bousbaa, was sentenced to five years in prison in 2018 for running an operation to smuggle drugs out of London to the seaside town of Clacton, Essex, according to the Barking and Dagenham Post.
Potter Payper recently posted an image of him smoking outside BBC headquarters on Instagram
He was released from jail in June and is now looking to kickstart his music career after &#039;Daily Duppy&#039; was broadcast on DJ Snoochie Shy&#039;s show, just days before the BBC announced its plan to axe songs from the Proms.
Tory MP David Morris told the Sun&nbsp;&#039;This is another belter from the blundering BBC.
&#039;On the week we&#039;ve had the Beeb try and stop Brits from singing Land of Hope and Glory, they are now telling the nation to listen to a county lines, drug-smuggling criminal instead, and just weeks after he got out of jail.&#039;
A poll this week found the&nbsp;majority of Britons believe the BBC&nbsp;made the wrong decision over the Proms.
The survey shows more than half of people oppose the move, which comes amid claims that people are offended by the lyrics of the much-loved anthems - because they are &#039;racist&#039;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
As it stands, the patriotic songs will be played by an orchestra only on September 12, supposedly because the lack of an audience will diminish their impact.&nbsp;
The BBC has faced a backlash following its decision to ban popular anthems from the Last Night of the Proms
God Save the Queen and Jerusalem will still be played in full at the event, led by Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, 35, which will take place without an audience and with limited performers.
Now YouGov research for The Times shows 55 per cent of people surveyed oppose the move to cut the lyrics from the two songs, compared to 16 per cent who back the decision.&nbsp;
Five per cent of people polled believe the songs should not be performed at all at the Last Night of the Proms.&nbsp;
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is among the critics of the BBC&#039;s decision, saying this week&nbsp;&#039;I think it&#039;s time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history.&#039;
A BBC spokesman told MailOnline &#039;1Xtra provides a platform for live music across a range of genres with individual performances booked and recorded in line with audience expectations.&#039;
