Manchester United were reportedly close to signing Thiago Alcantara in 2013, but new manager David Moyes opted to sign Marouane Fellaini instead. 

Moyes took charge of United seven years ago, after Sir Alex Ferguson retired following 26 successful years at the club. 

Ferguson, according to ESPN, had already set a deal in motion to sign Thiago - then at Barcelona - but Moyes reportedly pulled the plug because he did not know enough about the Spanish midfielder, instead buying Fellaini from former club Everton. 

Thiago Alcantara could have joined Manchester United in 2013 but joined Bayern Munich

David Moyes instead decided to sign Everton midfielder Marouane Fellaini on deadline-day

Moyes, who signed a six-year contract, did not even last a season as he was sacked in April 2014.  

Thiago instead joined Bayern Munich and has since won seven Bundesliga titles and a few weeks' ago won the Champions League. 

The 29-year-old only has a year left on his contract at Bayern and though United are again interested, Thiago is being heavily linked this summer with a move to Premier League champions Liverpool. 

Thiago won the Champions League with Bayern but reportedly is set on a new challenge 

Fellaini did have a somewhat successful career at Old Trafford, winning an FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League before departing for Shandong Luneng in 2019. 

The Belgian was bought on deadline-day by Moyes in a summer window where he also missed out on former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, as reported by The Sun. 

Meanwhile, Thiago - who is currently on international duty - refused to comment on speculation linking him with a move away. 

The 29-year-old Spanish international refused to speculate about his future on Saturday 

'I have not told anyone that I'm leaving,' Thiago said on Saturday ahead of Spain's game against Ukraine on Sunday. 

'Every year, they put me in a different club. For me my future is tomorrow's game (against Ukraine) and there is nothing more to say. 

'I neither care nor am I interested. What interests me is tomorrow'
