She's a proud mum to six gorgeous children.

Fans swooned over the heartwarming snap, and several noted that Lucia is 'the twin' of her mother as the pair beamed alongside Antonia's mum, Janelle.

'WOW! Your daughter looks just like you!' one fan gushed, while another wrote: 'Oh she looks like your twin!'

'Your daughter looks so Much like Nicole, Genetics are so strong in your family, beautiful,' a third wrote, in a nod to Antonia's actress sister, Nicole Kidman.

She beamed as she leaned on her gorgeous daughter, who sported an elegant white lace dress and brown knee-high boots.

Her mum, Janelle, donned a pretty floral scarf and a grey jumper as she smiled for the three-generation family photo.

In addition to Lucia, Antonia is a proud mother to daughter Sybella and her four sons, Hamish, James, Nicholas and Alexander.

In June, Antonia revealed she was thinking about adding to her family of six by getting a dog.

She wrote in her column for 9Honey that now her family was back living in Australia, after almost a decade in Singapore, the idea of getting a pet was on the cards.

She wrote that the love a dog owner has for their pet 'seems so unconditional, solid and enormous and I don't want to go through life without experiencing it'.
