The UFC will return to Fight Island this month with five events, beginning with UFC 253 and ending with UFC 254, to be hosted in the Middle East, according to ESPN.

The venue, which is situated on Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, was used to host UFC 251 in July, where Kamaru Usman defeated late replacement Jorge Masvidal in their welterweight title bout. 

The UFC has since returned to Las Vegas, where numerous events have been held at the promotion's APEX, with Daniel Cormier losing to Stipe Miocic at UFC 252 last month at the venue.

The UFC is set to return to Fight Island for a series of events starting this month

The mixed martial arts promotion used the venue for four events earlier this year to success

And according to ESPN's Brett Okamoto, the UFC is planning to stage five events at Fight Island in the coming months.

The report suggests that the action on Fight Island will begin with Israel Adesanya defending his middleweight title against Paulo Costa at UFC 253, and will end with Khabib Nurmagomedov and Justin Gaethje fighting for the lightweight crown at UFC 254.

Fight Island has served as a hub for fights involving international athletes, with all fighters and coaches tested for coronavirus before entering the bubble. 

Dana White made global headlines after securing the private island as a venue to host events during the pandemic, but the UFC supremo has since spoken glowingly of the unique location.  

UFC 253 will reportedly be hosted on Fight Island as will Khabib Nurmagomedov's title bout
