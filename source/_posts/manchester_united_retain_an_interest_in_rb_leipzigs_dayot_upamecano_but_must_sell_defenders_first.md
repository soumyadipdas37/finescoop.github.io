Manchester United remain interested in signing RB Leipzig centre-back Dayot Upamecano.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is eager to strengthen his side's defensive options, especially after they started their Premier League season with a 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace.

As reported by The Telegraph, United remain interested in signing Upamecano but must sell some of their centre-backs if they are to pursue a deal for the Frenchman.

Leipzig are determined to keep Upamecano, who signed a new contract in July that runs until the summer of 2023.

United have a host of centre-backs on their books, but the likes of Phil Jones, who is currently injured, and Marcos Rojo, who is back from a loan spell at Estudiantes, are proving difficult to sell.

Chris Smalling is eager to play regularly after impressing on loan at Roma and could depart United permanently.

Solskjaer deployed a centre-back pairing of Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire for the defeat to Palace, with Eric Bailly on the bench.

Axel Tuanzebe, meanwhile, isn't yet fully fit, but will hope to be involved in some capacity when he is back available. 

Upamecano has frequently impressed for Leipzig, and, at the age of 21, has much time on his side to improve even further.
