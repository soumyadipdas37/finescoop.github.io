Frank Ocean responded to Tuesday night's tense presidential debate by launching a voter registration website for his fans.

The 32-year-old Sweet Life singer referenced the debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in a text post shared to his Instagram stories.

aHe wrote that 'It all feels fake,' while encouraging his fans to focus on making sure they were registered to vote rather than watching the debate.

'Debates are on. It all feels fake,' Ocean wrote. 'The problem's that it's not.

'Donald is president and might not leave the White House even if he loses the race so some say,' he continued, referencing Trump's claims that he would only accept the outcome of the election if he were judged the winner. 

The president and his campaign have also said in recent days that they'll likely be taking up the election results with the Supreme Court, though the Court doesn't have a standard role in determining the winner.

'Pls vote. Watching him dragged out will be way more entertaining than these debates.'

Ocean urged his fans to visit his website Blonded.co, which was originally created to promote his second studio album Blonde (2016).

He added that the 'form just takes 2 minutes to fill out.'

The newly redesigned site featured a rolling banner at the top reading, 'Vote,' along with artwork featuring eyeglasses filled with a blue star and red and white strips, along with a disturbing black and white photo of a smile with gold tooth.

The page also included a clock counting down until the November 3 general election.

The form to begin the registration process was supplied by Vote.org.

He also offered to send free merchandise to people voting in election with key Democratic candidates.

Joining Ocean in his call for people to vote was his Odd Future collective member and frequent collaborator Tyler, the Creator.

On Monday, he posted a video revealing he would be voting for the first time in the 2020 election, and he urged his fans to do the same. 

'Please, please, if you are young, and your f***ing back don't hurt, go to them polls and cast a f***ing vote. And I didn't give a f*** about none of this s***, just like a lot of y'all. This is actually gonna be my first time voting. But I... I see the light,' he said.
