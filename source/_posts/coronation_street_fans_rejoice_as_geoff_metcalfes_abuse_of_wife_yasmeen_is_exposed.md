It's been a moment long-awaited in a year that's seen the COVID-19 pandemic. 

And Coronation Street fans were euphoric on Wednesday as Geoff Metcalfe's vile abuse of his wife Yasmeen was finally revealed.

Viewers rushed to Twitter as Tim finally disowned his dad and left him to be arrested by police, after seeing a video of him taunting and abusing his wife despite months of proclaiming his innocence.

At last! Coronation Street fans were euphoric on Wednesday as Geoff Metcalfe's vile abuse of his wife Yasmeen was finally revealed

For weeks Tim (played by Joe Duttine) has found himself at odds with his wife Sally, who is convinced that Geoff (Ian Bartholomew) has abused and controlled Yasmeen (Shelley King). 

His horrific behaviour eventually led Yasmeen to lash out and stab him with a broken bottle, and she has since been sent to prison to await trial.

Despite her best efforts to expose Geoff, Sally (Sally Dynevor) has battled her father-in-law at every turn, as he succeeded in deleting CCTV footage of his treatment of his wife.

But finally Tim's daughter Faye discovered a video of the moment Geoff belittled and taunted his wife following his magic performance, while forcing a phone camera in her face.

As Tim finally saw the truth he confronted his father, who insisted he was innocent and hadn't done anything wrong.

But it was too late as the police arrived to ask Geoff to come to the station for questioning as 'new evidence' has been brought to light.

The episode ended with Tim disowning his father as he was taken away by police, sparking delight from fans who have followed the hard-hitting storyline for months on end.

One wrote: 'Dan and I are in our absolute element watching Tim lay into Geoff. Love Tim. Favourite character. Finally it all comes out.'

Over the moon: The episode ended with Tim disowning his father as he was taken away by police, sparking a thunderous reaction from fans on Twitter

Fans were forced to endure Geoff's horrific abuse of his wife Yasmeen for weeks, and have been waiting for his family to finally learn the truth.

It currently remains to be seen whether Yasmeen will found guilty of attacking her husband.

Bosses have already teased the long-running storyline may not conclude until the end of the year, especially since the number of weekly episodes was halved due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the soap returning to its usual schedule next week. 

While many viewers have been outraged by the hard-hitting plot, there's no doubt they tuned in greater numbers than Corrie had seen for months, as the soap saw it's highest figures since January 2019.
