She's used to juggle many work duties as she continues to take the entertainment industry by storm. 

And Maya Jama put on a cheery display as she was seen leaving a photoshoot for Wonderland in Fitzrovia on Tuesday evening.

The DJ, 26, opted for comfort in an iridescent tracksuit from adidas Originals' Alexander Wang range after spending the day modelling elegant dresses.

Cutting a casual figure, the media personality nailed sporty chic in the two-piece, which featured a waterproof pullover and matching joggers.

The former BBC Radio 1 star maintained her dressed-down display in the footwear department as she ditched her signature heels in favour of grey slippers.

Online sensation Maya kept her radiant make-up for the ride home though, looking sensational in dewy foundation, winged eyeliner and brown lipgloss.

In the work department, Maya has been hotly tipped to replace Holly Willoughby as the new Celebrity Juice captain following her departure earlier this year.

Last month, the media personality did little to quash rumours that she would be taking over the role on Keith Lemon's comedy panel show as she filmed a secret project with the host at Shisha Gardens in Edgware. 

Further fuelling speculation, Maya wrote: 'Working with this one today was very fun.. Wanted to be just like him when I was in school & even when I started my career.. now we’re basically bezzies.. coming sooooon.' A representative for Maya declined to comment at this stage.

In May, This Morning star Holly, 39, thanked Celebrity Juice for 12 years of 'fantastic chaos' after confirming her departure from the long-running show.

The presenter, a team captain on the irreverent pop culture panel show, confirmed her departure in a lengthy Instagram post shared with followers.

Addressing fans, the blonde insisted she only had happy memories from her time alongside Keith, the alter-ego of comedian Leigh Francis.
