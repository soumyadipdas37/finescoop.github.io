A motorist has copped a $100 fine for driving her car with a goat sitting in her lap.

WA Police stopped the female driver near Hovea, northeast of Perth, on Friday morning. 

The woman was questioned by officers and told police she was taking the goat to the vet for treatment.

Her excuse wasn't enough to avoid an infringement, with the woman losing one demerit point and netting a $100 fine.

WA Police Traffic posted an image of the woman's fine on their Twitter feed, drawing some hilarious responses in the comments.

'Better than carrying it I guess,' one response reads.

'Teaching it how to drive?' another said.

Road rules and penalties regarding animals in cars vary from state to state in Australia.

As a general rule in most states, an animal must be secured in the car and not in the driver's lap to avoid getting a fine.

Fines range between $100 and $560 depending on your state. 

Under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, if an unrestrained animal is injured in a car accident, the driver can face six months in jail and a fine of $5,500.
