She's the popular Australian actress who often opens up with her fans online.

And on Wednesday, Isabelle Cornish revealed on Instagram that she'd been diagnosed with adult ADHD, describing it as the 'hardest thing' she's ever had to go through.

The Puberty Blues star, 26, shared the news alongside a glamorous selfie, and told fans she planned to give more insight into her diagnosis in the future.

'Getting diagnosed with ADHD at 26 has officially been one of the hardest things I've ever gone through,' she began.

'In the future, I plan on creating content on ADHD to hopefully give you some insight into my mind and inspire those who also live with a different disguise of brain superpowers.'

Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health condition with symptoms including trouble focusing, hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour.

According to the Mayo Clinic, the condition is treated similarly to that of childhood ADHD, with medication and counselling.

Isabelle, who is the younger sister of actress Abbie Cornish, 38, deleted the post later that evening. 

It's not the first time the actress has shared her struggles with fans.

In June, Isabelle revealed she had 'despised' her body for a year-long period while trying to keep up with the modelling industry's standards.

She shared a photo to Instagram of herself in turquoise lingerie as she explained how 'being skinny will never make you happy'.

'For years I despised my body. I hated the thought of having the shape I have now,' Isabelle wrote alongside the photo of her backside and thighs.

She added: 'I spent my critical coming-of-age years working in the entertainment and modelling industry.

'These environments did bring many unhealthy influences and conditionings, but I take full responsibility for what outside influences created in my world.'

Isabelle went on to explain that she hadn't yet understood or accepted the 'true beauty of the human form' as a teenager and young adult.

She concluded by saying people were 'more than any size or number' and urged fans to 'tune in' to their 'inner world'.
