Chris Colfer recently revealed the way his late friend and Glee co-star Naya Rivera would lift his spirits when they were low.

'A lot of people probably don't know this, but Naya had the most incredible impressions,' he shared to E! News this week.

The 30-year-old said of Naya's impersonations that she 'was always, always ready to give you one if you were in a bad mood.'

He dished: 'Yeah, she had this one of Kim Kardashian on jury duty that would always, always make me belly laugh whenever I needed it - I needed one.' 

Kim is of course now an aspiring lawyer herself and is famously a prison reform advocate, working to get multiple convicts released from jail.

Chris and Naya starred on their teen show respectively as a gay singer and lesbian cheerleader who both join the high school glee club.

Naya's body was recovered from Lake Piru in California in July, days after she went missing during a boating trip with her son Josey, five, who was found safe.

She took Josey boating on Lake Piru on July 8 and vanished - he was found asleep on the boat but she was gone, though her life jacket was on board. 

Police declared her presumed dead a day after her disappearance, and a search ensued until her body was retrieved on July 13.

At that time the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office found no sign of drugs or alcohol being involved in her accidental drowning.

An autopsy report released in September said that she raised her arm from the water and called: 'Help!' after managing to place Josey back into the boat.

The report also showed that she had recently had a sinus infection, had previous vertigo issues and had small amounts of prescribed amphetamines in her system.

However Naya's prescription medication and physical conditions were not listed in the autopsy report as factors in her death.

She shared her son with her ex-husband Ryan Dorsey, who has moved her younger sister Nickayla into his home as he attempts to father his child alone.

Ryan got candid about the living situation on Instagram after DailyMail.com exclusively spotted him and Nickayla holding hands.

During the emotional video this week he revealed that Josey requested that Nickayla move in 'because she's now the closest thing he has to a mom.'

Ryan revealed that he has 'probably lost a little over 20lbs' and 'don't really get sleep' since Naya's tragic death at the age of just 33.
