Megan Thee Stallion showed off her famous curves in a cherry red thong bikini on her Instagram page this Friday.

The 25-year-old rap star declared that 'like water I’m unbothered and relaxinnn' as she lounged in her infinity pool.

Her album also included a picture of her standing up in the water whilst facing out toward a breathtaking ocean view.

Beyonce's mother Tina Lawson gushed in the comments: 'Relax you 'be earned it looking hot and bootylicious doing it.'

Megan in turn swung by her Insta Stories this Friday to wish Beyonce a happy birthday as the Black Is King star turned 39.

She also posted a black and white picture with the birthday girl along with Blue Ivy, Beyonce's eight-year-old daughter by her husband Jay-Z.

'Happy birthday to the mf queen !!!! I will never forget the day I met you �� I was so nervous I didn’t even know what I was going to say and then when we finally spoke the conversation just flowed so naturally,' Megan wrote.

'Thank you for everything you do, thank you for all your words of encouragement, thank you for being so uplifting, and thank you for being such an inspiration in my life til this day !!!! Love you @beyonce.'

Her Instagram page recently included an album showing her cuddling up to a group of mostly female friends in what looked like a private plane.

She modeled a stylishly tight camouflage ensemble with a slick of deep scarlet lipstick and flashed a peace sign for the camera.

Megan, whose raunchy new song WAP with Cardi B became the first female rap duet to debut at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, was in Colorado earlier this week.

She could be seen taking the stage at Red Rocks Park And Amphitheatre this Tuesday as part of a three-day concert event called Red Rocks Unpaused.

The star-studded lineup for the socially distant festival included Lil Baby, Sam Hunt and Brett Young according to its website. 

When Megan released a remake of her song Savage earlier this year she featured Beyonce, who in turn paid tribute to her mother on the track.

'My mama was a savage,' rapped Beyonce, adding that she 'got this s*** from Tina' - a line she reprised on Instagram while wishing Tina a happy Mother's Day in May.

This July while she was recovering from being shot in the feet Megan revealed on Instagram that she got flowers and a get well card from Beyonce. 

In late August Megan broke her silence to publicly name Tory as the man who shot her, having previously remained mum about the alleged culprit.

Before she made her accusation Tory had already been charged for having had a concealed weapon at the time of the incident. 

The thrill of it all: Megan has also posted an Instagram video of herself sitting on a luxe bed opening up some lingerie from Rihanna's Savage X Fenty line

'Since you're all so worried about it, yes, this n**** Tory shot me,' she said while going Live on Instagram this Thursday.

'You shot me and you got got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying and s**t. Stop lying. Why lie.'

Megan asserted that she did not tell cops the full story on the night of the incident because they were 'aggressive' and she 'didn't want the police to shoot me.'

She said that although she initially refrained from telling the cops the truth to 'spare' Tory she had become 'tired' of the rumors circulating about her.

Tory allegedly shot her in both feet in the small hours of the morning on July 12 outside a party in the Hollywood Hills.

Megan was attempting to exit the SUV she and Tory were in only for him to reportedly fire his gun, according to TMZ.

In aerial footage that quickly went viral Megan could be seen leaving bloody footprints on the sidewalk and keeping her hands up for the police, whom she has said drove her to the hospital to have her injuries treated.
