While most kids celebrate their birthdays with cake, Rachael Finch gave her daughter Violet a homemade waffle topped with banana, blueberries and raw chocolate.

The 32-year-old health conscious model shared a video of her daughter blowing out the candle on her waffle on Instagram on Thursday for Violet's seventh birthday.

'Our darling girl, 7 today,' she captioned the video, adding streamer emojis.

Despite the lack of sugar, Violet still appeared excited to be celebrating her birthday, smiling happily and clapping her hands together as her family sung to her.

She sat beside her three-year-old brother, Dominic, who happily picked chocolate chips off his plate. 

In a post on Instagram Stories on Thursday, Rachael showed off their breakfasts, revealing she'd used the fruit and chocolate to make faces on their waffles.

'Birthday breakfast. I made the kiddies some waffles with fruit faces and chocolate hair, and some chocolate sauce,' she explained.

Revealing her recipe for the chocolate, she added: 'That's just made with almond butter, coconut oil and cocoa powder.'

In another video posted to Instagram Stories, Violet happily held a plate of chopped banana and said: 'We're also going to add some bananas if we need some more.'

Rachael has spoken openly about how she tries to impose a strict diet on her two young kids, who she shares with her husband of seven years, Michael Miziner.

In a post on Instagram Stories in June, Rachael revealed what she packs for Violet's school lunches, listing brown rice pasta, cauliflower, a boiled egg and veggie sticks as favourites.

In April, she revealed she gifts her kids raw chocolate eggs at Easter, and in December, she confessed she packs homemade coconut milk-based ice cream and smoothie bowls for family trips to the movies.
