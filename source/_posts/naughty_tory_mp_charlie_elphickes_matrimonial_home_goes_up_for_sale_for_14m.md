The home of 'naughty Tory' MP Charlie Elphicke has gone up for sale for £1.4million as he faces jail following his sexual assault convictions - and ahead of his impending divorce. 

The disgraced Conservative politician has listed his £1.4million property in Dover, Kent, for sale following his three-week trial and conviction on July 30.

A jury unanimously found Elphicke, 49, guilty of one count of sexual assault in 2007, and two further counts against a second woman in 2016. He is currently awaiting sentencing next Tuesday. 

The MP for Dover shared four-bedroom property The Edge with his wife Natalie Elphicke, who succeeded him as MP for the area in 2019. The St Margaret's Bay property is thought to be the most valuable in its area.

The house, which is also home to the couple's two children and which dates back to the 1920s, has been extensively modernised and renovated by the couple since they purchased it in 2012.

The property comes with four reception rooms, a spacious kitchen, and 'the best 180-degree views to be found on the SE Kent Coast' according to estate agents Strutt & Parker's website.

The sellers say the 'enviable' property also comes with half an acre of land and will afford the new owners an outlook to the White Cliffs of Dover.

The announcement of the sale comes following Ms Elphicke's announcement that she is filing for divorce despite standing by her husband's side for three-and-a-half weeks in court. 

Southwark Crown Court heard that Elphicke pounced on one of his victims as they shared a glass of wine, talking 'suggestively' about bondage and whips before plunging his hands down her blouse.

In the 2007 incident, Elphicke is said to have chased around the kitchen in his London townhouse trying to slap her bottom 'like a sketch from Benny hill' and singing 'I'm a naughty Tory' when she tried to flee.

In 2016, he twice sexually assaulted a parliamentary worker aged in her 20s, first attempting to kiss the woman and grope her breast. Elphicke will be sentenced on Tuesday.
