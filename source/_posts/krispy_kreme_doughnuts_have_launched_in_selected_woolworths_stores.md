Krispy Kreme doughnuts are now being sold at selected Woolworths stores in Australia.

The US food chain, which first arrived Down Under in 2003, is usually only available at their 30 brick-and-mortar stores nationwide or 7 Eleven convenience shops.

Six Woolworths Metro stores in New South Wales have agreed to trial selling the boxes of doughnuts throughout September.

Paddington, Potts Point, Bondi Beach, Surry Hills, Padstow and Randwick are all offering four different packs of the desserts and will rely on customer feedback in-store to decide whether they stay long-term.

The options are a three-pack or a nine-pack of doughnuts available in original glazed or assorted varieties.

A box of three original doughnuts costs $8 while three flavoured varieties is priced at $10. 

Whereas a nine-pack of original glazed is $18 and it's $23 for nine assorted.

To celebrate the release Krispy Kreme are hosting a giveaway on its Facebook page, with customers able to win a three-month supply of doughnuts.

All they need to do is tag someone they would share the doughnuts with on its latest photo, with extra points given to those who share a photo of that moment together.

The competition ends on Monday September 28 at 1.30pm AEST.

'This is so good! I can pick up my bread, milk and a doughnut during my weekly shop,' one excited shopper said.

'Woohoo! About time! I don't live anywhere near a 7 Eleven or Krispy Kreme store... but there is a Woolworths around the corner,' said another.

It's not known when the rest of Australia's Woolworths Metros will receive doughnuts or how successful the campaign has been in Sydney so far.
