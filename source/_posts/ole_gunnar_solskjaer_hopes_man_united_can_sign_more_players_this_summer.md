Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is hopeful Manchester United can make new signings before the transfer deadline after hitting a brick wall in talks over Jadon Sancho and losing out to Tottenham in the battle for Gareth Bale.

Although United have spent £40million on Donny van de Beek from Ajax, their priority was a right-sided attacker and that player has so far eluded them with less than three weeks until the window closes on October 5.

They also want a left-back but look set to be beaten by Spurs again for Real Madrid's Sergio Reguilon.

Bale will rejoin Tottenham from the Spanish club after choosing his old club over United, and Borussia Dortmund are refusing to budge on their £108m valuation of Sancho.

It has led to an angry reaction from many fans on social media as United prepare to begin the season at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday.

'Fans will always want the best possible team to watch and that's the passion we want,' said Solskjaer.

'The history we have, we can look back 10 or 20 years at the great players we had.

'We understand to get further we need to develop what we have and strengthen the team, but let's wait and see if we manage to bring anyone in.

'I've been in dialogue with the club. We're always discussing. We want to take a step forward and we can go into the new season with confidence, but we're looking to give the group a boost and we're working on it.

'Of course, we've done some business with Donny. I'm delighted to get him in. He's a smashing lad who will give us something.'

Solskjaer was reluctant to set any targets for his team as they look to close the gap on Manchester City and Liverpool after finishing third last season.

'I think we can go into the new season with confidence with the way we finished last season,' he added.

'That showed what we're capable of and we developed throughout the season.

'We need more consistency but with a year more experience we should be getting that consistency. It's a group I don't really want to say what they cannot do – they can go as far as they want themselves.

'For me, since Sir Alex left we've been averaging fifth. Last season we got third which was a big step forward.

'Everyone saw development with Bruno (Fernandes) coming in, Harry (Maguire) being captain and showing leadership skills and Aaron (Wan-Bissaka) did well.'

David de Gea (L) and Dean Henderson (R) are battling for United's No 1 spot this season

Solskjaer's big selection decision will be in goal with the ambitious Dean Henderson pushing to replace David de Gea as No 1 after returning from a loan spell at Sheffield United.

'I'm not going to tell you the team today but the goalkeeper training has been fantastic to watch, the highest possible quality you can imagine,' said the United manager.

'Some of the stuff is fantastic and it's going to be an interesting thing for many to follow.'

Paul Pogba is available after recovering from coronavirus and so is Luke Shaw following an ankle injury. Solskjaer insists that new signing Van de Beek can play in the same midfield as Pogba and Bruno Fernandes even though his signing has raised questions about how United can fit them all in at the same time.

'Of course, the three of them can start together,' said Solskjaer. 'You've got Scott McTominay, Fred and Nemanja Matic in midfield as well, it's not just about three players in a squad. I'm sure we'll see them together.'
