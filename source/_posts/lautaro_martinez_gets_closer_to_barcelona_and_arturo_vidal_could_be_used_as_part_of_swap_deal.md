Barcelona will reignite their interest in Lautaro Martinez should Inter Milan decide to sell their star striker, according to reports in Spain.

The Catalan giants have contacted Inter over his availability and are now waiting to hear back from the Italian club before making a move.

According to Spanish news outlet Sport, Barcelona will offer Arturo Vidal as part of a swap deal in a bid to secure a move for Martinez – with Inter boss Antonio Conte keen on signing the Chilean midfielder.

Vidal's deal runs until the end of June next year, but he is eager to leave the club.

Vidal made 43 appearances for Barcelona last season, scoring eight goals, but will likely leave the club this summer – with Inter leading the race for his signature. 

However, any move to the Nou Camp for Martinez is now in the balance after recent reports suggested the Argentine has been put off by the switch.

Barcelona are in meltdown at the moment and are facing a mass exodus of first-team stars under new coach Ronald Koeman.

Lionel Messi sent shockwaves through the footballing world last month after he told the club that he no longer wanted to stay – putting Europe's elite on red alert.

Koeman is also facing a mass exodus of first-team players – with Luis Suarez reportedly being shown the exit by the Dutch manager.

The toxic summer could get even worse for Barcelona, should Inter decide to try and tie Martinez down to a new contract.

The 23-year-old had a £100million release clause in his contract, which expired over the summer.

His proposed new deal could eradicate any chance of a release clause in the future, meaning Barcelona would have to pay the market price for the Inter striker. 

Martinez scored 21 goals in 49 appearances for Conte's side last season, who finished one point behind Serie A winners Juventus before finishing as runners-up in the Europa League last month. 

He moved to Milan from Argentinian side Racing Club for a £20m fee in July 2018.
