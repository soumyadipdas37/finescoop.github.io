She's not shy when it comes to flaunting her sensational figure.

And on Thursday, Simone Holtznagel showed off her ample assets in a busty selfie while on-set at a racy beachside photo shoot.

The 27-year-old stunner struggled to contain her cleavage in a clay-coloured string bikini top as she posed for the photo.

She teamed her raunchy display with a wide-brimmed straw hat, that sat on her wavy blonde tresses which cascaded down her shoulders.

Simone's makeup was kept simple with a hint of pink on her pout and lashings of mascara. 

'Sun safe is sexy,' she wrote in the caption of her Instagram post.

The blonde beauty also shared a similar photo on her Instagram Story, showing off her many assets.
