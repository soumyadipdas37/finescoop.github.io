Jack P Shepherd's neighbour's house has been raided by a 'gang of five' people during an evening burglary.

The Coronation Street star, 32, lives in the street in Manchester's Northern Quarter with his girlfriend Hanni Treweek.

It is thought that the group managed to get into the home at around 7.30pm on Thursday with the neighbour climbing onto a roof to escape, reports The Sun.

Another neighbour said: 'It's terrifying. It has left everyone on edge. It's just not something that we are used to seeing around here.'

Police later confirmed to the publication that they were called and a man was taken to hospital with minor injuries.

They added: 'Unknown offenders attempted to gain entry to a property before leaving the scene. No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.'

MailOnline has contacted Jack's representatives for a comment as well as Greater Manchester Police.

Jack has been spending the coronavirus lockdown at his Manchester home with his girlfriend Hanni and her two Chihuahuas.  

Over the past few months the couple have been keeping their fans updates with their lives on Instagram.  

The actor gave updates from their sitting room as they passed the time with exercise classes, Lego building and TikTok videos.

Last week Coronation Street bosses were forced to reschedule production after a member of the cast tested positive for Covid-19 after being on set last week.

The long-running soap had to briefly shut down certain areas of the set for a deep clean, after the coronavirus positive actor had filmed scenes.

It has been reported that although certain areas were closed down it did not affect filming due to the soap's two-metre distancing rules.

A spokeswoman for the ITV soap said: 'We can confirm a member of the Coronation Street team has tested positive for coronavirus. The protocols we have in place for such an eventuality have been implemented and the individual is now self isolating at home. 

'Although we do not believe anyone has been within 2m of the individual, as a precaution, the production team who were working with the individual have been notified.

'In keeping with health and safety guidance, we have also undertaken an intensive clean of touch points in the cohort area where the individual was working and areas of the building they visited.'
