Instagram queen Tammy Hembrow, 26, and Matt Poole, 32, debuted their new relationship earlier this month. 

And the pair's romance appears to be heating up after the athlete left a telling comment on a post with her two children: Wolf, five, and Saskia, four.  

Tammy shared a series of two photos of herself with her youngsters in the front seat of her car on Tuesday, alongside the caption: 'Squadd.'

'I think you're the dominant one,' Matt, a lifesaver and Ironman said. 'I go along and I go along, and then when you push me too far, I snap, and you go, "Oh, too far".'

'Yeah, I would agree,' Tammy replied. 'I just think I'm quite a dominant person.' 

The pair, who met at an event in Bali, Indonesia last year, also revealed who was the first to say 'I love you'.

'We had a little fight over nothing, and then when he was trying to make up with me and apologise, he told me he loved me,' the fitness mogul said.   

Tammy went on to reveal that she told Matt those three words during their trip to the Whitsunday Islands this month.
