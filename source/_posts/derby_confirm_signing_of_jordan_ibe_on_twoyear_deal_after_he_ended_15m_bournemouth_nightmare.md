Derby County have confirmed the signing of free agent Jordan Ibe on a two-year deal.

The former Liverpool youngster underwent a medical at the Pride Park club on Monday after being released by Bournemouth at the end of last season.

Ibe - who impressed during a 24-game loan spell at Derby in the 2014/15 season- had a difficult four seasons on and off the pitch for the Cherries in which he scored just three Premier League goals.

But having failed to score for Bournemouth last season, he is now the latest addition to Phillip Cocu's Derby squad.

'Jordon is a player with a lot of potential and undoubted ability,' Cocu said on the signing.

'He has performed for several years in the Premier League and at 24 years of age he still has many years ahead of him in his career.

'We have been keen to strengthen our attacking options out wide for some time, while we believe Derby County is the right place for Jordon at this stage of his career.'
