Tottenham are hoping to help trial bringing supporters back into Premier League games by welcoming back some of their highest paying fans for their opening match of the season against Everton. 

Following lockdown from the coronavirus outbreak earlier in the year, the resumption of the Premier League in June saw all the remaining fixtures played behind closed doors.

However, clubs are keen to get supporters through the turnstiles as soon as possible again and according to the Telegraph Spurs hope to find out in the early part of next week whether they will be allowed to open up White Hart Lane to around 4,000 fans.

The plan would see supporters fill just under half of the the 9,000 capacity for corporate clients, which chairman Daniel Levy believes he can make safe in line with coronavirus restrictions including social distancing.

Despite the match taking place in just eight days time, it is still unclear how the supporters would be chosen or if fans who could not attend would be able to claim a refund if the project is given the green light and they cannot attend.

Levy's believes that by opening up White Hart Lane's corporate areas, it will be a lot easier to control than the majority of the 62,000 stadium and prove an ideal trial run for allowing fans back into grounds across the country.

However the move is still likely to anger season ticket holders of the north London club if the seats are not decided via a ballot involving them.

Having just built a new £1bn stadium, Spurs felt the pinch financially during the pandemic and hope that by at least attracting 4,000 supporters for the game they can pocket as much as £1.5million.

A seat in an executive box can cost £800 a match, with the cheapest hospitality seat thought to be around £250 without the dining experience.

Levy has also looked ahead on plans on reopening White Hart Lane with another test event, that will see half of the ground's capacity allow around 31,000 to attend one of their earlier top flight matches of the campaign.
