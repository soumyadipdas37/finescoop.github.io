Joe Jonas has been enjoying fatherhood since welcoming his first child over the summer with wife Sophie Turner. 

But the former child star managed to steal away for some social time, while fitting in some fitness on Tuesday.

He cut a sporty chic look in a printed t-shirt and shorts as he stepped out to play tennis with some friends in Los Angeles, leaving Sophie and daughter Willa at home.

The 31-year-old donned a black Prince Tennis t-shirt with an orange and turquoise print, which matched his colorful shirts.

He finished the look with a black face mask, a gold watch and a pair of black Nike trainers with an orange swoosh, while carrying a white and orange Babolat duffel backpack.

Joe and Sophie, 24, recently put their Manhattan condo on the market for $5.9million, because they simply don't use it enough, according to TMZ.

They appear to be enjoying their family time at home in Los Angeles, after welcoming Willa back in July.

A source told Us Weekly of their firstborn's name: 'Willa isn’t a family name and isn’t short for anything. [It] is a name they had picked out a while ago before the baby’s arrival.'

The celebrity couple tied the knot last May in Las Vegas, before having a second ceremony that June in Paris.

Their first pregnancy was announced earlier this year in February, as the Game of Thrones star was spotted showing off her baby bump. 

Another insider told ET in June: 'Joe and Sophie are excited to be new parents and have been enjoying the process of getting ready for their baby.

'Sophie and Joe have been trying to also stay active going on walks and hiking. The whole Jonas family is looking forward to showering the new addition with love. Sophie is due soon and can't wait to be a mom.'
