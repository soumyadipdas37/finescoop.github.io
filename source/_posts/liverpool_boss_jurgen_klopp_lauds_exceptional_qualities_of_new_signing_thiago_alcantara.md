Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has saluted new recruit Thiago Alcantara's 'exceptional' qualities, declaring the Spanish midfielder a perfect addition to the Premier League champions' squad ahead of his full debut against Arsenal.

The 29-year-old is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world and Klopp believes he has key attributes that set him out from others. 

He moved from European champions Bayern Munich for a £25million fee having won the last seven Bundesliga titles with the German giants and played in last month's Champions League final win over Paris Saint-Germain.

Thiago made an impressive 45-minute Premier League debut in the Reds' win over Chelsea

He made an impressive debut as a half-time substitute for injured captain Jordan Henderson last week, making more passes than every Chelsea player on his Premier League debut - despite only playing 45 minutes.

And ahead of the Anfield clash with Arsenal, Klopp highlighted the experienced midfielder's attributes, both on and off the pitch.

'Thiago is obviously a very good football player,' Klopp told Sky Sports.

'You saw it [against Chelsea]. Some things are natural for him that are not natural for other players, but we won the league and we won the Champions League without Thiago.

'He won it (Champions League) with Bayern, so obviously it is a good fit I would say, but we now have to get used to each other.' 

Thiago was rested for last week's Carabao Cup victory over Lincoln and sat out training in recent days meaning he will have a late fitness test on Monday for the Gunners clash. 

Whether he is fit to play or not Klopp added: 'There are very special things [he has that separates him from others] in world football. 

'His vision is exceptional, pair that with pretty good technical skills, and a nice passing ability and these kind of things, and you become a really interesting package. 

'On top of that as a guy, he couldn't be better. It's incredible, when you give him a ball, he is still a kid.

'And when you take the ball away he is a really mature and experienced football person, who is interested in a lot of things, tactics and all these kind of things. He wants to learn which is very important.'
