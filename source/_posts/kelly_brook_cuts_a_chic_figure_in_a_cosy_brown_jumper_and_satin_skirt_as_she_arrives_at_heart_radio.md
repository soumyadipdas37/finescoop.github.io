She never fails to turn heads when it comes to her sense of style.

And Kelly Brook cut a chic figure as she arrived to work at Heart radio in London's Global Studios on Thursday.

The presenter, 40, kept warm in a cosy brown roll neck jumper and a brown satin skirt as she cheerfully made her way down the street.

Adding a casual element to her autumnal outfit, Kelly donned a pair of white trainers.

While she accessorised her look with oversized black sunglasses and carried her essentials in a quilted black handbag. 

The TV personality kept her hairstyle simple, opting to swept her brunette tresses into a ponytail, while she added a minimal palette of make-up.

Kelly was clearly full of the joys of autumn as she flashed a warm smile before making her way inside.

Kelly's outing comes as she admitted she's 'not worried' about her 'weight creeping up'.

She also declared 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation', after revealing she shed a whopping two stone in March.

While she has been keeping busy by exercising at home, her diet consists of 'healthy, low-calorie meals' with sweet treats such as popcorn and homemade fruit lollies.

The brunette has been candid about her weight fluctuating, with the bombshell slimming down to a size 10-12 after going to a size 16.

On her current figure, she told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'
