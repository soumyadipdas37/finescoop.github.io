Nicole Kidman's character, Celeste Wright, was trapped in an abusive relationship in HBO drama series Big Little Lies.

And on Sunday's episode of Australian 60 Minutes, country music star Keith Urban admitted it was 'very heavy' to watch his wife portray domestic violence scenes.

The 52-year-old said he had to remind himself that she was 'just acting'. 

'I had to remind myself she's just acting': Keith Urban, 52, admitted on Sunday's episode of Australian 60 Minutes (pictured), that 'it was very heavy' to watch wife Nicole Kidman's domestic violence scenes on HBO drama series Big Little Lies 

When asked how he felt watching Nicole, 53, in confronting domestic violence scenes, Keith replied: 'It's hard to tell your soul that she's an actor and she's acting.

'My soul is just alerted to this fear. [I have to tell myself] "It's okay, mate, It's okay. She's just acting. Just calm down, she's just acting",' he continued.

'It was very heavy to watch, because she's so bloody good [at acting].'   

Season one and two of Big Little Lies explored the complex and disturbing marriage between Celeste and Perry Wright, played by Alexander Skarsgård.

Keith continued: 'It was very heavy to watch, because she's so bloody good [at acting]' 

Episodes showed the wealthy couple passionately locked in sexual intercourse.

But their intense passion was underscored by terrifying scenes of emotional and physical abuse.  

In an effort to salvage their marriage following one of Perry's violent outbursts in season one, the couple went to a therapist for help. 

Perry partially acknowledged beating his wife to the counsellor, before Celeste admitted in a private session that the abuse turned her on, in its own twisted way.

In an interview with Vanity Fair in March 2017, Alexander said the two actors made sure to 'reconnect' as friends after filming confronting scenes.    

'It was very important to reconnect after shooting those scenes,' the 44-year-old said. 'We made a point of checking in with each other, giving each other a hug.'

'Nicole is an incredible partner because she is so generous and so open, and it makes it easier as an actor when you have a partner like that,' he added.
