Kim Kardashian West, her sister Khloé, and pseudo brother-in-law Scott Disick filmed Keeping Up with the Kardashians in Malibu on Friday - three days after announcing the show will end next year.

The E! Network cameras rolled as the privileged trio shot scenes for the 20th season - premiering 'early next year' - by strolling on the shoreline together.

But it was hardly an ideal beach day for the Kardashian clan what with the smoke-filled clouds from the devastation of the Western wildfires blotting out the sun.

And while Kim, Khloé, and Scott did not wear government-mandated masks or face coverings - all of the crew members protected themselves and others from the coronavirus on the sandy set.

As of Saturday, there have been over 252K confirmed COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 6,177 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University. 

Apparently, the 36-year-old Good American co-founder and the 37-year-old Talentless CEO are 'the only people who are upset' about the reality series concluding. 

'Khloé has tried to launch several spin-off shows - but none of them have been as successful as KUWTK,' an insider told The Sun.

Action! And while Kim, Khloé, and Scott did not wear government-mandated masks or face coverings - all of the crew members protected themselves and others from the coronavirus on the sandy set

'And who knows how Scott will make money now that the show is being canceled - he loves flying in private jets and being treated like an A-list star. I can't see him flying commercial or paying his own way.'

But ultimately, it was the 39-year-old SKIMS CEO's decision to 'take a break' due to all the drama surrounding her third husband, Kanye West, making a doomed 2020 presidential bid. 

That same day, West showed off her new calf-length sculpting leggings featuring a 'pee hole,' which were underneath her white maxi-skirt for the shoot.

Add to that, Kim and Khloe's older sister Kourtney decision to step back in March as well as their younger half sisters Kendall & Kylie Jenner 'no longer needing the show' for their careers.

KUWTK originally premiered in October 2007 - eight months after Kim's 2002 sex tape was leaked and bought for $1M by Vivid Entertainment.

But first, fans can catch the 19th 'lockdown' season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians when it premieres next Thursday on E!
