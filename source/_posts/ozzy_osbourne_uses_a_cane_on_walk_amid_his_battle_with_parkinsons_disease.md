He was seen in the end of August for the first time in months looking completely unrecognisable as he deals with his health woes.

And Ozzy Osbourne was seen out and about once again on Monday as he stepped out for a stroll in Santa Barbara, California, amid his Parkinson's battle.

The Black Sabbath frontman, 71, looked frail as he walked towards his car with his head down while holding a cane.

Ozzy kept things casual for the outing as he paired a black t-shirt with grey shorts, while he shielded his eyes with one of his signature pair of shades.

The Prince Of Darkness is know for his long mane of dark brown hair, but -as seen in the end of August- he's currently grey-haired and tied his hair back in a ponytail. 

Ozzy went public this January with his Parkinson's battle, after being diagnosed with the disease in February 2019.

He announced in February that he was canceling the North American leg of his No More Tours II concert gigs, owing to an excruciating neck injury. 

What's more, he suffered a fall last year and required spinal surgery, ultimately scrapping his tour dates for 2019. 

Ozzy was meant to hit the road again this year, but scrapped the North American leg of his tour so that he could seek treatment in Switzerland - only for the coronavirus lockdowns to leave him confined to his home and unable to travel to Europe. 

Although Ozzy has not been seen out in public in months, he did appear with his family on Celebrity Watch Party with a finale that aired July 23rd.

The reality show is a take-off of the UK show Gogglebox and offers a glimpse at celebrities in their homes watching and reacting to TV. 

Prior to that, he was seen in January, looking a little more like his old self, when he attended the Grammys with a walking cane alongside his daughter Kelly.

Despite his recent health crises and reduced mobility, the father-of-six and former reality star has repeatedly declared that he will never abandon showbusiness or rock and roll. 

'You know the time when I will retire? When I can hear them nail a lid on my box. And then I’ll f***ing do an encore. I’m the Prince of Darkness,' he said this week.
