Serena Williams reached the US Open quarter-finals once again with a three-set victory over Maria Sakkari on Monday.

The American number 3 seed, who is chasing her coveted 24th Grand Slam title of her career, took the first set 6-3 at Flushing Meadows against the tough 15th seed from Greece. 

Sakkari improved after that setback and levelled the match via a tiebreak despite spurning two set point opportunities earlier in the set.
