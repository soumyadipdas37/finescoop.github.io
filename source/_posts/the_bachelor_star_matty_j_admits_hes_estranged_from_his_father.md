The Bachelor star Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson has offered a glimpse into his family life from his parents' divorce to his estrangement from his father.

The 33-year-old candidly admitted that he hasn't spoken to his dad for 'a number of years' but has always been close to his mother Ellie who raised five children by herself following her divorce when he was 12.

Now a father himself to one-year-old daughter, Marlie-Mae - who he shares with fiancée Laura Byrne - Matt told The Sunday Morning Herald he fully understands his mother's struggles and also gushed about his joy at being a stay-at-home dad.

'I've been able to be the stay-at-home dad and get to know my daughter. It's been quite amazing,' he told the publication.

The doting parent also spoke about his own upbringing, saying: 'My parents divorced when I was 12. Mum raised five children on her own and worked full-time. Only now that I'm a parent can I understand how difficult that must have been.

His parental instinct is so strong that Matt admitted he gets a 'knot in his stomach' whenever he leaves Marlie-Mae's room after checking in on her every night.

'I feel very emotional as a dad. I was always that guy who noticed other dads in the park playing with their kids long before I had my own child.'

Matty and Laura became engaged with Matty J in April 2019. 

The pair first met on season five of The Bachelor in 2017, and welcomed their daughter Marlie-May in June last year.

Speaking on the So Dramatic podcast, Matty recently clarified a common question he gets asked, which is if the Bachelor gets to choose which girls he dates and who goes home.

'That decision is entirely at the hands of The Bachelor. You get to pick exactly which girls you go on dates with, and who stays and who goes home.

'Even the order of the rose ceremony. It is up to you. He decides everything, it's all up to him.'
