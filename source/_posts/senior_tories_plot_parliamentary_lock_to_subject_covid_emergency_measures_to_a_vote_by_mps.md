Senior Tories are planning a parliamentary lock to prevent Boris Johnson having the final say on new lockdown measures, according to The Sunday Telegraph. 

Altrincham and Sale West MP Sir Graham Brady is planning to table an amendment that would force ministers to put any new measures to a vote first.

MPs will vote next week on reauthorising the government's use of such emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act 2020.

Sir Graham Brady (centre) is looking to force a vote by MPs on emergency coronavirus measures amid concerns that restrictions on the public's freedom are being imposed without parliamentary scrutiny. Senior Tory MPs are said to be angry that they are not able to debate new measures, such as the Rule of Six and £1000 fines for flouting self-isolation, which takes effect next week. Brady said there was 'no justification for ministers ruling by emergency powers without reference to normal democratic processes' now parliament is in session (file photo).

A Downing Street spokesman told The Telegraph: 'It's absolutely vital that MPs are engaged in this process as these decisions will have a huge impact on them and their constituents and we will continue to discuss these plans with all MPs.'

But some senior Tory MPs are angry about new restrictions on the public's freedom, such as the Rule of Six, being introduced without a debate in the Commons.

Drinkers are seen out on the town in Nottingham on Saturday. Fears of a second wave of coronavirus have prompted Boris Johnson to institute harsh new rules to limit the virus' spread. But some in his party are displeased with changes that they feel unfairly restrict the freedom of their constituents.

Fines of up to £1000 for breaching self-isolation were also approved without parliamentary scrutiny.

Sir Brady, who is chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said that parliament has been sitting since April.

'There is now no justification for ministers ruling by emergency powers without reference to normal democratic processes.'
