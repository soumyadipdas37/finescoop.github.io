Last month, she revealed that she wants to go into acting – setting her sights on a role in London's West End.

And Ellie Goulding showed she can command an audience's attention with a simple selfie on Tuesday, when she shared a glam shot of herself on Instagram.

The Love Me Like You Do hitmaker, 33, looked sensational as she pouted for the camera in the snap, which showed her wearing a makeup palette of soft pink hues.

With her flaxen locks styled in lustrous shoulder-length waves, the star donned a plain white top as she angles the camera lens to get the best shot.

The chart-topping star kept her caption short and sweet, as she simple wrote: 'Hiya.'

Last month, the Starry-Eyed hitmaker expressed an interest in reinventing her career during an interview with The Sun, as she reflected on how much she'd enjoyed acting as a youngster.

New venture: Last month, the star revealed she wants to go into acting and take on a role in the West End as she said she'd 'like to see if she's still got it' after first performing as a child

She explained: 'I acted a lot when I was young and I really enjoyed it. I loved playing different characters.'

'It's probably a very different kind of confidence from being on stage. But I'd like to see if I've still got it.

'I would probably be in a play. I've seen a lot of plays in the last couple of years in London and I'd like to start there.'

Ellie added that she didn't feel a blockbuster would be the right choice for her to start with, despite singers like Rita Ora and Rihanna already venturing into that territory successfully.

Also last month, Ellie – who is married to art dealer Caspar Jopling – said she feels 'overlooked' by the fashion industry because she has an athletic figure.

The singer took to her Instagram Stories to admit that she feels her appearance has been criticised by both men and women.

She said that she feels her muscular physique 'challenges femininity' and the way that people are 'supposed to look' in her industry.

Fashion: Also last month, Ellie – who is married to art dealer Caspar Jopling – said she feels 'overlooked' by the fashion industry because she has an athletic figure 

Ellie wrote: 'Re my last post - I've definitely been criticised by men and women for my athleticism and appearance because it challenges femininity and how I'm 'supposed to look' in this industry.

'I honestly feel I have been overlooked in the fashion world for this reason but I will keep pushing female strength as the ultimate super power. Which it is.' 

It came after Ellie proclaimed her gym routine to be her 'ultimate escape' as she shared a snap of her washboard abs.    

She is known for her love of fitness and told how working out has helped her mental health, although she has found it difficult to stay motivated during lockdown.
