Yazmin Oukhellou has lifted the lid on her reunion with on/off boyfriend James Lock during an exclusive clip ahead of the new series of The Only Way Is Essex.

The TOWIE star, 26, spoke to Bobby Norris and Nicole Bass about how she ditched her gal pal Amber Turner while on holiday to enjoy a romantic reunion with her then ex James.

Bobby quizzed Yazmin on their relationship and told her he'd heard 'through the grapevine' she had left Amber at a beach club and jetted off to meet James.

Confronting Yaz over the situation, he said: 'What I've heard through the Essex grape vine is that you skanked Amber at a beach club and jetted off to Mallorca to meet Lockie.' 

Attempting to explain herself, she retorted: 'So I was on my first girls' holiday ever with Amber in Ibiza and I think that kind of, not worried James a little bit...

'But he thought god she's moving on with her life and he was messaging me every day like come out here, so I took the first flight out to Mallorca.

Appearing happy with herself, she told Bobby: 'And I've got to say it was the best decision I've ever made.'

Although the TOWIE gang have been separated due to lockdown, their is still drama brewing in Brentwood, as Amber tries to get to the bottom of Lockie's intentions with Yaz now they are back together.

Elsewhere on the show, original cast member Amy Childs is set to make her grand return, however it seems there is an issue between her and Bobby Norris.

Cya! 'But he thought god she's moving on with her life and he was messaging me every day like come out here, so I took the first flight out to Mallorca'

Chloe Sims also reveals that she has fallen out with her best pal Pete Wicks, however it is yet to be revealed why.

The couple confirmed they're very much an item once again, when they were spotted kissing and holding hands while shooting scenes for their hit show in South Woodford, east London, last month.

A week earlier, they were seen putting on a cosy display during filming for their show, hugging and giggling as they attended a food festival in Chelmsford, Essex.

Days before that, Yazmin and James did little to dispel rumours they had rekindled their relationship as they enjoyed dinner together at Sexy Fish in London's Mayfair.

Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted last month, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.

They looked as loved up as ever, showing signs they were on the road to returning to a fully fledged romance, with a source saying 'sparks are flying' between them.

A source told The Sunt: 'They're not officially back together but they're getting closer and everyone around them wouldn't be surprised if they got back together.

'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'

Yazmin and James sensationally split last summer after rumours of cheating on his part - which he vehemently denied.

The couple displayed their turbulent relationship on TOWIE during their two years of being together.
