The grieving widow of slain bikie Mick Hawi is in disbelief after two men were cleared of her husband's murder. 

The former bikie boss was gunned down while sitting in his black Mercedes outside a Fitness First gym in Sydney's south on February 15, 2018.  

Yusuf Guney Nazlioglu, 39, and Jamal Eljaidi, 32, were both found not guilty of murder after a three-and-a-half week trial at the NSW Supreme Court ended last week.

Hawi's wife Carolina Gonzalez says she is devastated by the outcome. 

'It's destroyed us, they have destroyed everyone and they don't care,' she told Nine News.

'I was in disbelief and frustrated - where's the justice? There were a lot of things that should have been put into evidence and it wasn't.'

Meanwhile shocking new footage has emerged of the bikie kingpin's final moments before his execution style murder.

CCTV captures the moment Hawi casually walks past the reception of the Sydney gym just seconds before his assassination.

He then hops into his Mercedes before another car pulls up and a gunman runs towards his car and pulls the trigger.

While Nazlioglu, 39, and Eljaidi were cleared, removalist Ahmad Doudar, 40, was jailed on Thursday for disposing of the getaway car.

Doudar's role in the crime involved him picking up a hidden silver Aurion with a tow truck and intending to dispose of it, alongside others, the court heard.

Justice Robert Allan Hulme said on sentencing today: '(Mr Doudar) intended to assist in disposing of the vehicle in order to assist' in the murder. 

In handing down his sentence Justice Robert Allan Hulme said Doudar's plea of guilty and the facts he had agreed to indicated he knew 'the brazen and brutal executioner.'

'The murder itself was horrifying. It was a dangerous and violent public execution. Mr Doudar knew this.'

The judge said murders like this 'do not happen by chance... they require the involvement of multiple people.'

Doudar's motive remains unknown. 'For all I know, Mr Doudar may have been motivated by one or more other purposes,' the judge said.

Hawi's wife, Carolina Gonzalez, sister Zeinab and parents Ahmad and Nahdi read statements at his sentencing hearing.

They gave 'very moving accounts of the loss and grief that has resulted from the taking of their loved one in the most horrendous of circumstances.'

Doudar was jailed with a non parole period of three years and four months. With time served, he will be eligible for parole at the end of 2021.
