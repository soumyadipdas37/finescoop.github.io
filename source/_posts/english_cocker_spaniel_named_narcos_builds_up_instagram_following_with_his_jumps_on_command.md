An English cocker spaniel has built an Instagram following of more than 100,000 with his hilarious jumps at home, at the beach, and in front of tourist hotspots.

The three-year-old dog, named Narcos, lives in Paris with his French owner Euphemie Brindejonc. 

In one snap, his hair forms to make him look like Elvis Presley, while in others, he is seen jumping energetically in front of the Eiffel Tower and Sacré-Cœur in Paris. 

Euphemie said Narcos only jumps when she utters the word 'hopa' and offers a treat.

She said: 'I hold the camera in one hand and in the other one I have a treat, I say hopa and he jumps. 

'Narcos started jumping on his own when he was one and a half years old.

'Mostly at the beach or during game time to catch the ball or stick I was holding.

'One day I thought it would be nice to take pictures of him while he was jumping. 

'We had to find a way for him to jump while looking at the camera and I started taking pictures on the bed to get perspective and so he wouldn't jump on me.'

Narcos has now perfected his trick to the extent that he knows he must only jump on the spot, Euphemie said.     

'Now I don't need a bed anymore, he knows he has to jump on the spot and not towards me.

'If the picture is missed, it can only be my fault.'

Despite his love of jumping, Euphemie said he doesn't spend days doing it for pictures, its just now and then. 

She said: 'In public people often stop to pet Narcos. 

'He is always happy to meet new people but also new dogs.

'Seeing a person take a picture of their dog in Paris makes a lot of people smile, so when they jump with all their hair it's even more fun. 

'When I take a picture of Narcos at the Trocadéro for example, it is no longer the Eiffel Tower that tourists are looking at but my dog.

'The reaction of our followers was great, they liked it a lot from the first photos. Many people have started following Narcos following the first photos of him jumping. 

'He's a very happy dog, his tail wags all the time and he follows me everywhere except in the bathroom. He loves to be photographed.'
