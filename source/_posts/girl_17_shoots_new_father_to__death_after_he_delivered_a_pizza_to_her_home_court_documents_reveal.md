A 17-year-old girl shot a new father to his death after he delivered a pizza to an abandoned house she ordered it to, court documents reveal. 

Jaelynn Billups tried to rob Joshua Ungersma, 37, while he delivered the pizza but shot him when he asked someone to call police in Lafayette, Indiana, witnesses alleged.

Police found Mr Ungersma dead on North 16th Street on August 31 after there were reports of 'shots fired' at around 11.15pm.

They also found the body of Billups's boyfriend Alberto Vanmeter, 19, nearby with a Domino's pizza box, two drinks and cash laying on the ground beside him.

Mr Ungersma told witness Patrick Gibson that couple Vanmeter and Billups had tried to rob him before Billups shot him, according to court documents.

Another witness also alleged Mr Ungesma had asked someone to call police before Billups shot him.

Police said Billups was standing over one of the victims when they arrived and she had phoned the cops with the same phone she ordered the pizza on, reported WISHTV.

Police said Domino's Pizza delivery driver Mr Ungersma was found with 'a .38 S&W revolver in his pocket with the rounds fired'. He had a permit to carry the weapon.

When police ordered Billups to show her hands, she threw a 9mm handgun onto the sidewalk and was detained, reported WTHR.

A coroner determined Mr Ungersma died of multiple gunshot wounds while Vanmeter died of a single gunshot wound. 

Jaelynn Billups, 17, was charged in Tippecanoe Superior Court 2 with killing Joshua Ungersma and is being held without bond.

In a second murder count, she was also charged with causing Mr Ungersma to kill Alberto Vanmeter, 19.

She was also charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery, armed robbery, theft, pointing a firearm, and carrying a handgun without a license. 

Billups told the judge during an initial hearing September 8 that her family was planning on hiring an attorney. Her trial date was set for February 23, 2021.

Mr Ungersma worked a second job at a Domino's store on Greenbush Street in Lafayette, which is donating 75 per cent of sales through Friday to his family. 

The owners hope to raise around $15,000 for the Ungersma family to support his newborn baby.

Domino's store owner Jimmy Ruedlinger said: 'We want to be able to do whatever we can for the family.

'They're going through a lot right now, obviously, with the loss of their father, the husband, a son in the mom's case. 

'We're a family here, and we're a team, and we're going to take care of whatever we can take care of at this point.'

Mr Ungersma leaves behind a wife, stepchild, and his six-month-old son Sebastian.

Friend Jamie Wilkins who organised a fundraised for his funeral said: 'The memorial services have been both heartbreaking and healing. 

'It was so wonderful to hear everyone's memories of Josh through this fundraiser and at the service. 

'Josh's life definitely made such a great impact on so many lives. They say the good die young... it hits so close to home. 

'Josh has now been laid to rest and will forever watch over those he loves.'
