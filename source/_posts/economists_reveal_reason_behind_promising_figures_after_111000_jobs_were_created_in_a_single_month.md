Economists have revealed the reason behind Australia's unemployment dropped dramatically after 111,000 jobs were created in a single month.  

The jobless rate fell from a 22-year high of 7.5 per cent in July to 6.8 per cent in August, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed on Thursday.

The number of employed persons sharply ­exceeded market expectations of a 35,000 fall.

However the number what the figures don't reflect is how many workers are employed in the gig economy.  

Deutsche Bank economist Phil O'Donaghoe said it was these workers, or 'non-employees' - those who manage enterprises without employees - which caused last month's spike.

These could include delivery drivers and riders of major online deliver services, who are not directly employed by the respective delivery company.

'They are, in effect, 'self-employed' contractors, and would be classified as such by the ABS,' Mr O'Donaghoe said.

He added the trouble with the gig economy was 'the disconnect between employment and hours worked', The Australian reported

'Despite a 111k rise in employment, hours worked rose just 0.1 per cent month on month,'  Mr O'Donaghoe said.

'So: a surge in employment, but not via employees in a typical business structure, and it is fair to infer that many of those new workers hardly worked for many hours (given the paltry rise in overall hours worked). That leaves us describing this as a poor employment print, despite the headline.'

His comments were echoed by Grattan Institute's chief executive, Danielle Wood.

'Buried amongst the surprisingly good jobs figures today ... almost all the increase in employment was for the self-employed,' she said on Twitter.

'Big rise in the gig economy is my guess.'

The ABS defines payroll jobs as being 'employee jobs' for which a payment was reported to the Australian Taxation Office through Single Touch Payroll.

These include the jobs held by employees and owner managers of incorporated enterprises.

'Owner managers of unincorporated enterprises, the largest component of the employment growth in August, are not covered by payroll jobs measures,' the ABS stated on its website. 

'There is also lower coverage of small businesses (<20 employees) in the payroll jobs data than large and medium businesses. 

'As a result, the increase in owner managers of incorporated enterprises without employees is also less likely to be reflected in the payroll jobs series.'

Citi economists Josh Williamson and Faraz Syed told ABC that the August data showed 'jobs growth remained solid mid-way through the third quarter' and official forecasts for unemployment rates were 'too pessimistic.'  

Unemployment is still, however, higher than March's 5.2 per cent level - compiled before the World Health Organisation declared a coronavirus pandemic.      

Nonetheless, joblessness has fallen for the first time since February when the Australian share market peaked despite Melbourne recording the first case of COVID-19 in January.

Unemployment rate fell from a 22-year high of 7.5 per cent in July to 6.8 per cent in August

Participation rate rose from 64.7 per cent to 64.8 per cent 

Number employed rose by 111,000 to 12,583,400

Jobless ranks fell by 86,500 with women making up 55,000 or 64 per cent of those 



The number of Australians officially without work rose above the one million mark in July for the first time ever but in August, the ranks of the unemployed fell by 86,500 to 921,800 people.

Almost two-thirds, or 55,000 of those were women.

National unemployment also fell in August despite Melbourne, Australia's second biggest city, being placed into a strict, Stage Four lockdown with an 8pm to 5am curfew.

Victoria's unemployment rate of 7.1 per cent was above the national average, as the number of people employed fell by 42,400 as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions. 

New South Wales had the lowest unemployment rate of 6.7 per cent.

Tasmania, however, had the lowest unemployment rate among all the states of 6.3 per cent with only the Northern Territory (4.2 per cent) and the Australian Capital Territory (4.2 per cent) having lower jobless figures. 

Queensland's jobless figure declined from 8.8 per cent to 7.5 per cent.

Western Australia's equivalent jobless rate dropped from 8.3 per cent to seven per cent.

South Australia's unemployment level remained at 7.9 per cent. 

Australia's youth unemployment also fell from 16.3 per cent to 14.3 per cent.
