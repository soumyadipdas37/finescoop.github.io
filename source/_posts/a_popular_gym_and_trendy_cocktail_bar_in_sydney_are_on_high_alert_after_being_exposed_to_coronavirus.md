A inner-city bar and an up-market fitness centre in Sydney have been placed on high alert after two people with confirmed cases of COVID-19 visited the venues. 

People who attended Kuleto's Cocktail Bar in the trendy suburb of Newtown and Bondi Platinum Fitness First in Bondi Junction shopping centre have been warned to be alert for symptoms of the virus. 

The warning follows New South Wales Health announcing eight new coronavirus cases on Friday, with new cases linked to a cluster in the Sydney CBD.

The trendy Newtown cocktail bar Kuleto's (pictured) has also had a confirmed case of coronavirus attend the establishment 

Patrons who attended the cocktail bar at 157 King Street on Friday August 28 between 6.30pm and 9.30pm for at least one hour must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days since that date. 

While gymgoers at the Fitness First, located on level 6 of the shopping centre, on Monday August 31 between 7am and 5pm are being advised to watch for symptoms and if immediately self-isolate and get tested if any develop. 

NSW Health advises those isolating should continue to quarantine for the entire 14-days even if they return a negative test result.  

Another Fitness First in the city is also being assessed by the agency for possible exposure to COVID-19. 

People who attended Randwick Fitness First from Sunday, August 23, to Tuesday, September 1, should be alert and get tested for COVID-19 if they have even the slightest symptoms and isolate until results are available. 

Those who were there on Sunday, August 30, between 10am and 2pm, the following day between 11am and 4pm, and on Tuesday, September 1, between 8am and noon will be contacted by the agency. 

The warning follows New South Wales Health announcing eight new coronavirus cases on Friday, with new cases linked to a cluster in the Sydney CBD (pictured on September 4) 

Seven cases were linked to known coronavirus clusters in Sydney and one was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine. Bunnings Padstow (pictured) has been put on alert after an infectious customer visited the store between 12pm and 2pm on August 27 

They will receive further information about whether they are casual or close contacts of a coronavirus case. 

Of the eight new cases in NSW on Friday, one new case was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine and the other seven locally acquired cases that have been linked to a known source. 

Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr Jeremy McAnulty confirmed three of the new cases were linked to a cluster in Sydney's CBD.  

Bunnings and Aldi have been also put on high alert after an infectious customer visited the stores in western Sydney. 

Two new cases were close contacts linked to the Liverpool Hospital cluster and two were linked to St Paul's Catholic College in Greystanes.

People wait in line at a COVID-19 testing clinic in the city centre as the state of New South Wales continues to report relatively low numbers for new daily cases, in Sydney, Australia, September 4, 2020 

Two previously announced cases were linked to the CBD outbreak, originating with the City Tattersalls gym, and brought the total number of cases in the cluster to 57.   

The state previously saw days of double digit coronavirus numbers with New South Wales reporting 12 new cases on Thursday.  

Regents Park Christian School, in western Sydney, is closed for cleaning, with anyone who attended after-school care on August 31 or September 1 considered a close contact.    

A virus alert was also sent out for Aldi in North Strathfield after a positive coronavirus case visited the store between 10am and 10.30am on September 1.  

Bunnings in Padstow has also been placed on alert after an infectious person visited between noon and 2pm on August 27. 

New South Wales has recorded a total of 3,910 coronavirus cases. 

At least 23,168 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. 

NSW Health are currently treating 87 people for coronavirus and 85 per cent of these cases are treated out of hospital. 

Seven people are being treated in intensive care and four are on ventilators. 

'Community transmission of COVID continues in New South Wales and maintaining high rates of testing is vital,' Dr McAnulty said.

'Anyone with the mildest of symptoms such as a scratchy throat or runny nose should get tested immediately and isolate until they receive a negative result.'
