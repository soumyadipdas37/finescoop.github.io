The star's swimsuits have a celebrity following with Lindsey Vonn and Chrissy Teigen showing them off in recent weeks.  

Releasing the line is something of a dream come true for Devon, who has wanted to launch a collection ever since getting started in modelling. 

'Since I began in the modelling industry, my end goal was to always build my brand and start my own line!' she told Forbes.

'It wasn't until years later that I realised my love for resort wear, and at the same time noticed a gap in the market for swim that has more design detail and that is more elevated than just your average triangle bikini.'

She added: 'I'm also not limiting myself at just swim — sooner than later, I will be offering some affordable RTW!' 

The 5ft 11in beauty wed Johnny Barbara - co-owner of fashion label Alexis - at St Bartholomew's Anglican Church on the Caribbean island of St Barths on November 16 2019.
