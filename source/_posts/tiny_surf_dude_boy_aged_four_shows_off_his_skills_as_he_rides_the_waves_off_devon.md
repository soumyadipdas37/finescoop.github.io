Surfing prodigy, Nate Clark, from Devon has been wowing crowds with his ability to surf standing up - at the age of just four.

The young boy has been riding on his dad Lee's board since he was two but started surfing on his own a year ago.

 Nate has proved such a natural out on the water, he can already 'hang ten' - a tricky surfing maneuver where the surfer curls their toes over the edge of the board - and ride waves with the best of them.

Nate Clark, age four, from Westward Ho!, a seaside village in Devon, can already stand up on the surfboard and ride the waves with ease

He honed his skills during lockdown with regular trips into the sea at his local beach.

And his parents Katie and Lee Clark say all eyes are on him while he surfs with on-lookers staggered by the skills that defy his tiny frame and tender age.

Katie, 39, of Westward Ho!, a seaside village in Devon, said: 'We have always taken him in the sea and he was always familiar with it, but when he was about two he would go on his dad's board.

'Nate's sister Gracie then got a surfboard and he took inspiration from her. He basically nicked her board and started himself. 

'He has got really good this year. During lockdown he practiced a lot.

'He is a natural and has taken to it really well. You can see by his face he absolutely loves it.

Nate needs help from his dad Lee to paddle out because of the size of the surfboard, but when he spots a wave he can take it on himself

'He takes every opportunity to go into the water. He is a little way off being able to do tricks, but he can surf a wave standing up and balance on the board.

'We are so proud of him and just happy to see him doing something he loves.

'People are amazed when they see him. He looks so tiny on the board and all eyes are on him when he is surfing.'

Katie says he needs help from his dad to paddle out due to the size of the board, but he then spots a wave and goes for it.

She says Nate tells his dad: 'I want to go for that bad boy.'

Katie said he was just enjoying it as a hobby for now, but if he continues to progress they will look at entering him in competitions.

She added: 'There are local competitions set up for younger children so if he sticks to it we'll start by entering him for that. 

'He thinks it is great and just says 'I love surfing' all the time.

'We are only five mins from the beach so he is in a perfect place to hone his talents.'

Katie said her husband Lee Clark, 37, a carpenter, has been a surfer for around 15 years and their daughter Gracie, ten, also enjoys it.
