Not born with perfectly lush brows? No problem. Shoppers swear by the Eylure Dybrow Permanent Tint For Brows for dark glossy brows, so much so that one kit sells every 30 seconds in the UK.

Even better? The cult classic at-home beauty treatment is now under £7 on Amazon.

It doesn't matter whether you have thin, sparse arches or thick, bushy brows, the brand's bestselling brow tint, which now costs £6.95, uses permanent dye to enhance and add definition, giving the illusion of thicker, fuller brows.

Eylure Dybrow is a hit with beauty lovers with one kit selling every 30 seconds in the UK

This kit will save you money (as you can pay anything up to £25 for an in-salon brow tint), won't cost you much work, and it streamlines your morning makeup routine.

In short, Eylure Dybrow is an easy way to give your brows an instant at-home refresh, and all it takes is 15 minutes.

'So much easier to use than thought it would be!' one reviewer wrote. 'Great results in nine mins, even covered my stray white hairs. Remains to see how long it lasts, but I was going to the salon every six weeks and spending £15 each time, so it's already a saving!'

Another agreed adding: 'The product exceeded my expectations - never thought I'd be able to achieve salon results at home.'

Not only has over 6,000 shoppers giving Eylure Dybrow a five-star rating, but it's also one of my favourite beauty products – I've been using it since 2015.

Eylure Dybrow tints every last tiny baby hair instantly making my brows look thicker than before. It's affordable and gets the job done. And if you like to tweeze your eyebrows, I advise dying them first as the shape of your brow is more defined after the treatment, so you're less likely to over pluck.

But what does at-home eyebrow tinting involve? Before you go ahead and mix the dye cream and activating solution together, Sara Sordillo, makeup artist for Eylure recommends applying Vaseline around your brow area to avoid staining your skin.

Next, brush the mixed tint through the brows ensuring the hair is completely covered.

'Brush up, down and left to right to ensure each hair is coated,' Sara recommends. 'Start your timer as soon as the first brow is coated. This way you will get a more even result as you will remove tint off the first brow which will account for the time difference.'

Once the dye is applied, it takes just a few minutes to develop before you remove it to reveal freshly darkened eyebrows

Once the dye is applied, it takes just a few minutes to develop before you remove it to reveal freshly darkened eyebrows.

She added: 'If you have lighter hair colour and lighter brows and want to keep the colour more natural, shorten the time the tint is on the brows as you can always repeat the steps again to darken but not to lighten.'

Remember to carry out a patch test at least 48 hours before dyeing your eyebrows.

For best results and a natural finish, I recommend applying the dye to the tail of the eyebrow first, working your way through the arch to the front.
