Luis Suarez scored fifteen minutes into his Atletico Madrid debut after coming on as a second-half substritute in the 5-1 thrashing of Granada. 

Diego Costa, Angel Correa, Joao Felix and Marcus Llorente goals had given the hosts an unassailable lead before Suarez came off the bench on 70 minutes. 

The Uruguayan, who completed a £5.5million move from Barcelona this week, headed in from six yards to make it five for Diego Simeone's side, two minutes before Jorge Molina netted a late consolation.
