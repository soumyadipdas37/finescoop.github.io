A police hunt is underway for a group of highway bandits after a sleeping truck driver was dragged from his vehicle and shot twice in the leg then robbed. 

Emergency services were called to the Great Western Highway at Mount Lambie, 160km northwest of Sydney, about 5am on Tuesday following reports a truck driver had been shot.

The 42-year-old man, from Western Australia, was treated at the scene for injuries to his right upper thigh and right foot. 

He was rushed to Lithgow hospital then airlifted to Westmead hospital, where he underwent surgery. He remains in a stable condition.

'The injuries this man sustained from the assault and the shooting were significant and given the location he was left in, he is lucky to be alive,' Superintendent Robert Critchlow said.

The man told police he was sleeping in his vehicle when a group of men broke into the cabin, assaulted him, dragged him outside then shot him twice.   

The attackers then stole personal items from the truck, before fleeing the area in other vehicles.

Detectives from the State Crime Command’s Criminal Groups Squad are investigating the assault under Strike Force Hathern. 

The vehicle and a number of items have been seized to undergo forensic examination.

Investigations continue.
