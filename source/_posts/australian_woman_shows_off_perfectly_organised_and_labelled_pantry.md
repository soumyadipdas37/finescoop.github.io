An Australian mum has amazed hundreds of others online after sharing images of her perfectly organised pantry.

Posting to the Mums Who Organise Facebook group, Bernadette said she only recently organised her pantry using multiple storage containers and jars.

The containers seem to be arranged in rows based on categories, such as sugar, flour, herbs and spices.

Posting to the Mums Who Organise Facebook group, Bernadette said she only recently organised her pantry using multiple storage containers and jars. The containers seem to be organised in rows based on categories

'Containers, jars, stands and baskets are from an Asian Grocery Store in the Brimbank Plaza in Melbourne's West,' she said online.

'Labels and stickers are custom made by Invites & Designs by Cass.'

At the bottom of the doorless pantry are oils, sauces and condiments neatly placed in rows or put in baskets.

The open pantry sits opposite the fridge in the kitchen and the organised style makes it easier to see how much food is remaining.  

Hundreds of social media users were impressed with the effort and neat style, though some wondering how Bernadette keeps track of the food expiry dates.

'You can purchase little stickers to put on the back of the containers and write the expiry date on it, with a white board marker - but trust me, with a growing family I'm always topping up goods!' she said.

Others shared words of praise and tagged friends in the comments section of the Facebook post.

'Pantry goals!! My kitchen cabinets come next week and this is how I want mine to look. Thanks for the inspo!' one woman said.

'Wow, that is all I can say, wow,' another said, a third added: 'It's amazing!! I want your pantry!'

The post itself was 'liked' more than 870 times and inspired other social media users to tidy their pantries too.
