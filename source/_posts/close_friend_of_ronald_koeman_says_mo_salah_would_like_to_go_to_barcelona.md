Liverpool star Mo Salah is reportedly keen to join Barcelona according to Ronald Koeman's close friend Sjaak Swart.

Recently appointed as manager at the Nou Camp, Koeman is determined to build his squad after their Champions League embarrassment in August.

Swart, who is Ajax's record appearance holder has told Dutch Press that the new coach would love to have Salah at the Nou Camp. 

Mo Salah got off to a blistering start in the Premier League with a hat-trick against Leeds

He told Dutch publication Voetbalzone.nl as per the Daily Mirror: 'I know Koeman wants him – and I know Salah would like to go.'

When questioned where he received this information, Swart added: 'I can't. I am not going into any more details, but just believe me that I know.'

The Egyptian winger has enjoyed his time at Anfield where he has won both the Champions League and Premier League.

Salah boasts two top-flight Golden Boots to his name, and has netted 97 goals in 154 appearances across all competitions since moving to Liverpool in 2017.

He scored 19 goals last season but was left entirely out of the seven-man shortlist for last season's Player of the Year nominations.

Salah looked fired-up during Liverpool's opening game of the season, scoring a hat-trick as the Reds narrowly beat Leeds United in a 4-3 thriller.
