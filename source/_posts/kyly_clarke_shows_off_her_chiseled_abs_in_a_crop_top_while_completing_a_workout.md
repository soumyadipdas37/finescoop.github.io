She's the stunning former WAG known for her fit physique.

And on Sunday, Kyly Clarke showed off her incredible abs in a brown crop top and matching coloured tights on Instagram.

The 38-year-old flaunted her slim figure as she smiled and posed at the gym after completing a workout.

The stunning brunette styled her long locks in a high ponytail and went makeup free for the outing.

Kyly's post comes after her ex-husband Michael Clarke reflected on his life, a year after separating from his wife of seven years.

In a rare interview for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine, the 39-year-old retired Australian cricketer said that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'.

'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said.

Moving on: He confirmed his relationship with P.E Nation co-founder Pip Edwards (pictured) in July when they were spotted enjoying a romantic vacation in Noosa, Queensland 

Michael, who co-parents four-year-old daughter Kelsey Lee with Kyly, went on to reveal that he has been able to maintain a 'wonderful' friendship with his ex-wife.

In July, Michael confirmed his relationship with P.E Nation co-founder Pip Edwards when they were spotted enjoying a romantic vacation in Noosa, Queensland. 

Hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip, 40, the radio host did say that he couldn't be happier.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said.

Meanwhile, Michael separated from Kyly in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.

The Clarkes have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their daughter Kelsey Lee. 

Reports surfaced that Michael had begun dating Pip after his separation with Kyly became public knowledge.
