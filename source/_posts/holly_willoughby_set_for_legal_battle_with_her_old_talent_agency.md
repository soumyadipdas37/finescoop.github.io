Holly Willoughby is reportedly preparing for a legal battle against her old talent agency in a disagreement over money.

The This Morning presenter, 39, is taking action against the YMU Group after they are said to be demanding a percentage of her future earnings, despite Holly forming her own agency Roxy. 

The TV star is reported to be gearing up to take legal action and has a plethora of support from her showbiz friends, with a source telling The Sun: 'She won't be taken for a fool.'

The source told the publication: 'Holly is a strong, savvy, very successful woman working in a tough industry — she won’t be taken for a fool.

'It’s a real shame how things have turned out, as she was incredibly loyal to YMU for many years, but now they are demanding commission on future earnings. It is madness.' 

The insider went on to add that after setting up her 'all-female team' Roxy, Holly is all about 'empowerment' and will not 'roll over on the matter' should the dispute go down the legal route.

The Sun reported at the time that the star made the huge career decision after the coronavirus lockdown gave her time to reflect on her future.

A source told the publication: 'Lockdown has given her time to reflect and think about her future. In many ways, it has become the perfect opportunity to start afresh and it was just time for a change.

'She is really excited about managing herself and having more say over decisions on a day-to-day basis.

'She has always had such incredible business sense and is proud to be a working mum and career woman.'

The insider went on to say that Holly's career decision was the 'logical next step' after she hoped to develop a 'better work-life balance.'
