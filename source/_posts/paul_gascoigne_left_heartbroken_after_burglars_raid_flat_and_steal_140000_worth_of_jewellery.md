Paul Gascoigne has made a tearful plea to burglars who 'stole £140,000 of jewellery from his flat' - along with treasured items belonging to his late father.

The ex-footballer, 53, claims thieves broke into his luxury seaside flat in Poole, Dorset, after Piers Morgan posted a picture of him on Twitter.

The photo showed him sitting in the ITV Life Stories audience on Monday, and knowing he wasn't home, burglars broke in.

England football hero Gascoigne broke down as he told the Sunday People that his father's belongings 'meant so much' to him and said he'd 'really like them back.'   

The raiders' haul included a £2,000 gold cigar cutter and watch both owned by his late father John, according to the Mirror.  

They also took a £40,000 gold diamond-encrusted watch bought with his first pay cheque from Tottenham and a Championship medal from Glasgow Rangers.

Gascoigne went to London to support lifelong friend Vinnie Jones, 55, while he filmed his Life Stories chat. 

Police are understood to have attended his house on Tuesday.

The burglars took five watches, two bracelets, three rings, diamond earrings, £800 designer sunglasses and a genuine New York Police Department badge, the ex-footballer said.

And they also took two steaks from the freezer, according to Gascoigne.

Piers told the Sunday People he was 'sorry to hear' about the burglary and said the least he can do is 'buy him some new steaks'. 

Mailonline have contacted Dorset Police for comment.

This comes just after the England legend looked in good spirits as he got a new love heart tattoo on his left wrist.  

He visited South Coast Ink Super Studio in Bournemouth to get the artwork added to his collection.

Last month, Gazza publicly spoke out in support of his son Regan, 24, who revealed during a television interview that he is bisexual. 

In November his son spoke openly about his sexuality in a newspaper interview, followed by an appearance on Lorraine Kelly's ITV show.
