Georgia's Rugby Union vice president Merab Beselia has been arrested by police over the shooting of player Ramaz Kharazishvili, who was shot in the leg at the governing body's offices in the capital Tbilisi on Wednesday.

Kharazishvili, 32, the former captain of the Georgian national Sevens team, underwent surgery after sustaining a bullet wound to his shin and doctors have confirmed his injuries are not life threatening.

Kharazishvili, who is the president of Kiketi-based club, Jankers, is reported to be a vocal critic of the Georgian Rugby Union (GRU) and local media have claimed the shooting followed a dispute between the two men.

Georgian police have launched an investigation into the illegal purchase, possession and carrying of a firearm and damage to health.

Beselia nor any representative of the GRU has commented on the incident except to confirm that it took place. 

'Kharazishvili received injuries to his leg. His life is not in danger. All employees of the Rugby Union are cooperating with the police', Tornike Gogebashvili, acting president of the Rugby Union told 1TV.ge.

This is the latest controversy to rock Georgian rugby ahead of the country competing in the Autumn Nations Cup 2020, where they have been placed in Group A alongside England, Ireland and Wales.

The incident comes as Georgia prepare to compete at the Autumn Nations Cup 2020

32 Georgian rugby clubs recently accused Interim President Giorgi Gorgaslidze of sabotaging efforts to create a taskforce to deal with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the sport.  

They were also reported to have criticised the GRU over how it spent state funding and for the protracted election for a new president of the organisation, having failed to hire one since January due to internal disputes.

Rugby is one of the most popular sports in Georgia, and the national team has reached the world cup four times since 2003.
