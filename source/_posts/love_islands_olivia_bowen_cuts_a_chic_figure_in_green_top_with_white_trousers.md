She's spent the past several days celebrating her two-year wedding anniversary with her husband Alex Bowen.

But Olivia Bowen left her hunky husband at home on Tuesday evening, when she stepped out in style for a work dinner in the London district of Mayfair.

The former Love Island star, 26, cut a chic figure in a green top, boasting a high neckline and capped short sleeves, which she teamed with white trousers.

Olivia has been celebrating two years of marriage with husband Alex recently, with the pair dining at London's Scott's last Tuesday and STK the following evening. 

The lovebirds also pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London during the week.

Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together before reality TV cameras, and they're one of the rare Love Island couples to have stayed together. 

The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance.

When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.

'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.

'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.

'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.'
