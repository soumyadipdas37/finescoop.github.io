If you're a Spotify premium customer, you may be disappointed to learn you have missed out on a freebie - the music streaming giant was allowing households to claim a Google Nest Mini for nothing.

It is likely to have given away thousands to those who pay monthly for the service, with error messages now appearing after the offer popped up on Tuesday.

The streaming service will be sending the devices - usually worth £29 - to premium customers who applied when the offer was launched.

Freebie: Spotify was offering Google Nest Minis for its premium customers whilst stocks lasted - that appears to have been a day and a half

Google Nest Minis are a direct rival to Amazon's Alexa system – a smart speaker fitted with voice command and Google Assistant. 

However, the offer was pulled due to high demand with hundreds of disappointed customers saying they were unable to get hold of one.  

This is Money explains what the offer was, who it was available to and whether any similar offers will be available in the future.  

Premium Spotify customers pay monthly for the service to ensure they don't have to listen to any adverts, unlike those who use the service for free.

For an individual account, it will cost £9.99 but students can get this reduced to £4.99 a month.

Spotify also recently released their premium duo offering where two accounts of people living in the same house can both use one subscription and pay a reduced fee of £12.99.

There is also Spotify family which allows 6 premium for family members living under one roof to be used under one subscription at £14.99 a month.

If you are a premium customer of Spotify, you would have been able to claim the device by logging into your Spotify account through an internet browser.

The deal will have appeared and customers simply click through the links to claim theirs. 

It was available for both new and existing customers, however, Spotify have said that there was limited eligibility for those with Premium Family, Duo and Student.

It has told This is Money it will let us know if it plans to do a similar offer in the future and hasn't revealed how many were given away. 

One expert believes it could be a move to encourage people to take out a subscription.

A spokesperson for Uswitch said: 'Offering free tech has long been a staple of subscriptions services in other sectors to entice consumers to sign up. 

'Given the expected consumer belt-tightening in the coming months, due to the Covid induced recession, this could be a shrewd move from Spotify to up its game and could give customers another reason to subscribe or stay subscribed. 

'We'd expect the music streaming giant to ensure that existing premium customers are signposted to this deal, or they may risk alienating their existing subscribers.' 

Spotify Premium customers pay monthly to avoid having to listen to adverts between songs 

The offer seems to have come to an end with Spotify likely running out of stock due to high demand. 

Frustrated users have taken to social media to say they are being told they are not able to redeem a Mini whilst others have claimed they are told they are not eligible despite being premium customers. 

Spotify has not said whether the deal will be returning or advised of any future deals.  

One user said he specifically signed up to Spotify Premium to take advantage of the deal

Another user said she kept getting the same message, despite being a Premium customer

This is the sign that many users claimed to have received when applying for a Nest Mini

Another user claimed that she was told she wouldn't be able to redeem the Google Nest Mini 

A Google Nest Mini is a small speaker that can be used for listening to music around the home or utilising the Google Assistant installed.

It can be controlled through your phone or Bluetooth with users able to ask the device to play a certain song, ask what the weather is doing today or read out a recipe.

Usually retailing for around £29, users can also set reminders and timers, check their Google calendar and make hands-free calls.

All that is needed is to say 'OK Google' or 'Hey Google' out loud and issue a command.

This does mean, however, that holders will have to have a Google account to use the device.

One feature that could appeal to many is the smart home tech element. 

For example, if you have compatible smart home gadgets, like a Philips Hue Lightbulb or a Nest Thermostat, you will be able to control those using the Home Mini.

You can also, of course, link it to your Spotify account and simply say: 'OK Google, play Yesterday, by The Beatles,' for example.
