Kanye West has repeated claims that Kim Kardashian nearly aborted their daughter North, just months after sparking a marriage crisis between them. 

Speaking on comedian Nick Cannon's podcast, Cannon's Class, the renowned rapper discussed the couple's decision not to abort their daughter. 

It comes after Kanye made the revelation about the couple's private life during an explosive presidential campaign rally in South Carolina in July.

'Because of South Carolina, there are people that have decided to have a child, they have connected,' Kanye said on the podcast. 

'They never saw anyone in my position take that position [against abortion], and say "look at this this is a seven-year-old right here, and she might have never made it here."'

He continued: 'It was my wife who said "this is a soul", and the scariest thing is she had the pills - you take the pills and the next morning the baby is gone - she had them in her hand.'

Kanye's marriage to reality TV star Kim Kardashian was said to be at crisis point following the explosive rally in South Carolina. 

During the event, the rapper emotionally revealed that he and Kim wanted to have an abortion when she was pregnant with daughter North, but that God came to him and told him it was not right.

In a rambling, unscripted speech to supporters, he focused frequently on the topic of abortion, saying that in 2013 Kim 'had the pills in her hand' to have an abortion before he was inspired by God to have the child.

The interview with Nick Cannon was recorded at the West Mountain Ranch in Cody, Wyoming, and released in full today. 

The rapper also discussed his unlikely presidential bid and denied speculation he is running for president in an effort to help Donald Trump gain re-election.

West brought up rumors that he is in 'cahoots' with Republicans.  

'They're saying that they're paying you to do what you're doing to be a distraction,' Cannon said in reply. 

West discussed his unlikely presidential bid in an interview with Nick Cannon's Cannon Class podcast which aired Tuesday 

Kanye quickly quashed that suggestion, saying: 'Bro, can't nobody pay me! I got more money than Trump!'

The pair shared a hearty laugh before Cannon said: 'But people are saying that you're a distraction, and because they don't want four more years of Trump, maybe you might.

'You want an alternative of four years of Ye. Is that realistic right now in 2020?'

'I'm not running for president - I'm walking,' West replied. 

West's claim that he's richer than Trump appears to be untrue, as Forbes lists the former's net worth at $1.3billion and the latter's at $2.1billion.  

But the rapper disputed Forbes' estimate when it came out back in April, saying that his true worth exceeds $3billion.
