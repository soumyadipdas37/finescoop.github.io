The Chinese ambassador to the UK has been at the centre of controversy after his official Twitter account 'liked' a pornographic clip.

The 10-second footage, which has been removed from the diplomat's Twitter feed, shows a woman performing a sex act on a man using her feet.

The Chinese Embassy in the UK claimed that the ambassador's account had been hacked and called the move 'despicable'.

Beijing's top man to Britain, 64-year-old Liu Xiaoming (pictured on February 6), has been humiliated after his official Twitter account 'liked' X-rated pornographic content

The 10-second footage, which has been removed from the diplomat's Twitter feed, shows a woman performing a sex act on a man using her feet. The video was first uploaded last May 

Beijing's top man to Britain, 64-year-old Liu Xiaoming, is known for defending his country's treatment of Hong Kong protesters and Uighur Muslims.

His endorsement of the explicit video was flagged by Twitter user Luke de Pulford, who shared a screenshot of Mr Liu's 'likes' feed on Wednesday morning.

Mr Pulford, a member of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, said that he 'felt a bit mean' for calling out Mr Liu.

'But then I remembered the #Uyghur concentration camps and #HongKong and quickly got over it,' he wrote.

Felt a bit mean for this. But then I remembered the #Uyghur concentration camps and #HongKong and quickly got over it.

I want to thank @AmbLiuXiaoMing for blocking me If this is how he spends his time - when he's not spreading mendacity or harassing critics - I would rather not see@MahuiChina what do you think of your boss' habits?@AmbCuiTiankai @ChinaAmbUN is this how you use Twitter too? https://t.co/CtqFmQRcXd

Commenting on the incident, Benedict Rogers, chair and co-founder of UK-based human rights group Hong Kong Watch, said 'I want to thank @AmbLiuXiaoMing for blocking me'.

'If this is how he spends his time - when he's not spreading mendacity or harassing critics - I would rather not see,' Mr Rogers tweeted.

The Chinese Embassy in the UK said that the incident was a 'vicious' attack from 'some anti-China elements' against Mr Liu.

In a statement, it said: 'Recently, some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public.

'The Chinese Embassy strongly condemns such abominable behaviour.

'The Embassy has reported this to Twitter company and urged the latter to make thorough investigations and handle this matter seriously.' 

Mr Liu has repeatedly championed Beijing's rhetoric over key diplomatic issues, such as Hong Kong, coronavirus, Huawei and human rights abuses, as tensions between China and the UK escalated.

In July, he warned the UK it would 'pay the price' for treating China like a 'hostile country'.

He said Britain would have to 'bear the consequences' of its foreign policy decisions and that would mean losing the benefits of being Beijing's 'partner'.

Liu Xiaoming also claimed some British politicians appear to be 'clamouring for a new Cold War' as he insisted China wants to be the UK's 'friend'.

Appearing on the Andrew Marr Show, Liu Xiaoming denied reports that China is carrying out a programme of sterilisation of Uighur women in the western Xinjiang region.

He insisted Uighur Muslims lived in 'peace and harmony' despite being confronted with a video appearing to show shackled prisoners being herded onto trains.
