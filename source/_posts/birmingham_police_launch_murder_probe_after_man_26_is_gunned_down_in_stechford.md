Meanwhile, in a statement released through the force, family members paid tribute to Mr Nazit, whose death they say has left their \'lives shattered and hearts broken\'.
The family said \'Life as we knew it will never be the same.
\'As a family we are united and trying to heal, but the process won\'t be an easy one.
Not only have we lost a father, husband, son, brother, we have lost our friend and protector.
\'Everyone who knew him will have their own unique memory with him, and that, in these hard times will get them through it.\'
The family also asked members of the public to to share \'distressing footage\' of the incident on social media, before adding \'We thank the police and ambulance service for their assistance and are forever grateful.
