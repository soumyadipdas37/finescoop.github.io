Murtaza Nazit, 26, suffered a fatal gunshot wound during yesterday&#039;s shooting in the Stechford area of Birmingham
Police have tonight released a picture of a father who was shot dead in Birmingham as his family paid tribute to their &#039;friend and protector&#039; and insisted &#039;justice will be served&#039;.
Murtaza Nazit, 26, suffered a fatal gunshot wound during yesterday&#039;s shooting in the Stechford area of the West Midlands city - which has seen a&nbsp;spate of knife and gun attacks this week.
Detectives from West Midlands Police have since launched a murder investigation, following the shooting, which took on Bagshaw Road, just before 8pm yesterday.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, in a statement released through the force, family members paid tribute to Mr Nazit, whose death they say has left their &#039;lives shattered and hearts broken&#039;.
The family said &#039;Life as we knew it will never be the same.
&#039;As a family we are united and trying to heal, but the process won&#039;t be an easy one.
Not only have we lost a father, husband, son, brother, we have lost our friend and protector.
&#039;Everyone who knew him will have their own unique memory with him, and that, in these hard times will get them through it.&#039;
The family also asked members of the public to to share &#039;distressing footage&#039; of the incident on social media, before adding &#039;We thank the police and ambulance service for their assistance and are forever grateful.

&#039;To god we belong and to god we shall return. Justice will be served. If not in this life then the hereafter.&#039;
Today, Detective Chief Inspector Scott Griffiths, of West Midland&#039;s Police&#039;s homicide unit, said &#039;This is a shocking crime that has resulted in a young father losing his life.
&#039;I want to say thank you to the community who have really pulled together during this time and would urge anyone who has any information who have not yet spoken to us to get in touch.
&#039;We are working around the clock to understand exactly what happened and find those responsible.&#039;
In an earlier statement, he said &#039;We have spoken to a number of witnesses to try and get a clear understanding of the events leading up to this incident.
&#039;I would encourage anyone with information or dash cam footage who has not yet spoken to us to get in touch.&#039;
He added &#039;We need the help of the community to come forward with information so that we can find the person or people responsible.
&#039;The man&#039;s family are devastated and are being supported by specialist officers at this difficult time.&#039;
The shooting is the latest in a string of gruesome killings to hit Birmingham in the last week, which saw six people stabbed in just 12 hours and left another two people dead
Officers have secured the scene to preserve evidence and are speaking to witnesses and examining CCTV. Anyone with information should call the force on 101, quoting log 3897 from August 28.
It followed a weekend of violence in the city, which saw six people stabbed in just 12 hours and left two people dead.
West Midlands Police have identified a&nbsp;22-year-old man who was fatally shot in the stomach in broad daylight as Naasir Francis.

Naasir was fatally wounded in broad daylight on Lozells Road to the north of the city centre on Wednesday.
His family paid tribute in a statement released by the West Midlands force, saying &#039;Naasir was the warm entity that bought a sense of security to the family. A deep comfort has been lost by his mother and siblings.
&#039;A much-loved and respected young man in his community, Naasir&#039;s charming personality, birthed a light of spiritedness in the eyes of his family, a light that has dulled since his passing.&#039;&nbsp;
And last Saturday another man was violently stabbed to death on the roadside in the Bournbrook area of the city.
Thomas Rogers, 26, was found with fatal injuries on the Bristol Road in Birmingham at around 4.55pm.
He was taken to hospital but pronounced dead shortly after arrival and a post-mortem examination revealed he died as a result of stab wounds to the chest.&nbsp;
His brother Samuel, 30, has been charged with his murder alongside a second man, 22-year-old Ryan Hurt.

The week before that four young men were left injured in two double shootings 14 hours apart as the city&#039;s deputy police and crime commissioner warned &#039;Things may get worse&#039;.
Deputy PCC Waheed Saleem said &#039;The recent upsurge in violence, including these recent shootings is very worrying.
&#039;I&#039;ve been saying for sometime now that the criminals are coming out of lockdown and are back committing violence and likely &#039;settling scores&#039;.
&#039;When you couple this with the usual surge in crime during the summer months, I am concerned about the possibility of very high demand for our police.&#039;
