He's the seasoned reality TV hunk searching for love on the latest season of The Bachelor.

And on Wednesday night, Locky Gilbert, 31, revealed a little more than viewers bargained for when he stripped down to a pair of black jocks for a racy group date. 

It wasn't long before fans shared their thoughts about the towering hunk's half naked display on social media.   

'It won't stop looking at me!' On Wednesday, Locky Gilbert stripped down to his jocks on The Bachelor and viewers were disturbed by what they saw

'It won't stop looking at me,' one viewer cryptically wrote, before begging the show's wardrobe department to, 'Pls get him some pants'. 

The sentiment was echoed by a second fan who added, 'I really wish they made Locky put some pants on.'  

A third fan seemed caught by surprise at the adventure seeker's defiant display in a pair of black trunks.  

'I wasn't emotionally ready to see this much of Locky,' they wrote.  







Not impressed: It wasn't long before fans shared their thoughts about the towering hunk's half naked display on social media

Meanwhile, others viewers expressed concerns for Locky as the remaining ladies vying for his attention suggestively rubbed their hands over his body. 

'How does this guy not go full wood with all this?' commented one user. 

Another quipped: 'So this is just an exercise in not getting an erection for Locky?'
