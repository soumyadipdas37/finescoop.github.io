She made headlines on Wednesday for her apparent vile response to her ex Reece Hawkins and his fiancée London Goheen's pregnancy news.  

And a day later, Tammy Hembrow, 26,  has returned to Instagram with a very cryptic message.

Posting two photos of herself modelling a skimpy white bandeau top and matching mini-skirt, the mother-of-two ambiguously wrote in the caption: 'Don't take it personal.'

She proceeded to spruik the designer of her outfit as well as provide a discount code for the online retailer.   

It's unclear whether Tammy's post relates to Wednesday's saga, which saw her raise eyebrows for taking an apparent swipe at her ex-fiancé's baby joy.  

Just hours after Reece, 25, and London, 22, announced their pregnancy on Wednesday, Tammy uploaded a video to Instagram Stories of herself miming to a set of very telling lyrics from the song Pressure In My Palms by Aminé.

Rolling her eyes and dancing in the front seat of her car, Tammy mouthed the lyrics: 'I hate a b**ch who think a baby finna keep a n****  (I hate you h*e).' 

She continued to pout at the camera while the next set of lyrics played: 'Why every time he see his kids, we gotta see the picture? (I hate you too man).' 

Tammy, who shares custody of son Wolf, five, and daughter Saskia, four, with their father Reece, used an angel-themed filter on the video to give herself a sparkly halo and wings. 

Trying to say something? on Wednesday, Tammy appeared to issue a vile response to the news that her ex Reece is expecting his first child with London  

Interesting timing: Just hours after Reece and London announced their baby joy, Tammy uploaded a video of herself miming along to the lyrics: 'I hate a b**ch who think a baby finna keep a n**** (I hate you h*e)' 

There have been ongoing rumours of a feud between London and Tammy, with the pair taking potshots at one another on social media.  

Tammy and Reece split in 2018 after four years together. Not long after the break-up, Reece moved on with his new partner, American model London. 

Reece and London announced they were expecting their first child together on Wednesday, just weeks after getting engaged.

Reece also shared similar images of the pair, calling London his 'Baby Momma' and the 'love of my life.' 

'Baby Momma alert. Having a baby with the love of my life and my best friend,' he wrote. 

Sharing is caring: American model London, who recently moved to the Gold Coast to live with Reece, also shared a lengthy statement on her Instagram story, explaining that she'll be posting about her pregnancy journey on another platform, before linking to her OnlyFans account

'I'm so excited that I can finally share with y'all the news that I'm PREGNANT!!!' London's post began. 

She said she made the decision to post on OnlyFans because over the years she and Reece have been 'harassed to the point where we've had to seek legal action.'

'We've also been harassed to the point where we've had to seek legal action a few times due to harassment, bullying and stalking over the last year... with that being said I've decided I'm going to share my pregnancy journey on another platform where I feel SAFE and POSITIVE,' she explained. 

She added that she wants to welcome her child in a 'happy and healthy environment.'

'This is the most magical time in my life and I feel so blessed to be able to share my journey and for the people who support us to be involved in watching our family grow together,' she concluded.

The brunette beauty also showed off her luxurious ring from luxury jewellery brand Tiffany & Co, declaring 'it's perfect!'

It features a yellow square centre stone and a halo of diamonds around the base, and was presented in a baby blue box with the words 'Marry me!' on the front in gold.

The proposal took place at the Sheraton Grand Mirage Resort in Port Douglas.
