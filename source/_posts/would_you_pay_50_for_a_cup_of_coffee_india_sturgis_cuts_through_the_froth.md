title: Would you pay £50 for a cup of coffee? INDIA STURGIS cuts through the froth...

 When times are tough, it's the little luxuries we relish. In which case, Queens of Mayfair might be on to something by offering a £50 cup of coffee.

The 15g of Ethiopian beans — which make slightly more than a Starbucks short cup serving — are so expensive a £25 deposit is required on booking at the London cafe.

At least part of the reason for the high cost is the rarity of the beans, which won the 2020 Cup of Excellence, a sort of Strictly Come Dancing for coffee suppliers globally.

Only two UK businesses — Difference Coffee Co (which supplies Queens of Mayfair) and Harrods —were invited to bid for the exclusive batch at auction, which would retail at £2,000 per kilo.

Winning farmer Nigussie Gemeda Mude grows his crop in a three-hectare area of the Sidama region of Ethiopia and has a limited haul of 270kg. And 225g of his beans have filtered down to Queens of Mayfair, equivalent to 15 cups of coffee. When I call to book, six have already been sold in 24 hours.

But is it really worth £50? Only a tasting can answer this.

So it is that I find myself on a splendidly immaculate Mayfair street sitting in front of a beautifully ridged crystal goblet and feeling like a fish out of water.

Elia Cordaro, a senior barista at the recently opened artisan coffee shop, painstakingly weighs out the coffee beans, grinds them in a precise titanium mill (from Comandante, £205, if you're into that sort of thing), dampens some filter paper to stop the coffee tasting of the paper (which would be a slap in the face, says Elia) and delicately pours 250ml of water heated to 94c over the coffee for no more than two and a half minutes.

One of only two British buyers was the coffee shop Queens of Mayfair. The coffee is available on a first come first served basis, with only limited quantities available 

This is so as not to scorch the coffee or extract too much of it, which leads to bitterness.

The highly thought of coffee, appearing more of an orange tone than most

He stops midway to allow something called a bloom — the bubbly, fast release of carbon dioxide that happens when ground coffee comes into contact with hot water — and which prevents sourness. I feel like I'm in both a chemistry class and theatre performance. Finally, a glass is filled.

I swill then smell it. The aroma is like that of watery tea but the taste is clean and bright. And I like it. Elia describes the brew as having hints of peach and apricot and subtle almond. Satsumas, I say hopefully? Maybe, he says, generously.

The fact is I can barely tell the difference between a cappuccino and a flat white, which is why I've brought along Bertie Sewell, coffee trader for Olam, a major food and agri-business company. He holds up the glass to the light and sips then slurps the coffee to the back of his throat, a technique to accentuate flavour. He gets a fruity, floral flavour profile.

It's lovely, but still, £50? I'm not sure.

'That's because the series of processes and requirements from a truly good cup of coffee are not well understood,' explains Sewell, patiently.

A view of the coffee filter. The coffee beans used (right, in packaging) are very sensitive to their environment

'Think about what you spend on excellent wine. It's the same for speciality coffee, which has many more flavour compounds and a complex value chain.

'Great beans require hand-picking, washing properly, drying properly (constant turning); they must be exported within time and under exact conditions.

'They require fermentation; roasting, which caramelises the beans and develops a whole other profile of flavour, then a barista must make it to a certain standard.

'The whole chain is reliant on one another to make amazing coffee. It's worth it because of the journey it has gone on and the expertise needed to brew it to perfection.'

There is also a drive to decommodify good coffee and pay those producing it more fairly. For example, Nigussie Gemeda Mude, the Ethiopian Cup of Excellence producer, rightly received full auction price as part of a fair-trade deal.

So maybe outrageously expensive coffee is actually a good thing?

I'm almost convinced.

Black Ivory Coffee, £77.41 for 35g (£33.18 per 15g serving), blackivorycoffee.com

Made in northern Thailand, coffee cherries — the fruit that contains the seed which is roasted to become a coffee bean — are eaten whole by elephants, digested, removed from the animals’ waste and made into coffee.

The elephants’ stomach acid breaks down the protein in coffee, a key factor in its bitterness, to produce a unique flavour. Less bitter than regular coffee with notes of chocolate, malt, spice and — shudder — a hint of grass.

Saint Helena Coffee Beans, £60 for 125g (£7.20 per 15g serving), Fortnum & Mason

NapoleOn Bonaparte was a fan of the coffee grown on St Helena, an island in the Atlantic 1,200 miles off the west coast of Africa, which has long helped raise its price tag. Famous for a fragrant caramel flavour with hints of citrus.

Kopi Luwak, £16 for 50g (£4.80 per 15g serving), kopiluwakco.com

Kopi Luwak relies on processing of the coffee seeds by the digestive system of the palm civet cat in Vietnam. It’s extremely rare — only about 500kg are collected per year — and with a heavy aftertaste. The traditional method has paved the way for intensive farming in places where conditions are questionable and the cats are force-fed cherries. Ensure you buy only from ethical sources.

Jamaica Blue Mountain Ground Coffee, £35 for 125g (£4.20 per 15g serving), Fortnum & Mason

Cultivated at 5,000ft above sea level in the volcanic soil of the Jamaican Blue Mountains, where rainfall is heavy and the water supply therefore abundant, this has a mild, fragrant taste with chocolate and citrus notes.

Panama Geisha Coffee, £49.99 for 200g (£3.75 per 15g serving), amazon.co.uk

Grown at high altitude in Western Panama’s Chiriqui province, this coffee is known for the plant’s superior disease resistance and bean’s elongated shape. Full-bodied and with mango and mandarin notes it has been described as the coffee equivalent of a bottle of champagne, great for special occasions.
