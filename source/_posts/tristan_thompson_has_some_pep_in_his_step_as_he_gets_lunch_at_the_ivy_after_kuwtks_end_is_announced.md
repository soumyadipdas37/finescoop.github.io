He has been spending quality time with his daughter True and off-again on-again ex Khloe Kardashian during coronavirus lockdown. 

But Tristan Thompson went without them on Thursday as he grabbed lunch with a friend at the celebrity hot spot The Ivy in West Hollywood. 

The 29-year-old NBA star went casual for the outing in a sporty all black look, looking like he was breathing a sigh of relief after the end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians was announced.

Tristan donned black athletic shorts, along with a black hoodie that featured a red emblem on the right side of his chest. 

He added a black reusable face mask as he headed back to his car to follow restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic and a black cap turned backwards. 

The Cleveland Cavaliers player paired the red on his sweatshirt with red and black sneakers that were left largely untied and white above the ankle socks.

Earlier this week, a source close to the sportsman has revealed he is happy to 'spoil' his daughter.

 'Tristan often spoils her like she is daddy's little princess,' a source told UsWeekly. 'He wants her to live her very best life in more ways than one.'  

Tristan and Khloe are rumored to have recently rekindled their romance, but a source close to the 36-year-old beauty has insisted she 'doesn't really care' what people think of her love life.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star previously split from Tristan after he was caught kissing Jordyn Woods.

The insider said: 'At this point, Khloe doesn't really care about any backlash from fans about her being back together with Tristan. 

'She has already been through that ringer and accepts that some fans are always going to have their own, often negative, opinion.'

Despite the speculation, Khloe's focus remains on raising her daughter.

The source added: '[Khloe is only concerned about] her little girl and raising her with her father, having him in her life, figuring out things with Tristan and having a healthy relationship dynamic across the board. 

Quality time: Tristan has been spending much of coronavirus lockdown with his two-year-old daughter True and her mother, his off-again on-again ex, Khloe Kardashian  

'[The Kardashian/Jenner family are] supportive and don't judge. [They] just want Khloe to be happy, for them to work things out and set a positive example for True.' 

Along with his two-year-old daughter, Tristan also has Prince, three, from an earlier relationship, but he previously admitted to treating his two children very differently.  

Speaking in 2018, he shared: 'With a boy, it's just like, "Hey, man, you'll be alright, man. Stop crying."

'But, it's like, "True, it's gonna be OK, you know? We're right here. daddy's here to feed you. It's me! Look, yeah!" [Raising a girl is] way different, but it's fun, though. It changes you.'
