A clever Australian mum has shared images of how she transformed a second-hand $40 television cabinet from Facebook marketplace into the perfect storage space for her bins.

Tisha posted to the Mums Who Build, Renovate and Decorate Facebook group and said she was 'sick' of her 'ugly bins' always being on show.

She removed the original doors and shelf from the cabinet and made one single door that tilts downwards to expose the two bins inside.

'[I] was sick of my ugly bins, so revamped a $40 TV cabinet from marketplace!' Tisha said online.

'Not a professional job and making a drawer at the bottom was challenging, so made plenty of mistakes but I absolutely love it and am so proud of myself!'

To change the colour of the wood, she used a charcoal chalk paint then a polyurethane clear varnish on top.

'This is awesome, looks so good, love the idea! Great handy work too!' one woman said in the comments.

'Simply genius!' another said, a third added: 'Love this!! Make me one please.'

'All of a sudden, I'm scouring marketplace for a tv cabinet! Thanks for the inspiration!' another said.

One mum also asked how the bins are removed if needing to be cleaned, to which Tisha replied: 'They actually come out through top fairly easily when I angle correctly, and the back I made a swing door so I can completely pull everything out and clean!'

AFTER: The cabinet is wide enough to fit two bins and the exterior looks far more stylish than it originally was

Tisha also made a fully functioning drawer at the bottom of the cabinet and added seashell-like handles to the outside
