Treasured family photographs from way back when bring joy to households across the world and now people are trying to recreate their special memories with their relatives. 

Families across the world have been digging out their vintage clothes and heading back to their old homes to stage pictures decades after they were first taken. 

BoredPanda has compiled an online gallery of some of the most impressive remakes of much-loved images as well as documenting some startling family resemblances.
