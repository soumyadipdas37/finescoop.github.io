An Australian makeup artist has warned against getting lip fillers at 'random a**e places' after the injections she had been getting for five years migrated up to her nose, and she was forced to have them dissolved.

Shani Grimmond, 23, shared a video on her YouTube channel detailing the process of getting filler removed from your face, saying she was 'excited and nervous' about her visit to a reputable clinic. 

'I've been looking for a good place to dissolve my lips for a year and I finally found it,' she said, mentioning Angel Aesthetics Clinic in Brisbane, Queensland.

'I've been looking for a good place to dissolve my lips for a year and I finally found a place,' she said, shouting out Angel Aesthetics Clinic on Queensland's Gold Coast (pictured left at 18 and right at 23)

The popular beauty blogger said she first dabbled with cosmetic injectables at age 18 and has a total of 6mL of filler in her lips, which has been inserted by six different beauty salons.

While she was happy with the results for many years, more recently she started noticing that it 'looked like she had a mouth guard in' because her top lip was protruding.  

'So we've got filler in my lips that hasn't dissolved naturally and instead has migrated above my lip. It's really quite scary to be honest,' she said.

Shani wanted to 'start again' and decided to get all of the filler removed, a process which involves numbing the lips before injecting hyaluronidase into them (pictured left after getting them dissolved and right four days later)

Shani wanted to 'start again' and decided to get all of the filler removed, a process which involves numbing the lips before injecting hyaluronidase into them.

Hyaluronidase is a dissolving agent which helps the body breakdown the filler itself.

The needles can leave the patient swollen and with significant bruising so Shani was prepared for two weeks spent at home recovering.

She documented the experience by sharing footage of her lips immediately after the treatment, a week later - when she had to get more hyaluronidase injected into her puffy top lip - and almost three weeks on, when she looked like an '18-year-old version of herself'.  

'I am so relieved that it's done. This is the lesson I have had to learn. Going to random places and I don't know what they're putting in there... this is what happens,' she said.

Although her lips have now returned to their previous state (pictured), Shani is hoping to get them refilled slightly to achieve a natural result

Although her lips have now returned to their previous state, Shani is hoping to get them refilled slightly to achieve a natural result.  

The maximum amount she will get put back in is 2mls.

Many of her loyal followers were pleased to see Shani's lip reduction and said it made the youthful brunette look even younger.

'You look so much younger without the filler, the natural lips look so nice,' one woman said.

'It's actually comforting to see all of these influencers getting their filler dissolved and being aware of the migration and promoting a more natural look,' said another.

A third added: 'I totally understand you like yourself more with bigger lips, but girl, I actually love your natural lips SO MUCH I think it honestly makes you look younger and suits you better'.

She will be uploading a separate video showcasing her new, slightly plumper lips.
