The five competing teams on The Block presented their guest ensuite to the judges on Sunday night's episode.

And for Daniel and Jade's 1930s reveal, judge Neale Whitaker certainly did not hold back.  

The 58-year-old slammed the couple's interpretation, saying nothing in the room referenced the decade.   

'It's a complete cop-out!' The Block judge Neale Whitaker (pictured) SLAMMED Daniel and Jade's 'generic' guest ensuite, as it 'ignores' any reference to the 1930s on Sunday's episode

'It's a cop-out. It's a complete cop-out,' Neale said, describing the space as 'a generic contemporary bathroom'.

Daniel and Jade presented a guest ensuite with references to 2020, such as marble walls and ledges, and contemporary tapware and finishes.  

'It's a room that's ignored a lot of great opportunity. Yes, it is beautiful, meeting a brief, and they have taken the easiest path.

Neale said of the space: 'It's a room that's ignored a lot of great opportunity. Yes, it is beautiful, meeting a brief, and they have taken the easiest path' 

'They've thought, "Oh, well, all mirrors at the moment look [Art] Deco, so we'll just put one of those in - that'll keep the judges happy". Sorry, doesn't work.'   

For Harry and Tash's 1920's guest ensuite, the critique went off to a stellar start.

Neale was in favour of the teale wall tiles and skylight, while fellow judge Shaynna Blaze liked the curves on the cabinetry and toilet.

However, the choice of floor tiles was poorly received particularly by Shaynna, who found them to be from an earlier era.   

Neale said he was 'clutching at straws' to find elements of the 1920s in the room, while Darren Palmer found an issue with there not being any underfloor heating.  

All three judges were in awe of Sarah and George's 1940's guest ensuite, with Shaynna complimenting the luxury details.

Nailed it: Darren praised the couple for their attention to detail, specifically with the choice of tapware and styling, with Shaynna adding that the pink colour palette was perfect

Neale even went so far as to describe the space as 'part bathroom, part cathedral'.  

Luke and Jasmin's 1910's guest ensuite was praised by the judges, with Darren saying that while it matches the period, it also still feels contemporary.

Praise: Jimmy and Tam's 1950's guest ensuite (pictured) was well received by Darren, with the judge describing the space as having a 'retro, childhood charm' 

Shaynna commended their choice of wall paneling and the soft print on the delicate floor tiles. 

Jimmy and Tam's 1950's guest ensuite was well received by Darren, with the judge describing the space as having a 'retro, childhood charm'.

Shaynna was in awe of the 'divine sink' with its modern interpretation, while Neale said the bathroom was the perfect combination of the 1950's and 2020. 

Jimmy and Tam received the highest combined score from the judges, 28-and-a-half points.

The Block continues Monday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine.  

This week's winners: Jimmy and Tam received the highest combined score from the judges, 28-and-a-half points
