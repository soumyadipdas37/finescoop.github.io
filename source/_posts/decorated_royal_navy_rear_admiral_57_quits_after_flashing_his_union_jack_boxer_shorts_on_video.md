A decorated Royal Navy Rear Admiral has stepped down after he exposed his Union Jack-emblazoned boxer shorts at the end of a work video call. 

Tim Lowe, 57, who was given a CBE in 2017, left his colleagues flabbergasted by standing up at the end of the online meeting to reveal his underwear. 

A source has claimed that Lowe, who lives in Cullompton, Devon, and worked in the Navy for more than 30 years, was simply doing it as a joke to raise spirits.

However, a complaint was made and an investigation was launched into his conduct. 

Rear Admiral Lowe has since retired his position as the boss of the Ministry of Defence's UK Hydrographic Office for 'personal reasons'.

His friends have insisted that he wore the underpants over the top of his trousers.  

A source told The Sun: 'He intended this as a bit of humour to raise spirits at the end of a video meeting at the height of the pandemic — it didn't go down as he intended. It's backfired on him.'

Lowe's wife Lynda, 63, denied claims that her husband thrust his crotch towards the camera during the video call in June.

She added: 'Well, it happened but not like that.'  

Lowe was appointed chief executive of the UK Hydrographics Office in 2019 and hadn't been in his role for even a year before stepping down. 

The Hydrographics Office are a trading fund of the MoD that sources, processes and provides access to marine data which can help others to make the oceans safer and sustainable.

Lowe initially joined the office in August 2015 as UK National Hydrographer while serving as a Rear Admiral in the Royal Navy.

Hydrography deals with the measurement and description of the physical features of oceans, seas, coastal areas, lakes and rivers. And predicts their changes over time in order to help others safely navigate the waters. 

Lowe was a navigation and underwater warfare specialist and commanded on shore as well as afloat (three sea Commands and two operational commands). 

He has also led the Combined Maritime Forces counter piracy activity in the Indian Ocean and established the Shared Awareness and Deconfliction meeting.

Rear Admiral Lowe (pictured with ex-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson) has since retired his position as the boss of the Ministry of Defence's UK Hydrographic Office for 'personal reasons'

He also completed two assignments with NATO and policy and operational staff appointments in the Minister of Defence, Flotilla and Fleet HQs.  

Back when he was appointed chief executive in 2019, Lowe said: 'I am looking forward to leading the UKHO into these exciting times ahead, as we continue to collaborate with our friends and partners across the globe to grasp this unique opportunity and unlock the value of marine geospatial data.'  

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'We do not tolerate any form of inappropriate behaviour.'
