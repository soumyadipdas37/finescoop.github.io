They welcomed their first child together, daughter Rani Rose, in 2018.

And Kate Hudson took to Instagram to share a sweet snapshot of beau Danny Fujikawa, 34, and their darling one-year-old on Sunday evening.

'Daddy's girl ❤️ #sundaylazyday,' captioned the 41-year-old actress as the father-daughter duo cuddled up to one another on the couch.

In the photo, Rani donned a grey and white raglan top and a pair of pint-sized skinny jeans.

Danny, who Kate began dating in 2016, looked ultra cozy in a white tee as he slumped into the cushy couch with his only child.

Danny and Kate often document their tranquil family life on social media, from their afternoon lounging sessions to their neighborhood strolls.

The Fool's Gold actress dished about her quarantine life with Fujikawa in an interview with Andy Cohen on his hit Bravo show Watch What Happens Live in April.

During the remote appearance, Cohen, 52, inquired about Danny and Kate's sex life and if the pandemic has been a positive.

'I think it's even more than that. I think it's positive for knowing that I'm with the right person,' she explained.

'There's nobody else I'd want to be quarantined with right now. He's just the best.' 

Though Rani is Danny's only child, Kate is also mom to sons Ryder, 16, and Bingham, nine.

The Almost Famous star shares Ryder with ex husband Chris Robinson, 53. The former couple were married from 2000 until their divorce in 2007.

Bingham's dad happens to be Muse frontman Matt Bellamy, 42, who dated Kate from 2010 until their traumatic split in 2014.

In an interview with Allure, Kate opened up about her 'painful' split from Bellamy and how they worked to peacefully co-parent Bingham.

'Relationships ending are painful, and you can choose to carry that or you can choose to reframe it. If Matt and I had a great relationship, we would still be together, but we chose to move on because we had different visions of how we wanted to live our lives,' explained Kate.

She added: 'That doesn't mean, though, that we can't rebuild something that would be the best thing for the kids.'

Earlier in the day, Kate paid tribute to fellow Hollywood royalty Gwyneth Paltrow on her 48th birthday. 

'Happy Birthday we love you,' she wrote along with a stunning black and white photo from a star-studded event. 

Kate has successfully juggled a hugely consistent Hollywood career, while raising her three children.

And she recently appeared on Naomi Campbell's podcast No Filter to discuss the demands of her job and the harsh environment actresses are subjected to in Hollywood.

Balance: 'The reality is I have three kids I love, I’ve got a lot of work and I love making movies. Nothing will ever keep me away from making movies,' admitted Kate to the 50-year-old supermodel

'The reality is I have three kids I love, I’ve got a lot of work and I love making movies. Nothing will ever keep me away from making movies,' admitted Kate to the 50-year-old supermodel. 

'The issue with movie making is that it takes you away, and it’s really really sh***y hours, and when you’re doing it it’s like "I better really really like this story. I better love the people I’m working with. I better love this director," or it really is like why am I here?'

She went on to suggest that, although she loves the movie business, there is a clear gender bias against actresses, which it makes it harder for them to forge their way.

'One thing in Hollywood – women don’t get the same opportunities, and what I mean by that is one failure is like an equivalent to three failures for a guy. 

'One female box office not great opening for a woman… the next time they’re thinking of casting you for something they’ll be like, "her last movie didn’t do great."

'For a guy, they usually give them about three to five chances, right? And they’ll still get paid, and they’ll still get the opportunity but for some reason with women it’s a little bit different.'

'The other thing is that when women get really famous, they don't really want the famous person in the movie, they want a new face, whereas for a guy it's totally different. I think it’s just a bad antiquated habit,' explained Kate.
