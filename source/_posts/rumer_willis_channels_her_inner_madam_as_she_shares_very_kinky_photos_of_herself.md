Rumer Willis has shared a photos from her very kinky, bondage-style photo shoot.

The series, which was shot by photographer Tyler Shields and titled Bondage, captured Rumer in an array of NSFW poses, including a snap of the actress submissively kneeling on the floor. 

Rumer, 32, was tied up with a black rope as she kneeled on the ground in her thigh-high boots, with her gaze cast towards the floor.

'I'll call you sir': Rumer Willis shared photos from her very kinky, bondage-style photo shoot on Monday 

'...and I'll call you sir,' Rumer captioned the racy image.

The first snap Rumer posted Sunday was of herself working a black leather bodysuit and thigh-high PVC boots.

The star struck a saucy pose with her body expertly angled to highlight her curves as she rested a leather riding crop inside her mouth.

'Call Me Madam,' Rumer wrote in the caption.

Rumer was quarantining in Idaho with her family, but has since returned to her home in Los Angeles.  

Earlier this month Rumer raised eyebrows after she was spotted with newly single actor Armie Hammer.

The duo were spotted strolling around LA together with their arms wrapped around each other.

Armie had recently split from wife Elizabeth Chambers after 10 years of marriage, and the images sparked speculation he may have moved on with Rumer.

Rumer, who won the 20th season of Dancing With The Stars in 2015, is the eldest of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's three daughters, Scout, 29, and Tallulah, 26.

Former power couple Demi and Bruce were married in 1987 and divorced in 2000
