She announced last week that she is expecting her first child with husband Taylor Goldsmith.

The 36-year-old also detailed how she's been suffering food aversions throughout the past  15 weeks.

Moore began by sharing a selfie as she sat in her car which included a steaming cup of coffee emoji.

In text, she explained: 'Just sitting here thinking: will I ever enjoy coffee again?'

She went on: 'It's one of my major food aversions right now (and I know - probably for the best) but it makes me sad because I used to dream about coffee before bed.'

She returned to her Instagram Story a little while later to thank her social media followers for reassuring her that an aversion to coffee is quite common during pregnancy. 

'I'm fully accepting that my love of coffee will come back and if it doesn't, it's all good, a small price to pay,' she shared.
