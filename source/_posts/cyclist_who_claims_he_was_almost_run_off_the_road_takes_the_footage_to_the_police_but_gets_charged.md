A furious cyclist who claimed he was almost run off the road has been charged by police.  

The rider was cycling along a narrow road in Macmasters Beach, on the NSW Central Coast, on August 9 when he was overtaken by a Toyota driver. 

Footage captured on the bicycle's rear-facing camera showed the Toyota swerving out from behind the cyclist and narrowly passing on his right.   

'Took this to NSW Police and I ended up getting booked for not riding as near to left of the road as possible,' the cyclist explained.   

A cyclist claimed he was almost run off the road by a Toyota driver on the NSW Central Coast (pictured). He showed the footage to police but was charged for not riding closer to the left

The rider said he was unable to drive any further to the left as it was unsafe. 

'Descending down an unguttered road with blind driveways at 50km/h, and I was as close to the left of the road that was safe in the circumstances,' he said.

'It seems NSW Police intend on keeping roads as perilous as possible for cyclists.' 

The video showed both the bike and car driving down a hill on the suburban road surrounded by homes and trees. 

Two red lines were also overlaid on the video image and appeared to show the Toyota driving within a metre distance of the cyclist when overtaking.   

The Toyota driver did not cross over the road's double unbroken lines and remained within the left lane to pass the cyclist.  

Viewers were quick to defend the rider and called for the cyclist to dispute his fine.   

'A clear case of police going on the attack of a cyclist. Wet conditions, fast downhill probably on the speed limit.  

'Riding in the gutter is not practicable at all,' one user said. 

The cyclist claimed is was unsafe for him to ride further to he left as there were hidden driveways and no gutters on the suburban street in Macmasters Beach (pictured) 

'The vehicle is the danger, not you as a cyclist.  

'I'd be disputing that in court,' another commenter wrote.    

Other commenters told the cyclist he needed to 'move left'. 

'What the cops said is what my very thoughts were. Move over a little bit, you're like out in the middle of the road,' one user said.     

Transport for NSW have stated 'drivers must give bicycle riders at least a metre of space'. 

'Drivers passing a bicycle rider must allow a distance of at least one metre when the speed limit is 60km/h or less,' the road rules website read. 

'Both single lane and multi-lane overtaking involves risk and requires extreme care. If you have any doubts, don't overtake and wait until it is safer.' 

NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia the fine was worth $116.   

Viewers condemned the impatient driver and urged the cyclist to dispute his charge
