An Australian renter has completely transformed her laundry room without making any irreversible changes - and she only used furniture from discount stores Kmart and IKEA.

The woman, who lives in Perth, Western Australia, was looking to makeover the cluttered space without spending hundreds of dollars, but still wanted it to be functional.  

'I am renting so I was limited as to what I can do, so everything had to be functioning,' she wrote on Facebook alongside before and after photos.

'The before picture is when I began the process.'

The prints on the walls and three laundry baskets stacked together ($4.99 each) were from IKEA and everything else was from Kmart.

That includes the numerous white plastic and rattan baskets she has installed to keep things in a neat and tidy manner. 

'I've seen pretty awesome laundry bins from Kmart but couldn't get my hands on them,' she said.

'I finished this over a month ago and it's still functioning well.'

'You've done a mighty job with it! And so few extra parts needed,' one person said

The results impressed a number of home improvement enthusiasts who called the work she had done 'beautiful'.

'You've done a mighty job with it! And so few extra parts needed,' one person said.

'Wow I love it. I have just moved into a rental and want to do something similar,' said another.

A third added: 'Wow what a difference those baskets have made'.

Some asked whether she had been allowed to screw holes in the walls for mounted shelves but they came with the rental, so she wasn't sure.

There are different rules depending on your individual landlord so it's always best to check with them before you make any large changes to the structure of the house.
