Married At First Sight star Stacey Hampton has never been shy in flaunting her love for high-end fashion, often documenting her trips to Chanel and Gucci stores.

And now the 26-year-old is set to cash in on some of her most cherished items, having launched a new business where fans can rent out her distinctive garb.

Sharing the news to Instagram on Friday, the entrepreneur revealed items available range from dresses to blazers and bags, from the likes of Chanel, Balmain and Gucci.

'I'm in the process of actually getting all of my designer clothes and dresses and outfits ready to be hired out,' Stacey told fans in an Instagram Story clip early Friday.

The mother-of-two encouraged her fans to ask for specific items they're after, which she will happily buy and make available for hire.

'So if there's a Fendi dress that you're interested in and you can't quite get your hands on it, and if you want to loan it out, I'm happy to buy some items to add to the collection,' she said from inside her luxury vehicle.

Stacey is also hiring out her Zimmermann looks and bodycon dresses by British label House Of CB.  

For now, the business will solely run out of Adelaide, where Stacey is based, so she can avoid shipping amid the coronavirus pandemic.   

A black Balmain tweed blazer, retailing for $3030, can cost the average person $500 to hire, while a simple black Balmain T-shirt is available to rent for $60.
