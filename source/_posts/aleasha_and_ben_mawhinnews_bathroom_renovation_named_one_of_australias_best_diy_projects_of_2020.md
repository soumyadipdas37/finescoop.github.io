When Aleasha and Ben Mawhinnew started renovating the spare room of their New South Wales home in early 2020, they had no idea it would soon be named one of Australia's best DIY projects of the year.

After their six-year-old son Nate outgrew his nursery, the couple from Shellharbour, south of Wollongong on the NSW South Coast, decided to convert the space into a luxurious ensuite.

The result is a hotel-style bathroom - complete with a double shower, monochromatic tiles and a marble-top vanity - fitted with bargain buys from Kmart, Target and Bunnings that cost just $3,700 for everything from toilet to tapware.

Bunnings has featured the Mawhinnews handiwork in its roundup of 'Australia's best DIY projects of 2020', which recognises the country's greatest home transformations 'from simple makeovers to full-on renovations'.

The renovation completed by the Mawhinnews (pictured) has been named one of 'Australia's best DIY projects of 2020'

'It's everything we dreamed it would be, it says 'us' all over!' Ms Mawhinnew, a 31-year-old childcare teacher, told Daily Mail Australia.

She said the project took roughly six months to complete, with most of the work being done on weekends as the couple held down full-time jobs while chasing two lively children around.

'Two kids, work and life in general made it to tricky to complete,' Ms Mawhinnew said. 

Some of the heavy lifting was done with help from friend Jimmy, a plumber, and Ben's 'handyman' father Mark, but Ms Mawhinnew said her 32-year-old cabinet maker husband deserves credit for 'nearly all' of the renovation. 

Hexagon tiles, grouting, shower head and tapware, toilet, hand towel ring and toilet paper holder - $2,500 from Bunnings

Rectangular wall tiles - $300 from ColorTile Port Macquarie

Fan, wall light, hook and shower screen - $550 eBay 

Linen and soft furnishings - $200 from Spotlight

Bathroom accessories and toiletries - $50 from Woolworths 

Laundry basket - $50 from Target

Miscellaneous accessories - $50 from Kmart

Vanity - secondhand from Facebook marketplace (repainted)

Total: $3,700

'Ben has literally made my vision come to life and I am not only lucky to have such a hardworking husband and father to our kids, I'm so proud of what he has done,' she said.

Ms Mawhinnew was instrumental in the project too, finding a secondhand vanity for sale on Facebook marketplace and revamping it with forest green paint.

Over on social media, people were amazed at what the couple had achieved with such a reasonable budget.
