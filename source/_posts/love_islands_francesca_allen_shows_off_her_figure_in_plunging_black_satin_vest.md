She is the Love Island 2019 star who has an eye for great style. 

And Francesca Allen showed off her figure in a tight all-black ensemble as she headed to dinner at the Bluebird in Chelsea on Saturday night.  

The reality star, 24, looked stylish in a plunging black satin vest and flares as she stepped out with fellow Love Island alum Maria Wild.

She completed the going-out look with a black belt, black leather hand bag and chunky white trainers. 

Her brunette tresses were styled in soft waves while a radiant palette of make-up enhanced her pretty features.

Over the summer months Francesca enjoyed several holidays and her Instagram was littered with sizzling bikini snaps.  

Aside from her frequent getaways, Francesca was spotted cosying up to a new man during a boozy night out in London earlier this summer.

She looked to be on cloud nine as she got up close and personal with Edward Crossan, vice chairman of London-based waste management company Powerday.

The TV personality, who is family friends with Edward, put on a very affectionate display with the hunk who was previously been linked to TOWIE's Amber Turner. 

In May last year, Edward was seen enjoying a jaunt on a yacht in Ibiza with TOWIE star Amber, 27, who is currently dating Dan Edgar.

The accomplished businessman was named vice chairman of his father's company in January and is featured on the company's website.

Confident: The reality star looked in high spirits as she hit the town with her friend Maria 

His working title is described on the website as: 'Edward joined the family business in 2007, starting as a machine driver.

'He has worked in various roles within the company to now being a director overseeing the development of the business.' 

MailOnline contacted Francesca's representatives for further comment at the time of publication.
