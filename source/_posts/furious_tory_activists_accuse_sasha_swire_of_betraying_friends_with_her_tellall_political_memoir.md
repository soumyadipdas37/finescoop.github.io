The wife of ex-Minister Hugo Swire has been accused by furious Tory activists in his former constituency of 'betraying' friends with her indiscretion-heavy memoir.

Sasha Swire's tell-all book – Diary Of An MP's Wife: Inside And Outside Power – lifts the lid on sex and political shenanigans in the party, describing David Cameron as 'drunken Dave' with a filthy mouth, Boris Johnson as 'calculating' and Theresa May as a 'glumbucket'.

Lady Swire, 57, sent her diaries to a publisher last year after her husband retired as East Devon MP.

Last night Maddy Chapman, a Conservative district councillor there for 12 years, said local party members were 'absolutely disgusted' at the way she had breached the confidence of friends.

'She has shown herself for what she is,' said Mrs Chapman. 'She has absolutely no class whatsoever.

'This has not gone down at all well in the constituency. Everyone I speak to is less than impressed and some, including myself, are absolutely disgusted.

'Sasha Swire has never mixed within the local community, not even within our local party.

'I suspect a lot of people will be crossing the Swires off their Christmas card list.'

In Lady Swire's tell-all memoir, she reveals how David and Samantha Cameron drowned their sorrows following the Brexit vote.

She tells how, in the wake of the 2016 referendum, she visited the Camerons for a weekend at their Oxfordshire home. She claims that the then-Prime Minister asked her husband to bring 'two fat Cohibas [Cuban cigars] and plenty of booze' and was 'chomping on cigars' over 'endless bottles of wine'.

And she adds that Mrs Cameron had to muster up some Dutch courage before joining her husband for his resignation speech, feeling unable to do so 'without drinking a large negroni'.

She also says that Mr Cameron told her former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had a two-way mirror in his bedroom.

'I sit next to Dave at dinner,' she writes. 'He gives us wonderful vignettes of the Sarkozys' fake marital displays and of being given a tour around Rome's equivalent of No 10 by Berlusconi.

'When they come to his bedroom he points at a Renaissance two-way mirror above the bed and with his characteristic grin says, 'Well, they didn't have porn channels in those days, did they?' '

Of Boris Johnson, she is withering, writing: 'It scares the s*** out of me that people don't see [Mr Johnson] as the calculating machine he really is,' and she describes Mr Johnson's fiancee Carrie Symonds as his 'hot young vixen'.

She has nicknames for many senior Tories. Former Prime Minister Theresa May is 'Old Ma May', George Osborne is 'Boy George' while Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is 'Raab C Brexit'.

Mr Cameron has admitted the diaries, due out next week, were 'kind of embarrassing'.
