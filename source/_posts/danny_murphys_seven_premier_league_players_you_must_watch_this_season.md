The new Premier League season is almost immediately back upon us, with new faces gracing the division either as freshly signed arrivals or promoted battlers.

Big names in the division will have a point to prove to reassert their dominance, while plucky upstarts will be determined to carve out reputations for themselves.

As England's top flight prepares to grace our screens once more, Sportsmail's DANNY MURPHY highlights the seven players you must keep your eyes on this season... 

Looks a future superstar. The most natural finisher in English football I’ve seen since Robbie Fowler, the ability to strike the ball so cleanly with either foot gives him a great advantage, and defenders don’t know which way to show him.

He can do a good job on the right but ultimately he’ll end up as Manchester United’s centre-forward.

Mason Greenwood's finishing is praised by all and he looks a superstar in the making

This is his big moment — filling the shoes of David Silva. Of all the outstanding youngsters in English football, Foden still stands out because of the way he glides past defenders so effortlessly. City made a decision not to loan him out because they felt training every day with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne would derive the greatest benefit. Potential world-beater.

Arsenal’s need to be prudent in the transfer market has meant their youngsters have been given a go, and Saka is the pick of an outstanding bunch. The confidence and composure he shows at 18, in a number of different positions, is incredible. Deservedly nominated as PFA Young Player of the Year, and he will get better.

Just because we always look for the next big thing, doesn’t mean we should take for granted great players like Salah. 

A Champions League and Premier League winner, I imagine the Egyptian King now wants his Golden Boot back having loaned it out to Jamie Vardy. 

At 28, he should be at his absolute peak, and with a sharp new haircut as well.

Mo Salah will be desperate to reclaim his golden boots and hit even greater heights this year

Most exciting of the summer signings so far. At 21, Havertz has already shown his quality in the Champions League with Bayer Leverkusen and for Germany. 

An attacking midfield player with a great left foot, Havertz scored 18 goals last season.

I wonder if Frank Lampard saw a bit of himself in there. Chelsea fans are in for a treat.

Youngster Kai Havertz is hugely exciting but will have pressure on him to perform at Chelsea

I played at the base of midfield for a good part of my career so I appreciate the job he does for Leeds protecting the defence but then having the vision to start attacks going the other way. What I like about Phillips (below) is his ability to sense danger so he can react and intervene before his side are under pressure. Not everyone asked to play holding midfield has that.

It usually takes players, particularly strikers, a season to get used to the Premier League so McBurnie’s impact was impressive and I expect even more from the 24-year-old this time. McBurnie epitomises the work ethic of Chris Wilder’s side and is strong in the air. It’s a good habit to score against top teams as he did against Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham.
