She's long been known for her eye-catching sense of style.

And Irina Shayk even managed to turn heads on her way to the airport in Milan on Wednesday, as she ditched her signature heels for a pair of comfy black trainers.

The model, 34, opted for maroon co-ords as she arrived to catch her flight out of the Italian city, but removed her green stilettos before heading into the terminal.

Irina cut a stylish figure as she arrived at the airport in her deep red shirt and trousers combo, which had a light sheen thanks to sparkling threaded detailing.

The mother-of-one opted for narrow-framed sunglasses as she arrived to catch her flight.

While she arrived in contrasting green heels with a knotted detailing, Irina later changed into chunky black trainers for a comfortable walk to her flight.

Irina shares 50/50 joint legal and physical custody of her daughter Lea, three, with her ex-partner Bradley Cooper, according to TMZ. 

And while Shayk and Cooper officially ended their four-year romance in June 2019, the amicable exes were spotted embracing each other on September 8. 

Cooper is on break from filming his role as Barbra Streisand's hairdresser-turned-movie producer Jon Peters in Paul Thomas Anderson's untitled seventies San Fernando Valley-set flick. 

The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.

New man? Meanwhile Irina has been spotted several times with her potential new boyfriend Vito Schnabel, who is a longtime pal and previously dated Heidi Klum

'There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she's back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March. 

'He's been making an effort to take projects that aren't too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he's very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he'd carry her everywhere.'

'He's totally devoted to Lea, it's really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on. 

Bradley been back in NYC after spending time in Southern California shooting a yet-to-be-titled Paul Thomas Anderson film.

Meanwhile Irina has been spotted several times with her potential new boyfriend Vito Schnabel, who is a longtime pal and previously dated Heidi Klum.
