She has kept her baby girl's name a secret for the past week.

But on Tuesday, radio host Ash Pollard shared all the details of her newborn's unexpected arrival.

'I went in for a vaginal birth and I ended up having an emergency C-section. It was an absolute ordeal,' she told Hit NSW Breakfast's Gawndy and Maz.

Lovely! Ash Pollard has revealed the name of her baby daughter: Clementine Abigail Ferne. Pictured after giving birth last week

'I had to be induced, which means they technically induce your body to make you go into labour and then that wasn't working,' she added. 

'I was in labour for two days.' 

The 34-year-old revealed she felt emotionless and spaced out when Clementine Abigail Ferne arrived on September 21 because she 'was on so many drugs'.

Ash said that she and her partner, Pete Ferne, had decided on the name after considering several options, which included 'Fergus' for a boy.

'It's real... I promise!' she laughed when asked about the unusual name suggestion.

'Do you know what the craziest thing is... you don't have to think of a name for your child for 60 days,' she added. 

 Ash also revealed that she did not cry when Clementine was born, but Pete did.

He was by her side from the very start of the 48-hour labour, even though he felt 'helpless' in the situation.

'You know what's funny... no matter how much a guy reads a book or their mates tell them about something, you will just feel so helpless,' she said.

'Pete was doing all the right things but when you're in the middle of labour and having these contractions that are so effing hectic, you can't do anything.'

The only thing Pete was able to do for Ash was cut the umbilical cord when Clementine finally arrived.

'I shouted over the curtain that separates me and my operation, "Have you sewn me up yet? Put me back together and get me out of here!"' Ash laughed.

Out and about: The couple have spent the past week settling into parenthood, with Ash taking her baby girl for a stroll near their home on the NSW Central Coast on Monday

The outing came just hours after viewers watched the former MKR star bare all for a good cause on The All New Monty: Guys & Gals on Sunday night.

The burlesque show, which was filmed at Sydney's Enmore Theatre in March, raised awareness of early detection and prevention of cancer.

It was filmed about the same time Ash discovered she was pregnant.
