Director Eli Russell Linnetz leaked a bizarre three year old music video for Feel Me, Kanye West's 2017 track with Tyga, on Wednesday. 

The racy video sees Kim Kardashian, 39, and younger sister Kylie Jenner, 20, parading around in barely-there thongs and stripper heels while a Calabasas monster truck cruises around.

Reportedly costing a million dollars to make, the video ends with a truly disturbing scene of Kim with her legs spread, seemingly giving birth to an adult Kylie. Shortly after it was released, the video was removed from Linnetz's YouTube page. 

What is happening? A bizarre three year old music video for Kanye West's track Feel Me features a scene where Kim Kardashian  seemingly gives birth to an adult Kylie Jenner was leaked on Wednesday

In the video, Kim and Kylie look unlike their usual raven haired selves, both sporting blonde hair.

Kylie's transformation was the most dramatic as the then 20-year-old donned a platinum pixie cut wig in a style similar to what her mom Kris Jenner prefers.

The cosmetics mogul was styled for the Feel Me in a cheeky pair of silver thong panties with a thin matching crop top that left little to the imagination.

Her editorial style makeup highlighted Kylie's enhanced pout with a matte nude lipstick and her eyeshadow was done up to her brows in an icy sky blue.

Art house: Kim rocked a 'wet look' with her long blonde bob in the moody video

The video begins with Kylie stepping onto a dark, muddy race track while a monster truck with 'Calabasas' written on the side skids around in circles. 

Linnetz shot the sisters to look like giants, walking among the track - so big they can pick up the truck in their hands.

Both Kylie and Kim were dressed in platform stiletto perspex heels, commonly dubbed 'stripper heels.'

The youngest Kardashian Jenner sibling leaned into the highly sexualized vibe of the moody, dark video and showcased her ample assets in slow moving drops to the ground. 

Wow: Kim Kardashian was dressed even more risque than her younger sister and sported a black G-string with a matching bra

At the time that the video was filmed, Kylie was in a relationship with rapper Tyga, who is featured on her brother-in-law's track. 

The director said in an interview with E! News on Wednesday that their romance fizzling went into the decision not to release the video previously.

'The video was shot over five months but was never released because Kylie and Tyga broke up,' he explained. 

The celebrity couple dated from 2014-2017. Tyga shares his son King with ex-Blac Chyna who also has a daughter, Dream, with Kylie's brother Rob Kardashian.

Way back when: At the time that the video was filmed, Kylie was in a relationship with rapper Tyga, who is featured on her brother-in-law's track

Where has it been?The director said in an interview with E! News on Wednesday that Kyle and Tyga's break up was part of the reason that the video never came out 

Kim Kardashian was dressed even more risque than her younger sister and sported a black G-string with a matching bra.

Like Kylie, Kim put her famous bottom on display in a series of seemingly endless slow-motion squats. 

The mother of four's blonde hair was cut into a long bob and she rocked a 'wet look' style with the cornsilk tresses seemingly soaked. 

Perspective: Linnetz shot the sisters to look like giants, walking among the track - so big they can pick up the truck in their hands

A labor: The director said that the artsy work took an astounding five months to shoot

Fit fiend: Kim put her incredibly fit figure on display in the video for her husband Kanye, whom she married in 2014

At the end of the video, there is a disturbing scene of a giant Kim seated with her legs spread in the Lucite heels while a door opens where her vagina would be.

She is stylized as some sort of deity with giant angel wings floating out from behind her back.

Out of the door comes a blinding white light and scantily clad Kylie Jenner as if Kim birthed her.

At first glance it looked like Kylie was birthing herself but the director confirmed it was Kim and explained his artistic decision.

Issues: Shortly after Feel Me was leaked on Linnetz's YouTube page, it was removed

What's the deal? The vibe was described but the director as 'the visual smashing of American iconography, man made machinery battling man-made women'

History: Linnetz has worked with Yeezus rapper in the past and directed videos for his songs Famous and Fade

'It features Kylie coming out of Kim's vagina,' he said told E! News. 'The metaphorical meaning being that there would be no Kylie without Kim.' 

The rhetoric that the ultra famous Kardashian family wouldn't be so without Kim is a common refrain. 

Kim actually once screamed at older sister Kourtney during an episode of Keeping Up the Kardashian's about giving her 'a f**king career.'

Metaphors: Out of the door comes a blinding white light and scantily clad Kylie Jenner as if Kim birthed her

'It features Kylie coming out of Kim's vagina,' he said told E! News. 'The metaphorical meaning being that there would be no Kylie without Kim.'

Linnetz has a long history of working with the Yeezus rapper in the past and directed videos for his songs Famous and Fade. 

He is also the creative director for Lady Gaga. 

Ironically, West and Tyga were barely featured in the video for Feel Me. The vibe was described but the director as 'the visual smashing of American iconography, man made machinery battling man-made women.' 



Resume: Eli Linnetz also serves as Lady Gaga's creative director
