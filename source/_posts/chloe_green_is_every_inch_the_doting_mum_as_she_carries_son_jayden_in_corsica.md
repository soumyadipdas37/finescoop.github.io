Chloe Green was seen enjoying a low-key stroll with her son Jayden Meeks-Green, two, and her new boyfriend Manuele Thiella, 34, in Corsica on Monday. 

The Topshop heiress, 29, looked radiant in a tiered floral maxi dress paired with comfortable trainers as she held her son on her hip. 

Jayden's father is 'Hot Felon' Jeremy Meeks, who Chloe split from in June 2019, before going public with Italian yacht broker Manuele earlier this year.

Chloe looked stunning in her elegant dress as she walked along looking every inch the doting mother with Jayden poised on her hip.

She opted for comfort for the outing as she rocked Converse style trainers which provided a contrasting style to the floaty dress.

Wearing her long blonde locks in loose waves falling from a centre parting, she perfected her beach babe look on yet another sunny jaunt.  

Looking dashing as ever, Manuele was hot on her heels in a stylish summer look complete with yellow shorts and a loose-fitting white tee.

Chloe split from ex-fiancé Jeremy, 36, nicknamed Hot Felon, in June 2019, following a two-year romance.
