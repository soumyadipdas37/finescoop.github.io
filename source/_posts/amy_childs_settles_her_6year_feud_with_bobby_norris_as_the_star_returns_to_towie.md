Shockingly, Amy revealed she had been accused of not loving her son as much due to the decision. 

She explained: 'He is a beautiful little boy, he is like a mini-me and of course I love him every bit as much as Polly. Polly has a different dad and I made different decision with Polly and it is that simple.

'It was a hard decision because I don't want Ritchie or Polly to grow up and say why did you do that with me and not my brother and sister.

'All the constant messages questioning my love for Ritchie does get me down though because I love my children exactly the same.'

Amy has protected Ritchie's privacy so fiercely that his name was not even revealed until March this year, when she accidentally let it slip in an interview.  

Meanwhile, although Amy has insisted she would never pressure Polly to follow in her footsteps with a career in reality television, she mused, 'I think she is made for TV'. 

TOWIE returns on Sunday September 20 at 9pm on ITVBe.
