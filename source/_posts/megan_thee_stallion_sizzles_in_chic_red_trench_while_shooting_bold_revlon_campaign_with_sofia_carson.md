Megan Thee Stallion put her best face forward while shooting a dazzling commercial for Revlon this past Tuesday in New York.

The WAP rapper, 25, looked red hot as she worked the cameras wearing a shiny crimson trench coat.

Opposite the Texas native was Descendants actress Sofia Carson, 27, who oozed elegance in a sexy black tuxedo look.

Megan - given name Megan Jovon Ruth Pete - continued her sassy look wearing stockings emblazoned with the Revlon name. Tiny gold elements like a necklace and hoops tied things together along with an array of icy rings.

She had her hair slicked back and twisted into a long braid down her back, making sure her makeup look took center stage.  

And the shimmering bronze eyes and a dark burgundy lip certainly made an impression.

Sofia was equally as radiant, rocking a sharp jacket with dramatic shoulder pads. Offering a hint of cleavage, she donned a bustier underneath.

'The whole concept of this campaign fits so well with the Hot Girl lifestyle; having fun, being confident, living your truth, and, most important, living boldly.'

But makeup hasn't been the only thing on Megan's mind.
