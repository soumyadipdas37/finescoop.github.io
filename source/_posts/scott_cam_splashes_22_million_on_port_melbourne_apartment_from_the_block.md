He's the humble TV tradesman who has been quietly building a multi-million dollar property empire.  

And Scott Cam has lifted the lid on one of his little-known purchases - an Art Deco apartment in Port Melbourne that was renovated on The Block in 2016. 

The 57-year-old, who has hosted The Block for a decade, secretly splashed $2.2 million on the bolthole in 2017, and lives there for four months of the year. 

 'It was a no-brainer!' Scott Cam, 57, has revealed he quietly splashed $2.2 million on a lavish Port Melbourne apartment from The Block in 2017 

The apartment is located inside the former J. Kitchen & Sons Art Deco soap factory, and was renovated as part of a challenge on The Block. 

'I loved this building so much I wanted to buy one of the apartments,' Scott told The Herald Sun this weekend.   

The apartment, which was built as part of a challenge on the show, wasn't auctioned off during The Block's finale, but rather was placed on the market after the show had wrapped.

'When it became available I said 'yes' and went to the bank and said can I borrow some money, I want to buy one of these things,' he explained. 

'To me it is a no-brainer buying a Block house,' said Scott.

Scott boasts an impressive property portfolio, including a lavish $6.5 million trophy home in Sydney's exclusive suburb of Vaucluse.

The Channel Nine star purchased the Mediterranean-style mansion for $4.6million in 2012, and it is now believed to be worth at least $6million.  

The property has become the perfect family home for Scott, his wife Ann Cam and their three children, Sarah, Charlie and Bill.

Other properties include a $2 million renovated home in Rosebery, a coastal residence at Narrawallee on the NSW South Coast and a property at a farm near Mudgee.
