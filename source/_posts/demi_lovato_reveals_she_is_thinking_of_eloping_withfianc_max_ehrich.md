Demi Lovato has revealed that she is thinking of eloping with fiancé Max Ehrich.

The Sorry Not Sorry hitmaker, 28, admitted that she is unable to have the huge celebration she wants with her friends and family due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

Demi, who announced she was engaged to actor Max, 29, in July after four months of dating, shared that she wants their wedding to be 'sacred' between them.

Discussing their upcoming nuptials, she told Popcrush Nights: 'On one hand, I would love to elope because my life is so public and I want to keep it sacred between me and him. 

'On the other hand, I want my friends and family to be there for a celebration. But I can't do that until the pandemic's over because it's not safe.

'It's like, do we do that [elope] in the meantime and do that [a big wedding ceremony] later? It's all this planning.'

Demi also revealed that she has started looking at wedding dresses and teased that it is 'definitely not' a traditional white gown.

She continued: 'I have my image for what I would want it to [look like] if I got to do a big celebration. I don't wanna give it away but it's definitely not a white dress.'

The interview comes after Demi took to Instagram on Sunday to seemingly debunk a slew of viral screenshots that showed rude tweets made by Max in 2015. 

'It's really sad when people FAKE images to put women against each other. If women have conflict that's between them NOT YOU,' said the 28-year-old pop star in her passionate rant.  

In the 'fake' tweets, Max allegedly wrote that Lovato's former best friend Selena Gomez, 28, was 'prettier' and more vocally gifted that her.

Selena is, clearly, a touchy subject for Demi, being that the pair have endured a rocky friendship since rising to fame on Disney Channel in the mid-2000s.

Lovato opened up about their crumbling friendship in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in May.

'When you grow up with somebody, you're always going to have love for them. But I'm not friends with her, so it felt….I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best,' she explained.

Elsewhere, Demi announced she was engaged to actor Max in July after four months of dating.

The pair's romance was first confirmed when Demi - who previously dated model Austin Wilson - accidentally crashed Max's Instagram Live session.

And sources later revealed that they had decided to quarantine together at Demi's house amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
