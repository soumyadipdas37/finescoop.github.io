Liam Hemsworth's good looks have gained him a legion of fans across the globe.

And the 30-year-old proved he can still turn heads away from the spotlight, as he went about his business grocery shopping near his Byron Bay home. 

On Wednesday, the chiselled hunk cut a casual figure after he was spotted carrying meat and barbecue supplies to his car in the NSW coastal paradise.

Liam was possibly spending time with his famous brother Chris and his wife Elsa Pataky, with the family likely planning a barbecue.  

Meanwhile, Liam's ex-wife Miley Cyrus recently hinted that she could be on the hunt for another Australian boyfriend in the near future.

Speaking to The Kyle and Jackie O Show this month, the 27-year-old admitted that she was keen to go 'shopping' for an Aussie bloke once the coronavirus restrictions are lifted.

When asked about her relationship status, she told The Kyle and Jackie O Show this month: 'I haven't been to Australia and been able to go shopping in a while, so next time I'm there...'.

Not understanding the reference, co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson responded: 'Oh, the shopping here is great, isn't it?'

Without skipping a beat, Kyle said: 'No darl, she's talking about d**k there, not actually shopping.'  

Former flames: The songstress rebounded with Australian singer-songwriter Cody Simpson. They dated for less than a year before calling it quits in early August

Miley was famously married to Liam Hemsworth, but the couple split for good in 2019.

After their split, the songstress rebounded with Australian singer-songwriter Cody Simpson. They dated for less than a year before calling it quits in early August.

Liam has since moved on with model Gabriella Brooks, 24, who he has been dating for about nine months.

'Liam and Gabriella are really close and feel comfortable with one another. They connect over important topics and share the same values about family and life,' an alleged source told Us Weekly.
