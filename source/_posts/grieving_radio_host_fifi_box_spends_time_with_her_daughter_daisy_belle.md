The radio host, who shared a close bond with Jaimi despite splitting from Grant eight years ago, posted a series of photos of her daughter Trixie with her older half-sister to Instagram.

'The loss of such a beautiful loving sister and friend is suffocating. We laughed, we cried, we shared so many wonderful memories that I will keep alive for Trixie who loved her big sister so much, her little heart is broken,' she wrote.

'You loved Trixie with all your heart and she felt every inch of your love. With every tight squeezy cuddle your love poured into her,' she added.

The 43-year-old media personality continued: 'We were so blessed to have you in our lives. You were such a true and loyal friend, we love you so much and can't bear the pain of you not being here.' 

Jaimi was the older half-sister of Fifi's daughter Trixie, who she welcomed in 2013 after a brief relationship with Grant.

Despite splitting with Grant months before giving birth, Fifi remained close to his children Jaimi, Morgan and Jett from his first marriage to Australian swimming legend Lisa Curry.

Break: Fifi had also been absent from Fox FM's Fifi, Fev and Byron radio show on Tuesday and Wednesday morning

Jaimi would even babysit Trixie on occasion while single mum Fifi was at work. 

Jaimi's mother, three-time Olympian Lisa Curry, separated from Grant in 2009 after 23 years of marriage, before finalising their divorce in 2017. 

Fifi and Grant dated for several months in 2012, but had broken up by the time she welcomed daughter Beatrix 'Trixie' Belle via IVF the following year.

She did not acknowledge Grant was Trixie's father until 2016, when she shared a photo to Instagram of the retired athlete attending their child's third birthday party.

In June 2019, Fifi welcomed another daughter, Daisy Belle, via IVF and an anonymous donor. The identity of Daisy's father is not public knowledge.

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement by Jaimi's father, Grant.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child.

'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us the extra time we were able to spend with her.

'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'
