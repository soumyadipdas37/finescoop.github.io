Australian YouTube beauty star Chloe Morello has shared the very simple makeup routine she swears by for looking 'glam' in just five minutes.

The 29-year-old vlogger - who now lives in Los Angeles - used just eight beauty products to perfect her look.

She said her 'time saving hack' is perfect for 'lazy' people or those with minimal time on their hands to get ready so they could be out the door in just minutes.

'So I really want to look glam and done up but I want it to take about five minutes and I want it to be really simple and easy,' Chloe said in her latest YouTube video.

Shiseido: Syncro Skin Foundation '230'

Fenty Beauty: Sponge 

Glossier Boy Brow: 'Brunette' 

Salt New York: Creme Tint Pro 'Pearl' 'Beige' 'Light' 'Raspberry' 'Wine' 

Giorgio Armani: Eyes To Kill Pencil 

Marc Jacobs: At Lash'd Mascara 

Sweed Lashes: 'Nikki Corner' 

Ouai: Dry Shampoo

After moisturising her skin, Chloe - who has more than 2.6 subscribers - starts by applying foundation with a beauty sponge.

'The first thing that I would do is use foundation and I'm just going to use a sponge because I feel like that's pretty much the quickest way to go,' Chloe said.

'It's going to be simple but I'm not going to miss out any of my favourite steps. I often just think it's the choice of product that helps you save time.'

For eyebrows, she used a tinted gel with fibers so you get 'colour, fullness and hold in the same one step'.

'Brush them up. I used to pencil my eyebrows in a lot more than I do these days now that I've perfected my shape and grow my eyebrows out, I can be nice and quick with that,' she said.

Next, she uses a 'full face palette', in which she customised for herself.

'It has everything - bronzer, blush, lips and cheeks all in this one palette,' she said.

'Because everything's in the one palette, it really cuts down time.'

Using her fingers, she dabbed highlighter to her eyelids as her eyeshadow then she used a rose blush on her cheeks. 

'Honestly at this point in my life, fingers are just the fastest, easiest way,' she said.

She dabbed highlighter to her cheeks before applying a pencil eyeliner to her eyes.

'A pencil eyeliner is a lot more forgiving than liquid or gel or anything like that,' she said.

'This one's not waterproof so I can smudge it out at any point because there's cream on my eye. It's really easy to blend... it's really easy to manipulate, you do just have to be diligent because it will obviously crease if you didn't put primer on.'

For mascara, she used a product that's 'really lengthening and doesn't clump easily'.

Next, Chloe applied false lashes but she said this step is optional for everyone.

'I know this might not be the same for all of you but over the years, I've become a pro at applying lashes, I can put them on in seconds,' she said. 

'To save yourself time when trying to stick them to your eye, I like to give them a little stretch, a little workout so they're really flexible when I stick them on my eyelid.

'False eyelashes give you the winged eye effect and also help you in getting your eyeliner straight.'

She uses the pencil eyeliner to press the false lashes down before applying an under eye concealer that 'illuminates' and it's 'super handbag friendly' so she can keep in her handbag for touch-ups during the day.

Chloe then applies a 'little bit of mascara' on her false lashes to 'marry the lashes'.

'I'm gonna focus on the inner part where my natural lashes meet the inner corner of the false ones,' she said.

She then mixes to lip shades to create a lip colour for her lips. 

'I'm going to take what's left, put that over my cheeks so that my lips and cheeks match. Using my finger to soften out that edge because this is more of a tint and if it's too crisp it's going to be like an effort to touch up later,' she said.

She applies bronzer to her cheeks before lightly dusting powder on her T-zone. She finishes her look by spraying dry shampoo through her hair.

'And that is it, very quick, very simple - easy makeup look that still looks a little bit glam. It's perfect for busy parents, it's perfect for lazy girls like me and it's perfect for people like after work or trying to get ready in the car.

'I feel like you could easily get this done in five minutes and you would only have to pack like a couple of products.'
