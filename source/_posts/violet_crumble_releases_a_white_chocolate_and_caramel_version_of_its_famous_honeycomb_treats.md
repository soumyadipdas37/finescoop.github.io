Violet Crumble has released a white chocolate caramel version of its iconic honeycomb treat and shoppers are already scrambling to get their hands on a packet.

South Australian confectioner Robern Menz came up with the idea for a caramel addition after conducting a survey with customers.

They found that 28 per cent of Australians liked the idea of a caramelised white chocolate flavour combination - so they moved quickly with Violet Crumble Caramel.

'It's been a challenging year for all Australians, to say the least, and we know that our sweet flavour combinations offer some satisfying relief and escapism, bringing some fun back into the day and shattering cravings,' CEO of Robern Menz Phil Sims said.

'When we first trialled the new flavour combo we instantly knew we were on to something. You bite into that smooth caramel flavour, followed by the shattering sharpness of the honeycomb and it smells incredible.'

Shoppers have been posting pictures of the new packaging, with some saying they have already melted them down to make a cake with the 'bites'.

'I got them last week! OMG they are so delicious,' one enthusiastic person wrote on Facebook.

'I must try them. They look really sweet,' said another. 

The company introduced Violet Crumble Dark to the masses last year - to high acclaim - and Violet Crumble has also been released as nuggets, an Easter egg and even a Gaytime ice cream. 

'When we first trialled the new flavour combo we instantly knew we were on to something,' Phil Sims (pictured) said

Robern Menz brought the Violet Crumble brand back to Australian production and ownership in 2018

Robern Menz brought the Violet Crumble brand back to Australian production and ownership in 2018.

'When we took ownership of Violet Crumble, and began producing it here in Australia, we had the freedom to innovate and trial different formats and flavours of the iconic bar to appeal to constantly evolving trends, and with caramel we really did it, we're onto a winner,' Mr Sims said.

The new flavour will be available nationally in Woolworths stores and online for $4.40 a bag.
