Posting a sweet selfie with her daughter and her new night light, the actress, 27, revealed she would be heading back to school in the coming days, and despite her fears she's still proud of her little girl 'every day.'

She reassured them that it wasn't coronavirus, as she said: 'I've come over unwell. Not corona, sick. So I'm just in bed trying to recover.' 

Jacqueline and Dan have just returned from a sun-soaked holiday in Greece and seem to be happier than ever.

'Any more reasons you need? You didn't know none of that, eh? That's because you do not f***ing know me, or my wife, or us as a couple lol.

'So concentrate on your own life and you (sic) clearly never been taught to not be rude, especially to people you don't even know. Hope you've learnt something from this.'

The response stemmed from a post Jacqueline shared the previous day of herself and husband Dan, urging him to 'hurry home please' amid his Turkey trip.
