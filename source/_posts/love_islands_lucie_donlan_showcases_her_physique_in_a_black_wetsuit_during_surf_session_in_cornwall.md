She rose to fame after appearing on the fifth season of Love Island.

And Lucie Donlan looked incredible as she took to the waves for a fun surf session in Newquay, Cornwall on Wednesday.

The surfer, 21, showcased her toned physique in a form-fitting black wetsuit as she happily rode the waves.

Lucie wowed as she displayed her tanned, slender pins as she walked along the beach before wading into the sea.

The reality starlet allowed her blonde curls to cascade over her shoulders, while she went make-up free for the day.

Lucie later dried off and slipped into a white crop top and slouchy white jogging bottoms, showcasing her washboard abs as she did so.

The beauty looked content as she strolled along, with her surfboard tucked under her arm.

Lucie's outing comes after she went public with her Love Island beau Luke at the start of July.

Soon after the announcement, Luke branded the surfer his 'partner in crime' in a sweet social media post.

The former heating engineer and the model looked loved-up as they shared a hug on the beach during a romantic surfing trip in Yorkshire.

Luke and Lucie sported matching wetsuits as they put on a cosy display in the image uploaded to the hunk's platform, which he captioned: 'My partner in crime.'

The surfer commented: 'Youuuu' with a heart-eyed emoji, while fellow Love Islander Luke Trotman, who confirmed the pair's romance days earlier, cheekily wrote: 'Double date but no surfing.' (sic) 

Just hours after going Instagram official, the Luke's ex-girlfriend Demi Jones – who he was partnered up with on Love Island's winter 2020 series – appeared to make a thinly-veiled dig at her co-star as she liked a tweet about being 'better off alone'.
