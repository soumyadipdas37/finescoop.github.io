She's in Byron Bay to film for the drama series, Nine Perfect Strangers.

And Samara Weaving appeared to have gone over the top with her spray tan as she left a beauty salon in the famous coastal town on Sunday.

The 28-year-old actress sported an incredibly deep tan, shades darker than her normal complexion.

 Samara's spray tan will undoubtedly develop into a lovely bronzed glow when she washes it off after a few hours.

The former soap star wore a baggy slogan tee and loose-fitting bottoms to avoid the unnecessary transfer of her newly applied tan.

Samara tied her blonde tresses into a low ponytail and added to the off-duty look with a baseball cap.

The denim coat that she was seen wearing ahead of her appointment was draped across her arm as she exited the beauty salon.

The star is in town to film Nine Perfect Strangers - a series based on the book by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty.

The series will see the rising star appear on-screen alongside actors Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy, Michael Shannon and Bobby Cannavale.

Hollywood took note last year when Samara starred alongside the likes of Adam Brody and Andie MacDowell in horror Ready Or Not - a role for which she won acclaim.

Together: Samara was joined by her fiance Jimmy Warden during the outing

Her performance as the bride fighting for her life in a deadly game of hide-and-seek had producers scrambling to cast her in Scream 5.

However, while speaking to Collider on Friday, Samara revealed the reason she had to turn down the exciting role.

'We talked about it a lot, but unfortunately, because of scheduling, I couldn't do it,' she said.
