'Freedom exists in so many different forms. But we are so blessed to be in a household where we have free children,' Union said. 

We have a daughter that is almost two, that the world has seen is bound to nothing but whatever is in her heart and on her soul at the moment. And it's beautiful to watch truly free children,' she added. 

'We have another daughter who's 13, who has the freedom to be exactly who she is, who she was born to be, to be her most authentic self. She doesn't ask permission to exist. That is wildly inspiring,' Union added.

Union was referring to her daughter Zaya, who, at just 12 years of age, came out as transgender and changed her name to Zaya, and both parents have been incredibly supportive along the way. 

'To echo my wife, we're inspired by our kids. The way they look at us, the way they look to us for leadership, for guidance, for that moment of bravery,' Wade said.

Legend also expanded his thoughts in a brief essay for Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People list

'Every kid is going to be different in some way or another. Every kid is going to have their own individuality and their own interests and their own identity,' Legend said.

'He and Gabrielle don’t love Zaya despite who she is. They love Zaya, and they celebrate who she is and they embrace her,' the singer added.

'He’s modeling how parents can champion their kids, and fight for them, and help them become the best adult that they can be. I think that’s really beautiful.
