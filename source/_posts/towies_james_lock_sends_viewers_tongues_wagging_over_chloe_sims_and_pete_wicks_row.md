 Chloe Sims and Pete Wicks' mysterious row sent tongues wagging on TOWIE on Sunday night, after James Lock backtracked on calling it a 'lovers' tiff'. 

The pair fell out eight months ago but have yet to reveal the cause of why their friendship broke down.

After James' comment and the pair agreeing to go to couples' therapy, viewers flooded Twitter raising theories Chloe, 35, and Pete, 31, were more than BFFs before their bitter feud. 

More than friends? Chloe Sims and Pete Wicks' mysterious row sent tongues wagging on TOWIE on Sunday night, after James Lock backtracked on calling it a 'lovers' tiff'

Meeting James, 33, at the pub after his run-in with the reality star, Pete said: 'I bumped into Chloe, it was f*****g awkward. But she was smiling.'

James replied: 'She misses ya, she loves ya. I know Chloe she would never hear a bad word said about you and you're the same.

'You had a lovers tiff', before he awkwardly added: 'not a lovers tiff, friendship tiff'.

MailOnline has contacted Pete and Chloe's representatives for comment. 

Fans of the show took to Twitter after the interaction. One wrote: 'See James let that slip "lovers".'

Another viewer added: 'Come on it's a lovers' tiff. A friendship where feelings were caught or maybe a FWB situation that became more than that'.

'When are Pete and Chloe going to swallow they're pride and admit there's more than friendship between them', tweeted a different fan. 

'Omg can these two get together already please', another chimed. 'What did Lockie say sorry?,' another fan wrote.

Earlier in the episode Chloe and Pete finally shared their first chat.

Pete kick-started the tense conversation by asking if there's 'anything' Chloe would like to say. 

Chloe responded: 'Not really, I don't wanna be rude in front of Peggy [Pete's dog], but you were a bit of an a***hole. 

'Towards the end of our friendship I felt like you started dismissing my feelings and … are you going to look at me or are you going to look at the bush? 

Not impressed: Chloe called Pete an 'a***hole' during their first chat after falling out eight months ago earlier on in the episode

'I feel like you were dismissing how I felt a lot, I've confided in you, I've told you everything and told you all my secrets... and I know I'm a lot. 

'I know I can be clingy and I can be jealous that is who I am, so if you don't like those things then we can't be friends cause I'm not going to change, I am who I am.'

Pete then tried to interject, telling Chloe to 'hold on, hold on', but to no avail as she continued to explain how she was feeling. 

Defiant: Pete listened as Chloe said: 'I know I can be clingy and I can be jealous that is who I am, so if you don't like those things then we can't be friends cause I'm not going to change'

'No, I'm getting to my point,' she told him firmly. 'Obviously when the pandemic happened I just thought "omg I need Pete, I need to talk to Pete".' 

Pete then asked his former close pal, 'so why didn't ya?' with Chloe replying she 'didn't know if you would be there even if I did reach out'. 

He then asked her the ultimatum: 'Do you want to be friends then or civil?', to which Chloe said after a prolonged pause: 'Friends'.  

Having it out: Chloe accused Pete of 'dismissing her feelings' during the confrontation 

They later met up at a bar. Chloe said: 'I'm really glad that we broke the ice, obviously we were having a bit of stand off.  

'The thing is when I see you, it's just you and it's familiar and all of the things I'm p****d off about go away. In reality you did p**s me off but I don't want to do it again.'

Pete told her: 'I don't want to do the rowing.' 

Chloe said: Maybe we got so close. It felt like you were treating me different to how you were treating other people.'

Pere admitted: 'I probably treat the people closest to me worst and you know that,' before suggesting the pair go to couples' therapy.

Smiling with glee, Chloe said she 'would love that' because he would be able to understand her perspective.  

TOWIE continues on ITVBe at 9pm on Wednesday.  

'I would love that': Chloe later agreed to go to couples therapy with Pete to heal their friendship
