Christmas Abbott sobbed after nominating Da'Vonne Rogers and Bayleigh Dayton for eviction on Sunday's episode of Big Brother: All-Stars on CBS.

The 38-year-old Head of Household revealed her picks at the end of the one-hour episode that also featured the debut of the Big Brother Basement.

Christmas during the nomination ceremony told Da'Vonne, 32, and Bayleigh, 27, that it wasn't personal after putting them both up for eviction.

'I have nominated you, Bayleigh and you, Da'Vonne,' she told them during the group meeting. 'Bayleigh, you let me know that Da'Vonne was your untouchable. That is a pretty significant thing to say in this game. I really pray that you guys see that this is not personal and I want to respect you both by giving you both an opportunity to play in the veto.'

Da'Vonne immediately sought clarification from Christmas about her reasoning.

'You nominated me because I'm her untouchable?,' she asked Christmas.

'Yes,' Christmas confirmed before adjourning the meeting.

Bayleigh admitted her disappointment.

'Being next to my best friend in the house sucks, but I knew they would come for us. I just didn't think they would be bold enough to actually do it,' she said in a confessional.

Christmas meanwhile was in tears over her decision as she wept alone in the kitchen.

Bold move: 'Being next to my best friend in the house sucks, but I knew they would come for us. I just didn't think they would be bold enough to actually do it,' Bayleigh said in a confessional

'You do these moves that have to be done for the purpose of the game, but it just rips your heart in half and it just really hurts,' Christmas said crying in a confessional.

Da'Vonne and Bayleigh both vowed to win the power of veto and stay in the game.

The episode opened with Christmas celebrating after being crowned the new Head of Household.

'I'm officially here, baby!,' she exclaimed in a confessional after gaining power and the right to put up two houseguests for eviction.

She was congratulated by Nicole Franzel, 28, who was miffed that Kaysar Ridha, 40, exposed her alliance with Cody Calafiore, 29, before he was evicted unanimously by a 10-0 vote.

Tyler Crispen, 25, spoke with Bayleigh and Da'Vonne after realizing that their Slick Six alliance targeted each other during the last Head of Household competition.

Good mood: 'I'm officially here, baby!,' Christmas exclaimed in a confessional after gaining HoH power and the right to put up two houseguests for eviction

'I'm supposed to be in the Slick Six alliance with Cody, Bayleigh, Dani [Donato], Tyler, Enzo [Palumbo]. It's just like we're shooting at each other. It's weird. As far as the Slick Six alliance, after this HoH competition, ain't nobody slick or six not no more,' Da'Vonne said in a confessional.

Da'Vonne then tried to play nice with fellow mother Christmas, but failed to sway her allegiance to her alliances.

Enzo after relinquishing his HoH title to his ally Christmas told her that if he was going to target the 'emotional players' that he would put Da'Vonne on the top of the list along with Nicole and Bayleigh.

Christmas then gathered everyone into the living room as she introduced them to the new Big Brother Basement competition that provided the chance to win three powers.

The contestants completed in total darkness with winners remaining anonymous.

They had to fine power icons and then place them in the correct power podium to win.

David Alexander, 30, won the Disruptor power over the next three weeks that will allow him to save one of the nominees that the HOH nominates and the houseguest chosen is safe for the entire week.

Christmas won The Blocker power that gave her the abiliy to prevent herself or someone else from becoming a replacement eviction nominee during one the next three veto meetings.

Dani also won the Replay power that gives the outgoing HOH, whether it be the power holder or a houseguest of their choice, the ability to play in the next week's HOH competition over the next three weeks.

Disruptor power: David Alexander, 30, won the Disruptor power over the next three weeks that will allow him to save one of the nominees that the HOH nominates and the houseguest chosen is safe for the entire week.

David noted that his secret power could help save either Da'Vonne or Bayleigh after they were nominated for eviction.

'Seeing Da'Vonne and Bayleigh on the block hurts. I do have the Disruptor power, which would allow me to take down Da'Vonne or Bayleigh from the block. It's very tempting to use it. If I wanted to, Christmas' nominations are not set in stone right now,' David said in a confessional.

Big Brother: All-Stars will return Wednesday on CBS.
