The father of a French teenager who vanished at a train station in New Zealand has issued a heartbreaking plea for help on his 19th birthday.

Eloi Jean Rolland moved to Auckland last September to study English before he went missing in Piha - 45 minutes east of the city - on March 7. 

Mr Rolland, who would have celebrated his birthday on Thursday, was last seen on CCTV footage at a train station on his way to the seaside village. 

His father, Thierry Rolland, marked the 19-year-old's birthday by writing a heartbreaking message in first person. 

'My name is Eloi Jean Rolland. Today, Thursday, 19 years old ... but I am a missing person,' the Facebook post read.   

French teenager Eloi Jean Rolland (pictured) went missing in New Zealand in March and his family issued a heartbreaking plea to mark his 19th birthday on Thursday 

He was last seen boarding a train from Britomart Station in Auckland's CBD at 6.30am and exiting the train at Fruitvale Station at New Lynn on March 7

Police believe Mr Rolland (pictured) may have walked around 10km to Piha Road, where his phone pinged, at 9.18am. His family believe he had travelled to collect the famous sand 

'I was last seen on March 7, 2019 on the road to Piha and since that day I haven't given any news to my friends or family.

'My parents are looking for me, their heart is with me and hope to find me safe and sound.

'I am appealing for witnesses, if since my disappearance I have been seen, or spoken to by anyone, please inform my family or the NZ police,' the post read.   

Mr Rolland's family have said he most likely went to the seaside village to collect the area's famed black sand to take home.

The French teen was staying with a host family an hour away in Birkenhead, but failed to return home.  

At 6.30am on the day Mr Rolland went missing, he was captured on CCTV footage boarding a train from Britomart Station in Auckland's CBD.

Nearly an hour late he got off the train at Fruitvale Station at New Lynn.   

Mr Rolland's (pictured) family wrote a heartbreaking Facebook post from the perspective of their son. They called for any information in regards to his whereabouts 

Police believe he may have then walked around 10km to Piha Road, where his phone pinged, at 9.18am.

Mr Rolland hasn't been spotted since and his phone stopped transmitting shortly after.  

The physical search for Mr Rolland was called off in May after more than 1600 hours of searching over two months. 

A NZ Police spokesperson said there had been no further updates to the situation over the last few months.   

Mr Rolland has been described as 170 centimetres tall with a thin build. He was last seen wearing a blue and white jacket with jeans and sneakers. 

A dedicated facebook page has been set up by Mr Rolland's family to which regularly posts photos and updates to remind people of Mr Rolland's disappearance.
