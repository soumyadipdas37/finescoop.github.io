Mischa Barton made many 'It Girl' lists in the 2000s following her breakout role as Marissa Cooper on the hit teen drama television series The O.C.

But on Thursday the actress played the role of doting doggie mama when she stepped out for a walk with one of her pet pooches near her home in Los Angeles. 

The Hills: New Beginnings star, 34, walked casually down the suburban sidewalk with her four-legged family member by her side, and a times let let the dog of its leash for some extra freedom.

Barton stepped out on another warm and sunny day in a white button-down shirt that was tucked into a long black skirt that came down to about mid-calf.

She also donned a pair of stylish black slips and carried a cream-colored purse over  her right shoulder.

On this day, she pulled her long blonde tresses back into a ponytail with a part in the middle.

Being an animal lover, Barton has been open about how her dogs, and the responsibilities that come with them, have helped keep her grounded over the years, especially during the height of her career.   

The London, England native has even found a beneficial silver lining to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic when it comes to staying grounded.

"It's given me a lot of privacy and calm, a lot of time to concentrate on myself and stay at home and be with family and friends,' she confessed to Entertainment Tonight in August about her time in quarantine.

'Sometimes I'm so busy running around and working that I don't get to do that, so it's been nice to see the planet take a little bit of a reset and... see people care more about each other.'

Most recently, Barton has been romantically linked to actor Gian Marco Flamini. The pair were seen walking arm-in-arm and sharing kisses during a stroll in LA's Echo Park last week.

She had been dating Australian model James Abercrombie on and off over the last few years.   

In August, Barton opened up about why she thinks a reboot of The O.C. could work, despite her character being killed off at the end of season three.  

"I think there are ways it could happen for sure. I mean in this industry there's a way to do everything. If you really wanna get The O.C. back, of course we could, of course there's a way," the actress told ET of the drama that also starred Ben McKenzie, Rachel Bilson and Adam Brody.

'Characters can slightly change or diverge or come back as a cousin. Like, who cares?'
