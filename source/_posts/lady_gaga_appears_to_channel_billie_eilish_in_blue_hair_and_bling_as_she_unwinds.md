Lady Gaga recently gave one hell of a performance, while racking up several awards at MTV's Video Music Awards.

But the 11-time Grammy winner appears to be enjoying some downtime, as she gets back to quarantine.

She channeled her inner Billie Eilish as she posted a blue-haired selfie Sunday to Instagram, while lounging around on a sofa and cuddling up to a shoulder (likely belonging to boyfriend Michael Polansky).

Style sisters: The 34-year-old paired her recently-dyed hair with some layers of bling and a black band t-shirt, which has become somewhat of a signature look for Eilish, 18 (pictured in November, 2018)

The 34-year-old paired her recently-dyed hair with some layers of bling and a black band t-shirt, which has become somewhat of a signature look for Eilish, 18.

She's admitted to being a fan of the Bad Guy artist, revealing back in May that she's even offered her guidance.

Gaga told Apple Music: 'Billie swept a whole bunch of awards so I said, ‘Let’s send some flowers’. I wrote her a note. For me, it’s healing because it hurt me that I didn’t get that. I’m going to be that for someone else

She continued: 'I’ve had a harder time with ­older women in terms of having a female ­mentor. Other than Celine Dion and Carole King, it’s proven ­difficult to have someone who would show me the way.

Winner winner: She took home five awards, including Artist of the Year and the inaugural Tricon Award, a new award that recognizes triple threats

A piece for Gretchen Wieners: Gaga said during her acceptance speech: 'I want to share this award with everybody at home tonight, everybody at home who is their own form of a Tricon. I want you to know that you can do this too'

'So I really hope that young female artists – or young artists of any gender identity or sexual identity – will know that I am rooting for them.'

The Chromatica artist has done well without a mentor, recently performing with Ariana Grande from her sixth studio album at last weekend's VMAs. 

She took home five awards, including Artist of the Year and the inaugural Tricon Award, a new award that recognizes triple threats.

Gaga said during her acceptance speech: 'I want to share this award with everybody at home tonight, everybody at home who is their own form of a Tricon. I want you to know that you can do this too.   

'Just because we're separated right now and culture may feel less alive in some ways, I know a renaissance is coming, and the wrath of pop culture will inspire you, and the rage of art will empower you as it responds to hardship with its generosity and love.'
