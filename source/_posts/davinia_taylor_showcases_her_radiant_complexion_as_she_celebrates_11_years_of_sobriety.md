She went teetotal in 2009 following a battle with alcoholism and depression. 

And now, Davinia Taylor is celebrating 11 years of sobriety in style as she relaxes on a post-lockdown beach getaway.

Davinia revealed that one of her friends reminded her that she had been sober for 11 years as she reflected on her journey to optimal health and well-being. 

She said: 'OMG. How weird - I totally forgot and my mate just congratulated me on 11 years of sobriety today !!!! 

'That’s the magic of it all ... I used to count minutes until wine o’clock now it’s decades of without !!!! 

She said: ''OMG. How weird - I totally forgot and my mate just congratulated me on 11 years of sobriety today !!!!... I used to count minutes until wine o’clock now it’s decades of without'

'I can only do this by knowing my triggers like processed foods and lack of exercise etc. 

'I’m going to join for an in-depth chat on our journeys to sobriety this week so I’ll let you know when that interview is ready to listen to!!!'

She previously compared her battle with alcohol to 'being taken over by a parasite,' as she struggled to manage her depression before being formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

Transformation:  The star revealed she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and decided to ditch drinking alcohol, eating processed foods and yo-yo dieting for a healthier lifestyle 

She told Hello! magazine: 'I was in complete denial. I thought if everyone just left me alone and I could have a drink, I would be fine.

'There wasn't an 'Aha' moment. It was much tougher than that. The first 10-months were harder than the past 10 years. Every single cell in my body was telling me to take a drink.

'It was like being taken over by a parasite and the only thing you can do about it was to go cold turkey.'

Before and after: The blonde beauty showed a dramatic before and after transformation pic to followers on her Instagram account as she celebrated her improved health and well-being

The blonde beauty said she is now committed to a daily diet of organic food and gym sessions and attributes her toned physique to 'biohacking'.

She said: 'It means using your personal biology to hack into your best self so you can optimise how you sleep, how you think and how you perform physically and mentally.

'It has been a brilliant journey for me in understanding my past, how I became alcoholic and how I can avoid getting back into that cycle.'

When asked about her previous battle with alcoholism, she said: 'I was in complete denial. I thought if everyone just left me alone and I could have a drink, I would be fine'
