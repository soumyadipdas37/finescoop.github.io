Her glowing complexion made her one of Britain's top fashion models.

And Lisa Snowdon restored her radiant skin on Wednesday as she underwent facial acupuncture and revealed she was 'back on track' following the treatment.

The TV star, 48, had her eyes closed as she lay with tiny needles in her face as well as an oxygen tube up her nose as part of the procedure at Harvey Nichols in London.

Lisa appeared in a state of tranquility and went with just a touch of mascara on her lashes for the cosmetic treatment by Sarah Bradden. 

Posting to Instagram on Saturday, Lisa penned: 'And just like that balance has been restored.

'I know it looks like some sort of crazy torture, like a cross between hell raiser and a pin cushion but i can assure you it’s not ( and I hate needles too! )

Health: Lisa has spoken about the benefits of acupuncture before claiming the procedure was ‘most relaxing’ and helped balance her hormones

'I needed this time to be in the healing hands and energy of my incredible friend Sarah Bradden.' 

She continued: 'All my mates who’ve since embarked on this facial Accupunture journey, reflexology & reiki healing treatment with Sarah, know it’s the bomb!!

'I was so out of whack, the change of season, the autumn equinox had me feeling rather out of sorts, very anxious and definitely not myself - back on track and in the best spirits!'

'BTW I had this treatment on Wednesday, and yes I did pay! OH! And the tube up my nose, it’s oxygen.' 

Lisa has spoken about the benefits of acupuncture before claiming the procedure was ‘most relaxing’ and helped balance her hormones.  

Acupuncture, a Chinese remedy dating back more than 2,000 years, is used to treat everything from backache to migraines and fertility problems. Some acupuncture – though not cosmetic – is even funded by the NHS.

Cosmetic acupuncture claims to work by targeting pressure points with the needles to release energy and endorphins.

This is said to improve blood flow, stimulate cell regrowth and encourage the production of collagen – the protein that helps keep the skin youthful and elastic.

It comes after Lisa hit out at 'savage' fashion designers who once humiliated her into stripping in a toilet then telling her she was too fat for the catwalk.   

The model recalled being left 'embarrassed' when she turned up for an extravagant fashion show in Milan, Italy, but couldn't squeeze into any of the flimsy clothes at age 19.

Admitting she used to be 'tiny', industry moguls cancelled her bookings after she refused to cower to their demands to lose weight. 

Speaking on Vicky Pattinson's The Secret To podcast, the radio presenter said: 'I'd gone to Milan and they told me I was too fat basically, and when I look back, I was like a little stick right.

'I was tiny, the only thing that were big on me were my boobs. I wasn't that curvaceous, I'm more curvaceous now, back then I just had a pair of boobs. I wasn't that super curvy or voluptuous.'
