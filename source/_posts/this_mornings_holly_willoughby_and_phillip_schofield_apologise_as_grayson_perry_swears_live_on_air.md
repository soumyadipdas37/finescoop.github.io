This Morning's Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield were forced to apologise during Wednesday's show as guest Grayson Perry swore live on air. 

Broadcaster and artist Grayson, 60, appeared on the ITV show to discuss his new TV series, Grayson Perry's Big American Road Trip, and also spoke about his experiences of therapy.

But the star left viewers and the hosts stunned as he accidentally turned the air blue as he let slip a swear word.

Speaking via video link from North London, Grayson happily plugged his new TV project, which sees him travel across the US and explores the divide across the country.

He also opened up about his time in therapy and suggested that people need to be more sympathetic to others as several of us carry 'baggage'.

He explained: 'It helps me understand my own lens... we all carry a lot of baggage and we've got to have a lot of sympathy to that baggage... I think therapy is the most... 'no bullsh**' place I've ever been.'

Whoops! The broadcaster and artist, 60, left viewers and the hosts stunned as he accidentally turned the air blue as he let slip a swear word

Holly and Phil looked visibly shocked, before they quickly said sorry to viewers for Grayson's blunder.

Diverting attention from the blunder, the duo hastily wrapped up the chat as they thanked Grayson for appearing. 

Taking to Twitter, viewers were quick to react to Grayson's mistake.
