Australians can send free ice cream to family or friends living in Melbourne after the city plunged into lockdown following its second wave of COVID-19.

Customers from anywhere outside Victoria can surprise their mate with a free dessert, valued up to $20, from a local Melbourne business.

The Uber Eats #LockdownLove offer will run every day from 8pm on Monday, August 31 until Friday, September 4.

Orders are capped at 1,000 per day, so you'll have to be quick. 

Australians can send free ice cream to family or friends living in Melbourne after the city plunged into lockdown following its second wave of COVID-19 

1. Enter your Melbourne-based loved one's address as the delivery location in the Uber Eats app. When you search the app will show restaurants near them, instead of you.

2. Search for local dessert options available from independent restaurants like Pidapipo, Lukumades or Sprinkles Ice Creamery - and many more!

3. On the checkout screen, enter the promo code mondaylove (tuesdaylove, and so on). The first 1000 eligible dessert orders each day made after 8 pm will be able to send their Melbourne mate free dessert (up to $20, including delivery fee).

4. Press 'Order Now', then click the 'Share this delivery' option at the top of the Uber Eats app.

5. Send the tracker link to your friend. When your friend opens the shared link in a browser window, it'll show where in the delivery process that surprise treat is in real-time.

To send a free dessert, Australians will need to enter a Melbourne address of where their loved ones live in the app to see the restaurants near them. 

Order ice cream, churros, doughnuts or any other sweet treat, enter the promo code, press 'order now', then 'share my delivery'. Customers can send the tracking link to their nominated friend so they can track the delivery in real time. 

The initiative comes after the food delivery company found 'evening dessert orders' had skyrocketed by 22 per cent in Melbourne since the city was plunged into lockdown amid its second wave of coronavirus. 

In Australia, the furthest delivery has been sent from someone from Karratha in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, about 3,346km away from Melbourne.

The most generous local gifter is from Sydney, who has sent 15 deliveries to surprise their Melbourne loved ones. 

Up to 17 deliveries sent to Melbourne in the past month have come from generous senders from San Francisco, while more than 270 orders have been sent to Melbourne from New Zealand.

The furthest order from overseas has come from a customer in St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, about 18,214km from Melbourne.
