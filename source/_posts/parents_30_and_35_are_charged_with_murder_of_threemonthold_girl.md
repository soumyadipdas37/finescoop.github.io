The parents of a three-month-old baby girl have been charged with her murder.

Detectives investigating the death of Eleanor Easey, who suffered injuries at home and later died just before Christmas last year, now believe her mother and father were responsible for the tragedy.

The baby was rushed to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital from the family’s home in Morton on the Hill, eight miles north of the city and later transferred to Addenbrooks hospital in Cambridge but was pronounced dead two days later.

A post mortem examination revealed that she died from a severe head injury. It also showed that she was malnourished and had numerous historic fractures sparking a major police investigation.

Christopher Easey, 30, and Carly Easey, 35, the parents of the three-month-old Eleanor Easey, have today been charged with her murder. 

The couple, of Old Roman Bank, Terrington St Clements, Norfolk, appeared before Norwich Magistrates Court via virtual link today where they were remanded in custody, before being due to appear at Norwich Crown Court tomorrow.
