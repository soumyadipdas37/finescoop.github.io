Kerry Katona has revealed that she's in no rush to have children with her new fiancé Ryan Mahoney, after she 'nearly died' giving birth to her youngest child.

The former Atomic Kitten star, who will celebrate her 40th birthday on Sunday, is already mother to Molly, 19; Lilly-Sue, 17; Heidi, 13; Maxwell, 12, and Dylan-Jorge, six, from previous relationships.

And in an interview with new! magazine, the TV personality admitted that they're 'just not there yet' on the topic of having children – but if the couple do decide to have children, she'd be more amenable to surrogacy.

She said: 'I think it'd be really selfish when I have five amazing, to get pregnant again knowing how I almost died in labour last time. Why put myself through that when I could go through surrogacy? So watch this space.'

But that wasn't the only revelation the couple made during their interview, as they also hinted that could well tie the knot during a quickie Las Vegas wedding.

Showing his apparent aversion to lavish nuptials, Ryan, 31, said: 'To me, weddings have always been overrated. I've never been a fan of the big, white wedding.

'I always knew if I was going to do it, I'd want to hop on a plane and do it in Vegas in a chilled-out way.' 

Kerry Katona was seen to break down in tears as her boyfriend Ryan Mahoney popped the question during their Spanish holiday last week.

The former Atomic Kitten star was ringing in her 40th birthday when the hunky personal trainer, 31, dropped down on one knee in front of her delighted children during their idyllic summer break at the Silverfield Villa in Granada.

Sporting an elegant red dress, the blonde beauty could not contain her delight as she was presented with the eye-popping diamond.

Kerry could not contain her delight as she stood before her husband-to-be, who was clearly delighted with the turn of events.

The couple then sipped champagne and posed in front of letters spelling out their names and congratulations cards.

Ryan proposed on Wednesday, during the family holiday in Granada - before which he made the sweet gesture first asked her kids for their mum's hand in marriage.

For Kerry. this will be her fourth marriage. She was previously married to Brian McFadden, 40, Mark Croft, 49, and late ex-husband George Kay.

Earlier in the week, OK! Online revealed the exciting news for the couple.

Yes! Ryan proposed to Kerry last week as they holidayed in Spain ahead of her 40th birthday

A source told the publication: 'Ryan is really close to all of Kerry's kids so he made sure he involved them before asking for Kerry's hand in marriage. He got Kerry a massive two carat diamond ring and showed it to the girls first and they all loved it.'

Since then, Kerry took to Instagram to confirm the news as she shared sweet snaps with her family with the caption: 'Well what a bloody amazing 40th I’ve had.... honestly couldn’t of spent it any better with the people I love the most'.

Alongside a diamond ring Emoji, she then bashfully rounded out the post by writing: 'and with a massive twist too..... here we go again!'

Kerry shares children Molly, 18, and Lilly-Sue, 17, with Westlife star ex-husband Brian. The singer also has Heidi, 13, and Maxwell, 12, with ex-husband Mark and Dylan-Jorge, six, with late ex-husband George.

Quickie: The couple also hinted that could well tie the knot during a quickie Las Vegas wedding

While Kerry Katona has much to celebrate with the joyous news that she's taking another trip down the aisle, her road to romantic bliss has been quite the rocky one. The Warrington native has already made three trips down the aisle, with each marriage coming to a tumultuous end. And with a handful of relationships in between, it's fair to say that the star now deserves her shot at happily ever after. Below is a list of the star's marriages and relationships. 

 

BRIAN McFADDEN (1999-2004)



It was a match made in pop heaven when Kerry and BrianMcFadden met while their respective bands, Atomic Kitten and Westlife, toured together in 1999. Such a whirlwind was their romance that Brian proposed within three months of the pair getting together and they welcomed their daughter Molly in 2001. A lavish celebrity wedding followed in 2002, and a year later, they welcomed their second daughter, Lily-Sue.  But, alas, it wasn't meant to be, as in 2004 the couple announced their separation amid allegations Brian had cheated on Kerry with a lapdancer. Heartbroken Kerry was granted a quickie divorce.

 

DAN CORSI (2004)



Kerry very briefly got back together with her ex, Dan Corsi, who she first dated in 1998. During their time together, they visited Kerry's native Warrington and were also seen partying up a storm at London hotspot-of-the-moment Pangaea. Dan boasted about bedding the star, saying: 'Spending the night with Kerry was all I hoped it would be. I thought she'd find it hard to be with someone else after being with Brian for five years, but it felt natural.' However, friends reportedly feared that Dan was just cashing in on Kerry's fame, amid reports he still lived with his ex, while simultaneously texting another former flame.  It took just six weeks of rekindled romance before Kerry, feeling that it was too soon after the breakdown of her marriage to embark on another relationship, reportedly dumped Dan over the phone. Surprisingly, her ex-husband Brian publicly shared his opinions on Dan, telling The Mirror at the time: 'I've known him for a while and I know he's not the one for her. I don't want her to get hurt. Despite everything that's gone on, I just want her to be happy.'

 

DAVE CUNNINGHAM (2005)



In huge contrast to her glitzy showbiz marriage, Kerry embarked on a romance with her former childhood sweetheart, Dave Cunningham, with the couple announcing their engagement in 2005. However, it wasn't long before their relationship hit the rocks, with the pair getting into a furious row while holidaying in Spain, amid rumours Dave had been seeing his ex-girlfriend behind her back. A source told People at the time: 'Kerry is devastated. After everything she has gone through this year she truly believed Dave could be her saviour. Then the shocking revelations about his ex emerged.'

 

MARK CROFT (2005-2010)



Six weeks after her split, Kerry was swept off her feet by taxi driver Mark Croft. He proposed in 2006 after just six weeks of dating, and they tied the knot on Valentine's Day 2007. Their marriage produced two children: daughter Heidi and son Maxwell. However, the union came about during a tumultuous time in Kerry's life, as she watched her fortune (which once peaked at £6.8million) dwindle to the point that she was declared bankrupt. During her marriage, she also made her infamous appearance on ITV's This Morning, where her slurred speech prompted concern among viewers. She ultimately admitted to a cocaine addiction, as she confessed: 'I hated my life. I'd lie in bed for three days in a row doing cocaine with Mark. We did coke in our en suite and had a lock on the door. The kids knew if the bathroom door was locked they mustn't come in.' After having even considered suicide during their marriage, the couple split in 2010. Mark would later admit that he 'bled Kerry dry' during their ill-fated relationship.

 

GEORGE KAY (2012-2017)



It appeared that a change of fortune was on the cards for Kerry 2012, when she met George Kay, who at the time was working as her driver. Sparks flew between the pair, prompting former rugby player George to pop the question at the top of Blackpool Tower in April 2013. exactly one year later, more joy was brought into their home when Kerry gave birth to their daughter Dylan-Jorge. A trip down the aisle followed in September 2014, and it seemed that Kerry had finally found the elusive One. But trouble entered their relationship just two months after the wedding, when George was hospitalised after showing 'signs of a stroke', leaving Kerry struggling to cope. Her struggles in dealing with George's behaviour led to the couple splitting, though they would eventually get back together and renew their wedding vows. However, things would eventually come to a complete end in 2017, amid accusations of domestic violence on George's part. But the heartbreak didn't end there, as in July 2019, George unexpectedly passed away aged 39.

 

JAMES ENGLISH  (2017)



It took just weeks for the star to embark on a new relationship following her spit from George. Showing she was a woman of the times, Kerry went Instagram official with her handsome new boyfriend James English in 2017. And while the numerous posts of herself spending time with the Scottish comedian were shared on social media, the pair soon quietly went their separate ways within just two months. In fact, their split was so quiet that it wasn't noticed until the star spoke about being a singleton once again.
