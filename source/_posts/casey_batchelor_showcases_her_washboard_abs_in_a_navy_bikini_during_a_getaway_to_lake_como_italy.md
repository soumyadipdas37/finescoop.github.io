She has lost two stone following the birth of her second daughter, Sadie, nine months ago. 

And Casey Batchelor showcased her sensational physique in a navy bikini on Wednesday after jetting off to Lake Como in Italy for a sun-drenched break. 

The reality star, 35, recently embarked on a 90-day fitness plan and displayed the fruits of her labour in a candid image posted to social media.

Casey wore her brunette hair in a natural wavy style, and let her natural beauty shine through for the make-up free snap. 

The mother-of-two is passionate about health and fitness, and she ditched alcohol in 2017 to complete a three-week course and become a yoga instructor. 

 The Celebrity Big Brother star was recently inspired to up her fitness game with a 90-day fitness plan, and she unveiled her impressive weight loss in jaw-dropping before-and-after photos.

She posted a snap of the impressive transformation alongside the caption: 'A little bit proud of myself guys! 

'Not bad for reaching this goal after being stretched twice, having two babies in two years. 

'Here's my 90 Day Challenge results and I've managed to lose 2 stone in 3 months. Last time it was 4 stone in 6 months so am thrilled to be losing at the same rate as last time, even though I've had cheat meals and even a whole week off!

'Am moving on to Bikini Blitz next so will let you know how I get on.' 

The reality star announced the happy news that she had given birth to her second child, daughter Sadie, with fiancé Dane Goodson on January 26.

She originally announced she was pregnant with her second child in July, 14 months after welcoming first daughter Florence into the world.

The yoga instructor said although she and salesman fiancé Dane wanted to expand their family, they weren't prepared for how quickly it would happen.
