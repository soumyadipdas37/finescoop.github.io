Bayern Munich discussed the possibility of bringing Mario Gotze back to the club after being released by Borussia Dortmund, but decided against a move it has been revealed.

Gotze is a free agent after announcing his decision to leave Signal Iduna Park at the end of last season, but has not yet found a new club.

And according to Bild, that could have been the Bundesliga champions, who are looking to add depth to their squad with the pending transfer of Thiago Alcantara to Liverpool.

Bayern Munich had considered bringing Mario Gotze back to the club as a free agent 

However, despite holding talks within the club, chiefs decided against any move - with the player unaware of those developments.

Despite no offer from Bayern forthcoming, Gotze insists that he does not have to make the move away from the Bundesliga.  

'The Bundesliga also belongs to Europe and I never said that I had to leave the Bundesliga,' he told Bild. 

'There are several ambitious clubs in Germany.'

Gotze originally left Borussia Dortmund in 2013 to join rivals Bayern and stayed for three years

However, there is one desire that could shape the World Cup winner's next move, with the 28-year-old desperate to lift the Champions League. 

'I have ambitious goals and I really want to win the Champions League,'  he added.

'That drives me every day, in every way. I don't want to end my career without having won this title once.'
