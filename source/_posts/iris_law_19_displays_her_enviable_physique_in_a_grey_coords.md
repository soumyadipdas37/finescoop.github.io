She is the daughter of Sadie Frost and Jude Law.

And Iris Law proved that she was a star in her own right as she flaunted her model credentials at the Bulgari Spring Summer 2021 event in Milan, Italy. 

The 19-year-old displayed her enviable physique in a cutout grey co-od ensemble as she stepped out with her model beau Jyrrel Roberts, 21, on Friday.

Iris looked effortlessly chic in the tight-fitting outfit which comprised of high-waisted trousers and a plunging square-neck top. 

She scraped her brunette locks into a neat topknot and added a flick of black eyeliner while adding height to her look with a glimpse of a bright yellow heel. 

The star finished her look with a silver clutch bag and floral detailed necklace to draw attention to her décolletage.

Iris finished her swimwear look, which also included tie-waist bottoms, with a pair of stylish orange hued sunglasses. 

The model left her brunette locks loose into a relaxed tousled hairdo and added a slick of sun-kissed make-up.

Iris knew how to work her best angles as she seductively posed on a rock at the beach during her getaway. She captioned the snap: 'Xoxoxoxoxxoxo gossip girl.'

Keeping it real, she also posted a fun snap of herself getting her temperature tested while wearing a mask amid the Covid-19 crisis.    

Last year, Iris discussed growing up with famous parents and how she is managing with her newly found fame in an interview with ES Magazine.

She said her parents, who divorced following six years of marriage in 2003, had given her normality in her childhood despite their A-list status.

She said: 'My dad was really young. He'd had all his kids [with Frost] by 30. Mum, too. She also had a baby face.   

'I can never tell [her age] in pictures, I'll say, "What, you had three kids by that age?" She looks 17.'

Recalling her own memories of that time eating snacks on Primose Hill, she said: 'My parents weren't rock 'n' roll when I was growing up, they were just my parents. 

'Everyone's parents were rock 'n' roll when they were young. That's not a crazy thing.'
