Giancarlo Granda, 29, claims Jerry Falwell Jr. showed up to campus smelling of alcohol 

Jerry Falwell Jr's showed up to Liberty University campus smelling of alcohol and once accidentally sent a nude photo of his wife to numerous people, including his own son, it has been claimed. 

The disgraced former head of the Christian college resigned last month after his wife's affair with Giancarlo Granda, 29, emerged. 

Granda says he had a six-year affair with Becki that began when they met in Miami in 2012, when he was just 20 and was working as a pool boy. He claims that Jerry knew about it and watched them had sex the first time then continued to give his blessing to the affair for years afterwards. 

Their seemingly friendly relationship fell apart when he tried to be bought out of the Miami gay-friendly hostel that the Falwells bought and put him in charge of. 

Then, Granda threatened to 'go kamikaze' and share details publicly. 

To get ahead of him, Jerry released a statement claiming Granda had had an affair with his wife but that it was brief and he had nothing to do with it. 

Afterwards, he stepped down from Liberty - the ultra-religious university that his father, Jerry 'Big Jerry' Falwell Sr., founded. 

Now, Liberty has launched an investigation into Falwell's conduct at the helm of the school.

According to The Wall Street Journal, administrators say Falwell showed up to campus drunk. 

He also accidentally once sent a racy photograph of his wife to administrators at a football game, and to his son, they claimed. He denied the claims in the Journal.  

In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Granda said that the couple had been harassing him ever since he spoke out.

'[They] have been relentlessly harassing me and people close to me,' he complained. 

He said he'd been afraid 'for years' to speak out because of how the couple may respond. 

Liberty tells all of its students that sex should only be between a man and his wife, and that sobriety should be practiced. 

Falwell Jr's behavior during his tenure at the school is now under a microscope and Granda claims it does not fall inline with the university's teachings. 

'Their lavish lifestyle consisted of heavy drinking and going to nightclubs, which is strictly prohibited by the honor code that they expect everyone else to follow,' he said. 

'Everyone at Liberty University treated the Falwells like a royal family. 

'Faculty, the Board, legal team and friends within the trusted 'inner circle' all looked the other way out of fear,' he said. 

The Falwell family has denied any and all wrongdoing. 

They say Granda has been trying to extort them for years and that he is fabricating most of his claims.
