She's known for her standout fashion prowess, but Princess Charlene of Monaco treated fans to one of her most eye-catching looks yet when wearing a Joker-inspired face mask.

The mother-of-two, 42, donned the attention-stealing garment as she joined her husband Prince Albert, 62, at the 107th Tour de France in Nice over the weekend.

And as well as the statement choice of face covering, which featured the quote ‘Why so serious’, made famous by Heath Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight, the royal also debuted a new mini fringe hairstyle. 

It's thought the royal may have chosen her vibrant mask as a nod to her 5-year-old twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella's love of superhero movies.

The two siblings celebrated their fourth birthday with a superhero-themed party inside the Prince's Palace of Monaco’s private quarters. 

The mask also boasted the Batman villain’s red smirk, although it appeared Princess Charlene sported the garment upside down, perhaps unknowingly.

Her protective gear complemented her chic ensemble, which included a bright yellow leather, a white T-shirt, matching trousers and stylish back heels.

Slovak professional cyclist Peter Sagan picked the same mask earlier this year and shared the look on Twitter.

Also on Saturday, Princess Charlene and her husband were reunited with MMA fighter Conor McGregor to cheer on competitors at the Tour de France, weeks after they were snapped relaxing together in Monte Carlo.  

McGregor, 32, and his girlfriend Dee Devlin, 32, were joined by Princess Charlene and Prince Albert in a box to observe the cycling race as competitors set off from Nice, in the South of France. 

The couples were all smiles as they watched the riders pass by as part of the 21 day race and the group were spotted cheering on the cyclists.

It's not the first time the MMA fighter has been seen socialising with the royals and last month he took part in a water bike race where he faced off against Princess Charlene in the waters off Monte Carlo. 

It appears the royal connection may go back several years, with McGregor first meeting Princess Charlene of Monaco's brother, Gareth Wittstock, in May 2016. 

In early March, Prince Albert became the first head of state to test positive for COVID-19. He told PEOPLE at the time that he experienced mild flu-like symptoms. 

'I've a slight fever, not really that bad. A little bit of a cough. I'd a runny nose the first few days, that was the first sign. I've felt a little stuffed up but that's it,' he said. After he spent several weeks self-isolating in the palace, the royal returned to his family.
