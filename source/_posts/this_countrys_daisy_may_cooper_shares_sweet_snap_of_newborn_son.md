The Cincester-born star rose to prominence when she created the comedy series This Country alongside her brother Charlie.

The show follows the daily exploits of best friends Kerry and Kurtan in rural England. 

Daisy married Will Weston last September in an intimate ceremony in The Cotswolds, with the star revealing her nuptials when she paid tribute to her co-star and childhood friend Michael Sleggs.  

Staycation: Last month her husband Will shared a snap of a heavily-pregnant Daisy against a stunning sunset from their staycation at Cotswold Farm Park.

Michael died in July 2019 of heart failure at the age of just 33, and had played Michael 'Slugs' Slugette on This Country.

Daisy penned at the time: 'It's me wedding tomorrow and this one was going to be one of my bridesmaids in a white suit.

'I miss you so much and I will miss you so b****y much tomorrow. Thank the lord for slugs x.'
