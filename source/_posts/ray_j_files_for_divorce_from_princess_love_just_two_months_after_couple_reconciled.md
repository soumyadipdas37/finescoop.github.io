He has appointed celebrity lawyer Laura Wasser for proceedings.

Princess had sought full legal and physical custody of their two kids along with child support.

A representative for the couple said at the time, 'It's a very difficult time for both Princess and Ray J and we are asking that we just let them have their privacy as they work through and deal with this very trying situation.' 

During her second pregnancy Princess and the rapper had an explosive fight with conflicting accounts of what happened in Las Vegas, at the end of November.

She accused him of abandoning her and Melody in Las Vegas after an argument, while he insisted he had stayed in town.

They appeared to make up after the disastrous trip, however, Ray J had been self-isolating away from his wife and children amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

In a May interview with Page Six he claimed Princess insisted he could only see their little ones after quarantining completely alone at a hotel near her house.

The hitmaker alleged she would monitor his Instagram and demand he restart his week of isolation, if he failed to properly socially distance himself from others.

'I’m lonely right now. I don’t want to quarantine by myself. I keep telling Princess, but she says: "If I see one person over there with you, you got to start over," he told the outlet. 

Ray J said: 'So I really have to lock myself in, because I really miss my kids.'

He shared: 'She said I got to put in seven days alone, and I'm good with the seven, but she really want me to do 14, so it's hard to look at the 13 days left.' 

Princess and Ray J married in 2016 at The Cathedral Of St. Vibiana, a Catholic church in Los Angeles.
