She's spent the summer jetting off to sun-drenched beaches in Spain and St Tropez.

And Francesca Allen turned heads once again as she headed to Amazonico restaurant in London's Mayfair on Thursday for a night out with her Love Island co-stars.

The reality star, 24, accentuated her hourglass curves in a figure-hugging khaki-coloured shirt dress with button-down detail.

Francesca matched her classy look with gold strappy heels and a small powder blue handbag.  

The TV personality wore her wavy brunette tresses loose, while emphasising her natural beauty with bronze make-up.  

Also in attendance for the late summer dinner were Francesca's fellow 2019 Love Island stars Molly-Mae Hague and her beau Tommy Fury, both 21, as well as Maura Higgins, 29. 

The former co-stars shared Instagram snaps of what they ate during their lavish dinner date, including spring rolls, sushi, and succulent steak cuts.

Francesca also shared pictures of the fabulously ornate bathroom, which was decorated with patterned tiles and gilt. 

The Love Island beauty has recently returned from an enviable European break to St Tropez and Spain. 

She had been making the most of the eased lockdown restrictions during her recent breaks as she partied alongside pals and relaxed on the beaches. 

Francesca was spotted cosying up to a new man during a boozy night out in London last month.

She looked to be on cloud nine as she got up close and personal with Edward Crossan, vice chairman of London-based waste management company Powerday.

The TV personality, who is family friends with Edward, put on a very affectionate display with the hunk who was previously been linked to TOWIE's Amber Turner. 

In May last year, Edward was seen enjoying a jaunt on a yacht in Ibiza with TOWIE star Amber, 27, who is in a long-term relationship with Dan Edgar, 30. 

Old friends: Also in attendance for the dinner were Francesca's 2019 Love Island co-stars Molly-Mae Hague and her beau Tommy Fury, both 21
