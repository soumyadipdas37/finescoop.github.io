She rose to fame when she became a late arrival on the sixth series of Love Island earlier this year.

And Molly Smith sent temperatures soaring as she shared a series of sizzling bikini snaps on Instagram on Monday.

The reality star, 26, showcased her gym-honed physique as she posed in a white and black printed set.

Molly, who is dating fellow Love Islander Callum Jones, displayed her sun-kissed hue in the photos as she fixed the camera with a sultry stare. 

The beauty let her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders while she also wore a white shirt.

Posing against a brick wall, Molly completed her look for the shoot with a pair of white flip flops.  

She recently returned from a romantic trip to Crete in Greece with her beau Callum where she displayed her flawless sun-kissed tan and abs once more.

Molly looked every bit the Greek goddess with her long golden hair swept over her shoulder in soft curls.

Always on trend, the TV star exuded confidence in a leopard print bikini, paired with some lavender tinted sunglasses and simple gold necklaces.

With a white shirt draped over her shoulders as a cover up, the influencer had been keeping fans engaged with a series of snaps from their romantic getaway.

Molly and Callum, 24, have been an item ever since they met on the winter series of Love Island.

However the iconic summer show was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic and will not return again until next summer when it is hoped COVID-19 restrictions will have eased.

To recover from the drought of a Love Island-less summer, ITV2 have been airing the Australian version of the hit series, and the USA rendition hit the small screen on September 7.
