An Australian mum has shared the ultimate summer DIY project using a pair of macrame rope seats and an old swing set.

The lady, who lives in New South Wales, shared a photo on Facebook of her children's outdoor swing set complete with two adult-sized seats and cushions as well as fairy lights wrapped around the framework.

The result looked like a boho backyard retreat, perfect for lazy afternoon swinging and relaxing chats underneath the setting sun.

'I'm not sure if this has been posted before but it's just an idea for old swing set frames and hanging boho chairs,' she captioned the photo.

It quickly garnered attention online with hundreds of people saying they would like to try a similar 'hack' on the swing sets 'rotting away' at home.

'Excellent idea. I was going to take my swing set down with a sledgehammer but this is a much better option,' one person said.

'Love this so much. I was going to buy another egg chair but not after seeing this,' said another. 

A third added: 'I have this saved on one of my Pinterest boards for my dream backyard. I've been saying that I am going to do it for months so I need to get on that'.

'I actually fit my hammock to rest in between the two swing spots so I can lay in it anywhere around the backyard,' one woman said

Other DIY lovers said they'd tried a similar thing after buying macrame hanging chairs off eBay and were glad they didn't just throw their old swing sets away.

'I actually fit my hammock to rest in between the two swing spots so I can put it anywhere in the backyard,' one woman said.

'I love my swing set now! Who would have thought the adults would be using it all these years later,' said another.

Fairy lights were a common addition for added flair, while others indulged with flowers wrapped around the set itself.
