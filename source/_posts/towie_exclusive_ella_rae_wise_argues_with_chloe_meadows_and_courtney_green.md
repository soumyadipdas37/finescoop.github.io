Ella Rae Wise almost comes to blows with Chloe Meadows and Courtney Green on Sunday's episode of TOWIE.

Tensions simmer as Ella and Clelia Theodorou have an argument with Chloe and Courtney about Chloe Brockett having a fling with Ella's ex Jack McDermott. 

Ella was furious over Chloe Brockett's actions and took her anger out on Chloe Meadows and Courtney, unhappy that they were defending her.

In scenes set to air on the next episode, Courtney and Chloe Meadows were relaxing in a park when they were approached by Ella and Clelia.

Sensing a confrontation was about to happen, Courtney said: 'So what's going on?'

Ella replied: 'I think you know, don't you?'

Courtney came to Chloe Brockett's defense and said: 'I know what you've been saying about stuff with Chloe, and she has admitted it. What I want you to know is that she didn't actually do it out of spite.'

Unimpressed, Ella said: 'To me, you don't do it. I don't condone stuff like that.'

Chloe Meadows then chimed in and said to Ella: 'At the end of the day, you two have not been friends for a long time. She doesn't have any loyalties to you.'

Getting angrier by the minute, Ella shot back: 'I'm not being funny, you can sit there and defend her as much as you want because you are her mates, I get it. But if the shoe was on the other foot, how would you actually feel?'

Before either of the girls had a chance to respond, Clelia jumped in and said: 'I just think it looks so bad guys. She shouldn't have done that.

Chloe Meadows said to Ella: 'At the end of the day, you two have not been friends for a long time. She doesn't have any loyalties to you' 

'Imagine you guys had fallen out and then Courtney goes and does that to you. It's so wrong girls, it is so wrong.'    

Whether or not Ella and Chloe Brockett will manage to patch things up after their fallout remains to be seen. 

The 10th anniversary series was due to start filming in March 2020, but ITV bosses made the tough decision to put the production on pause due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

Fans were left without their Essex fix until the show came back with a vengeance on Sunday night, with former cast member Amy Childs returning.

Ella shot back: 'If the shoe was on the other foot, how would you actually feel?'

There will also be surprise appearances from some of the show's other big stars from the past decade.

Paul Mortimer, Head of Digital Channels and Acquisitions for ITV, added: 'After 10 years, TOWIE is still going strong and remains the number one show on ITVBe.

'We're thrilled to be welcoming back new and old faces for the upcoming mega-series as the show celebrates this special anniversary.'

The Only Way Is Essex airs on Sunday on ITVBe at 9pm.
