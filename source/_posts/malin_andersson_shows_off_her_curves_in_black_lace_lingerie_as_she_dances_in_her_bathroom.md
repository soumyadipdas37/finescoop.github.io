In a recent chat with MailOnline, Malin revealed that she is 'looking for love' and has started 'going on dates again' after her abusive ex-boyfriend Tom was jailed a few weeks ago. 

The 2016 Love Island star described how she would like to start a family and have 'one or two' children adding how she is a 'huge believer in the law of attraction'. 

The mental health campaigner also described how she 'benefitted' from lockdown which gave her the opportunity 'to do a lot more work on herself'.

She said: 'To be fair, do you know what, I am. I have recently started going on dates again which I haven't done for over a year. So I am looking for love - how about that?'

Malin, who also spoke about body positivity at the Lovehoney virtual love camp, added: 'I do want a family - I want a husband.

'I want a good-looking little basketball player. I do like a basketball player and I want my family. I want a few kids maybe one or two I want a little dog.' 

The couple split in 2019 after a violent relationship, and earlier this month, Tom was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar.'
