Serena Williams moved into the third round of the US Open and a step closer to the magic 24.

The 38-year-old American battled past Russian world number 117 Margarita Gasparyan 6-2 6-4 on Arthur Ashe.

Williams requires one more grand slam to equal Margaret Court's singles record, but has been stuck on 23 titles since winning the 2017 Australian Open.

The American legend is chasing down Margaret Court's Grand Slam record of 24

But the field has been decimated by withdrawals coupled with the shock defeat suffered by top seed Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday. 

So Williams has an increasingly clear run to a seventh Flushing Meadows crown.

She will meet fellow American and former champion Sloane Stephens, who beat Olga Govortsova 6-2 6-2, in round three.

'I'm just happy to get through and try to focus on the next round,' said Williams.

'Sloane is such a good player, she plays so smooth. She looks like she is not taking a lot of energy and then suddenly bam! Five winners.' 

Williams will take on Sloane Stephens in the first round and is familiar with her game
