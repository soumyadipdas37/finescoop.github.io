Frank Lampard has revealed that his wife Christine helps him make difficult decisions about Chelsea FC.

The football manager, 42, admitted he often turns to the TV presenter, 41, when faced with tough choices about the Blues.

Speaking on the The High Performance Podcast on Sunday, the former England player - who took the helm at Chelsea last July - said: 'Sometimes, I go, ''Christine, what do you think about this problem? I've got a player here and he didn't turn up for training yesterday.'

'But we still probably need him on the weekend, what do you think?' And she goes, ''Does he have a girlfriend, a wife? Is there a problem? Have you spoken to them? Maybe you should speak to them.'' And I'm like, 'yeah'.

'I'm very fortunate to have someone to bounce things off of at home.'

Opening up further about his relationship with the Irish beauty he added: 'She definitely coaches me and I do throw a lot of things off Christine.

'She's not picking what fullback we're going to play that weekend, but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues, and actually football issues sometimes, I can definitely go home and ask.

 'It's a different view, a different opinion.'

The sports star also said that she helps him keep his head out of the game sometimes, as he's guilty of getting 'bogged down'. 

Family: The couple married in December 2015 at St Paul's church in Knightsbridge, West London, and welcomed their daughter Patricia, two, in 2018 

Frank said: 'Christine has a bit of a joke with me at home when we're watching football constantly all the time. 

'She does reflect on the fact that it's only kicking a ball... She's almost like, you're becoming really, really intense about this, and maybe not seeing a bit of clarity in this instance.'

Christine is a also stepmother to his eldest daughters Luna, 15, and Isla, 13, who he shares with former partner Elen Rivas, 45.

The Premier League season is scheduled to begin on 12 September, with pre-season fixtures for Chelsea expected to be announced in the coming weeks.  

Christine recently admitted she struggled with being apart from her family while isolating with husband Frank and their daughter Patricia.

She said: 'I'm seeing my family for the first time at the moment. That's been the hardest thing for me...

'When I finally got to see my family, it was emotional, which I'm sure everyone across the country has been finding.

'We have been in touch constantly throughout, but when you have a little one, you really appreciate the relationship they have with their grandparents and I don't like them not being part of that and missing out on all the tiny things they do day-to-day.' 

Christine added that Patricia has been delighted to have Frank - who gets tested for coronavirus twice a week - home for the majority of the lockdown after football was put on hold during the peak of the pandemic.

She admitted though that her little girl isn't used to having her dad around so much, joking: 'I am 100% her world because I've been with her 24 hours a day.

'Frank actually being at home for a big chunk at the beginning of lockdown was fantastic, as much as it was for the awful reasons we were there. It was just lovely.'
