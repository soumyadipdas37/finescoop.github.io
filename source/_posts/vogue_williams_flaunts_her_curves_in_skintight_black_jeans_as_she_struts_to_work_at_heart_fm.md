She's a doting mother of two after welcoming her baby daughter Gigi Margaux on July 23.

And Vogue Williams looked sensational as she flaunted her postpartum curves in a pair of skin-tight black jeans on Sunday.

The Irish model, 34, exuded confidence as she strutted to Heart Radio in London to present her show.

Vogue cut a stylish figure in her tight bottoms and a chic black jumper which boasted a high neck and cuffed sleeves.

She added some extra height to her frame with a pair of stiletto heeled boots which left a small gap from her jeans to flash her tanned ankles. 

Never one to forget her accessories, Vogue toted a leopard print handbag and donned some black sunglasses to complete her ensemble. 

The mother-of-two wore her blonde locks tied back in a messy bun for the weekend outing and added a slick of pink lipstick to accentuate her pretty features.

It comes after Vogue proudly showcased her figure as she worked out in her west London garden on Thursday afternoon. 

The mother, who gave birth to her daughter Gigi in July, looked sensational in a black sports bra which she teamed with a pair of leggings.

Vogue showcased her fitness prowess as she practiced a series of movements including lunges and squats using a purple resistance band.

The Heart FM presenter wore her blonde locks swept back into a low bun, while going make-up free and covering her face with a pair of round shades. 

The TV star finished her sporty look with a pair of colourful trainers, as she admitted she was struggling with some moves because she hadn't done them for so long.  

Vogue gave birth to Gigi Margaux on July 23. She and husband Spencer, 33, also have their first child, son Theodore, who was born in September 2018.

Spencer confirmed earlier this week that he and Vogue will be having more children in the future, but only if she allows him to hire a live-in nanny.

During the first episode of their eponymous podcast, the former Made In Chelsea star also stressed the 'necessity' of childcare for working parents. 

Responding to fans' queries about growing their family, Vogue confirmed: 'Yes we will be. Not yet though'.

The reality star then added: 'Depending on the nanny's availability and whether or not she can move in permanently. I won't do it otherwise.'

Vogue shared the details of their agreement as she said: 'Spenny did actually say that, that we could have four kids if I swore that we could have a live-in nanny by the time we had four kids. 

'It's different for Irish people I think because we don't do the whole night nanny thing, and all that stuff, you don't hear about that at home, but here, you have maternity nurses, night nannies and stuff like that and we just don't have that.' 

Spencer left his long-term partner in giggles as he joked he'd wear 'condoms every time' if she tries to have a third baby without a live-in nanny, with the blonde sarcastically replying: 'Good luck, I'd be really into that, we can start doing that right now because I'd rather not go on the pill.'
