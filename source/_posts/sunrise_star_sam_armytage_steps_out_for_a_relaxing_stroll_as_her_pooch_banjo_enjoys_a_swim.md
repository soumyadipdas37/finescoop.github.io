She's the glamorous Sunrise star who recently returned to full-time hosting duties.

And on Wednesday, Samantha Armytage enjoyed a relaxing stroll in Sydney's Rushcutters Bay with her dog Banjo.

The blonde beauty, 44, shared videos of herself walking her Labrador through the park and along the marina.

'Lovely day for a walk,' she wrote in the caption of her video.

Sam then followed up with another clip, showing Banjo paddling through the water, before climbing up the stairs and shaking himself dry.

As he shook off the excess water and left Samantha soaked, she added the caption: 'Or a swim,' along with a laughing emoji.

Her walk with Banjo comes after it was revealed that she and David 'Kochie' Koch returned to hosting Sunrise full-time after Nine's rival program Today closed the ratings gap.

'They are back five days a week,' Seven News director Craig McPherson confirmed on Friday.

The hosts had each been enjoying a four-day working week, with Sunrise newsreader Natalie Barr filling in for Samantha on Mondays and for David on Fridays.

Meanwhile, Samantha chose to take a step back from her on-air responsibilities in favour of a four-day working week in June. 

David confirmed his shorter working week back in 2018, explaining 'his work schedule was taking a toll as there were other things he wanted to do'.

Earlier this month, Nine's Today show, fronted by Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon, won on the East Coast in the ratings war.

These figures represent a triumphant leap in the ratings for the Today show, which had previously dragged around 70,000 viewers behind Sunrise back in June.   

Sunrise is still, however, the nation's most-watched breakfast TV program across the five capital cities, with a viewership of 259,000 compared to Today's 229,000.
