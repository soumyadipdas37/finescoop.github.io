She has jetted to Marbella for a girls' holiday after ringing in her 25th birthday.

And Chloe Ferry showed off her incredible two stone weight loss as she slipped into a green geometric print bikini on Wednesday.

The Geordie Shore star was joined by her co-star Bethan Kershaw, 24, who flaunted her cleavage in a pink Dior inspired two-piece as they lounged around the pool.

Chloe paraded her svelte waist and surgically-enhanced assets in the plunging halterneck top, while the tie-side bottoms hugged her peachy derriere. 

The television personality wore her blonde locks back in a low bun and kept her eyes shielded from the sun with oversized shades. 

After arriving at the pool in a pair of sliders, Chloe slipped them off to take residence on one of the sun loungers.

She also wore black sunglasses and kept her hair off her face by tying it into a high bun.

Chloe said the trolls have got 'inside my head' after being inundated with cruel taunts calling her 'fat and ugly every day'.

The reality star's girly getaway comes after she ignored speculation she had faked a trip to Ibiza and had instead secretly joined her ex boyfriend Sam Gowland, 25, in Dubai.

It had recently been reported that the star had back together with her co-star ex - despite being in the throes of filming Celebs Go Dating. 

A source told The Sun the former-couple were said to be 'reconnecting'; but fans also connected the dots.

An insider said: 'Chloe's taking it really slowly and she's keen to keep it quiet as her friends will all be furious after all the drama. It's a chance for them to reconnect.'

MailOnline contacted Chloe and Sam's representatives for comment at the time.  

The present season of Celebs Go Dating signed Chloe up amid what appeared to be the complete end to her and Sam's romance.

The couple - who have been on/off for years and had a turbulent relationship since first getting together in 2017 - were believed to split for good in February.

This is thought to be what prompted her to sign up for the virtual version of the celebrity dating show.
