Victoria has recorded zero deaths from the coronavirus for the first time in two months as Premier Daniel Andrews is heavily criticised for a $290million plan to revive Melbourne's crippled hospitality sector. 

The state's health department has also reported a fall in the 14-day rolling average and the number of mystery infections. 

Mr Andrews will provide further information on Victoria's new figures later on Tuesday.
