The posts come after Victoria's husband David, who is reportedly being lined up for a stint on Celebrity Bake Off, is said to have been experimenting with recipes during the COVID-19 lockdown.

According to reports, Victoria 'couldn't get enough' of David's homemade pizza after using various different toppings.

Although it has been claimed that the fashion designer who is known for her love of steamed fish and vegetables, is 'back to clean eating' now autumn is approaching. 

A source told The Sun: 'Victoria hasn't touched a carb since 2001. But at the start of lockdown, David started experimenting with recipes — making the dough from scratch and trying various toppings.'

Added the source: 'Victoria eventually relented and had a small slice.    

'Things progressed and, basically, she couldn't get enough of David's delicious golden dough balls.' 

MailOnline has contacted the Beckham's representative for comment.  

David has been perfecting his recipes on their lavish Cotswold estate where he has been spent the COVID-10 lockdown with his wife and three children, Romeo, 18, Cruz, 15, and daughter Harper, nine.
