Drew Barrymore has been working very hard on her two children, her acting career, a makeup empire and now a daytime talk show.

So it's no wonder the Charlie's Angels actress feels that she simply does not have time for any men in her life.

The 45-year-old star told Jane Fonda on Wednesday during the Drew Barrymore Show that she has pretty much sworn off the opposite sex.

No time for romance: Drew Barrymore said on her talk show on Wednesday that she has had no romance in the past five years because she cannot open up

Jane, 82, has said recently that she has stopped dating too.

The 9 to 5 star insisted she has 'closed up shop' and is just not interested in romance after marriages to Roger Vadim, Tom Hayden and Ted Turner.

But when Drew said she is not up for romance, Jane shot back: 'You're too young to swear off anything, you have to say open to anything, I am too old so it's very easy to swear off men.'

'Your argument was so good you were talking about your life... is so full,' noted the Wedding Singer star.

Jane won't date either: But when Drew said she is not up for romance, Jane shot back: 'You're too young to swear off anything, you have to say open to anything, I am too old so it's very easy to swear off men'

Jane said: 'Who has time?' 

Drew added, 'Yes this is what I am getting at.'

Fonda said Drew could squeeze a little affair in: 'I am all for it!' 

Drew said: 'I'm not closed for business. But I have been exactly in that mentality for the past five years, thinking I just don't have the bandwidth, I don't know if I'm willing to open [up,] I just can't fit it in.' 

Her last love: The star and Will Kopelman attend the Los Angeles premiere of Blended in 2014

Close couple: Barrymore and Justin Long Grey Gardens premiere in 2009 in NYC

Another love: The former Playboy cover girl in 2006 with musician Fabrizio Moretti 

One of her husbands: She was wed to comedian Tom Green for one year, from 2001 until 2002

She was most recently wed to Will Kopelman from 2012 until 2016; they have two daughters - Olive, seven, and Frankie, six.

The Guess model was also married to Tom Green (2001–2002),and Jeremy Thomas (1994–1995).

The ET star has also dated Justin Long, Tom Green, Fabrizio Moretti and Luke Wilson.

Drew's next film is The Stand-In with Lena Dunham and Ellie Kemper. 

The day before Reese Witherspoon told Drew she was 'terrified' when she got pregnant at 22.

The Big Little Lie star - who has Ava, 21, and Deacon, 16, with her ex-husband Ryan Phillippe - was just starting out in her acting career when she found out she was expecting her daughter and admits it was a scary time.

She said: 'I got pregnant when I was 22 years old. And I didn't know how to balance work and motherhood. You just do it, you know? I'd made movies but I hadn't, you know, established myself as someone who could demand that it shoot close to my kids' school or, you know, I didn't have any real power, leverage within my industry. I was just like every other mom trying to figure it out - and dad out there, and partner, and grandparent who's raising a child.'

Reese has made a lot of 'sacrifices' for her children, but insists she wouldn't have it any other way because it is 'truly worth it' being a mom.

Speaking on The Drew Barrymore Show, she added: 'You take the food out of your mouth, the clothes off your back, the sleep out of your life. But every bit of it - every bit of that sacrifice is truly worth it because you feel like that's what makes me wake up on a Sunday. It's not movies or my job, it's my kids.'

Meanwhile, Reese previously insisted she doesn't 'stress' about juggling her family and career even though it can be 'unpredictable' at times.

She explained: 'It can get chaotic sometimes, but whether you're working a lot or not, life with children will always be a bit unpredictable.

'All mothers have a lot to deal with, and I've been doing it since I was 22 and Ava was born ... They've seen most of my films, and needs to say my daughter loves 'Legally Blonde!' But when I come home, they see me as a mother. They want me to listen to what they've been doing, help them with their homework. It's only their friends who see me as the big movie star.'

Now they are best friends: Ava and Reese seen this year at home; they are 22 years apart
