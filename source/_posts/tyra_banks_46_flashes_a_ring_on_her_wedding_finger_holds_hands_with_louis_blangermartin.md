Tyra Banks had a sweet ice cream date at Jeni's in Venice Beach, California with her boyfriend Louis Bélanger-Martin on Monday.

The new Dancing With The Stars host, who has been with 45-year-old Louis since August 2018, was holding his hand as she flashed a gold band on her wedding finger.

In August, the former Victoria's Secret model was seen with what appeared an engagement ring on, though she has yet to confirm she is set to wed.

The 46-year-old beauty had on a black halter maxi dress wit an asymmetrical hemline that showed off her arms with a brown-and-white silk print scarf over her head. Her face mask was black.

She also appeared to be without eye makeup and added black sandals that showed off her yellow pedicure.

Her Canadian businessman beau Louis - who founded the companies Groupe W, Inc. and DTI Software, Inc. - was very dressed down in a T-shirt and sweatpants as well as slides.

The model and the University of Quebec graduate also visited Rori's Artisanal Creamery in Brentwood.

In August she seemed to have on a diamond ring in photos obtained by DailyMail.com.

DailMail.com has reached out to Tyra's reps for confirmation of her relationship status.  

The businessman shares a 12-year-old son with his ex-wife Valérie Martin Scraire, while Tyra has a three-year-old son named York with her ex, Norwegian photographer Erik Asla.

Meanwhile, Banks has some very big shoes to fill when she hosts season 29 of Dancing With The Stars after veterans Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews were let go.

The Vogue supermodel will be on her own as she does not have a co-host to bounce jokes off of. And this week the beauty admitted to UsWeekly that she is certainly feeling the 'pressure.' 

Tyra said to Us: 'My goal is for a 12-year-old to be sitting on the couch with their parents and grandparents and everybody can relate personally to what they see on that screen.

'That's a hint. Not giving up the goods. You'll have to tune in!' 

On Tuesday it was also announced that Derek Hough would be filling in for judge Len Goodman who is staying in the UK due to COVID-19.

Derek used to dance on the show then moved on to Jennifer Lopez's World Of Dance.

Derek's sister Julianne Hough also served as a judge on DWTS.
