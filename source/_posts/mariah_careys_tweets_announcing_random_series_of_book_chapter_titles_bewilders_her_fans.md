Mariah Carey on Monday sent a series of tweets revealing the names of chapters in her upcoming book The Meaning of Mariah Carey, leaving some of her followers confounded, and some with witty responses.

Among the tweets the 50-year-old singer sent included 'THANKSGIVING IS CANCELLED,' 'THERE CAN BE MIRACLES,' 'CALAMITY AND DOG HAIR,' 'RESTING IN PIECES,' and 'ONE SUMMER NIGHT, WE RAN AWAY FOR A WHILE…'

Mariah took to Twitter to reassure everyone that Turkey Day was still a go, and that the phrases were titles from her forthcoming book. 

The latest: Mariah Carey, 50, on Monday sent a series of tweets revealing the names of chapters in her upcoming book The Meaning of Mariah Carey, leaving some of her followers confounded, and some with witty responses 

'C’mon, I could never cancel Thanksgiving,' the All I Want for Christmas Is You artist, with a laughing emoji. 'I just wanted to share a few chapter titles from my memoir.'

The forthcoming memoir from the Vision of Love artist, who's mom to nine-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe with ex-husband Nick Cannon, 39, was announced by publisher Andy Cohen Books and Audible earlier this summer.

'Carey's story is an improbable and inspiring journey of survival and resilience as she struggles through complex issues of race, identity, class, childhood, and family trauma during her meteoric rise to music superstardom,' the publisher said in a statement. 

The statement continued: 'By pulling back the curtain on perceptions often told through the filtered lens of media, Carey bravely and beautifully walks through her battles with gender and power dynamics, emotional abuse, public embarrassments, personal failures, and phenomenal victories.

Feedback: A number of Twitter users had clever responses to Mariah's proclamation that Thanksgiving was cancelled 

'In her own words and song lyrics, Carey reveals untold moments and intimate experiences along with anecdotes of sacred moments with iconic figures to craft an honest, unique, and vivid portrait of her extraordinary life.'

Carey said on social media in July that the book would be an 'unfiltered' look at her life.

Coming soon: The book arrives in stores and online later this month

'This book is composed of my memories, my mishaps, my struggles, my survival, and my songs,' she said. 'Writing this memoir was incredibly hard, humbling and healing. 

'My sincere hope is that you are moved to a new understanding, not only about me, but also about the resilience of the human spirit.'

The Meaning of Mariah Carey, which Mariah penned with Michaela Angela Davis, is out on September 29, while she's slated to release a new album called The Rarities October 2.
