The broadcaster, 70, who became a regular host for the programme in 1987 and is the longest serving host in the BBC Radio 4 show's 74 year history, announced her plans to step back from the show in July. 

Dame Jenni opened the programme this morning by saying it was 'very strange' to be hosting her final Woman's Hour, before one of her guests, MP Harriet Harman, praised her 'tremendous legacy.'

Another wrote: 'Feeling emotional listening to Jenni Murray's final day presenting. 

'She's been with me growing as an adult, mother, partner, journalist and career woman.'

Opening her final time in the Woman's Hour chair, Dame Jenni said: 'Good morning and welcome to Women's Hour.

'And yes, it does feel very strange to be saying that for the last time after 33 years!'  







Listeners of the programme said they were left weeping after Jenni's final programme, and flooded Twitter with praise for the long-standing host 

Her final episode celebrated the legacy of the programme and looked back at some of her most memorable interviews. 

The presenter spoke of some of her favourite moments from the programme over the years. 

She added she felt 'much cheered' after receiving the gift of a farewell chocolate cake from celebrity chef Mary Berry, saying: 'It's sitting in front of me, waiting to be shared with the team and we will wait for the end of the programme.' 

Guests, including MP Harriet Harman, praised the programme and Dami Jenni's legacy, with Harriet saying: 'You mentioned at the start of this that we're all the same generation.

Jenni revealed it was 'strange' to be presenting her final programme but said she felt 'much cheered' after fellow broadcaster and celebrity chef Mary Berry baked her a chocolate cake to mark the occasion 

'The thing about our generation is we were the first generation who are not saying "we are going to choose between staying at home and being a housewife and prioritising a career" but we would try and do both.

'That was an incredible social and economic revolution that was invisible to most of the broadcasting world.

'But Woman's Hour, with you right at the heart of it, you made the space for all of these issues to be discussed, day in and day out. We all could hear each other and talk to each other.'

Harriet continued: 'If we hadn't had that space, we wouldn't have been able to find our way forward in the way we have. 

The presenter, who is the longest standing presenter of the programme, was praised by guests for her 'tremendous legacy' 

'You leave a tremendous legacy and I just want to thank you for that.'  

She added: 'I just cannot give you enough respect, so thankyou.' 

Meanwhile novelist and poet Jackie Kay saluted her for 'holding up a mirror to the real world and everything that's been going on in it.' 

She asked Dame Jenni how it felt to be presenting her final show.

Dame Jenni replied: 'I'm sitting on a chair - because I like a solid chair, not a chair that wiggles around - and it's green and it's been here for years.

At the close of the show, Dame Jenni bid farewell to listeners before playing Helen Reddy's I Am Woman, Hear me Roar

'The studio managers have put a blue plaque on it: 'Jenni Murray last sat on this chair on the 1st of October 2020' But it is just very, very strange.'

At the close of the show, Dame Jenni bid farewell to listeners, saying: 'If you do a programme like Woman's Hour, you have to consistently remind yourself that woman are a vast range.
