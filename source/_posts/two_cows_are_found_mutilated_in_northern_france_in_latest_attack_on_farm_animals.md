Two cows have been found mutilated in northern France amid fears that attackers who have been slashing horses across the country are now targeting other animals.

One heifer was found with a cut on the lower part of its neck on a farm in Brittany on Saturday, while another was found with a bone-deep gash on its front leg.

Police are investigating the incident, but say there is no doubt that the animals have been attacked.

Officers are already investigating 150 attacks on animals across France, that has seen them slashed and in some cases killed with body parts removed.

Farmer Eric Poussin said he is astonished that the attackers managed to approach the young cows - aged two-and-a-half - without scaring them off.

Speaking to France Bleu, he said police are doing blood tests to see whether the animals were drugged before being cut. 

Police are thought to be investigating several possible causes of the mutilations, including cult-like rituals, copycat attacks or morbid 'challenges' on social media.

Police arrested their first suspect on Monday after releasing a computer-generated image of a suspected attacker, but he was released today after proving he was not involved. 

Authorities have also warned against vigilante action, with a mother and daughter facing up to five years in prison for harassing suspects with a machete-like knife and a pellet gun.  

Didier Fruchet, owner of a horse club with 80 animals outside Paris, said it was 'stressful to be thinking, what happened tonight? When we arrive in the morning we don't know what we are going to find.' 

Fruchet is taking no chances at his stables in the the Val-d'Oise department, which is also being patrolled by gendarmes as an extra precaution.

He has invested in hunting cameras with night vision that photograph moving targets. 'We do not care how much it costs when it comes to keeping our horses safe,' he said.

Knives have sometimes been used to slash and mutilate the horses, with organs sometimes removed, a horse's face disfigured in one case and a right ear often sliced off like a trophy. 

The Val-d'Oise recorded its first cases on Saturday in which two mares were wounded, one with a cut in the vulva and the other a 12-inch slash on its flank.

Elsewhere, police sought two suspects in the Cote-d'Or region at the weekend after a stable owner reported an intrusion and said one horse had been wounded.

In a sign of how urgent the issue has become, a 40-member team of gendarmes, backed up by police dogs and a helicopter, were sent to the scene but so far have not found the culprits.

Eloise Lang, a rider in Coueron in western France, is still distressed after her horse Ambitieux was attacked.

'I saw that he had a dozen traces of wounds... knife wounds... He had some on his shoulders, flank, chest. He had cuts that were up to a foot long,' she said.

'We hardly sleep anymore, we think about it all the time,' she added.

Reports have come throughout the summer, sometimes on an almost daily basis, of new horse mutilations across France.

'There are about twenty cases of cut ears, but there are also other incidents including genital mutilation and lacerations with sharp objects,' said Colonel Hubert Percie du Sert of France's gendarmerie.

He said there were 'many perpetrators and methods of operation.'

France's national anti-sect agency La Miviludes, which is assisting the investigation, has not found evidence of a satanic rite so far, 'but it is not something we are ruling out', du Sert said. 

The man arrested was being questioned regarding a late August attack in Burgundy, after the head of an animal refuge chased after two men slashing his ponies. 

Stable manager Nicolas Demajean's arm was slashed as he wrangled with one of the attackers and police produced a drawing based on his description. 

Prosecutors said the suspect was known in neighbouring Germany for attacks on animals, and was registered in France for drug-related crimes. 

However, searches of his home did not find conclusive evidence and police eventually accepted that he was innocent.  

'He denied the charges from the start and his alibi could be corroborated,' prosecutor Arnaud Laraize said. 

Laraize said it was not clear if there was any link between the Burgundy incident and the other attacks.

'In this case, we absolutely do not exclude the idea that there is no link with other incidents nationwide,' the prosecutor said.

Separately, Emmanuel Macron's interior minister on Monday announced the start of night patrols by French gendarmes to reassure worried horse owners. 

Gerald Darmanin said police have opened 153 investigations on the horse attacks, with 30 of them involving deaths or 'extremely violent injuries'. 

'No one line is being favored,' Darmanin said of the investigations.

The minister warned horse owners against taking justice into their own hands by trying to take down the attackers.  

'The drama within the drama would be an owner ... wanting to take vengeance, do justice, take out his rifle, fight with someone who goes after his horses,' he said.

In Quimper in the northwestern Brittany region, a mother, 52, and her daughter, 23, face a trial in January for threatening two people with weapons whom they suspected of carrying out horse attacks.

'They admitted they were equipped with a machete-type knife as well as a pellet gun, and to have stopped a vehicle when they had no right to do so,' the deputy prosecutor of Quimper, Emmanuel Phelippeau, told AFP.

They risk up to five years in prison if convicted.

'It is unacceptable that breeders, due to emotion, take the law into their own hands themselves', the prefect of the Finistere region Philippe Mahe, told reporters, insisting that the police mobilisation was 'very strong.'
