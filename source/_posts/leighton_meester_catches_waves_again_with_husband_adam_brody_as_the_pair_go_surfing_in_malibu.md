She was seen just the day prior riding the ocean waves on her own. 

And on Friday, actress Leighton Meester was back to surfing yet again, this time with husband of six years Adam Brody as the pair were seen out on the water in Malibu, California.

The Gossip Girl star, 34, and Ready Or Not actor, 40, both wore dark bucket hats to shield their eyes from the sun as they hanged ten, each showing their aquatic prowess atop their respective surfboards.
