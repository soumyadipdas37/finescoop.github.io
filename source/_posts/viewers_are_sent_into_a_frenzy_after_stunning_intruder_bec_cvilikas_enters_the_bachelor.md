Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor saw the arrival of intruder Bec Cvilikas, generating plenty of drama.

Bachelor Locky Gilbert was thrilled by the addition of the 25-year-old blonde bombshell, while the remaining girls admitted they felt threatened by her presence.

But the show's viewers had a completely different take on the situation, with many complaining it was too late into the series to introduce a new lady.

'There's an intruder arriving? Hasn't this season already lasted 3726128474 weeks?' tweeted one viewer.

Added another: 'If we have an intruder a week this series could go for 72 years and end with a funeral'.

Others claimed the adventure-loving intruder seemed too good to be true, after she seemingly ticked all of Locky's boxes.

'So this intruder sounds like a robot programmed to like sunsets?' tweeted one fan, while another wrote, 'The "intruder" looks like she is in an ad for active wear'.

Meanwhile, some fans correctly predicted that contender Roxi Kenny would have a meltdown after finding out about the addition of Bec.  

'How much will Roxi cry over the intruder?' tweeted one viewer, while another commented, 'The intruder is a stunner. Roxi is going to implode.'

After being introduced to Bec, Locky admitted she was everything he could ever want in a woman.   

'She's stunning! I can't pick my jaw up off the ground,' the 31-year-old boasted.

'Very happy. She's frickin' amazing! She's adventurous, stunning, loves to be outdoors, is happy to live in a tent. I mean... all the boxes are being ticked.'

Feeling jealous: The girls weren't enthused about having an intruder, particularly Roxi, 29, who claimed Bec was just on the show looking for 'fame'

But the girls weren't as enthused, particularly Roxi, 29, who claimed Bec was just on the show looking for 'fame'. 

'I'm, like, full suspect on this chick. I'm just like... you can't come in looking like that at the very end and be like, "I'm here to find love with Locky..."' she vented.  

'Like, do you really have a hard time finding a partner when you look like that? Oh, she's so good-looking. It actually hurts my soul.'
