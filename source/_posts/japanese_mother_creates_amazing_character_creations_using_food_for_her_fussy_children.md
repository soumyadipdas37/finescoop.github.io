A Japanese mother has become an online sensation after using food to create much-loved film characters for her fussy children.

With designs including a Winnie the Pooh made from oranges and a Toy Story's Forky created using rice, it's perhaps of no surprise that Etoni Mama, from Tokyo, has amassed an Instagram following of more than 150,000.

The mother-of-three practises a Japanese art called kyaraben which is a style of elaborately arranged bento (a home-packed meal).  

Made out of kiwi, melons and even eggs, the food entertains Etoni’s three children, aged 12, 10, and 8 - with her middle daughter previously being a picky eater.

Speaking to Metro.co.uk, the mother said: 'I started making the food to catch the interest of my [picky] daughter. The inspiration is to look at the ingredients and think of a character.'

Here, FEMAIL reveals some of the creative parent's most interesting designs...

Speaking to Metro.co.uk earlier this month, the mother said: 'I started making the food to catch the interest of my [picky] daughter.' Pictured, an egg dish made to look like Cogsworth from Beauty and the Beast

She added: 'The inspiration is to look at the ingredients and think of a character.' Pictured, Toy Story's Mr. Potato Head made from a burger-type dish

Toy Story's much-loved Hamm impressively created with only the use of two fried eggs and some pieces of salad

And it's not only famous movie characters that get a seat at the mother's table, with the parent also creating animal-themed meals (above)

Seriously adorable! These orange-based desserts have been made even more fun by the use of smiley faces and little hats 

Scary! This little guy was carved out of watermelon and appeared to be a firm-favourite online with the mother's many fans
