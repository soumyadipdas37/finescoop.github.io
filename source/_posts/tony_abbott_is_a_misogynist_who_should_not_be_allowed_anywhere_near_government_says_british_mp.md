A British Conservative Party MP has slammed Tony Abbott's appointment to the UK's Board of Trade.

Caroline Nokes said the former Australian Prime Minister is a 'misogynist' who is not the sort of man that should be representing the British people.

The Australian government, which currently has an international coronavirus travel ban in place, granted Mr Abbott an exemption to fly to London last week where he is tipped to take up a new role as a trade advisor in the aftermath of Brexit.

He is expected to work alongside Trade Secretary Liz Truss who heads up the British Trade Board.

But Ms Nokes says his appointment is likely to undermine Ms Truss - one of few women to hold a prominent position within Boris Johnson's Government.

'I'm not sure I can come up with words for how awful I think it is… she is president of the board of trade and is being told she is going to jobshare with a bloke from Australia,' she told the BBC.

'He is a misogynist, he has very poor views on LGBTQ rights and I just don't think this is a man who should be anywhere near our board of trade.'

Mr Abbott has often come under fire for his staunchly conservative views, including climate change denial and opposition to same sex marriage.

In 2011, the Australian Liberal Party Stalwart caused outrage when he campaigned in front of offensive signs that described Australia's first female Prime Minister Julia Gillard as a 'witch' and another man's 'b***t'.

The following year Ms Gillard took to parliament in a landmark speech scolding Mr Abbott for his apparent sexism.

'If he [Mr Abbott] wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives, he needs a mirror. That's what he needs,' she told parliament.

But despite his controversial viewpoints, Mr Abbott is vastly experienced when it comes to drawing up international trade deals, signing three free trade agreements with China, Korea and Japan during the two years he was in office. 

Julia Gillard once said the moment Tony Abbott (pictured with microphone) used signs describing her as a 'witch' and a man's 'b***h' back in 2011 for an anti-carbon tax rally should have ended his career

During a discussion at the UK's Policy Exchange think tank, Mr Abbott defended his record and highlighted the importance of an Australian-Britain free trade agreement.

'Inevitably if you have convictions you'll draw criticism… but if you want to get things done, you need people with convictions and if you lack convictions, it's very hard to get things done,' he said.

'I think it's in Britain's interests and it's in Australia's interests that this particular free trade deal be done as quickly as possible.'

But Ms Nokes is not convinced Abbott is the right man for the job.

'We need a free trade deal with Australia and we need it to be quick, but we also need free trade deals with the rest of the world. Is he the sort of man who should be representing us globally? No.'

There has been no official announcement regarding Mr Abbott's new role in the UK.

'I'm not sure I can come up with words for how awful I think it is… she (Ms Truss) is president of the board of trade and is being told she is going to jobshare with a bloke from Australia,' Ms Nokes (pictured) told the BBC
