Earlier this week, it was reported that Julianne Hough and Brooks Laich were 'working on' their marriage, four months after announcing their separation. 

And now it seems the pro-dancer has joined her former pro-hockey player husband in Idaho, where he has been quarantining since the split. 

A source told People on Monday that couple is enjoying time near the spot they wed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho where they wed in 2017.

Laich, 37, went to Idaho after they announced their separation in May, while Hough, 32, stayed in Los Angeles. 

'They decided to separate and to do their own thing,' a source told the outlet.  'Brooks always wanted to stay married and made a lot of changes to make it work.' 

Adding: 'He was getting frustrated. He was hoping that Jules would come around, and she finally has.'

Though, Julianne 'realized that Brooks really, really loves her. He is a great guy and so supportive of her. ... They are having the best trip,' adding that 'the lockdown was a blessing.'

While the couple hasn't personally commented on their reunion, they have not been shy at hinting about it on social media. 

They both shared photos with Hough's Husky Koda, on Instagram, in recent days, seeming to say they are spending time together. 

With the dog resting his chin on the top of her head, Hough captioned the photos 'This sweet boy loves his momma.' 

While Laich has shared multiple photos and videos of the pup sleeping and swimming in water.

A source told People, last week, they are 'definitely working on their marriage again' and that 'a reconciliation is looking more and more likely.'

The first public sign that Hough and Laich's marriage may be in trouble was when they confirmed they were quarantining separately just after the COVID-19 crisis was deemed a pandemic in March. 

Another source revealed to People that they decided to take the next step, and part ways, after realizing they were 'perfectly happy and fine being apart' during the pandemic. 

'We have lovingly and carefully taken the time we have needed to arrive at our decision to separate,' the estranged couple said in a joint statement on May 29.

The Dancing With The Stars alum admitted to being on a heightened journey of self-discovery and personal exploration since about four months after they tied-the-knot in July 2017, in an interview for Women's Health September 2019 issue 

During their time apart, Laich has been described as being open to the possibility of giving the marriage another shot. 

'Julianne likes the idea of freedom but doesn't want to lose such a good, solid guy,' an insider said.

'Everyone who knows him knows how grounded and great he is. Her friends and family don't want her to lose someone like that.'
