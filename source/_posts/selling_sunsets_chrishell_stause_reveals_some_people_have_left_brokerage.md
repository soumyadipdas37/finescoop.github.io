After series three aired it was revealed Jason's twin brother Brett left to set-up a rival brokerage, but Chrishell has hinted more of the cast have since departed. 

Chrishell said: 'I have to say, a lot of us get along so well, it's like a dysfunctional family. There is some splintering happening in the group but that's real life. 

'I'm not going to sugar coat it. We're not all friends, we don't all get along. But we try to.

She said: 'Oh yeah, now I'm dancing - I've got pro dancers teaching me dance moves every day, I definitely don't have anything to complain about. 

'I can't say I'm very good at it but I'm having a lot of fun trying.

 'It was really tough, but that was a while ago and now we're onwards and upwards.' 

Of dancing on the US ballroom show she said: 'I have to say, I was still wracked with nerves even without an audience.

'I'm hoping that's going to subside a little bit... it still felt very nerve-wracking. That being said, I think the audience would make you feel better because they're really cheering for you!'

Discussing losing her parents Chrishell said: 'They would have been my biggest supporters. I feel my mum has given me some signs. 

'She'd have been the first person who would have wanted me to do the show [Dancing with the Stars], which is really what made me want to do it. 

'Life is short, and I want to make the most of it and that's the lesson I'm taking from that. 

'I know she's with me as she's giving me some little signs here and there which I really appreciate and it's really special.' 

Room for improvement: Chrishell did her first dance earlier this week but placed in the bottom three
