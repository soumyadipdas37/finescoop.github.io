Fulham host Aston Villa at Craven Cottage in the first game on Monday evening in the Premier League.  

Scott Parker's side are yet to record their first points of the season, after defeats against Arsenal and Leeds in their opening two matches following their promotion from the Championship. 

Aston Villa, meanwhile, have won their first three games of the new season in all competitions, including a 1-0 victory against Sheffield United at Villa Park in their league opener last week, courtesy of Ezri Konsa's winner.  

Sportsmail will provide live coverage of Fulham vs Aston Villa including score, lineups and build-up.
