Myer has suffered $172.4million losses as the coronavirus pandemic takes its toll on the department store.

Total sales fell by almost 16 per cent in the year to July 25.

'During the pandemic, the primary focus has been on the health and wellbeing of customers, team members, and the broader communities in which Myer operates,' a Myer spokesman said.

'All stores were closed for the majority of April and May, approximately 10,000 team members were stood down.'

Online sales increased by 61 per cent as shoppers ordered more from the store while stuck at home in lockdown.
