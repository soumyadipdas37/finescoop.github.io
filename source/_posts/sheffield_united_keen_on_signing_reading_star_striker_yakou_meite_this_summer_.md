Sheffield United are showing an interest in Reading forward Yakou Meite as Chris Wilder looks to bolster his strikeforce ahead of the new season.

Meite has scored 30 goals for the Royals during the previous two seasons and is attracting interest from a number of clubs across the top flight.

And the Blades are keen on the 24-year-old forward, who started his career at Paris Saint Germain.

The 24-year-old has scored 30 goals for Reading in the last two seasons, including 17 last term

Reading want to keep Meite, but the Championship side could be forced into selling as they look to safeguard their finances following the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on EFL clubs.

Meite was born in France, but has two caps for the Ivory Coast. He made one appearance for the PSG first-team before joining the Royals in 2016. 

After a disappointing first season in Berkshire, he joined Ligue 2 side Sochaux on a season-long loan though only scored five goals in 35 matches in the 2017-18 campaign.

Several Premier League clubs are interested in signing Meite, who started his career at PSG

Upon his return to Reading, the striker netted 12 goals to finish as the Royals' top scorer that season.

And he managed to better that tally last season by finding the net 17 times in all competitions as Reading finished in 14th place in the second tier.
