Paul Pogba has returned to training with Manchester United after recovering from coronavirus.

The 27-year-old midfielder tested positive for covid-19 last month but reported back to United's Carrington training ground ahead of their friendly against Aston Villa on Saturday.

Both Pogba and his wife, Maria Zulay, were positive for the virus but she revealed that the pair are feeling better, as he wrote on Instagram last week: 'Home taking some vitamin D, we are feeling much better now.'

The £89million signing missed out on international duty with France in their Nations League wins over Sweden and Croatia as he continued to recover.

He posted an image to his Instagram as he spent some quality time with his family and young child, where they wore matching clothes in his garden. 

It is unknown whether Pogba will travel to Villa Park with the rest of the squad this weekend for their friendly, but he has returned to the training complex ahead of the new season. 

Pogba is yet to sign a new deal with the Red Devils with his current contract running out next summer, but there is an option for a further year.

It is reported that he is stalling a new contract as he is waiting to return to Juventus, with Andrea Pirlo, who Pogba played alongside in midfield during three of his four years in Turin, now the manager at Juve, according to Italian outlet Tuttosport.  

Juan Mata is another United player whose pre-season has been interrupted, as he is currently finishing a quarantine period since returning from Spain.

The 32-year-old had some tests that came back negative, but he is continuing to self-isolate in his Manchester home and according to the Manchester Evening News, he has not reported to the club's training ground yet.
