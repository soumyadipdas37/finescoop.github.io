Independently rated as the UK's most reliable vacuum brand, Henry Hoover is a trusted buy for many homes and offices.

A faithful cleaning companion, it's a great all-rounder, cleaning carpets, hard-floors, cars, stairs and even hard to reach places.

If you loved the original Henry Hoover but found it a tad bulky, then the Hetty Hoover could be your perfect match. Smaller in size than Henry, it offers the same high efficiency motor that makes cleaning a breeze, but in a more compact model. Even better, the Hetty HET160 Bagged Cylinder Vacuum is now reduced to just £99 on Amazon. 

The highly-rated Hetty HET160 Bagged Cylinder Vacuum is now just £99 on Amazon - that's a saving of £30.99

With over 1,500 reviews on Amazon and a near flawless score of 4.8 out of 5, the Hetty Hoover is a widely popular vacuum cleaner. In fact, Hetty is currently the number one bestseller for 'Cylinder Vacuums' on Amazon. 

She may look small but shoppers report that she packs a punch, offering the same specifications and features of the Henry Hoover, just in a more compact model.

'Great, buy,' wrote one delighted shopper. 'Went for the Hetty as it’s just a bit smaller than the Henry and easier to store in the cupboard, but nothing compromised on the performance at all. If you’re looking for a brilliant vacuum cleaner, look no further.'

Another shopper agreed, comparing the Hetty to the Henry, writing: 'I have a Henry but find it quite heavy for every every day cleaning so decided to get a Hetty which is much lighter but still a very powerful cleaner. 

I love the way the brushes fit onto Hetty and the hose fits on as well so it looks really neat and its easy to store. My Henry is now my upstairs cleaner and Hetty for the rest of the house.'

While small in stature, the bucket-shaped Hetty Hoover is deceptively large. In fact, it boasts a six litre capacity which claims to be up to five times bigger than many bagless vacuums meaning you won't have to empty the bags as much. 

The Hetty Hoover comes with several features that make cleaning easy, including super long-reach, a trouble-free rewind 10m cable, six-litre capacity and on-board tool storage

It's lightweight too, weighing just 7.5 kg compared to the Shark Upright Vacuum Cleaner which weighs 10.1kg. 

Like the Henry Hoover, Hetty makes light work of making floors wondrously clean. The high-performance combi floor tool means that she can easily switch between carpets and hard-floors while the professional toolkit - including a crevice tool, upholstery nozzle and soft dusting brush - means you have a tool for every job.

One shopper raved: 'She's the greatest! It's definitely quieter than my old Dyson, but has so many other advantages too.... The cord is longer AND it winds away easier, it's much easier to manoeuvre. She holds a lot more than the Dyson and She's prettier too. The suction is unbelievable in comparison'

Another agreed, gushing: 'I absolutely love my Hetty!!! You cannot beat this hoover. An absolute must!'
