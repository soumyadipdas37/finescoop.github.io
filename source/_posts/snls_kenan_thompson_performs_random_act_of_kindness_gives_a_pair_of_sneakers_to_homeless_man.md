During these uncertain times, amid COVID-19 and the push for racial equality and social justice, comes a random act of kindness at the hands of Kenan Thompson.

The Saturday Night Live star took a moment out of his afternoon on Monday to give a a pair of sneakers to a homeless man.

Thompson had been out shopping in the Tribeca neighborhood of Downtown Manhattan when he took notice of the young man who regularly walks the streets of New York City without any shoes on.

With a brown bag in his left hand, the comedian was nearly unrecognizable wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap and matching protective mask when he stepped out of a store after making a purchase.

After starting his walk up the street, Thompson spotted the man and noticed he was wearing just one sock, that had many holes, on his right foot.

It was at this point that Thompson seemingly turned, changed direction and headed to his car that was parked nearby. 

The comedian took a quick detour, grabbed the sneakers out of his car and signaled to the homeless man that they were for him

Moments later, the funnyman grabbed a pair of white sneakers out his vehicle and walked back towards the vicinity of the store and put the sneakers on the sidewalk.

He then called out for the man, who was dressed in athletic shorts and a t-shirt, and signaled to him that they were for him.

The man's eyes appeared to light up, and a smile came over his face, when he went over to grab the sneakers.
