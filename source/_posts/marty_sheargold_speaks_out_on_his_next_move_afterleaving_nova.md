Marty Sheargold recently did his last show Nova after revealing he was leaving the radio station in July. 

Now the radio host has addressed chatter about his next move - shutting down talk he could head to Triple M or start a new podcast. 

Speaking to Radio Today, the 49-year-old said: 'I'll be happy to go out for dinner by then, let alone any kind of gainful employment'.

Radio Today reported that the major podcast networks have denied they have any plans with Marty.   

According to The Herald Sun, industry whispers had recently suggested that the radio host could be joining the Hot Breakfast show next year, which is hosted by Eddie McGuire and Luke Darcy. 

The publication reported that the two hosts will have contract talks later this year.

Marty broadcast his final show for Nova on Friday, and has been replaced on the drive show by comedian Joel Creasey, 30. 

He shocked fans in July when he announced he was leaving his Nova national drive show, Kate, Tim and Marty.

During the announcement, he explained to his co-hosts Kate Ritchie and Tim Blackwell that he 'spent the last 'four or five months tossing up' what to do in 2021.

'Kate, Tim and Marty will no longer feature Marty at the end of the day,' he said on-air. 'Thank you to the network for having me, putting up with me.

'Over the last four or five months I've been tossing up what I'd like to do in 2021, and what I've decided to do is leave the show,' he added. 

In an official statement, Marty thanked his co-hosts for their support in his decision.

'I've had a fantastic 10 years with the Nova Network, having worked with buildings full of talented and dynamic people,' he said.

'I'd like to thank Tim and Kate for their support of my decision and wish them continued success with the show.

'Now feels like the right time for me professionally to keep challenging myself and to embrace future opportunities with renewed vigour and enthusiasm.'

While he's yet to reveal his next move, Radio Today understands a podcast and a return to his comedic roots may be on the cards.
