Richard Wilkins turned a car park into a change room while filming for the Today show in Byron Bay on Friday. 

The 66-year-old started off in a long-sleeved, blue shirt and dark jeans, while going without shoes. 

He quickly stripped down to just a pair of black underwear, showing off buff form in the process.

The entertainment reporter was all smiles as he performed his public strip off by his car. 

His boyish good looks evident, and wearing his blonde hair in his trademark coif, Richard look far younger than his 66 years.  

Once he was out of his clothing, Richard popped on a pair of green shorts with a pineapple print.
