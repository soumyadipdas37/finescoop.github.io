Today show hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon have slammed Ellen DeGeneres' apology following allegations that her show harboured a toxic workplace.

On Monday, the US comedienne kicked off the 18th season of her daytime talk show by telling her virtual audience she was 'taking responsibility' of the damning claims while also acknowledging she was not a behind-the-scenes villain that several reports had suggested.

However, Allison lashed out the 62-year-old for the 'weird and uncomfortable' comedic undertones in her five-minute monologue while Ellen super-fan Karl suggested it was time for her to 'go away and re-establish her connection with the people who mattered'.

'She took no ownership!' Today show hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon have slammed Ellen DeGeneres' apology following allegations that her show harboured a toxic workplace.

Over the last few months, Ellen was weighed down by allegations that she treated staffers with little or no respect and that senior producers allowed and encouraged a toxic work environment.

And on Monday, the TV personality addressed those reports on the new season of her talk show, while also squeezing in a few jokes.

Ellen's delivery raised eyebrows with host Allison as she told Nine US correspondent Amelia Adams via a live link: 'You could tell she wasn't comfortable delivering it. She got the tone completely wrong.'

'If that was a male talk show host and he was opening the show host, and he was opening the show to address allegations of sexual harassment and bullying, and he made jokes about it, we wouldn't cop it as an audience.'

'But somehow because it's Ellen and she is a comedian that that is OK.'

'She needs to re-establish her connection': Allison lashed out the 62-year-old for the 'weird and uncomfortable' five-minute monologue while Ellen super-fan Karl suggested it was time for her to 'go away and re-establish her connection with the people who mattered'

'There didn't seem to be any ownership of it. I mean this was her show, she did say everything has her name on it. That's when she made that weird joke about her name on underpants.

'It felt like it [Ellen's apology] was actually going somewhere, but then there was this slapstick moment.'

Making her frustration evident Allison continued: 'Other people have lost their jobs. You can't say this was happening on your show that you've been running for 17 years and for you to be oblivious.'

When asked about his opinion on the matter, Karl was clearly disappointed as he explained: 'Ellen has brought me so much enjoyment over the years.  

Having her say: On Monday, Ellen addressed reports that she treated staffers with little or no respect on the new season of her talk show, while also squeezing in a few jokes

In Ellen's apology, she said: 'I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realize that with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show'

A disappointed Karl explained: 'Ellen has brought me so much enjoyment over the years. Maybe it's about her going away and trying to re-establish that connection with the fans and the people who she really always looked after. They came first'

APRIL: Ellen staffers' complain about how they've been treated during the pandemic in a Variety report which said producers left them 'high and dry'

JULY 16: BuzzFeed article alleging toxic environment including claims that; 

JULY 31: Second BuzzFeed article alleging more misconduct, this time of a sexual nature 

AUGUST: Executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman, and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman are all fired

SEPTEMBER: Former household staff speak out, saying Ellen treated them 'like nothing' and lay traps like matchsticks to make sure they were dusting 'every inch' of her home 

'I love watching her, and I love her delivery, but I think that monologue at the start kind of highlighted that she is not as connected as she once was to the people, like myself, who are such great fans of hers.

'Maybe it's about her going away and trying to re-establish that connection with the fans and the people who she really always looked after. They came first.

'Now not even the fans inside her own production company are being looked after,' she said.

In Ellen's apology, she said: 'I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realize that with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.'

Later, she went on: 'The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad. I get mad. I get anxious. I get frustrated.  

'I get impatient. And I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress.

'And I am especially working on the impatience thing. And it's not going well because it's not happening fast enough I will tell you that.

Among the allegations against DeGeneres ran a workplace which fostered racism, sexual misconduct and bullying. She apologized to staff privately in a conference call.

The show then faced additional accusations about sexual misconduct in a second BuzzFeed News article on July 30, in which dozens of men and women accused Kevin Leman, Ed Glavin and Jonathan Norman of sexual harassment, misconduct or assault.

Leman and Norman denied the claims. They and Glavin were promptly suspended while Warner Bros. launched an investigation.

Oh boy welcome to season 18 of the Ellen DeGeneres show. If you're watching because you love me, thank you, if you're watching because you don't love me, welcome! 

How was everybody's summer? Good? Mine was great. Super terrific. I am so happy to be back in the studio. There are a lot of things I want to talk about. I've been looking forward to addressing it all directly and unfortunately talking directly to people has been illegal for six months so I a virtual audience here instead, here you all are. You look beautiful and I am sure you smell great, that's what I am imagining anyway. 

All right, let's get to it. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show and then there was an investigation. 

I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realize that with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show. 

This is the Ellen DeGeneres show, I am Ellen DeGeneres, my name is there, my name is there, my name is on underwear... we have had a lot of conversations over the last few weeks about our show, our workplace and what we want for the future. 

We have made the necessary changes and today we are starting a new chapter. There were also articles in the press and on social media that said I am not who I appear to be on TV because I became known as the be kind lady and here's how that happened. 

I started saying be kind to one another after a young man named Tyler Clementi took his own life after being bullied for being gay. I thought the world needed more kindness and it was a reminder that we all needed that.

I think we need it more than ever right now. Being known as the be kind lady is a tricky position to be in. Let me give you some advice out there, if anybody is thinking of changing their title or giving yourself a nickname, do not go with the 'be kind lady'. Don't do it. 

The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad. I get mad. I get anxious. I get frustrated. I get impatient. And I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress. And I am especially working on the impatience thing. And it's not going well because it's not happening fast enough I will tell you that. 

Listen, I don't know. I'm a talk show host but maybe some of you know that I was an actress. I've played a straight woman in movies so I'm a pretty good actress but I don't think that I'm that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you. 

This is me and my intention is to always be the best person I can be. If I've ever let someone down, if I've ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that. If that's ever the case I have let myself down and I've hurt myself as well because I always try to grow as a person. I look at everything that comes into my life as an opportunity to learn. I got into this business to make people laugh and feel good. 

That's my favorite thing to do. That and Jenga. I love that game. And now I am a boss of 270 people. 270 people who help make this show what it is. 270 people who I am so grateful for. All I want is for every single one of them to be happy and be proud to work here. 

This has been a horrible summer for people all around the world. People are losing their jobs. People are losing loved ones to a pandemic. People are losing their homes and lives in the raging fires that are going on. There's blatant racial injustice all around us. I watch the news and I feel like, where do we even begin? 

So my hope is that we can still be a place of happiness and joy. I still want to be the one hour a day where people can go to escape and laugh. I want to continue to help the people that we help every day. And I am committed to making this the best season that we have ever had. 

So welcome to season 18 of the Ellen Show. I am so glad that you are here. I want to start the new season by saying hello to my friend Twitch . 

'You are not my DJ any more. You are now my co-executive producer. You are such an important part of the show. Unfortunately I had to take the fake DJ equipment away.'
