When asked whether she planned to start a family, the media personality said she 'felt the time was right' as she was content in her relationship with Danny.

'Yes we planned & fell the first month but everyone is different. I don't know if you ever feel the time is right,' she said.

'I just was very happy in my relationship & knew it was right & I've always wanted to be a mumma. Plus I had lots of practise with my sisters babies, the only difference is I got to give them back.' [sic]
