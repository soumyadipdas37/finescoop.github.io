Golden Globe winner Drew Barrymore celebrated the premiere of her daytime talk show The Drew Barrymore Show by lighting the Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan on Monday evening.

'How excited am I to see the Empire State Building light up in the Drew Barrymore Show signature yellow?' the 45-year-old host asked at the event. 'I'm freaking out!'

Drew called the Big Apple publicity stunt a 'true New York moment' of her life and a 'memory to keep forever.'

Barrymore - turning up her own effervescent charm to the max - even pretended to embrace a statue of the 102-story Art Deco skyscraper inside the lobby.

The former child star's syndicated CBS talk show had secretly been in the works for 13 months.

Drew then took the elevator up 86 flights to the observation deck for a look at the incredible view of the city.

Barrymore looked conservative in a yellow silk blouse tucked into a high-waisted grey midi-skirt and brown suede boots selected by stylist Lee Harris.
