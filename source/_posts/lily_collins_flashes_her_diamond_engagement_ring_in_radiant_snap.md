She's been on cloud nine ever since director Charlie McDowell popped the question during a romantic trip to Arizona last week.

And Lily Collins took to Instagram to flaunt her rose-cut diamond engagement ring in a radiant snap on Tuesday.

The actress, 31, looked typically stunning as she held up her statement piece, which she hailed as her 'favourite new accessory.'

Cutting a chic figure, the Les Misérables star was dressed in a black cold-shoulder top as she posed by a floral print wall.

The thespian held onto her the strands of her lightly-curled tresses to show off her stunning item of jewellery. 

On Lily's striking ring, gemstone experts The Natural Diamond Council told MailOnline: 'Rose cut diamonds look like a flower—in fact, the cut resembles a spiral of petals in a rose bud. This diamond shape comes in two forms: single rose cut and a rose cut with additional layers of diamond facets.

'The rose cut is a fantastic option if you want more for your money: It’s a great alternative to the popular round cut. Even better, they tend to have more spread, which means more of the carat weight faces up, making the diamonds appear larger than a brilliant cut of the same carat weight.

'One of the appeals of rose cut diamonds is that they get very close to your skin. Rose cut diamonds are very sensual and tactile, more intimate.' 

Lily is the latest in a long line of A-List partners for Charlie, who directed The One I Love and The Discovery. 

The LA native has dated several high-profile actresses, including Emilia Clarke, 33, Hilary Duff, 32, and Rooney Mara, 35.

Charlie was in a relationship with Hilary for three months between September and December 2007.

The Bye Bye Benjamin star then had a serious romance with Rooney for over six years from 2010, which came to an end in September 2016. 

Charlie and Game Of Thrones star Emilia confirmed they were dating in October 2018, but the relationship fizzled out and they called it quits in February 2019.

Lily has also had her fair share of headline-grabbing relationships, including a brief romance with her Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile co-star Zac Efron, 32, in 2012.

The brunette had an on/off romance with British actor Jamie Campbell Bower, 31, for five years after meeting on the set of The Mortal Instruments, but the pair called it quits for good in 2018.

Lily and Charlie both have famous parents in common; Lily's dad is British musician Phil Collins, while Charlie is the son of actor Malcolm McDowell and actress Mary Steenburgen. 

Late last year, the pair took their relationship to the next level as they adopted their rescue dog, and have been living together in Los Angeles amid the coronavirus pandemic.
