Her shoot came after Kate and former footballer Rio, 41, reportedly splashed out £40,000 on a pair of highly-trained dogs to protect their home.

The celebrity couple are said to want extra security at their mansion for their growing family.

They reportedly enlisted the help of a special protection dog company, Chaperone K9, to buy the pair of black German shepherds.

'The couple already have a dog - Kate's chihuahua - but Rio will enjoy walking these pair a lot more!

 'They are incredible family dogs and will protect them like nothing else - everyone has one these days and who can blame them after everything that's happened with the other footballers. Rio is taking no chances!'
