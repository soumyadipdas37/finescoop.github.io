Georgia authorities have released body cam footage showing the terrifying moment a fugitive pulled a gun on a sheriff’s deputy and shot him as he was pulled over on a highway before dawn on Monday morning.

In the video, a sheriff’s deputy carrying a flashlight approaches a pickup truck that has a trailer attached to its rear.

When he approaches the driver’s side window, he finds a man wearing glasses and a purple tank top.

The sheriff’s deputy asks the man for ID. Immediately afterward, the man flashes a gun, and the deputy appears to duck. The video ends at this point. 

Authorities in Georgia released bodycam footage from a traffic stop on the southbound Interstate 75 highway before dawn on Monday

When a Whitfield County Sheriff's deputy approached the driver's side window, he asked the driver, who has been identified as Dalton Lee Potter, 29, for his identification

Potter is then seen flashing a gun. The sheriff's deputy is knocked backward and the video footage is cut off

Law enforcement officials in Georgia identified the man in the video as Dalton Lee Potter.

Potter and another man on the run from police are considered 'armed and dangerous' after they allegedly shot and wounded a sheriff's deputy before crashing their stolen trailer and running off into the woods. 

Potter, 29, was wanted in Texas when he was pulled over in a white Chevrolet Tahoe, pulling a stolen utility trailer, in Whitfield County, Georgia, on Monday morning.

Potter opened fire on Deputy Darrell Hackney, who was saved only by his bulletproof vest.

Hackney and another deputy, Adrian Gomez, both returned fire, but Potter escaped, driving south on Interstate 75, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. 

Potter, from Leakey, Texas, then sped off in the stolen trailer, crashing it on I-75 South.

On Monday morning Georgia sheriffs issued an alert for Potter, following the shooting

A second wanted Texas fugitive, Jonathan Hosmer, 47, was later identified by the wreck

A second man, Jonathan Hosmer, 47, also from Leakey, was captured on a home surveillance system in a subdivision near the truck wreck.

Both men are now being sought by police - with Potter being seen taking off into the woods.

Hosmer was wanted in Texas for burglary. 

Potter has been charged with aggravated assault on the deputy; Hosmer has not yet been charged but an arrest warrant has been issued for him.

'Potter is considered armed and dangerous and a 'Blue Alert' has been issued for Potter's capture,' the Georgia Bureau of Investigations said. 

Scott Chitwood, Whitfield County sheriff, said the deputy was treated at a hospital and is now at home. 

'Thank goodness that his vest protected it,' said Chitwood. 

'He was treated and released at the hospital last night. Had a burning sensation, little abrasion, but overall fine, right below the rib cage.'

Local residents are assisting police, WRCBtv reported.

John Locklear, who lives near the crash site, said he told police he had seen him on Monday morning.

'He walked, went down that road, went over the railroad tracks and went that way, I said about five minutes ago,' Locklear said. 

'I looked at him and he turned his head, he didn't want me to look at his face. 

I said, well, there's something weird about that. So I got back here and checked my stuff out to see if anything was missing. 

'But they said he was armed,' Locklear added.

Chitwood said eyewitness reports have helped them narrow their search, which was filmed by Fox5 Atlanta.

'One of the neighbors gave the description, we felt like it was legitimate, we focused on that area. 

'But we've come up with nothing at this point. We did come up with a pack of fresh cigarettes we felt like possibly could be his,' Chitwood added.

It's unclear why Potter came to Georgia.
