Channel 4 have scored a huge ratings hit with their 2020 series of The Great British Bake Off.

It's been revealed that the first episode of the new series, which aired on September 22 had the biggest ratings of any programme - excluding films - to be shown on Channel 4 since 1985. 

According to the broadcaster, consolidated viewing figures for the series 11 debut were 10.8 million. 

They're a hit! The first episode of the 2020 series of The Great British Bake Off had the biggest ratings of any programme to be shown on Channel 4 since 1985

The TV premiere of the film Four Weddings And A Funeral on Channel 4 in 1995 attracted a higher audience of 12.4 million.

The biggest-ever audience in Channel 4's history remains 13.9 million, which was for the mini-series A Woman Of Substance in 1985.

The show was also the biggest overnight launch audience for the series since its move from the BBC, with overnight ratings averaging 6.9 million viewers.

The cooking competition left BBC One in a £75million switchover in 2016.  

Light-hearted relief: Bake Off opened with new host Matt Lucas impersonating a bumbling Boris Johnson who urged viewers to 'Stay Alert, Protect Cake and Save Loaves'

The first episode of the new Bake Off series saw Matt Lucas make his debut on the programme as he replaced previous co-host Sandi Toksvig, joining co-host Noel Fielding and judges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood.

The start of the debut episode for series 11 was delayed by 15 minutes to make room for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's address at 8pm, which three million people tuned in for on Channel 4.  

Bake Off played up to the schedule clash, opening the episode with new presenter Matt impersonating a bumbling Boris who urged viewers to 'Stay Alert, Protect Cake and Save Loaves.'

The series had already seen it's start date pushed back by a month from its usual late August slot after filming was delayed by lockdown.

The production worked to ensure COVID-19 restrictions would not impact the close-knit nature of the show. 

All 12 bakers, presenters Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding, judges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood along with the entire crew lived together in an isolation bubble for six weeks in order to film.

The production took over luxury hotel Down Hall in Hertfordshire with all cast and crew living together on site for the duration of the shoot, undergoing regular COVID-19 testing and living away from their families.

This allowed the bakers and the judges and presenters to forgo social distancing in the famous tent. 

The opening episode provided plenty of drama when it eventually got underway, with the stand-out moment coming during the Technical Challenge.

Great British Bake Off continues on Channel 4 on Tuesday nights at 8pm.
