She's said that she's excited for viewers to see the real her and not the 'husband killer' she was made out to be on the hit Netflix documentary Tiger King.

And Carole Baskin looked ready for action on Thursday, as she was seen heading into rehearsals for the first time at the Dancing With The Stars studio in Los Angeles, California.

The sighting comes after it was confirmed that the Big Cat Rescue owner, 59, would be participating in season 29 the hit dance competition series on ABC.

 Carole, who became one of the favorite stars of the Tiger King doc when it premiered on Netflix at the start of quarantine, did not disappoint with her outfit on Thursday, which was feline inspired from head to toe.

The exotic cat advocate wore a large white and floral shirt that incorporated a snow leopard pattern.

She paired that with leggings featuring a classic large yellow leopard print.

The cat is in the details: The tiger queen even sported a knapsack displaying the likeness of a leopard, and her hair accessory was in a cheetah print as well

Even her loafers were cat-branded, with the face of what looked to be a domestic tabby cat.

In keeping with California law regarding face coverings during the ongoing pandemic, Baskin wore one of her very own masks, in black with a cat mouth and whiskers.

Her famous catchphrase 'Hey all you cool cats and kittens' was branded across the front.

While Carole was seen walking into the studio with security, those present report that Brandon Armstrong was seen entering before her – which could mean he'll be her partner for the season.

Her long blond braid hung down on her shoulder, but one element in Baskin's trademark wardrobe was visibly absent – the flower crown she usually wears on her head.

During a recent appearance on Good Morning America ahead of shooting DWTS, Carole said: 'Tiger King really glamorized animal abusers and villainized me for trying to stop animal abuse, and so I felt really betrayed by that. 

'But what amazed me was how many people believed that false portrayal of me without doing anything to find out who I really am. It's been a nightmare since Tiger King aired.'

The 'false portrayal' to which Baskin refers is the insinuation, in the documentary, that she was responsible for the mysterious disappearance of her second husband Don Lewis in 1997.

And while it's possible that Lewis may have simply absconded to Costa Rica, never to be heard from again, the Tiger King filmmakers nevertheless gave considerable screen time to wild theories and accusations that Carole fed him to her tigers, or hid his body in a septic tank, or both.

But as always, Carole wants to take the focus away from her feud with the Tiger King himself, Joe Exotic, and focus on animal rights and welfare, especially when it comes to big cats.

'The longer my partner and I can stay in the running and in the competition it will keep the cats forefront in the viewer's eye and to me that was where Tiger King missed the ball - it really should have been focused on the animals,' she continued on GMA.

'I am competitive, but I am competitive with myself. I want to do the very best that I can possibly do.'

Carole will be joined on the new season of Dancing with the Stars by rapper Nelly, Backstreet Boys star AJ McLean, former Desperate Housewives actor Jesse Metcalfe, Disney Channel star Skai Jackson, and Return To Paradise actress Anne Heche.

The new season premieres on ABC on Monday, September 14th.
