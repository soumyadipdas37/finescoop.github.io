Lauren Goodger has criticised UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson after he encouraged all workers who can work from home to do so from Wednesday in an effort to limit the spread of coronavirus.

The former TOWIE star, 34, who was forced to cancel her huge birthday bash earlier this month, took to social media on Tuesday as she claimed she had lost out on a 'whole year of work' due to the Covid restrictions in place.

'I don't need to party, I need to work', the beautician declared in reference to all pubs, bars and restaurants in England being subjected to a 10pm curfew from Thursday.

The media personality owns her own beauty company called Laurens Aesthetic's and has been keeping busy by brushing up on her skills at Manchester's Cosmetic Couture Clinic in recent weeks. 

On the new changes, the reality star wrote on her Stories: 'Borris you can lock me down indoors all you want from 10pm no problem I don't care about the nighttime.. 

'But do not stop me from working in the day as I've lost this whole year of work! I can't do tv shows as planned cancelled because of Covid...  

'so I'm back on my grind and nearly ready @lg_aestheticslondon @cosmeticcouture_! Work mode & need the paper I don't need to party I need to work.' (sic)

Determined: The UK Prime Minister also revealed all pubs, bars and restaurants in England are being subjected to a 10pm curfew from Thursday in a bid to limit the spread of the virus

All pubs, bars and restaurants in England will be subject to a 10pm curfew from Thursday, while premises must kick out all of their customers by the cut off point.

As well as the 10pm cut-off and work from home initiative, the hospitality sector will also be restricted to table service only as the Government outlawed drinkers making a trip to the bar. 

Fines for flouting the Rule of Six and not wearing a mask are increasing to £200 for first offences, and the police will now have the option of asking the military for support with soldiers potentially being drafted in to fulfil office roles and guard protected sites in order to allow officers more time to crackdown on rule-breakers.

The number of people allowed to attend weddings in England is being slashed to 15 from Monday but the number of people allowed to attend a funeral will stay at 30.

Lauren has been focused on rebuilding her career and recently vowed to take a month off drinking following her boozy outing with a mystery man at Cirque le Soir in Soho in August. 

This isn't the first time she claimed she's giving up alcohol as she toyed with the idea in March after feeling 'anxious', with the hangover bringing back memories of her nightmare Boxing Day hospitalisation caused by antidepressant withdrawal.

The brunette claimed the unfortunate after-effects of her night out were not unlike the symptoms that led to her needing medical attention in December.

Just weeks earlier, Lauren broke down in tears as she detailed her first therapy session in a candid Instagram video.

Reflecting on her past, the Bethnal Green native became emotional as she detailed her anxiety battle. 

Insisting she wants to be 'the best version' of herself, she said she'll share her experience with at-home counselling with her fans every week in a bid for them to discover 'the real Lauren'.
