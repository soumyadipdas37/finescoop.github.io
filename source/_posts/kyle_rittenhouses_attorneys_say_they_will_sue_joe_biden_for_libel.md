Attorneys for Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse have announced they plan to sue Joe Biden and his campaign for libel after the presidential candidate tweeted a video suggesting the teenager is a white supremacist. 

Lin Wood, who is representing the 17-year-old shooter, on Tuesday said he is taking steps to demand a formal 'public retraction' from the Biden/Harris campaign shortly after the former VP shared the clip.

The 50-second video showed a mashup of scenes from white supremacist rallies and far-right groups across the country as debate moderator Chris Wallace is heard asking Trump if he is willing to condemn the racist organizations.

The Democratic candidate on Tuesday shared a video clip denouncing white supremacists that including a photo of Rittenhouse wielding a gun 

The clip also includes a shot of Rittenhouse holding a rifle during the Kenosha protests, where is accused of fatally shooting two demonstrators.

'There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night,' Biden said.

The tweet received over 273,000 likes and more than 67,000 retweets.   

'[A] formal demand for public retraction is being prepared for Biden/Harris Campaign on behalf of Kyle Rittenhouse. I also hereby demand that [Joe Biden] immediately retract his false accusation that Kyle is a white supremacist & militia member responsible for violence in Kenosha,' Wood tweeted in response. 

'On behalf of Kyle Rittenhouse, I shall sue Joe Biden & Biden/Harris Campaign for libel. 

 'I am partisan in 20/20 supporting [Donald Trump.] I am non-partisan trial lawyer who aggressively pursues truth to achieve justice. Put in your hearing aid, Joe. You will hear footsteps,' he added in a follow-up tweet.

He later announced attorney Todd McCurty would be joining Rittenhouse's legal team in pursuing the libel case. 

'Presidential candidate [Joe Biden] had defamed Kyle Rittenhouse by suggesting on this video that he is a White Supremacist. The#Left just will not stop. I am working on the retraction demand now for Mr. Biden and his campaign,' McCurty tweeted.  

Neither Biden nor Harris responded to the tweet. 

Rittenhouse, who is from Illinois, is currently fighting extradition to the Wisconsin where he is charged with shooting dead two protesters. 

Rittenhouse participated in a hearing last Friday at the Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois via video link from the detention facility where he is being held

He is charged with first-degree intentional homicide in connection to the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, during a night of unrest in Kenosha on August 25. 

He is also charged with wounding a third demonstrator, Gaige Grosskreutz.  

His attorneys have said Rittenhouse acted in self-defense and have portrayed him as a courageous patriot who was exercising his right to bear arms during a night of protests over the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake. 

Rittenhouse, who was arrested in his hometown of Antioch, participated in a virtual hearing last Friday at the Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois from the detention facility where he is being held. 

Lawyer John Pierce told the judge he planned to fight the request by Kenosha prosecutors that Rittenhouse be transferred to Wisconsin to face charges. 

The judge, Paul Novak, gave 14 days for the defense to review papers and file pleadings ahead of an October 9 hearing. 

Pierce asked for a month to prepare arguments challenging extradition that he said involve 'issues of some complexity, frankly that have not arisen in the country for some time'.
