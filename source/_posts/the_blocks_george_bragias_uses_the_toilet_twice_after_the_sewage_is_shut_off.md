George Bragias just couldn't hold it in during Monday's episode of The Block. 

The 33-year-old electrician created a 'nightmare' for his plumber, when he decided to use the toilet twice after the sewage was cut off.   

His plumber emerged from the house looking slightly traumatised, before going over to talk to foreman Keith Schleiger. 

Oh crap: George Bragias just couldn't hold it in during Monday's episode of The Block. The 33-year-old created a 'nightmare' for his plumber, when he decided to use the toilet twice after the sewage was cut off

'Got a bit of an issue with George in here this morning, mate. Like, we were doing the plumbing and stuff, and we've cut all the sewer, but George has gone and... he's used the toilet,' he told him.

'What?' responded a shocked Keith.

The plumber explained that it was 'going to be a bit smelly', after George stopped by to use the toilet.

'Got a bit of an issue with George in here this morning, mate. Like, we were doing the plumbing and stuff, and we've cut all the sewer, but George has gone and... he's used the toilet,' the plumber told a disbelieving Keith Schleiger (left)

'So he's had a dump?' asked Keith, with the plumber clarifying, 'Two. Two this morning, yes.'

Added Keith: 'And that is sitting in the pipes right now... I've got a weak stomach, mate. Are you serious?' 

Keith then decided to go and have a word with a seemingly clueless George about the situation he'd created.

'And that is sitting in the pipes right now... I've got a weak stomach, mate. Are you serious?' added Keith

Flushed: Keith then decided to go and have a word with a seemingly clueless George about the situation he'd created

'Hey, Georgie! Have you been to the toilet this morning?' an incredulous Keith asked him. 

Smirking, George simply nodded his head as Keith asked him how many times he'd been, prompting him to hold up two fingers. 

'I just said, "I'm so sorry!" I didn't even think, man,' George admitted, as he tried not to laugh.

As Keith struggled to contain his disgust, George burst out laughing, before putting the blame back on the plumber.

'He should've told me, don't use it. He should've sent me an email last night. How am I supposed to know?' he added.

Added Keith: 'When you've gotta go, you've gotta go.' 

'He should've told me, don't use it. He should've sent me an email last night. How am I supposed to know?' George said of the plumber
