James Haskell has revealed he and his wife Chloe Madeley will try for a baby 'once they have a settled income stream'.

In a new interview, the former rugby union player, 35, said the couple, who will celebrate their second wedding anniversary in December, discussed the topic of children for the first time during the coronavirus lockdown.

The I'm A Celebrity star admitted that while the personal trainer, 33, was 'previously undecided' on the prospect of starting a family, she has now changed her tune and shows the TV star 'a lot of baby pictures' in her spare time.

James said: 'In lockdown she started talking about wanting a baby for the first time. Chloe was previously undecided but I am being shown a lot of baby pictures.'

'We were talking about trying for a baby at the end of this year or the beginning of next, but I want to make sure we have a house that we’re settled in first and make sure we have a settled income stream.'

The sportsman also shed light on their relationship, confessing that they considered couples therapy in the past and have their 'ups and downs'.

DJ James, who lives in Northamptonshire with Chloe, added to The Sun: 'Therapy really helped me when I quit rugby, and I would encourage anyone to do it. We do argue and we both have very staunch, often differing opinions. But we’ve never split up.'

Elsewhere in the discussion, the media personality joked that his long-term partner claimed he's 'slept with 1,000 women', but he knew she was 'The One' when she 'harangued' hospital stuff to stay by his side as he recovered from surgery. 

Earlier this month, Chloe admitted it 'hurt' when she was accused of nepotism because she is the daughter of TV legends Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan.

The fitness enthusiast told how people thought she got advancements in her career due to her family connections, which she feels she did.

Speaking to Radio Times, she said: 'I was accused of nepotism because I was Richard and Judy’s daughter. It was true, therefore it hurt. Now I’ve built up my own thing, I feel a lot stronger.'

The blonde got her start in TV as a roaming reporter on shows that her parents presented and later appeared as a contestant on Dancing on Ice in 2011.

She later became a contestant on The Jump and has also regularly appeared on the small screen for her work in the fitness industry. 

Chloe and James have created a new podcast called Couples Quarantine focusing on the challenges faced by couples who are now living and working at home.
