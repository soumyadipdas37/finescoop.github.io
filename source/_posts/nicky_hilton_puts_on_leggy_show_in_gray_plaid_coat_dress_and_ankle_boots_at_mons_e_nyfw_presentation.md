New York Fashion Week began on Sunday.

But with COVID-19 pandemic restrictions still in place, most fashion houses on choosing to present their collections digitally or remotely and without using models or runway shows.

On Monday, socialite and hotel heiress Nicky Hilton put in an appearance to support NY fashion label Monse at an outdoor presentation of its Resort 2021 collection.

Hilton, 36, a fixture on the Big Apple's social scene, put on a leggy show for her appearance.

She opted for a gray plaid coat dress with matching wraparound scarf.

And the wife of banker James Rothschild went bare-legged in a pair of very high-heel black lace-up ankle boots.

Her blonde hair was styled with a slightly off-center parting and she sported designer sunglasses and safety pin earrings.

Against the backdrop of the coronavirus, New York Fashion Week has been shortened from six days to five.

Most brands are hosting their presentations on their own platforms, on the CFDA's Runway360 hub or on NYFW.com, which is run by IMG.

The handful of in-person events that are being held will follow safety measures recommended by the CDC andf will enforce social distancing, according to fashionista.com.
