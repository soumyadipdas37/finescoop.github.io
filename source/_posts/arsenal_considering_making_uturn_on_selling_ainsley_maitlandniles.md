Arsenal are ready to reconsider their plans to sell Ainsley Maitland-Niles after the youngster’s emergence as a key player for the club.

The versatile midfielder was the star of the show against Liverpool on Saturday as the Gunners clinched the Community Shield. But the academy graduate’s future has been uncertain this summer amid interest from Wolves, Newcastle and Brighton.

Mikel Arteta wants Maitland-Niles, 23, to stay but it remains to be seen if that is enough to ensure he remains at the Emirates Stadium.

Arsenal are now ready to reconsider their plans to sell Ainsley Maitland-Niles 

Maitland-Niles, who earned his first England call-up on Saturday, has three years left on his current deal but is not one of the club’s biggest earners. His growing impact on Arteta’s plans could persuade the Gunners to explore the possibility of fresh terms.

Arteta has shown massive faith in Maitland-Niles, starting him in high-profile matches including the FA Cup semi-final and final at the end of last season, while fans are desperate for him to stay given he has emerged through the club’s youth ranks.

However, Arsenal are keen to balance the books this summer — highlighted by their decision to make 55 redundancies earlier this month.
