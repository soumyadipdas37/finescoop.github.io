Everton expect to confirm the signing of James Rodriguez from Real Madrid on a three-year contract over the next 24 hours.

Details were being finalised on Tuesday evening ahead of the 29-year-old’s arrival. 

The Colombian will be joined by midfielder Allan from Napoli, who is joining for around £21million.   

Everton expect to confirm the signing of James Rodriguez from Real Madrid 

Rodriguez, who joined Real Madrid in 2014 from Monaco, has struggled to convince at the Bernabeu, having been sent out on loan for two seasons to Bayern Munich in 2017. 

Despite being handed chances to impress by Zinedine Zidane, it is now clear his future remains away from the LaLiga champions, and Goodison Park could prove his next destination. 

It follows the news earlier this week that the Toffees had been handed the chance to sign the 29-year-old, who has just one year left on his current deal at the Bernabeu. 

According to Marca, Carlo Ancelotti has played a key role in convincing the Colombian

Rodriguez has played under current Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti at both Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, with a strong working relationship previously appearing to hold a great deal of weight for the Colombian.  

Talks are ongoing with Watford over Abdoulaye Doucoure. 

Everton are set to complete a deal for Allan, says Napoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis
