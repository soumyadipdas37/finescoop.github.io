She's known for turning heads in typically daring ensembles, whether she's at a high-profile event or enjoying a low-key stroll.

But Lauren Goodger put on an uncharacteristically casual display as she headed to beauty training centre Cosmetic Couture Clinic in Manchester on Wednesday.

The former TOWIE star, 33, opted for comfort in a waterproof jacket, a sleek blouse and wide-leg trousers.

Maintaining her dressed down appearance, the beautician teamed her outfit with black trainers.

The influencer injected a hint of glamour into her look by carrying her essentials in a Prada cross-body bag and accessorised with circular-framed shades.

With her tresses worn in a straight fashion, Lauren complemented her beauty with dewy make-up and faint pink lipstick.

The reality star seemingly wanted to brush up on her beauty skills after opening her salon called Lauren's Way back in 2012.

Earlier this month, Lauren revealed in New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame. 

She explained: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.

'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me. 

'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".' 

The TV star claimed her mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father, who started his 'own life', from the age of four.

Lauren recently broke down in tears as she detailed her first therapy session in a candid Instagram video.

Reflecting on her past, the Bethnal Green native became emotional as she detailed her anxiety battle. 

Declaring she wants to be 'the best version' of herself, she insisted she'll share her experience with at-home counselling with her fans every week in a bid for them to discover 'the real Lauren'.
