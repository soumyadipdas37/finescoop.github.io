She rarely puts a foot wrong when it comes to style. 

And Francesca Allen looked effortlessly cool in a fitted stone suit with a simple white camisole for a dinner reservation with friends in Mayfair, London, on Friday night. 

The Love Island star, 24, nailed business chic in the neutral ensemble which she styled with a Louis Vuitton handbag for her evening essentials.

Francesca wore her signature brunette locks in natural waves which she tucked behind her ear to accentuate her pretty features. 

The TV star kept her accessories to a minimum in the stripped-back look and opted for studs and silver rings for the outing. 

Finishing her look, Francesca highlighted her sun-kissed glow with a dash of bronzer over her cheekbones and a flick of mascara on her fluttery eyelashes.

It comes after Francesca enjoyed a belated birthday celebration for her sister Claudia at Cecconi's in Mayfair, London, on Thursday.

Francesca joined The Mummy Diaries stars Sam and Billie Faiers for the occasion. 

Sam, 29, shared a video of the women, who were joined by another pal, strutting down the street as she declared: 'Start early, finish early', in accordance with the new 10pm curfew enforced to all bars and restaurants in England.

Francesca posed up a storm in a red frock which came in at the waist to accentuate her slim frame and boasted long sleeves. 

It comes after Francesca was spotted cosying up to a new man during a boozy night out in London earlier this summer.

She looked to be on cloud nine as she got up close and personal with Edward Crossan, vice chairman of London-based waste management company Powerday

The TV personality, who is family friends with Edward, put on a very affectionate display with the hunk who was previously been linked to TOWIE's Amber Turner.

In May last year, Edward was seen enjoying a jaunt on a yacht in Ibiza with TOWIE star Amber, 27, who is currently dating Dan Edgar.

The accomplished businessman was named vice chairman of his father's company in January and is featured on the company's website.

MailOnline contacted Francesca's representatives for further comment at the time of publication.
