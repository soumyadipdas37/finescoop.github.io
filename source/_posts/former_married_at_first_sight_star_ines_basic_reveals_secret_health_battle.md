Former Married At First Sight star Ines Basic has opened up about the physical and mental health issues she's been battling recently.

In a new interview on her YouTube channel, the 30-year-old revealed that she was recently diagnosed with scoliosis, which has left her unable to exercise.

'I just found out that I've got scoliosis and I've got some damage to my nerves,' she explained.

'I'm doing spinal recovery treatment, five weeks to go before I can do any form of workout,' she continued. 

Ines, who is a Bosnian refugee, also revealed that she's been in trauma therapy. 

'I always keep it to myself, no one ever sees the work that I put in,' she said.

'If I started showing people it would just look outrageous. People think I'm demonic or something.'

Earlier this year, Ines claimed that the public backlash from her negative portrayal on Married At First Sight left her with PTSD.

'I have experienced so much hatred, death threats, shame about migrating to Australia from another country, racism and more because of what MAFS chose to show of me,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

'I wasn't well during and after [the show], I think that was obvious, but it got even worse last July,' she added.

'That's when it was the most brutal time for me and I was diagnosed with complex PTSD... It was 110 per cent caused from the show.' 

Psychology Today describes PTSD as a mental health condition that can form in response to a traumatic event that happened recently or in the past. 

Ines was branded a 'villain' during the 2019 season of Married At First Sight for her affair with Sam Ball, who was partnered with fan favourite Elizabeth Sobinoff.
