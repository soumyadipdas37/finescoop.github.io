Sam Faiers revealed she 'bawled my eyes out' as she took her son Paul, four, to his first day of school on Thursday.

The Mummy Diaries star, 29, took to Instagram to share a photo of her eldest beaming as he posed in his smart uniform holding a book-bag.

Sam told her followers it was a 'huge milestone' in parenthood, after she and Paul Knightley had previously argued over whether Paul Jr should be homeschooled.

Sam captioned the post: 'When your children are babies in your arms, you think far into the future about school and how it's years away.. well that day was today for us. I'm beyond proud of you my darling. 

'Paul's first day at school honestly it was so emotional for those who aren't there yet, brace yourself he said to me when we was in the car "I love you Mummy, are you going to cry happy tears?". 

'It was like he was reassuring me he was going to be ok I wasn't even crying at this point (then I literally balled my eyes out) it's such a huge milestone and a new chapter of life. I hope everyone else's children settled in nicely ❤️ lots of love x' (sic).

Sam's sister Billie commented on the post: 'My beautiful nephew, we are all so proud of you Paul love you lots'.

Back in February, the television personality revealed they had got Paul into their first choice school after moving from Hertfordshire to Surrey.

Although the reality star admitted it had been a stressful process and they had to view seven schools before making their decision.  

Sam told MailOnline at the time: 'I do think there's something about Surrey, I like the little towns, the villages, the schools and we have got little Paul into a school we both love.

Family: The couple first got together in 2014, shortly after Sam departed TOWIE. They have two children Paul, four, and daughter Rosie, two 

'We viewed quite a few, like six or seven schools, and the one we both loved the most he got accepted a place just under two weeks ago. We are really happy about it.'

Talking about Paul Jr's reaction to starting school, Sam sweetly revealed: 'He came with us on the second viewing, he spent a few hours there and loved it. It was really cute, as we left the school, he said: "Oh I've really loved it there, can I go back tomorrow?"  

Sam also joked that if she and her partner Paul had their own way they would send Paul Jr to school when he was six. 

In tears: 'Paul's first day at school honestly it was so emotional for those who aren't there yet, brace yourself', Sam said

However, despite the two disagreeing about sending Paul Jr to nursery - her partner insisted he stay at home- Sam agreed they are both excited about the new change and Paul is even looking forward to the school run. 

'I said to him, "Well in September, you're going to be coming here for many many years."' 

And it's not just Paul Jr who is excited as Sam admitted her partner Paul, who has always been against sending their son to nursery, is happy too.

She said: 'He actually loves the school as well and gets a really good vibe. We both know that he's ready and Paul is all, "I'm really looking forward to doing the school run everyday", so I'm like, "If you want to do it every morning that's perfectly fine with me!"'

And despite not sending Paul Jr to nursery, Sam revealed that they will be sending daughter Rosie to the same school for its pre-school when she's older. 

Exciting: The reality star, 29, spoke exclusively to MailOnline ahead of the new series of her hit ITVBe show Sam and Billie Faiers: The Mummy Diaries, which hits screens on Wednesday (Paul Jr and Rosie pictured)
