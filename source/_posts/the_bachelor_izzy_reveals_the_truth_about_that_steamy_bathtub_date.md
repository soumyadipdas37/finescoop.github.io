The Bachelor's Izzy Sharman-Firth was sent home during Wednesday night's episode, missing out on a spot in the finale.

And the 29-year-old HR adviser has now revealed the truth behind her most raunchy moment on the show: her bathtub Zoom date with Locky Gilbert.

She told The Courier Mail there was an interesting story behind the date - and also revealed she wasn't alone in the room at the time.

Truth be told: The Bachelor's Izzy Sharman-Firth has revealed the truth about her memorable bathtub date with Locky Gilbert, which took place during 'Love in Lockdown'

'I did have my togs on,' she said, responding to rumours she had been naked on camera.

'I just had my straps down so it looked like I didn't. I was like, "Oh, my boss is going to see it!"' she added. 

Three's company! She told The Courier Mail that she was wearing a swimsuit, even though she looked naked, and also revealed she wasn't alone in the room at the time 

Izzy also revealed she had just one female producer in the room with her.

'She would set up the camera and she was there making sure everything was okay,' she said.

Izzy went on to explain that she was convinced she would make it to the finale, after her connection with Locky grew during coronavirus lockdown.

'He said a lot of things that made me think he was thinking about a future together,' she said, before confirming she now has a boyfriend.

'You don't really know the connections he has with the other girls,' she added.

Hard choices: Before leaving, Locky told Izzy: 'You're so amazing. You bring out the best in me. I've had literally the best time'

Locky gave his final two roses to former friends-turned-rivals Irena Srbinovska and Bella Varelis.

After embracing Bec, it was an emotional Izzy's turn to say goodbye, tearing up as she hugged Locky before he walked her out.

Izzy replied: 'You've also got some amazing girls back there. Good luck.'

In the car, Izzy tearfully told producers: 'I saw myself standing at the end of this whole experience with Locky. I was not expecting tonight to go the way it has. I guess it wasn't meant to be.

'Right now, I'm just feeling really heartbroken. But I wouldn't change anything,' she finished. 

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
