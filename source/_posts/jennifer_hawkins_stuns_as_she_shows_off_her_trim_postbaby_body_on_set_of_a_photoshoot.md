She's a doting mother to daughter Frankie Violet, who she welcomed in October last year. 

And on Thursday, Australian model Jennifer Hawkins showed off her trim post-baby body. 

The 36-year-old former Miss Universe looked nothing short of incredible in a plunging white dress while on set of a photoshoot. 

White hot! On Thursday, Jennifer Hawkins stunned as she showed off her trim post-baby body in a plunging white dress on set of a photoshoot

The blonde shared a photo of herself on set, showing her smiling and sitting on a swing.

Jen's frock featured a plunging neckline, tie up sleeves and a billowing skirt. 

Her look was completed with natural-looking makeup and her long locks out in loose tousled curls.

Jen revealed that she had completed a photoshoot for the baby formula and food brand, Bubs Australia.

In her post, she revealed that Frankie is a 'fussy eater,' but eats solids from the company. 

'I'm really happy that Bubs and I found each other (and so is Frankie),' Jen's post began.

'It's a natural fit for a brand that I'd already chosen to trust when [I] introduced solids to (fussy eater) Frankie.'

She said she uses the solid pouches from the brand for when she's 'on the go' as they're 'convenient.'

Jen also said she uses the brand's goat milk formula for Frankie sometimes, even though she's still breastfeeding, as it's 'gentle on her little tummy.'

Jen finished, writing: 'Mum life heyyy - the pursuit of a well-fed bub!'

Last month, Jen spoke candidly about the challenges she's faced as a new mother. 

The 36-year-old shared an adorable photo while hugging her baby girl on Instagram and wrote: 'One min (sic) they are giggling next tears, sleeping well then nope, fussy on the boob then feeding well (aka teething).'

She continued: 'No day is the same. Wouldn't change any of it. So much love for this little cheeky head.'
