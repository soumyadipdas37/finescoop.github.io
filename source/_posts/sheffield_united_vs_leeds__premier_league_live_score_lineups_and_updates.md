Sheffield United welcome Leeds United to Bramall Lane in the Premier League's first Yorkshire derby in 19 years. Marcelo Bielsa's free-scoring newcomers will be looking to add to the Blades' dismal start to the season.

The hosts are winless in their first two league clashes, and have even failed to find the net at all. Defeats to Wolves on the opening day and Aston Villa last week have dented the aspirations of Chris Wilder's side, and he will hope to see plenty of improvement today.

Leeds, meanwhile, have caught the eye with their impressive displays since returning to the top flight. A 4-3 thriller at Anfield may have seen them endure a losing start, but another seven-goal thriller with Fulham helped them to pick up their first win of the new campaign.

Sportsmail's DANIEL DAVIS will provide live EPL coverage of Sheffield United vs Leeds United including score, lineups and build-up.Â
