She's one of Hollywood's most promising rising stars, and it appears that Ana de Armas is ready for her close-up.

The girlfriend of Ben Affleck is featured in the new issue of Vogue Mexico, in a series of stunning portraits that show off her natural beauty, making it clear how Ben, 48, became so quickly enamored with the Cuban-Spanish actress. 

Ana, 32, looks sensational in the black and white spread, where she poses in a corset and a pair of latex gloves, in a profile that was published Wednesday.

The Knives Out star also gives an extreme close-up to the camera, showing off her flawless complexion while lying on a beach dressed in couture. 

The future Bond Girl and Ben, 48, have caused quite the stir with their relationship - which has played out at warp speed throughout lockdown. 

Known for their big public displays of affection, the duo are rarely seen without each other when spotted out and about.

Meanwhile, Ben's ex-wife Jennifer Garner, who he split with after 10 years in June 2015, is said to be 'happy' he is dating again, according to a report last month in UsWeekly. 

An insider told the publication: 'Although it's sad in a way to see him move on and be so happy, she is ultimately happy that he is happy and in a good and healthy place with his life. 

That's what she ultimately wants for the father of her kids,' they added.

The Hollywood stars have subsequently worked hard to maintain a good relationship with each other for the sake of their children.

The source added that Jennifer is 'always polite and trusts Ben and lets him do what he wants when he's with the kids'.

Ana and Ben first connected on the set of the thriller film Deep Water in 2019 where they star as a married couple who have fallen out of love.

They took their relationship public in March when they were seen enjoying a vacation in Costa Rica and Ana's native Cuba.

Earlier this month, a insider claimed that Ana has been wowed by Ben and Jennifer's co-parenting skills.
