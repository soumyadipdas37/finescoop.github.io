Christian Brueckner, 43, had challenged the arrest warrant issued over a 2005 rape charge in relation to a separate case 

The prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case has bid to get out of jail rejected as the European Court of Justice ruled his extradition was legal.  

Christian Brueckner, 43, had challenged an arrest warrant issued over a 2005 rape charge in relation to a separate case.

He had been extradited from Italy to Germany under the warrant in 2018.

But the European Court of Justice earlier today found the conviction justified because Italian authorities, who had handed the German suspect over to German authorities, had given their consent for him to be prosecuted for that separate rape case.   

Brueckner, who is is currently in a prison in Kiel, north Germany, will remain behind bars.

In June, Brueckner was identified the German man as a suspect in the case of Madeleine McCann.

The young girl disappeared from an apartment in 2007 while her family was on holiday in the resort of Praia da Luz, Portugal. 

The suspect was living nearby at the time of Madeleine's disappearance and telephone data suggests he was near the apartment just hours before she was last seen. 

But authorities say they do not have enough evidence to hold him in prison on the strength of the McCann case alone.
