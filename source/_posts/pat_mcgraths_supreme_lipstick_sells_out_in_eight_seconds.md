Supreme's first venture into the beauty industry proved to be a phenomenal success after the streetwear brand's lipstick collaboration with celebrity makeup artist Pat McGrath sold out in just eight seconds. 

The $38 lipstick, which was released on Supreme's website on Thursday, prompted a frenzy of excitement from beauty lovers and streetwear fans alike, with thousands of people clamoring to lay their hands on the makeup item. 

But many were met with bitter disappointment after the lip shade - aptly-named Supreme - which was inspired by the brand's iconic logo, disappeared in mere seconds both in the US and in the UK. 

Going, going, gone! Celebrity makeup artist Pat McGrath's Supreme lipstick collaboration sold out just eight seconds after being released online on Thursday  

Too much hype! The $38 lipstick - which is aptly-named Supreme - was the New York-based streetwear brand's first foray into beauty in its 26-year history 

'[The lipstick] went live at 11am ET and sold out in eight seconds flat,' a spokesperson for Pat McGrath told DailyMail.com, adding: 'The UK sold out in 8.2 seconds.'

Supreme's collaboration with Pat's eponymous makeup brand, Pat McGrath Labs, marked the New York-based label's first ever beauty partnership it its 26-year history. 

While the lipstick was Supreme's first foray into makeup, it seems to have gone the way of so many of the streetwear brand's previous collaborations, with savvy buyers offering it up on re-sale websites for more than 26 times the original price. 

On StockX, the lipstick was being sold by dozens of users, with one asking for a whopping $999 for a single tube. Others offered the product up for anywhere between $100 and $300 - a far cry from its original price of $38.  

Twitter users were quick to share their thoughts on the lipstick's sell-out success, with some people taking to the site to express their joy at securing one of the products, while others vented their fury at missing out. 

'OK but like I actually would have bought the Pat McGrath Supreme lipstick to wear and some little s**t took his a** straight to StockX with it,' one beauty lover wrote. 

Pricey! Within minutes of being released on the Supreme website, the lipstick had been posted on resale website StockX by dozens of savvy buyers - with some asking for hundreds of dollars

Woah! Some people were offering the lipstick for up to $999 - more than 26 times its original $38 price 











Upset: Several people took to Twitter to share their sadness at missing out on the product 

Another person agreed, tweeting: 'Supreme x Pat McGrath lipstick going for $117 on StockX. Man listen, this is next level tweaking.' 

'Supreme turned all these females into Hypebeasts with this Pat McGrath collab,' another commented. 

One upset father chimed in: 'Damn you Supreme I only wanted the Pat McGrath lipstick for my daughter... two damn minutes sold out while I was checking out with one in my cart.'  

The lipstick collaboration between the streetwear giant and the celebrity beauty guru was first announced last month, with both brands revealing that the product would make its debut as part of Supreme's Fall/Winter 2020 collection.  

Described by Pat herself as an 'iconic red', the vibrant hue is an exclusive version of the makeup artist's much-loved MatteTrance Lipstick, a 'high-intensity hydrating pigment' that is designed to pack a serious and long-lasting color punch, without drying out the pout.   



Success! A few Twitter users celebrated their purchasing success 

Hot item: The Supreme lipstick was housed in Pat McGrath Labs' signature packaging, but with a bold red twist in honor of the brand's iconic logo  

Tease: The collaboration was first announced online last month, prompting a frenzy of excitement from beauty lovers and streetwear fans alike 

The lipstick is housed in Pat's iconic gilded tube, which features a pair of gold lips where the lid meets the base. 

However, the packaging for the Supreme collaboration comes in the streetwear brand's iconic red, and features its white logo along the side. 

Unsurprisingly, news of the collaboration between Pat - who counts the likes of Naomi Campbell and Cardi B among her celebrity clientele - and Supreme sparked a firestorm of excitement on social media. 

Instagram users were left in a frenzy by the announcement, with many questioning when the product will be released, and how they can ensure they get their hands on it. 

'This is going to be MAJOR! Hope I can get my hands on it,' one person wrote, while another added: 'I must have this!'  

'Too major to handle!' a third chimed in, while dozens of others simply shared their excitement by flooding Pat's Instagram with heart-eye emojis.
