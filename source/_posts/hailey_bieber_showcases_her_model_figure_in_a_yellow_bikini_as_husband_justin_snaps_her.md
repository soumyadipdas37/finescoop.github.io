She has been enjoying a vacation in the mountains with her husband Justin Bieber. 

And Hailey Bieber beamed a bright smile while showing off her toned figure in a bikini, as her pop star husband snapped the picture. 

Justin, 26, shared the photo of the 23-year-old model, who he has been married to for nearly two years, to his Instagram Stories on Tuesday.

Hailey sat at a wooden table and revealed her yellow scrunched bikini under a large plush jacket. 

The suit featured a bandeau top and high-cut bottoms showing off much of her toned figure. 

Going fresh faced without a visible drop of makeup, Hailey closed her eyes and gave a gentle smile to the camera, with her chin tilted in the air. 

Close to anniversary: Justin and Hailey wed in a courthouse during the fall of 2018 and had a lavish ceremony last year, they will celebrate two years of marriage this November 

She held one arm of her floral and plaid jacket back showing off the small bikini underneath. 

For an easy look, Hailey tied her blonde hair up in a messy bun with pieces ruffled and falling around her face. 

Sure to add some simple touches to her look, she added gold hoop earrings.

It comes after Justin and Hailey recently caused some controversy when he broke social distancing guidelines to throw a party at his Beverly Hills mansion.  

They threw a huge bash last Sunday at their $8.5million abode, attended by celeb pals like Hudson, Jaden Smith, Winnie Harlow, Kendall and Kylie Jenner.

Guests were spotted gathering outside the 6,132-square-foot Monterey Colonial home, none of them wearing face masks.
