Khloe Kardashian flashed a bit of leg in a white robe as she posed up a storm on her Instagram this Thursday.

The 36-year-old was a sizzling sensation in full hair and makeup including a bob redolent of the 1920s despite her dressed-down ensemble.

She posed for a couple of dressing room snapshots including one where she sipped a beverage through a straw.

Pulling her best supermodel stares for her 121 million Instagram followers she modeled a pair of glittering earrings.

Khloe was plugging the last season premiere of Keeping Up With The Kardashians which had its cancellation announced early this month.

The show soldiered on for 18 seasons after it first started in 2007 and made superstars out of all the Kardashian-Jenner siblings.

Her Instagram plug comes in the wake of a Page Six report alleging that she and Scott Disick were against the cancellation.

By way of explaining their opposition to the cancellation the insider said: 'Some of them needed the money more than others.'

Scott shares three children with Khloe's eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian - sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight. 

Although there were rumors that Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, as well as Kylie Jenner, pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.

The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.

Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'

To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'

However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.
