Angel Di Maria has launched a broadside at Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni after being left out of his latest squad.

The Paris Saint-Germain star was not included in Scaloni's selection for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Bolivia.

And the 32-year-old has suggested that the likes of Lionel Messi, 33, and Sergio Aguero, 32, should also be dropped if Scaloni is keen on bringing through younger players.

Di Maria told Clos Continental: 'I can't find an explanation, I have no words. For me, Argentina is the best.

'At my club it's to try to have a chance with the national team and compete. It's difficult to understand that being in good form, I'm not called up.

'If I'm not called, it's because they don't want me, but I will keep fighting to be in the team.

'I'm old at 32? If we start to think about replacements, we should do it with everyone.

'For that, Messi, Aguero and Nicolas Otamendi shouldn't go and others who are in great form.

'Many say that I'm old but I still run the same way and I can be at the same level as Kylian Mbappe and Neymar.

'I've been in good form for 18 months and haven't been called up. I'll continue to show that I'm capable of being in the squad.

'I wish with all of my soul to wear the shirt again. Every time I play a good game or become a better player, I only think about being called up.

'It's true I've been involved for 12 years but it's my dream and I want to be included.'

Di Maria, who has made 102 appearances for Argentina, did enjoy an excellent season with PSG, scoring 12 goals and contributing 23 assists as they reached the Champions League final.

However, he has been banned for four Ligue 1 matches after spitting at Marseille's Alvaro Gonzalez during a fiery match that saw five red cards.

Aguero wasn't included in the latest Argentina squad as he continues his comeback from knee surgery.
