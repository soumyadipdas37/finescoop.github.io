She's a doting mother to her two daughters.

And Amanda Holden has made the most of their old playhouse by transforming it into an incredible comfy home for her two rabbits Princess and Beatrice.

The TV presenter, 49, is thought to have spent £6,000 to up-cycle the space for her beloved pets who can now enjoy their own porch and bunk beds, reports The Sun.

In pictures seen by the publication the inside of the playhouse turned luxury hut shows wicker chairs and a cushion with the BGT judge's face on.

Amanda has also shared snaps of her sage green garden house before revealing that it boasts a mini porch and pretty white windows.

While celebrating Easter earlier this year Amanda's youngest daughter Hollie was even seen doing an egg hunt near the bunny house. 

A source said: 'Amanda loves these rabbits, and they're treasured members of the family. It's only right they live like starlets.' 

MailOnline has also contacted Amanda Holden's representative.

It comes after Amanda entertained her fans with a sassy video of her flicking her hair alongside radio co-presenter Ashley Roberts on Tuesday.

Amanda captioned the fun clip with 'because we're worth it' followed by a crying laughing emoji.

In the slow motion video, the two stars strutted down the hallway in sync as they sultrily flicked their blonde locks in time.

Amanda styled her blonde locks into a glossy blow-dried hairdo and added a slick of glamorous make-up.

Meanwhile Ashley looked effortlessly chic in a pair of white high-waisted trousers with an unbuttoned shirt tucked into them.

It comes after Amanda made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday.

The presenter slipped into a plunging gold metallic dress as she took her place on the socially-distanced judging panel 

Amanda was in high spirits after being promoted to head judge for the semi-finals, as it was also revealed that her debut album Songs From My Heart had reached number one on the iTunes pre-order charts.  

Due to Simon Cowell's absence Amanda has been promoted to head judge, and she was quick to joke she'll be backing 'musical theatre all the way.' 

Simon was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. 

The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.  

Wow! It comes after Amanda made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday
