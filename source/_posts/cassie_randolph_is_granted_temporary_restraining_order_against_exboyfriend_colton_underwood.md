There will be a hearing in October where Colton will be able to tell his side of the story, TMZ reported Monday. 

The 25-year-old fell for Colton on season 23 of The Bachelor which aired in early 2019 but the couple split in May.

As well as planting the tracking device, Cassie claims Colton turned up uninvited at her various residences among other allegations, according to TMZ.  

Cassie also noted their split as mid-April, though they announced the breakup in May 2020, one and a half years after they ended up together on the dating show.  

Colton, 28, now must stay at least 100 yards away from Cassie, her home, her work and must not contact her and avoid all threatening behaviour.

The former contestant claimed Underwood taped a tracking device to the bottom of her car's back bumper to track her whereabouts, which she said he confessed to doing.  

She also claims that Underwood, 28, has been showing a pattern of showing up uninvited to her Los Angeles apartment and her parent's Huntington Beach house, where the couple spent part of coronavirus lockdown. 

Underwood also recovered from coronavirus at her family's home. 

Randolph went on to allege that he takes 'obsessive walks' to her apartment and lingered outside of her bedroom window at her parent's beach house at 2 A.M., according to the outlet.  

Along with physical behavior, Randolph also claimed that the former football player has been sending her harassing text messages accusing her of spending time with her ex-boyfriend, among other messages.

In the paperwork, Randolph also alleged that Underwood sent anonymous text messages to her and himself to say he was also the victim of a stalker, though she claims he later confessed to that as well. 

DailyMail.com has reached out to Underwood's rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. 

The allegations reportedly come as a surprise to the former NFL player, who has allegedly not spoke with Randolph in over a month, according to Us Weekly.

'He's been in Colorado and this was all a surprise. He was completely blindsided,' the source said.  

Since announcing their split earlier this year, Randolph and Underwood have had public dust ups about their relationship and break up. 

Over for months: Randolph cited their split as April 2020 though they announced their split in May, they met on season 23 of The Bachelor, he gave her the final rose but did not propose on the reality TV show. Seen in April 2019

In July, Randolph accused her ex of trying to 'monetize' their split by writing about it in the upcoming second edition of his book without her prior approval and though they agreed to remain silent on the reasons of the split.  

 'I have gained so much clarity about what I want and more importantly what I need in a relationship,' she wrote at the time. 'I'm so excited for this next chapter of my life with new stories and new people. I can't thank y'all enough for your understanding and your support during this time.' 

Adding: 'I would like to place on public record & ask you politely to refrain from discussing our relationship, as we agreed... I would also like to ask that you don't cloud our great, 11/2 year relationship with a messy breakup. ' 

'When our relationship ended we agreed to handle things as privately as possible as we attempted to navigate our new relationship as friends,' Underwood wrote to Instagram after Randolph appeared in a short segment for The Bachelor: Greatest Seasons of All Time. 'I chose to do that since we were living in this interim period, but obviously a lot changed this week.'

Though Underwood later accused The Bachelor franchise of manipulating and taking advantage of Randolph following their breakup.  

She declined to divulge much information, however, Underwood said he was upset to see how Chris and The Bachelor franchise focused solely on their split, it has been claimed.

'Cass stayed extremely professional and extremely quiet about our breakup,' Colton said during an interview with Reality Steve. 'What bugged me was the fact that that show took advantage of her.'

'Its been a crazy few months to say the least, Cass and I have been doing a lot of self-reflecting. Sometimes people are just meant to be friends - and that's okay,' the former NFL player captioned a black and white snap of them from behind.

He added: 'We both have grown immensely and been through so much together - so this isn't the end of our story, it's the start of a whole new chapter for us.' 

Then  Randolph shared a series of snaps from their relationship with a number of shots with her arms wrapped around Underwood.  

Earlier this year, Colton said he could see them getting engaged by the end of 2020.

'If she were here, she'd nudge me for saying this, but I think an engagement is something we'd both like to see this year,' he said. 

'To put it very frank, after the show, we realized we weren't communicating as well as we once did,' he wrote in his memoir The First Time
