They shocked fans when they left Triple J Breakfast for Adelaide's Nova 91.9 last October, after three years with the government-funded radio station.

But Ben Harvey and Liam Stapleton's big gamble has paid off. 

The duo now have the most popular commercial radio show in the South Australian state.
