Jameela Jamil has revealed that three former lovers all made same comparison after sleeping with her, claiming it was like having sex with a memory foam mattress. 

The Good Place star, 34, admitted her exes have dished out the comments on her love-making skills - which she believes were a compliment - in a candid new interview.

Jameela – who has been in a relationship with singer James Blake, 31, since 2015 – also said her attempts to crack jokes in the bedroom don't go down well.

Speaking on the Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast, she said: 'Sex in itself is so stupid. The thrusting? What are we doing? I'm not amazing in bed. But I've got big boobs so I don't have to be. 

'Some of the reviews I've had… I've been told by three separate men that making love to me – and I think they meant this as a compliment – was like having sex with a memory foam mattress.

'I shift to any shape. It's not that I'm bendy, it's that I don't have muscles anywhere but my heart. I'm like a human marshmallow with nipples.'

Speaking about the jokes she makes during sex, she added: 'Mostly if I can just stay silent that's enough because it's my trying to insert comedy in the bedroom that goes down badly.' 

Jameela also relayed a bedroom mishap that made her quip: ­'Unexpected item in bagging area.' 

She said of their reaction: 'It was the angriest I've ever seen someone look.'

Earlier this month Jameela said that surviving her suicide attempt seven years ago has proved to be 'the most extraordinary gift'.

The actress took to Instagram last Thursday to mark World Suicide Prevention Day, expressing her joy at having survived, while she gushed about the things in her life she now gets to enjoy – including her romance with James Blake.

Nothing that she can now help others, Jameela wrote: 'Surviving suicide has been the most extraordinary gift to me in being able to still be here and remind the people I love that sometimes it's just a particularly overwhelming hour, day, week or month.

 'And that it can and normally will pass, and that with even small incremental changes and reaching out to even just one person for help, life really can get better. Please hang on. #suicidepreventionday.'

She further captioned the heartwarming image: 'Glad I stuck around in the end. Got to meet my two Favourite lads. #suicidepreventionday.'

In 2019, Jameela revealed that she had attempted her own life six years prior, noting that she was 'lucky' to be alive.

She wrote on Twitter at the time: 'Today is #WorldMentalHealthDay. This month, six years ago, I tried to take my own life. I'm so lucky that I survived, and went on to use EMDR to treat my severe PTSD.'
