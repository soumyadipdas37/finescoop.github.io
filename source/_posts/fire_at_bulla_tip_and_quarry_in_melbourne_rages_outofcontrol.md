A huge fire raging out of control at a notorious rubbish dump has left parts of Melbourne engulfed in clouds of thick black smoke. 

Fire crews were called to the Bulla Tip and Quarry on Sunbury Road, Bulla in the city's north-west at 6.15am on Tuesday.

Firefighters found a large pile of rubbish measuring 6,400sqm on fire and smoke billowing into the air.

A huge fire has ravished out of control at a rubbish tip causing thick, black smoke to engulf parts of Melbourne 

Nineteen Country Fire Authority (CFA) vehicles and crews from Fire Rescue Victoria attended the scene and battled to control the blaze. 

A warning has been issued to residents in Bulla, Diggers Rest, Greenvale, Keilor North, Melbourne Airport, Oaklands Junction, Sunbury and Wildwood.

Residents within a 5km radius have been asked to keep their windows closed and avoid the area as crews continue to fight the massive fire.

A witness told 3AW that the blaze was at the front of the rubbish tip. 

'It's right on top, on the road, it's not at the back,' he said. 

The fire comes more than two years after the tip was shut down by the Environment Protection Authority due to exposed asbestos, subsurface fires and safety hazards.

'Bulla Tip and Quarry (BTQ) is under new management and is working closely with EPA Victoria to restore this facility,' the tip states on its website.
