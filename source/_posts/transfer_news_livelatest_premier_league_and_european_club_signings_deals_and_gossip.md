The new Premier League season is fast approaching and clubs are working around the clock to bolster their squads before another long campaign.

Real Madrid are reportedly prepared to pay half of Gareth Bale's wages to get him off their wage bill, while Manchester United are continuing talks with Borussia Dortmund over Jadon Sancho's transfer fee.  

Here, Sportsmail's Jack Kinnersley will provide live updates from the Premier League and European clubs as they continue to negotiate and complete signings during this window.

Chelsea are well stocked in midfield themselves and would like to add a younger holding player with West Ham's Declan Rice and Lille's Boubakary Soumare among those fancied by Frank Lampard.

Jorginho, 28, is considered more expendable and, after their outlay this summer, Lampard recognises the club have to consider ways of balancing the books.

Today could be another huge day in the transfer window with so many big deals still be done. Stay tuned right here so you know all the latest news first.
