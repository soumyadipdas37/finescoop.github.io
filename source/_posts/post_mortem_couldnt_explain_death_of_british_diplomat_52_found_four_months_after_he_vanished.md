Mystery continues to surround the death of a British diplomat whose body was found in a forest four months after he vanished near his £1million home. 

Richard Morris, 52, was last seen going out for a jog near his home in Hampshire in May. 

Nearly four months later, a member of the public found his body in Alice Holt Forest, around three miles from his home.

An inquest has opened into the father and former ambassador to Nepal's death.

Senior coroner Christopher Wilkinson heard a post-mortem failed to establish a cause of death.  

Police, who are not treating the death as suspicious, had previously spent days combing the dense woodland for any sign of the married father of three.

Richard Morris vanished after leaving his £1million Hampshire home in May, his body was found in a forest less than three miles away on August 31

Mr Morris was the ambassador to Nepal between 2015 and November 2019 and accompanied the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, on a tour of the country in 2016.

He was last seen on the morning of May 6, having left his detached home in the village of Bentley, which sits by the Hampshire and Surrey border, to go running.

Police spent days combing through Alice Holt Forest after the keen runner's disappearance and on August 31 his body was discovered in the woodland site.

The father-of-three was formerly the UK Ambassador to Nepal between 2015 and 2019 (pictured with Prince Harry in 2016)

The forest, around two and a half miles from Mr Morris' home, is where he would regularly go for park runs.

Christopher Wilkinson, senior coroner for Hampshire, said he will gather reports from Mr Morris' GP as he investigates how the diplomat died.

At Winchester Coroner's Court, Mr Wilkinson said: 'The body of a male believed to be Mr Morris was found at Alice Holt enclosure on August 31.

A post-mortem on Mr Morris' body has failed to ascertain a cause of death at this stage, an inquest has heard

'Identification was carried out by DNA and at the time of this inquest opening the deceased has been formally identified.

'The brief circumstances are that Mr Morris was located deceased by a member of the public, having been reported missing from his home in May. 

'A post-mortem was carried out by Russell Delaney, a consultant forensic pathologist, and in his opinion the cause of death is unascertained.'

Mr Wilkinson set a full inquest for June 23 next year.

Last week his devastated family paid tribute to the 'loving husband and father'.

They said: 'From childhood European holidays via a US university scholarship to Ambassador to Nepal, Richard loved to travel.

'Described as 'funny, kind and smart' by his diplomatic colleagues, he worked for the FCO with professionalism and integrity for nearly 30 years.

'His empathy and kindness to those around him earned him respect wherever he went, evidenced by the messages of love, friendship and support we have received from all over the world.

Hampshire Police scoured Alice Holt Forest in May, following the senior diplomat's disappearance, but he wasn't found until August

'Richard was always a runner, cheerfully describing himself as 'more of an enthusiastic weekend trail runner than podium finisher'.

'Nevertheless he had completed five marathons on four continents, most recently in Nepal, where he raised money for Changing Faces - the UK charity of which he was a trustee.

'But above all else, Richard was a family man. A loving and loyal husband, father, son and brother. He showed us the world but he was our world and we are devastated by his loss.
