Melbourne autistic teen William Wall has been found dead, 22 hours after he went missing in Melbourne's outskirts.

The 14-year-old went missing after he went for his daily jog along the Yarra Ranges' Warburton Trail at 6.45am on Tuesday, promising his family he would be back in 15 minutes. 

He never returned to his home in Launching Place. 

Victoria Police confirmed his body had been found in Yarra Junction during the second day of the search on Wednesday afternoon.

His death is not being treated as suspicious and police will prepare a report for the Coroner.

Earlier on Wednesday, locals fumed after being advised to keep an eye out for William, but not to breach Victoria's COVID-19 restrictions by limiting outdoor time to two hours.

'In line with coronavirus restrictions, at this stage we do not require any assistance from the public,' a post on the Eyewatch Yarra Ranges Police Facebook read on Tuesday night. 

'We want to say a big thank you however, for the all the offers we have received.' 

More to come.
