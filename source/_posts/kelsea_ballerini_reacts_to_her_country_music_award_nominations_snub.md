Kelsea Ballerini was not given one Country Music Award nomination on Tuesday morning as Miranda Lambert, Luke Combs and Maren Morris were shined upon.

The crooner reacted with her head held high, however, as the 26-year-old took to social media.

'Last time this happened, I wrote homecoming queen the next day about the feeling,' the siren wrote on Twitter. She was referring to her hit song kelsea she wrote after being left out of the ACM Awards in 2019 and debuted in March of this year.

How she feels: Kelsea Ballerini was not given one Country Music Award nomination on Tuesday morning as Miranda Lambert, Luke Combs and Maren Morris were shined upon. Seen over the weekend on the beach

'Something beautiful will undoubtedly come from the current disappointment.'

Ballerini then held her head high and said: 'Nonetheless, congratulations to my friends & peers that got nominations. Proud to be a part of the country family, always.'

Her husband Morgan Evans added a red heart to her note.

The 54th Annual CMA Awards will air November 11 (8:00, 11:00 PM/EST) on ABC. 

The CMA nominations were announced on Tuesday morning. 

Luke Combs and Carly Pearce shared the news on Good Morning America with Ingrid Andress and Gabby Barrett listing off more names on YouTube and Facebook livestream.

Lambert has the most nominations with seven, Combs has six and Morris got five.

Also noteworthy is Justin Bieber landed his very first CMA nod for his song 10,000 Hours with duo Dan + Shay. 

That tune was noticed in the single of the year, musical event of the year and music video of the year categories. 

Justin's wife, supermodel Hailey Bieber, was featured prominently in the gushy video. 

Good girl! Miranda Lambert (pictured in 2019), Luke Combs and Maren Morris lead the pack for the Country Music Awards nominations which were announced on Tuesday morning

Happy man: Luke Combs, seen with Nicole Hocking in 2018, has the second most nods

And this year was the first time in 10 years that two women have been nominated in the entertainer of the year category.

Those ladies are Lambert and awards favorite Carrie Underwood of Cry Pretty fame. 

Usually that category has mostly men in it.

A good year for her: Morris has come in third place with a total of five nominations

The last time two women were nominated in that group was when Lambert and Lady A were listed in 2010.

The Female Vocalists of the Year are an impressive collection of talent: Lambert, Ashley McBryde, Morris, Kacey Musgraves and Underwood. 

In the Male category are Eric Church, Combs, Thomas Rhett, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban.  

New to it all: Also noteworthy is Justin Bieber landed his very first CMA nod for his song 10,000 Hours with duo Dan + Shay. Justin's wife Hailey Bieber was featured prominently in the gushy video; seen on Monday

New hope: And this year was the first time in 10 years that two women have been nominated in the entertainer of the year category. Those ladies are Lambert and Carrie Underwood (pictured)
