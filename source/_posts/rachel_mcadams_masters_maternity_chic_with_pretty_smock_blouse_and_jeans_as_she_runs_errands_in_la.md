Back in November 2018, McAdams described motherhood as 'the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.'

In an interview with Britain's The Sunday Times, she explained people had told her her life wouldn't be her own anymore after having a child.

She said: 'I had 39 years of me, I was sick of me, I was so happy to put the focus on some other person.'

The Canadian actress added: 'I waited a long time.... And I didn't want to do it before it was the right time.'
