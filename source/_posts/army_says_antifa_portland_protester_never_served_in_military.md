An Antifa member under investigation connected to the death of a man shot at a Portland protest claimed he served in the Army – but the Pentagon says otherwise, DailyMail.com can disclose.

Michael Reinoehl is being reportedly being investigated by Portland police over the killing of Aaron ‘Jay’ Danielson, a member of the right wing group Patriot Prayer who was shot to death at a protest on Saturday.

Reinoehl had previously claimed on social media and in an interview with Bloomberg that he ‘was in the army’.

‘I was in the army and I hated it. I did not feel like fighting for them would ever be a good cause. Today’s protesters and antifa are my brothers in arms,’ Reinoehl wrote in a post about violent protests.

‘Every Revolution needs people that are willing and ready to fight. I am 100% ANTIFA all the way! I am willing to fight for my brothers and sisters!’

But a US Army spokesperson told DailyMail.com they searched their service records for a 48-year-old Michael Forest Reinoehl and were ‘unable to locate this individual in our database.’

The Stolen Valor Act of 2013 states it is a federal crime to fraudulently claim military service in order to get money or any other kind of benefit. Police have not commented and Reinoehl has not been charged with any crime in connection to Saturday night's violence. However his sister told DailyMail.com she believed he was the man in a video of the deadly shooting – and had identified her brother to Portland detectives investigating the murder 

In this post, from June 16, he claimed to have served in the army and 'hated it'. He also wrote he was 100% 'ANTIFA' and says 'We do not want violence but we will not run from it either'

However his sister told DailyMail.com she believed he was the man in a video of the deadly shooting – and had identified her brother to Portland detectives investigating the murder.

Reinoehl had been previously accused of taking a loaded gun to an earlier Portland protest and social media posts show him attending Black Lives Matter protests.

And the 48-year-old former professional snowboarder has had several previous run-ins with the police. In June, he was charged for allegedly racing with his 17-year-old son at speeds of up to 111mph on Interstate 84 with his 11-year-old daughter in the passenger seat.

Police said they found ‘usable amounts of marijuana and unidentified prescription pills’ in Reinoehl’s 2005 Cadillac STS and a loaded, concealed Glock pistol.

The father of two was charged with driving under the influence of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of a firearm.

The victim of Saturday night's shooting in Portland was Aaron 'Jay' Danielson. He was a member of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer and also used the last name Bishop 

Reinoehl's sister April, 36, believes the man caught on camera in a shooting in the downtown area of the riot-torn Oregon city was her brother – and even identified him to local police. This is one of the videos that was circulating on social media from Saturday's shooting. It's unclear if this is the image Reinoehl's sister April  had seen

Police arrived on the scene 'within a minute' of when gunshots rang out. The victim, later identified as Danielson, is seen wearing a hat with the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group whose members have frequently clashed with protesters in Portland in the past

Danielson’s ex Mindy Kobata told DailyMail.com she was shocked not only to hear her former boyfriend had been shot dead, but that he had been a member of a right wing religious group

The 39-year-old victim of Saturday’s deadly shooting was part of a caravan of Trump supporters that drove through downtown Portland that night in an event organized by right wing group Patriot Prayer.

Danielson’s ex Mindy Kobata told DailyMail.com she was shocked not only to hear her former boyfriend had been shot dead, but that he had been a member of a right wing religious group.

Kobata, who dated Danielson in the mid 2000s, said he was ‘liberal’ and ‘never religious’.

‘I dated him over 10 years ago, so when I saw the news about him it was a shock, but I haven’t had contact with him for years,’ the 38-year-old said.

‘Back when I knew him he was never really into politics, he was never religious or any of that. He didn’t have strong views on any of those things.

'When I knew him he was a free thinker, more on the liberal side. So I was surprised to hear everything. He was never strongly for or against anything. He was just open to everything, though I don’t know which way he voted.

‘He wasn’t part of [Patriot Prayer] when I knew him, I didn’t know about any of that.’
