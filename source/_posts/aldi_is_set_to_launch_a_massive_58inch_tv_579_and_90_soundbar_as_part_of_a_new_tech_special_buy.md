Budget supermarket giant Aldi Australia is set to launch a home entertainment technology range as part of their popular Special Buys on Saturday September 19.

The new products that will be sure to capture the attention of shoppers include a 58-inch Ultra HD Android TV for just $579 and a slick soundbar that will cost you $90.

While the buys will be available across Aldi store locations, customers should act quickly as only a limited number of stock will be sold.

The television has a huge 146-centimetre screen and is priced at $579, while televisions of similar sizes cost at least $700 from alternative brands. 

The smart technology works with Google Assistant and has quick access to Netflix and YouTube via the allocated buttons on the remote.

The high dynamic range and 4K ultra high definition means movies, shows and videos can be watched in a great quality.
