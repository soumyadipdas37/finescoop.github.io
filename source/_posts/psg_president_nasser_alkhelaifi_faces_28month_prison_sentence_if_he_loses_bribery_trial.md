Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi is facing a prison sentence of more than two years if he is convicted in his World Cup TV rights bribery trial. 

Al-Khelaifi is accused of offering former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke use of his villa in Sardinia, Italy, as a favour ahead of the television rights process for the 2026 and 2030 competitions.

The Swiss Federal Criminal Court in Bellinzona was told on Tuesday that beIN Media Group was awarded the rights in Middle East and Africa, without being put up for tender.

Al-Khelaifi is also the chairman of the Qatari broadcast group, who insist they paid full market value for the rights.  

According to reports from the proceedings, Valcke requested help buying the Italian house during the negotiations between FIFA and beIN.

Al-Khelaifi then bought the property for €5million, before handing it over to a close associate's brother, from whom Valcke gained access to it.

The value of the rent Valcke avoided paying is argued to be about £1.66million. 

Prosecutors have called for a 28-month sentence for Al-Khelaifi if he is found guilty. They have asked for a three-year sentence for Valcke if the same verdict is passed on him. 

Both men deny the charges and the trial continues.
