There are few catchphrases more closely associated with the Bachelor franchise than 'can I steal you for a minute?'

But it seems Locky Gilbert grew tired of the constant interruptions at the cocktail parties, and eventually had to excuse himself to calm down.

According to New Idea, the 31-year-old thrill seeker asked producers for a breather after spending hours being pulled in different directions by the women.

While Locky understood the whole point of the cocktail parties was for the women to get his attention, he still found the experience stressful.

He didn't enjoy having a string of women 'jumping in to have a chat' and reportedly told his producer he 'couldn't handle it', a source said.

The former Australian Survivor star apparently requested a time-out after one of the women interrupted his private time with rumoured winner Irena Srbinovska.

He excused himself from the cocktail party to 'calm down', then returned an hour later and 'acted as if nothing had happened'.

There is no suggestion that Locky was rude to the contestants, just that he needed time out to cool down after a stressful evening. 

Daily Mail Australia understands that many of the women did actually want to give Locky space, but were encouraged to interrupt him by the producers.
