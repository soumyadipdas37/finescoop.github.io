A $200million redevelopment plan for Sydney's iconic harbour has sparked outrage from design experts who fear the landmark could turn into a monumental eyesore.

Circular Quay includes world-famous attractions such as the Sydney Opera House and has been subject to a series of architectural disasters over the years.

One of the most prominent calamities is the hated 'Toaster' apartment complex that has lined the walkway to the renowned performing arts building, blocking the view to the Botanical Gardens since the 1990s. 

Architects fear Transport for NSW, which is overseeing the redevelopment, prioritised budget over design, citing concerns the area will become 'Toaster 2.0'. 

A costly makeover to modernise the neglected waterfront was announced by former Premier Mike Baird in 2015, to begin four years later.

Officials are now claiming construction won't begin until 2023 pending final government approvals.

The state's transport agency has now given two large architecture companies, Plenary Group and CQC Partners, the green light to submit designs with no public consultation. 

Clinton Cole, managing director of CplusC, was shocked when he realised the government had decided upon the two design groups without wider discussion.

Mr Cole asked his team-of-eleven to create their own vision for Circular Quay to show what a smaller company could do (pictured)

'You can only think the worst given the system in place. Compare the Opera House and the Toaster - one is an icon known throughout the world and one is an eyesore,' he told news.com.au.

'Circular Quay will end up being Toaster 2.0. It's a disgrace.'

He said an architectural brief should have been developed based on public feedback.

Mr Cole asked his team-of-eleven to create their own vision for Circular Quay to show what a smaller company could do, while maintaining government stipulations such as keeping current road and rail structures.

The concrete Cahill Expressway, which runs through the area, would be decorated with greenery, cycle paths and lookouts - similar to New York's famous High Line.

Streets would also be lined with public spaces, cafes and farmers markets. 

Mr Cole urged the government to create a public competition to ensure the public space caters to the needs of the taxpayers.

'This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and you can't take a project with this level of cultural significance and give it to a consortium of multibillionaires whose primary objective is to make money for shareholders.'

Transport for NSW said that the design process had been 'conducted equitably and transparently'.

'The NSW government has been engaging with the community on this project since it was first committed to in 2015. Subject to receiving all necessary approvals, construction is earmarked to commence in 2023.'
