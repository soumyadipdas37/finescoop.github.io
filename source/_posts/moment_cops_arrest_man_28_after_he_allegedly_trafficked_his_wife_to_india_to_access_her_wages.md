A man who allegedly trafficked his wife to India and stole more than $60,000 from her family faces 12 years in jail.

The 28-year-old from Darwin is accused of tricking his wife, 27, into flying to India alone in February 2019 by telling her the trip was to secure a US visa. 

Police allege he was physically abusive and threatened the woman to gain access to her wages, bank account and take money from her family.

He was charged with one count of exit trafficking a person through deception in Darwin Local Court on Friday.

The man also allegedly gave false and misleading information to the Federal Court during divorce proceedings he initiated in January 2020. 

Australian Federal Police began their investigation following a tip-off from the public.

The woman has since returned to Australia and is receiving support from police and the Red Cross.

Detective Superintendent Paula Hudson worked closely with the Department of Home Affairs to investigate this matter.

'This is a reminder that forcing someone to leave Australia using coercion, threats or deception is an offence under our laws, and Commonwealth human trafficking offences and penalties apply,' she said.

'Human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices are happening here in Australia and it is up to all of us to work together to protect people who are vulnerable to these exploitative crime types.' 

The AFP received 223 reports of human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like offences between July 2019 and June 2020.
