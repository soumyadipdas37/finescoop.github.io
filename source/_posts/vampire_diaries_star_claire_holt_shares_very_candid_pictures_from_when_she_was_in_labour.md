During the Q&A she also shared a number of images from the day, including one of her posing in her hospital gown and one featuring herself hugging her newborn daughter.

Claire revealed some personal details of the birth including that she had 'back labour' and received and epidural.

For those who don't know back labour is an intense pain that is felt in the lower back as a result of the baby's head pressing against the mother's spine and tailbone during birth.

'I don’t question every single decision that I make and know that all that matters is that she is loved, fed, and safe.'

She went on to add that her first child James, is the 'sweetest big brother' and he is 'adjusting well' to the new baby.
