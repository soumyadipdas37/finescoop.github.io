Joao Cancelo believes that Lionel Messi would have 'a great season' if he made the switch to Manchester City.

City is seen as a possible destination for Messi, who is eager to secure a move away from Barcelona.

Cancelo would relish the opportunity to play in the same team as Messi and says that playing with other great players at City would allow the Argentina star to thrive. 

Joao Cancelo has tipped Lionel Messi to fit straight in if he signs for Manchester City

'He's a great player, I won't say that he's not,' Cancelo told RTP.

'In a team like Manchester City, of course, also with great players on his side, he'd have a great season.'

Messi's future remains unresolved after he submitted a transfer request following a campaign in which Barcelona failed to win any silverware.

Cancelo believes that playing with other high quality players would bring the best out of Messi

Messi could be tempted by the possibility of reuniting with his former boss Pep Guardiola

The opportunity to reunite with manager Pep Guardiola, under whom he enjoyed much success at Barcelona, would surely be very appealing to Messi.

For all the quality players they have at their disposal, Champions League glory has continued to elude City, and the arrival of Messi could help them to finally win the prestigious trophy. 

Messi's father Jorge was in Barcelona on Wednesday for a meeting with the club regarding his son's future.

If a move to City did go ahead then the Premier League side would have to pay Messi's release clause of £630million.
