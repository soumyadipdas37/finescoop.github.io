Mac Davis, a country music legend as a singer and songwriter, has passed away at the age of 78, following heart surgery in Nashville.

The singer's family released a brief statement on Tuesday, revealing he fell 'critically ill' after the operation, though now his manager Jim Morey confirmed his death in a statement on his Facebook page.

'It's with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of Mac Davis. He was surrounded by the love of his life and wife of 38 years, Lise, and his sons Scott, Noah and Cody,' Morey began.

'Mac has been my client for over 40 years, and more importantly.. my best friend. He was a music legend but his most important work was that as a loving husband, father, grandfather and friend,' Morey added.

'I will miss laughing about our many adventures on the road and his insightful sense of humor. When there was a tough decision to be made he often told me “You decide.. I'm going to the golf course!"' Morey joked.

The singer-songwriter's longtime manager ended his statement with a lyric from his song I Believe In Music.

'I could just sit around making music all day long/As long as I'm making my music ain't gonna do nobody no harm/And who knows maybe I'll come up with a song,' adding that Davis did just that, 'time after time.'
