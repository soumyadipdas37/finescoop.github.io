She will soon be very busy presenting the upcoming series of Strictly Come Dancing.

And Claudia Winkleman let her hair down before the most manic time in her work calendar as she stepped out for dinner at Annabel's in Mayfair on Tuesday night.

The presenter, 48, looked stylish in a cream and black stripped jumper and black trousers as she left the swanky eatery.  

Night out: Claudia Winkleman looked stylish in a cosy jumper and knee-high boots as she stepped out for dinner at Annabel's on Tuesday night 

She finished off the autumnal outfit with a pair of brown heeled knee-high boots for the dinner with her mother Eve Pollard.  

Claudia opted for a very bronzed makeup look and highlighted her pretty features with her trademark dark eye liner.

Eve, 74, also looked chic in an all-black ensemble which she teamed with a cream trench coat.

Earlier this summer Claudia confessed she does not take her Strictly Come Dancing position for granted as she admitted she fears for her job. 

 In an interview with Daily Star Sunday, the host - who reportedly earns £450,000 a year - explained: 'If they'll have me, I'll keep doing it. But I assume I'll be fired any minute'. 

Claudia surprisingly revealed she has never tuned in to watch herself, insisting: 'I can't or I'd be sick, I can't imagine how irritating I am'.

The brunette beauty has worked on television for over 30 years and is undoubtedly an extremely talented presenter.

However, the mother-of-three has put a great deal of her success down to 'luck'. She said: 'I feel I have already had too long a run. I am incredibly lucky'.

Strictly Come Dancing will be back on screens on the BBC this autumn and will be presented by Claudia and Tess Daly. 

Home time: The presenter was out and about with her mother, with the pair seeming leaving in separate directions from the bar
