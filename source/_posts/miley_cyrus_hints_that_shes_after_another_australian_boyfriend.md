Miley Cyrus has hinted that she could be on the hunt for another Australian boyfriend in the near future.

Speaking to The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday, the 27-year-old admitted that she was keen to go 'shopping' for an Aussie bloke once the coronavirus restrictions are lifted.

When asked by host Kyle Sandilands if she was still single or not, Miley cheekily replied: 'I haven't been to Australia and been able to go shopping in a while, so next time I'm there...'.

Not understanding the reference, co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson responded: 'Oh, the shopping here is great, isn't it?'

Without skipping a beat, Kyle said: 'No darl, she's talking about d**k there, not actually shopping.'

Miley was famously married to Liam Hemsworth, but the couple split for good in 2019.

After their split, the songstress rebounded with Australian singer-songwriter Cody Simpson.

They dated for less than a year before calling it quits in early August.

Earlier this month, Miley opened up about her 'very public' divorce from Liam as she visited the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

The 27-year-old star said the split 'f*****g sucked' because of the 'villainizing' she experienced in the press after the breakup became public.

'What really sucked about it wasn't the fact that me and someone that I loved realized that we don't love each other the way that we used to anymore,' the Midnight Sky singer said. 

Though the said 'That’s okay, I can accept that. I can't accept the villainizing, and just all those stories.'

After the couple split last year, she had a very brief and public relationship with Kaitlynn Carter, and previously said she struggled with being portrayed as having cheated.
