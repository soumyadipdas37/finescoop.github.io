Train station and airport eatery operator SSP has unveiled a £1.3billion hit to revenues and confirmed 'considerable' job losses as lockdown and a slump in travel wiped out sales.

The Upper Crust owner, which also runs travel sites for chains such as M&S Simply Food, Starbucks and Burger King, said nearly two-thirds of its sites are still closed as demand remains low due to the coronavirus crisis. 

However, it reopened more sites since the easing of lockdown than it previously forecast. And said weekly sales are slowly improving thanks to a slight improvement in passenger demand, mostly across continental Europe. 

Despite a sharp fall in sales, investors reacted positively to the update, with SSP shares shooting up 14 per cent to 206p on Wednesday. 

SSP, which owns Upper Crust, said nearly two-thirds of its sites are still closed as demand remains low due to the coronavirus crisis

SSP, which in July unveiled plans to axe up to 5,000 UK jobs, has around 570 sites across 130 airport and railway stations in the UK and Ireland as well as outlets in 35 countries around the world.

Its airport outlets in the UK suffered the impact of ever-changing quarantine restrictions during the summer, SSP said, but performance did improve a bit, mostly thanks to holidaymakers who defied Covid fears and still went travelling. 

Its outlets at UK rail stations have seen a 'slow recovery' only recently - after a 'very weak' third quarter - thanks to a gradual return in commuter travel as people return to the office.  

SSP expects group sales to have slumped by 86 per cent in the second half to the end of September, which equates to a reduction in revenue of around £1.3billion compared to the same period last year.

A slight improvement in passenger demand has seen weekly sales declines narrow to around 76 per cent from 95 per cent in its third quarter, it said. 

This improvement has been driven by continental Europe, where weekly sales are 66 per cent lower than a year before, while in the UK, North America and Rest of the World, sales remain around 80 per cent to 85 per cent down. 

They have now re-opened just over a third, approximately 1,100, sites, which is  ahead of their June forecasts, when they expected to reopen just  SSP said. 

SSP, which also runs travel sites for the likes of Starbucks, said its airport outlets in the UK suffered the impact of ever-changing quarantine restrictions during the summer

It also said operating losses will be in the middle of its predicted £180million to £250million range. 

However, the latest restrictions announced by Boris Johnson yesterday, including instructions for office staff to work from home where they can, are likely to deal SSP another blow. 

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said it was now a case of 'two steps forward, one step back', at least for SSP's UK operations.

 'Sentiment is going to remain fragile towards getting on a train or going on a plane, and so SSP's outlets in rail stations and airports could have greatly reduced footfall,' he added. 

SSP cautioned that demand 'may well remain subdued' over the winter months.

Simon Smith, chief executive of SSP Group, said: 'We have seen some improvement in passenger demand since the start of the crisis and we have reopened units swiftly and profitably in response to this, with over one-third of our units now trading.

'Our model is flexible and we will continue to align unit openings with demand, meeting the needs of our customers whilst managing operating costs and cash flow tightly.

'In the medium term we expect to see the gradual return of passenger travel to more normalised levels.

'The actions we are taking to rebuild the business will enable us to emerge fitter and stronger.'
