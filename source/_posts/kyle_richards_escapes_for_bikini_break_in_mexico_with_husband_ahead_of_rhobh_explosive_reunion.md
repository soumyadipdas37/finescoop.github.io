They're set to air the virtual reunion of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills on Bravo tonight. 

But it seems Kyle Richards does not want to stick around at home to watch all the explosive drama play out. 

The 51-year-old reality star was pictured recently on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, the popular resort city on the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California peninsula, with her husband Mauricio Umansky, 50.   

Taking cover! Kyle Richards escapes for bikini break in Mexico with husband as the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reunion is set to air tonight on Bravo

In recent teasers of the show, Kyle has been seen sparring with the likes of Denise Richards and Garcelle Beauvais.

It's certainly been one of the most contentious seasons of RHOBH yet, so it's no wonder that Kyle wanted to escape their affluent zip code in order to take cover ahead of the reunion. 

While on vacation, Kyle looked to be in a state of bliss as she relaxed in a bikini and a kaftan, while her husband appeared to prioritizing his tan.

Last week, Kyle posted a snap of her bikini body while posing in a white two-piece at the hotel they were staying in, along with the caption: 'Felt cute, might delete later...' 

The star was also snapped checking her phone while she was on a trip, perhaps to see what the latest word on the street was about the upcoming reunion, which has been hitting headlines thanks to all the teasers. 

In the latest clip from show, Erika Janye, 49, got heated with the Wild Things actress, Denise as they once again talked about who said what at Kyle's outdoor barbecue.

Once again they discussed how Denise, 49, is just as potty mouthed as the rest of the cast, after she brought up the claim that her husband Aaron Phypers, 47, has a big penis. 

'You opened with, "He still has a big penis." That was, like, the first thing out of your mouth at your own barbecue with your own children sitting right there,' Erika began, adding: 'It comes out of your mouth first. You set the tone.' 

Teddi Mellencamp then put her two cents in, as she added: 'I think the part that's frustrating is your inability to say, 'You know what, yeah, I was kind of trying to make you look like a**holes and that's why I kept joking about it.'

However, Teddi, 39, was met with a chorus of disagreement, as Dorit Kemsley and Garcelle efended Denise, while Lisa Rinna just stayed silent. 

It remains to be seen exactly what Kyle will bring to the table with Denise. 

She previously apologized after she was filmed calling Denise a 'ragamuffin' and the pair have not been on good terms since Denise's pizza party. 

We have already seen Kyle confront Garcelle, 53, though, over a missing charity donation. 

Kyle accused the actress in a previous clip of failing to pay up, and stiffing her on a charity auction - something Garcelle denies.
