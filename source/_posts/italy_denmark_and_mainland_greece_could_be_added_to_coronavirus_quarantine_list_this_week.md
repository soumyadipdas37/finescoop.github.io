Denmark, Italy and mainland Greece are at risk of being added to the quarantine list this week following a rise in coronavirus infections. 

Figures show Denmark's cumulative number of cases over seven days – closely watched by Downing Street – is now at 28.7 infections per 100,000 people. 

This is well over the Government's quarantine threshold of 20 but less than United Kingdom's own rate of 31.5. 

Denmark is at risk of being added to the quarantine list this week following a rise in coronavirus infections.

Italy yesterday logged 16.5 cases per 100,000 residents and Greece 15.4. 

This puts all three nations in the amber zone – places at risk of being added to the red list of countries from which arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days. 

Insiders say ministers could hold off on imposing blanket restrictions on Italy but may insist on quarantining arrivals from Sicily, which has seen a spike in infections. 

Officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which monitors local outbreaks, will brief ministers later in the week.

The Department for Transport usually announces new additions to the quarantine list on Thursday evening, giving travellers until 4am on Saturday to return. 

The addition of Italy and mainland Greece would cause chaos for tens of thousands of Britons abroad and cap off a summer of misery for struggling airlines. 

The DfT has already imposed quarantine restrictions on seven Greek islands but has held off from taking action on the mainland. 

Greece is in the amber zone, meaning it is at risk of being added to the red list of countries from which arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days

Last week ministers re-added Portugal to the quarantine list, wrecking the travel plans of 35,000 British holidaymakers. 

Aviation bosses are desperate for ministers to end the 'quarantine roulette' and have backed the Daily Mail's campaign for a virus testing regime. 

A DfT spokesman said: 'We keep the data for all countries and territories under constant review and update our exemptions list with any changes on a regular basis.'
