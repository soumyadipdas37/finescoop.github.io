Love Island star Malin Andersson said she was 'relieved' after her ex-boyfriend was jailed for assaulting her following a campaign of physical and mental abuse.

Tom Kemp, 29, was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on Thursday after leaving Malin, 27, with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar' with 'mental health issues'.

Malin accused 'narcissistic man' Kemp of being abusive and unfaithful in Instagram posts last year.

Kemp was jailed for for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar' with 'mental health issues'

Malin branded her former love a 'narcissistic man' and claimed he had began an affair while their late daughter Consy was in hospital in January (pictured together in February 2019)

But Kemp, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time. 

Speaking after Kemp's conviction this week, a friend of Malin told The Mirror: 'Her nightmare is over at last.'

The star told a friend that she 'couldn't move for about two weeks' after the attack.

Malin and Kemp had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims Kemp had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.

Claim: On Wednesday Malin posted a lengthy Instagram post, captioned: 'The third and final lot, I am NOT a victim anymore'

In March they split again, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief. 

In June last year, Malin posted a lengthy Instagram post, captioned: 'The third and final lot, I am NOT a victim anymore.'

In response to Malin's Instagram claims last year, Kemp told MailOnline: 'She’s a liar, with mental health issues, she would do whatever it takes to be in the public eye. 

'I don’t care what people think about me. My family and friends know the truth.’

Malin then told MailOnline: 'Tom is clearly embarrassed about his behaviour and will say anything he can to defend himself. 

'I don’t want to get into a slanging match with him, I know the truth as do his family (who coincidentally are supporting me), but I share everything with my followers, the good, bad and ugly. 

'I have gone through some of the worst pain imaginable over the past couple of years and if me speaking out and showing my strength can help even one person in a similar situation and encourage them to leave an unhealthy relationship then it’s worth any negative things he has to say about me.

'I will not be mistreated any longer.'

Calling their romance 'toxic and unhealthy', she said 'it has been an ongoing battle to emotionally let go as dealing with the grief from both my mum and daughter I've had him as my comforter.'

Accusing Kemp of emotional and physical abuse she said: 'Including being spat at, hit, pushed, kicked, scratched, spoken down to, controlled, manipulated, cheated and so much more I experienced the worst pain yet to come last night.'

Malin then claimed she had received a phone call from a woman asking why the star had been texting her 'boyfriend.'

She wrote: 'After a calm and collected call with her we had finally came to the confirmation they have been speaking since January (when our daughter was in intensive care).'

'While I've been focusing on my mental health I've been receiving multiple emails, calls, texts from one extreme to the other (I'm a bad mum, my mum hates me I'm going to hell to the extreme of I love you I can't be without you etc. 

'This ladies is a fine example of a narcissistic man.

'I will NOT be another victim to domestic violence, I will not be beaten mentally or physically when I've fought through so much worse than this.

Adding that she was 'exhausted, heartbroken and confused' she urged her followers to 'listen to your gut and learn to love yourself.'

Malin then told MailOnline: 'Tom is clearly embarrassed about his behaviour and will say anything he can to defend himself. 

'I don’t want to get into a slanging match with him, I know the truth as do his family (who coincidentally are supporting me), but I share everything with my followers, the good, bad and ugly. 

'I have gone through some of the worst pain imaginable over the past couple of years and if me speaking out and showing my strength can help even one person in a similar situation and encourage them to leave an unhealthy relationship then it’s worth any negative things he has to say about me.

'I will not be mistreated any longer.'











Malin now wrestles with PTSD, after the abusive relationship left her mental health and self-esteem in tatters.

She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety.

'The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'

Kemp  was jailed on Thursday at Aylesbury Crown Court after admitting assault.
