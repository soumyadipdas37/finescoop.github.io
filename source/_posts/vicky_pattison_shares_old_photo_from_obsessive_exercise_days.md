What a difference: Vicky Pattison took to Instagram on Thursday to share a before and after picture of herself from when she used to 'obsessively' exercise in pursuit of the 'perfect' body

In the left hand side of the picture, Vicky sported a very trim physique, with a slender waist and legs, while she stared sadly at the camera.

In contrast, the right hand side Vicky had a significantly fuller figure , with the star flashing a broad smile at the camera while holding a dumbbell aloft.

Captioning the image, Vicky discussed how she wished she could speak to her younger self and tell her that she's not defined by how she looked or a 'number on a scale.'

She said: 'My heart breaks when I look at this. I wish I could give the girl on the left a hug. I wish I could tell her that things get better. That her self worth is not defined by a number on a scale.

'That being thin doesn’t mean you’re healthy. And having a thigh gap wont make you happy. 

'I wish I could tell her that women aren’t meant to be perfect- we’re all meant to be perfectly imperfect! Our beauty lies in our uniqueness! 

'We’re not all meant to look the same or even want to look the same- so stop striving to look like everyone you see in the magazines or Instagram & start embracing who YOU are!'

Delivering an empowering message to women, she continued: 'Women are meant to be curvy, or maybe slim, we’re meant to have big boobs or little ones! 

Reaching out: Captioning the image, Vicky discussed how she wished she could speak to her younger self and tell her that she's not defined by how she looked or a 'number on a scale'

'We’re meant to have lumps, bumps & cellulite too! We’re meant to laugh, to love, to enjoy a g&t or nail a cheeseburger every so often, we are meant to travel, fall in love, have families & make friends.. We are meant to do exactly what sets our soul on fire!

'We are meant to be whoever we want to be & do whatever makes us happy.'

She continued: 'We are not put on this earth to exercise obsessively, cry over a number on a scale, deprive ourselves & count how many blueberries we put on our porridge.

'Because quite frankly that is some boring & basic bulls**t.'



 

Inspiring: Delivering an empowering message to women, she continued: 'Women are meant to be curvy, or maybe slim, we’re meant to have big boobs or little ones!'

The TV personality went on to share how she's changed within herself and is no longer punishing herself for 'enjoying life'. 

She went on: 'I finally have balance in my life & a healthy relationship with exercise & food. I no longer punish myself for enjoying life & I’m not fighting to desperately change my shape.

'Instead I train because I love it. Because it makes me feel empowered, strong & capable. & because it is good for my mental health. 

'I eat right 80% of the time because I function better when I do. And I ate cheese and haribos the other 20% of the time because B***H THEY TASTE GOOD.'

Message: 'I wish I could tell her that women aren’t meant to be perfect- we’re all meant to be perfectly imperfect! Our beauty lies in our uniqueness!'

She concluded: 'I’m much happier being the girl on the right, & it’s written all over my face. 

'I Hope this brings some comfort to any ladies out there who may be struggling. Please be kind to yourselves & never forget, you’re beautiful exactly as you are!'

Earlier this year, Vicky told how she's learned to embrace her curves once more after getting back to a 'healthy size 12 to 14' after emerging from a dark period of her life which saw the death of her BFF Paul Burns and heartbreak at the hands of her cheating ex John Noble.

Amid the tough months she's endured, Vicky, who is loved up with Ercan Ramandan,  adopted a healthier lifestyle, which includes a life coach, therapy sessions and eating well once more.

Speaking to The Sun, Vicky slammed Kate Moss' famous mantra 'nothing tastes as good as skinny feels' as she insists 'the best feeling is being healthy'.

She said of Kate: 'She’s clearly never had a profiterole tower from Marks & Spencer or a Pepperoni Passion from Domino’s! The best feeling is being healthy and for some reason, I mistook what ‘health’ was. I thought it was a number on the scales or fitting into a size eight.' 

She went on to say that healthiness for her is no longer a number on a scale or 'fitting into a size eight.'

Instead, Vicky has learned to love the simple things in life including waking up ahead of her alarm or dancing in the street.'
