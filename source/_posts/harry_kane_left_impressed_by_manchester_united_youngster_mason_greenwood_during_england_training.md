Harry Kane has been left hugely impressed by Mason Greenwood in England training, hailing the international newbie as a 'real top finisher'.

The 18-year-old has been called up to the Three Lions senior squad for the first time after an exciting breakthrough season for Manchester United in the 2019-20 campaign. 

Greenwood could make his debut in England's Nations League double-header against Iceland and Denmark but faces competition from a host of other England names such as Kane, Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho and Danny Ings for the starting spot.

But according to England captain Kane, the teenager has done his starting chances no harm with a string of impressive displays in training so far.

‘Mason’s been great since the first training session we had. You can tell he’s full of confidence as a player, not afraid to shoot, not afraid to take players on and that’s exactly what we want,’ the Tottenham striker said at a press conference on Friday afternoon. 

‘He’s obviously done great for his club in the period after lockdown especially and it’s great to have him in the team.

‘As a goalscorer, people use the phrase “natural goalscorer” and I guess it’s just one of those things you work on a lot, being in the right place at the right time. 

‘Some of it is just instinct, balls dropping to you in the box and being able to finish it. 

Greenwood was in fine goalscoring form for the Red Devils last season, nailing down a regular starting spot in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side after lockdown and scoring 16 goals in all competitions.

The United academy product showed his capability to score goals of all kind and with both feet, something Kane thinks shows he is the complete package. 

The 18-year-old could be in line to make his senior international debut on Saturday

Kane has praised the teenager's ability to score goals of any kind during their training sessions

‘But I guess looking at him in the short time we’ve spent together, it’s all different types of finishes, whether it’s left foot or right foot, inside of the foot, powerful shots – I think that shows a real complete goalscorer, when you can score in any situation. 

‘Obviously it’s only been a short space of time but he definitely looks like a real top finisher and we look forward to having him in squads to come because he’s still very young.’ 

Greenwood is one of five uncapped players called up by manager Gareth Southgate along with Phil Foden, Kalvin Phillips, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Jack Grealish.

Southgate's men face Iceland on Saturday in Reykjavík before travelling to Copenhagen to face Denmark on Tuesday.
