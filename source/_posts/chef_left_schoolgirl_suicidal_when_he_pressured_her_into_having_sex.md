A mother of a 15-year-old girl who was left suicidal after an older chef pressured her into having sex has branded the £700 fine he was handed 'an insult'.

Jack Cross, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, admitted begging the victim for sex after meeting her on social media.

The 19-year-old preyed on the schoolgirl in 2017 and after persistently asking her to meet him, they had unprotected sex on two occasions.

Persistent Jack Cross pressurised the schoolgirl to have sex with him and admitted three charges of sexual activity with a child at Warwick Crown Court

Cross was caught after the girl's teacher heard rumours that she might be pregnant and questioned her.

He was arrested and on Tuesday (8 September) he admitted three charges of sexual activity with a child at Warwick Crown Court.

Outraged, the girl's stepfather stormed out of the court after Cross was spared jail and handed a 12-month community order.

He was also ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work and ordered to register as a sex offender for five years.

The judge offered to order Cross to pay the victim £700 compensation but her mother refused, branding it 'an insult'.

In a victim impact statement, the court heard the girl suffered flashbacks and felt suicidal.

She added that she 'would go to a train station and hope that a train came,' and 'sometimes sat down with a knife'.

Recorder Charles Falk said: 'I have read her victim impact statement, and it makes grim reading.'

The court heard sous chef left his victim suicidal after pressurising her into having sex with him 

He told Cross: 'You are now a young man of 19, two weeks off from your 20th birthday. These offences all took place in 2017.

'It is important for you to understand that the law draws a line on a young person's 16th birthday, and you fell on the wrong side of it.

'You were well aware of what you were doing, but you continued to go ahead.

'What you need to understand is that children have a right to be protected.

'That is why the law is there, and the law expects other people to accept those boundaries.

'You were still a young person yourself, and not yet an adult in the eyes of the law.

'But as the older participant you should have shown responsibility, but you sought to persuade and cajole and inveigle her to take part in sexual intercourse.'

Warwick Crown Court heard how Cross had sex with the girl at her home while her mother was out - once in her bedroom and a second time in the living room

Recorder Falk asked the girl's mother whether she would accept £700 compensation or whether it would be 'adding insult to injury'.

The mother replied: 'The second one.'

Instead, Cross was ordered to pay £700 court costs.

Peter Cooper, prosecutor, said that in 2017 Cross and the girl had arranged to meet after chatting on social media..

Cross then began continually asking her for sex, despite knowing she was only 15, 'and in the end she agreed'.

The court heard Cross had sex with the girl at her home while her mother was out - once in her bedroom and another time in the living room.

When he was arrested Cross, who accepted he knew she was only 15, claimed that on the first occasion the girl had instigated sex.

Amy Jackson, defending, said: 'He accepts he had come to realise before the sexual activity occurred that she was under 16. 

The court heard Cross and his family had suffered harassment and threats and had left the area and he was now working as a sous chef.
