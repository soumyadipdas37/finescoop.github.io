Lizzo has been known to serve a stunning look on more than one occasion.

But it turns out the three-time Grammy winner can manage just fine with out her hair and makeup crew. 

She basked in her beauty Saturday, as she took to her Instagram Story with a video showing off her glam look, after proudly doing her own makeup.

The 32-year-old said to her 9.1million Instagram followers: 'I did my own makeup today, and... Mam. Ooh. I don't even have my lip on yet... Wow.'

She put her glowing beat mug on display, puckering her lips and showing off some gold earrings with a matching necklace.

Lizzo has long been a champion of self-love, writing last April in an essay for NBC News: 'I understand how difficult it is to "just love yourself" in a society in which the media quite literally tells us that we don't have enough money to love ourselves. 

'It tells you that you should get money to buy this so you can look like that and be perfect. And so a lot of people ask me how I do it, and I tell them that I don't take self-acceptance for granted or lightly, because I know it's difficult.'

She followed it up with a video of her putting a wine glass up to a cardboard cutout of the birthday girl.

Lizzo said in her best Bey voice: 'Thank you, Lizzo. I really appreciate it. And here's to many, many more birthdays. H-town, baby. Third Ward!'
