MasterChef judge Melissa Leong has revealed the restaurant she goes to for her favourite scrambled eggs in Australia.

The food critic, from Melbourne, said she can't get enough of renowned chef Bill Granger's famed scrambled eggs from Bills in Sydney.

'There's much luxury to be experienced in the care that goes into those cloudlike curds and that silky texture,' Melissa wrote in a column for Escape.

Served with sourdough toast, the $16.50 classic breakfast menu item has become a  star attraction of the restaurants, with dozens of diners describing the dish as the 'best scrambled eggs' in the country.

Earlier this year, the restaurant delighted diners everywhere after the chef revealed his secret to cooking scrambled eggs to perfection.

'The secret to our super creamy scrambled eggs? Move quick on the pan - and don't hold out on the cultured butter,' the owner of Bills wrote on Instagram.

Many regular customers revealed it's their go-to dish when dining at Bills, which has three restaurants in Darlinghurst, Surry Hills and Bondi Beach.

'Always a favourite of mine,' one diner wrote, while another added: 'You guys have the best scrambled eggs ever. No one else compares.'

The food critic said it's the Sydney restaurant she goes to for her favourite scrambled eggs 

Melissa's favourite dish comes just months after her MasterChef co-host Andy Allen shared his simple cooking tricks to make the perfect 'restaurant-quality' scrambled eggs in just 10 seconds.

The co-owner of Three Blue Ducks said one of the most common questions he gets asked at his restaurant is 'how do you make your scrambled eggs for breakfast?'

The celebrity chef said all you need are eggs, salt and oil.   

'We call them 'the 10 second eggs',' Andy said in a 'how-to' MasterChef video.

To make one serving of fluffy scrambled eggs, he whisked two eggs in a bowl until they have a 'smooth' consistency and then seasoned with a pinch of salt.

'Here's the trick, we want a nice hot pan,' Andy explained.

Over high heat, Andy then poured the mixture into the pan and as the curds started to form, he quickly used a silicone spatula to move the eggs around 

He opted for grape seed oil because it's better suited for cooking eggs at a higher temperature.

'I'm using grape seed oil, which has got a high smoke point. You can also use rice bran or vegetable oil,' Andy said.

'We want to stay away from olive oil for this [dish] because we put the eggs in just before our oil starts to smoke.'

Over high heat, Andy then poured the mixture into the pan and as the curds started to form, he quickly used a silicone spatula to move the eggs around.

'Have your spatula ready because this only takes 10 seconds,' he said.

'Eggs in to a nice hot pan... you can see that they're just starting to cook around the outside, and in one kind of big smooth motion, we're just moving the eggs.'

After 10 seconds, Andy said you should see the eggs are 'just set'.

'We take them out [of the pan],' he said.

The chef said you can serve the scrambled eggs over toasted sourdough.

'There it is, 10 second eggs, no excuses. All you'll need is a hot pan, two eggs and 10 seconds, everyone can do that,' he added.
