Boat passengers have reportedly suffered injuries on the world's last ocean-going paddle steamer after it crashed into a pier on the Isle of Arran this afternoon.

The Waverley paddle steamer crashed near the the ferry terminal in Brodick, Scotland, at around 5.15pm.

A coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Prestwick has been sent to the scene, along with Arran coastguard rescue team. 

Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Scottish Ambulance Service and Police Scotland are also attending.

The paddle steamer was due to arrive in Brodick at 5pm after leaving Greenock this morning.

Boat passengers have reportedly suffered injuries on the Waverley paddle steamer (pictured departing from Glasgow last month) after it crashed near the the ferry terminal in Brodick, Isle of Arran, at around 5.15pm

An ambulance, fire engine and helicopter are at the scene and the number of passengers aboard is not yet known.

Gavin Saxby posted a photo showing the vessel's bow badly damaged on social media.

He wrote: 'Just on PS Waverley as they crashed it into the pier at Brodick, what a mess on board, lots of injuries, hope everyone recovers.'

Karren Mulligan said: 'Wee trip on the Waverley today which was wonderful as I've waited 2 years to do it. Then it crashed.

'Thankfully I've managed to get away with a few bumps and bruises but so many people got much worse.'

Anne Cochrane, from Bishopbriggs near Glasgow, left the Waverley when it docked in Brodick earlier today and was waiting to board when the boat crashed. 

She told the BBC: 'It just crashed into the pier when it was coming back from the Holy Isle. We're just stuck in the departure terminal. We've had no information.'

Alistair Wylie from Gourock, told InverclydeNow: 'I heard the thud of the boat hitting the concrete pier. 

'A Coastguard helicopter is landing now and the Coastguard, ambulance, police and fire brigade are all here.'

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'HM Coastguard received a VHF broadcast at 5.28pm today from a paddle steamer reporting a collision with Brodick Pier on the Isle of Arran. 

'A coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Prestwick has been sent, along with Arran coastguard rescue team.

Police Scotland said: 'Police Scotland is currently in attendance at Brodick Ferry Terminal after an incident involving a steam boat, which happened at 5.15pm.' 

The Waverley returned to the sea on August 22 for the first time in almost two years following major repairs.

An appeal for funding was launched last year after it was announced the paddle steamer would not sail in 2019.

More than £2.3m was raised in seven months by more than 8000 members of the public and £1m from the Scottish Government.

Waverley's 2020 sailing season was severely reduced due to Covid-19 from over five months to just a few weeks.

Passenger capacity was reduced to under 30 per cent resulting in an immediate funding crisis to meet the cost of the coming winter period.

The paddle steamer was built by A & J Inglis of Glasgow and first launched in October 1946.

In June 2009, it struck the breakwater at Dunoon with 700 passengers on board, 12 of whom suffered minor injuries.
