She's left her fans and admirers guessing as to whether she is indeed expecting her third child.

And model April Love Geary was again seen in a lovely pink ensemble in Malibu, California on Saturday morning, making an early grocery run so as to avoid the large weekend crowds.

The 25-year-old wife of Robin Thicke wore an empire waist dress in a soft-looking material that only amplified rumors that she looks pregnant.

The 5ft11in beauty strode along behind her shopping cart with her blondish hair down, covering up with a pink floral face mask and thick sunglasses. 

Geary's dress featured a wrapped bust and short sleeves, and the billowing skirt ended just below her knees. 

The garment definitely fanned out, giving the impression of a growing baby bump underneath.

To complete the look, April wore tan sandal flats.

Robin and April, who have been wed since 2014, already share two young children – daughters Mia Love, two, and Lola Alain, one. 

Lola's middle name is for her late grandfather, Robin's dad Alan Thicke of Growing Pains fame.

Alan died at the age of 69 in 2016. 

Robin, 43, also has a 10-year-old son named Julian, whom he shares with his ex-wife, actress Paula Patton. 

On Thursday, April chose a different, tighter pink ensemble that appeared to show signs of a baby bump.

And while she has yet to confirm the pregnancy speculation, she did take to social media last month to brush off the internet trolls who have criticized her for her figure after she had two children.

'Just letting you know that I'm not really bothered by all your guys' comments when you say I was "so much more attractive" when I was skinnier,' she said.

'Because before having babies, I didn't have this fat a** and I am forever grateful for this baby weight,' April added cheekily.
