The Government are expected to provide an update on the return of fans to stadiums this week, with several Football League clubs planning to press ahead with pilot events this weekend.

The crowds at all the test events will be limited to 1,000 spectators, in line with the guidance the Government issued last week.

But there is increasing optimism that fans will be permitted to attend games in larger numbers next month.

There is increasing optimism that fans will be allowed back into stadiums soon 

The Government's willingness to sanction several test events this weekend has been interpreted as a positive sign.

An announcement of the matches involved is likely to come on Wednesday.

The EFL and Premier League are lobbying Government to sanction the return of fans, as are the RFU, who have already put tickets on sale for England's rugby international against the Barbarians next month.

Clubs in the Football League are waiting to hear an update from the government
