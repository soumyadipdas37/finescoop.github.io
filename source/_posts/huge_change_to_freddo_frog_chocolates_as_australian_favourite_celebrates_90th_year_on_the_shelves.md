One of Australia's favourite chocolate treats has undergone a huge makeover as it celebrates its 90th year on supermarket shelves.

Cadbury announced on Wednesday Freddo Frog's will now be hollow and filled with animal-shaped candies instead of the traditional solid bar. 

The new 25g chocolates will also come in recyclable foil packaging with new colourful designs.

Each year the design will change to represent different parts of the world, with Cadbury hoping it will create a collecting craze.

The first designs will showcase swimsuits, snorkels and spacesuits with dolphin and seahorse shaped candies inside.  

Marketing Manager for Cadbury, Kate Watson, said it was an exciting new chapter for the brand.

'For 90 years, Freddo has given generations of Australians shared moments of wonder and joy,' she said.

'During what's been a challenging time for us all, Freddo 3D Adventure encourages us to be free-spirited and adventurous, urging us to embrace our curiosity and appreciate the world around us.'

The new look Freddo's have already hit Australian stores and are selling for $2.50. 

Freddo Frog was first introduced by the MacRobertson's chocolate company in 1930 before becoming a Cadbury product in 1967.
