Jade Goody's eldest son Bobby Brazier has revealed that he hopes his late mother is 'looking down on me and smiling' after he landed his first fashion magazine cover. 

The model, 17, was five years old when his mother died from cervical cancer aged 27,  and has since forged a career as a model, starring on the cover of Man About Town magazine this week.

The teenager, who made his runway debut at Milan Fashion Week in January, bares a striking resemblance to his late mum.

Bobby, who lives with his father and TV presenter Jeff Brazier, 41, told The Sun how he believes his mum 'would love' him 'trying my best to make something of my life'.  

He said: 'Like every boy, you want to think your mum would be proud of you.

'I hope she's looking down on me and smiling, probably laughing, thinking, "Look at Bobby lying in a field in his designer gear".' 

The fashion star, who also lives with his younger brother Freddie, 16, recently told how he pays £200 a month to stay at the Essex family home.

However Bobby revealed how he wants to 'make a name' for himself first before agreeing to reality TV shows. 

The model revealed how he would 'definitely' agree to I'm a Celebrity in the future but his 'dream job' would be as a judge on Britain's Got Talent. 

Earlier this year Bobby looked every part the professional as he strutted down the catwalk in items from the fashion house's Fall/Winter 2020 collection.  

Speaking to MailOnline about his experiences in the modelling world, Bobby said: 'Modelling has been great fun, I'm loving it: you get a chance to do something exciting.  

'I'm modelling alongside my apprenticeship; I'm not sure if it will be full time yet, we will have to see how it goes!'

Jade passed away on Mother's Day, 10 years ago, but was able to speak with Bobby and Freddie, who were just five and four years old at the time, before her death. 

After her cervical cancer diagnosis, Jade's cancer spread to her bowel, liver and groin and she died on Mother's Day in March 2009. 

Speaking to Barrow-in-Furness based paper The Mail, Jeff said the last 10 years had been 'tremendously difficult - that's the only way I can really put it. There's been ups and downs, but we've come through it together.'

The star - who wasn't in a relationship with Jade at the time of her passing - went on that to say that his sons were 'coming of age' and 'have grown into wonderful young men. I'm hugely proud of them.'
