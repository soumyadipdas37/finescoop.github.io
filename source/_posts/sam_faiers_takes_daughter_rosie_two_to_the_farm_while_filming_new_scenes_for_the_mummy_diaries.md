Sam's day with Rosie came after she took eldest child, son Paul, four, to his first day of school, with the star admitting she 'balled her eyes out'.

Their day out comes after the former TOWIE star told how she 'bawled my eyes out' as she took her four-year-old son Paul to his first day of school on Thursday.

Sam took to Instagram to share a photo of her eldest beaming as he posed in his smart uniform holding a book-bag.

Sam told her followers it was a 'huge milestone' in parenthood, after she and Paul Knightley had previously argued over whether Paul Jr should be homeschooled. 

Sam captioned the post: 'When your children are babies in your arms, you think far into the future about school and how it's years away.. well that day was today for us. I'm beyond proud of you my darling. 

'Paul's first day at school honestly it was so emotional for those who aren't there yet, brace yourself he said to me when we was in the car "I love you Mummy, are you going to cry happy tears?".

Talking about Paul Jr's reaction to starting school, Sam sweetly revealed: 'He came with us on the second viewing, he spent a few hours there and loved it. It was really cute, as we left the school, he said: "Oh I've really loved it there, can I go back tomorrow?"
