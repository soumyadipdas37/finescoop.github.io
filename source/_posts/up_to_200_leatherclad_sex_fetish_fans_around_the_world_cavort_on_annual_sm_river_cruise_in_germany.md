S&M fans have continued their tradition of partying on a boat in Germany this year, despite the coronavirus pandemic.  

Typically, 600 passengers would board the 'Torture Ship', but no more than 250 people were allowed to take part this year amid the worldwide Covid-19 outbreak.

Slightly fewer than that number arrived, with 200 or so buying the 67 Euro tickets to take part in the tour between Konstanz and Friedrichshafen, Bild reports.

Typically, the cruise will bring thousands of onlookers to ports in Friedrichshafen and Constance, but this year the piers were closed in advance to discourage crowds from gathering, due to the virus

A spokesman for Bodensee-Schiffsbetriebe (BSB), whose ship the party took place on, said the organiser had made every effort to comply with Germany's coronavirus restrictions

Organiser Thomas Siegmund today said: 'The mood was good, a wild party wasn't planned anyway.'

A spokesman for Bodensee-Schiffsbetriebe (BSB), whose ship the party took place on, said the organiser had made every effort to comply with Germany's coronavirus restrictions.

Mr Siegmund, who said he deliberately chose to attend the event in spite of the pandemic, added: 'It's not profitable. But it's about giving people a perspective out of the dilemma.'
