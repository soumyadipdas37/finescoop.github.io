Samantha Armytage and her beau Richard Lavender announced their engagement in June.

And, on Friday, her Sunrise co-star Edwina Bartholomew accidentally let slip a detail about the TV presenter's upcoming nuptials in a birthday tribute for her pal. 

Posting to Instagram, the 37-year-old revealed that Sam, 44, plans to say 'I do' in a 'paddock'.

'Happy birthday  @sam_armytage Next time we are drunk in a paddock will be on your big day,' she captioned the post.   

While Edwina didn't specify exactly where Sam plans on tying the knot, it is likely that she was referring to one of the rural properties owned by Sam and Richard in the Southern Highlands of NSW. 

Accompanying the post was a throwback picture from Edwina's 2018 wedding at her country Property in Capertee Valley, NSW.

Sam looked chic in a strapless black dress with a matching jacket and gold statement earrings.  

Meanwhile, Edwina was glowing in the vintage wedding gown that belonged to her grandma.

Sam announced her engagement to horse breeder Richard on Sunday, June 21. 

She shared two photos to Instagram of herself in the arms of her fiancé, with a diamond ring on her wedding finger. 

When she returned to Sunrise the following Tuesday, she told co-host David 'Kochie' Koch that Richard had proposed on the spur of the moment in the paddock of his country property.
