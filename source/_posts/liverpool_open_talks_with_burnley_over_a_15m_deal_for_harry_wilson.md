Liverpool have reportedly opened up talks with Burnley over a £15million deal for forward Harry Wilson.

The Wales international spent last season on loan at Bournemouth and Liverpool are keen to offload the 23-year-old as he does not feature in Jurgen Klopp's plans.

Wilson was one of few bright sparks for Bournemouth last season as they were relegated from the Premier League but has fallen further down the pecking order at Liverpool following the £41million arrival of Diogo Jota from Wolves.

Sky Sports claim the two clubs have opened up negotiations with Liverpool seeking a bid in the region of £15m.

Wilson had also impressed during a loan spell under Frank Lampard at Derby in the Championship two seasons ago where he scored 18 times in 50 matches.

Sean Dyche is also said to be on the verge of completing a deal for Brighton midfielder Dale Stephens.

According to Sky, Stephens is in London finalising paperwork and completing a medical ahead of Burnley's EFL clash at Millwall this evening.  

The initial fee for Stephens is believed to be £1m but could potentially rise to £2.5m. 

The double signing of Stephens and Wilson would represent the first piece of major business Burnley have done all summer with Will Norris currently the only arrival from Wolves.
