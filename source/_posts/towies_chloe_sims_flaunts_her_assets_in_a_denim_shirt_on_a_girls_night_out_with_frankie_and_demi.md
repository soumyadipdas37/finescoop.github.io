She's been busy filming for the new series of TOWIE and reconnecting with her pal Pete Wicks after their falling out back in January.

And Chloe Sims appeared to be in great spirits as she enjoyed some quality time with her sisters Frankie and Demi on a girls night out in London on Saturday. 

The reality TV star, 37, looked sensational as she flaunted her eye-popping cleavage in a denim shirt which she left unbuttoned at the front.

Chloe showed off her fashion credentials in a pair of flared jeans that highlighted her toned figure and were covered in a trendy star print.

Not one to forget her accessories, Chloe continued with the wild-west theme by toting a white leather fringed bag and adding a selection of stylish bracelets.

The blonde beauty wore her long locks down and perfectly curled, letting them cascade over her shoulders as she strutted into the venue.

Chloe was joined on the night out to Bagatelle by her two stylish younger sisters Frankie, 25, and Demi, 23.

The youngest Sims beauty put on a leggy display in a black mini skirt and matching leather jacket.

Demi also flashed her taut abs by donning a white crop top with writing across the front before finishing up her fashionable ensemble with a pair of clear heels.

Meanwhile, Frankie followed Chloe's lead in a pair of denim trousers but added her own twist by opting for a cargo pant style.

She displayed her ample assets in a plunging white top before covering up her shoulders by draping a tan blazer jacket over them.

Frankie wore her long blonde locks down and poker straight and was seen laughing as she arrived at the venue with her two sisters.

It comes after Chloe finally talked to her former pal Pete Wicks after eight months of not speaking.  

In an exclusive preview shared with MailOnline, the reality stars are seen talking about their feud while standing beside some water. 

However things soon get a little heated as Chloe airs her grievances and explains to Pete why she's been unhappy with their friendship.

Pete kick starts the awkward conversation by asking if there's 'anything' Chloe would like to say. 

She then replies: 'Not really, I don't wanna be rude in front of Peggy [Pete's dog], but you were a bit of an a***hole. 

'Towards the end of our friendship I felt like you started dismissing my feelings and … are you going to look at me or are you going to look at the bush? 

'I feel like you were dismissing how I felt a lot, I've confided in you, I've told you everything and told you all my secrets... and I know I'm a lot. 

'I know I can be clingy and I can be jealous that is who I am, so if you don't like those things then we can't be friends cause I'm not going to change, I am who I am.' 

Posers: The sisters sizzled as they worked all their best angles outside Bagatelle in London

Pete then tried to interject, telling Chloe to 'hold on, hold on', but to no avail as she continued to explain how she was feeling.

She continued: 'No, I'm getting to my point. Obviously when the pandemic happened I just thought 'omg I need Pete, I need to talk to Pete''

Pete then asked his former close pal, 'so why didn't ya?' with Chloe replying that she 'didn't know if you would be there even if I did reach out'.

During the interaction Pete appears to be concentrating hard on what Chloe has to say about what went wrong between them.

Despite finally chatting about what the problem is, the pair did not reveal why they had fallen out in the first place in the clip.
