She was axed from this year's Farmer Wants A Wife reboot during the first episode. 

But despite being rejected by farmer Alex Taylor, the future looks bright for model Tahlia Rubio.

The 23-year-old has launched her own fashion line, third THE LABEL.

According to the brand's Instagram page, the collection that's yet to be unveiled includes women's and men's loungewear and streetwear.

It's unknown when the official launch day will be, simply teased as 'coming soon'. 

After her episode aired in July, Tahlia told Daily Mail Australia that she has remained in contact with Alex, 29.

'Alex and I are just mates, we chat here and there,' she said.   



Alex, who is a sheep and cattle farmer from Cunnamulla in South West Queensland, was forced to send four ladies home on the premiere - which was filmed many months ago.

'We chat here and there, but it's mainly just to check in to see how we are feeling about the show and life in general,' Tahlia said of her friendship with Alex at the time.

Tahlia also claimed she's since created a close bond with the 'incredible women' she was on the show with, and considers some of them 'lifelong friends'.  

'In a weird way we (the cast) are all like one big family. We went into this journey to find love together so it's something unique that we all share,' she said. 

Despite not finding love on the series, Tahlia said she felt 'blessed' to have been a part of the reboot.
