Blondes may have more fun, but Bebe Rexha looked ready for plenty of fun as a redhead on Wednesday.

The 31-year-old Meant To Be singer shared her hair transformation with her 10.3 million Instagram followers as she dyed it a candy-colored shade of red.

Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the songwriter turned it into a DIY job at her home.

Bebe showed off her curvaceous figure in a a white tank top that was tied off at the bottom to highlight her midriff, and she also wore a set of black sweatpants.

Before her dye job, she sported platinum blonde hair with her darker roots popping out. 

After putting gloves on, she squirted a generous dollop of dye on her her hands and proceeded to rub it into her hair.

Once she had a scarlet mass of hair, she washed it off before dramatically flipping her hair back to reveal the final look.

Bebe posed with a sultry look as her scarlet locks dripped on her top.

She seemed to have left her roots intact to create a stylish ombré look.

'New me [fire emoji] watcha think?' she captioned the clip.

The songstress soundtracked her video to Like That by Doja Cat, with whom she recently collaborated on the song Baby I'm Jealous.

The two women were seen filming the song's video on September 23, and though Bebe's head was covered with a towel, a bit of red hair peaked out, suggesting the dye video may have been old and done for the music video.

On Monday, Bebe was seen again while filming an ad, and this time she sported platinum blonde locks again

However, her roots were also dyed, so she may have gone back to being a blonde after a short detour as a redhead.

The city of Los Angeles has allowed projects to resume filming as long as precautions are taken to keep up social distancing. Frequent coronavirus testing and hand-washing stations are also required to decrease the likelihood of infection.

Prior to revealing her hair color change, Bebe sowed off her long blonde tresses in a stunning white lace bodysuit that left little to the imagination.

The I'm A Mess singer paired the look with a stylish white fedora and showed off her wavy locks.

'I felt like this one deserved a grid post,' she captioned it.

A follow-up posted to her Instagram stories showed Bebe with her new filmmaker boyfriend Keyan Safyari.

The duo were first linked after they were spotted leaving celebrity hotspot Delilah back in March.
