New York City firefighters chased down a man who randomly punched a woman in the face on a sidewalk as he rode past her on his bicycle just a few feet away from a fire station, according to newly surfaced video.

The incident, which was caught on surveillance footage, took place at around 5pm in front of the FDNY’s 214/Ladder 111 fire station on August 26.

A 60-year-old woman in a blue shirt was walking down Hancock Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn when a man approached while riding a bicycle from the opposite direction.

The man swerves onto the sidewalk and lands a punch to the woman’s face, knocking her backwards to the pavement.

The incident took place in front of a fire station. Seconds after the assault, four firefighters are seen giving chase

Seconds later, four firefighters emerge from the fire station and are seen giving chase.

The man on the bike turns left at the corner of Hancock and Lewis Avenue before he is caught by the four men.

The firefighters wrestle him to the ground and pin him down until police arrive. He was then taken into custody.

As firefighters surrounded the suspect, he allegedly punched a 29-year-old fireman in the eye, causing bruising and swelling. 

The woman suffered a cut mouth, but police said she declined medical attention at the scene, according to WCBS-TV.

The New York Police Department identified the suspect as Daniel Biggs, 53.

According to the NYPD, Biggs has 18 prior arrests, including for assault and robbery.

On August 2, Biggs slashed a man in the face.

According to police, Biggs and the victim were strangers. Investigators are trying to determine a motive for the attack. 

New York City has been reeling from a crime wave this year that has forced the police department to increase weekend patrols citywide.

Officials have linked the rise in crime to the pandemic, a surge in unemployment, civil unrest, and protests.

There was a 162 per cent increase in the number of shooting victims and a 166 per cent increase in the number of shooting incidents during the four-week period that ended on August 23 compared to the same period last year, police data shows.

During the four-week period ending on August 23, the city recorded 48 homicides - a 50 per cent increase from the 32 homicides that were recorded during the same period last year.

Between January 1 and August 23, the city recorded 280 homicides - a 35 per cent increase from 208 homicides that were recorded during the same period of 2019.

In July, murders were up 58.8 percent when compared to the same month last year. Shootings were up a staggering 177 per cent.

In Manhattan's Upper West Side residents have complained and threatened to sue the Mayor after homeless people were moved into three luxury hotels in the area to protect them from COVID-19.

Residents of the upscale neighborhood complain that the move-in of the vagrants has brought with it increased crime, random violence, drugs, public urination and open prostitution.

At the moment more than 13,000 homeless people are being housed in 139 hotels across the Big Apple, including three luxury hotels – The Belleclaire, The Lucerne and The Belnord – on the Upper West Side.

The uptick in crime comes as protests have unfolded across the country denouncing police brutality and seeking to defund police departments.

New York City announced it will slash the police budget by $1billion in July. The department budget was almost $6billion for the 2020 fiscal year.
