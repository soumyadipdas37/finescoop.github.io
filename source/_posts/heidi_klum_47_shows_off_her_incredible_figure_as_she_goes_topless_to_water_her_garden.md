She's never shy showing off her model looks in sexy social media posts. 

And Heidi Klum flaunted her incredible figure yet again as she posed topless to water her garden on Sunday.

The German supermodel, 47, made sure all eyes were on her pert posterior in the tiny snake skin bikini briefs.

Wow! Heidi Klum, 47, showed off her incredible figure as she went topless to water her garden in a sizzling snap on Sunday

The blonde beauty showed off her muscly back and toned thighs for the Instagram snap where she indulged in a spot of gardening.  

She wore her slicked back tresses over her shoulder as she stared seductively into the camera. 

In another racy snap shared to her Instagram Story, Heidi put on a busty display in a lacy black bra.

The mother-of-four looked sensational in the black and white snap as she showed off her trademark fringe and beamed into the camera.

The star also shared a slew of loved-up snaps with her husband Tom Kaulitz on Sunday as they larked around in sweet selfies.  

The former Victoria's Secret model has two sons, Henry, 14, and Johan, 13, as well as a daughter Lou, 10, with ex-husband, singer Seal, 56.

She also has a daughter, Leni, 16, with ex-partner Flavio Briatore. She dated art dealer Vito Schnabel, 33, then moved on to Tom.

Her sultry snaps come after she filed a request for an emergency court hearing seeking to force her ex-husband Seal to allow her to take their children to Germany with her in October. 

While he expressed concerns about the kids traveling to Europe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Seal has now agreed to allow Klum to take them with her, People reported last week.

Settled: The model reached an agreement with ex-husband Seal allowing her to take their kids with her to Germany for Next Top Model filming in October after she requested an emergency court hearing to force him to permit it

In return, Seal will get expanded visitation with the children both before they leave and upon their return, according to the publication, as well as being able to see them while they are in Germany if he so wishes. 

Klum is going to Germany to film a new season of the country's Next Top Model reality show.

In her previous court filing, she explained that the series is normally filmed in the USA but the German cast and crew are not permitted currently to enter America due to the pandemic. 

Klum and Seal, 57, married in 2005 and finalized their divorce in 2014

Klum married German guitarist Tom Kaulitz, 30, in February 2014. 

In legal documents obtained by TheBlast.com on August 20, the German model and TV personality explained that the children did not want to be parted from her for the three-and-a-half months she's contracted to be in Germany but that Seal had not signed off on the trip.

Instead, she stated, he preferred the children to remain in Los Angeles, where he also resides.   

The new agreement he has reached with Klum states that should the coronavirus crisis escalate to the point where the US decides to shut down its borders, Klum must 'immediately make arrangements in an effort to return home with the children before the borders close.'
