 Moments after NFL star Patrick Mahomes received his hard earned Super Bowl ring, he gave an even more meaningful ring to his longtime girlfriend.

The 24-year-old Kansas City Chiefs quarterback popped the question to Brittany Matthews shortly after he and his teammates received their bling during a ceremony at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City on Tuesday night.

Patrick took to his Instagram to share a photo of his 25-year-old fiancee's engagement ring which featured a massive diamond.

The star quarterback surprised Brittany at the stadium with an intricate floral arrangement and a bright sign which read 'will you marry me.'

No word in the price of the ring but Patrick can definitely afford it as back in July he signed the biggest contract in NFL history which was $503million over 10 years.

The two made wave shortly after his Super Bowl victory as they put on a PDA-filled display including Brittany straddling Patrick on the Hard Rock Stadium field in Miami back in February.

What made the heartfelt embrace even more special: the couple are high school sweethearts who have been dating since the 10th grade.

Moments after the final ticks of the game clock and the confetti fell from the rafters, Mahomes picked up his ladylove for a full-body embrace, complete with her legs wrapped firmly around 6ft 3in frame.

The two stared into each other's eyes, said a few brief words, and then shared a number of smooches.

Matthews and Mahomes are actually high school sweethearts, who first started dating when he was sophomores and she was a junior in Whitehouse, Texas. 

Their courtship even included going to the prom together.  

After graduating high school in 2013, Matthews went on to play soccer at nearby University of Texas at Tyler, while Mahomes, who graduated in 2014, went on to play at Texas Tech University, some 400 plus miles away.

She ended up moving to Kansas City after Mahomes was drafted by the Chiefs with the 10th pick in the NFL draft in 2017.
