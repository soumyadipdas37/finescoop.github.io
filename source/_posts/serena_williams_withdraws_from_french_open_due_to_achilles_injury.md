Serena Williams has withdrawn from the French Open before her second round clash, due to an achilles injury. 

Williams said in an emotional press conference on Wednesday: 'I really wanted to give an effort here. It's my achilles which didn't have enough time to properly heal after the US Open... 

'I was able to get it somewhat better but just looking long term in this apportionment will I be able to get through enough matches? For me, I don't think I could. (I'm) struggling to walk so that's a tell-tale sign that I should try to recover.'
