Lorraine viewers were left stunned by Emmerdale actress Fiona Wade's uncanny resemblance to Meghan Markle on today's show. 

The actress, 41, from London, is a dead ringer for the royal and was compared to the Duchess of Sussex, 39, by host Lorraine Kelly after appearing donning a blouse similar to the blue and white striped Ralph Lauren shirt to Wimbledon in 2018. 

The soap star insisted she was 'very flattered' by the hosts comments, and admitted she's been compared to Meghan. 

Viewers were quick to comment on the resemblance, with one saying Fiona is the Duchess' 'double', while another admitted she thought it was Meghan being interviewed when she turned on her TV.

'I was looking at you this morning, said Lorraine, 'I know people think you look like Meghan Markle, you really do this morning.

'I don't know whether it's the hair and the lovely shirt the way she does it, it's quite remarkable.

She added: 'If you're being compared to someone it's not bad being compared to Meghan Markle she's gorgeous.' 

A delighted Fiona went on: 'I've been told I look like her before, I'm very flattered she's absolutely gorgeous. So i'm not sure whether we do look like each other, but i'm very flattered so thank you.'
