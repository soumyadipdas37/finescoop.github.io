Tziporah Malkah was seen entering Sydney's Downing Centre court complex on Thursday.

The 45-year-old, formerly known as Kate Fischer, was listed for mention in a matter involving police, which was adjourned to the same court next week.

The daughter of former NSW government minister Pru Goward changed her name after she converted to the religion of Judaism.

However, court documents have listed the former actress under her birth name of Katherine Fischer.

The former model wore a simple black dress with an asymmetrical hem, a white jacket and a pair of black and white sneakers as she arrived at Sydney's Downing Centre. 

She tied her caramel-hued locks in a high bun and had a black bag slung over her shoulder.

Meanwhile, in July it was revealed a bizarre love triangle involving Tziporah and two ex-partners - one a former policeman and the other a female jailbird - is set to play out before the courts. 

Last year the 46-year-old was pictured holding hands with Victoria Rupp at Sydney's Bondi Beach.

But after their relationship fizzled, Tziporah began dating former cop Nicholas Patsidis, 40, also a one-time lover of Rupp's.

Now the trio are also connected by a pair of AVOs. 

Police took out one of the orders to protect Malkah from Patsidis after he was charged with assaulting her.

The other AVO is in place to protect Patsidis from Rupp after she was accused of bombarding the ex-cop with abusive text messages following their split.  

Tziporah will appear at Downing Centre Local Court again on September 25.
