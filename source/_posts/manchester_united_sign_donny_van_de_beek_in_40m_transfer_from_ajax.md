Manchester United have finally completed some transfer business this summer with the capture of Donny van de Beek.

The 23-year-old has joined in a £40million transfer from Dutch giants Ajax.

Van de Beek has signed a five-year contract worth around £107,000-a-week before bonuses.

He becomes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first signing of the summer and could now form part of an exciting midfield trio alongside Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes.

Solskjaer will now push on with plans to at least sign another centre back and a right winger - with Jadon Sancho the No 1 target in the latter position.

Van de Beek had delayed his arrival to the Holland national team camp in order to complete his Manchester United medical.

He is in the Holland squad for their Nations League games at home to Poland and Italy, but will link up with the squad later than was initially planned.

His father, Andre van de Beek, has described the transfer as 'a dream come true'.

As reported by Omroep Gelderland, he said: 'This is a dream come true. It's the perfect moment for him to make this step to such a beautiful club. Many clubs were interested, but Donny took this decision himself.'

Talking from their home village of Nijkerkerveen, Andre said his phone has not stopped since news of the transfer broke. He added: 'Its a proud village.'

Negotiations over a deal for Van de Beek accelerated on Sunday after United stepped up their interest.

Tottenham reportedly made a last-ditch attempt to sign Van de Beek, but he was eager to join United after being convinced by Solskjaer.

A product of Ajax's famous academy, the midfielder has made 175 appearances for the Dutch club, scoring 41 goals.

He won the Eredivisie and the Dutch Cup in the 2018-19 campaign, and was part of the Ajax side that was beaten by United in the 2017 Europa League final.
