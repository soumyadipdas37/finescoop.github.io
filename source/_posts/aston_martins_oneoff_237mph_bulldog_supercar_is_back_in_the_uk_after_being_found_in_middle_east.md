Classic car experts have tracked down the legendary Aston Martin Bulldog and are in the process of restoring it to its former glory, it has been revealed.

The Aston Martin Bulldog was a one-off supercar concept produced in 1979 in an effort to show off the capabilities of the company's new engineering facility in Milton Keynes.

Initially a production run of 15 to 25 cars was planned but the project was deemed too expensive and only one was ever built. 

The car, designed by William Towns, was produced in 1979 and was the only one ever built

The car once reached speeds of 192mph but Top Gear experts estimate it could reach 237mph

Now the son of former Aston Martin boss Victor Gauntlett has tracked down the vehicle and is heading up a project to restore it.

Speaking to the BBC, Richard Gauntlett described the car as a 'mythical creature' and said no one has seen it run in at least 30 years.

He added: 'There's a great deal of personal meaning to this because I was obsessed with the car as a child.'

The car was located in the Far East and was bought by an American Bulldog fan before it was transported to Shropshire where it will be restored by a team of experts headed by Richard.

The car's futuristic design with gullwing doors and wedge shaped body was popular with fans

Experts estimate the restoration project, in Shropshire, will take up to a year to be completed

The two-door coupe style car broke records when it reached 192mph in 1980 with its sleek futuristic design and Aston Martin 5.3-litre V8 engine but Top Gear experts estimate it was capable of going as fast as 237mph.

The vehicle itself was was 15ft 6in long and just 43in tall, with a pair of electro-hydraulically operated gullwing doors.

Inside, the supercar's interior was upholstered in leather and used multiple LED buttons.  

In 1981, when Victor Gauntlett became chairman of Aston Martin, he decided the project would be too costly, and the project was shelved. 

In 1984, the Bulldog was sold to a middle eastern collector for £130,000 before reportedly spending time in the United States.

Experts estimate the project will take about a year to complete.
