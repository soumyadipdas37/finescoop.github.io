They're stunning models who have dazzled on dozens of catwalks. 

And Kendall Jenner, 24, made an uncharacteristically low-key arrival in a crop top and tracksuit bottoms at Milan Fashion Week on Friday.

Joining the beauty was her pal Hailey Bieber, 23, who also opted for a casual look in an oversized black jacket and trainers.

Kendall ensured she was comfortable for her journey in loose fitting bottoms and added another layer by donning a checked shirt.

The brunette beauty wore her locks down and let them bounce over her shoulders as she exited the airport.

Not forgetting her accessories, Kendall toted a large Louis Vuitton holdall and added some cool shades.

Hayley also cut a fashionable figure in a large black coat which she paired with a simple t-shirt and baseball cap.

She tied her blonde locks back into a ponytail and added a selection of stylish rings and necklaces to complete her look.

Both of the models made sure to stay safe and follow travel regulations during the coronavirus pandemic by wearing face coverings as they arrived in Milan. 

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in Hugo Boss' show on Friday.

Kendall's trip comes after her sister Kylie was left unimpressed by a snap shared by their eldest sister Kim Kardashian. 

'Delete this immediately,' Kylie, 23, instructed Kim, 39, in the comments section of the photo, which was taken circa 2009 and posted Friday. 

In response, Kim hilariously referenced P Diddy's penchant for shamelessly cropping out celebrities from his photos.  

'Should I Diddy crop you out?' Kim asked. 

'Absolutely,' Kylie replied back.

Fine by me! Kylie approved a 'Diddy crop' of the photo, allowing her sister to shamelessly remove her from the image 

Fans flooded the comments section, remarking on just how different everyone looked in the flashback photo than they appear nowadays. 

The women did all look dramatically different, whether it be because of their young age at the time the snap was taken or because of their hair color.  

The photo appeared to have been taken at a restaurant, where Kim and Khloe sat at the table while their younger sisters posed beside them.

Pre-teen Kylie rocked a side-swept bang and allowed her freckles to shine through with hardly a touch of makeup on her face.

Kim still looked glam as she sat at the center of the table, with her honey-hued locks perfectly sleeked to the side.  

Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling.
