AFL WAG Rebecca Judd was shocked this week to hear that Americans don't use kettles. 

Speaking on her KIIS FM radio show, the 3pm Pick Up on Tuesday, Rebecca said it's 'weird' that they instead microwave their water.

'Having a kettle is like a way of life, you use it for so much more than having a tea,' Rebecca said.

Rebecca said she first found out that they don't use kettles on Instagram, as she follows an Australian author who has a big American following.  

'Something slid into her DMs from one of her American followers and it's the fact that Americans don't have kettles. This is weird,' Bec said. 

She added: 'It's more than just the tea, having a kettle is like a way of life, you use it for so much more than having a tea.'

Say what? Rebecca said the discovery left her 'shook'

The mother-of-four said she likes to use her kettle to make cups of noodles, to dissolve chicken stock, and to water her indoor plants. 

She then shared an audio clip of Kim Kardashian saying she has two kettles in her home, but Kim wasn't aware that the 'pots' are called kettles.

'Kim, it's a kettle!' Bec said with a laugh.

Bec lives a $7.3million mansion in Brighton, Melbourne, with husband Chris Judd and their four children, son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins Tom and Darcy, three.

Rebecca and Chris have been married for 10 years.

In recent weeks they've been stuck in lockdown at home, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Bec admitted on her radio show that she's over the stage-four restrictions and can't wait to travel interstate for a holiday.

It came after the 37-year-old kicked her three-year-old twin sons, Tom and Darcy, outside after they trashed her stylish living room.

'I'm done... I'm out,' Bec said. 

Melbourne has been under stage-four lockdown since August 2, following a spike in coronavirus cases in the state of Victoria.

Residents can only leave their homes for food and essential items, daily exercise, care for others, and work if they cannot work from home.
