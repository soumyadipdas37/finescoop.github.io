Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has not ruled Son Heung-min out of Sunday's game with Manchester United.

Son picked up a hamstring injury in last weekend's draw with Newcastle and Mourinho previously said he would not be fit until after the international break.

'Sonny of course is not playing tomorrow,' the Portuguese said ahead of Spurs' Europa League play-off tie with Maccabi Haifa.

Jose Mourinho said Son won't play against Maccabi Haifa but hopes he'll be fit for Man United

'He's a doubt for Sunday, a big doubt. I don't want to say he doesn't play and then he does because my position is in doubt.'

Son has been one of Tottenham's best players this season, scoring five times in five matches.

Mourinho has been desperate to sign another striker to ease the burden on Harry Kane and the Tottenham boss is confident one will arrive before next Monday's deadline.

He added:Â 'I am optimistic, but more than that, the feeling that I like is that we are trying everything to do it.'

Mourinho also said he is 'optimistic' about signing a striker to provide cover for Harry Kane
