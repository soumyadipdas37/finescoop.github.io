The CDC recommends face masks, along with hand washing and proper social distance measures, to help slow the spread of the virus. 

Late last month, Harrison gave the ultimate tribute to his late co-star Chadwick Boseman who died at the age of 43 following complications from colon cancer. 

In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, the Star Wars actor called Boseman 'as much a hero as any he played.'

The pair costarred in the 2013 film 42 which followed the life of baseball legend Jackie Robinson.

'Chadwick Boseman was as compelling, powerful and truthful as the characters he chose to play,' Ford said in the statement. 'His intelligence, personal dignity and deep commitment inspired his colleagues and elevated the stories he told. He is as much a hero as any he played.

'He is loved and will be deeply missed.'

Ford will jump back into his Indiana Jones roots in 2022 with an as-yet untitled project, but will first take on the role of a grieving husband who is accused of killing his wife in the TV-series The Staircase.
