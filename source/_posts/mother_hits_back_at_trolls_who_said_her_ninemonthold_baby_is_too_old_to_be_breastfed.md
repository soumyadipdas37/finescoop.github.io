An Australian mother has hit back at online bullies who said her nine-month-old son was too old to be breastfed.  

Leah-Marie Britton, 21, proudly shared a photo of herself breastfeeding her baby Luca-James in solidarity with the #NormaliseBreastfeeding movement on social media, only to have sexual remarks directed her way.

'During the course of breastfeeding I have experienced many unexpected comments and remarks,' the Gold Coast mum said.

'I have received foul looks when feeding in public, especially the older he gets, and online, people are even worse as they have a screen to hide behind.

'After posting beautiful footage feeding my son, someone said "Tad too old to be breastfeeding don't you think, why not just give him a bottle?"'

'And then I received a comment from another person saying, "I think it would just be some blokes looking at some t*tty, why post a video of something like that in the first place?"'

The beauty therapist shared these troll comments with her followers, who messaged her to say they have experienced very similar things.

'Many women commented saying they have been told to feed their baby in the toilets or they need to cover up, or that the baby is old to be breastfeeding,' she said

'Some even said they gave up breastfeeding due to such incidents, which I feel is so unfair on both mother and baby.'

According to Victoria's Eat for Health website it's recommended that Australians exclusively breastfeed infants until they are six months of age when solid foods are introduced.

Then it's recommended that they continue feeding until 12 months of age and beyond 'for as long as the mother and child desire'.

'I was initially very angry that people could make remarks about a woman feeding her child,' Leah-Marie said.

The breastfeeding journey hasn't always been smooth sailing for Leah-Marie, who found it hard at first to correctly latch and worried her son wasn't getting enough milk

'New mothers shouldn't be afraid to feed their baby whenever and wherever they need, just because some uneducated individuals disagree.'

On top of that a woman is learning to be comfortable with feeding in front of people, which doesn't always come as second nature.

'As a new mother I experienced many different issues with feeding, from cracked nipples to severe cases of mastitis,' Leah-Marie said.

'I am super proud I have managed to feed him for nine months and will continue to do so until he is ready to wean.'

She is using her Instagram page to share more on the topic of breastfeeding and hoping to encourage other mothers to choose the feeding option that is right for them. 

'Breastfeeding has created a beautiful bond between me and my son and despite all the difficulties we have faced I wouldn't change it for the world,' she said.
