EastEnders' star Kellie Bright has revealed she accidentally wet herself on her on-screen husband Danny Dyer's shoulder while filming. 

The actress, 44, was shooting a scene as Linda Carter which required the actor, 43, to pick her up and throw her on the bed.  

Kellie told Stacey Dooley and her co-star Letitia Dean about the awkward mishap in the Landladies special episode of Secrets From The Square, which aired on Friday night.    

Oh dear: EastEnders' star Kellie Bright has revealed she accidentally wet herself on her on-screen husband Danny Dyer's shoulder while filming

Kellie said: 'There was a scene with Danny where I was drunk and he had to throw me over his shoulder.

'It was a scene where I was really screaming at all of the Carters and he had to throw me over his shoulder and throw me onto the bed.

'I got so irate that I wet myself doing the scene…A little bit, not massively.

'But he kept throwing me over his shoulder and I felt I should say to him, so I said: "Dan, listen, I'm really sorry but I wet myself a little bit".

'And he said: "Oh for God's sake!".'

It comes after soap bosses offered fans their first glimpse of filming in the world of COVID-19 - which involves perspex screens, body doubles and even CGI. 

Reliving the moment: Kellie told Stacey Dooley and her co-star Letitia Dean about the awkward mishap in the Landladies special episode of Secrets From The Square, which aired on Friday 

Seeing red: Kellie said: 'There was a scene with Danny where I was drunk and he had to throw me over his shoulder. It was a scene where I was really screaming at all of the Carters'

Embarrassing: 'But he kept throwing me over his shoulder and I felt I should say to him, so I said: "Dan, listen, I'm really sorry but I wet myself a little bit"

Executive producer Jon Sen revealed bosses had to 'cheat' the social distancing rules with protective screens and have even drafted in the help of stars' real-life partners as body doubles for intimate scenes. 

EastEnders is set to return to screens on Monday, September 7 after it was forced off air when production was suspended during the crisis. 

Speaking to MailOnline at the soap's virtual launch, Jon explained that like many other soaps they've used clever camera methods to hide the two metre distance between cast members.  

Entertaining: Stacey laughed as Kellie told her story 

But he also revealed that they've used perspex screens between stars to continue filming passionate kiss scenes, and have even used some of the cast's real-life partners as body doubles.

He said: 'When we came back we had to devise methods where we could cheat the distance, it's very odd shooting like this, never before in TV history have we made drama in this way, certainly we were forced to work with this 2 metre rule.'
