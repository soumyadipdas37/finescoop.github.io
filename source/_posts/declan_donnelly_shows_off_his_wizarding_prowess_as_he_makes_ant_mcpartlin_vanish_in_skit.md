Declan Donnelly and Ant McPartlin were up to their usual mischievous antics in their latest Instagram video, posted on Tuesday.

In the funny skit, Dec, 44, labelled himself 'Deccy Potter' as he found a magic wand behind the sofa and proceeded to use it to make Ant reappear and disappear.

With slapstick music playing in the background, Dec pointed his wand at Ant, 44, who was reading, and made him disappear. 

The Saturday Night Takeaway host then ran through the studios, stopped to sanitise his hands, before pointing his wand to a set of metal gates to make Ant reappear behind bars.

Ant howled with annoyance as he banged the bars while Dec ran off giggling.

The duo captioned the shot: 'Pretty fond of my wand! #deccypotter'. 

Magician Stephen Mulhern commented: 'Ministry of magic will be mad at u though, posting this for muggles ;)' (sic), while other fans typed: 'Stephen won’t be happy about this'. 

It comes after Dec revealed that he wanted to quit acting aged 11 and become a priest when he was turned down for the lead role in the kids' show Geordie Racer.

The presenter described how he almost turned his back on showbiz after being rejected from the children's series.  

The star told how he 'briefly considered' following the career of his brother, Father Dermott Donnelly, who even conducted Dec's wedding to Ali Astall in 2015. 

In an extract, according to The Mirror, from his first autobiography with Ant, Ooh! What a Lovely Pair, he wrote: 'After that crushing rejection, I made a momentous decision: that was it - I was going to retire from acting. I was eleven.' 

And Dec, who is the youngest of seven children, described how he contemplated turning to religion after his audition didn't go to plan. 

He continued: 'Later on, when I was about fourteen, I did briefly consider following in his footsteps, and the footsteps of my Godfather, Father O'Connell, and becoming a priest.'
