Harry Redknapp has said that he doesn't 'want to talk' about his son Jamie's new relationship because the 'last thing' he would want is to 'upset' daughter-in-law Louise Redknapp.

Football manager Harry, 73, described his son's new girlfriend Frida Andersson-Lourie as 'lovely' and 'very nice'.

Jamie's relationship with the Swedish model is thought to be his first since his split from singer Louise in 2017, with whom he shares two sons, after 19 years of marriage. 

Open: Harry Redknapp, 73, has said that he doesn't 'want to talk about Jamie's new relationship' because the 'last thing' he would want is to upset daughter-in-law Louise Redknapp, 45

Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'We did meet Frida and she is lovely, very nice, but I don’t want to talk about Jamie’s new relationship.

'The last thing I want to do is upset Lou. It is upsetting that Jamie and Lou aren’t together. It was a complete shock.' 

The football pundit revealed how Louise is 'still part of the family' as the mother of his grandchildren Charley, 16, and Beau 11, and they still keep in touch.

He added: 'We love Lou, we still speak to her of course. Sandra speaks to her mum.' 

Last month former footballer Jamie, 45, was photographed heading on a dog walk with  mother-of-four, Frida, 37, near his home in Surrey, in pictures obtained by The Sun. 

A source told the publication: 'Jamie feels ready to move on from his marriage to Louise and is happy to be doing it with someone who has kids too and is financially secure.

'It's early days for Jamie and Frida, but they have grown close and are really enjoying spending time together when they can.' 

Frida is currently signed to Mrs Robinson Management, an agency for older models, and has previously appeared in content for designer brands such as Escada.  

Earlier this year Louise jetted off to Ibiza with her two sons for a sun-drenched getaway. 

In an Instagram post, Louise looked back on her summer and shared a series of pictures, captioned: 'So grateful for the summer I had with my boys and amazing friends.'
