Essex took a narrow advantage in county cricket’s inaugural red-ball ‘cup final’ on the day it emerged the three-conference system is here to stay.

Last year’s county champions reduced perennial runners-up Somerset to 119 for four on a rain-affected first day of the Bob Willis Trophy final as Lord’s staged the first of what is set to become a regular first-class showpiece climax to the domestic season.

This late-season clash of the best two red-ball teams in the country is likely to be a low-scoring affair, mainly because of the two potent attacks, and it was Essex who struck the first blows in the 44 overs possible.

Sam Cook made the breakthrough in his first over to claim his 100th first-class wicket

Sam Cook, Little Chef to Sir Alastair Cook’s Chef in the Essex nickname stakes, made the breakthrough in his first over to have Somerset’s exciting young opener Tom Lammonby plumb lbw for a duck to claim his 100th first-class wicket. ‘To reach that landmark here at the home of cricket was a special feeling,’ said Cook.

The younger unrelated Cook also bowled Ben Green with a beauty that clipped off-stump but it was the least effective Essex bowler in Aaron Beard who claimed the key wicket of Somerset captain Tom Abell thanks to a spectacular leg-side catch from keeper Adam Wheater.

When Jamie Porter, seemingly now out of the England picture after being unlucky not to play Test cricket during four years of consistent wicket-taking, had George Bartlett caught low at slip by Essex’s knight, Somerset looked ripe for implosion.

Somerset's Eddie Byrom hit three boundaries in one Beard over and moved to an unbeaten 51

But the rain returned to deny Essex the chance of makings serious inroads into a Somerset batting line-up relying almost totally on a counter attack from Eddie Byrom, a 23-year-old Zimbabwean with an Irish passport.

Byrom hit three boundaries in one Beard over and moved to an unbeaten 51 to give Somerset hope of the total of around 200 that would keep them very much in the hunt to win what has been a successful substitute competition for the Championship.

‘Eddie wrestled a bit of momentum back towards us and I think it’s left it nicely balanced now,’ said Somerset opener Green afterwards.

So positive has been the response to the structure of the trophy in this Covid blighted season that county chairmen are set to vote in the introduction of a conference system next year in place of the two-division championship.

The three-conference system is here to stay with a five-day 'Test' at Lord's in early October

Sportsmail understands the plan, which will culminate in another five-day county ‘Test’ at Lord’s in early October, will be adopted on a one-year trial basis with cricket still uncertain whether supporters will be allowed back in 2021.

The three six-team conferences will be seeded on final places from last year’s championship, with each side playing the others in their conferences home and away before then being split into three divisions for four more late season games.

The top two will then take part in the final for both the Championship title and the Bob Willis Trophy, which will be retained in honour of the great England bowler and broadcaster who died from prostate cancer last December.
