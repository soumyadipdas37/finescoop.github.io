A British woman was allegedly raped by three men in Italy and threatened to jump off a balcony after the ordeal, local media says. 

The 32-year-old tourist called police from a holiday home in Lecce after she was allegedly attacked in a different apartment by young men she had spent the evening with.

According to Lecce Prima, she returned to where she was staying near the Piazza Sant'Oronzo and appeared poised to jump off a building as dawn broke. 

She was spotted by alarmed passers-by who called the police, who brought the woman to safety and took her to hospital.  

A British woman threatened to jump from a balcony near the Piazza Sant'Oronzo (file image) in Lecce after allegedly being raped by three men, local reports say 

After being rescued, the woman told police officers and hospital doctors about the alleged sex attack by three men.  

Italian detectives are now looking at surveillance camera footage from the piazza and its surroundings as they investigate the case.  

Reports say she was staying with a friend and had been with that person earlier in the evening, but they separated before the alleged attack.  

After meeting 'a group of other young people' and drinking with them she was allegedly raped in an apartment where they had spent the evening.    

On returning to her holiday home, the woman reportedly fell into a rage and her screams could be heard in nearby buildings. 

The investigation is ongoing.
