Harry Potter fans were left furious after they queued for hours to catch a glimpse of the Hogwarts Express, only for a ScotRail train to block their view. 

The Jacobite steam train travelled through Drumry train station in Dunbartonshire on its return journey from Carnforth in Lancashire on Monday.

The famous locomotive and carriages starred in several installments of the world-famous Harry Potter movie franchise.

Dedicated Harry Potter fans, including young children, piled into the station to catch a glimpse of the train, but the 4.12pm train to Dalmuir blocked one platform from seeing the locomotive, the Daily Herald reported.

A video shared on Twitter shows the commercial train speeding past the platform at the same time as the famous locomotive, much to the disappointment of fans.

Traditional carriages on West Coast Railways's Jacobite steam trains were featured in the Harry Potter films, with fans flocking to see famous steam train

One woman is heard saying: 'Of course that's going to have happened.'

In the video, one platform of fans can be heard shrieking in delight as they watch the traditional steam train, while the other side of the station are not as impressed. 

By the time the ScotRail train clears from view, some of the fans are only able to see the back of the steam train speeding off into the distance. 

But some fans manage to see the funny side of the unfortunate timing, with one person saying on Twitter: 'Everyone buzzing about this Harry Potter Train, can't help myself but laugh at the people at Drumry Station. 

'Platform one on route to Hogwarts Express Platform two the 16.12 to Dalmuir just going about their business.'

Another joked: 'Sometimes we all pick the wrong side.'

Traditional carriages on 'The Jacobite' train were used in the filming of Harry Potter, with West Coast Railways also sourcing a suitable steam engine for Warner Brothers.

Hundreds of Harry Potter fans queued at various train stations across Scotland to try and catch a fleeting glimpse of the iconic locomotive.

But on Monday, the fans of the franchise were slammed as 'idiotic' on social media after piling on to the station's platform, with locals claiming they ignored coronavirus social distancing guidelines.

Many people who saw pictures and videos of the scene claimed that fans in the large crowd had not worn face masks and were not staying two metres away from each other.

One person took to Twitter to express their anger, saying: 'Yes, it’s a train from Harry Potter, but I think there are much more important things going on.'

West Coast Railways allowed the famous wizarding train to use the route of The Jacobite train, including passing over the scenic famous Glenfinnan viaduct.

The 5972 Olton Hall is the model that became famous in the early 2000s as the face of the Hogwarts Express.

The Jacobite is a real-life steam-locomotive hauled tourist train service, which runs across iconic settings in Scotland.
