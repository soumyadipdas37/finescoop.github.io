Some Bachelor fans are convinced Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska won't last as a couple based on their body language during media interviews on Friday.

Following Thursday night's finale, the pair stopped by The Kyle and Jackie O Show and posed for a selfie with hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson.

The seemingly innocent photo, which shows Irena slinging an arm around her boyfriend's shoulders as they smile for the camera, has been closely analysed online - and some naysayers believe it's 'proof' the pair are heading for a break-up.

'Classic example of "Fake it til you make it"!' one cynical viewer commented.

Another suggested the couple looked more like friends, saying: 'It looks more like a mate the way she put an arm around his shoulder'.

A third wrote: 'You need to get that body language person on this photo looks awkward... she's leaning into him and has her arm around him and he doesn't look that into her.'

Perfect match: Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, Matchsmith body language expert Holly Bartter insisted the new couple are well suited

But an actual body language expert told Daily Mail Australia on Friday afternoon that Locky and Irena's physical cues actual point to a happy and long-lasting relationship.

Holly Bartter guru and Matchsmith founder Holly Bartter analysed footage of the pair in the KIIS FM studio and concluded they 'look really in sync'. 

The fact their arms were folded at the start of the chat - which is usually a sign of conflict - was most likely just them feeling nervous about the interview, she said.

'Locky looks at Irena as she responds, a bit in awe of her, they sit close but not all over each other,' Ms Bartter explained. 

'Irena seems very self-assured, lots of touching of the hands and leaning into one another without being all over each other, and lots of smiling at one another.'

Bartter said they 'seem well-matched and connected', and said that Locky appeared 'head over heels and smitten' with Irena. 

'They seem content with one another, and it looks like he's made the right decision,' said body language expert Holly Bartter

'They seem content with one another, and it looks like he's made the right decision,' she observed. 

'Irena is level-headed and consistent for him. She knows what she wants, and her confidence brings out the confidence and certainty in him further.'

A conflicted Locky chose Irena as his winning contestant during The Bachelor's emotional finale on Thursday.

'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.

Moments earlier, he'd delivered the bad news to runner-up Bella Varelis - despite having told her earlier in the episode he was 'falling in love' with her.
