Australian amateur bakers have invented the 'world's easiest cake recipe' using just two ingredients: pre-made vanilla or golden butter mix and a tin of apple slices in juice.

Forget butter, milk and eggs, this homegrown dessert gets its 'moist' middle from the extra juice inside the apples - and it can be whipped up for less than $4.

'After seeing a lot about the "two Ingredient cake" and reading everyone's hot tips I had to try it,' one woman wrote on Facebook.

'It's AMAZING! And so easy. I won't buy cake again if I've got the time to cook this.'

To make the perfect after dinner dessert start by chopping and draining the tinned apples. Some people also mix a small amount of cinnamon into the apple mixture for a different flavour profile.

Then mix the apples with either a vanilla or golden butter cake mix until it's a syrupy concoction.

Spray the edges of a cake tin with cooking oil and pour the batter in. One woman poured half, added a thin layer of cold custard to the middle, before pouring the second half. 

INGREDIENTS:

- Butter cake mix

- Tinned apple slices in juice

Optional extras: 

- Cinnamon

- Layer of cold custard in middle

METHOD:

1. Chop and drain the tinned apples. If you'd like to mix cinnamon into the apples do so now.

2.  Mix the apples with the cake mix.

3. Spray the edges of a tin with cooking spray and put the cake into a fan forced oven at 160 degrees for 40 minutes.  



Then simply place the tin into a fan forced oven at 160 degrees for 40 minutes and you'll be left with the ultimate apple cake

Other mothers have wanted to add a crumble to the top of the cake to give it a slightly heightened sense of elegance

The apples can be substituted for a fruit salad mixture if you'd prefer a slightly different taste

'Omg thought I would get on the bandwagon with everyone else and try this two ingredient cake mix and to my surprise it's the best cake ever,' another woman said. 

A different lady said she tried a gluten-free cake mix for her husband, who is coeliac, and got the same delicious result.  

'It was a real hit. I'll definitely make this again, and warm with custard would make a fabulous dessert,' she said.
