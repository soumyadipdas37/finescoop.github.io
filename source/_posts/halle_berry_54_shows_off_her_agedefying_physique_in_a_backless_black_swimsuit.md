Halle is a mother-of-two, to daughter Nahla, 12, with ex Gabriel Aubry, and son Maceo, six, with ex-husband Olivier Martinez.

The actress has also previously been married to Eric Benét and David Justice. 

The Catwoman star this past April appeared on an Instagram Live stream with her friend Lena Waithe, talking about her love life and parenting amid the early days of the COVID-19 shutdown.

'I've learned a lot being with my children,' she said. 'They are the best company for me right now, and when I divorced Maceo's dad I've been pretty alone by myself going on three years now. Decidedly so, for sure.

'I have decided to take time. I'm very much a relationship-oriented person, I always want to be with someone. But I decided, no I'm going to slow my roll, I'm going to take a minute and I'm going to spent time with me. And it's been so great that I think I might stay like this!'
