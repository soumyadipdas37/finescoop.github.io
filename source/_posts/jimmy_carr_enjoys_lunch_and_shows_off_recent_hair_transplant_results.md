Jimmy Carr showed off the rather impressive results of his recent hair transplant as he stepped out for lunch with friends on Sunday. 

The comedian revealed a notably thicker head of hair while enjoying an al fresco meal in London's trendy Primrose Hill. 

Carr, 47, decided to tackle his receding hairline head on by booking himself in for a transplant earlier this year.

And the result was undeniable, with the funnyman revealing a significantly fuller head of hair during his latest public appearance. 

Carr surprised fans by admitting he opted for the procedure during an appearance on former footballer Peter Crouch's Save Our Summer at the height of Britain's lockdown in June. 

When grilled by presenter Maya Jama over his youthful look he joked that his hair had 'socially distanced from his forehead' - and that he looked like a 'snooker-playing vampire'.

In the thick of it: The comedian's hairline looked more even than usual as he settled down for lunch

Carr looked almost unrecognisable as he debuted a lighter coloured buzzcut, a huge contrast to his past signature raven-coloured quiff.

Maya quizzed: 'It's a very different look for you', to which he replied: 'I tell you what I did, I went and had a hair transplant. I kinda had a look of... like a snooker-playing vampire.'

He continued: 'So what happened was my hair was socially distancing from my forehead and I'd had enough of it.

'I shaved my head and what they do is take hairs from the back of your head and they put them on the front.

'Basically I had enough hair, it was just in the wrong place. It was a bit of redistribution.'

The funnyman, who hosts Channel 4 panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats, also admitted that he was considering getting a hair transplant last year.

He said on The Jonathan Ross Show: 'We were talking about hair transplants. I want a proper Elvis quiff. I want to go big. Go big or go home.

'It's showbusiness baby, let's enjoy ourselves.'
