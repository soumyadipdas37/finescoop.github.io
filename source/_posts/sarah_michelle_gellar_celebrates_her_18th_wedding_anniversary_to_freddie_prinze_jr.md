Sarah Michelle Gellar is celebrating 18 years of marriage with her husband Freddie Prinze Jr.

The actress, 43, shared two intimate, black-and-white photos from their wedding day in 2002 as she marked the special occasion on Instagram on Tuesday.

'You... are my favorite husband #happyanniversary,' she captioned the sweet snaps.

Congratulations! Sarah Michelle Gellar is celebrating 18 years of marriage with her husband Freddie Prinze Jr.

Sarah and Freddie, 44, tied the knot in Mexico just two years after they first started dating.

The couple both starred in the hit 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer before becoming romantically involved in real life.

The intimate photos showed the nearly newlywed couple at the altar, both wearing matching white.

Sarah looked every inch the blushing bride as she held hands with her husband-to-be at the alter, listening to the officiant.

The Buffy The Vampire Slayer actress and her beau flashed a smile as they prepared to become man and wife.

Now, nearly 20 years later, the couple are parents of two.

Sarah and her husband welcomed daughter Charlotte in 2009, followed by son Rocky in 2012. 

The stars were friends for two years before becoming romantic, which Freddie credits for their thriving, long-lasting relationship.

'We just became friends. It's one of the reasons I think our relationship has always been so good,' he told E! in 2017. 'We were friends for a good two years before we ever went on a date. She knew what kind of guy I was, she knew what my morals were, my priorities were, and vice versa.'

Though they were opposites, Freddie said that ended up working to their favor.

'Neither one of us would have ever - if you ask her, she would have been like, "Oh my God, I thought he was a dork." And I'd be like, "Oh my gosh, she just ran a million miles an hour and I couldn't keep up with her."

'We ended up being the perfect balance, you know what I mean? But it didn't happen until years after, and there was a solid foundation built, and that's probably the main reason why we've always been cool and grooving.'
