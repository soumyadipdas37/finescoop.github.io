Jennifer Garner was ready for Casual Friday on Thursday.

The actress, 48, appeared to be going to a low-key meeting in Brentwood, dressed down in a black T-shirt, leggings, and trainers.

However, she did carry a small stack of notebooks - proving she meant business.

The star was spotted determinedly strolling towards her destination, juggling the notebooks with a pen, cell phone, and pair of glasses.

While the sun may not have been out, that was no excuse for Jennifer not to protect her eyesight.

The actress put safety first with her stylish sunglasses.

Jennifer's outing comes a little over a week after more details about her relationship with her businessman ex John Miller came to light.

Jennifer began dating John following the end of her marriage to Ben Affleck, and it has been reported the businessman entered her life 'at a low point', a source told Us Weekly.

'Jen says John brought her back to life,' according to the source, although 'it just wasn't meant to be.' 

News that Jennifer and John were dating came out in October 2018, with US Weekly reporting that they had been dating for six months after her split from Ben.

Garner split from John Miller in early August after two years of dating. John 'came into her life at a low point' following her split from ex husband Ben Affleck, Us Weekly's source said.

John 'became someone very significant,' proving 'that there were men who could be trusted.'

The insider noted that he made Jennifer 'feel beautiful, confident and sexy.'

The lovebirds are reportedly still friends following their split, the outlet's source said.

Jennifer and John had conversations about marriage 'but Jen couldn't see herself married to him' and 'couldn't commit.' 

 The source revealed that 'he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her,' and 'was devastated' since he 'was ready to propose.'  

John, who is the CEO of CaliGroup, was previously married to Caroline Campbell; they share two children.

A third source told Us Weekly: 'John and Jen are in similar places in their lives and can relate to raising kids after a divorce,' adding: 'They're on the same page and understand where things stand.' 

The couple split in early August after two years of dating. 

Jennifer and Ben married in 2005 in Turks and Caicos, announced their split in June 2015, and had their divorce finalized in October 2018.
