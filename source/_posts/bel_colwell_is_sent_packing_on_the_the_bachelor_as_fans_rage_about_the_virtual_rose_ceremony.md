Bec Colwell was sent packing on Thursday's episode of The Bachelor after she failed to receive a rose from Locky Gilbert.

At the end of the episode, the show's first-ever virtual rose ceremony saw each of the remaining ladies standing by a rose. However, they could only pick it up if Locky called out their name. 

Following the outcome, fans slammed the ceremony on Twitter, with one viewer commenting on how 'weird' it must have been for Bel, 25.

'So Bel has a rose next to her but she can't 'accept' it? What a weird way to do it? Could they have not thought of anything else,' questioned one viewer on Twitter.

Meanwhile, others simply raged over the virtual ceremony, labeling it 'cringeworthy' and 'awkward'. 

'If there is anything more cringe-worthy than watching a bachelor rose ceremony being run over what must be zoom, I don't want to know about it,' wrote one fan. 

 'Awkward for the person who just gets to look at their rose and not pick it up,' quipped a second fan of the show.

'The girls already have a rose on a silver platter at their houses??!!! How freaking contrived is this??!!' added a third fan. 

Meanwhile, a fourth said: 'I feel like having a single rose on a platter near them [is] worse than a normal rose ceremony.'

The unusual rose ceremony comes after Locky shocked viewers by sending home five women on Wednesday night's episode.

Areeba Emmanuel, Charley Bond, Gemma White, Laura Calleri and Marg Zogoulas were all sent packing.

Areeba, 25, didn't hold back at the end of the episode, saying this year's Bachelor clearly had a penchant for 'basic girls'.

'This is definitely the first time I have ever been rejected by a guy. I don't care because he obviously likes basic girls, and that's not me. I ain't basic,' she pouted.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel Ten
