Today host Karl Stefanovic raised eyebrows on Thursday when his language was bleeped out twice during a hot topics segment.

The 46-year-old appeared to swear while discussing a viral news story about several parrots at a British wildlife park - but it was actually just a stitch-up by producers.

Explaining the story to his guests, including politician Jacqui Lambie, Karl said: 'The park's boss said, "Every time I walk past I get called a fat *beep*."'

Karl added with a laugh that when he was a child, his uncle also had a swearing bird. 

'When I was a kid, my uncle Rob had a cockatoo and every time I would walk past it would call me a fat *beep*. What do you think, Jacqui?'

Karl didn't actually swear during the segment, which can be discerned by reading his lips, but his language was bleeped out anyway.

This was most likely an inside joke arranged by Today's producers. 

Cheeky! The 46-year-old appeared to say 'fat t**t' when talking about how five cheeky parrots were removed from the Lincolnshire Wildlife Park in the UK for swearing and saying the derogatory remark

It comes after Karl shut down Sam Dastyari earlier this week after he made a very awkward remark about cheating husbands on the Today show. 

The 37-year-old, known as 'Shanghai Sam' for his involvement in a Chinese donations scandal which eventually led to his resignation in January 2018, made a rather awkward gaffe on Today on Tuesday. 

During a lighthearted segment with host Karl and journalist Anna Caldwell, Sam put his foot in it while discussing an amusing story about a cheating husband.

Karl began: 'How's this for a wife's revenge - forcing her cheating husband to parade around their neighbourhood dressed in pink as a brutal get-back. Sam?'  

Sam replied: 'Well, look, firstly as someone who's gone through a divorce, I can safely say that's not something I was forced to do.

'And I don't think you were either, Karl.'

Perhaps realising what he had just suggested about himself and Karl on national TV, Sam laughed nervously and tried to find a way to wrap things up.  

'I mean, look, it's not going to work, it's not going to end well if that's how you're going to try and make your relationship work, good luck to you.... by the way, I thought wearing pink was okay?' he said.

Karl sternly clarified: 'I guess if you're a cheater, Sam.' 

Revenge: Karl began: 'How's this for a wife's revenge - forcing her cheating husband to parade around their neighbourhood dressed in pink as a brutal get-back. Sam?'

Putting his foot in it: Sam replied: 'Well, look, firstly as someone who's gone through a divorce, I can safely say that's not something I was forced to do. 'And I don't think you were either, Karl'

'Well, look, I mean that's certainly not me but, er, but look I think...' Sam responded, before bursting into awkward laughter.

Karl, 46, brushed off Sam's gaffe, and later told him and Anna: 'I thought you guys would be much lighter on that one. You guys took it very seriously. Anyway, onwards and upwards!'

'Too many scars there, Karl. Too many scars!' Sam added, signing off. 

Sam was only joking of course, and Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting that he or Karl has been unfaithful in the past.

Former Labor senator Sam clarified in January last year that his split from his wife of eight years, Helen ­Barron, was 'very amicable'.

Karl has also made it clear that he did not meet his now-wife, Jasmine Yarbrough, until five months after he'd split from his first wife, Cassandra Thorburn, in mid-2016.
