Boy George has laughed off reports Lorde and Mariah Carey will be joining The Voice Australia in 2021.

In August, he denied he was 'dumped' from the panel by suggesting the Seven network, who now have the rights for the show, couldn't afford him.

'If the The Voice AU are suggesting that Lorde is cheaper than me then today is a great day! Lol!' Boy George, 59, tweeted on Monday.

'If the The Voice AU are suggesting that Lorde is cheaper than me then today is a great day! Lol!' Boy George, 59, laughed off the recent rumours via Twitter on Monday 

A production source told The Daily Telegraph this week that Seven has approached singers Lorde and Tones and I to join the 2021 coaching panel - likely to replace international stars Kelly Rowland and Boy George.

'One of the big changes Seven plans to make is how much is being spent on judges... They believe Nine was simply paying too much for B-listers,' they added. 

Seven's intended 'cost-cutting measures' may mark the end of celebrity coaches Delta Goodrem, Guy Sebastian, Kelly Rowland and Boy George on the show, but Boy George remains amused by suggestions of their supposed replacements.

'I've never been "dumped" by a network!' Boy George hit back at reports that he was 'dumped' from The Voice Australia last month as Seven is rumoured to replace international stars Kelly Rowland (left) and Boy George (right) with new 'cost-effective' stars

According to a report by The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, Mariah Carey is also 'in talks' to replace long-serving judge Delta Goodrem. 

Boy George also responded to rumours the We Belong Together hit-maker, 50, was in negotiations, by tweeting: 'she ain't doing it!' 

After Nine 'failed to renew its contract' for the 2021 season of The Voice, Seven jumped on the licence 'very quickly'.

Channel Seven's CEO, James Warburton, already has big changes in mind for the show, including cutting the number of episodes and having a tighter production schedule.

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter time frame,' he said.

A Nine spokesperson said last month: 'Unfortunately due to the age of the show and declining demographic profile, The Voice had become by far the poorest financial performer on our slate.

'We wish Seven well in their quest to revive yet another Nine show.' 

Darren McMullen and Renee Bargh, who presented the 2020 season, won't be returning next year. They have been replaced by Sonia Kruger, who used to host the talent show on Nine until she defected to Seven last year.
