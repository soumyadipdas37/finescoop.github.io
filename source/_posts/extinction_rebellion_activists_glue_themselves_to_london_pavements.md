Climate change protesters have glued themselves to the pavements, which had been covered with fake blood, during another day of disruption in central London.

There were protests today outside the Bank of England, as masked demonstrators held pots of fake blood and a sign that read 'business as usual is killing the earth'.

Demonstrators protested claiming that 'apologies are not enough to address the legacy of a financial system rooted in enslavement and supporting ecological devastation'. 

More than 300 people were arrested yesterday during a third day the protests in central London, with the Metropolitan Police saying more than 200 of these were linked to a demonstration on Lambeth Bridge.  

Protests continued today but the Met imposed conditions meaning the gatherings can only take place off the main roads at Parliament Square between 8am and 7pm.

XR wants the Government to declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 and establish a 'citizens' assembly on climate and ecological justice'.

Earlier on Thursday, some protesters glued themselves to the ground around Parliament while others staged a sit-in elsewhere around the perimeter of the parliamentary estate, including at the Carriage Gates. 

A separate protest, carried out by XR ally Animal Rebellion, saw activists glue themselves on top of and inside a pink slaughterhouse truck parked sideways across nearby Victoria Street.

The campaigners said they were demanding 'a plant-based food system as a means to mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis and reduce the risk of future pandemics'.
