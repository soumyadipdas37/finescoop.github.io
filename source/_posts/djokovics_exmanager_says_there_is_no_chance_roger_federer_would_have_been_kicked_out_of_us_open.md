Novak Djokovic's former manager believes that Roger Federer would not have been disqualified for hitting a line-judge in the same manner that the Serb did at the US Open on Sunday. 

The world number one shocked the world of tennis as he was kicked out of the tournament for accidentally hitting a ball at line judge Laura Clark in a moment of frustration during the first set against Pablo Carreno Busta.

Clark keeled over after being struck in the throat and the tournament favourite was defaulted after consultation with officials. But Niki Pilic, who used to manage the 33-year-old, believes there is no chance that 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer would have received the same punishment and accused Clark of 'acting a little.'

Yet Djokovic's ex-manager believes Roger Federer would have got away with a similar incident 

'In my opinion, Novak Djokovic accidentally hit the line-judge with the ball,' Pilic told the Serbian press. 

'I think he should have been punished with a confiscated game. It is not right to disqualify the first in the world because of this.

'I believe that the judge also acted a little, I don't think she was so hurt.

'Do you think Roger Federer would be kicked out for something like this? No chance. This decision is tendentious.' 

Pilic's comments come days after some fans said Federer was not penalised at all for a similar incident at the 2006 Australian Open.  

Djokovic is currently three short of Federer's record-haul of 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles

After his first serve was called out, Federer swung his racket behind his back and inadvertently hit a ball boy at the side of the net.

The Swiss star didn't receive a code violation and the situation was also laughed off by the ball boy at the time.

However, fans have since brought that incident again as they have been comparing it to the Djokovic saga from the past week. 

One fan simply said: 'If Federer did what Djokovic did he wouldn't be disqualified. The ATP hates to see Djokovic win.'

The incident involving Federer back in 2006 was laughed off by everyone court-side

Another wrote: 'I'm not the biggest Djokovic fan but I would 100% agree that there was no anger or malice in that incident. 

'I can't believe the extent of his punishment. I also agree that had that been Federer it would have been a totally different outcome.' 

Yet with Djokovic's disqualification, the US Open men's singles draw is wide open ahead of the semi-finals on Friday. 

Busta, who was the beneficiary of Djokovic's default, plays Alexander Zverev, while third seed Daniil Medvedev takes on second seed Dominic Thiem in the second semi-final as all four players bid to win their first major title.
