They tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in 2015. 

And Michelle Keegan and Mark Wright looked like the perfect couple as they were spotted on a rare date night in Cheshire on Saturday. 

The actress, 33, displayed her phenomenal physique in a beige knitted dress as she left the restaurant with her husband, 33.

Michelle cut a stylish figure in the knitted off-the-shoulder midi dress that she paired with beige sandal heels. 

She wore a makeup pallet of neutral warm tones and styled her luscious locks in natural loose waves. 

The Our Girl star showcased her peachy derriere in tight-fitting ribbed dress as she headed back to the car with Mark and clutched a chic cream quilted Gucci bag.

Mark, meanwhile, sported a stone-grey pinstripe bomber jacket and matching tapered drawstring bottoms. 

He also wore a slim-fitted white T-shirt and box white trainers.  

Michelle recently admitted she loved the lockdown period because it has given the jet-setting couple the opportunity to spend quality time together, walking their dogs, doing jigsaws and cycling near their Essex home.

The experience has also given the actress the opportunity to start writing her own material, and she has already had interest from production companies about potentially developing her projects. 

She said in a recent interview with Cosmopolitan magazine: 'We [Mark and I] were saying we'd enjoyed it. It's been nice because we've both been working from home. 

'Normally we could be out all day or I have to go to Manchester [to film Brassic] or Mark is in London. I'm taking my dogs for daily walks, I've been doing a jigsaw a week and I've taken up cycling on a proper road bike. We go out three times a week and do 11 miles!

'I'm writing two things. I've never had the time to sit down, write and research and I'm really enjoying the process. It's a comedy drama and a mini-series drama.'
