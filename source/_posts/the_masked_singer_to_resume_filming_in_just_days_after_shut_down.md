The Masked Singer is Channel Ten's addictive series that sees the judges and the public at home taking wild guesses at the identities behind the masks. 

So far, some of the stars that have been unmasked are Mark Philippoussis as The Echidna, Michael Bevan as Hammerhead, Christine Anu as Goldfish and Katie Noonan as The Sloth.
