Emma Stone and her fiance Dave McCary have been spotted wearing matching gold bands on their ring fingers as they took a walk in Los Angeles, exclusive DailyMail.com photos show. 

The actress, 31, and the SNL alum, 35, announced their engagement last December in a sweet social media post, as Stone showed off her stunning diamond and pearl ring.

They were reportedly supposed to have their wedding in mid-March, but had to call it off due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

But in May, Stone had swapped out her engagement ring for a simple gold band, leading to speculation that she and McCary had secretly tied the knot.

The couple's sighting last Friday offers even more evidence the pair may have privately exchanged vows, as they were both seen with bands on their ring fingers. 

Stone was also seen dressed in baggy overalls, as rumors swirl that the Easy A star is pregnant.
