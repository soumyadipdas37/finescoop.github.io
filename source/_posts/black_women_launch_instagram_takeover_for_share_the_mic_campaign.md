A statement from organisers released at the time read: 'Today, more than ever, it is NECESSARY that we create a unifying action to centre Black women's lives, stories, and calls to action,' the statement added. 'We need to listen to Black women.' 

'The intention of this campaign is to magnify Black women and the important work that they’re doing in order to catalyse the change that will only come when we truly hear each other’s voices.'

June Sarpong also took to her social media page and told how she was 'beyond excited' for Share the Mic UK (pictured)

'I found her inspiring then but following her career has just been beautiful to watch and I feel incredibly humbled to be sharing the mic with June.  

She continued: 'I look forward to everything she's going to post, I look forward to learning, I look forward to her educating me. I look forward to welcoming her to you guys - my community.'   

Alongside the video, she penned: 'June is an incredible broadcaster and speaker. She is the BBC’s first ever Director of Creative Diversity, is the co-founder of the network Women: Inspiration and Enterprise and has written three books – her latest,
