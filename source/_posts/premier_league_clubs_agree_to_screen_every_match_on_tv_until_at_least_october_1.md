All 20 Premier League clubs have given the green light on plans to allow all top-flight matches to be shown live on TV this season until at least October 1.

Out of the first 28 games of the 2020-21 season, 11 matches weren't due to be screened but that has changed with every match available to watch live.

The 11 outstanding games are now likely to be split between Sky Sports, BT Sport, Amazon Prime and BBC.  

Premier League clubs have given the green light to show all games on TV until October 1

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had come under pressure from supporters

The u-turn by the 20 clubs and Premier League executives follows pressure from supporters and the government to show games that are behind closed doors. 

There are plans for supporters to be allowed back into stadiums next month albeit with capacity scaled back to between 15 and 35 per cent.

But those plans are being continually reviewed and any further rise in coronavirus cases could impact how quickly more supporters are allowed back.      

The 20 Premier League clubs reportedly met on Monday to discuss the broadcasting plans

All Premier League games following last season's restart in June were shown live on television

This is the second time the 3pm Saturday blackout has been scrapped this year, as all top-flight games were shown on TV following the Premier League's return in June. 

Some games were shown on free-to-air channels, including four on the BBC, with others on Sky One and Sky's Pick channel.  

So far, TV picks have only been made for the opening three matches of the 2020-21 Premier League season.
