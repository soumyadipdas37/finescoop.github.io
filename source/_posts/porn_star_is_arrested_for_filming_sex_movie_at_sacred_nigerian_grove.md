A porn star has been arrested for filming a 'sex movie' at a sacred Nigerian forest which is said to be the home of a fertility goddess. 

Tobiloba Jolaosho, known in the Nigerian adult film industry as King Tblak HOC, has been arrested for allegedly recording a 'sex movie' at Osun Osogbo - a UN-designated World Heritage Site on the outskirts of the city of Osugbo.

The Yoruba people come to the grove from across Nigeria to offer sacrifices to their fertility goddess, Osun.   

Mr Jolaosho, a popular adult movie producer, uploaded the clip to his social media accounts and website. In the scene, Mr Jolaosho is allegedly dressed in a white robe, which is usually worn by the goddess's followers, the BBC reported.

Police spokesman Opalola Yemisi told BBC Yoruba the movie producer's behaviour   'could have breached public peace' and that he will appear in court after an investigation is concluded. 

Yemi Elebuibon, an Osun adherent, said that Mr Jolaosho had desecrated the sacred forest. 

Mr Elebuibon added that the traditional worshippers in charge of the grove will decide what additional punishment Mr Jolaosho deserves after the police have finished their investigation. 

Neither Mr Jolaosho nor his lawyer have commented on the case. 

UNESCO describes the sacred grove as 'dotted with sanctuaries and shrines, sculptues and art works in honour of Osun and other deities'.

'The sacred grove, which is now seen as a symbol of identity for all Yoruba people, is probably the last in Yoruba culture,' it adds.  

According to Yoruba mythology, Osun was one of the three wives of Shango, a powerful axe-wielding deity in the Yoruba tradition.      

Thousands of people attend the two-week Osun Osogbo festival each year, where followers dance, sing, play drums and dress in colourful costumes to please the goddess. 

The celebrations attract worshippers from across Nigeria and the rest of the world. 

Yoruba followers say the Osun Osogbo forest is one of the few places that spirits still reveal themselves to bless adherents.
