Steve Irwin died in September 2006 at the age of 44 after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming a wildlife documentary in Batt Reef, Queensland. 

On his 14th anniversary on Friday, the daughter of the late 'Crocodile Hunter', Bindi Irwin, was pictured at Caloundra Airport, Queensland with husband Chandler Powell.

The 22-year-old, who recently announced her pregnancy news with Chandler, concealed her baby bump in her signature khaki button-up shirt and trousers.
