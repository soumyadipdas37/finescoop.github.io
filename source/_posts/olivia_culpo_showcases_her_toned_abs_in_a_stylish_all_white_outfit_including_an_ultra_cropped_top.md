She recently spoke candidly about her personal struggle with endometriosis, a disorder in which the uterine lining grows outside of the uterus. 

But Olivia Culpo seemed to be in good spirits on Monday as she flaunted her toned figure in a chic white ensemble. 

The 28-year-old model posed in her kitchen wearing an ultra cropped white top and matching shorts as she shared the photo to Instagram.

She wrapped herself in a long off-white cardigan, that revealed one shoulder and her toned abs. 

The former Miss Universe put on a glamorous look with a flawless complexion featuring contoured cheekbones, and a highlighted nose. 

Her pout was done in a light pink color and seemed to be paired to her eyes with a blush contour shade and a black winged liner. 

She used one hand to play with her hair that was down, parted in the middle, and in tousled curls. 

Opening up: Her post comes just days after she opened up about her endometriosis diagnosis on social media 

Her post comes just days after she opened up about her diagnosis on social media. 

'I've never publicly said this before, but I have endometriosis. Aka the most excruciatingly painful cramps/periods,' she said on her Instagram story last week. 

After learning that many of her followers also suffer from the painful disorder, Culpo returned to the platform to elaborate on her coping mechanisms, as well as her aversion to surgery.

Painful: 'I've never publicly said this before, but I have endometriosis. Aka the most excruciatingly painful cramps/periods,' revealed the 28-year-old model on her Instagram Story

'It's so not fun. Very painful. There is obviously a surgery you can get for it that I don't really want to get, but [I use] lots of heating pads, [drink] lots of water, and [take] lots of Midol,' she revealed.

She also encouraged women who think they may be dealing with endometriosis to 'do [their] research and due diligence' by seeking help from a medical professional.

'If you are having very painful periods or you are not being diagnosed with what you think COULD be endometriosis, definitely do your research.

'Because if you don't discover that you have this it could get in the way of fertility, you can have tissue growing in areas that you really shouldn't have it, which could interfere with getting pregnant someday,' explained the former Miss Universe.

'Definitely go to your doctor if you have painful periods. Painful periods are not normal. You just want to make sure that everything is ok. If you do want to get pregnant, you just never know. You don't want to wait too late.'

She then tagged her personal OB-GYN Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, who also happens to treat numerous members of the Kardashian-Jenner family.
