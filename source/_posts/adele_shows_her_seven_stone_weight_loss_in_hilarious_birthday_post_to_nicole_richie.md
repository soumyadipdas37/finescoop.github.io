Adele is said to have lost a staggering seven stone due to a 1,000 calorie a day diet and upping her exercise, and she showed off her dramatic transformation on her 32nd birthday.

Since unveiling her new look on her 32nd birthday, displaying her incredible lithe frame, the songstress has been showered with attention by fans and fellow celebs.  

The singer has become increasingly health-conscious over recent months and a source close to the star praised her disciplined approach to her own well-being.

An insider previously told E! News: 'She goes to different gyms. She goes early in the morning and meets with her trainer.

'She gets her workout in first thing. She works out for about an hour and leaves drenched in sweat and looking like she worked very hard.'

Friends: The series of snaps showed that the pair have been close friends for quite some time

Adele's post comes days after she and her rumoured love interest Skepta enjoyed a fun-filled night on the town, at a virtual reality centre in east London on Tuesday. 

Having returned to the capital from her £7.7million Beverly Hills home, the Hello songstress was said to be putting on such a raucous display with the Boy Better Know star, who turned 38 last Saturday, at the futuristic venue. 

The 'couple', who were joined by MC Jammer, were spotted at OTHERWORLD, an 'innovative social entertainment concept using unique, multi-sensory virtual reality technology', which is held in a converted railway arch in a backstreet in Haggerston.

Insiders told MailOnline: 'We were asked to move from the lounge because a VIP was arriving. I couldn’t believe it when Adele just walked in with Skepta and Jammer...

'After doing the VR I saw her chatting to people and putting her boots back on. She seemed really down to earth. They were screaming and laughing when they were doing the VR together, I could hear her from the other end of the venue....

'It looked like they had a lot of fun together.'

The venue charges from £12 for a 40 minute session, up to £44 for an hour and 10 minute session per person, while drinks range from £2.00 for half a pint of Stiegl Radler to a bottle of champagne - the brand of which is unlisted - for £135.00. 

The Grammy-winning singer and the rapper were first linked to in October last year after it had emerged that Adele's marriage to Simon Konecki had broken down.

Rumours swirled in March that Skepta, real name Joseph Junior Adenuga, confirmed that things are now over between himself and Adele in a new track, Mic Check, from his album, Insomnia.

In the track, he rapped: 'Can you handle the fame? You know you’re f***ing with a star? When you’re f***ing with me, they talk about you in the Press.'

As well as being linked with Adele, Skepta has been reportedly dating supermodel Naomi Campbell, 49, for a few months up until April 2018.
