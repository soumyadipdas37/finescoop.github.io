She's been glamming up every day for her commute into work.

And Myleene Klass once again proved her sartorial credentials as she headed into work at the Global Radio studios in central London for her Smooth Radio mid-morning show on Friday. 

The former pop star, 42, looked like she had come straight from St Tropez as she sported a low-cut black maxi dress that hugged her enviable figure.

Myleene matched her summery gown with a large black-ribboned sun hat and oversized sunglasses. 

The former Hear'Say singer accessorised with her favourite giant hoop earrings and a boho-style crescent moon necklace. 

She carried her essentials in a quilted black leather Chanel backpack, while stiletto sandals hidden beneath her dress added height to her frame. 

Myleene's cheery appearance came after her recent social media run-in with a troll who claimed her boyfriend Simon Motson will cheat on her.

The classically-trained pianist recently posted a gallery of sweet images with the PR executive boyfriend, 45, to celebrate five years since they had met.

But a troll wrote underneath: 'Not long before this one cheats on you. Dear oh dear, heading for the lawyers are we?'

In a pointed response, she fired back: 'He wishes! Cheating exes usually get a house, a car and a fat pay-off', in what appeared to be a dig at her ex-husband Graham Quinn, who left her on her 34th birthday in 2012.  

The heartbreaking incident came just six months after the couple's wedding, but they had been together for 11 years at the time, after meeting when Graham became the bodyguard for Myleene's pop group Hear'Say in 2001.

Myleene was devastated to learn that he had secretly bought a bachelor pad for himself – meaning he must have been planning his departure for some time.

The former couple are parents to two daughters, Ava, 13, and Hero, nine. 

Myleene is now in a happy relationship with PR executive Simon, who she began dating in 2015 after being introduced by two mutual friends.

They welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, in August last year.

Simon has two children, a son and a daughter the same age as Myleene's girls, from his previous marriage.
