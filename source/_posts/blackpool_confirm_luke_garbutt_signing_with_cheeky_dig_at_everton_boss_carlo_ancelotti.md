Blackpool have confirmed the signing of former Everton defender Luke Garbutt with a cheeky dig at Toffees boss Carlo Ancelotti.

Garbutt was released by Everton in June but when asked about the left-back's departure, Ancelotti admitted he didn't know who he was.

The 27-year-old joined Everton back in 2009 but only made 12 first team appearances for the club and had loan spells at seven different clubs.

Blackpool have now taken the opportunity to poke fun at Ancelotti's gaffe with a light-hearted post on Twitter shortly after confirming his arrival.

The tweet shows Ancelotti's confused face during a Zoom interview back in June which has gone down well with the club's supporters. 

At the time, Garbutt saw the funny side of the Italian's error, tweeting: 'It's not his fault, it's the club's, however it's a belter tho!'

After announcing his arrival at Bloomfield Road, Garbutt revealed his desire to help the club return to the Championship.

He said; ' I'm pleased to be here at Blackpool and to get back playing football again. Me and the gaffer spoke last week and I really liked what he had to say.

'Hopefully we can push on and have a successful season.'

Blackpool have won one and lost one of their opening two League One games after finishing 13th last season.
