She announced her semi-retirement from the public relations industry in July, after losing many of her clients during the COVID-19 recession.

But on Tuesday, PR mogul Roxy Jacenko revealed her very surprising next career move.

The 40-year-old mother-of-two announced on Instagram she was becoming a 'teacher'.

'Who knew I would become a teacher!' On Tuesday, PR mogul Roxy Jacenko (pictured)  revealed her shock new career after 'semi-retiring' three months ago due to losing many of her clients during the COVID-19 recession

Roxy shared a behind-the-scenes image of herself sitting in a chair with a laptop while she filmed a video.

'Today. Who knew I would become a teacher!!!' she captioned the fun photo.

Roxy looked sensational in a pair of jeans, which flaunted her trim pins and a smart navy blazer.

Sharing her experience! The successful businesswoman revealed she was sharing her many years of experience by putting together an online four-week marketing Boot Camp course. 

She wore her blonde locks pulled back in a ponytail and glamorous makeup, with a full coverage foundation, touch of blush and a soft pink lip as she cheekily poked her tongue out at the camera.

The successful businesswoman then revealed she was sharing her many years of experience by putting together an online four-week marketing Boot Camp course.

'You asked so it’s coming,' she added.

Stepping back: The new venture comes after Roxy revealed in July that losing '85 per cent' of her clients due to COVID-19 made her reassess her job at PR Firm Sweaty Betty

The new venture comes after Roxy revealed in July that losing '85 per cent' of her clients due to COVID-19 made her reassess her job at PR Firm Sweaty Betty. 

'It's been a realisation for me. I hated my job. I didn't like what I was doing,' she said on The Kyle and Jackie O Show. 

'I'm now semi-retired,' she added, explaining that she wanted to focus on her family. 

Family time: Semi-retirement meant Roxy has been able to spend more time with her husband, Oliver Curtis, and their children, Pixie, eight, and Hunter, six 

However, Roxy has managed to keep busy launching a new business with her long-time friend, Ingham’s Chicken heiress Jessica Ingham, earlier this month.

The entrepreneurial pair have created an event brand called XRJ Celebrations, which will create fun and unique table settings and centrepieces for parties.

And, the mother of two is set to star on Channel Seven's upcoming reality series SAS Australia, which sees celebrities undergo rigorous SAS training reserved for the country's elite special forces.
