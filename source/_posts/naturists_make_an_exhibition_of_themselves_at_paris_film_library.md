Naturists flocked to Paris's film library today wearing nothing but face masks to attend an exhibition celebrating a renowned French comedian.

The group were photographed frolicking down the halls of Cinémathèque Française in the French capital in a special ticketed event on Sunday. 

Members of French group l’Association des Naturistes de Paris were viewing an exhibition dedicated to actor and comedian Louis de Funès who performed in more than 230 roles across film and stage.

De Funès - widely dubbed France's favourite actor - starred as gendarme Ludovic Cruchot in 1964 French comedy film The Troops of St Tropez.

In the movie, Cruchot - having recently arrived in St Tropez to carry out his duties - tries to stop a group of nude swimmers who continue to evade capture. Eventually, the uptight officer is able to arrest the persistent bunch.

Nudists visiting today's exhibition posed alongside a statue of Cruchot from the film, while others were photographed inspecting the exhibits and skipping down corridors.
