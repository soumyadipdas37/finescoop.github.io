Pete Evan's wife Nicola Robinson is rarely-seen in public, instead spending most of her days holed up at the couple's $1.2 million farm in northern NSW.

But on Thursday, the former Playboy model, 42, stepped out to purchase items from a local supermarket in Byron Bay.

Nicola cut a casual figure in a sheer white blouse and black tight pants as she visited the shops after leaving her husband's Evolve Health Labs clinic.

The Kiwi-born beauty appeared to go makeup free for the outing, and styled her long brunette locks out.

She completed her outfit with a pair of sneakers and held a tote bag on her shoulder while holding a basket in her other hand.

Before entering the shops, Nicola was spotted standing outside on the footpath and glancing at her mobile phone.

Nicola is believed to be working at Pete's Byron Bay Evolve Health Labs clinic, which offers 'transformational practices' such as 'cold and conscious breath-work'.

Nicola, who describes herself as 'moon gazing farm girl' and 'nutritional mermaid', has raised eyebrows in recent years with her unusual beliefs about health and spirituality.

She also received media attention in 2017, when she went under the knife to have her 'toxic' breast implants removed.

Meanwhile, Pete has also been embroiled in a string of controversies since departing Channel Seven earlier this year.

He was recently invited on 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network. 

Despite sharing misleading information about immunisation over the years, Pete has insisted he is not an 'anti-vaxxer' but 'pro-choice for medical freedom'.

However, there is no such thing as being 'pro-choice' regarding vaccinations. People who do not vaccinate their children are putting the community at unnecessary risk.

Pete has claimed on several occasions that vaccines cause autism, but this is false and based on a scientific paper that was later exposed as fraudulent. 

Nicola and Pete began dating in 2012, and married in a barefoot wedding ceremony on their picturesque property near Round Mountain in 2016.
