Prince Harry today said he had been 'awakened' to the issue of racial discrimination by marrying Meghan Markle as the couple called on Britain to 'end structural racism' in an interview to mark the start of Black History Month. 

The royal spoke of how the UK could be made a better country if white people knew what it was like for people 'of a different coloured skin', as he weighed into the Diversity dance row by saying he was 'surprised' by the criticism it received.  

Speaking in a Zoom interview with the Evening Standard from their new £11million home in Santa Barbara, California, the couple said they were 'doing well' after leaving the UK and breaking away from the Royal Family. 

Prince Harry said he had spoken to Diversity leader Ashley Banjo to offer his support after the troupe's Black Lives Matter themed dance on Britain's Got Talent sparked 24,500 to Ofcom. 

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex called for an end to structural racism in Britain in an interview today with the Evening Standard 

He said: 'We had such a good chat with Ashley. He was really strong, he felt great about it, but at the same time he was concerned because of the reaction. It was a real surprise that there was what? 

'1,100 complaints after the show and then three days of hype it became 20 or 25,000. I am very glad Ofcom made the decision that they did but that in itself kind of proves how much this conversation needs to continue.'

Harry, 36, said he had become more aware of the issue of racism after marrying his wife, 39. 

He said: 'Because I wasn't aware of so many of the issues and so many of the problems within the UK and also globally as well. I thought I did but I didn't.'

He added: 'You know, when you go in to a shop with your children and you only see white dolls, do you even think: 'That's weird, there is not a black doll there?'.'

The interview also saw the Duchess of Sussex comment on the sometimes violent Black Lives Matter protests in the US after the death of George Floyd. 

She admitted the demonstrations could be 'inflammatory' but that - when peaceful - they were a 'beautiful thing'.   

Last week, the Duke and Duchess were accused of 'over-stepping the line' after a thinly-veiled swipe at Donald Trump as they urged Americans to get out and vote in the upcoming election.

In the couple's most high-profile intervention in the US presidential election, Harry urged voters to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity' – all qualities critics associate with Mr Trump.

In a TV appearance to mark Time magazine's 100 most influential people roll call, Meghan – who has made no secret of her antipathy towards the president – described November's vote as the most important election of her lifetime.

Meanwhile, Harry complained that he had never been able to exercise his democratic right to vote because of the convention that, as a member of the British Royal Family, he should remain politically neutral.
