She has been dating personal trainer Joe Davies since December.

And Faye Brookes put on a leggy display as she stepped out in black denim shorts following her hair appointment at Terence Paul in Hale, Cheshire, on Tuesday. 

The former Coronation Street star, 32, cut a casual figure in the high-waisted shorts which highlighted her toned pins while she flaunted her new glossy hair extensions.

Faye paired her shorts with a pinstripe white shirt which she tied in a knot to cinch in her waist.

The actress carried a takeaway coffee cup as she strutted along the pavement in thick-soled white trainers. 

Keeping all eyes on her tresses, Faye opted for a bouncy blow dry styled in a side parting.

The beauty kept her makeup to a minimum and opted for a dash of bronzer over her cheekbones as she took a phone call on-the-go. 

Finishing her look, a radiant Faye carried her everyday essentials in a taupe crossbody bag and wore black shades.  

Faye revealed on her Instagram that she had Salt Club hair extensions which are described as 'ethically sourced' and 'plastic free'.
