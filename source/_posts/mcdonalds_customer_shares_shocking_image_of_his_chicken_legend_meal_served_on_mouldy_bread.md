A frustrated McDonald's customer has shared shocking images of a Chicken Legend burger served in mouldy bread, which he claims made him feel immediately sick.

The customer, a 25-year-old bank clerk from London, headed into the Warren Street branch of the fast food chain last week in his lunch break to pick up a £5.59 meal to eat at his desk.

He took a bite from the sandwich and soon noticed something was wrong, and then saw the mould on the bread. 

Footage shows how the bank worker returned to the restaurant to confront staff, but he claims that a week after being told to contact customer services, he's received no response. 

FEMAIL has contacted McDonald's for comment.

The bank clerk, who asked not to be named, told FEMAIL: 'I was on my lunch break and ordered a Chicken Legend from the self-service kiosk.

'I went back to work, sat down and took from the burger, that's when I noticed it looked a bit odd. 

'I asked one of my colleagues '"What's wrong with my burger?" and he replied "You've got a mouldy burger".'

Frustrated, he went back to the store and asked to speak to the manager who urged him to get in contact with the company online, but a week later he still hasn't heard anything back.

The one bite of the mouldy bread made the bank clerk feel sick, and he's contacted his GP as a result.  

'I went back to the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager. When the person at the till saw the burger was mouldy the manager came running out the back.

'I showed him the mouldy burger, explained that the burger was purchased today at 2:23pm and I had eaten it by 2:28pm and returned to the store by 2:33pm for the manager to state to me in a video that there are problems with freshly made orders,' he explained.

The stamp on the burger says it was 'freshly made to order' at 2.23 on August 26. Despite his immediate complaint the customer still has not received a reply

'McDonald's has a system where multiple people would have seen the burger before it was given to me which makes think that they relabel their expired food.

'The manager asked me to get in touch online. I went to the website, and tried to call customer service but they didn't take inbound calls,' he claimed. 

'I haven't been contacted by anyone since contacting them online,' he added.
