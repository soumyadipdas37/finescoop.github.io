A woman has been branded a genius after sharing a simple hack for revitalising old carrots.  

Lottie Dalziel, from Sydney, Australia shared a clip to TikTok where she put a carrot in a glass of water for five minutes.

In the video, which has racked up more than a million views, Lottie says that carrots are often dehydrated and simple need water to bring back their snap.

 'Pop them in some water for five minutes – yes, this does work – pull them out and they will be as good as gold!' she explains. 

She then showed the carrot with was bendy and flopping over. 

After soaking in a jar of water for five minutes, the carrot was edible again.

While many were shocked with the result, some questions how accurate it was. 

In the video, which has racked up more than a million views, Lottie says that carrots are often dehydrated and simple need water to bring back their snap.

Some TikTok users explained it worked due to osmosis, meaning the water from the jar is absorbed into saltier parts of the carrot.

'This is genius,' said one.

'Wow you changed my life!' commented another. 

However, others were more dubious saying it doesn't work at the food should be thrown out.

'Give it to an animal instead,' said one.

Another wrote: 'It does work! Sometimes it helps to peel them a little bit first.'

While one commented: 'Does work but after a few hours.'

Others sheared their own tips, including  one who said: 'I store mine in water in the fridge. I change the water once a week and they last for ages, same with celery!'.
