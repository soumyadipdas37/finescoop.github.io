Stradivarius finished second in the Prix Foy at Longchamp but still got a pass mark from trainer John Gosden in his prep race for next month’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe.

The three-time Ascot Gold Cup winner was beaten a short neck by Aidan O’Brien’s Anthony Van Dyck as the race turned into a 500metre burn-up.

The mile-and-a-half Prix Foy was run in a time eight-and-a-half seconds slower than the Grand Prix de Paris won by O’Brien’s Mogul.

Stradivarius is likely to face a stronger pace and more stamina-sapping conditions on October 4. 

And Gosden confirmed the intention was still for the colt to join stablemate Enable in the Arc.

Gosden said: ‘It was a stroll in the park and then a sprint. He has run a very nice trial.

‘I don’t think Frankie (Dettori) wanted to go out in front. He wanted a feel of the track. I thought his last furlong was his best furlong and he ran out of real estate in the end.’
