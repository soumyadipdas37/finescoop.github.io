It's fair to say disgraced former senator Sam Dastyari has made a few mistakes during his years as a politician and pundit.

And the 37-year-old, known as 'Shanghai Sam' for his involvement in a Chinese donations scandal which eventually led to his resignation in January 2018, made a rather awkward gaffe on the Today show on Tuesday.

During a hot topics segment with host Karl Stefanovic and journalist Anna Caldwell, Sam put his foot in it while discussing a viral news story about a cheating husband.  

Whoops! Sam Dastyari (left, with Karl Stefanovic and Anna Caldwell) made a rather awkward gaffe on the Today show on Tuesday

Karl began: 'How's this for a wife's revenge - forcing her cheating husband to parade around their neighbourhood dressed in pink as a brutal get-back. Sam?'

Sam replied: 'Well, look, firstly as someone who's gone through a divorce, I can safely say that's not something I was forced to do.

'And I don't think you were either, Karl.'

Careful what you say! During a hot topics segment, Sam put his foot in it while discussing a viral news story about a cheating husband who was forced by his wife to wear prissy pink and cycle around his neighbourhood as a punishment

Perhaps realising what he had just suggested about himself and Karl on national TV, Sam laughed nervously and tried to find a way to wrap things up.

'I mean, look, it's not going to work, it's not going to end well if that's how you're going to try and make your relationship work, good luck to you.... by the way, I thought wearing pink was okay?' he said.

Karl sternly clarified: 'I guess if you're a cheater, Sam.'

He said what?! 'Well, look, firstly as someone who's gone through a divorce, I can safely say that's not something I was forced to do,' said Sam. 'And I don't think you were either, Karl'

'Well, look, I mean that's certainly not me but, er, but look I think...' Sam responded, before bursting into awkward laughter.

Karl, 46, brushed off Sam's gaffe, and later told him and Anna: 'I thought you guys would be much lighter on that one. You guys took it very seriously. Anyway, onwards and upwards!'

'Too many scars there, Karl. Too many scars!' Sam added, signing off.

Oh, dear! Perhaps realising what he had just suggested about himself and Karl on national TV, Sam laughed nervously and tried to find a way to wrap things up

Sam was only joking of course, and Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting that either he or Karl has been unfaithful in the past.

Former Labor senator Sam clarified in January last year that his split from his wife of eight years, Helen ­Barron, was 'very amicable'.

Karl has also made it clear that he did not meet his now-wife, Jasmine Yarbrough, until five months after he'd split from his first wife, Cassandra Thorburn, in mid-2016.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Nine for comment. 

The truth: Karl has made it clear that he did not meet his now-wife, Jasmine Yarbrough, until five months after he'd split from his first wife, Cassandra Thorburn, in mid-2016
