Yolanda was previously married to songwriter David Foster for six years before the pair split in 2017. He is now re-married to singer Katharine McPhee. 

Before that she was married to real estate developer Mohamed Hadid with whom she shares her three children. The pair ended things in 2000. 

Goat garden: On her farm Yolanda has virtually every farm animal from horses to goats to ducks and chickens

Yolanda has been living a blissful life on her 32 acre farm since she bought the property in 2017. The mother of three has been very open about her struggles with Lyme Disease and has taken to the east coast for a chiller way of life.

The farm - which is just an hour and a half from NYC where all of her kids reside - has been a home base for the family, especially in quarantine. 

Bella and Gigi spent the majority of the past six months at the farm, documenting their time with the animals and as a family while Gigi has been expecting her first child with longtime love Zayn Malik. 

Anwar spent a lot of time with girlfriend Dua in the UK during quarantine before the two popped back to the US to be together as a family before returning to NYC.
