A 4WD driver could face ten years in jail after he was charged over a horror family holiday car crash. 

Emergency services were called after a 4WD towing a camper trailer hit a sedan in Nowendoc, in the NSW Northern Tablelands, at 12.20pm on Saturday.    

NSW Police will allege the 42-year-old man 'veered onto the wrong side of the road' and caused the death of a 72-year-old woman and a four-year-old girl - who had been in his own car.       

A family's 4WD collided with a sedan on Thunderbolts way (pictured) at Nowendoc in the New South Wales Northern Tablelands at around 12.20pm on Saturday

The 72-year-old woman driving the sedan died at the scene and a four-year-old passenger from the 4WD was rushed to hospital (John Hunter Hospital pictured) but died on arrival 

The 72-year-old woman was the sole occupant of the sedan and died at the scene.   

The four-year-old girl, a passenger in the 4WD, was treated for critical injuries at the scene before being airlifted to hospital. 

She was pronounced dead on arrival at the John Hunter Hospital despite the best efforts of NSW Ambulance paramedics.  

The 42-year-old driver was treated for minor injuries before he was taken to the same hospital for mandatory testing. 

His other passengers, a 34-year-old woman, two boys, aged nine and 12, and a two-year-old girl were also taken to the hospital and treated for fractures, abrasions and stomach injuries. 

Specialist police from the crash investigation unit launched an investigation to determine the cause of the crash. 

The 42-year-old driver attended Newcastle Police Station after inquiries and was arrested on Tuesday. 

He was charged with nine offences including dangerous driving occasioning death, negligent driving occasioning death and not keeping left of the dividing line.   

The maximum penalty for drivers charged with dangerous driving occasioning death is ten years imprisonment. 

The 42-year-old was granted conditional bail and set to appear at Tamworth Local Court on October 19.
