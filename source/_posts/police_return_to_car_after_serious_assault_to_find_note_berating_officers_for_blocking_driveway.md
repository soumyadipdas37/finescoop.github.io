When police returned to their car, they saw a note under the windscreen wiper from a resident. 

It read: 'This is private property NOT a parking space!!' 

Telford Police shared a photo of the note left on the car last night on Twitter and said: 'While dealing with a serious incident along with @OFFICIALWMAS we found this sign left on 1 of the 7 police cars at the scene. 

@TelfordCops shared a picture of the note on Twitter last night, explaining they would never intentionally block a drive unless it's an absolute emergency

'Please be assured that we will never intentionally block a drive or property unless it is an absolute emergency, like this was.' 

In response to another user, they added: 'Air ambulance was in attendance as well, very much a serious incident. 

'We never intentionally block driveways, but sometimes the situation means we can't waste life saving seconds parking up nicely.'  

In a statement, West Mercia Police said: 'Police were called to Sutton Hill in Telford at around 6.15pm yesterday (Wednesday 2 September) after a man suffered serious injuries to his neck. 

'He was taken to Royal Stoke Hospital by air ambulance where he remains in a stable condition.
