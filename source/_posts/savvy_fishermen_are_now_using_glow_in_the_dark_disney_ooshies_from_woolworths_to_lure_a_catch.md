An Australian fisherman has used the Woolworths Disney+ glow in the dark Ooshies as lures to catch fish.

Mark Pace said the popular collectable toys worked well at attracting the fish to the bait, and now he's seeking to buy more second-hand Ooshies on social media.

'Anyone have any glow in the dark Ooshies they don't want? Happy to pay $1 each,' he said on Facebook.

The novel idea quickly caught the attention of thousands online, and Mark's post received more than 2,600 comments. 

While some thought the idea was clever, others were outraged as the plastic figurines could pollute the ocean if lost or might choke the fish if it gets away.

'This is kinda cool, but [the] plastic [will] end up in fish if they get away,' one person said.

'Sorry but this is a really bad idea … we have enormous amounts of plastic in our oceans destroying them,' another said.

A third added: 'There's already too much plastic in our oceans.'  

'Good idea as long as they don’t come off the line and become more plastic in the oceans,' a fourth said.

Others who go fishing often said using Ooshies is no different to using soft plastic fish lures.  

Despite his efforts to seek more glow in the dark Ooshies, Mark told Daily Mail Australia he's had no luck obtaining any more for fishing. 

'It's gone crazy,' he said, as his images and idea have spread across Facebook. 

The Woolworths Disney+ Ooshies promotion returned in stores on August 26, but was cut short four weeks early and concluded in late September.

Following the announcement, dozens of furious customers around the country reported on Facebook they can no longer redeem the figurines, with some even vowing to never shop at the supermarket again. 

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, a Woolworths spokesman said: 'Our Disney+ Ooshies have proven extraordinarily popular with customers, to the point we had to conclude the program early due to customers collecting the last of our stock.

'These collectibles take more than 12 months to plan and the quantity produced is based on our experience of running many collectible campaigns that we've previously offered.

'We attribute much of the success of our Disney+ Ooshies to customers of all ages connecting with the Disney+ universes, across Marvel, Star Wars, Disney, and Pixar, there was a character for all types of Disney+ fans to collect and enjoy.

'To our customers, we thank you for your excitement and engagement with the Disney+ Ooshies and apologise for any frustration or disappointment caused by running out of stock.'
