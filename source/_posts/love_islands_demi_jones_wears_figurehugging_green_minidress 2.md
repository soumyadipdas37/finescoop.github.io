Demi Jones wowed as she headed on a night out on Bank Holiday Monday in a gorgeous jade green ensemble.

Clearly recognising she looked stunning, Demi, 22, captioned a pair of snaps she posted to Instagram with the tag line: 'I think green might be my colour!'

And indeed, it was - with the figure-hugging number clinching her waist and showcasing her leggy pins.

Demi smouldered for the snaps in the dress, which featured a very busty, deeply-plunging front and a semi-sheer high-hemmed skirt.

The bottom half of the look featured sparkling lace detailing and showed off the tops of her long legs.

She added nude strap heels and matched these with a purse in the same colour and a freshly painted manicure and pedicure.

She wore her fiery red mane in tumbling locks around her bare shoulders and pouted for the photo, displaying a natural wash of make-up.

Its been a wild weekend for the Love Island starlet - who soared to fame earlier this year on the winter series of the hit ITV2 dating show.

 On Sunday, the Love Island 2020 girls enjoyed a fun reunion to celebrate the August Bank Holiday.

Demi went out on the town with Shaughna Phillips, Sophie Piper, twins Eve and Jess Gale, and Leanne Amaning, seen out and about in London.

It comes after Love Island bosses announced a new dating series called The Cabins, after they had to scrap the summer and winter editions of the show due to the COVID-19 crisis.

The channel announced on Thursday that they are set to launch a brand new format which will see singletons stay the night in a cabin in the middle of nowhere in the UK with potential suitors. 

During the show, the couples will face 24 hours without a smartphone in a bid to truly connect with their date.   

Speaking about the new show, Paul Mortimer, ITV's Head of Digital Channels and Acquisitions, said: 'This is a fantastic new format which challenges young people to delete the apps and attempt to date face to face, with no distractions.

'We're thrilled to be bringing this show to ITV2 viewers who will have front row seats, eavesdropping on our couples as they attempt to find true love.'

While Michael Mannes, who heads up production company 12 Yard who are making the reality show, added: 'We are delighted ITV2 have commissioned the series and can't wait to get into full production on what we hope will be a big hit with this exciting new twist on the reality dating format.'

Speaking of the show with The Sun, a source claimed: 'After 24 hours together they will be able to decide whether they stay together for a bit longer, or move on to someone new.

Exciting: It comes after Love Island bosses announced a new dating series called The Cabins, after they had to scrap the summer and winter editions of the show due to the COVID-19 crisis

'If they remain as a couple for up to four days, we then give some other singles the chance to enter the cabin and potentially meet their Mr or Miss Right.' 

On when the show will hit screens, the source added: 'They'll start filming in the next few months as they're casting now and it will air in the new year.'

The decision to scrap the summer and winter editions of Love Island came amid ongoing uncertainty relating to the coronavirus pandemic.

Pre-production on the winter 2021 series was due to take place this summer, but due to social distancing measures, the series proved to be impossible to stage.

Kevin Lygo, ITV's director of television, previously conceded it simply wasn't possible to shoot the summer edition of the show in the midst of the health crisis. 

The first-ever winter Love Island was won by Paige Turley and Finn Tapp and aired in January. 

Love Island is currently hosted by Laura Whitmore, following the tragic death of presenter Caroline Flack on February 15.
