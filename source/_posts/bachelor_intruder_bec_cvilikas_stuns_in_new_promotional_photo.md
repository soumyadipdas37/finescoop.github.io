She is set to shake things up on The Bachelor this week as she enters the show as an intruder.

And it is easy to see why stunning Sunshine Coast beauty Bec Cvilikas leaves Locky Gilbert and the other girls seething when she is introduced via Zoom on Wednesday night.

The 25-year-old stuns, showing off her slender figure and angelic good looks in a promotional image posted on her Instagram page.

No wonder they are threatened! New Bachelor intruder Bec Cvilikas stuns in promotional photo as she is dubbed 'the most beautiful person to ever be on the show'

Bec, who is lives in Sydney but hails from QLD wears a flirty wrap around top in the photo that shows off a hint of her toned torso.

Thought I’d pop in and see what all the fuss is about ���� Catch me 7.30 tonight on #thebachelorau on @channel10au,' she wrote in the caption.

According to Bec, the blonde beauty instantly shares intense chemistry with Locky. 

'The second Locky and I connected on the screen, there was this instant spark. You couldn't have wiped the smile off our faces if you tried!' Bec told TV Week this week.

'Some of the girls are definitely taken aback by how strong our connection is in such a short time I mean, even I am!' she continued.

Bec describes herself as 'a bit of a tomboy' having played rugby for years.

'I don't know if the other girls are jealous, but if it was the other way around, I'd be feeling protective over my connection as well,' she added.

In a teaser trailer for this week's episodes, host Osher Günsberg tells the remaining ladies another woman has entered the competition via video link.

'She's frickin amazing!' an excited Locky gushes in a piece-to-camera. 'All the boxes are being ticked.'

But while Bachelor Locky is thrilled about the new arrival, fellow suitor Izzy Sharman-Firth describes the newcomer as a 'kick in the d**k'.
