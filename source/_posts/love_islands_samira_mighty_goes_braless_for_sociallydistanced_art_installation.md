Samira Mighty turned up the heat as she took part in a socially distanced installation at London's Alexandra Palace in the UK's first major participatory work of art since lockdown on Wednesday.

Catching the eye, the Love Island star, 23, went braless underneath a leather biker jacket while sporting a protective face mask amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The bold installation by renowned artist Spencer Tunick, titled Everyone Together, was supported by Sky Arts to mark the channel becoming free for everyone to watch.

The theatre star maintained her racy display by teaming her outerwear with just a pair of black briefs.

With her tresses scraped back into a ponytail, the influencer opted for neutral-toned make-up to bring out her naturally stunning features.

Boasting a background in performing arts, the musician explained the project in a post shared to Instagram: 'As you guys know, I'm big on performing having been in the West End, so I'm really excited that from today #skyarts is gonna be free for all to enjoy! 

'To celebrate, I took my kit off (yes, really!!!) along with 200 other people for a socially-distanced human artwork called Everyone Together by Spencer Tunick.

'The picture shows the power of coming together, and the freedom of the human form. It was a mega liberating experience - although very cold!!!' (sic). 

Samira is believed to be single after calling it quits from her boyfriend Alex Dean following a 14-month relationship.

According to sources, the reality star and the Ibiza Weekender personality split before the UK's coronavirus lockdown in late March. 

An insider told The Sun: 'They haven't been together in a long time.'

During her time on Love Island in 2018, Samira coupled up with latecomer Frankie Foster. 

While she left the villa to be with the hunk, they later split amid cheating allegations on his part.

Her relationship with Alex came as a nice surprise for the brunette beauty following her unlucky-in-love stint, with the pair often sharing smitten pictures on Instagram.
