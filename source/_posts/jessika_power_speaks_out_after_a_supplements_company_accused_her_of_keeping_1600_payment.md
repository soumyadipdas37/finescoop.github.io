Jessika Power has defended herself after a supplements company claimed she was paid $1,600 for a sponsored post which never materialised, before then cutting off communication with them.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, the 27-year-old former Married At First Sight star claimed she'd told the company she was unwell and intended to return the money in two weeks' time.

'I'm really, really sick. I'm in and out of surgery at the moment. The medicine I'm on makes me really sick. I've been vomiting, I'm bed-bound, I haven't even been going to college because of it,' she said.

Speaking out: Jessika Power (pictured) has defended herself after a supplements company claimed she was paid $1,600 for a sponsored post which never materialised, before then cutting off communication with them

'I let them know that [I'm sick]. I told them, "Look, I'm actually really, really sick. I'm really sorry that this has happened,"' she added.

'I said, "At the moment, I'm unable to pay back the agreement, but it will be paid to you in two weeks."'

Jessika, who did not disclose the nature of her illness, said the company's accusations that she had kept the money before cutting off communication online had 'really, really upset' her.

Communication: Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, the 27-year-old former Married At First Sight star claimed she'd told the company she was unwell and intended to return the money in two weeks' time

Jessika explained that her manager was now handling the disagreement.

In a lengthy post on Facebook recently, the company's director, Brooke Whale, claimed Jessika had accepted the payment but never delivered on a sponsored post for Soothe my Mood supplements.

'Since paying her $l,600 for 1 x Instagram post and 1 x Instagram story, she has completely fallen off the face of the earth,' Ms Whale wrote.

Taking a toll: Jessika, who did not disclose the nature of her illness, said the company's accusations that she had kept the money before cutting off communication online had 'really, really upset' her

'She suddenly stopped replying to emails. We sent her three to four emails spread out over about a month asking when the sponsored posts were coming and they all went unanswered...

'We have been struggling with this whole ordeal for about two months now and are getting absolutely nowhere.'

Jessika claimed the company's post had gone 'viral' and consequently she had been inundated with abuse on social media.

Stepping back: Jessika explained that her manager was now handling the disagreement

She said she only agreed to help the company 'out of the goodness of my own heart', knowing they're a new business.

'They're a small company starting out. The only reason why I agreed to help them on a very small amount of money - I normally charge $3,500 for a post - I'm only helping you because you're a small brand,' she added.   

Jessika said she prides herself on being professional, which is why she has brands she's repeatedly paid to endorse on Instagram. 

Bad for business: In a lengthy post on Facebook recently, the company's director, Brooke Whale, claimed Jessika had accepted the payment but never delivered on a sponsored post for Soothe my Mood supplements

'I've been crying over this. This is the first time I've ever been upset about social media,' she told Daily Mail Australia, breaking down in tears. 

'And I went through so much s**t with MAFS! And it's because this is my job, this is my work, and I pride myself with how I am online.'  

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, Whale said Soothe my Mood was still awaiting a refund.     

'I've been crying over this. This is the first time I've ever been upset about social media,' she told Daily Mail Australia, breaking down in tears

'We only shared our experience with her. If this came across as negative, that's because it was. Since posting to Facebook, we have also not engaged in any other social media activity relating to Jessika,' she said. 

'As we have said numerous times now, we just want our money back so we can cut ties with Jessika and move on. 

'We have no interest in an online feud and do not condone bullying of any kind. If Jessika has experienced bullying as a result of our Facebook post, we are sorry for that.' 

'We only shared our experience with her. If this came across as negative, that's because it was,' said the company's director in a statement to Daily Mail Australia
