Martin Clunes has dismissed hopes of a Men Behaving Badly reunion because it would 'just be hideous dirty old men talking about Kylie Minogue's bottom'.

The actor, 58, appeared on Loose Women via video link on Tuesday, after it was announced Doc Martin would end after 17 years. 

When asked if he would reprise his role as Gary Strang in Men Behaving Badly, Martin said: 'This dad bod thing is no good, you couldn't talk about a woman's body that way.'

The sitcom follows Gary (Martin) and Tony (Neil Morrissey) as London-based beer-guzzling flatmates revelling in mindless talks about women,  which puts their relationships in jeopardy. 

Martin told the panel: 'I don't think the subject matter would go down well with the woke millennials.

'This dad bod thing is no good, you couldn't talk about a woman's body that way. 

'It's open season on men and I don't know why because if you said it about a woman, you'd be called in front of a tribunal.' 

To which Denise Welch replied: 'We're celebrating it'.

Andrea McLean then asked: 'Why are you finishing Doc Martin?' 

Martin replied: 'All good things have to come to an end. We're at huge pains not to repeat ourselves and we've sort of done everything.

'It would be great to carry on but I don't think we could keep it as good. We've had 16 years.' 

ITV announced on Monday, the much-loved drama will come to an end in 2021 after 17 years on-screen.

Doc Martin first debuted on screens in 2004 with Martin playing the cantankerous GP, and the show has won a legion of fans with its heartwarming nature and idyllic Cornwall setting. 

In a statement, star Martin and producer Philippa Braithwaite explained that they've decided to end Doc Martin now to allow fans a chance to celebrate the show and its titular character with a final series.  

They said: 'We have loved making nine series of Doc Martin. When we launched the series in 2004 we could never have imagined how much our loyal viewers would take to the grumpy Doc like they have. 

'The series has avid fans both in the UK and throughout the world and we are thrilled that Doc Martin has topped the ratings every time.

'However, after sixteen years we now feel that the time has come to say goodbye to Portwenn. We will be making the tenth and final series in 2021 and we are very much looking forward to returning to Cornwall to film it.'
