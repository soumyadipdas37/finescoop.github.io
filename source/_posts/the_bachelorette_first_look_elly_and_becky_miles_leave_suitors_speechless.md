The Bachelorette is set to premiere on Channel 10 in coming weeks.

And during Monday's grand finale of The Masked Singer, the network released the first full-length trailer of the forthcoming season which will see sisters Elly and Becky Miles looking for love. 

In the new teaser, Elly, 25 kicks off the introductions.  

FIRST LOOK: On Monday night, sisters Elly, 25, (left) and Becky Miles, 30, (right) left suitors speechless as they revealed they are BOTH looking for love in a new teaser trailer for The Bachelorette 

'G'day, my name is Elly, you might know me from Matt Agnew's season of The Bachelor,' she begins. 

'I'm this year's Bachelorette. I'm back and I'm ready to find love, but this year things are going to be a little different.'

Upon meeting Elly and her older sister, Becky, 30, at the rose ceremony, one suitor appeared rather impressed with the news. 

'What is going on here?' he cheekily asked as he walked over to the pair.
