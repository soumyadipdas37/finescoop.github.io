The entrepreneur and restaurant owner-type It boys of the past have appeared to pave way for a new generation of 'society studs' - who come complete with a whole new image.

From Elizabeth Hurley's son Damien as the 'long-haired looker,' to Piers Morgan's son as the 'sporty squire,' Tatler has revealed the It boys of today. 

According to October's issue of the society fashion bible: 'There's a whole new set of rules for the It boys of today. They're not all entrepreneurs, club- and restaurant-owners – they're creators, makers and "curators".' 

With suits and ties traded in for the likes of the creative, sensitive and social media savvy, FEMAIL takes a look at some of the most eligible bachelors of today. 

THE SPORTY SQUIRE

According to Tatler, the long-haired sports journalist can often be found in his uniform of black athleisure at White City House or 5 Hertford Street, or out and about in Chelsea. 

Quite the jet-setter, his Instagram boasts exotic snaps from the likes of Antigua's Jumby Bay, St Tropez and Ibiza where he can be posing on the back of luxurious yachts,

THE LONG-HAIRED LOOKER

Damian Hurley, 18, is an up and coming model known for his strong resemblance to his mother, actress Elizabeth Hurley.

And the teen can often be found showing off his brunette locks while shirtless, and throwing a smoldering stare to the camera. 

He recently appeared in a very steamy make-up campaign alongside supermodel Irina Shayk, 34.

The sensual video, shot prior to the coronavirus lockdown, saw Damian straddled by the leather-clad bombshell as they promoted Pat McGrath's new Dark Star Mascara.

Sharing the video to Instagram Damian wrote alongside: 'the breathtaking @irinashayk and I for my favourite Aunty @PatMcGrathReal, directed by the extraordinary #StevenMeisel.'

His godfather's include Elizabeth's ex Hugh Grant, along with David Beckham, Elton John and Denis Leary.

If Damien isn't in Herefordshure, it's likely he's in London or Chelsea with the likes of India Warrender.

THE STYLISH SUITOR

The Maharaja of Jaipur

Padmanabh Singh, 22, who has walked for D&G, was crowned as the unofficial Maharaja of Jaipur in 2011, and is a member of the former ruling family of Jaipur State, in present-day Rajasthan, India, and worth an estimated £500-650 million.

Although his title is not officially recogised by law as India is a federal parliamentary democratic republic, the title is still highly respected, and was bestowed to him when his grandfather died, skipping his mother due to her gender, and his father - a former household staff member - as he had no royal blood.

Like his grandfather, Bhawani Sing, Padmanabh, is an accomplished polo player and the youngest ever member of a World Cup polo team in 2017 and the youngest winner of the Indian Open Polo Cup.

He has modelled for D&G and accompanied Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Philippe's daughter Ava to the Bal des Débutantes in Paris in 2017.

The young royal's Instagram - which boasts 130,000 followers - shows a life of travel, and a passion for polo playing across the world.

One picture sees him hanging out with the Dutch royal family, including King Willem Alexander, Queen Maxima and their children.

And he looks to be deeply religious, taking part in Vijaydashmi, a major Hindu festival celebrated at the end of Navaratri every year.

Exotic photos of his travels include South Africa, Italy - previously described as his favourite country - as well as Spain, Thailand, Colombia, Peru and Portugal. 

THE MODELISER

Orson Fry

Orson Fry, 24, who is in the band Soundtown, is the toyboy beau of fashion It girl Alexa Chung - who is 12 years his senior.

The pair are said to be so besotted that Orson has as good as moved into her swanky apartment in Dalston, East London, while she regularly cheers him on when he performs with his band, Soundtown, in pubs across the capital.

Tongues were set wagging in June when Alexa was spotted with her 'hunk' at the All Points East Festival at Victoria Park – a stone's thrown from her home – prompting whispers that she might have found happiness following her split from True Blood actor Alexander Skarsgard last year.

Orson, whose father is thrice married Cosmo Fry, 60 – a descendant of the Fry's chocolate dynasty – graduated from the private liberal arts college Bard in New York two years ago, and juggles singing in his band with working as a waiter.

His mother was Amanda Aspinall daughter of gambling tycoon and animal park owner John Aspinall. Orson was heartbroken when she died last January aged 61.

When he's not performing, he splits his time between The Ned and Berners Tavern, according to the high society bible.

THE AFFABLE ARISTO

Sam Chatto

Princess Margaret’s grandson Sam Chatto, who is 24th in line, and son to Lady Sarah and her actor husband Daniel Chatto, quit his commercial art job last summer, to launch a career selling homemade ceramics.

Following in the footsteps of his uncle, furniture designer David Linley, he decided to pursue a career as a craftsman.

The Old Etonian, who studied history of art at Edinburgh, launched his eponymous website, through which he is selling his own ceramics after becoming disillusioned with his job in the art market.

'I'm working in clay to create functional and sculptural wood-fired ceramics from my home and studio in West Sussex,' he explained previously.

'I've always had a strong affinity with creating objects, having spent much of my childhood crafting imagined landscapes and sculptural models, which naturally led me to clay during my later years at school.'

Now based in West Sussex, Sam previously trained in India to be a yoga instructor.

While Bella was pregnant with Jimmy, whose godfather is the designer Christian Louboutin. she resolved to give her baby the structured upbringing she never had.

‘After we came back from Morocco, I lived with Penny Guinness, who was a girlfriend of my father’s,’ she later said. ‘Even though we were travelling around in gypsy caravans, she always made me go to bed at 9pm. And I did enjoy that.

‘It stuck in my head for my own child-rearing. I wanted to be around as much as I possibly could.’
