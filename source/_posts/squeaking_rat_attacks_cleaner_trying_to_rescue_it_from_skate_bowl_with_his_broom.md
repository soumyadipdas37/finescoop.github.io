This is the bizarre moment a rat was caught on camera fighting back against a cleaner who was trying to rescue it from a skate park with his broom.

Zay Shaeffer, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, filmed the unexpected encounter between his friend Joseph and the squeaking rodent.

The critter charges toward the fully-grown male, who is attempting to clean the area, with remarkable success as the man is sent tumbling to the ground.

In the clip, Joseph can be seen wearing a green T-shirt, brown shorts and a bandana as he frantically waves a broom around.

The rat is hopping around energetically near his feet before it scuttles off toward the other side of the bowl.

Joseph chases after the rodent as it squeals with Zay urging his friend to take it easy.

But just a few seconds later the rat makes an unexpected turn and runs directly toward Joseph before getting caught up under his feet.

The cleaner is sent flying to the ground in a panic but quickly gets back up.

He kicks the animal aside before it launches a second attack which causes him to lose his balance and stumble once again.

Zay, from behind the camera, says: 'I told you, you don't want to get in there with that thing Joseph.' 

The video then cuts off but Zay and Joseph said afterwards that they eventually cleared the rat from the bowl by using an abandoned BMX as a makeshift ladder for it to climb. 

Speaking after the unusual interaction, Zay said: 'We were just working together one morning and picking up trash at the skatepark.

'When we ran across that rat stuck in the skate bowl.

'It chased me out first and then Joseph got in there for whatever reason.'
