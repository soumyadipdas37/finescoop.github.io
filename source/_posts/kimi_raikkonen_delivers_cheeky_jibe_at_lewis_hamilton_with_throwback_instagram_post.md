Formula 1 star Kimi Raikkonen has made no secret of his longing for the sport's more daring days off the track to return - and has cheekily hit out at world champion Lewis Hamilton via a hilarious meme.

The side-by-side montage shows a shirtless James Hunt, who won the 1976 championship, smoking and drinking.Â 

A picture of Hamilton, dressed head to toe in a very questionable matching outfit, has been added in next to him to underline the drastic change between drivers past and present.

Hamilton's questionable outfit has been compared to the lavish lifestyle of the late James Hunt

Raikkonen has compared his own rock and roll ways to Hamilton by posting a photo of himself looking worse for wear and accompanying it with the caption, 'Not all hope is lost yet!'

The six-time champion Hamilton has been snapped aboard a scooter in patterned clothes, complete with bucket hat. He was also caught wearing pink socks and white trainers while posing.

The photo of Hamilton and Hunt has provided his rival Raikkonen with some perfect material for a sly dig, and the 40-year-old duly delivered by titling the meme 'Evolution of a Formula 1 driver'.

James Hunt, the 1976 world champion, has proved a great source of inspiration for Raikkonen

Raikkonen's admiration for Hunt has been made clear over the years. The image of himself appearing slightly intoxicated, cigarette in hand, closely mirrors the former British racer's lavish lifestyle.

Hunt became well known for enjoying the high life away from his days competing on the circuit.

In 2007, Raikkonen even entered a snowmobile race under the name of his hero.

He also raced at Monaco in 2012 wearing a helmet designed to resemble the same one Hunt sported during his memorable 1976 season.
