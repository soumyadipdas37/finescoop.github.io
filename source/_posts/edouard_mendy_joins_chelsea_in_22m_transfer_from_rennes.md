It's seventh heaven for Chelsea with goalkeeper Eduoard Mendy the latest arrival at Stamford Bridge.

The 28-year-old has joined the Blues in a £22million transfer from Ligue 1 outfit Rennes - in what will be a major boost to manager Frank Lampard.

Mendy is now expected to become Chelsea's No 1 with Lampard increasingly frustrated at Kepa Arrizabalaga's high-profile mistakes.

Kepa Arrizabalaga is the Blues current No 1 but he is much-maligned after several mistakes

Chelsea conceded 54 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and Lampard wants Mendy to help eradicate such a poor record. 

'I am so excited to be joining Chelsea,' Mendy told the club's official website. 

'It's a dream for me to be a part of this exciting squad and to work with Frank Lampard and all of his coaching staff. I look forward to meeting my team-mates and can't wait to get started.' 

His arrival takes Chelsea's outlay this summer beyond £250m following the purchases of Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr, Thiago Silva  and Kai Havertz.

On signing Mendy, Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia said: 'As soon as Petr Cech and our technical team identified Edouard as the most suitable goalkeeper to complement our existing group, there was only one player we wanted to bring in. 

'Edouard arrives following a season of real success with Rennes, he is ambitious for more, and we welcome him to our club.'
