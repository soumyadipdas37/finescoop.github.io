They were arguably one of the most popular music groups of the 90s, but Savage Garden's Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones went their separate ways back in 2001. 

And on Thursday, Darren, 47, left fans around the world heartbroken as he brutally shut down calls for a reunion.  

Speaking in an Instagram Q&A, the singer called his friendship with Daniel, 46, 'toxic' and 'dysfunctional'.

The way they were:  They were arguably one of the most popular music groups of the 90s, but Savage Garden's Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones (pictured in 1997) went their separate ways back in 2001

After prompting his fans to 'ask me anything', one follower pleaded with Darren to consider doing a reunion.   

'Can you please do a Savage Garden Reunion ? I will buy it out if I have to,' they wrote. 

He brutally replied: 'Imagine if you had come out and survived a really dysfunctional and toxic relationship and then for years later people would ask you to please get back in that relationship.'

In the past the pair have alluded to a massive falling out and back in 2019, Daniel admitted that he doesn't have a 'healthy relationship' with former band member Darren.  

'I saw him at my manager's wedding in Los Angeles a couple of years ago. We just acknowledged each other. We said hello,' he told radio show 97.3's Bianca, Mike & Bob.  

'We didn't delve into the past. That's how our relationship functions these days. We don't have the most healthy, workable relationship any more.

The musician added: 'I still love the guy dearly. We are just different people. There's no wrongdoing. It's just different directions and different people. We just don't have a friendship any more or working relationship.'

The Truly Madly Deeply singer also shot down any plans for a reunion tour, claiming any kind of comeback would seem 'calculated' and like 'bulls**t'.

'Our legacy is that we have injected a bit of love into the planet … and if we tried to go back and recreate that I think it would be calculated and BS. The answer is no,' Daniel said.
