Anna Heinrich is expecting her first child, a daughter, with husband Tim Robards in the coming months. 

And on Tuesday, the soon-to-be mum flaunted her growing baby bump on Instagram as she soaked up the sun. 

The radiant 33-year-old looked happy and relaxed while sunbaking in a skimpy white bikini.

'SPEED BUMP AHEAD #babybump #babyonboard #speedbumpahead,' she captioned the picture. 

In the photo, Anna was shading her eyes from the sun as she lay on her side showing off her baby belly. 

She flaunted her natural beauty with minimal makeup and was sporting a white manicure that matched her swimsuit.

Anna and Tim recently enjoyed a luxurious holiday at Byron Bay's Blackbird resort. 

Last week, The Bachelor star shared a stunning photo, as well as video footage, to Instagram of their picturesque surroundings. 

'Getting out of Sydney is a luxury these days and I'm certainly not taking it for granted. Good to finally spend time with my hubby,' Anna wrote.

The trip comes after Anna spoke to The Sunday Telegraph's Stellar magazine about the stress of being separated from Tim, who until recently was working in Melbourne on Neighbours. 

Tim made the 'gut-wrenching decision' to leave Melbourne and quit his job on the soap, in order to be with Anna in Sydney, amid COVID-19 travel restrictions.

'It's been so stressful for him. For both of us. We're both really struggling with the decision. I know how hard he's worked,' she said.

'The past six weeks have been really stressful, it's been one curveball after another, and when hotel quarantine came in, we realised it meant that if there was an emergency, Tim would not be able to get back to me,' Anna said.
