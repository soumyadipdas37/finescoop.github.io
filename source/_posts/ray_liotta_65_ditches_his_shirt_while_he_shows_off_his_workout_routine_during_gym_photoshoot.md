His tough-guy good looks have kept him in the spotlight for decades.

And Ray Liotta proved he still has what it takes to earn eyes while sharing his fitness routine during a Tuesday photoshoot at his Venice, California gym.

The 65-year-old Goodfellas star wasn't afraid to bare his brawny body, seen stripping off his tee shirt during his workout.

Ray was ready to sweat in a pair of light joggers and a matching black tee shirt.

The star - who has been dating 45-year-old Jacy Nittolo - had some spring in his step courtesy of some Nike kicks with supportive neon green soles.

He did some barbell curls before moving onto his back to complete some reclining chest presses with dual dumbbells.

During his workout Ray made it clear he was more than capable of keeping up with his younger girlfriend.

And it looked like things were going strong for Liotta and girlfriend Jacy during a PDA packed lunch date in the Pacific Palisades last week.

Nittolo, a mother-of-four, has suggested the duo are in it for the long haul, kicking off the new year with a January 1st Instagram shot of the pair which was captioned: '2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025.........' 

The Field of Dreams actor was past married to actress Michelle Grace from 1997 thru 2004. 

The pair are parents to actress Karsen Liotta, 21, who's appeared with her dad and Jennifer Lopez on the NBC show Shades of Blue. 

Love: Nittolo has alluded to the idea that theirs was a long-term relationship on Instagram

This month marks the 30th anniversary of his signature film Goodfellas, in which he played the main role of Henry Hill.

Liotta reflected on appearing in the Martin Scorsese film, which also starred Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino, in a chat with Men's Journal in 2016.

'That was a pretty momentous moment in my career,' he said. 'The fact that Scorsese was directing. All of a sudden Bob came into the project.

He recalled: 'My mother was sick with cancer and died in the middle of us filming. The fact that that was going on made me less intimidated by the situation, I believe, because I was thinking, "My mother is dying of cancer. I am going to come here and be afraid of a guy who is an actor?"'
