David Alexander won $10,000 on Wednesday's episode of Big Brother: All-Stars, but he may have squandered his shot at the show's $500,000 grand prize.

During the week's veto competition, six houseguests were asked to dive into a vat of beach inflatables and find a special T-shirt that would give them veto power.

Almost immediately, the 30-year-old sales rep found a tee worth $10,000, and took that prize rather than search for the shirt that might take him off the block.

Questionable strategy: David Alexander won $10,000 on Wednesday's episode of Big Brother: All-Stars, but he may have squandered his shot at the show's $500,000 grand prize

He'd felt sure he was safe because he was up for eviction against Kevin Campbell, 40, an ad agency executive from Chula Vista, California, who'd been nominated five times.

But Kevin knew that David's decision was 'a $10,000 mistake,' as it showed that he felt untouchable enough to go for the money rather than the power.

Head of Household Cody Calafiore, 29, won the golden power of veto instead, and used it to keep his nominations the same, meaning David was still up for eviction.

One by one, the houseguests turned against David, revealing that they had lost respect for him.

Even Enzo Palumbo, 42, his chief ally in the house, was dumbfounded by his decision.

'Bro, we might have to send him on his way now because of that,' he told Tyler Crispen, 23.

In a confessional, Enzo added, 'What the hell is David thinking going for the prize when he's on the block? I think it's a big piece of doo-doo pie that he did that.'

'I tried to help him out,' he added. 'I was even willing to save him if I won the veto. David may just have thrown this whole game away for $10k.'

Cody was similarly flabbergasted, privately asking David, 'Why would you go for the 10 Gs right away? You're not safe. Never feel like you're safe.'

'I was feeling like I wasn't the target, and I was feeling really good about the $10k,' David said to the cameras. 'But after talking to Cody, I'm starting to feel a little iffy about it. Houseguests can now use that against me to vote me out. So on the one hand, I have $10,000. On the other hand, that could lead to eviction.'

'Oh my goodness,' he worried, running his hands through his hair. 'Did I make a mistake?'

As the show opened, Cody explained where things stood in the BB household.

He said that he had nominated Kevin and David because they were the only two people in the house that he was not in an alliance with, and Kevin was '100 percent' his target.

'He is someone who I know will come after me, so he needs to go,' Cody revealed, adding that if necessary, he could backdoor his ally Christmas Abbott, 35.

Like Cody, Christmas was part of The Committee, the house's largest alliance, which also included Daniele Donato, 34, Nicole Franzel, 28, Tyler Crispen, 23, and Memphis Garrett, 37.

Dani secretly wanted Christmas to be booted off the show, but couldn't convince Nicole, who didn't want to see another woman leave.

Nicole told Christmas she had her back, and cannily let her know that Dani was after her.

Christmas knew Cody was also eyeing her as a potential target if his nominations were undone by the veto competition, so she schemed to get into the competition to try to win it.

Kevin and David then spoke about their odds during the elimination round if neither of them won the power of veto.

Kevin revealed that he'd insulted Cody by accident, telling him the world did not revolve around him, which made Cody furious enough to go after him.

That was a relief to David, who deduced that he might not be the target for the week.

Enzo took David aside and told him that if he could win the competition, he'd be forcing Cody to put up someone he was aligned with and 'it's gonna get ugly in this house.'

'People are gonna start throwing each other under the bus,' Enzo said delightedly.

'This is the perfect opportunity to backdoor somebody,' Enzo continued. 'It's time. Let's shake things up, man. Let's make some enemies!' 

As everyone waited for the veto competition, Kevin had a moving conversation with David.

He said that everyone on the show acted like there had been only three Black contestants during season 22, but he was half-Black and half-Japanese, and no one recognized it.

'Sometimes it's so lonely to come from a mixed-race background, because I don't really fit in anywhere,' he added in a confessional. 'Even in your own community, you only get partially accepted. I'm hoping that being on Big Brother, maybe there's others out there who can relate to my experience and understand what it's like to go through life being multicultural and biracial.'

Cody had a shallower dialogue with Committee members, who randomly explained to him that people from Texas were called 'Texans,' and people from California were 'Californians.'

'I can't even tell you how much I've learned in this house,' Cody said. 'Zingbot [the house robot] told me I have an IQ of 10, but by the time I get out I'll probably be around, easily, like a 22 to 25.'

When it came time for the veto competition, Cody, Kevin and David were joined by Nicole, Tyler, and Enzo, whose names were drawn from the button box.

Christmas was upset at not having been picked. 'I can't win if I can't play,' she cried.

The veto competition required all six chosen houseguests to search for tie-dyed t-shirts in a huge vat of inflated beach balls and food-themed floaties.

If they found one, they were to present it to Otev, a tie-dyed dinosaur who had 'lost' his favorite one after a party at Will's house.

Almost immediately, David unearthed a tee worth $10,000, and was thrilled.

After several rounds, Cody found Otev's 'favorite' tee and won the competition.

David's prize incensed Christmas, who felt he should have been more focused on getting veto power and ensuring his safety than pursuing cash.

'I'm just flabbergasted,' she told the cameras. 'He's grabbing the money, and he's expecting to stay this week?'

Spirited response: David's prize incensed Christmas, who felt he should have been more focused on getting veto power and ensuring his safety than pursuing cash

Cody agreed with her. 'David going for the money, instead of the veto, puts a huge target on his back,' he said, resolving to keep the nominations the same.

The HoH knew the peace brought by his veto decision would be short-lived.

'We're going to get to a point where the alliance is going to target each other,' he acknowledged. 'It's going to be dog-eat-dog in here, and there's no telling who's going to get bit.'

Big Brother: All-Stars will return Thursday on CBS with a triple eviction.
