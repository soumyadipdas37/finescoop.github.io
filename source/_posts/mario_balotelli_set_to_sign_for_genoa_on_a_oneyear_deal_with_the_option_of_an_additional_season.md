Mario Balotelli is close to securing a move to Genoa from Brescia.

As reported by La Gazzetta Dello Sport, Balotelli is poised to join Genoa on a one-year deal with the option of an additional year.

Balotelli's latest move is set to bring his frustrating spell at Brescia to an end.

Last year Balotelli joined Brescia on a three-year deal but the move certainly didn't go to plan, with Brescia being relegated to Serie B and the striker scoring just five goals in 19 Serie A appearances.

Balotelli didn't play for Brescia after March 9 last season, with the club hugely frustrated when he turned up for training eight kilos overweight.

Subsequently Balotelli was refused entry into Brescia's training ground once lockdown restrictions in Italy were eased.

The 30-year-old has had a hugely eventful career that has encompassed him playing for a wide range of clubs, including Inter Milan, Manchester City, AC Milan, Liverpool, Nice and Marseille.  

Although he was previously linked with a move to Romanian side Cluj, it appears that Balotelli will be remaining in Italy, and he will hope that his latest spell in Serie A will be considerably more successful than the previous one.
