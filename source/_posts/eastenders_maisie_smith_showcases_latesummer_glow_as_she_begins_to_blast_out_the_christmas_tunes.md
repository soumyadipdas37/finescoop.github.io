 2020 is a year that many would love to see the back of as soon as possible. 

And Maisie Smith revealed her own eagerness to reach the year's end, as she revealed in an Instagram post on Sunday that she has started playing Christmas songs. 

The EastEnders star, 19, who was sporting a natural look, shared a sizzling selfie with the caption: 'Summers gone; Alexa play Santa tell me by Ariana Grande ⛄️'

And despite her wintery words, Maisie still had her summer glow on as she posed for the snap next to a palm tree.

The Other Boleyn Girl actress wore minimal make-up to allow her natural tan to shine through and reveal her freckles. 

Maisie sported a pair of giant gold hoop earrings that matched the elegant chain around her neck.

She wore a summery cream denim jacket with a thinly knitted white jumper beneath. 

Throwback: Maisie's latest post was strikingly similar to another selfie shared just weeks before

The image was strikingly similar to another selfie posted just weeks before, suggesting that this was a summer throwback. 

Maisie, who is best known for playing Tiffany Butcher inEastEnders, is set to appear on the 2020 edition of Strictly Come Dancing in a month's time. 

She is just days away from beginning training for Strictly's new series, which will begin in October after being shortened due to the COVID-19 crisis, but is yet to even meet her professional dance partner. 

Good Morning Britain presenter Ranvir Singh revealed that the contestants haven't prepared for the show yet earlier this month, leaving 2013 contestant Susanna Reid shocked.

She said: 'It's all happening a bit later. We can't - we've not met our partner yet. I am eating fewer Pringles if that counts towards training, but that's as far as it got.'

It was recently claimed that the male professional dancers are in fierce competition to be partnered up with Maisie, as she has  prior experience in the ballroom.

A source told The Sun: 'All the male pros really want to partner with her, not just because she’s young and fit, but she’s also proven herself to be a brilliant dancer.
