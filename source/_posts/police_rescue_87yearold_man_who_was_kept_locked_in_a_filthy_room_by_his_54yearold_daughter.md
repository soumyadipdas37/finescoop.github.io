Police officers have rescued an 87-year-old man who was held against his will by his own daughter at her home in central Mexico.

The shocking discovery took place last Thursday while agents were serving a warrant for the repossession of unpaid goods at the Celaya, Guanajuato, residence of a woman identified only as 54-year-old Leticia.

While removing some of the items from the house the cops heard cries emerging from one of the bedrooms, where they found her elderly father Bonifacio.

An 87-year-old man identified by the Celaya police as Bonifacio was safely removed from his 54-year-old daughter's home in Guanajuato, Mexico, last Thursday. The decision to take him from the house was made after cops heard him crying while he was locked inside a room at the residence

Cops discovered that the 87-year-old man was forced to sleep in a filthy room littered with trash on the floor. The elderly man's bed was a wood bunked frame that this not have a mattress

Photos shared by the Celaya municipal police showed the bedroom's grimy conditions with bottles and trash littering the floor, and dirty clothes lying on top of the bed frame.

Bonifacio was forced to sleep on the bottom part of a wooden bunk frame without the support of a mattress. 

The elderly man, who suffered from an unknown condition on both of his legs, was removed from his daughter's house because his living condition was deemed inhumane. He was then taken to a local medical clinic and was transferred to city-operated shelter for seniors.

Leticia was arrested and placed in the custody of the Guanajuato state prosecutor's office, which as of Monday hadn't determined if any charges were going be filed against her.
