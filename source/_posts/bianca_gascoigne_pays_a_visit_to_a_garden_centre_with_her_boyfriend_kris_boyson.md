Kris Boyson and Bianca Gascoigne looked every inch the happy couple as they paid a visit to a garden centre in London on Sunday.

The couple cut a casual figure for the outing as Bianca wrapped her arm around her other half during the trip.

Bianca, 33, showcased her incredible figure as she donned a lilac off the shoulder top with a matching pair of shorts.

The reality star also sported a pair of teal trainers while she let her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders.

The former Celebrity Big Brother star completed her look for the day by carrying a cream handbag. 

Kris, 31, showed off his gym-honed physique in a black T-shirt and a pair of dark green shorts. 

Bianca recently revealed she moved in with Kris after their first date in a new interview.

The couple took their relationship to the next level as they spent the UK's nationwide lockdown together just weeks after embarking on a romance.

Despite dating for only five months, the reality stars admitted they'd definitely want to get married and start a family in the future as they 'completely trust' each other.

Kris told new! magazine: 'We've spent every single day together practically since we met. You wouldn't lock down with someone for 100 days if it was a showmance.'

Bianca and Kris were introduced to each other three years ago when he provided her with healthy meals in preparation of a charity fight, which got cancelled when her opponent, his ex Katie Price, pulled out.

They lost contact for a while, before fitness enthusiast Kris slid into her Instagram DMs earlier this year.

The couple currently reside in Kent and are renovating their pad with a cinema room and a new bar.
