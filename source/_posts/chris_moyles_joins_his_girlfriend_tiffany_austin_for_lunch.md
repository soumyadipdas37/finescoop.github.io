Happy days: Chris Moyles stepped out with his girlfriend Tiffany Austin on Monday

Chris was keeping out the chill in his windbreaker style jacket as he emerged in stylish sunglasses.

Putting safety first, he later pulled a mask over his face and his hood up.  

Tiffany, who has a career in artist management and has worked with Boy George in the past, showed off her pretty features by going without make-up.

While she was going for an off-duty style, she still added chic touches with the addition of trendy thin rimmed sunglasses. 

Tiffany flashed a hint of her leg from beneath her leggings which featured sexy sheer panels extending the entire length of her pins. 

Her hair was worn in sleek lengths with honeyed highlights worked through. 

Sweet: When their union first came to light, sources told The Sun: 'They have been going out for at least a year and a half but have done well to keep it on the down low'

When their union first came to light, sources told The Sun: 'They have been going out for at least a year and a half but have done well to keep it on the down low. 

'They are both very laid back, so neither has made a big song or dance about it or splashed soppy pics across social media...

'Though they do make a great couple and are already getting serious.'
