Taking viewers from the beginning right through to the present day, the series will remember the golden couples, the epic fall outs, the holiday high jinks, and the many turns of phrase and wardrobe choices that have become synonymous with the BAFTA award winning show.

The TOWIE Years accompanies a brand new eighteen episode series of The Only Way Is Essex, which returns to ITVBe in the Autumn.

Paul Mortimer, Head of Digital Channels & Acquisitions, ITV said 'In its decade on screens TOWIE has produced some of the most jaw dropping, talked about TV moments in reality TV history, and as we reach this milestone year for the show, what better opportunity to look back and remember everything that's made The Only Way Is Essex an unmissable ten years of TV.'
