Alessandra Ambrosio is back in Los Angeles after a stunning luxury vacation in The Maldives.

And on Friday the Victoria's Secret stunner was in great spirits as she left the Immigration Offices in Downtown LA with evidence of her newly acquired US citizenship.

Moving to the United States to pursue her modeling career as a young teen, the 39-year-old Brazilian bombshell is finally an American some 20 years later.

US citizen: Alessandra Ambrosio, 39, was in great spirits on Friday as the Brazilian born model was spotted leaving the Immigration Offices in Downtown LA. The model and mother of two moved to the US as a young teen to pursue her modeling career

The mother of two looked stunning as she walked with a pep in her step for her transformative outing. 

Clad in a blue silk quarter-length shirt and light denim jeans that hit just above her ankle, the five-foot-nine supermodel paired her effortlessly chic ensemble with a pair of brown strappy heels and a caramel colored bag. 

She clasped her citizenship documents in her arm as she strode down the street.

 The natural beauty adorned her outfit with some delicate bracelets and necklaces and topped off the look with a pair of round-framed sunglasses. 

She wore her brunette locks down straight, her hair blowing in the wind as she strutted the west coast streets like a runway.  

The veteran model reportedly only spent about 15 minutes inside the Federal building to get all her necessary documents before leaving with a huge smile on her face. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the actual naturalization ceremonies have been cancelled for safety purposes, though Alessandra was able to get all she needed after following the proper mandated protocols.

Loved up: Alessandra and boyfriend of two years, Nicolo Oddi enjoy a romantic moment on their family vacation to The Maldives

 Just last week the GalFloripa swimwear designer was seen on a picturesque vacation in The Maldives with her two children from ex Jamie Mazur, Anja Louise, 12, and Noah Phoenix, 8 as well as her boyfriend of two years, Italian businessman Nicolo Oddi, 39.  

The family was joined by her parents as the extended Ambrosio-Mazur clan celebrated her daughter's 12th birthday and enjoyed a relaxing time away staying at the gorgeous Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi.

After coming back from her trip away, the model seems as if she is ready to get back to work, tackling her swimsuit line head on while modeling its products from home and raising her two children. 

With the modeling industry slowly starting to ramp up again Alessandra's schedule will no doubt be ramping up soon so for now the beauty is enjoying both the little moments and the big moments in her life.
