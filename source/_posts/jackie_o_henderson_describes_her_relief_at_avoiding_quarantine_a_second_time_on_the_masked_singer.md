Jackie 'O' Henderson has described her relief at avoiding quarantine a second time, after filming was halted on The Masked Singer after COVID cluster on set. 

The radio personality, who is a judge on the show, had already spent two weeks in lokdown and was 'shocked' when she did not have to do it a second time.

She told the Adelaide Advertiser on Sunday: 'At first we thought we did have to do it twice so I was all prepared to do it... I had come to terms with the fact that this was the way it is.

'I knew it wasn't going to be fun because after the two weeks already doing the quarantine in Melbourne, that was mentally enough. 

'I was okay about doing it, so when we found out we didn't have to, we were in shock. It was probably the most amazing thing I've felt in a long time.' 

She added: 'We were all away from family, it wasn’t just me and everyone was going through a really difficult time. 

'I am still being careful though because I am still scarred from my Melbourne experience.'

Jackie and host Osher Günsberg were granted hotel quarantine exemptions from NSW authorities to film The Masked Singer finale in Sydney last Tuesday night.   

Both stars were allowed back into the state after undergoing a mandatory 14 days of self isolation in Melbourne, following an outbreak of COVID-19 on the show's Docklands set. 

'I am back in Sydney, and last night I filmed the final episode of The Masked Singer,' Jackie O revealed on her Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday morning. 

According to The Age, Jackie O and Osher were granted hotel quarantine exemptions from NSW authorities on their return to the state, as they had already undergone isolation in Melbourne.

Production on the show halted last month just hours before the show's finale was set to be taped. The rest of the season had already been recorded. 

Seven dancers tested positive for COVID-19 on August 22, and the show's stars were ordered to self-isolate immediately. 

'Production on The Masked Singer has been immediately suspended as a result of several crew members receiving a positive test result for COVID-19,' Channel 10 said in a statement at the time.

'The health and safety of the community, and our staff and production partners is our number one priority.'
