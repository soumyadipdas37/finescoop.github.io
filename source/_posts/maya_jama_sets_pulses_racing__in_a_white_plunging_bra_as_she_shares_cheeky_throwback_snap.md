According to The Sun, a source said: 'Drake definitely appeared to have a soft spot for Maya and late in 2018 he started following her on Instagram out of the blue. She totally ignored him and didn't follow him back as she was with Stormzy.

'Even when she split with Stormzy it's not something Maya wanted to pursue and she has left it.'  

Maya separated from her ex-boyfriend, 27, in August last year after four years together, since then she has remained single.
