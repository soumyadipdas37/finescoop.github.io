She's best known for her co-hosting duties alongside Karl Stefanovic on Today.

But on Wednesday, Allison Langdon offered fans a rare look into her personal life as a doting mother-of-two.

The 41-year-old looked every inch the cool mum as she shared a photo to Instagram alongside her son Mack, three, and daughter Scout, two.

Super cool: On Wednesday, Today's Allison Langdon looked every inch the mother on holiday as she sat in the boot of her car with son Mack, three, and daughter Scout, two 

'Holidays ... tailgating with the fam,' she wrote underneath the photo.

Opting for a casual low-key look, Allison looked world's away from her usual breakfast television attire as she sat with her children in the back of their car.

Allison kept a firm hold of little Scout, while Mack was seen smiling while he looked away into the distance.

The post was quickly inundated with comments with fans.
