Arsenal legend Tony Adams has claimed Bernd Leno is not a 'top four goalkeeper' and has questioned Mikel Arteta's decision to sell Emiliano Martinez.

Leno was the Gunners' No1 for much of the 2019-2020 season but picked up an injury towards the end of the campaign and Martinez was finally given his chance in the first team.

The goalkeeper had been loaned out six times in eight years but grasped his opportunity with impressive performances, helping the club to win the FA Cup against Chelsea and the Community Shield against Liverpool.

Adams also questioned Mikel Arteta's decision to sell Emiliano Martinez to Aston Villa

But Leno's return to fitness saw him reinstated as the club's No1 and Martinez was sold to Aston Villa - where he has already kept two clean sheets in his first two games. He also saved a penalty on his debut against Sheffield United.

And after watching Leno concede three goals against Liverpool on Monday, former Gunners' defender Adams questioned his credentials as a top four 'keeper while highlighting the impact of Martinez at the end of last season.

'Martinez was incredible in their cup run. He was absolutely sensational,' Adams told Astro SuperSport.

'And I do like big ones and what Leno does struggle with, for me, is crosses and stuff.

'But it isn't about me. Arteta's gone, 'No, Leno is my number one, I like him,' and he's put all his faith in him. But I don't believe that he's a top four goalkeeper, for me. 

'Martinez, it was coincidence, everything fell into place for Arsenal in the cup competition last year, it was like it was written in the stars.

'This goalkeeper comes in – been at the club for 10 years and not played 10 games – and he stops everything! He was a man possessed, he was absolutely incredible. And for me, he was the No1.

'Now you've made the opportunity, you've got experience, go okay, yep. But Arteta's the man and he's chosen a different goalkeeper.'

Leno kept a clean sheet in the opening game against Fulham but has conceded four goals in his last two matches. The Gunners face Sheffield United, who are yet to score this season, at the Emirates on Sunday.
