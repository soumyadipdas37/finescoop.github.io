Fans were shocked earlier this year when former RHONY star Tinsley Mortimer shared that she had made out with her younger sister, Dabney.

And Andy Cohen wanted to dive a little deeper into the kiss during the Real Housewives of New York reunion on Thursday night.

The Bravo patriarch asked the socialite for a few more specifics on the situation, to which Mortimer insisted was just a joke.

'Tinsley, how does one make out with one's sister as a joke?' the Watch What Happens Live host asked.

'So, this was like at least 20 years ago,' Mortimer explained. 'We were doing a joke. I was with a bunch of girls and my sister was one of them and we were saying, like, 'How do we kiss?''

She added: 'So we were showing each other how we kissed and so my sister happened to be one of the people that we were both showing how we kiss and it was my sister. It was like two seconds. It's no big deal.'

Viewers were left wide-eyed upon learning that Mortimer made out with her sibling 10 years ago, a revelation she made while hanging out with Leah McSweeney and her sister Sarah on a RHONY trip to Newport, Rhode Island.

McSweeney pecked her sister Sarah on the cheek as the ladies snapped a selfie while watching the sunset over the harbor. 

'Leah always gets a little too sensual with me at moments,' Sarah joked while brushing off Leah's kiss.

'I have made out with my sister,' Tinsley told the girls, who appeared stunned. 'As a joke… it was like "no this is how you do it."'

Mortimer later found herself locking lips with Leah outside of a restaurant after drinking the night away with the housewives, all of which aired on an episode of the popular Bravo show. 

Tinsley left the series midway through the season after her on-off boyfriend, Scott Kluth, proposed with a stunning diamond ring in his hometown of Chicago.
