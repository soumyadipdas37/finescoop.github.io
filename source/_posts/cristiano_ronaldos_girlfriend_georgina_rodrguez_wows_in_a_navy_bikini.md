They have been soaking up the sun during lockdown. 

And Cristiano Ronaldo, 35, and his partner Georgina Rodríguez, 26, were sure to show off their summer bodies in a latest snapshot from their holiday.

The former shop assistant looked stunning in a tiny bikini as she held hands with some of their brood alongside her incredibly ripped beau.  

Wow: Cristiano Ronaldo, 35, and his partner Georgina Rodríguez, 26, were sure to show off their summer bodies in a latest snapshot from their holiday

Georgina added a caption on the shot reading: 'De la mano, con muchos sueños por cumplir', which translates to: 'Hand in hand, with many dreams to fulfill'.

Georgina and Ronaldo had been isolating with their family - Cristiano Jr, 10, Ronaldo's twins Eva and Mateo, three, and their daughter Alana, two, after relocating from Portugal to Turin in northern Italy. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family isolated together in Madeira, after three of Ronaldo's team-mates - Daniele Rugani, Paulo Dybala and Blaise Matuidi - were among the first Serie A players to test positive novel coronavirus.

They returned to Turin at the start of May and were required to spend 14 days at home in self-isolation as per government rules for international arrivals.

Ripped! Cristiano also shared a sizzling snap as he showcased his sportsman physique 

In January, Georgina sparked speculation that she'd tied the knot with her footballer beau when she referred to him as her 'husband' in a gushing post celebrating her 26th birthday.  

Sharing a snapshot of herself and Ronaldo posing with their children, Georgina wrote: 'Happy 2️⃣6️⃣ for me, very happy. I can't ask life more. Just a lot of health for my family and me and to always enjoy them. 

'Thank you all for your congratulations, flowers and therefore love ✨ And Thank you to my husband for giving me the best of life, our children. I love you.'

Sweet: Georgina recently shared a sweet tribute to her man as he prepared to go to his first football match since the season was suspended due to COVID-19

In Spanish, 'marido' is often used to describe a common law husband, while 'esposo' is more commonly employed as a description for a legally wed male.

When contacted by MailOnline, representatives for Ronaldo declined to comment.

For his part, Ronaldo shared the same snapshot on his own Instagram account, alongside the caption, in which he shared that he 'love[s] [her] so much'.

The Portuguese sportsman wrote alongside the heartwarming image: 'Congratulations my love! I wish you a very nice day! You are a great woman and an excellent mother for our children. I love you so much honey!'
