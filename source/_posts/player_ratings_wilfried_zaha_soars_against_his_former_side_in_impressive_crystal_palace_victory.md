Crystal Palace ensured Manchester United got their season off to a nightmare start with a deserved 3-1 victory at Old Trafford.

 A Wilfried Zaha double added to an early Andros Townsend ensured the Eagles made it two wins out of two in the Premier League this season.

Sportsmail's David Kent gives his verdict on displays from players of both sides at Old Trafford. 

Wilfried Zaha was on target twice as Crystal Palace ran out 3-1 winners over Man United 

MANCHESTER UNITED - 4-2-3-1 

David De Gea - 7

Three good saves from Ayew kept United in it though moving from his line gifted Palace a killer penalty do-over .

Timothy Fosu-Mensah - 5

Handed shock start, struggled defensively and booked for poor foul on Mitchell but set up a goal.

Victor Lindelof - 3

Had a hand in all three goals - beaten by Schlupp, conceding a pen then being shrugged off by Zaha.

Victor Lindelof had a night to forget after having a hand in all three of Palace's goals

Harry Maguire - 5

Back from his summer troubles but looked off the pace and booked for a clumsy challenge on Zaha.

Luke Shaw - 5

Caught out by Townsend for the early goal, looked susceptible defensively and non-factor going forward.

Paul Pogba - 6

Tried to hold United together, and looked for an equaliser with a couple of long-range shots that at least troubled Guaita.

Scott McTominay - 7

Unlucky with a strike that bounced just wide, grafted hard but was just overwhelmed by having too much to do.

Marcus Rashford - 6

Never stopped trying but too many passes were wayward and too many shots easily blocked.

Bruno Fernandes - 6

An inspiration since January but listless, like all his team mates, here. Well marked by Palace’s midfield.

Dan James - 5

No surprise he was the sacrifice made for Greenwood at half-time. No penetration and sloppy with his crossing.

Daniel James was disappointing in the first half and his substitution came as no surprise

Anthony Martial - 6

Lack of service was glaring but well marked by Palace centre-halves when ball did come his way.

Subs

Mason Greenwood (for James, 46) - 5

Donny van der Beek (for Pogba, 66) - 8

Odio Ighalo (for Fosu-Mensah, 81) - 6

Subs not used: Henderson, Bailly, Fred, Ighalo, Wan-Bissaka, van der Beek.

CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1)

Vicente Guiaita - 6

Good handling from couple of long shots but fortunate that a first-half mis-kick did not fall for Rashford.

Joel Ward - 6

Showed great discipline especially when Greenwood came on, although had a hand in United’s goal.

Cheikhou Kouyate - 7

At fault for van der Beek’s goal but a rare error on a night when the back four protected Guaita superbly.

Cheikhou Kouyate (L) and Joel Ward (R) were part of a superb defensive display by Palace

Mamadou Sakho - 8

Very dominant display, unfazed by the pace of Martial or the movement of the other United forwards.

Tyrick Mitchell - 7

Showed great discipline in dealing with United’s wide men and relished his battle with Rashford.

James McArthur - 7

Strong midfield showing made sure Pogba and Bruno were not able to run the show.

James McCarthy - 7

Hard-working display and deserved a slice of luck when VAR ruled he had not tripped Pogba late in the first half.

Andros Townsend - 8

Took his goal well and threatened with a couple of dangerous shots in both halves without testing de Gea again.

Andros Townsend set Palace on their way and was a a threat for the Eagles throughout 

Jordan Ayew - 8

Forced de Gea into two saves either side of the break and his pacy run later won the pen which he missed.

Jeffrey Schlupp - 7

Movement and pace was problematic for a poor United defence and his play and cross for the goal brilliant.

Wilfried Zaha - 9

Led the line well and exploded in the second half with two killer goals, one a great solo effort.

Zaha ensured the victory with a powerful strike after a surge forward past Lindelof 

Subs

Eberechi Eze (for Schlupp, 74) - 6

Michy Batshuayi (for Ayew, 81) - 6

Luka Milivojevic (for McCarthy 87)

Subs not used: Hennessey, Meyer, Kelly, Inniss.

Referee: Martin Atkinson - 7
