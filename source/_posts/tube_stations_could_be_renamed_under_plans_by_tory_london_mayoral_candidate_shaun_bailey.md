A Tory London mayoral candidate wants to offer firms sponsorship deals to raise money for TfL meaning tube stations could be renamed.

Shaun Bailey plans to give companies the chance to bid to rename stations as part of a new advertising campaign inspired by the Dubai Metro.

The Conservative London mayoral candidate put forward the plans for a £100 million a year sponsorship deal according to The Telegraph.

Under these plans Knightsbridge Station could be renamed after Harrods, and Oxford Circus would be sponsored by brands with flagship stores nearby.      

Mr Bailey believes the initiative will raise up to half a billion pounds over five years for Transport for London (TfL).

He says it has been left with 'record levels of debt' by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.

Mr Bailey said that 'Dubai's entire Metro is barely the size of the District Line' (pictured, a commuter passing the Burj Khalifa, Dubai) 

This has worked in major cities across the globe including Dubai, Madrid and New York. 

Mr Bailey believes the size of the London Underground could generate higher revenues than in Dubai which has raised more than £300 million. 

There have only been branding of 21 stations across the network with 10-year sponsorship deals with firms including Emirates and First Gulf Bank.

Mr Bailey said: 'We need to fix the service that Londoners love. That's why I'll invite businesses to sponsor station names and Tube lines.

'Dubai makes £419 million through sponsorship. And Dubai's entire Metro is barely the size of the District Line.'
