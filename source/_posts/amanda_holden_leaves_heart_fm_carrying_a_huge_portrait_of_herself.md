She said: 'It is extraordinary. I think the number of negative complaints means this conversation is right and fundamental and should continue to happen. 

'What hasn’t really been highlighted is the fact that we were inundated with overwhelming positive response, hundreds of thousands of them.

'As BGT family, and Diversity is very much part of that family, and Ashley is doing a phenomenal job on BGT, we stand by him and stand by that performance 100 per cent.'

The TV star added of dancer and her new BGT co-judge Ashley Banjo: 'He sends out positive vibes to both the haters and the lovers of the piece that they did. He is saddened by negativity.'

On the show, presenter Piers, 55, reiterated his support for the routine saying: 'If you can't handle that without feeling the need to never watch BGT again or to complain to Ofcom, there's something wrong with you. 

'You, you're the problem! You're part of the problem.

'By the way, if you don't like me saying this, then don't watch us either. Don't watch Good Morning Britain. Because I agree with Ashley Banjo and Diversity. And if you can't handle it Britain, wake up.'
