She enjoyed incredible success as host of classic Australian series such as The Cartoon Connection, The Love Game and most famously, Lotto.

And it has been five years since Alex Wileman turned her back on her television fame to launch her now successful travel company, Local Eyes, with husband Jamie Creer.

The 59-year-old has now revealed she's more content than ever with her new life as a traveller, telling Woman's Day: 'I thought it would be awesome to be able to show people around like a local - and it's what I get to do every day. I'm living my dream!'

Alex explained that she always harboured a desire to work in the tourism after catching the travel bug on the Channel Seven docuseries, The World Around Us.

And with their high-end tour and sightseeing company quickly taking off, Alex and her husband roped in the assistance of their children, George, 29, Jock, 27, and Charlie, 25.

Speaking of their family and business dynamic, the blonde said: 'Living and working together might seem a bit close for comfort. There are relationship stressors, but in the end, we are family.'

The TV star also recalled juggling motherhood with her success on Lotto in the nineties, admitting that she would use all her free time to take her children camping and on 'good hands-on holidays'.

With this year's COVID-19 outbreak, Alex has been enjoying the slower pace of life with her 'down-to-earth and funny' husband Jamie, who she has been married to for 34 years.

'We have swim dates at 6 am in the morning. Recently because we haven't been as busy, we are taking road trips to look for places out clients might like to go.

'Times might be tough in tourism now, but nothing will stop us in forging ahead,' she added.

With border restrictions prohibiting Alex for travelling the length and breadth of Australia, she has undoubtedly been making the most of exploring her own backyard in New South Wales.

In recent months she had uploaded a slew of sun-kissed snaps from the likes of Byron Bay, Southern Highlands and the idyllic north coast.

Before her fame as a presenter, Alex was considered an eighties pin-up thanks to her 'Mellow Yellow' TV advertisement in 1985.
