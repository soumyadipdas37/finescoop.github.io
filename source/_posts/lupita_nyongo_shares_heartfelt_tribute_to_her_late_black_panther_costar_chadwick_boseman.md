She wrote: 'I write these words from a place of hopelessness, to honor a man who had great hope. I am struggling to think and speak about my friend, Chadwick Boseman, in the past tense. It doesn’t make sense. 

'The news of his passing is a punch to my gut every morning. I am aware that we are all mortal, but you come across some people in life that possess an immortal energy, that seems like they have existed before, that are exactly where they are supposed to always be – here! … that seem ageless… Chadwick was one of those people.

'Chadwick was a man who made the most of his time, and somehow also managed to take his time. I didn’t know him for long, but he had a profound effect on me in the time that I did. 

'When we came together to make Black Panther, I remember being struck by his quiet, powerful presence. He had no airs about him, but there was a higher frequency that he seems to operate from.

'You got the sense that he was fully present and also somehow fully aware of things in the distant future.

'As a result, I noticed that Chadwick never seemed rushed! He commanded his time with ease…And he put in the work with all of us. He showed up to every rehearsal and training and shoot day with his game face on. He was absorbent. Agile. 

'He set the bar high by working with a generosity of spirit, creating an ego-free environment by sheer example, and he always had a warm gaze and a strong embrace to share. 

'His large hands would descend on my shoulders and give them a squeeze that relieved me of the tensions I did not realize I was holding.

Memories: Recalling working with Chadwick, Lupita said he was 'impeccable' and she 'never heard him complain'

Lupita said: 'By pushing through and working with such high purpose in the films he chose to commit to, Chadwick has made the infinite his home'

She added: 'His power lives on and will reverberate for generations to come. He used his life force to tell meaningful stories'

Heartfelt: Lupita captioned the post: ‘For the beloved #ChadwickBoseman. #TakeYourTimeButDontWasteYourTime.'

'Chadwick’s hands were strong enough to carry the weight of the film and free enough to clasp mine when I needed it.'

She also wrote: 'My deepest condolences to his family, friends and to his loving wife, Simone, from whom I heard this phrase articulated so resonantly: #TakeYourTimeButDontWasteYourTime'.
