A Florida man has been charged with assault on a law enforcement officer after a scuffle around Senator Rand Paul as he left the White House following Donald Trump's speech to the RNC.

Paul and his wife were encircled by a crowd of protesters following Trump's address, and said they feared for their lives amid the 'crazed mob' of protesters.

'They were trying to push the police over to get to me,' he said. 

'They were grabbing at us, and it got worse and worse and worse, and finally, we decided to make a move - they were shouting threats to us, to kill us, to hurt us.'

Rand Paul and his wife were confronted by protesters as they left the White House August 27

Crowds of people tussled with law enforcement, and one officer had to go to hospital

On Wednesday the Department of Justice announced that a man had been arrested following the incident.

Brennen Sermon, 27, of Orlando, Florida, was charged on August 28 - the day after Trump's speech.

Police claim that, shortly after midnight, a Metropolitan Police Department officer was holding a police line at 14 and F Street NW when a protester kicked his bicycle and fled. 

The officer pursued, and police allege that Sermon punched the officer, who was left with a deep cut to his face and a severe swelling above his left eye.

The officer was taken to hospital, and received stitches. 

If Sermon is convicted, he could face up to 180 days in prison. He could also face a fine of up to $1,000. 

Paul, senator for Kentucky, said he feared for his life amid the 'attack' by the 'crazed mob'
