Erin Andrews is opening up about how she got the ax from Dancing With The Stars.

The dancing competition's former co-host, 42, admitted her firing came as a complete 'surprise,' talking about the situation in a new interview with Extra.

'It was a surprise,' Erin told the show. 'I got a phone call and I answered the phone. I was like, "This isn't good."'

Since being fired the Fox NFL reporter kept in close contact with co-host Tom Bergeron - who was canned from the dancing competition at the same time - as well as the dancers, who she called 'family'

'I text Tom, like once a week… and the dancers as well. That's a family… I danced on the show and then worked on the show for so many years, I always call it a Dancing With The Stars Mafia — once you're in, it's really hard to break away.' 

'That's a tight-knit group,' she went on. 'Sasha [Farber] and I will DM. I've gotten lovely messages from the dancers and so forth.'

Though her firing was a shock, Erin said she's happy for replacement Tyra Banks.  

Bad feeling: 'It was a surprise,' Erin told the show. 'I got a phone call and I answered the phone. I was like, "This isn't good."'

All smize on you! Erin said she's happy for replacement Tyra Banks, telling Extra 'She can nail the smizing and the walking in gowns and heels, so good for her'

'She can nail the smizing and the walking in gowns and heels, so good for her,' the Maine native remarked.

Tom, 65, was the host of DWTS from 2005 until 2020 while Erin replaced Brooke Burke-Charvet as the co-host of DWTS in 2014. 

While Erin is out of a job on DWTS, she's still plenty busy once NFL season starts up again.

'I go back to work September 13 in New Orleans,' she dished. 'Tom Brady makes his debut with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers… I am so grateful that the NFL is going and we are having a season.'
