Crowds who braved extreme weather conditions in Perth, Australia were treated to a doubly dazzling display in the skies above the city. 

An estimated 250,000 people turned out to watch the 28th annual Australia Day fireworks display in the western Australian city, despite fears weather conditions could disrupt the event.

The sky was lit up not only by fireworks but with spectacular flashes of lightning which occured in tandem with the organised displays.

High temperatures during the day and the threat of a huge thunderstorm in the evening had threatened to keep spectators away. 

But, though numbers were down on last year's event, crowds flocked to the Esplanade, the South Perth foreshore and Kings Park to see this year's fireworks.

For those who did brave the conditions, the reward was spectacular.

One reveller said the display was 'absolutely fantastic, worth getting wet for'.
