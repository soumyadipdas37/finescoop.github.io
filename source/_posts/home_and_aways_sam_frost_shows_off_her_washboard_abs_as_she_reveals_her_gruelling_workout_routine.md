She's the resident beach babe in Summer Bay. 

And on the weekend, Home and Away star Sam Frost revealed with fans how she keeps in such great shape. 

The 31-year-old shared on Instagram her gruelling workout routine, as she flashed her washboard abs in a crop top. 

Keeping fit! At the weekend, Home and Away star Sam Frost showed off her washboard abs in a crop top as she revealed her gruelling workout routine that targets the booty and core

'Little biddy of a core sesh today, specific details on my IG story,' Sam captioned one photo of herself at the weekend, as she lifted a dumbbell. 

In the image, she stunned as she showed off her toned physique in a black crop top, high-waisted leggings and a cap. 

According to Now to Love, Sam revealed her favourite exercises to target the core and the booty. 

Working hard for her figure: For the booty, she does four sets of exercises including squat jumps, step-ups and donkey kicks. For the abs, she does four sets of exercises including kettlebell side bends and planks

For the booty:   

4 sets:

20x squat jumps

20x glute bridges with a weight

12x dumbbell step-ups on chair (each leg)

12x donkey kicks (each leg)

12x single leg deadlift with a dumbbell (each leg)   



For the booty, she does four sets of exercises including squat jumps, step-ups and donkey kicks. 

For the abs, she does four sets of exercises including kettlebell side bends and planks.

Sam previously spoke about how she stays fit, telling Women's Health in March last year that she mixes it up as she gets 'really bored at the gym.'

'I exercise probably three times a week, but I get really bored at the gym, so I always have to mix it up,' Sam said. 

'I do a lot of core. I hate doing legs, but I deal with it.'

She added: 'I do boxing classes – I feel like a boss when I do it – HIIT, barre, tennis and trapeze sometimes.' 

In February last year, Sam told WHO magazine that she worked out daily, eats a strict Rachael Finch-inspired diet and only occasionally enjoys a 'cheat meal'.

'I try to do 20 minutes of workout every day, but realistically, I do them every second day,' Sam told the publication.

12x plank pull through with a kettlebell

30x Russian twists with a medicine ball

12x sit-ups and press with a medicine ball

12x hand to foot pass with an exercise ball 



She added that she performs circuit-style training and does various exercises, including sit-ups, squats and push-ups.

In addition to this, she enjoys a boxing class or spin class up to twice a week.

The former radio presenter also revealed her day on a plate, explaining that breakfast is usually a berry smoothie with protein and a coffee.  

She has roasted vegetables and an egg for lunch, and dinner typically consists of grilled chicken or fish with vegetables and rice.

Fruit is her snack of choice if she's feeling hungry in-between meals.

Despite following a 'clean' diet, she still indulges in a burger every now and then.
