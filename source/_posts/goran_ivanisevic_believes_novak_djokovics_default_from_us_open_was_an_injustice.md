Novak Djokovic is to make a quick return to action next week, with his co-coach Goran Ivanisevic describing his US Open default as an injustice.

The former Wimbledon champion, who was courtside when he was disqualified for hitting a female line judge with a ball, believes there should have been more leniency shown and a game penalty awarded.

'As soon as I heard her sighing I knew that was it,' he told Serbian publication SpotKlub. 'Okay if there is intention to harm someone, but this was a complete accident.

His co-coach Goran Ivanisevic says his punishment after striking a line judge is an injustice

'Yes there are rules but taking into consideration that Novak didn't have any intention, and with corona and everything, they shouldn't have defaulted him.'

Ivanisevic criticised what he felt was a sense of schadenfreude in some part of the tennis world after his player's demise.

'What I find tragic is that many people act like they were just waiting for him to do something wrong. There is a lot of maliciousness and a lot of people happy that someone else is in trouble. Some of the media are out to get him and I really don't know why that is.'

Djokovic has travelled to Rome and will play in next week's Italian Open, where he will be accompanied by long-time mentor Marian Vajda.
