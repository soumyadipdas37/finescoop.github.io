This was a resurrection from the dead unprecedented in Premier League history. Even Fergie time didn’t extend beyond the final whistle. The game was over, the final whistle blown. Solly March’s 94th minute equaliser, turned it at the far post, had rescued a wholly deserved point for Brighton. In fact, a draw still felt like a travesty; a 5-2 win for Brighton might have been fair.

So referee Chris Kavanagh signalled the end of the game and March, scorer of that late equaliser, was being congratulated by his team-mates for clearing the ball off the line from Harry Maguire’s header, a last gasp corner being all United had to offer.

Yet, as the players headed to the dressing room, Maguire was adamant: there had been a hand ball en route to goal. A fight almost ensued, as the Brighton players protested. This would feel like an injustice too far. Surely the final whistle is the marker of that your job is done. 

Bruno Fernandes scored a penalty with the last kick of the game as Manchester United stole all three points against Brighton

Solly March poked home at the far post inside stoppage time and appeared to have secured the hosts a share of the spoils

No longer. As soon as Kavanagh started his walk to check the monitor, the outcome felt inevitable. And there it was, clear as the midday sun in Sussex; Neal Maupay lifting his arm to deflect the ball. Still, Bruno Fernandes had to step up and finish the job, which he did, cooly lifting the ball into top right hand corner. And United had their win. And yet how they had laboured for it.

With a week’s more conditioning and a Carabao Cup win behind them, here was an opportunity to put down a marker and make a significant improvement on last weekend. Yet for United it was more of the same in that opening 45 minutes. In fact, it was perhaps ever worse.

Graham Potter’s 3-4-3 simply cut through Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s midfield three, frequently leaving Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes and Nemanja Matic looking heavy legged, plodding after their rivals. That may be fitness. But it could just be that Brighton were better coached and using the space more effectively.

Wave after wave – appropriately on the south coast – of Brighton attacks left United looking impotent. Three times Brighton hit the woodwork. Twice it was Leandro Trossard denied , initially on ten minutes and then again on 21 minutes. Both times he had turned quickly and slipped away from the United defence and De Gea was well beaten. The third let off for United came when they failed to clear a free kick – and United conceding fouls in dangerous areas was a persistent feature of the half – and Neal Maupay drilled in a cross for Adam Webster to head against the bar.

So even when Mason Greenwood had a fine goal, created by the quick feet and skill of Martial disallowed on 33 minutes – Rashford was marginally offside in the build up – it never felt like United were likely to impose themselves.

And there was no shock when their sluggishness saw them caught out, Wan Bissaka initially losing the ball, which was worked over to Tariq Lamptey to drive into the box to be felled by Fernandes. 

Lewis Dunk's own goal helped United level the scores on the stroke of the break after a goalmouth scramble just yards out

Harry Maguire was able to challenge Dunk and the Brighton centre back inadvertently tucked beyond his own goalkeeper

United captain Maguire wheeled away in celebration with his team having hauled themselves level before the half-time break

Neal Maupay had opened the scoring for the hosts with a cheeky penalty following Fernandes' clumsy trip on Tariq Lamptey

The Brighton striker cheekily lobbed the spot kick into the roof of the net to hand Graham Potter's men the lead on 40 minutes

Already on a yellow card, the Portuguese midfielder was lucky to stay on. Maupay took the penalty responsibilities, chipping the ball delightfully over De Gea in an impudent Panenka-style strike.

United looked lost so more fool Brighton for inviting them back into the game, conceding a 43rd minute free kick which Fernandes whipped into the far post. Matic turned it back in, Maguire stuck out a foot and a deflection off Lewis Dunk made it 1-1.

Within a minute of the restart, United seemed to have thrown that fortuitous fightback away, Aaron Connolly falling as Pogba shadowed him in the box. A VAR intervention ruled that Connolly had tripped over his own feet rather than Pogba’s. Shortly afterwards the VAR was called on again to rule out Rashford’s strike from Greenwood’s cross for offside. 

Keeper David de Gea was unable to stop the penalty and has now conceded from the spot in both of United's opening fixtures

United star Fernandes endured a tough opening 45 minutes and was left baffled by the decision to hand Brighton a penalty

Solly March had struck the inside of the far upright with Brighton denied a second goal by the woodwork on four occasions

The home side were awarded another spot kick just seconds after the restart when Aaron Connolly tangled with Paul Pogba

Yet that at least was a sign of United stirring. On 54 minutes, finally they would demonstrate some of the quality they do possess. As is so often the case under Solskjaer their best moment came as a counter attack. Fernandes as deep in his half when he picked out the space in front of Rashford with an exquisite pass. 

Once it was a foot race between the United man and Ben White, you sensed Brighton were in trouble, Twice Rashford turned inside White and twice landed him on his backside before sizing upo his spot and scoring. If the performance in general had been lamentable, the goal at least was delightful.

Still, there was danger aplenty. Solly March drove a shot across goal to hit the post. On 76 minutes, as Brighton switched played brilliantly from right to left it looked as though Trossard would finally have his moment. But his shot rose so that it thudded off the bar, the fifth time Brighton had been denied by post or bar. In the closing quarter, March was denied by a Wan Bissaka block and then volleyed well over when presented with another fine chance. And it took a fine save from de Gea to deny Trossard – again - from close.

On another day, this might have been a famous victory by a considerable margin. As it was, Brighton took the plaudits but United the points. 

Referee Chris Kavanagh was advised to check his decision using the VAR screen and soon overturned the divisive spot kick

Was Kavanagh and VAR correct to award United a spot kick?

Incredible drama as Man Utd beat Brighton with 99 minutes on the clock 😮The referee had blown the final whistle, only for VAR to award a penalty for a clear handball...Bruno Fernandes buries it to win 3-2. pic.twitter.com/CP7bKhGLn7

Good grief. What a game we have just been treated to on the south coast. The record books will read a Manchester United win but it's been 100 minutes full of drama. What a shame it couldn't be played out in front of fans. 

Well where to begin? Brighton and Graham Potter will be completely devastated with how the game transpired after Solly March scored what we all thought was a last-minute equaliser. It was a deserved leveller with the Seagulls enjoying the better of the chances, striking the woodwork four times.

But a moment of madness from Neal Maupay, who scored a superb panenka penalty earlier in the first half, handed United a lifeline on a silver platter and Bruno Fernandes is a player not to squander an opportunity from 12 yards. His spot kick was brilliant and United have kickstarted their league campaign with an important three points. 

Bruno Fernandes makes no mistake and wins the game for Manchester United! A brilliant penalty.

The penalty is given and Brighton can have no complaints. Bruno Fernandes has the chance to pull off what would be daylight robbery here.

90+7mins: Big chance United! The visitors have a corner, Maguire rises highest and nods across goal and March clears off the line!

But what's this? United are calling for a penalty and it looks like Neal Maupay has clearly handled the ball there. This could be devastating for Brighton.

And Brighton have got the goal they so richly deserve!! The Seagulls work the ball really well around United's penalty area. Jahanbakhsh sends a cross over and March is free as a bird at the back post and nods the ball into the ground and it hits the back of the net! 

United players are distraught at letting their lead slip, hands on knees all over the place.

90+4 mins: United well and truly parked in their own box as they look to hang onto what would be their first league win of the season.

90+3 mins: Big chance Brighton! A corner is cleared but Brighton send another cross over, the ball fumbles into Trossard's path. All he needs to do is put it either side of David de Gea but the attacker pokes it straight at the goalkeeper who saves with his knees.

90+1 mins: Brighton have five additional minutes to get the goal they very much deserve here.

90 mins: Brighton win a free kick on the right as Gross steps up to swing another cross into the United danger zone. Jahanbakhsh wins the header but Kavanagh blows his whistle for a free kick in United's favour. 

United make their final change as new boy Donny van de Beek comes on for Anthony Martial. 

87 mins: Brighton have another corner. Can they make this set piece count?

The ball is fired over, Dunk rises highest and the ball goes over. The Brighton captain is fuming because the ball actually came off Anthony Martial.

86 mins: March has had several glorious opportunities this afternoon but has done everything but score. The ball is chipped to the back post where the winger is arriving but he slices the volley and it balloons over.

Potter a frustrated figure on the touchline. 

That is absolutely brilliant by Marcus Rashford 🔥Man Utd's number 🔟 takes things into his own hands after a brilliant ball through by Bruno Fernandes!Sat the defender down twice... pic.twitter.com/wgEcrFuab1

83 mins: Dunk is booked after bringing Rashford down as United looked to counter. 

Solskjaer makes his second change as Greenwood makes way for Eric Bailly. They've switched to a back three to close out this game. 

80 mins: All Brighton here. Another shot for March 10 yards out is deflected off Wan-Bissaka and goes out for a corner. Gross to take. Delivery is terrible and United counter through Rashford and Martial but Brighton have enough players back to slow the visitors down. 

79 mins: United have dropped off and look really leggy heading into the final ten minutes. With Martial, Greenwood and Rashford still on the pitch they'll be looking to hit Brighton on the counter. 

78 mins: Brighton recycle possession and Trossard plays a reverse ball for March, whose curling effort bends beyond De Gea's goal. The Seagulls are knocking at the door for an equaliser.

77 mins: Brighton hit the woodwark AGAIN! You have to feel for Trossard, he's hit the left post, the right post and the crossbar as he absolutely leathers a shot that De Gea has no chance of saving but it crashes off the bar and United clear.

75 mins: United break forward through Luke Shaw and the full back is brought down by White who goes into Kavanagh's book. 

Graham Potter makes a double change as Pascal Gross comes on for Adam Lallana while Jahanbakhsh is on for Connolly. 

Fernandes to take the free kick. The delivery is cleared away and it comes to nothing.

71 mins: The pace has slowed slightly now, with United content to knock it around and move Brighton from side-to-side. 

United burst into life as Fernandes plays a delicate reverse pass into the path of Martial, the Frenchman takes an exquisite tough but Ben White is across to poke the ball away from the striker. An inch-perfect tackle. 

68 mins: Really good work from the tenacious Maupay who drives past a host of red shirts and screws a shot at goal, but De Gea is down to collect the fierce effort.

66 mins: Solskjaer makes his first change as Fred replaces Pogba in central midfield. United looking to shore things up with a defensive option.

64 mins: March is having a really good afternoon on Brighton's left. He goes one-on-one with Greenwood, fires a cross in and Lindelof turns it behind for a corner.

The corner is poor, though, and Luke Shaw heads it away.

61 mins: Brighton hit the post again! Brilliant work from the hosts as Lamptey and White open up United and the ball is worked across to March. He strikes at goal and De Gea has no chance but the ball rattles the post and United survive. 

59 mins: Connolly gets the better of Harry Maguire and goes down again but Kavanagh says no penalty. VAR takes a look and backs up the referee's decision. United are frustrated by the livewire striker who is causing them problems this afternoon.

57 mins: Lewis Dunk, Ben White and Adam Webster have all had to pay to get back in after being well and truly deceived by that Rashford skill, and Brighton will have to muster a fightback to get back into this game. 

55 mins: Manchester United take the lead! It's an exceptional counter attack as Bruno Fernandes sets Marcus Rashford free down the left. 

The forward chops inside on his right foot, lines up a strike at goal and sends all three Brighton defenders to the shops for a pint of milk, pulls it back onto his left foot and buries it into the top corner.

A beautiful individual goal from Rashford.

53 mins: Well then, it's been a pretty lively start to this second half hasn't it? This game is poised very nicely indeed.

52 mins: Marcus Rashford has the ball in the back of the net and gives United the lead! Lovely ball from Greenwood and the England striker makes no mistake.

But wait, VAR is having a look and Rashford is clearly offside. The goal is chalked off.

48 mins: Kavanagh has taken a look at the pitchside monitor and has found that he made the wrong decision.

Strikers have perfected the art of initiating contact and winning penalties, but in the age of VAR, referees have the chance to make sure the penalty decision is accurate. 

On reflection, it would have been harsh on Pogba and United for Brighton to receive a second penalty of the afternoon.

47 mins: It's ANOTHER penalty for Brighton! Connolly is through on goal and has Paul Pogba chasing. The striker steps across the Frenchman so as to initiate contact, which he gets, and he goes down for the penalty. VAR has told Kavanagh to look at the screen...

46 mins: Brighton get the ball rolling and the second half is under way. Neither side have made a change but Solskjaer will be expecting a big improvement from the eleven out there.

This is how you panenka, folks. 

How cheeky is that from Neal Maupay? 👀The Brighton striker pulls off a perfect panenka after Bruno Fernandes gave away a penalty. pic.twitter.com/BjH67zE9uZ

And that'll do it for the first half here at the Amex Stadium. Graham Potter will be very pleased with the performance of his side in the opening 45 minutes, with Brighton the better of the two teams.

The Seagulls were deserving of their lead when Fernandes gave away a clumsy penalty and their confidence was best showcased through Maupay's spot kick, who oozed composure with a perfect panenka. 

Fernandes responded well to the disappointment of hindering his side, though, putting in a wicked free kick that was eventually turned in by Lewis Dunk.

Solskjaer will not be pleased with that first half showing, but the good news for United is it's still level. They'll have to improve if they want to take away all three points come full time.

45+2 mins: Brighton have another chance to get the ball in the box towards their giant centre halves. March steps up but Kavanagh blows his whistle for a foul by Alzate against Maguire. 

45+1 mins: Two minutes of added time now.

45 mins: United have their tails up as Matic lines up an effort on goal and Matt Ryan is required to push the ball down in front of him and collect.

United are level! Fernandes fizzes the ball into the box towards Matic at the back post, the Serb knocks the ball back across goal and Harry Maguire is there to poke home. He is claiming it although it looks like Lewis Dunk got the final touch. 

42 mins: United have a free kick in a dangerous area after Luke Shaw is brought down by Trossard after a positive bursting run forward. Trossard is booked for that.

Fernandes lining up the free kick. 

41 mins: Meanwhile, play resumes and Matic is booked for pushing an arm into Maupay's face.

Neal Maupay scores! And it's a superb penalty from Brighton's No 9. He steps up, cool as a cucumber and executes the perfect panenka, with De Gea left to look very silly as he dived to his left. 

Confidence is oozing through the Brighton striker.

38 mins: Brighton have a penalty! Adam Lallana plays the ball into the path of Tariq Lamptey, who is on the charge into United's penalty area. Bruno Fernandes is following the youngster and clips his heels and Kavanagh points to the spot. 

VAR confirms that the referee made the correct decision.

Maupay with the chance to put Brighton into the lead...

37 mins: Connolly has a chance to run one-on-one with Lindelof but he can't get his touch right and the Swede pokes the ball away from the striker and United recover. 

35 mins: Another corner for Brighton as Maguire just gets ahead of Webster to flick the ball behind for a corner after another Seagulls free kick. Webster is a big threat from set pieces today.

Solly March puts an inswinging ball over but no Brighton player can meet it and it runs out for a goal kick.

33 mins: Greenwood has the ball in the back of the net but the linesman's flag is up for offside! Superb intricate play from Martial and Rashford sees Greenwood picked out in front of goal and he makes no mistake in burying it beyond Matt Ryan.

However, Rashford was offside in the build up and the goal is chalked off.

Just a glimpse there of what United can do. 

31 mins: March is thriving down the left now. Wan-Bissaka and Pogba make a mess of things, the winger nips in and fires a low ball across the six-yard box but no Brighton player has gambled on it and United avert the danger.

30 mins: Chance Brighton! Now Brighton have a free kick in United's third after a foul by Wan-Bissaka on March. March takes and Maguire flicks it away, Maupay lobs it back in and Webster rises highest and nods a header onto the crossbar!

28 mins: United are back on the ball but Brighton, in their defensive five, look a robust outfit and are asking United to cut through them.

United have a set piece, though, with Fernandes ready to take. The set piece is glanced away by Lamptey and the hosts regroup. 

25 mins: Brighton gaining momentum as Maupay wins a corner for the hosts. Lallana is running the show through the middle, using his experience to help this young team against United's side full of superstars. Lamptey has looked bright on the right too. 

De Gea parries the corner away and United avert the danger once more.

22 mins: Bruno Fernandes is the first to go into Kavanagh's book after a clumsy challenge on Neal Maupay. The United bench is not happy that a free kick was not awarded in their favour for an earlier foul on Matic. 

21 mins: Chance Brighton! And it's Trossard who again is given acres of space outside the area. He shifts the ball onto his left foot and fires a low effort across goal that hits the outside of De Gea's post and goes wide. Big let off for United.

19 mins: Brilliant work from Bruno Fernandes there. The Portuguese cuts in from the left onto his right foot. He whips a ball into the danger zone but Martial can't get on the end of it and the ball curls wide for a goal kick.

18 mins: Brighton play through the thirds and Solly March is in space down the left hand side, looking to arrow a ball into the box. His cross ricochets off Lindelof and lands straight in the arms of De Gea.

17 mins: Chance United! Lapse in concentration from Tariq Lamptey sees the youngster play a square ball across his own area. Greenwood pounces onto it but hooks the ball wide of goal. 

Inexperience from the youngster told there.

15 mins: Quarter of an hour into the game and Brighton have looked very sharp, albeit haven't caused too much concern for United, barring that Trossard chance.

United have been caught in possession on occasion and seem to be going through the motions at the moment.

13 mins: More poor play from Fernandes sees Brighton break on United again. This time Maupay lines up a strike on goal but it crashes off a United defender and De Gea collects. 

Lamptey bursts forward and Matic cynically brings the youngster down for a Brighton free kick, 20 yards from United's penalty area.

Maguire is up to clear Solly March's lofted ball into the box and United regroup. 

11 mins: Sloppy play from Fernandes allows Brighton to break on United. They're three-on-two through Trossard but the attacker takes too long to release the ball and the visitors have enough back to thwart the danger.

10 mins: Chance Brighton! Leandro Trossard is afforded acres of space outside the United penalty box. He cuts across the ball with a fizzer of an effort that strikes De Gea's post and crashes wide. 

Encouraging signs for Potter's side. 

6 mins: United looking to get Fernandes on the ball, with Rashford and Greenwood making direct runs from the flanks in a bid to get beyond the Brighton back five. 

Brighton have it up the other end with Leandro Trossard. His low cross is just cut out by Lindelof ahead of the onrushing Maupay. 

4 mins: Brighton win a corner after Neal Maupay pinches the ball off Nemanja Matic and runs at the defensive pairing of Maguire and Lindelof. His cross is cut out and goes behind for a set piece. It;s blustery at the Amex, so could prove tricky for David de Gea.

The corner is poor and Luke Shaw is up to clear away for the visitors.

2 mins: United looking to set the pace from the outset, something they struggled to contend with against Palace last week, and force Brighton to lose possession in their own half on two occasions in these opening stages.

Paul Pogba looks for Rashford with a searching ball over the top but Brighton clear.

Chris Kavanagh blows his whistle, the players take the knee in support of the Premier League's anti-racism message and Bruno Fernandes gets the ball rolling and we are under way in today's lunchtime kick off.

The players are out and we're moments away from kick off in the first Premier League fixture of Gameweek 3.

Can Manchester United respond from their surprise defeat last weekend to Palace? Brighton are a tough prospect and Solskjaer will be hoping for a serious improvement if United are to clinch all three points. 

Graham Potter: It was a nice result but it doesn't count for much today. The boys are looking forward to it against one of the best teams in the league.

We have played a lot of the top teams, and we have had draws, that statistic can be out there, our challenge is to try and win today, the past is the past, we focus on the now.

He [Lallana] has been great for us, how he plays, and how he interacts with the rest of the players and his decision making.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: We knew we were a couple of weeks behind,we looked a bit short, we weren't ready from the start, we have had a good week and a good game against Luton. We should be ready.

This team played really well here last year, they weren't ready last week but hopefully they are ready to perform.

The centre-backs last week. They did anything but set their stall out. They were slow and cumbersome. There were so many different mistakes. It was terrible to see and it disappoints. This is an area I have spoken about for many, many months, and it has not been addressed.

He [Solskjaer] could show them the Europa League semi-final and last week. I think you look at Liverpool, they bought Alisson to solve their goalkeeping issue and Van Dijk for their defence, Man United have not done that [addressed their issues at the back], it is not an issue that emerged the other day.

I want Jadon Sancho, he is a generational talent and would get fans off their seats, but does he solve the fundamental problems I see with this team? There are moments before games when the opposition, are they looking across and saying they are going to have to be at their best to score past this Man United defence? I don't think so.

He's been superb since arriving at Brighton from Chelsea earlier this year, and Tariq Lamptey will be looking to wreak havoc down United's left side this afternoon.

David De Gea was momentarily the hero but was left to rue the intervention of technology as VAR determined his foot was off the line when he saved Jordan Ayew's tame penalty in the defeat by Crystal Palace.

With Dean Henderson hunting down the starting spot between the sticks, the Spanish stopper will be hoping for a flawless afternoon on the south coast. 

Solskjaer had a selection dilemma in whether to hand new boy Donny van de Beek a starting role after his strong cameo against Palace. 

Fans have been purring for a Pogba-Van de Beek-Fernandes midfield combination, but Solskjaer has opted for defensive solidity in Matic.

Sportsmail's ADAM SHERGOLD looked at why a midfield trio of Pogba, Van de Beek and Fernandes might expose United's frailties.

A reminder of the last time these two met, 12 weeks ago. Solskjaer will be hoping for more of the same today.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer bemoaned a lack of preparation time and said that a number of omissions from his team for Palace was due to a shortage of fitness among his players.

But he's reverted to the team that provided the swashbuckling, thrilling football that launched United into the top four last season.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka returns at right back in place of Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Nemanja Matic comes into midfield in place of Scott McTominay while Mason Greenwood joins the forward line in place of Dan James. 

Brighton boss Graham Potter, meanwhile, names former Liverpool star Adam Lallana in his starting XI, who replaces the suspended Bissouma.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side got their 2020-21 campaign off to the worst possible start last week, as United were deservedly beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace at Old Trafford.

They'll be looking for a bounce back but face a tough task in a Brighton side with their tails up. 

Stay tuned as we bring you build-up towards our live coverage of the lunchtime kick off. Team news to come shortly.
