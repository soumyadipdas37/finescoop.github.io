Izzy Sharman-Firth has certainly moved on from Locky Gilbert.  

The Queensland glamazon, 29, who was evicted from The Bachelor during this season's penultimate episode, looked absolutely smitten as she stepped out for a date night with new boyfriend Rhys Murtha on Sunday. 

Izzy couldn't wipe the smile from her face as she posed for a series of photos with her beau on Instagram.

'Swapped group dates for double dates,' she wrote alongside a photo of the pair with friends.

Izzy appeared head over heels for her new man as he planted a kiss on her cheek in another photo.

All glammed up for the occasion, the reality star wore an orange mini dress and black stiletto heels.

She completed her look with a full face of makeup, and allowed her blond tresses to fall loosely in curls.  

During her elimination interview on The Project on Thursday, Izzy revealed she found love since signing up to the Channel 10 dating show.

 'I'm extremely smitten. I'm very much in love!' she giddily told the show's panelists.

So in love: Izzy made her new relationship 'Instagram official', sharing a series of photos with her new beau on the social media app on Thursday

Izzy also made her new relationship 'Instagram official', sharing a series of photos with her new beau on the social media app on Thursday.

'And outside the mansion,' she captioned them, including a photo of herself and her new boyfriend gazing at each other adoringly.

While she didn't reveal her beau's name or give details about their relationship, Izzy also shared a video of herself giving him a quick kiss on Instagram Stories.

During her appearance on The Project, Izzy was also asked about her mum, Christina, who shocked viewers when she asked Locky, 31, for his sperm during Wednesday's home visit. 

While Izzy wasn't in the room during the awkward moment, she said she doubted that her mother was being serious. 

'I wasn't there in the moment so I heard about it when we were having dinner after that and I thought mum was joking to start with - she was joking, just to clarify!' she laughed. 

She added: 'She was joking, she has a funny sense of humour. I don't think she meant it.'
