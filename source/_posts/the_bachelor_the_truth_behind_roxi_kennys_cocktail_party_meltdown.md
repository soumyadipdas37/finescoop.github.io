Bachelor viewers were up in arms on Wednesday after Roxi Kenny burst into tears at the rose ceremony for the fourth time.

And on Thursday, evicted contestant Laura Calleri defended her co-star's weekly emotional meltdowns.

The 24-year-old marketing coordinator told News.com.au: 'I definitely think all the tears are warranted.'

She explained that The Bachelor was a stressful environment and everyone reacted differently to the emotional pressure.

'When there are that many girls, that many personalities, you're bound to respond in a different way than you normally would,' Laura said.

'Unfortunately, [Roxi] just really let hers out and cried a lot,' she added.

Laura added that news of the coronavirus pandemic had shaken the mansion and sent tensions soaring at the cocktail party.

But that didn't stop viewers flocking to Twitter to vent their frustration over Roxi's hysterical reaction to seeing Bella Varelis kiss Locky Gilbert on Wednesday's episode.

'You have a rose Roxi, calm down,' tweeted one viewer, while another wrote: 'Didn't Roxi just kiss Locky like an hour ago? Why is she upset?'

'Uh, it's called The Bachelor, not the Roxi Drama show,' commented another.

A fourth tweeted: 'Roxi needs to chill out. What did you think was going to happen on The Bachelor?' 

In a piece to camera later that night, Locky defended his decision to kiss two women on the same day.

'There's a process, I'm not trying to hurt anyone, but I am trying to find the person I want to spend the rest of my life with,' he said.

'Roxi, yes, I should have been more respectful of you, but... There's 15 girls here, and I've got connections with other girls besides you. And I'm sorry for that.'

After their conversation, a remorseful Roxi said: 'I mean, I always get over s**t. And I wake up the next day, I'm, like, "Okay. Like, it's fine."'

Earlier in the episode, Roxi and Locky had enjoyed an intimate date, during which they shared a kiss and she received a rose.

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
