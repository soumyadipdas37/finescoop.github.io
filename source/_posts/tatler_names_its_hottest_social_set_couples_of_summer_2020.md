Society bible Tatler has unveiled its hottest couples from the Social Set this summer, including royal pairings, chocolate heiresses and modelling socialites.

While some couples have stepped out in public for the first time by taking lavish trips across the continent, others cemented long-standing commitments by staying at one another's family piles during lockdown.

Royals including Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and her new beau Hon. Peregine Pearson were declared 'the hottest new pairing of the summer', while Talita von Furstenberg and her boyfriend Rocco Brignon are described as 'getting serious' during lockdown. 

Other blue-blooded couples on the list include Princess Margaret’s grandson Arthur Chatto and university girlfriend Lizzie Friend, as well as Jemima Cadbury, the great-great-great-granddaughter of confectioner John Cadbury, and her beau David Tollemache, the nephew of Lord Tollemache. 

Here, FEMAIL reveals the hottest couples to have emerged out of lockdown after a summer of love...

The great-great-great-granddaughter of confectioner John Cadbury has been dating David Tollemache, the nephew of Lord Tollemache, since 2016.

The couple regularly share snaps of their adventures around the world on Instagram, visiting snowy Amsterdam in January and St Barth last August.  

The quirky socialite and chocolate dynasty scion Jemima is part of the Chelsea social set, living just off Sloane Square.

David and Jemima recently celebrated her birthday at the neighbourhood's new hotspot, Stanley's, with the heiress affectionately calling her boyfriend 'Tolly.'

The blue blooded couple have been together for several years, and often share snaps of their adventures on Instagram (pictured left, in Amsterdam and right, at a wedding)

She launched lifestyle website Bee Bazaar was launched in May 2018, revealing: 'The site connects people with the fun things happening in London. Things that I and my friends would want to do — something cultural and artistic.

‘So many of my friends have companies and exhibitions and launches that you never hear about. I got the website up and running to connect young people to cool brands.’ 

Meanwhile David's relatives Lord and Lady Tollemache live close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the ancient, vast and moated Helmingham Hall, where the Queen is a regular overnight guest.

Their two sons are both true Turnip Toffs: banker Edward, Prince Charles’s godson, and his wife, Sophie, have two young sons; and fund manager James, who was at Eton with William, is married to Princess Florrie von Preussen (of Prussia), who used to style for Oka, the upmarket interiors label owned by Samantha Cameron’s mother.    

Lady Amelia Spencer and Greg Mallett

The society beauty, 28, who is the daughter of Earl Spencer and first cousin of Princes William and Harry, met her real estate beau while they were both studying at the University of Cape Town.

She stayed on the estate with boyfriend Charles, his parents and his four siblings. 

In May, the Duchess has given a very public seal of approval to model Ella, by selecting her to star in the campaign for her new nightwear collection.

Having been raised in Los Angeles, Talita relocated to the East Coast in 2017, when she started attending Georgetown alongside her cousin, fellow royal Prince Alexios of Greece.

She and boyfriend Rocco were living in New York, where Talita is set to begin her final year at NYU, at the onset of the pandemic, and moved back to Malibu to stay with her parents.

The couple recently enjoyed a romantic getaway in Europe, travelling to the south of France before driving down to Portofino.

Talita recently told FEMAIL that travelling through Europe with her beau has made them 'a lot closer and a lot more serious'

Despite dating for several years, Tatler reports the couple 'started to get serious' this summer, spending their holiday driving across the continent.

Earlier this month, Talita told FEMAIL that being together 24-7 in lockdown has been 'challenging', but has also made them stronger.

'It's been fun for us, it's definitely made us a lot closer and a lot more serious since we've literally been 24-7 together,' she said - adding that wedding bells are 'in the very distant future' for the young couple.
