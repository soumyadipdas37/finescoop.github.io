Australia's confectionery brand Allen's has given its iconic Snakes Alive lollies a sour makeover that's set to tantalise taste buds.

The new snakes will be soft, juicy and stretchy just like the original lolly - but will have a 'sensational sour twist'.

The classic fruity flavours of zesty lemon, strawberry, blackberry, pineapple and apricot will remain, but have been transformed with a sour coating.

'Snakes Alive are a long-time favourite amongst lolly fans, so we have combined this with the power of sour to blow Aussies away with these tasty new lollies,' Nestlé head of marketing confectionery Joyce Tan said.

'We can't wait to see lolly lovers nationwide pull their best sour face when they try the new Sourz Snakes Alive - we're sure they're going to be a huge hit.'

The new product will join the range of iconic lollies including Snakes Alive, Red Frogs, Strawberries & Cream and Party mix bags.

The Allen's Sourz Snakes Alive will be available nationwide in Woolworths for $2.95 a pack this month.

The sweet treats are made at Nestlé-owned Allen's Lollies factory in Broadford in central Victoria, about 73km north of Melbourne.

In early 2017, it was revealed a whopping 240 million snakes are made in one year or 3,000 tonnes of the lollies.
