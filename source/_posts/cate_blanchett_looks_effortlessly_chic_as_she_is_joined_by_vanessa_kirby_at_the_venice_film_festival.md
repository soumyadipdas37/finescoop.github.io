She is currently acting as the Jury President for the 77th annual Venice Film Festival.

And Cate Blanchett looked radiant as ever as she walked the red carpet alongside Vanessa Kirby ahead of the closing ceremony of this year's festival on Saturday.

Cate is heading the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.

'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she added of her thoughts on the matter.

'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.'

Cate's recently revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'.

Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor.

'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.'
