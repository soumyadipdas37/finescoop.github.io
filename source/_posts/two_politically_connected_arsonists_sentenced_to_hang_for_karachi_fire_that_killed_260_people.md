Two men have been sentenced to death for arson after a court in Karachi found them guilty of starting Pakistan's deadliest industrial fire, killing 260 people in 2012.

The men set fire to a garment factory after its owners didn't pay extortion money, the court found.

The arsonists, Abdul Rehman and Zubair Charya, were affiliated with the MQM party, a large national party which was governing in the city at the time of the attack.

Hundreds were trapped inside the factory during the blaze and the building had no fire exits.

Officials initially thought the inferno was an accident but it later was revealed to be an arson attack. 

The instigators were sentenced to be hanged but no date has yet been set for the execution.

Of the eight other people accused in the case, four were found complicit while the other four were acquitted, including the then provincial minister for industries, Rauf Siddiqui, defence counsel Abid Zaman told reporters outside the court.

Around 40 fire engines tried to tackle the huge blaze when it broke out in September 2012.

Workers were seen jumping from high windows in the horrifying scenes as the fire took hold.

Dead and injured people remained inside with the fire still raging 24 hours after it started. 

Fire chief Ehtisham-ud-Din said most of the garment factory deaths were caused by suffocation as people caught in the basement were unable to escape.

The garment factory, Ali Enterprises, supplied many clothes to the US and Europe.

Workers manufactured denim, knitted garments, and hosiery, and had capital of between $10 million and $50 million. 

The arsonists belonged to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a secular political party in Pakistan founded in 1984.

The party has been linked to years of violent political rivalry in Karachi and a faction is now a partner in Prime Minister Imran Khan’s coalition government.   

The current MQM leadership denies any involvement with the fire and says such activities were directed from abroad, where several important leaders live, including the founder of the party, Altaf Hussain, who lives in exile and is now a British citizen.

The party says it has cut all ties with Hussain.
