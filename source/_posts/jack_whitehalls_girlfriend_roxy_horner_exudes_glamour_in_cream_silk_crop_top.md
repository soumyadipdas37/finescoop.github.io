Roxy and Jack are said to have made their romance exclusive just before the UK-wide coronavirus lockdown.

The comedian shared his first Instagram post with the model and even posted a funny video of her giving him a quarantine haircut earlier this year. 

A source told The Sun at the time: 'Jack and Roxy are enjoying being in isolation together. It's all very new but they're in their own little bubble and things are perfect at the moment.

'Being on lockdown in a honeymoon period is certainly one way to get to know each other quickly. But the more time they spend together the happier they seem.  

'Both have had their share of heartbreak and struggled a bit to find love. It's time they had some luck.'  

Roxy has a string of famous exes, having previously been linked to A-list actor Leonardo DiCaprio and singer Jake Bugg who she split from in December.

Jack has been linked to various women since calling it quits with actress Gemma Chan, 37, in December 2017 after six years together. She is now in a relationship with screen star Dominic Cooper.
