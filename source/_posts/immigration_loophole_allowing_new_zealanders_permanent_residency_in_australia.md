New Zealanders are able to get permanent residency in Australia due to little-known immigration loophole.

Kiwis who came to Australia on a New Zealand passport before September 1, 1994 can get the Resident Return Visa (RRV) for just $405. 

Travellers who visited Australia before that date were automatically given permanent residency, which allows them to apply for their residence status again.

The RRV is an online option for Kiwis who then came back to Australia after February 26, 2001

They can then apply to become Australian citizens without forgoing their New Zealand passport. 

They will be able to legally vote and access the National Disability Insurance Scheme and benefits if they are unemployed. 

The RRV is an online option for Kiwis who then came back to Australia after February 26, 2001. 

New Zealanders who have earned less than $53,900 for all four income years can apply for permanent residency, which is necessary if they want to become citizens.

Nerang Neighbourhood Co-ordinator and Kiwi campaigner Vicky Rose has been contacted by hundreds of Kiwis in Australia who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic and didn't know if they were eligible for emergency subsidies. 

'It's (RRV) not a well-known visa but one that will enable New Zealanders who don't qualify under any other visa, a window of opportunity to become an Australian permanent resident and then have a pathway to Australian citizenship,' she told the Gold Coast Bulletin. 

Ms Rose warned that the application process is complicated, but there is help available online.

Applicants are asked to give details of home ownership, family and business connections in Australia.

They must also provide 'compelling' reasons as to why they returned to New Zealand, including divorce, deaths, marriage or no work opportunities.  

Ms Rose said she joined the Australian Labor Party to fight for ways to make it easier for New Zealand migrants to become Australian citizens.  

'I will be actively aiming to get a commitment from the ALP to a direct pathway to Australian citizenship for New Zealand migrants,' she said.
