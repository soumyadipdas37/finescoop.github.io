She is preparing to imminently welcome the latest Love Island baby. 

And Camilla Thurlow proudly showed off her pregnancy curves in her latest Instagram post with dad-to-be Jamie Jewitt.

The 31-year-old reality star wore a figure hugging pale grey dress that revealed how her baby bump has grown, which she matched with a knotted dark grey cardigan. 

Parents to be: Camilla Thurlow proudly showed off her pregnancy curves in her latest Instagram post with dad-to-be Jamie Jewitt

Jamie, 30, looked suave in a navy leather jacket, a midnight blue T-shirt and jeans. 

Clearly ready to embrace the next stage of their relationship together, the happy couple grinned from ear to ear as they placed their arms around each other. 

Revealing how far along she is, the 2017 Love Island star captioned the post: 'Lovely lunch for my younger sister's 27th birthday #36weeks'.   

Not long now: Camilla revealed in the caption just how far along she is

Excited: The happy couple revealed they are expecting a baby over Instagram back in May. Camilla later revealed there's been 'ups and downs' with her pregnancy, but she's 'very happy'

Camilla's post comes after she admitted talking to Andi Peters on Lorraine that there have been 'ups and downs' with her pregnancy, but that she's 'very happy'.

The star also discussed struggling to open up to people after working as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in Afghanistan and Cambodia.

She said: 'The biggest part of it is about the work I did with the [charity] Halo Trust.

'Before Love Island that was the work I liked doing and I was lucky enough to travel to Afghanistan and Cambodia, and during that time I learned a huge amount. 

'As I travelled across several different countries, it changed in different places, but the work was majority in landmine clearance.

'You might clear land that can then be used for people to farm land for food for their family. Every country had different challenges, but it was an amazing experience.'

Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World

The memoir is not just about finding the courage to go out and deal with lethal threats at work, but the courage to confront one's own fears and anxieties.

How it all began: Jamie and Camilla met on Love Island 2017 and have been going strong ever since
