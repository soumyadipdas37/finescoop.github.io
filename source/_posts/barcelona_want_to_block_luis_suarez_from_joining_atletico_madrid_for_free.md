Barcelona are attempting to put the brakes on Atletico Madrid's deal to sign striker Luis Suarez by adding their rivals to a list of 'vetoed clubs' he can't sign for.

It appears the Uruguayan has no future at Barcelona beyond this summer, with the club trying to clear him from their wage bill, but Nou Camp chiefs are reportedly being very specific about who he can and can't sign for.

Marca report that Barcelona are trying to add Atletico Madrid - the favourites for his signature - to a list of 'vetoed clubs' that he can't join, alongside Real Madrid, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.
