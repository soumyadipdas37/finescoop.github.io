Speaking about telling Kerry's five children before getting down on one knee, Ryan explained: 'I thought it was the right thing to do.

'Everyone was excited, everyone was on board. It was lovely in that respect. I went to pick the ring with DJ and Heidi. I think Max was asleep at the time.'  

Kerry said she couldn't believe DJ didn't tell her. 'For a six year old, she did really well. Crafty that one, I'll watch out for her!' she laughed.

Gentleman: Speaking about telling Kerry's five children before getting down on one knee, Ryan explained: 'I thought it was the right thing to do.

Carol McGiffin then asked Ryan what he would have done if the kids had said no and Ryan revealed: 'If it was the youngest three, I would have brainwashed them with a McDonald's, the older two, harder work.

'But yeah, I don't know really. I get along so well with them all so I kind of knew it was going to work… I'm really happy about it.'

Discussing why this marriage will be different, Kerry said: 'Before, it's always been about a wedding, I don't want a wedding, I want a marriage. Ryan's my partner, my life partner. I feel like this is how it should have been the first time and second… and third time around!.

'I can still pull 'em!' It comes after Kerry shared the moment Ryan proposed in Spain ahead of her 40th birthday

 'The past is the past. Just because I've been married and divorced and I've got five kids with three dads, doesn't mean I don't deserve to be happy… I'm really happy and I'm in love.'  

For Kerry, this will be her fourth marriage. She was previously married to Brian McFadden, 40, Mark Croft, 49, and late ex-husband George Kay.   

In an interview with New Magazine, the couple hinted they could well tie the knot in a Las Vegas wedding. 

Showing his apparent aversion to lavish nuptials, Ryan said: 'To me, weddings have always been overrated. I've never been a fan of the big, white wedding. 

'I always knew if I was going to do it, I'd want to hop on a plane and do it in Vegas in a chilled-out way.'
