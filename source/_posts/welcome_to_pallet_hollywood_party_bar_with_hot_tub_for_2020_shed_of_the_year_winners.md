A retired party planner is celebrating after her summerhouse triumphed in the Cuprinol Shed Of The Year 2020 awards.

Jane Moyle, 77, uses the bright and airy space in her back garden to entertain friends and her 11 grandchildren.

It's a subject the pensioner from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, knows plenty about after a successful career as an organiser of VIP corporate events.

Jane (pictured) took inspiration from Japan in creating her ultimate summerhouse. What started as somewhere to store photo albums soon blossomed into a space for entertaining her friends and 11 grandchildren

'In my career I used to put on events for some of the biggest companies in the world, so that came in handy when designing the summerhouse,' she said.

'I initially conceived it as a lovely restful place that my husband and I could relax in, and somewhere where I could display some of the photographs I love to take.

'With the folding doors and the decking outside, it is ideal for outdoor meals, sunbathing and reading.

'But now it gets just as much use from my grandkids who range in age from 11 to 28. They have a lot of fun in there when granny isn't around.

'We live in the centre of Cheltenham but when you're in the summerhouse it feels like you're in the country.'

There were nine categories for this years competition and Jane triumphed in the 'Summerhouse' category after she decided to renovate the shed.    

The summerhouse has been designed to the highest spec complete with sunbeds, sink, fridge for garden parties, books, and ample space to store sports equipment

It was originally built as a Japanese summer house but was never finished off by the previous owners.

Determined to pick up from where they left off and complete the job, creative Jane lovingly restored it into a luxury summerhouse, complete with sunbeds, sink, fridge for garden parties. 

The grandmother originally wanted to create the space to store her treasured lifetime of photographs which she now intends on putting into order. 

Judges have been blown away by the imagination and creativity on display from sheds up and down the country during these unprecedented times but it was Jane's shed that impressed them

Croquet sets, badminton nets, boules, are also stored in the summerhouse ready to play with as soon as the urge arises. 

The space is a haven of peace and tranquillity, which considering it is in the middle of a large town is often wondered at by Jane's friends.

Head Judge and competition founder Andrew Wilcox said: 'This year we've been blown away by the imagination and creativity on display from sheddies up and down the country, during these unprecedented times.

'Jane's stylish summerhouse impressed us with its sophisticated design and the fact that it brings so much joy to so many generations.'

The sophisticated design of the shed appeals to multi-generations and creates a little countryside sanctuary in the centre of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

Kirsty Woodbine, Marketing Manager for Cuprinol, said: 'The extraordinary events of this past year have seen the nation's sheds take on a host of new roles in our lives - from a family refuge to a sheducation hub.

'It highlights how creative and considerate we can be even through the most difficult of times.

'Now more than ever our gardens, patios and outside spaces provide welcome respite from the uncertainties of the world outside - allowing us time to reflect, relax and socialise.

The public voted for their favourite shed through readerssheds.co.uk who were mesmerised by the grandmother's imagination and creativity

'At Cuprinol we're committed to helping people make the most of the outdoors so they can enjoy all the benefits getting closer to nature brings.'

Shed of the Year is a celebration of the great British shed in all their forms. 

From the miniature to the massive, the modern to the traditional, the cosy to the minimal and everything in between - sheds of every shape, size and function are entered into the annual competition. 

This year's entrants competed across nine categories - with two new lockdown-specific categories introduced - Lockdown Repurpose and Lockdown New-build. 

 Each winner was decided by the public voting through readerssheds.co.uk

Budget Category: Winner Julie Twydell (pictured) kept busy during lockdown by working on her Budget Pallet Hobbit House which has been made entirely from recycled materials

Julie Twydell won the Budget Category Winner for her Budget Pallet Hobbit House which she says kept her sane during lockdown.

The Marketing Manager from Bromley, Kent said: 'If I didn't have it, I'm not quite sure what I would have done instead,' she says.

Made entirely from recycled materials Julie reveals: 'Nothing is really straight, correct or perfect and that's what I love about it. 

I like its rustic charm. I can read there, have a glass of wine, watch TV with the cinema screen, do craft and building projects - it's great.'

Pub/Entertainment Category: Winner Mark Killick (pictured) used old wooden pallets to create his Pallet Hollywood bar in the back garden of his home in Farnborough, Hants

Pub/Entertainment Category Winner Mark Killick used old wooden pallets to create his Pallet Hollywood bar in the back garden of his home in Farnborough, Hants. 

It boasts a hot tub and a stash of original 80s vinyl to play on his Kenwood Hi-fi system. 

He said: 'Before the lockdown, friends and family would come round for a few drinks at Pallet Hollywood. 

'We've got music in there and have had some great parties, and with all the outside lights on every evening it's great to look at when we're in the house.'

Unique Category: Winner Adrian Backshall (pictured) The Eastbourne sheddie built the Old Bill shed on rails inspired by his life-long passion for trains

Adrian Backshall's life-long passion for trains inspired the Eastbourne sheddie to build the Old Bill on rails. 

The retired 59-year-old train worker said: 'From when we bought our first house I've always had a shed. 

I've collected lots of old railway stuff over the years and wanted to reuse it for the shed. It's kept me busy in my retirement and I've had it all to myself, but I've spent so much time and money on it I thought it was worth showing off.'

Lockdown New-Build Category: Winner Joe Melton  kept boredom during lockdown at bay by building this homemade rum shack named Rk2 in his back garden in King's Lynn, Norfolk

Norfolk sheddie, Joe Melton, kept busy during lockdown by building this homemade rum shack in his back garden. The Senior Project Manager from King's Lynn, explained: 'The bar has brought us together during lockdown as we have continued to make changes and improvements. 

'The whole family has been involved in building, sanding and waxing - giving the children a chance to learn new life skills and then enjoy slushies sitting back looking at what they have built.'

Workshop/Studio Category: Winner Colin Furze kept his army of 10 million Youtube subscribers entertained with his creations in his Colin Furze Workshop in Stamford, Lincs

YouTube star Colin Furze keeps his ten million subscribers entertained with his creations in his workshop in Stamford, Lincs. 

He said: 'My dad never let me in his shed. So once I moved into my own house the shed was the first thing I did. 

'The shed is not just a workspace or place of work, it is now an inspiration for the many people that watch my videos to see what can be made in a garden workshop. 

'I get a lot of messages from people and parents of children who've been inspired to get making their own creations and even make their own sheds based on mine.'

Unexpected Category: Winner Len Lavelle built this replica of a traditional Irish boozer as a tribute to his cherished dad and named it Bucko's Bar

For the Unexpected Category Len Lavelle, 51, built this replica of a traditional Irish boozer as a tribute to his cherished dad. 

The Quality Control Manager from Heald Green, Cheadle said: 'My dad brought us up with all the traditional Irish values, and whenever we went on holiday to Ireland we would find ourselves spending most of the time sitting in the corner of an old Irish Pub. 

'I will never forget the day that I invited him and the rest of the family round for him to cut the ribbon and officially open the bar. 

'It was a great afternoon, and each and every item inside the bar reminded him of his past and he had many tales to tell.'
