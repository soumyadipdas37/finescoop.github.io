Stevie Wonder was pictured leaving Nobu in Malibu on Wednesday night after celebrating his beloved son Kailand Morris's 19th birthday. 

The singing sensation, 70, cut a low profile while leaving the restaurant, wearing a face mask as he headed into his car. 

Nobu appears to be a favourite haunt of the father and son because Stevie treated Kailand to a family dinner there back in June, to celebrate his graduation.

Proud Stevie had appeared in high spirits at the family dinner, which was also attended by son Mandla, 15, and the boys' mother, fashion designer Kai Milla.  

While out, Kailand caught up with iconic photographer David LaChapelle.

Last year, Stevie's son interned with Kim Jones at Dior Men's during Paris Fashion Week.

Meanwhile, in July last year, Stevie revealed that he was due to have a kidney transplant in September and had a living donor lined up. 

However, he has not yet revealed if the operation has taken place.

The chart-topper told fans of his condition as he wrapped up his set at British Summer Time in London's Hyde Park last summer. 

'Ha-ppy graduation to you!' In June, Stevie adapted his iconic Happy Birthday song to serenade son Kailand in Nobu as he celebrated his graduation

Finishing his song, Superstition, he had said he wanted to clear up rumours about his health.  

He told the crowd: 'I'm all good, I'm all good, all good, I have a donor and it's all good.

'I want you to know, I came here to give you my love and thank you for your love. I love you and God bless you.'
