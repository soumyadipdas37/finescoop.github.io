A Kmart worker stole at least $76,000 worth of Lego products from the store so he could fund his gambling habit.

The staffer pleaded guilty to fraud, stealing as a clerk and servant and possessing tainted property at Southport District Court on Friday.

He was caught stealing items such as high-end Lego sets to sell on Gumtree - where he had made $25,000 in 22 months, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

The court was told the store noticed Lego items missing during a stock take and an investigation was launched.

Police searched the 34-year-old home in March 2019, and he admitted to stealing from the store for 22 months.

The man told police it was to fund his gambling habit, the court was told.

Officers also found a device to remove security tags and 15 security tags that would have been attached to stolen items, the court heard.

The man lost his job after his crimes were discovered, and he had been working as a support worker until a deterioration in his mental health. 

Nick McGhee, the man's lawyer, said his client had a gambling addiction and was now seeking help for it. 

Judge Katherine McGinness sentenced the Kmart staffer to three-and-a-half years in jail.

The sentence would be sentenced after he had served his months.
