Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster wants to hold talks with Crystal Palace about a transfer.

The striker is the subject of interest of a host of clubs including Palace, Sheffield United and Aston Villa.

As reported by The Sun, Palace is the 20-year-old's preferred destination as he considers what the best step will be for his career.

Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster wants to hold talks with Crystal Palace about a move

Brewster, who started out at Chelsea's academy, is eager to return to London. 

After scoring 11 goals in 22 appearances on loan at Swansea last season, Brewster was hopeful that he would be afforded an opportunity to impress at Liverpool.

Palace are eager to secure a deal for Brewster, who could cost £20million plus add-ons

Liverpool and manager Jurgen Klopp want a buy-back clause included as part of the deal

However, the Reds are prepared to let him depart, with Palace attempting to secure a fee that could rise to £20million plus add-ons.

Liverpool want to include a buy-back clause in any deal for Brewster but Palace are reluctant to comply with that request. 

Brewster has made just four competitive first-team appearances for Liverpool and breaking into the side at Anfield was always going to be extremely difficult with Roberto Firmino ahead of him.
