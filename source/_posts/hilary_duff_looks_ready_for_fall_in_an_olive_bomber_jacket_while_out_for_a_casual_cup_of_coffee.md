Despite the blazing heatwave burning its way across Southern California, Hilary Duff appears to be ready for fall.

The 32-year-old Lizzie McGuire star was spotted stepping out for a hot cup of Joe in a casual autumn look in Los Angeles on Monday.

Hilary has been hunkering down during the coronavirus pandemic with her two kids, eight-year-old Luca and one-year-old Banks.

The blonde beauty rocked a casual chic look for her Labor Day coffee run in a block top and a pair of black leggings.

She topped her look off with an over-sized shiny olive green bomber jacket and upped the fashion factor another level with a trendy pair of Balenciaga slip-on trainers.

Hilary's undone platinum locks were left down in beachy waves and she sported a large pair of dark sunglasses.

The busy mom appeared to be solo on her outing, with her two kids likely back at home, where they've been spending quite a bit of time due to the pandemic.

It's back to school for her third grader, Luca, whom she shares with ex-husband Mike Comrie.

Duff was wed to the professional hockey player from 2010-2016. She went on to spark up a romance with musician Matthew Koma and the couple tied the knot last year. 

Duff recently posted a sweet selfie with her boy and shared an update on social media: 'My guys is getting an expander and starting 3rd grade!!!!!! SOS it’s going too fast! Slow down the tape!'

Last month she opened up about her experience in lockdown with her two kids and husband during a press appearance on Australia's The Morning Show. 

'I feel really lucky,' she quipped. 'We've had a lot of great family time together that we normally wouldn't have. My husband is a touring musician; I split my time between east and west coast.'

It seems her youngest, Banks, is already taking after her father. Koma recently shared a sweet post on Instagram of the toddler playing the drums - or, at least, trying to.

Meanwhile, Hilary is supporting a good cause in the midst of fire season and a blazing heatwave in Los Angeles.  

'Fire season is here. We know how quickly a fire can grow and devastate communities. Let’s help the LAFD by getting safety gear + essential tools into their hands,' she penned on social media.

'The @lafdfoundation is raising funds for these much needed items by selling LAFD Strong t-shirts like this one! You can learn more about the LAFD Foundation and purchase a shirt at SupportLAFD.shop!'
