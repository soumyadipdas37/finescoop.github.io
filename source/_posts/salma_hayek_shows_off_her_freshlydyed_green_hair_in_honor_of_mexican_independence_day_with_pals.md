Earlier this month, she opened up about feeling 'invigorated' by the way directors are approaching her for roles in her 50s.

'It really invigorated me that they are finding me. I always found them. But they didn't want me. And that now they're coming to me, that's what's been really invigorating,' the beauty told OK! magazine.

She noted: 'It's difficult to make sense of it, you know? But that's what's been really strange. And you know what? Strange things happen to strange people.'

In the past few years the actress has starred in Drunk Parents, Like A Boss and The Roads Not Taken. Next she will be seen in The Eternals, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard and Bliss. 

Hayek rose to fame in the Mexican telenovela Teresa before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a big screen career.

However, when the Hollywood actress first started out in 1988 she had no idea how things would end up. 

Better now: Salma Hayek feels 'invigorated' by the way directors are approaching her in her 50s. The 54-year-old movie star started her career trying to get the attention of filmmakers and convince them to cast her in their movies, but after 32 years in the industry, she is delighted they are finally approaching her for roles

She believes any struggles over the years have given her the possibility to choose the right path, having dubbed her life 'completely unimaginable'.

The cover girl explained: 'The things that have happened in my life are completely unimaginable. Even in my greatest ideas of my most extraordinary destiny, I never imagined how I feel right now.

 'At some point in your life you just settle for doing the right thing and the best you can, instead of think about what you want and what you can didn't get get or what you're not getting or how someone's getting it and you're not getting it.

Looking caliente! Hayek shared a new swimsuit photo to Instagram on Tuesday as she said the image was not a flashback. And the wife of billionaire François-Henri Pinault added that the next day she would be turning 54-years-old

'It gives you the possibility to take roads that you never wanted to take, and you have the adventurous spirit to go and discover instead of planning so much. You may end up on roads that are much better than in your imagination,' the wife of billionaire François-Henri Pinault concluded. 

Salma and her French businessman husband have been married since 2009, after tying the knot in a lavish Paris ceremony on Valentine's Day. Their nuptials are said to have cost an eye-watering $3.5 million. 

Their big day took place in the famous Venice opera house Teatro La Fenice, and the lovers were joined by an A-List group of well wishers, including Penelope Cruz, Woody Harrelson and Bono.
