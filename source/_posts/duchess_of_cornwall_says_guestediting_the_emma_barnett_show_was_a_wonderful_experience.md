The Duchess of Cornwall has called her recent guest-edit of The Emma Barnett Show a 'wonderful experience' in a touching note written to a royal fan. 

Camillam, 73, took on her first-ever radio guest edit on the BBC Radio 5 Live programme in July where she opened up about life in lockdown and some of her work with her patronages. 

Royal fan @GertsRoyals has now revealed a thankyou letter sent by the Duchess after she took her time to send birthday congratulations and praise her for her appearance on the show. 

In the note which was shared on Twitter, the Duchess wrote: 'Thank you for your kind letter about my recent Guest Edit of the Emma Barnett Show. I am so glad you enjoyed the programme. It was a wonderful experience, and I was delighted that so many of my charities, including SafeLives, were able to participate.'

She went on: 'I do hope you and your family have been safe and well during this challenging time.' 

The duchess appeared to have personally signed the note in black ink, finishing the note: 'With best wishes, Camilla.' 

Her distinctive solo royal monogram - boasting her initial C and a coronet - featured at the top of the letter.

The personalised letter differs from Camilla's birthday thankyou note which was revealed earlier this month by a different royal fan, and features an unseen photograph of the Duchess.    

In the letter, which was shared by royal fan @GertsRoyals online, Camilla said she hoped everyone was 'safe and well during this challenging time' 

The card included a snap of the duchess casually dressed in jeans with a blue sweater over a pink shirt, while posing on the steps outside her Scottish home of Birkhall.

Capturing Camilla reading All Change by Elizabeth Jane Howard, the photo was originally released by Clarence House in April when the royal shared her favourite reads for Easter. 

Katharina of @katsroyalletters shared the card, which included the message: 'Dear Katharina, thank you so much for remembering my birthday. This year, of all years, your kind message was especially appreciated and very cheering.'

In July, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall thanked royal fans for sending letters during these 'difficult and uncertain times'.

Charles, 71, and Camilla sent cards of gratitude to supporters who had taken the time to send their congratulations on the couple's wedding anniversary in April.
