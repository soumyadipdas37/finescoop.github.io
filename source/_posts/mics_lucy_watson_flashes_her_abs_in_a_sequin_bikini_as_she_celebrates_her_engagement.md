She announced her engagement to her boyfriend of five years, James Dunmore, on Tuesday. 

And Lucy Watson was still on cloud nine as she shared a bikini snap from the couple's romantic Greek getaway on Instagram on Friday.

The former Made In Chelsea star, 29, displayed her washboard abs in a grey sequin two piece, while captioning the image: 'Sparkles to match my mood.'

The reality TV personality displayed her golden complexion as she reclined on a lounger under the Mediterranean sun.   

Earlier in the week, the brunette beauty shared a sweet image next to her beau, 31, on a romantic boat trip and wrote in the caption: 'here’s to forever,' accompanied by an engagement ring emoji. 

Toasting to the occasion with glasses of champagne, the vegan restaurateur enthused she was having 'the best day ever' as they watched the sun set.

Lucy looked stunning in a brown bikini as she kissed and cuddled shirtless James on the watercraft.  

The reality star's younger sister Tiffany, 26, congratulated the pair on their holiday engagement, and commented: 'SO HAPPY. Congratulations both of you.'

Her former MIC co-star Nicola Hughes, 30, added: 'I’ve been ecstatic all day. SO HAPPY.'   

Where it all began: Lucy and James have been going strong since meeting on the E4 series in 2015 following her ill-fated flings with Andy Jordan, Jamie Laing and Spencer Matthews

Lucy and James have been going strong ever since meeting on the E4 series back in 2015.

Prior to her relationship with her husband-to-be, Lucy's ill-fated flings with Andy Jordan, Jamie Laing, Spencer Matthews and Oliver Proudlock all featured on the show.

The loved-up duo left the show just a year after embarking on a relationship and bought their first home in London in August 2017.

They spent nearly 12 months renovating their Victorian home, an experience Lucy previously insisted was 'great' for their romance.
