Brian Austin Green appears to be back on with tattooed bombshell Tina Louise, after the pair were caught enjoying a beach date on Monday. 

And the Australian model, 39, proved she couldn't be happier about it, by sharing a slew of raunchy bikini shots on Instagram after being seen with the American star.  

Tina, who boasts 2.4 million followers on the social media platform, revealed almost every inch of her incredible figure in the skimpy swimwear.

The bronzed beauty posed in a skimpy peach-hued bikini top, which showed her ample cleavage. 

She paired the top with high-cut turquoise blue bikini bottoms that revealed the intricate tattoos which cover her body. 

The beauty finished her look with silver jewellery, along with white rimmed square sunglasses. She let her blonded tresses flow freely.

Tina posed in a range of positions, including one with her hand over her torso and fiddling with her strap in the photos. 

She captioned the post: 'Needed this', along with a blue heart emoji.  

Tina was seen enjoying a beach date alongside beau Brian Austin Green earlier in the day.

During their outing, Brian could barely keep his eyes off the stunning model. 

Brian reportedly split with Tina at the end of July after a month of dating, before the pair were seen looking cosy.   

The former TV star has since caused controversy with former wife Megan, 34, by mocking her gushy social media posts with her new rapper boyfriend, Machine Gun Kelly, real name Colson Baker.

The sighting comes just days after Brian told his Instagram followers he would 'never say never' about getting back together with Megan. 

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he said during an Instagram Live on Saturday.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he added of Fox, who started dating rapper Colson less than a month after their split. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'

However, last month, trouble started when Megan posted a sexy mirror selfie of herself and Colson with the caption: 'Achingly Beautiful Boy... My heart is yours.'

The public display of affection appeared to be too much for her ex Brian, who threw shade just hours later by posting a snap of their three sons with the similar caption: 'Achingly beautiful boys..... my heart is yours.'   

Brian and Megan share three children together Bodhi, six, Journey, four, and Noah, seven, while he also has another son Kassius, 18, - who features in his post - from his previous relationship with actress Vanessa Marcil.
