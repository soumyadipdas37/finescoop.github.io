The reality star responded: 'I didn't. It was a slow burner. But this is VERY different to any relationship I've been in before. 

'It puts most of my others to shame and I can't believe what I put up with to how well I am respected and how loved I feel now. 

'It puts everything into perspective when someone treats you right.'
