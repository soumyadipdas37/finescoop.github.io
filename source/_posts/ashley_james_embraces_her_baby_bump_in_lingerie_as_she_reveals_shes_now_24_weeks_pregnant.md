Ashley James declared she's 'never felt sexier' in her body as she revealed she's now 24 weeks pregnant.

In a radiant clip uploaded to Instagram on Monday, the DJ, 33, embraced her baby bump in lingerie as she shared an update with her social media followers.

The influencer star wrote in an accompanying caption: 'I wanted to show off some of the lingerie I got from a little independent boutique in Notting Hill, because honestly I feel so much more myself and confident with a drawer full of beautiful lingerie.'

The media personality revealed her baby boy, who is due in January, is a 'little raver' who tends to keep her awake at night.

Former Made In Chelsea star Ashley went on to discuss the physical effects of pregnancy, insisting that while her chest 'stings like crazy' if she gets cold, she's 'never felt sexier'.

The body confidence advocate went on: 'I love my bump body! I can't believe my babe has grown eyelashes (and a willy) inside of me. Watching him grow bigger has given me a new appreciation for the miracle that is my body.

'That said, I'm starting to notice the pain in my back, especially since my pregnancy scare. I get get to enjoy my first pregnancy massage this week and had acupuncture last week.

'Still, I can feel it's going to get a little harder to move this boy around, as my back aches if I walk around or stay standing for too long. 

'I feel more confident with dressing. I definitely want to start sharing some of my 'non-maternity' maternity outfits, because I feel like I've finally figured it out, for now at least.'

The empowerment coach said during an appearance on Jeremy Vine: 'At the beginning we were laughing at the baby boom but now we're part of it.'

Ashley confessed her boyfriend was initially more excited about the prospect of starting a family, but she's now happier than ever and has already built their unborn baby's gender-neutral safari-themed nursery.

Ashley explained: 'I wouldn't say I'm a naturally maternal person. He always said he'd want a big family and I told him I don't know if I want that. But now, I'm so excited and I've basically done the nursery now in lockdown. 

'It wasn't like a contract in which he told me that he'd leave if I didn't give him a family, but I think authenticity in relationships is nice, he's from an amazing family and he's really great with children.'
