Nineties supermodel Cindy Crawford and Casamigos co-founder Rande Gerber's son Presley 'is doing better' since his rebellious streak, and it's partly due to the coronavirus quarantine keeping him out of trouble.

'Being able to spend so much time with close friends and family during the lockdown has been beneficial for him,' a source told Us Weekly on Thursday.

'His family was really focused on getting him the help he needed...He's been able to get his act together more.'

The heavily-tattooed 21-year-old alarmed his family after having 'misunderstood' inked on his face, and he remains on probation through 2022 after pleading no contest to one misdemeanor DUI stemming from a January 1, 2019 arrest.

Presley might have found emotional stability due to his relationship with Sydney Brooke, with whom he adopted purebred Sphynx cat, Mr. Beaglesworth.

Gerber still lives in his parents' Malibu guesthouse, and he works in the kitchen of his 58-year-old father's nearby Cuban restaurant Café Habana.

In July, the Brentwood-born blond formed a mysterious duo called Fairy God Bros. under the moniker 'Prezzy' with 35-year-old rapper Shwayze.

Presley - who's registered with DNA Model Management and IMG Models - hasn't had a paid modeling gig since serving as a brand ambassador for Arianna Huffington's app, Twenty, in April 2019.

Back in 2016, Gerber told French Vogue he wanted to study business in college and that he sees himself in 10 years: 'Living in NY, owning my own bar/club, and following in my dad's footsteps.'
