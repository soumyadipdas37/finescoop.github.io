A judge said he came under 'improper' pressure to keep alleged criminals – who have waited months for a trial – in jail.

Judge Keith Raynor publicly criticised the Government last month when he ordered a suspected drug dealer to be released from jail while awaiting trial.

Earlier this week he said not enough had been done to make sure trials are heard more quickly. 

Judge Raynor said his superior at Woolwich Crown Court put him under pressure by highlighting to him advice on plans to make up the backlog of cases in the criminal courts.

He said he was 'subjected to improper and undue influence' – and has now been removed from a hearing on custody time limits.

Justice Secretary Robert Buckland this week extended the time that a suspect can be held before trial to eight months.

The row follows tension among lawyers over delays to trials during the coronavirus crisis and worries that accused men and women are being kept on remand in prison for far too long before their cases come to court.

Decisions on which judges should take which cases are taken by senior judges under the supervision of the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and are jealously guarded from interference by politicians or other outside influences.

The was no comment on the row from Lord Burnett yesterday.
