They're both portrayed British Queens on the big and small screens during their successful careers.

And now Olivia Colman and Dame Judi Dench are set to see who can rule the charts when they both release musical projects on November 6, reports The Mirror.  

The Crown star, 46, is set to narrate a poem to music while Dame Judi, who has previously acted as Queen Elizabeth I and Victoria, will sing on Aled Jones' album.

 Oscar winner Judi, 85, will show off her vocal talents alongside Welshman Aled to song How Can I Keep From Singing.

Called Blessings, the album will touch on different faiths including Quaker, Christian, Catholic, Muslim and Buddhism, reports Classic FM.

And as well as Dame Judi, other guest stars appearing on the album include Susan Boyle and Brian Blessed.

While Olivia's voice will feature on album Carnival which will feature classical music by the Kanneh-Mason and poems by Michael Morpurgo.

The War Horse author wrote a series of new poems inspired by Saint-Saëns’s The Carnival of the Animals which the talented family put to music.

One of the Kanneh-Mason siblings, Sheku, is already well-known for his skills after he played at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding. 

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Dame Judi and Olivia for a comment. 

Dame Judi and Olivia have worked together in the past with them both appearing in 2017 film Murder on the Orient Express.

And this is not Olivia's first time featuring in the recording industry as she also appears on a 2019 Children in Need album, covering Portishead's Glory Box.

However, the actress wasn't too confident about her singing abilities at the time, joking: 'I think I should definitely stick to my day job.'

Also appearing on that album with Olivia was Helena Bonham-Carter, 53, who took on Joni Mitchell's song Both Sides Now. 

The actresses have also been working together on Netflix series The Crown, in which they play sisters The Queen and Princess Margaret.

Each star has handpicked their cover song so that it is significant to them for the album.
