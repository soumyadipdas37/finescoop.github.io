They are engaged to be married after meeting on the set of The Inbetweeners while playing Tara Brown and Simon Cooper on the hit Channel 4 comedy.

And Hannah Tointon and her fiancé Joe Thomas were spotted making a rare outing together in London on Saturday afternoon together.

The Festival actress, 32, opted for dressed down style as she sported a zip-up jumper with a navy wax jacket and a pair of grey straight leg jeans.

She styled her ensemble with a pair of chunky black biker boots and a tan leather handbag, while keeping her head warm with a navy beanie.

Inching out from underneath her hat, Hannah wore her blonde locks in a loose straight style and appeared to go make-up free for the outing.

The star toted her belongings in a reusable canvas carrier bag.

Meanwhile, Joe, 36, also looked casual in a grey sweatshirt which he wore with mustard chinos and a pair of white trainers.

He was also rocking a black jacket and cap, while covering his face with a mask and carrying to paper bags in his hand.

In 2018 the couple starred in summer comedy The Festival together, and at the time Joe told Christine Bleakley on ITV's Lorraine that he loved working with his fiancee again, eight years after their first worked together.

He quipped: 'I've got to the stage like she's in everything, it went very well I think!'

In January earlier that year, UniLad reported Joe got down on one knee after seven years with Hannah.

Their love no doubt blossomed after their characters embarked on romance on the show - with the sister of Kara Tointon playing unlucky-in-love Simon's crazy girlfriend Tara.

Having more luck with their love off-screen however, it was confirmed that the duo had moved in together in the City back in 2012.

While he's known for his comedic roles, Joe says he tries to separate work and home life, explaining:

'I guess I do try and switch off when I get home, if you're doing comedy all day sometimes you want to be calm, I'm trying to introduce the word chilled into my vocabulary.'
