Channel Nine's Tony Jones has made a startling admission that he has a bizarre phobia about eating cereal.

The 58-year-old broadcaster, who is currently the sports presenter of Nine News Melbourne, made the wacky admission in a Q&A. 

Speaking on Nine News Unmasked, Tony revealed: 'I can't stand people eating cereal,' he said, looking sheepish about the phobia.

'Even when I eat cereal, this is true, I go into the laundry room.' 

Appearing on the show alongside colleagues Peter Hitchener and Livinia Nixon, Tony struggled to explain the odd behaviour. 

'So you stand next to the ironing board eating cereal?' Livinia asked.

'I know. I know. My wife and daughter and son are like you are sooo,' he said, refusing to repeat what they call him. 

Peter and Livinia agreed that talking to a person while eating is a pet hate. 

'Apples. Apples drive me crazy,' Livinia said.

Peter said he doesn't love it when people are drinking while he is trying to engage in conversation with him. 

'I've been careful to turn my back from Tony while I'm in the studio,' Peter said, so as not to annoy Tony. 

Tony appeared at a loss to explain the behaviour, but made sure to explain that he took ownership of his quirks. 

'Don't say that. You make me sound like a ogre,' Tony said during the exchange, with the three presenters playfully laughing over his quirks

'Don't say that. You make me sound like a ogre,' Tony said. 

It was clear the three presenters are great friends with most of Tony's harmless quirks treated with a polite ribbing by his colleagues. 

Tony previously worked on the Today show as the sports reporter, but resigned following the controversial revamp last year.
