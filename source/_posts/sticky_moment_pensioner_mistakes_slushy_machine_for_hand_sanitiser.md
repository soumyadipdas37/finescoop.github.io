A well-intended pensioner mistakenly used a slushy machine for hand sanitiser while entering a petrol station.

Security camera footage, which appears to have been filmed on September 15 in an unidentified petrol station, shows the mask-wearing elderly man enter the station at 3.47pm.

The man notices the slushy machine containing blue and red liquid at the entrance and begins to pump the sticky liquid onto his hands believing he is sanitizing his hands.

The mask-wearing man enters the station at 3.47pm and scans the store for a hand sanitiser before making a beeline for the slushy machine

During the clip, the pensioner diligently walks into the petrol station and makes a conscience effort to socially distance from other customers.  

He then makes a beeline towards the machine containing two clear containers of blue and red liquid and pours the sticky substance onto his hands. 

After rubbing the ice cold slush onto his hands he walks further into the shop. 

Following the comical clip, which has since received more than 19,000 views online, viewers took to social media to share their amusement. 

One user said: 'Aww bless him. The world is just so confusing for everyone at the moment.'
