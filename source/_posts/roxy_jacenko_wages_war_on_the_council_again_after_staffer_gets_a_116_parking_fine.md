Roxy Jacenko is waging yet another war on Sydney City council after her staffer was hit with a parking fine near her Paddington office. 

On Tuesday, the 40-year-old shared a photo to Instagram showing the $116 infringement along with a long caption ranting about the perceived injustice. 

She wrote:  'This is just a disgrace. I've written to City of Sydney about the parking situation in Paddington - without even a reply some two months ago.

'Weekly my team who just try and come to work by means as directed by the government (driving not using public transport due to Covid-19) get parking fines - today's fines a mere 20 minutes over? 

'Hard enough to keep business running let alone having to run out every hour on the hour. Interestingly this ticketing is targeted to two streets only by our office - enough is enough.

'Shame one has to stoop to using social media in order to get an answer as a land tax paying building owner in their area. As with others, I'll be covering this for my team, as why should they be penalised for getting up and going to work.'

Ouch: On Tuesday, the 40-year-old shared a photo to Instagram showing the $116 infringement along with a long caption ranting about the perceived injustice. She wrote, 'This is just a disgrace.

Upset: Roxy also posted an earlier letter she sent to the council over a similar issue. 'Somethings got to change. @cityofsydney @clovermoore (my original letter is in my story)' she wrote

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to City of Sydney for comment.  

The Sydney PR queen is no stranger to the odd parking fine - nor is she known for backing down when there is roadblock in her way.

After Roxy's $250,000 Range Rover was pictured parked in a No Stopping zone outside her Paddington office in April last year, the unflappable entrepreneur was ready to wage war with the council. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Roxy said: 'It's ridiculous that the No Stopping zone is there when two cars can easily fit into this space by my garage'. 

'I will be applying to have that No Stopping area re-zoned for parking. The Council has failed to provide parking spaces for all buildings and businesses in the area.'  

Roxy went on to complain that lack of parking has negatively impacted businesses in the area other than her own.

'People wonder why Oxford St Paddington has died and are quick to blame Westfield. Far from fact, maybe if people could park they would come to the area and the street and businesses would once again thrive!' she added.   

The comments came after Roxy's $380,000 set of wheels was seen parked illegally outside her Sydney offices, which run alongside Oxford Street, for many months, Private Sydney reported in April 2019.    

City of Sydney Council has confirmed parking in the stopping zone carries a fine of $263. 

Fined: In March and November 2017 she received a fine for the same offences, with the latter hitting her for an eye-watering $257 (pictured)

The following year, The Daily Telegraph reported Roxy was handing out merchandise in front of a No Stopping sign at Bondi Beach. 

Any fine copped by Roxy would likely be pocket money for her, given her purchase of a $6.5million in Sydney's Vaucluse.
