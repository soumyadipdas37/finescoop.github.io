They all starred in the fifth season of Love Island last summer.

And Maura Higgins, Joe Garratt and Chris Taylor proved they're still the best of friends as they headed for dinner together at Sheesh in Chigwell on Sunday night. 

Irish beauty Maura, 29, flashed her toned abs in a satin crop top as she left the popular Essex eatery.

She teamed the glamorous silver strappy number with a pair of high-rise ripped jeans and nude heels for the dinner out.

She accessorised with a white leather handbag and wore her brunette tresses in a top knot while showing off her trendy new fringe.

Chris, 28, looked dapper in a black t-shirt and black and white checked trousers while Joe, 23, opted for cream chinos and a grey shirt.

The group of friends looked in high spirits as they left the restaurant laughing and larking around. 

Maura and Chris' outing together comes after last month she spent an evening out with him and then returned to his house that night with an overnight bag.  

The pair reportedly went back to his house at 11:15pm after he drove her home to collect her things.

In pictures obtained by The Sun, Maura can be seen carrying her things towards Chris' front door as he lets her in.

The publication reports that the pair spent the evening ice skating and tenpin bowling at Queensway rink in Notting Hill.

They then went for dinner together before arriving back at Chris' place just before midnight.  

The sleepover will have fans speculating that Maura and Chris are more than just friends, which they have denied in the past.

Maura recently told The Sun's Fabulous magazine that she has not had sex for six months due to the coronavirus lockdown. 

She said: 'I 100 per cent feel the sexiest of my life. I'm getting sexy for my new man! Now I definitely feel like I'm ready to be with somebody.

'I'm 100 per cent single and ready to mingle. God help the next man I meet. I'm not sure he'll be able to put up with me!'

Chris previously addressed the rumours about him and Maura on Vicky Pattison's The Secret To podcast. 

Just pals? Their sleepover last month had fans speculating that Maura and Chris are more than just friends, which they have denied in the past 

The Geordie Shore star asked him if there was any truth to the fan theories that they were together but he bluntly replied: 'No, no, we're not.'  

But Vicky didn't back down, telling him that the pair would make the 'best couple'.

He replied: 'Yeah, potentially. We've never really thought about it like that, we're just super close mates.

'We care about each other, we look out for each other, we basically bully each other.'

He added: 'I don't think we ever say anything nice to each other's faces, but that's our banter. She's Irish and it's the Irish banter and that's my kind of banter.

'If you were around us together you'd think, 'these two f**king hate each other', we don't.

'We like each other and the thing is, it's never been something that's crossed our minds and it wouldn't happen for the fact that we don't want to ruin our friendship.

'We don't see each other that way. We're platonic, as they say, platonic friends.'  

Maura had previously been dating Curtis Pritchard, who she split from in March, while Chris was most recently in a relationship with Harley Brash.
