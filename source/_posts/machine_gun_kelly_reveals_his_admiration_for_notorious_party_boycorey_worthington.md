Machine Gun Kelly has revealed his favourite Australian star - notorious party boy Corey Worthington.   

Corey became a global sensation after throwing an out-of-control party at his parents' house in Melbourne in 2008, when he was just 16. 

A series of car-crash interviews, including one where he refused to remove his sunglasses on A Current Affair, made the teenager a household name.

The American rapper, 30, told Australia's The Sunday Project this weekend that he's a big fan - though he admits he didn't remember Corey's name. 

'Still the homie with the glasses on that was like, 16 years old and threw the party at his parents house that the neighbours hated,' he laughed when naming his favourite Aussie star.

Kelly added: 'You guys are so much more than that, however that is a great, great piece of content.

Loves it: The American rapper told The Sunday Project this weekend that he's a big fan. 'We don't know it yet but he low key is like, an Australian historical figure, dude!' he said

Corey is now barely recognisable from his days as an unlikely teenage icon without his trademark cap, bleached hair and large sunglasses.  

Now 29, he sports an even more dramatic hairstyle and elaborate neck tattoos.    

In 2018, he returned to reality television on the second season of Australian Ninja Warrior, debuting his muscular physique.

Corey told The Fix he has spent a decade trying to live up to his wild reputation after his out-of-control house party went viral.  

After publicising the event on Myspace, a reported 500 revelers turned up and the carnage that ensued attracted police helicopters and the dog squad to the property. 

Finding fame in 2008, Corey starred on Big Brother season eight later that year. 

'It's been a great ride,' he says proudly of his infamy. 'That's the role I've been chucked into and I owned it as much as I can.'
