She's suffered a tumultuous few months since announcing her split from former partner Steve 'Commando' Willis in January. 

But Michelle's heartbreak seemed like the last thing on her mind as she posed for a playful photo shoot with her hunky 12WBT co-trainer Todd Liubinskas on Friday. 

The pair were spotted galavanting down the beach at Double Bay together, with single mother Michelle, 49, playing up to the camera by jumping on Todd's back.  

Life's a beach! Michelle Bridges, 49, was all smiles as she froliced on the beach with hunky personal trainer Todd Liubinskas during a playful photo shoot at Double Bay on Friday

Grinning from ear-to-ear, Michelle seemed completely in her element as she bounded around the sand with her long-time pal.  

The fitness doyenne wore a maroon crop top and black leggings combo that revealed a glimpse at her rock-hard abs and bulging biceps. 

She tied her chestnut locks back into a ponytail and enhanced her remarkably smooth complexion with a dramatic makeup look.

Todd meanwhile was having a whale of a time as he laughed and joked with Michelle in front of the cameras.

Todd joined Michelle's hugely successful fitness brand 12WBT in July as the lead trainer behind her new 'Blokes Only' program.

'I feel like [women] have had their time in the sun, and rightly so and it needs to continue, but the health of the men in our lives is critically important,' Michelle told Body And Soul of her new male-oriented program.  

Todd confirmed he has a girlfriend last month, but the identity of his partner is still unknown.

Goofing off: Michelle poked fun at herself by bounding in the air and pulling a rather animated expression

Of her long-lasting friendship with Todd, Michelle told Body And Soul: 'I've known Todd for years - he was at the hospital the day after Axel [her four-year-old son with former partner, Steve Willis] was born.' 

'I admire Todd for working grassroots, holding people’s hands and talking them off the ledge, rather than it being all show for Instagram,' she added.  

The new business venture comes after a rocky year for Michelle, who was arrested for drink driving on Australia Day just weeks after confirming her separation from Commando.

Proud pal: Michelle told Body And Soul that she 'admires' Todd for 'working grassroots' rather than becoming another Instagram influencer to grow his fitness empire 

She was fined $750 and had her licence disqualified for three months, after pleading guilty to mid-range drink driving.

A tearful Michelle said outside court: 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep remorse, shame and humiliation [over] this incident and extreme lack of judgment.

'I would like to apologise to my family, friends and community for this gross error in judgment and the consequences of these actions will haunt me forever.'
