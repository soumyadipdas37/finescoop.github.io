This is the chilling moment a convicted paedophile killer confessed to the murder of the two underage daughters of a nurse he had met on a dating app.

The couple had been living together only one month when he raped both girls Elena and Nana Saprunova, eight and 13, and 'shredded' them with a knife, say Russian law enforcement.

Distraught divorcee Valentina Saprunova, 40, had no idea of his previous convictions for child rape and murder, say reports.

Footage shows suspect Vitaly Molchanov, 41, detained by heavily-armed special forces in Rybinsk over this week's double killings.

He is asked by a state investigator: 'What were you detained for?'

The detainee replied: 'For murder.'

Investigator: 'Do you admit your guilt?'

Molchanov: 'I admit. I am sorry, I do not understand why I did it.'

The girls' mother found her daughters when she came home after a 24-hour shift at the hospital where she got a job after moving her family 1,600 miles to move in with Molchanov who she met on a lonely hearts dating app.

The distraught mother is now admitted to the hospital where she worked.

'She sits and looks at one spot,' a source told 76.ru news outlet.

'She doesn't speak, just groans or hums.'

Her ex-husband, a former policeman, father of the dead girls, was due to arrive at Rybinsk.

Malchanov was found yesterday hiding in bushes outside the city where he had been sleeping rough.

After being handcuffed in the long grass, he told police: 'At about 8pm I opened another bottle, and finished it at about 10pm. And... so to say... killed them.'

Divorcee nurse Valentina Saprunova, 40, had been living with Molchanov for only a  month when she came home from her hospital job to find the bloodbath.   

Sisters Elena and Yana Saprunova, eight and 13, were 'shredded' by a knife and the younger girl's body was dismembered, say law enforcement in a case that has shocked Russians.

Both girls had been raped, according to forensic evidence. 

Molchanov was today being interrogated in the criminal investigation into the murder and rape of the two children. 

Earlier police had released a chilling video showing the suspect walking out of his home in a red and black track suit as he 'went on the run'. 

Saprunova has told police she had no idea of the seriousness of her lover's criminal record when they began a relationship.

Valentina had uprooted 1,600 miles across the country to move in with Molchanov one month ago after they met on a dating app.

But reports say she was unaware of his past as a child murderer and sex attacker for which he had been jailed for almost a decade.

He had told her he was wrongly convicted but not admitted the seriousness of the offences.

She is now in the care of a police psychologist too distraught even to talk to her family.

Neighbours said that the couple had appeared 'madly in love'.

They were often seen holding hands and jogging together or riding bicycles.

After walking out of his block of flats, he was reported to have made away on a white bike.

 Molchanov (pictured with the mother of his victims), 41, had prior convictions for child rape and murder and was released from a long prison sentence in 2010, according to reports

His previous 2010 conviction included murder, rape and desecration of the dead. He was also described as a 'convicted paedophile'.

The governor of Yaroslavl region, Dmitry Mironov had offered a £5,000 reward for information leading to Molchanov's detention.

Russia's children ombudsman Anna Kuznetsova called the killings 'inhuman'.

'No words to describe,' she said. 'A terrible crime. 

'It is known that he was previously convicted of the rape and murder of a child. 'Now two more girls have become victims.'

She demanded more action from the Kremlin to tackle paedophiles including a register and 'supervision' for child sex attackers.

She has previously pleaded for paedophiles to be tagged for life and banned from using the internet.

'Children are dying, let's take these or other measures to protect children,' she said.
