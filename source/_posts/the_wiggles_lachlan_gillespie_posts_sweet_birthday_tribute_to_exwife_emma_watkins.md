Yellow Wiggle Emma Watkins celebrated her 31st birthday on Tuesday. 

Leading the tributes was none other than her ex-husband, Purple Wiggle Lachlan 'Lachy' Gillespie. 

Posting to Instagram, the children's entertainer shared a sweet snap featuring his ex-wife on the set of a Wiggles TV special.

'Happy Birthday Emino,' he captioned the post.

The former flames have remained good friends following their 2018 split and Emma even congratulated Lachy on the recent birth of his daughters.   

Posting to Instagram earlier this month, Lachy announced that he and his ballet dancer fiancée Dana Stephensen had welcomed twin daughters. 

Emma, was quick to congratulate her colleague sharing two purple love heart emoji's in the comments.

Lachy shared a photo of his newborns - Lulu and Lottie - resting with their mother Dana, 34, as he looked on lovingly.

He wrote in the caption: 'Oh Lulu and Lottie, your mummy and daddy love you with all we have - you are both so beautiful - and I would love to sing to you both forever'.

Neither Lachlan nor Dana gave any hint that they were expecting ahead of the birth, and their social media accounts do not show many recent photos.
