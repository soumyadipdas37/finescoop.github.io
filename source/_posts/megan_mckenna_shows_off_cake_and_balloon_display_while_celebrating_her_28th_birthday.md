She burst onto the reality TV scene aged 22 with a stint on Ex On The Beach in 2015.

And as she turned 28 on Saturday, Megan admitted she 'couldn't do it' without her nearest and dearest in a sweet tribute post to commemorate her birthday, after spending most of her twenties in the spotlight.

The X Factor winner celebrated her birthday in style with her family and friends and didn't hold back on the extravagant decor, as her snaps showcased a decadent pastel coloured balloon wall and giant 28 numerals.

In the snaps singer Megan also proudly presented a huge rainbow birthday cake with her name iced onto the front in gold lettering.

The media personality opted for casual look as she sported a peach velour Juicy Couture tracksuit, which included a strapless top with the brand's name splashed across the front in dazzling silver diamantes.

Megan added a cosy edge to her look with a knitted cream cardigan and simply accessorised with a pair of silver earrings.

The former TOWIE star wore her brunette locks in a bouncy blown out style, while accentuating her pretty features with soft touches of dewy make-up.

Megan also shared a selection of snaps with her younger brother Harry and two of her gal pals. 

She captioned the images: '28 years around the sun and I couldn’t of done it without my family and besties. So lucky to have all of you! You know who you are.... to another year of making memories.'

Last month, it was reported that Megan is 'smitten' with her new businessman beau Josh Riley after he won her heart over during a series of fancy dinner dates. 

Josh didn't feature in any of the Instagram snaps on Megan's birthday.
