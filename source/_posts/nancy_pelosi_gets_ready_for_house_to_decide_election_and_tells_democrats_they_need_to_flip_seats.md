Nancy Pelosi sent an email to House Democrats Sunday imploring her colleagues to focus their efforts on flipping seats blue as she warns the lower chamber of Congress may be tapped to decide the results of the presidential election.

'The Constitution says that a candidate must receive a majority of the state delegations to win. We must achieve that majority of delegations or keep the Republicans from doing so,' the House Speaker urged in her letter, according to Politico.

'Because we cannot leave anything to chance, House Majority PAC is doing everything it can to win more delegations for Democrats,' she continued. 'It's sad we have to have to plan this way, but it's what we must do to ensure the election is not stolen.'

In the case that neither President Donald Trump nor Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins an Electoral College majority in November, the Constitution details that the election winner would be determined by which Party has the majority of House state delegations rather than which has a majority within the chamber overall.

Congress certifies the Electoral College results on January 6 – and should neither candidate earn the 270-vote majority required for an outright win, the newly elected House will become the determining factor.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is urging her Democratic colleagues to focus efforts on flipping seats blue in case the lower chamber of Congress is tapped to decide the results of the presidential election

Trump has expressed concern with Republicans in Congress over the possibility that the House may need to decide the election should neither he nor Joe Biden earn the 270 Electoral College votes needed for an outright win

Pelosi noted that Trump has suggested to Republicans in Congress that if they win a majority in November that they hold up certifying the election results.

Republican sources confirm that in private Trump has brought up concerns with GOP lawmakers over the possibility that the presidential race may need to be determined by the House. 

Pelosi, 80, urged her colleagues to donate their money, resources and time to the support the House Majority PAC to help ensure that certain states have a Democratic majority in their respective delegations.

'We have outstanding candidates in these key districts and they have built strong campaigns, but we must forcefully ensure they win,' the California Democrat wrote in her Sunday letter. 'Simply put, this strategy to protect our democracy and elect Joe Biden will take an all out effort and resources.'

'Many of you have already been patriotically generous supporting House Democrats and the Biden-Harris ticket. I'm asking you to help with this delegation strategy as well. Thank you for your generosity, your support, and your consideration.'

Pennsylvania, a swing state, is a prime example of how the House elections could affect the presidential election results this year.

The House delegation in the Keystone State is currently split evenly between the parties with nine Democrats and nine Republicans. Democrats, however, are expected to pick up seats after redistricting weakened GOP advantages in certain areas.

Any states with evenly split House delegations will not count in the case the House of Representatives is tapped to decide the results of the presidential election.

Another swing state, Michigan, is a wildcard even with a Democratic edge in the delegation split.

Rep. Justin Amash, a Republican turned independent turned Libertarian for Michigan's 3rd District – who supported Trump's impeachment – is retiring and will likely be replaced by a Republican ally of the president.

This would leave the state in a deadlock.

Some also claim Trump is rushing through his Supreme Court pick Amy Coney Barrett because he wants her seat secured before Election Day in such cases the election results were challenged and sent to court. 

'And I don't want to end up in the Supreme Court and I don't want to go back to Congress either, even though we have an advantage if we go back to Congress — does everyone understand that?' Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.

'I think it's 26 to 22 or something because it's counted one vote per state, so we actually have an advantage. Oh, they're going to be thrilled to hear that,' he continued.

Trump has already cast doubt over the 2020 election, claiming the only way he will lose is if Democrats cheat by way of fraud and ballot harvesting through mass mail-in voting measures implemented in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

The president insists he would want a ‘friendly’ transition of power should Biden win, but at the same time asserts there won’t be a transition, but a continuation since there is no way he loses if the election is conducted fairly.
