This photo of a packed Jetstar flight exposes the shocking reality for many Australians flying under supposedly 'COVID-safe' conditions.

The image, which was posted to Instagram on Thursday by former Married At First Sight bride Hayley Vernon, shows dozens of passengers crammed into the centre aisle of the plane - with no social distancing in sight.

Travellers appear to be seated beside each other and have almost no space between them, let alone the recommended 1.5 metres.

The reality of 'COVID-safe' flying: This photo of a crowded Jetstar flight, posted on social media on Thursday, shows how passengers aren't socially distancing despite airport rules 

Only a handful of passengers in the picture seem to be wearing face masks.

Ms Vernon, who lives in Melbourne, pointed out the discrepancy between the rules enforced at airports and how people actually behave on flights.  

She captioned the image: 'Jetstar - please use social distancing at airport. Also Jetstar - cramming flights for cash.'   

According to Qantas safety measures, social distancing is required throughout the airport, at the departure gates, when boarding, and again at the airport of arrival.

The airline, which owns Jetstar, 'strongly recommends' passengers wear face masks on all flights but notes that 'the risk of in-flight transmission remains extremely low'. 

Qantas and Jetstar also provide passengers with a Fly Well pack comprising a face mask and sanitising wipes for the flight, and recommend that travellers limit their movement around the cabin.

Explaining why the risk of transmitting coronavirus is low, the Qantas website states: 'The aircraft configuration, including the seats and galley, act as a natural barrier, and people are not seated face to face. The direction of in-flight airflow is ceiling to floor.'

It also notes that the plane's cabins are fitted with hospital-grade HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters and that the air inside is refreshed every few minutes.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Qantas and Ms Vernon for comment.

It comes amid fears of a third wave of in Victoria after the state recorded 800 COVID-19 deaths after two more people died overnight.

Another 15 cases were also reported, bringing Melbourne's 14-day average down to 15.6 infections, raising hopes the worst of its horror second wave is coming to an end.

But there have been 19 mystery cases in Melbourne recorded in the two weeks between September 15 and 28, meaning officials have no idea how people became infected.

Melbourne's 14-day average needs to drop below five and there must be fewer than five mystery cases in a fortnight before the state further eases restrictions.

Premier Daniel Andrews has said this isn't likely to happen until October 19.
