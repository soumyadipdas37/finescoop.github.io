Lily went onto share a snap with David outside the wedding chapel, before revealing they celebrated their marriage but grabbing fast food from In-N-Out. 

They were joined by Lily's children Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven, from her first marriage to Sam Cooper as they tucked into their fast food outside. 

According to TMZ, Lily and David registered to marry in Sin City at the end of last week, with a license valid for 12 months.

Public records obtained by the website state the expiration date for the license is September 6 2021 - meaning they were to wed within the year.

Lily's first wedding was very different - an idyllic ceremony in Gloucestershire in 2011 to Sam Cooper, whom she eventually split from in 2016.

The couple divide their time between the UK and the US and sparked engagement rumours in May, when Lily revealed a distinctive looking ring on social media.
