A creative shopper has used a $1.50 pineapple ice cube tray from Kmart Australia to make adorable and stylish drawer handles. 

Teleasha shared images of the result to a popular Facebook group dedicated to home décor hacks where she revealed how she made the handles.

'The $1.50 Kmart ice cube tray makes cute handles too - I just placed a chrome knob in the ice cube tray then poured resin around it, let it set and then spray painted it!' she said.

The creative home project is quite easy to do after purchasing the required materials - the ice cube tray, resin and $2.19 fingerpost knobs from Bunnings Warehouse.

Teleasha estimated the cost per handle to be around $3 each, which is very cheap compared to alternative store-bought handles.

Once the resin is left to dry, they remove easily from the silicone trays and can be spray painted. 

Teleasha painted the handles gold to match her blush pink decor and white walls, but the handles are rather small.
