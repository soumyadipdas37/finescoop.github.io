Beyoncé has escaped to the East Coast, where she's enjoyed some quality family time boating in the Hamptons.

And the 24-time Grammy winner has since returned to city life, as she was spotted in New York City.

She went incognito Thursday in a black hoodie and matching sweatpants, as she returned to their Manhattan home with daughter Blue Ivy, after spending the day together.

The 39-year-old wore her hood up with a blue surgical mask, while holding a tan fedora and a bag of beauty products.

Blue, eight, donned a denim jacket over a bright orange look, complemented with a black face mask.

Dad Jay-Z, 50, was later seen cutting a casual chic look in black, as he left his NYC office on Friday.

He sported a black collarless short-sleeve button-down shirt, buttoned once at the top, with slim matching slacks.

Jay-Z's mother-in-law Tina Knowles-Lawson, 66, recently revealed a surprising story behind her daughter's name, one that's since launched an empire. 

Tina told Heather Thomson on the podcast In My Head: 'A lot of people don't know that Beyoncé is my last name. It’s my maiden name.

Racist misspelling: She revealed that she and her brother were the only ones with the surname, as the hospital misspelled the family's name Beyincé on their birth certificates 

'My name was Celestine Beyoncé, which at that time was not a cool thing to have that weird name. I wanted my name to be Linda Smith because those were the cool names.'

She revealed that she and her brother were the only ones with the surname, as the hospital misspelled the family's name Beyincé on their birth certificates.

The House of Deréon co-founder detailed the subsequent conversation with her mom: 'So I said, "Well, why didn't you argue and make them correct it?"

'And she said, "I did one time. The first time, and I was told be happy that you're getting a birth certificate because, at one time, Black people didn't get birth certificates."'
