It has been almost five years since Braith Anasta split from Jodi Gordon.

And on Thursday, the former rugby league star, 38, spoke to Now To Love about juggling co-parenting with his 35-year-old ex-wife.

He explained that Jodi's recent return to Sydney, following her four-year stint on Melbourne-based soap Neighbours, means that she spends more time with their six-year-old daughter, Aleeia.

'I'm really big on routine and structure so that Aleeia has routine. She goes to school Monday to Friday and is here with us as a family and then Jodi has her on the weekends,' Braith said.

After quitting Neighbours, Jodi now gets to spend time with Aleeia more often during the week because she is based in the same city as her former spouse.

'[Aleeia] can see her whenever she likes. She probably sees her a bit more and can just go hang out - that's the advantage of being in Sydney,' Braith explained.

The footy commentator also revealed that he plans to marry his fiancée, Rachael Lee, at the end of 2021, after getting engaged last year. 

Although wedding planning has been postponed because of the pandemic, Braith said he and Rachael were not in a rush to tie the knot.

'We can't wait to get married, but we are pretty open to when that happens, so we're just going to take our time,' he said.
