An Oregon woman driving a car with 'f*** Trump' written across the window vandalized a Trump supporter's car at a Taco Bell drive-thru. 

The incident was shared to LiveLeak on Sunday and the user claimed it happened at a restaurant location in Sandy, which sits just 40 minutes away from the embattled city of Portland. 

Oregon, and specifically Portland, has become a battleground between anti-racism supporters and law enforcement for several weeks. 

The footage begins with an unidentified driver spraying silly string on a vehicle belonging to a President Trump supporter in the drive-thru line.

The driver then walks back to her green vehicle before getting inside the car and driving to the first drive-thru window. 

The other woman, sitting in a red vehicle behind the driver, is undeterred and holds a blow horn that blares loud sirens at the driver.

The woman follows the green car into the drive-thru, but stops when the driver parks her car and once again exits the vehicle.

This time, the driver appears to have a handful of food she throws at the woman as someone yells 'f*** you' in the background.

At least two Taco Bell employees watching the incident cheer on the driver.

When a person who recorded the incident approached the driver's vehicle, she looks at them and says, 'do you want a mask, bro?'

The driver then takes a medical face mask and raises it through the car's sun roof to give to the person.   

The exact date of the incident was not clear, but the original poster and others on social media said it occurred before a Sandy Back the Blue Flag Wave event.

Sandy Backs the Blue is a Facebook group with nearly 2,000 members that publicly supports law enforcement in the area.

Recently, group members have taken to the streets to hold a number of Flag Wave events along local roadways.

Footage shared online shows dozens of people waving Trump 2020 banners, American flags and the Thin Blue Line flag as cars whiz by. 

According to the page, the group holds Flag Wave events every Monday.

This summer, Oregon garnered national attention after more than 90 consecutive nights of protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  

Nationwide protests fighting against police brutality and racial inequality quickly erupted in all 50 states. 

On Sunday night, demonstrators continued to square off with law enforcement after Aaron Danielson, a member of the pro-Trump Patriot Prayer organization, was shot dead during protests in the city.

Police are thought to be investigating 48-year-old Michael Forest Reinoehl - who described himself on Instagram as '100% ANTIFA' - in relation to the shooting.

Reinoehl is a former member of the military who is now a professional snowboarder and has been a frequent attendee of protests in Portland, according to The Oregonian.

The convoy numbered around 600 vehicles, with Trump supporters flying flags as they cruised through Portland

He was previously accused of carrying a loaded gun to another demonstration, the paper reports.

Police said the caravan of around 600 had left the area around 8.30pm, and officers heard gunshots around 15 minutes later and arrived at the shooting scene 'within a minute'.

Danielson, also known as Jay Bishop, was shot in the chest and died at the scene. 

Joey Gibson, founder and leader of right wing group Patriot Prayer, said he was also in Portland on Saturday night when the shooting took place, and that he rushed to the scene immediately after.

'I can't say much right now. All I can do is verify that he was a good friend and a supporter of Patriot Prayer,' he earlier told the Associated Press.

Addressing his Facebook friends Gibson later added: 'If you planned on going to the boat cruise, please go! I know that Jay would love to look down from heaven and see tons of American flags on the Columbia river today. I will not be attending but I hope all of you enjoy yourselves out there. Fly them high for Jay. God Bless all of you.'

An Associated Press freelance photographer who heard three gunshots and then observed police medics attending to the victim said it was a white man wearing a hat with the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group whose members have frequently clashed with protesters in Portland in the past.

Donald Trump on Sunday paid tribute to the man shot and killed wearing a Patriot Prayer baseball cap during violent clashes between the president's supporters and BLM protesters in Portland Saturday night. 

Trump tweeted: 'Rest In Peace Jay!'

 He had retweeted Women for Trump co-founder Amy Kremer who wrote: 'This is Jay Bishop. He was a good American that loved his country and Backed the Blue. He was murdered in Portland by ANTIFA. Jay, we will never forget you. Rest In Peace my friend.'
