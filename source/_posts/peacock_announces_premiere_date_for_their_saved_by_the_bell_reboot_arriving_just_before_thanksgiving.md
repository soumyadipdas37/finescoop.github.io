NBC's Peacock streaming service used its namesake animal to reveal the premiere date for their highly-anticipated Saved By the Bell reboot.

While the streaming service had launched the first trailer in August, though they opted against sharing new footage to announce the November 25 premiere date.

The show will arrive on the Wednesday before the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend, though it is unclear if the show will release new episodes weekly or if all will be available to binge over Turkey Day.

The brief video opens in the familiar halls of Bayside High School, with a school bell ringing. 

However, no students come out of the classrooms, though a peacock does strut through the hallway.

When the peacock lets out a squawk, one of the lockers magically opens, likely mimicking the trick Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) used to open his locker while at Bayside High.

The peacock walks through the hallway as the last line of the original Saved By the Bell theme song plays, and the 11-25-20 premiere date is shown.

The project is one of the Peacock streaming service's highly-anticipated projects, bringing back several stars from the original show while following a whole new group of kids at Bayside High.

The show is set in present day, where Zack Morris has grown up to become the governor of California.

The official synopsis reveals that Morris 'gets into hot water for closing too many underfunded high schools.

In an attempt to fix this, he puts forth a new initiative where the affected students are sent to some of the state's most well-funded schools, including Bayside High.

The new students give, 'the privileged Bayside kids (who never have a problem that can't be solved in twenty-two minutes) a much-needed dose of reality.'
