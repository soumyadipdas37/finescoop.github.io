Sarah Jessica Parker was New York chic when she swung by her SJP shoe store in Manhattan this Tuesday.

The 55-year-old Sex And The City star cut a typically glamorous figure in a dark tartan skirt that went below the knee.

She buttoned herself into a stylish snakeskin print blouse that she only half tucked in, emphasizing her trim waistline.

Sarah Jessica made sure to take the precaution of wearing a face mask as she emerged from lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Sweeping her hair into a long braid, she slung a fanny pack cross-body from one shoulder and slipped into black heels.

The Ed Wood actress showed her pride in the city she calls home by carrying an 'I [heart] NY' canvas bag on her latest outing.

During her latest visit to her store she could be seen helping a customer with her purchase as she has frequently been seen doing of late.

Earlier this month she was part of a group of 177 business leaders in New York sent their Mayor Bill De Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo a letter urging a government plan to help businesses get through the pandemic.

Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette, Goldman Sachs chairman David Solomon and Lyft co-founder Josh Zimmer also signed the letter, which warned that a third of the city's small businesses could close permanently without such a plan.

She and her longtime husband Matthew Broderick are reportedly seeking $19 million for the West Village townhouse they bought 20 years ago for $2.99 million, according to a New York Post article from January.

They are planning to eventually vacate the 115-year-old townhouse as they put together their dream home - a combination of two adjacent townhouses they scooped up for $35 million four years ago.
