He's already has an impressive property portfolio which boasts a stunning $24m (£19m) beachfront mansion in Malibu and a $23m (£18m) Los Angeles home.

And Simon Cowell is now thought to have bought and then quickly flipped a $3.9m (£3m) home in LA's Hidden Hills area which previously belonged to his former 2006 X Factor mentee Leona Lewis. 

It is understood that a corporate entity linked to the music mogul, 60, agreed to an off-market deal to purchase the singer's abode but ended up quickly selling it on at a loss for $3.7m (£2.8m), reports Variety. 

Real estate deal: Simon Cowell has reportedly purchased Leona Lewis' former home in the Hidden Hills area of LA and sold it on for a $200,000 loss (pictured the back garden area of the $3.9m house)

According to property records, the Bleeding Love singer sold the 5,900 square foot estate not even a year after she first purchased it for $3.6m. 

MailOnline has contacted Simon Cowell and Leona Lewis' representatives for a comment. 

Listings indicate there are five bedrooms as well as seven full and two half bathrooms between the approximately 4,900 square-foot single-story main house and a detached guesthouse. 

Inside the main sprawling ranch-style home, which is partly clad in the same red brick that covers the driveway, there's lots of rooms with plenty of space for storage and furniture. 

Careers: The entertainment mogul was the singer's mentor during the X Factor back in 2006. Leona (pictured right in March) went on to win the series and have hits including Bleeding Love and Better In Time

Spacious: The huge home comes with its own impressive pool and outdoors cooking area which makes it perfect for entertaining guests

The carpeted living room is airy with a large fireplace as its focal point. Sunlight floods through the huge windows and numerous skylights in the vaulted ceiling, filling the space with light. 

Meanwhile, polished flooring leads into the kitchen, which mixes wood cabinets with decorative pops of sky-blue paint. There are also practical grey countertops and stylish blue hanging lights filling the space.

Another of the main house's rooms has been converted to an oak-paneled room with a breakfast bar area and built-in TV perfect for entertaining guests.

While the light-filled master suite offers a fireplace, a private garden, a Zen-inspired bathroom and a huge, lavishly fitted walk-in closet.

Private: The one-story home, which boasts five bedrooms, is accessed down a long red brick driveway and surrounded by green trees and bushes

Colourful: A utility room at the mansion boasts two washing machines and mismatched cupboards, some with blue and some with the simple wood fronts

At the rear of the house, the floor tiles in the kitchen extend out to a huge outdoor patio space with a built-in grill. Beyond this, there's a swimming pool and a tree-shaded fire pit with built-in bench. 

A separate, 1,000 square-foot deluxe guest house offers a poolside lounge with kitchenette, a pool bath with exterior entry and a deluxe bedroom and second bathroom.

While among the list of well-known neighbours in the area is John Stamos, Drake and Jessica Simpson, reports Variety.

It comes after Simon, who is recovering from breaking his back following a freak accident on a new electric bike in Malibu, was reported to be selling his £18m Los Angeles home.

So much storage! Another stunning feature is a walk-in-wardrobe which has several shelves and draws. The room features spotlights in the ceiling and wooden floors

Open plan: The main kitchen also has blue cupboards, similar to the utility area. As well as having plenty of storage room the space opens out into a generously sized back garden

A source told the publication: ‘The LA house was his dream for a while but it holds one too many showbiz memories.

‘Now he has son Eric and long-term partner Lauren he wants to lead a simpler life and create new memories not revolving around rock ’n’ roll, TV or parties’.

He paid £19.5million for the house in 2017 which has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms spread over 10,000 square feet.
