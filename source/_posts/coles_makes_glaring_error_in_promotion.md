Coles appears to have made a glaring maths error in a discount deal that charges customers more if they buy more than one product.

The supermarket put a special onÂ 118g packs of Ritz sandwich crackers salted caramel, and the chocolate flavoured variant.

Usually costing $1.50, they were advertised as 75c each - but also 'any two for $2', which would be more expensive than buying two packs individually.

This mistake was carried forward for larger buys with each pack effectively costing $1 instead of 75c.

Unsuspecting shoppers could easily see the special and stock up, and may not notice they were actually paying for more than they should be.

Screenshots of the mistake circulated on social media and appears not to have been fixed on the Coles website.

Whether the problem would be caught be checkout operators in store is not clear.

'Registers didn't really let you mark prices up only down, so depending on how the automated systems work you may get charged the original price of $1.50 instead of the 'sale' price,' one person speculated.
