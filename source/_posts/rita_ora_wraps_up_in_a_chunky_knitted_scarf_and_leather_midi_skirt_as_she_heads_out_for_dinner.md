Rita's outing comes after the secret to maintaining her svelte physique was revealed.    

The Girls singer often treats herself to a £450 anti-cellulite procedure, with celeb skincare expert Shane Cooper, which sees electromagnetic waves aimed at her pins through a laser machine, reports The Sun.

Shane, who also treats TV presenters Maya Jama and Laura Whitmore, said: 'It's the only treatment that addresses both muscle and fat with such an intense workout.'

Rita has appeared on Shane's social media pages several times, with her saying her 'skins never felt so radiant and hydrated' after one visit to the clinic.

It comes as it was revealed that ITV bosses were keen to get Rita's older sister Elena, 31, to appear on the next season of Love Island, reports The Mirror. 

MailOnline has contacted ITV for a comment.

However they might be out of luck as Elena already runs a busy schedule as Rita's manager.

She was only 19 and still studying at university when she started representing Rita and the sisters have gone on to achieve impressive success. 

Speaking about working with her sister, Elena explained how it's more than a normal job and she wants to 'leave a legacy' with Rita.
