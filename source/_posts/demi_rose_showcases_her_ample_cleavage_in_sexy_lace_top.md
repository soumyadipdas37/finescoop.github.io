 She is currently living it up in Ibiza after a lonely lockdown in London. 

And Demi Rose was making the most of her time in the sunshine as she posed for her latest series of sexy snaps in a barely-there ensemble on Tuesday. 

The model, 25, looked phenomenal in a plunging lace number which showed off her eye-popping cleavage before she later changed into a skin-tight dress.

Demi was putting on a showstopping display as she donned the stunning lace number which struggled to contain her eye-popping cleavage.   

She later donned a sexy dress with a zip fastening which again made the most of her ample curves while pulling her very best pose.  

Demi's latest slew of snaps comes shortly after she admitted her world 'could have spiralled out of control' following the deaths of her parents, as she opens up about her grief in a brave interview about her experiences with grief. 

 She suffered the loss of her father Barrie Mawby at the end of 2018, with tragedy striking again soon after when her mother Christine passed away in June 2019.

And amid her heartache, the star also discussed her mental health, telling how it almost 'got the better' of her during lockdown, in a candid chat to mark World Suicide Prevention Day next week.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Demi shared how she's coping with her personal tragedy and reveals how her heartbreaking loss has in a way made her 'stronger'. 

The star revealed how she was forced to 'grow up' from a young age after her mother was left disabled following a heart attack, resulting in a then 17-year-old becoming her carer.

She recalled that after losing her loved ones in quick succession left her 'angry, sad, bitter and lonely', but added that she was 'lucky' that she had a 'good support system' around her and didn't 'bottle up' her grief.  

Admitting that she could have easily succumbed to her anger and grief, Demi said: 'When my parents died my world could have spiralled out of control but you have to hang on.'

She went on to say that she was helped greatly by doing a lot of self-care and reading books about 'spirituality' and 'enlightenment', while she tried to look at her tragedy as part of 'life’s plan'.

Demi added that though she's been through trauma, she's come out 'stronger' and tries to reflect her strength through her positive and 'confident' social media posts.
