Much has been said on Liverpool's lack of fresh faces during the summer transfer window ahead of their first ever attempt to defend their Premier League title. 

So far, left-back Kostas Tsimikas has been the only signing made by Jurgen Klopp as they continue to draw out their transfer saga with Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara. 

The Reds have also received boosts with the return of loanee striker Rhian Brewster and the emergence of academy graduate Curtis Jones - but neither will make a massive impact on the first-team this season.

After winning the Premier League, Jurgen Klopp has signed only one player for Liverpool

After winning the league with 99 points - 18 points ahead of second-placed Man City - many would argue 'if it isn't broke, don't fix it', but their 4-3 victory in their season opener against Leeds has left some questioning whether they need to freshen up their squad before the window closes.

Here, Sportsmail look at the areas that Liverpool could strengthen before the transfer window closes and suggest a potential signing for each position. 

Striker

Liverpool's No 9 Roberto Firmino has been a pivotal player in the club's recent success over the last few seasons, featuring in both their Champions League and Premier League triumphs. 

However, while he operates very well in the deep-lying role up front with Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, his goal and assist return has taken a hit over the past year.  

He seems to have lost some confidence in front of goal, but this sometimes goes under the radar due to the rampant finishing of his team-mates around him. He does play well, but for a No 9 he does not score enough goals.

Earlier in the window, Klopp appeared to be closing in on the perfect target in RB Leipzig's Timo Werner - a proven goalscorer in Europe's top competitions. Fast forward and the Reds failed to sign the German, who is now at Chelsea. 

PSG's Kylian Mbappe would be the perfect fit, however, he would be way out of the club's budget and almost impossible to sign. 

Barcelona's Antione Griezmann is another idealistic, yet unrealistic, addition as he operates well in a deeper-lying forward role. 

Attacking midfielder 

Liverpool's midfield options are rather strong. Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum, Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner are among the most natural to fit in Klopp's preferred three.

However, their options offer plenty of defensive stability but lack a little pizzazz in an attacking sense. While Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wijnaldum are capable of surging forward, scoring and assisting, an out-and-out No 10 would fit in well in the team's 4-3-3 system and would give Klopp another option either off the bench or against different oppositions.

Their main transfer target for the past month, Thiago Alcantara would be capable of filling those shoes and is versatile as he can sit deeper if needed.

Goalkeeper

Not for one second is anyone suggesting that first-choice Allison Becker should be replaced. He has earned the No 1 shirt at Anfield and will likely remain in that spot for many seasons.

However, a second-choice goalkeeper would be a very welcome addition to the Liverpool squad - with Adrian and Loris Karius currently the other two stoppers at the Reds' disposal.

Last season, in Allison's absence, Adrian filled the Brazilian's boots well to an extent, but had many shaky moments between the sticks with Liverpool fans never quite certain and assured that he would get through a game mistake-free. 

The Premier League champions appear to be closing in on filling this position, as they have agreed a deal for 17-year-old Fluminense goalkeeper Marcelo Pitaluga.

Winger

Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah are two of the most dangerous attacking wide players in the world. Liverpool owe a lot of their success to the duo, who have been their two most consistent goal scorers and assist kings.

If either of those two get injured, next in line is Xherdan Shaqiri. The Swiss international is a good player, but is simply nowhere near the level of his two superiors and Liverpool would most definitely notice the difference if he was to replace their first-choice wide-men for a number of games. 

Divock Origi has also stepped in at times out wide, and it has had the same, less potent effect. 

Wolves winger Adama Traore would be a great addition for the Reds, as he would add fierce competition for both Mane and Salah and possesses the same lightning quick pace that the Reds love to utilise in wide areas.
