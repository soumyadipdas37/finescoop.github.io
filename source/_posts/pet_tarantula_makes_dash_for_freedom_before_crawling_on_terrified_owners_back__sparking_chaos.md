A pet tarantula caused a family in West Sussex to go into meltdown after it broke free from its tank.

Video footage taken by a family in Beeches Crescent, West Sussex, shows a man slowly trying to remove a pet tarantula from its tank.

Using a pencil, the man slowly nudges the arachnid onto his left arm.

A man from Beeches Crescent, West Sussex, gently nudges his son's pet tarantula onto his hand with a pencil before is runs off up his arm

Screams are heard from people watching as the spider crawls over the man's back and shoulders. he lies down on the ground as people scream

Sensing an opportunity for freedom though, the spider then attempts to dart away before crawling up the man's arm and onto his shoulders.

He is heard saying: 'You're going to have to help me out, someone.'

The tarantula then scuttles onto the man's neck while people in the background scream and laugh at the man's unfortunate situation.

A wooden skull is then used to try and encourage the spider off of the man's back but as soon as it enters the skull it then climbs through a hole and onto the man again - with all those standing around watching then screaming again.

As the man lies on the floor, a helper uses a wooden skull to try and pick the spider up. Unfortunately it falls through a hole and lands on the man again who asks for help from those stood watching

The video ends with the spider making its way down the man's back while he lies on the floor, still asking for help.

The person who filmed the video said: 'So we purchased a new tarantula for my six-year-old son. In the shop the spider was nice and calm, handled nicely.

'After settling down at home for a few days, my son asked me to get it out so we could show it to our friends, that's when it went wrong. 

'It went straight up my husband's arm, onto his back and no one helped him, I just don't know what I would if done if it went down my jumper instead!!'

The video was originally filmed on April 2 but was recently shared online.
