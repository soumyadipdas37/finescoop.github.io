Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello's gated community was infiltrated by a stranger claiming to know her son Manolo, TMZ report. 

The Modern Family star, 48, and the Magic Mike actor, 45, reportedly fell victim when the suspect broke into their gated community but was infiltrated by security.

When security in the exclusive area suspected the trespasser, he reportedly claimed he knew Sofia's son, 28, leading to suspicions and an eventual police call.

Law insiders told the site that Sofia and Joe were faced with the drama when the man made his way into the community at noon last week. 

When he was approached by security, who were suspicious of his behaviour, he is said to have told his story about Monolo.  

Security called for support from the police and after he refuses to leave quietly, he was arrested and charged with trespassing. 

MailOnline has contacted Joe and Sofia's representatives for comment.
