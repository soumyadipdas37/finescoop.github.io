Harry Redknapp believes Gareth Bale could lead Tottenham back into the Champions League places if the club complete a sensational transfer this summer.

The Real Madrid star has been linked with a move back to his former side and Redknapp, who had four years with Welshman in north London, thinks it would be a great deal for both parties.

Bale left Spurs for the LaLiga club in a record £86million deal in 2013, a year after Redknapp also departed White Hart Lane.

The Real Madrid star has been linked with a move back to his former side after leaving in 2013

The 31-year-old has gone on to win 13 trophies in seven years but has fallen out of favour with current Real boss Zinedine Zidane and is seeking a way out. His agent Jonathan Barnett told BBC Wales that 'Gareth still loves Spurs... It's where he wants to be.'

And Redknapp thinks the winger would light up the Premier League once again and could take Tottenham back into contention for the top four.

'He'd be great for Tottenham and great for the Premier League,' Redknapp told Sky Sports News.

'It would be a great move for Gareth Bale as he needs to be playing. It's a waste of a great talent to see him not involved at a team like Real Madrid so he could really make the difference for Tottenham, that's for sure. He's such a special talent.

'I think Tottenham will pay a percentage of his wages. Let's say he's on £500,000-a-week, Tottenham will pay around a third of that knowing Daniel Levy. He'll certainly do a good deal for Tottenham.

'He's a great athlete and he's a complete all-rounder: he can run, head and shoot. Hopefully, he'll come and they'll take their time with him and bed him in slowly. He'd be such a boost for Tottenham. 

'With a forward line of Son, Kane, Bale and Dele Alli that's a scary attacking line-up and they'd do some damage.

Bale became a fan favourite at Spurs where he scored 56 goals and provided 58 assists

'At present, I don't see them finishing in the top four, but signing Gareth would give them a much better chance of doing that. Bale would tip the balance in their favour as he's such a good player.' 

The Wales captain became a fan favourite at Spurs where he scored 56 goals and provided 58 assists in 203 appearances.

Sportsmail understands Real Madrid will pay more than half of Bale's £500,000-per-week wages to facilitate the deal to Tottenham. 

Chairman Daniel Levy was at the forefront of negotiations over a potential deal on Tuesday

Chairman Daniel Levy, who is also trying to close a deal for Real's highly-rated left-back Sergio Reguilon, was at the forefront of Tottenham's negotiations on Tuesday.

Sources claimed that Spurs are even prepared to use Dele Alli as a makeweight in the deal for Bale, such was their determination to clinch a return for the 31-year-old.

Manchester United have also been linked with the winger with AS reporting that the Red Devils are still in with a chance, despite losing ground on Spurs in the race for his signature.
