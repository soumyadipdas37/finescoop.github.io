He's one of the most in-demand models in the world.

And on Friday, Jordan Barrett showed off his genetically blessed looks while out at lunch with a female friend in London's trendy Notting Hill. 

The 23-year-old, who dressed casually for the outing, drew attention to his shaggy locks and striking facial features.

Jordan opted for an all-black ensemble, consisting of a black hooded jacket, casual trousers, socks and Birkenstock slides.  

His signature shaggy locks framed his face, and he added touches of bling in the form of a bracelet and statement rings on his fingers.

Jordan enjoyed a bite to eat at a trendy Pan-Asian restaurant in the area, and caught up with a brunette pal, who looked to have brought her child along.

The chance meeting took place when he was caught stealing matches from a convenience store in Byron Bay, Australia.

Jordan previously told New York Magazine of the incident: 'I wanted to have a cigarette, but I couldn't get a lighter because apparently you have to be over 18, so I decided I was gonna take matches from the counter.'
