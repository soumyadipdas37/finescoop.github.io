A five-year-old girl has issued a stern warning to the thief who stole $600 she had been saving towards a Ferrari.

Maddison Houston, five, had raised the money by doing chores and selling strawberries at her mother's cafe, Whistlestop at Pimpama, on the Gold Coast. 

But it was all stolen on Sunday night when the crook cut the power to the cafe and broke in.

He took all of Maddison's hard earned cash as well as the business' weekly takings.

The five-year-old said she would have done the thief a favour if they hadn't taken all her money. 

'I would take you in the Ferrari if you didn't steal my money,' she told 7News.

'Give me back my money, because it's not your money. I made it for my business.'

Only the man's silhouette was caught on CCTV before he cut the power to the entire store and broke his way in.

Maddison described the thief as a 'grown up' who kicked the door and left a shoe print before 'grabbing stuff without asking'.

The family business has been robbed six times since it has been owned by Maddison's mother, Sarah Degen.

'What sucks is that I put in a lot of time and I sacrifice a lot of my time with my family and my children,' she said.

Ms Degen took to Facebook once she realised an entire week worth of work was stolen from her.

'We got broken into last night!' the devastated mother wrote. 

'We are absolutely gutted after such a hard week now everything is gone!

'To you low lives we work seven days a week, 20 plus hour days so our kids can have a better future...you stole from our children...hope it’s worth it!' 

Queensland Police are investigating the break-in.
