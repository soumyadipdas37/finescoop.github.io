Game Of Thrones actor Hafthor Júlíus Björnsson and his wife Kelsey Henson revealed on Sunday that they had welcomed their first child together.

The strongman-turned-actor and his wife announced that she had given birth to a baby boy on Saturday, though they weren't ready to share their child's name.

Both Hafthor and Kelsey shared some adorable photos of the newly arrived baby to their Instagram accounts to celebrate the joyous occasion.

Kelsey shared a sweet photo of herself and her husband cuddled up with their adorable baby between them.

Hafthor, who's best known for playing The Mountain on HBO's Game Of Thrones, looked massive as he held his son's tiny hand in his own mitt.

Kelsey looked relaxed and relieved and wore a beige shirt covered in dinosaurs while sporting metal-frame cat-eye glasses.

'Our beautiful baby boy made his grand entrance into the world at 11:19 AM on September 26th 2020 after a short and intense six hours,' she wrote in the caption. '3530 grams [7.78lbs] and 52 cm [20.5in]. The birth was the most powerful, life changing, empowering thing I’ve ever done in my entire life. We are all doing well and settling in at home as three!'

Early morning: Hafthor wrote that he was awakened at 6 a.m. to Kelsey telling him her water had broken, though they chose to wait at their home in Iceland for a midwife to arrive

Kelsey kept her update fairly concise, but her husband went into greater detail about the day leading up to the birth.

He wrote that he was awakened at 6 a.m. to Kelsey telling him her water had broken, though they chose to wait at their home in Iceland for a midwife and doula to arrive.

Though they initially hoped to do a home birth, the pregnancy progressed too quickly, so everyone left for a birthing center about 10 minutes away.

At 11:19, following '2 hours and 19 mins of pushing,' Kelsey gave birth to the little boy.

Hafthhor said the new trio arrived home in the evening, with 'both mom and baby doing super well,' and they all 'spent our first night as three together.'

'We have decided on a name and cannot wait to share it with you all soon,' he added at the end.

Child #2: In addition to his baby son, Hafthor already has a daughter, Theresa Líf, whom he shares with his ex-girlfriend Thelma Björk Steimann

Falling in love: The fitness star met Kelsey when she worked as a bartender in Alberta, Canada, in late 2017. They married in October 2018 and announced the pregnancy in April of this year

In addition to his baby son, Hafthor already has a daughter, Theresa Líf, whom he shares with his ex-girlfriend Thelma Björk Steimann.

The fitness star began dating Kelsey in late 2017, when she was working as a waitress in Alberta, Canada, her home country.

The two hit it off after Hafthor visited her bar while competing in a strongman competition in the area. 

They married in October 2018, and announced her pregnancy in April of this year. 

They make quite a contrast when standing next to each other, as the athlete towers at 6ft9in, whereas Kelsey is only 5ft2in.

He also has weighed in at around 450lbs at various points, and he set a new deadlifting record in May of this year after he deadlifted a stunning 1,105lbs. 

Iconic: On Game Of Thrones, he played the massive Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane, brother of Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane, from seasons four through eight; shown together in April 2019

On Game Of Thrones, he played Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane, brother of Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane.

The character was played by two different actors in the first two seasons of the series, but Hafthor took over the role in season four and continued until the final season, making him the one most identified with the part.

Despite originally working as a waitress, Kelsey seems to have taken up her husband's passion for fitness, and she regularly shows off her own muscles on Instagram, even after announcing her pregnancy.

A week ago, Hafthor announced on his Instagram that he was quarantining after possibly being exposed to someone who contracted the novel coronavirus, but he appeared to have gotten a negative test result and was able to be with his wife in time for the birth.
