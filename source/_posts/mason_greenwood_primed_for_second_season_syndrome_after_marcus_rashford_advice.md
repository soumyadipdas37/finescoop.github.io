Mason Greenwood insists he is fully prepared for the 'second season syndrome' as he prepares for his England debut following a blistering breakthrough campaign.

The Manchester United rookie notched 18 goals in all competitions last term, earning him a call-up to Gareth Southgate's latest squad.

But the 18-year-old is well aware that his career will not always be plain sailing.

Greenwood has been called up to England's latest squad after a breakthrough season last term

Many young players, particularly, forwards have struggled to replicate their performances during their second seasons as fully-fledged first-team members.

But Greenwood is adamant - thanks to some guidance from team-mate Marcus Rashford - that he is fully prepared for what's ahead.

He said: 'Obviously I am aware of that (tough second season), but he [Rashford] has just said always go out with a smile on your face and don't really think about anything.

'Go out with a smile on your face because you are playing for Manchester United - not many people get to do that. So just go out and work hard and show what you can do. I am looking forward to next season.

'It's pretty easy to deal with the hype. The players at United get taught to ignore it to just carry on doing what you're doing because everyone will be supporting you when you're doing good but maybe when you're doing bad, not many people will be supporting you.

'So it's all about staying calm and just forgetting about it because it's what's on the pitch that's more important.'
