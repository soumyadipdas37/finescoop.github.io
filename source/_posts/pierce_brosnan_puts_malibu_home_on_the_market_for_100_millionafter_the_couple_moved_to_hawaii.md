James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan is selling his Malibu beachfront mansion after putting the home on the market for $100 million. 

It will see the 007 star making quite the profit after Brosnan created the estate by combining two separate plots of land that he purchased for $5.1 million and $2.25 million. 

The oceanfront retreat spans more than an acre with two homes that combine for five bedrooms and 14 bathrooms.  

The house was built in 2010 and has so many solar panels that the new owner will be able to heat the house, outdoor pool and guest cabana and still sell electricity back to the local grid.

The home is exceptionally eco-friendly with all water being recycled on site in a purpose-built plant along with a waste disposal system, custom-built energy-saving lighting and a solar-powered revolving compost heap.  

An extraordinary amount of care and craftsmanship went in to designing and building the mansion and matching pool house

There are seven fire places on the property including several outdoor fire pits on the patio

A saltwater pool makes for a refreshing and relaxing way to spend the day at the stunning home 

There's plenty of space for lounging around and relaxing while enjoying the beach and ocean nearby  

Sandy lounges and a glass-enclosed dining areas sit in the backyard

The home's Southeast-Asian inspiration comes from Brosnan's time shooting the 1997 Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. It took about 10 years to build

All the doors slide back to that easy access to the patio can be enjoyed together with refreshing sea breezes 

The Asian-look of the home apparently came after Brosnan was inspired while filming Tomorrow Never Dies in Thailand

Irish-born Brosnan, 67, along with his wife Keely Shaye Smith, 56, have since moved to Hawaii.    

When their dream home was first built, the pair were determined that it would set a new standard in being eco-friendly. 

In the listing featured on realtor Christopher Cortazzo's website, he describes the 'once in a lifetime' property in detail. 

'This retreat is surrounded by wrap-around lanais and courtyards that invite yoga at dawn, relaxing afternoons, sunset cocktails and effortless entertaining beneath the stars,' the description reads. 'On a rare parcel of more than one acre with approximately 117 feet of beachfront, Orchid House is created for resort-style living.'   

The master suite alone spans 4,000 square feet, and comes with two fireplaces, an art studio and a deck that looks out to the ocean.

The lower level of the home includes a screening room with seats for 20, two bars and climate-controlled wine storage with space for about 200 bottles. Elsewhere, there’s a music room, a gym and a spa with two soaking tubs. 

All the windows are non-glare, insulated glass and there is a centrally controlled climate and lighting system that will automatically turn off the lights if a room is left vacant for more than five minutes.

The climate control also automatically adjusts various rooms to maximize energy savings. 

Brosnan was actively involved in every single aspect of building the home, right down to choosing the natural recycled wood for the kitchen benches and the low-flow toilets.' 

A vast stone terrace spans the width the property with has a number of sitting and dining areas together with fire pits 

A shot of the courtyard a night makes the home appear more like a resort hotel than a family mansion

The bedroom on the upper level of the home open out on to a balcony which provide sumptuous views of the ocean and pool

There's no shortage of chairs at the home, while a glass paneled dining area helps to calm the winds whilst eating

The double-island gourmet kitchen has floor-to-ceiling glass sliders that allow easy access on to the outdoor patio

The master bedroom on the second level enjoys stunning views over the beach and a wrap around terrace

Along with the eco-technology, the house is packed with gadgets to make Bond proud.

There is a state-of-the-art security system with pressure sensors and infra-red lights, directly linked to the local sheriff.

The new homeowners will get to enjoy sweeping views of the Pacific from the massive master suite, his-and-her bathrooms, a private spa and sauna, gym, solarium, library and high definition screening room.

Brosnan starred in four James Bond films from 1995 to 2002: 'GoldenEye,' 'Tomorrow Never Dies,' 'The World Is Not Enough' and 'Die Another Day.' 

Neighbors on Malibu's Broad Beach also include Cher, Mel Gibson, Steven Spielberg and Goldie Hawn.

The Great Room allows for plenty of natural light to fill the space. Huge couches allow for a several guests to join the fun

The courtyard of the home is beautifully landscaped with palm trees either side 

Stunning views of Malibu beach can be had as waves from the Pacific Ocean crash ashore

A two-level guest house on the property also serves as a pool house with a bar

Te grounds feature sprawling natural elements such as tropical flowers, palm trees,  courtyards and wraparound porches

The views of the crashing ocean waves and mountain ranges prove to be magnificent

The main house forms a U-shaped around a palm-lined courtyard entrance. The green roof matches the mountains behind it

The oceanfront property, which took roughly 10 years to complete at the behest of wife, Keely, sits on more than an acre and features two homes that combine for five bedrooms and 14 bathrooms
