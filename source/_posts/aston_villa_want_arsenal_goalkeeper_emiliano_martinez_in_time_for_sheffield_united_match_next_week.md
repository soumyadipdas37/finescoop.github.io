Aston Villa are pushing to sign Emiliano Martinez from Arsenal in time for their opening league fixture against Sheffield United next week.

Martinez has been identified as Villa’s No1 goalkeeping target as Tom Heaton will not have recovered from his knee injury in time for the start of the campaign, while Pepe Reina – on loan from AC Milan for the second half of last season – returned to Italy and joined Lazio. 

Villa’s most recent offer is believed to be around the £15million mark.

The 28-year-old has been seeking to understand how regularly he is likely to play under Mikel Arteta, with Bernd Leno now fit again. 

Martinez shone last season when deputising for the injured Leno but the German is expected to be first choice once more this season, even though Martinez was given the nod when Arsenal beat Liverpool on penalties in the Community Shield last month.

Current Villa keepers Orjan Nyland and Lovre Kalinic are believed to be surplus to requirements, while Jed Steer has not played since damaging his Achilles tendon at Wolves last November.

Yet Steer is highly regarded by Smith after playing a key role in the club’s promotion from the Championship in 2019, and if no keeper has been signed before the Sheffield United game, he may be handed a starting spot.

Martinez has been with Arsenal since 2011 but was never given the chance to play regularly until last season. 

During his time with the Gunners he has had loan spells with Oxford, Sheffield Wednesday, Rotherham, Wolves, Getafe and Reading.
