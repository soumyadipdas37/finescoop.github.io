Reese Witherspoon is celebrating her daughter Ava Phillippe's milestone 21st birthday.

The actress, 44, marked the special occasion with several sweet snaps of her mini-me on Wednesday, including one of Ava as a baby.

Reese also shared a snap of herself with her daughter, whose looks are frequently compared to hers. 

Ava looked just like a young Reese as she struck a pose with her mother.  

In the glowing caption, Reese raved about her daughter's many positive qualities.

'Wow! How is it possible that this little girl is now 21 years old?' Reese captioned the snap. 'Happy Birthday to my sweet girl who has become the most incredible young woman.

'Her kindness, her compassion, and her huge heart never cease to amaze me. Ava, there aren't enough words to describe how proud I am of everything you've already accomplished. I cannot wait to see ALL the Good you will put into this world. I love you so much @avaphillippe' 

Ava and her younger brother Deacon, 16, are the children of Reese and her ex-husband Ryan Phillippe.

The Legally Blonde actress remarried in 2011 to talent agent Jim Toth, whom she now shares seven-year-old son Tennessee with.

Girls only! Reese and Ava enjoyed a hearty salad together 

Ava now studies at the University of California, Berkeley, but for Reese, watching her eldest child leave the nest was far from easy. 

'It's weird when your children go away to college,' Reese previously told host Ellen DeGeneres during a segment on her talk show. 

'It's hard. I never imagined how it felt for my mom. I might have gone into [Ava's] empty room, laid down on her bed and cried when she went to college.'

While Ava hits the books, Reese's son Deacon is currently pursuing a career in music.

Deacon recently released his new single Long Run, and Reese shared a video of herself dancing along to the song as her mortified son watched on.

But Reese feels it's her duty to embarrass her children.  

'I just say if you're not embarrassing your children, you're not spending enough time with them,' she recently told guest host Kerry Washington on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

'That's basically my role. It's our job, as parents, to really ramp up the embarrassment.'
