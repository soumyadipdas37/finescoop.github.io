She stunned in Monaco recently as she showed off her slimmed-down figure alongside her new boyfriend, Jacob Busch.

And on Tuesday, Rebel Wilson shared a photo to Instagram of herself flaunting her 18kg weight loss in a swimsuit while enjoying some fun in the sun.

The 40-year-old actress slipped into a halterneck swimsuit, which she teamed with a black embroidered kaftan, and accessorised with oversized sunglasses.

She channelled her inner model by posing with her hands on her hips, and wrote in the caption: 'Thanks to four-year-old Zayn for taking this pic! Little Legend.'

Rebel's Monaco holiday snap comes after she recently shared a video to Instagram of herself on a jet ski.

In one clip, Rebel couldn't wipe the excitement off her face as she glided across the harbour.

'Wooo.. Yeah baby,' she could be heard yelling.

While her 29-year-old beau was nowhere to be seen, it's most likely he was filming the footage.

Rebel also recently shared a short clip of herself cuddling up to Jacob on their yacht.

The new couple made their carpet debut at the Planetary Health Gala in Monaco last week.

Jacob's family founded the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which produces America's most popular beer, Budweiser.

In 2016, Forbes listed the Busch family as the 16th richest in America, with a fortune of $13.4billion.

The pair's 11-year age gap shouldn't be a problem for Jacob, who previously dated Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, 59. 

Meanwhile, Rebel continues to impress her social media followers with her incredible body transformation.

Back in January, she declared 2020 her 'year of health', and has so far lost at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone).

According to People magazine, Rebel's remarkable transformation is partially down to following the Mayr Method diet plan.

'It's an approach that eliminates food intolerances, reduces sugar, encourages eating whole foods slowly, boosts the immune system and reduces inflammation,' a source said.

'She exercises with a personal trainer up to six times a week, goes on walks and is trying to up her protein intake nutritionally.'

Meanwhile, her personal trainer Jono recently shared her workout routine with E! Australia.

During a typical week, Rebel does a combination of HIIT workouts, mobility, weights and resistance, and has just one day per week of rest.
