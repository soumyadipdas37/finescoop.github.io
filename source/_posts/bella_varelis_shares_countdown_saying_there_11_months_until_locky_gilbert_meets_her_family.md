The end of The Bachelor is fast approaching.

And it appears finalist Bella Varelis may have trouble keeping up with the fast-pacing dating show, as she made a rather awkward blunder on her social media account this week, 

In a plug the show's upcoming home visits on Wednesday, the 25-year-old teased: 'And then there was four...,' along with a countdown.

However, the date on her post was marked 11 months into the future, rather than 11 hours until the episode goes to air.

Bella swiftly deleted the post upon realising her mistake, and added instead 'can't wait for Locky to meet the most important people in my life.'

Sharing a photo of herself wearing a lace dress, the brunette went on to write: 'Who knew Survivor would be gearing Locky up to meet a protective Greek dad? p.s. dad is actually a big softie.'

Meanwhile, Locky will face his toughest challenge yet during Wednesday night's episode as he meets the families of his final four contenders .

And if the teaser trailer is anything to go by, Locky will be grilled by Bella's protective father as he issued a stern warning to the star.

'There's gonna be some hearts broken and the only heart that I care about is hers...' he warns.

To which, Locky replies: 'I totally understand that.' 

The episode will also see the hunk questioned about his views on feminism.

'I'm on The Bachelor, some people might think I'm not the best guy to talk about feminism,' Locky is heard saying in a piece to camera.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10 

Will she win? The remaining women competing for Locky's affections are Irena Srbinovska, Bella Varelis (pictured), Bec Cvilikas and Izzy Sharman-Firth
