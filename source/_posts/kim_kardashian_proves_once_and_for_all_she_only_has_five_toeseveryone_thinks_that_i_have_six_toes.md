Fans have speculated that Kim Kardashian has a sixth toe on her left foots since it seemed there was an extra toe in certain promotional photoshoots.

But the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star cleared the air once and for all video taping her foot and counting out each toe. 

In a series of videos posted to her Instagram story on Wednesday night, the 39-year-old called the theory she has an extra toe 'really wild.' 

Clearing the air: Kim Kardashian cleared the air once and for all on her theoried sixth toe, video taping her foot and counting out each toe proving there are only five

'Everyone thinks that I have six toes, and it's really wild,' she said while filming her foot.  

After counting her toes, noting there are only five, she pointed out it is part of the side and bottom of her foot that when pushed down in an open toed shoe can look like an extra foot digit. 

'But it's this, part of my foot, that when I wear a shoe just like this it like smashes down right here and in a picture,' Kim said. 'I don't know why, it looks like a sixth toe.'

Captioning the video 'very baffling.'

She went on to film a selfie video with her hair up in her signature sleek waterfall look. 

'I hope that answered my sixth toe question,' Kim said. 'Because I only have five toes on each foot.' 

She seemed to be enjoying time with friends as they could be hear loudly in the back, as she recorded herself in full glam makeup.  

Questions answered: 'I hope that answered my sixth toe question,' Kim said. 'Because I only have five toes on each foot' 

Last year while promoting the Kylie Jenner by KKW fragrance collaboration with her little sister, fans thought they spotted a Photoshop fail or an extra toe all together.   

Comments began calling out what appeared to be a Photoshop fail, with one fan joking, 'why you got six toes?' 

But it was Kim's left foot that caught fans' attention.

Extra toe? Kim's left foot caught fans' eyes but now the extra digit is explained

The TV personality wore clear stilettos on her one exposed foot - and it certainly looked like she had an extra digit.  

Fans - including gossip blogger Perez Hilton - couldn't resist poking fun of the toe.

'Am I tripping or does Kim have 6 toes? Someone explain, I'm so confused! I counted so many times,' another user said.

One user simply asked: 'six toes sis?' 

Perez joked 'that sixth toe is iconic.'
