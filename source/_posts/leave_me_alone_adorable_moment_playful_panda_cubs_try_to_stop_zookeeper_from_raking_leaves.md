Before entering the enclosure, Mei threw a broom over the fence to distract the cubs from possibly running out of the entrance.

The adorable pandas tumbled and rolled around playfully while two of them even managed to get their paws inside the basket of leaves.

One of the cubs started rolling inside the basket before Mei carried him out, struggling to keep the other panda away as she tried to complete her job.

A third person wrote: 'Just thinking about how this woman’s literal job is to clean the home of big furry chaotic toddles.' 

Wild pandas, which were considered an endangered, have now been upgraded to 'vulnerable' on the global list of species at risk of extinction, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced.

Lo Sze Ping, CEO of WWF-China, warned: 'Everyone should celebrate this achievement. But pandas remain scattered and vulnerable, and much of their habitat is threatened by poorly planned infrastructure projects. Remember, there are still only 1,864 left in the wild.'
