She is currently filming Nicole Kidman's new TV show Nine Perfect Strangers in Byron Bay, NSW. 

But earlier this month, Asher Keddie was spotted taking some time out from filming to enjoy a beach day with her five-year-old son, Valentino.

The 46-year-old flaunted her amazing physique in a black bikini as she soaked up the sun during the outing.

She had her blonde locks tied back into a bun and showcased her natural beauty, going makeup free.

Asher appeared relaxed and happy as she enjoyed a dip in the aqua blue waters with her son.

Asher showed off her taut torso and trim pins as she later cooled off in the water solo. 

The Australian beauty relocated to the NSW coastal town in order to film her upcoming TV series, Nine Perfect Strangers. 

However, her husband Vincent Fantauzzo, is stuck in lockdown in the couple's hometown of Melbourne as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 43-year-old artist revealed on Sunrise that he had been staying in touch with Asher through lots of 'FaceTime' and 'Zooming'. 

'Lucky Asher is in Byron Bay. She is making a TV show and I'm stuck here in cold lockdown,' he said. 

'There's a lot of Zooming and FaceTime chats going on.'

Vincent and Asher have been married since 2014.

In her interview with Marie Claire, Asher revealed how she first met her husband, and said she was immediately drawn to his 'chaotic' energy.

'When Vincent finally arrived, he was very dishevelled and chaotic-looking. There was an instantaneous and intense connection between us,' she said.

In 2015, they welcomed their first child together, a son named Valentino Fantauzzo. Vincent has an older son, Luca, from a previous relationship.
