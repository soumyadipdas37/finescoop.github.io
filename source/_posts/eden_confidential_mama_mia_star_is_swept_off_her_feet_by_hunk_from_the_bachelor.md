Lusting after someone you see on reality TV rarely leads to real-life romance, but that's what happened for West End star Georgina Castle. 

The 28-year-old daughter of Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle is courting Alex Marks, 33, after spotting him on Channel 5's The Bachelor, where 25 women compete for the affections of a handsome and eligible man. 

'We have mutual friends, so we'd made contact previously, but during lockdown I got into The Bachelor,' Georgina tells me.

'It was meant to be light relief, but I had no clue I'd end up quite liking him. 

'I reached out and we met for a socially distanced date and got drunk in Battersea Park.' 

And now she's on holiday in Greece with Alex, a personal trainer from Kent. 

Georgina, who starred in theatre hits Mamma Mia! and 9 To 5, admits that dating a fitness fanatic has its perks
