Michael McIntyre left Phillip Schofield mortified on Wednesday's episode of This Morning after he got him in trouble and asked about his new book.

The comedian, 44, appeared on the hit ITV series to discuss his new Netflix special show when chat soon turned to Phillip, 58.

At the end of the interview, Michael decided to grill Phillip where he asked about his new autobiography book Life's What You Make It. 

Awkward! Michael McIntyre left Phillip Schofield mortified on Wednesday's episode of This Morning after he got him in trouble and asked about his new book

To which the host was left mortified with co-presenter Holly Willoughby left equally shocked by the questions.

Michael said: 'Are you busy Phil? Aren't you writing a book, Phil?'

To which a coy and giggling Phillip replied: 'Yeah, I've done that... it's all done, all finished.'

Holly was left equally shocked as she squealed: 'Michael McIntyre!' then added: 'You are going to be in trouble now!' 

And as This Morning ended, it showed a visibly mortified Phillip clutch his hand in his face while Holly laughed hysterically.

Elsewhere in the interview, Michael shared details about his virtual lockdown quizzes with Phillip hosted by Holly and her husband Dan Baldwin.

The comedian let slip that the trio were joined by retired footballer Alan Shearer who would always beat him during the event.

Giggles: To which the host was left mortified with co-presenter Holly Willoughby left equally shocked by the questions as she squealed: 'Michael McIntyre!' 

Michael had been joking about how his illuminating light ring for remote filming made him look 'attractive' from afar but when he went closer, it reflected onto his glasses.

To which the trio revealed they had similar problems during their virtual lockdown quizzes, to which the comedian revealed he was shocked he finished so low down.

He said: 'I absolutely loved those quizzes until I came... actually rock bottom in them. It was quite, we were all so sad anyway underneath, but that was quite a blow actually! Can we name names?'

To which Holly replied: 'Yeah, I think so...'

Questions: Michael said: 'Are you busy Phil? Aren't you writing a book, Phil?' to which a coy and giggling Phillip replied: 'Yeah, I've done that... it's all done, all finished.'

Book date! Michael then asked when the book was being released to which Phillip shared: 'October 15th... I don't think I'm allowed to say, we're not allowed to talk about my stuff!'

With Michael adding: 'The Shearers kept coming quite low down, I thought we'd come ahead of the Shearers!'

With Holly joking that they did well during the sporting rounds, due to Alan's former career as a footballer, and a Geordie round as he is from Newcastle.      

In July, Phillip revealed that he had written a book about coming out as gay, which will be released in October.

The This Morning host issued a statement in February on social media declaring that after 27 years of marriage, he was 'coming to terms with the fact that I am gay'.

Taking to Instagram to announce the release of his book titled Life’s What You Make It, Phil admitted he had written the first line 'when [he] was 14' and said it was a 'deeply emotional' experience to write it.

Meanwhile Michael's appearance comes after he revealed that a joke about handwashing had been taken out of his Netflix special amid the coronavirus pandemic. He recorded the show in March ahead of the lockdown.  

The comedian told Jessie Ware on her podcast Table Manners: 'I did a joke about it [coronavirus]. I introduced myself on stage when all the handwashing stuff was starting.

'I said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together and wash them for 30 seconds as we welcome Michael McIntyre.' 

'I actually came on and said, 'This could be the last time we get together in a crowd.' I said it as a joke, I should never have said that.'

Asked if it remained, he said: 'No, I took all that stuff out. There are a few more jokes in the Netflix special which I'm hoping are still funny but it's worried me slightly. 

'I have jokes about face masks, but this was at a time no one in the world except people in Asia were wearing face masks.' 

This Morning continues on weekdays at 10am on ITV.
