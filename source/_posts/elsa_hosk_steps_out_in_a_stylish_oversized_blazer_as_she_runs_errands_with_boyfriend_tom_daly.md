She relocated to Los Angeles as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the United States, putting the country on a nationwide lockdown. 

But Elsa Hosk was back in New York and accompanied by boyfriend of five years Tom Daly on Sunday as the couple ventured out for a stroll. 

The Swedish model, 31, looked typically stylish in an oversized blazer while walking alongside Danish entrepreneur Tom following their return to the east coast.

With her toned legs on full display, Elsa caught the eye as they made their way across the sidewalk during a trip to the city's trendy SoHo district. 

She added to her look with a pair of casual running shoes, while heavily tinted sunglasses rounded things off.

In accordance with current safety guidelines, the model concealed her naturally pretty features beneath a protective face covering, as did Tom.

Elsa and Tom are back in New York after spending lockdown in southern California as the coronavirus crisis worsened.   

Speaking out during quarantine, Elsa told Instagram followers that although she lives in New York, she was very excited to be spending time in LA as she hopes to make it her permanent home one day.

In her two new informal Instagram series', 'Cooking with Elsa' and 'Ask Elsa' the model shows cooking recipes and also answers questions for her 6.2M fans.

Through these channels Elsa has also been open about her approach to eating and how she finds balance when it comes to keeping her top model figure but also indulging in things she likes.

'I eat pretty healthy but I also eat a lot of s*** like pizza, burgers. I love Shake Shack. It’s like my favorite thing to eat. I love pasta, but I also like salads and I also like really healthy foods,' she said.

During lockdown Elsa also scored a new contract with Creative Artists Agency and enjoyed a holiday to Jamaica before she and Tom decamped to California.
