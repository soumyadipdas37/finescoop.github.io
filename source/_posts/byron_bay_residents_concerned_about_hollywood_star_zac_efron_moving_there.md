Zac Efron has been staying in the Australian coastal town of Byron Bay for the last few months.

And rumours that the Hollywood star could move there permanently have upset a few local residents, who fear that the town is now losing its 'community atmosphere'.

In a post shared to a Byron Bay Facebook group, one local wrote: 'Byron Bay used to be inclusive. If you don't have a tonne of money forget it.

'Byron Bay used to be inclusive!' Some Byron Bay locals have expressed concerns about Zac Efron potentially moving to the coastal town 

'And by the way, I've lived in Byron Bay for nearly forty years, so it's got nothing to do with tall poppy [syndrome]. It's to do with losing the community atmosphere.

'Now it's all AirBnBs, this is what I don't like,' they finished.

Responding to the post, another resident wrote: 'Byron Bay has been destroyed for decades now, long before Efron ever went there. Hasn't been the hippie utopia it used to be.'

Another person wrote: 'They will inflate the prices, next thing the average Aussie can't afford to live there.'

Comedian Ed Kavalee, 41, said on Monday that Zac's presence in Byron Bay potentially spells disaster for locals. 

'No, no, just even hearing the words... I mean Byron was already teetering and now it's gone... that's terrible news!' he said on the Hughesy & Ed drive show.

Ed warned that an influx of American celebrities could soon follow if word spreads that Byron Bay is a haven for young Hollywood stars.

'Because where one goes, they all follow,' he said.

Ed's radio co-host Dave 'Hughesy' Hughes supported Zac and said that he would like to see more celebrities in Byron Bay. 

But Ed strongly disagreed, saying that a wave of famous actors would result in house prices going through the roof.

Having so many celebrities in town could also make it difficult for locals to gain entry to venues, he argued.

Ed explained: 'It's already expensive. Prices will go through the roof. You'll try and go to a café and they'll be like "Sorry, not today" and there's four people in there and it'll be Efron and his buddies and someone else!'

Dave said this was unfair, and pointed out that Zac 'blends in' with the locals and 'wants to hang out in Australia and live a real life'.

He also noted that famous Byron Bay locals, like Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky, don't get special treatment and are considered part of the community.

Zac, who has been living in Byron Bay for several months, is said to be dating a local woman named Vanessa Valladares.

They reportedly met in July when Vanessa, who is also a model, was working as a waitress at the Byron Bay General Store café.
