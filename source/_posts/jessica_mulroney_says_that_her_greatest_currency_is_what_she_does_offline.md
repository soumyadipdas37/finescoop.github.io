Jessica Mulroney has told that her 'greatest currency' is what she does offline - after being accused of not following through on her promises in the wake of 'race row' with influencer Sasha Exeter.

The stylist, 40, from Toronto, took to Instagram and re-posted a quote from @Sarah_Peretz which read: 'Don't use your life to highlight social media. Use social media to highlight your life.'

Alongside the quote, she penned: 'I’ve always believed my greatest currency is what I do offline. For some it’s reposting which is perfectly acceptable. 

'But those who choose to do the work offline, making impactful changes, I think that’s the work that needs to be highlighted. Not necessarily reposting slides, get out there and make a difference. 

'You may not be recognized for it, or immediately praised for it but it feels better than anything.

The Duchess  was reported to have cut ties with Jessica in the wake of the controversy, with a source telling the DailyMail.com at the time she was left 'mortified' by the scandal and informed her close friends she felt she could 'no longer be associated' with her.

'Meghan is absolutely mortified that she's been dragged into this complete mess. She said Jessica is in no way a racist, but the way she handled the situation [with Sasha] was tone-deaf and heartbreaking,' a close friend of Meghan's said at the time.

'Meghan said friends reflect friends and because of what's at stake she can no longer be associated with Jessica, at least not in public. 

Sasha Exeter, who went viral after exposing messages she received from Meghan Markle's stylist friend, took to her Instagram stories to reveal she had been receiving threatening emails all weekend

Toronto-based Influencer Sasha Exeter said she was left 'paralysed with fear' and 'stayed up days and nights' worrying about what Jessica (right) 'could be saying to my existing brand partners, potential work, potential livelihood'. The pair had a row over racism and Mulroney apparently not using her voice enough in a private exchange believed to have happened over Instagram direct messages 

'She has to do what she has to do in order to preserve her dignity and her own reputation,' the source added, admitting that they 'wouldn't be surprised' if the controversy was the 'beginning of the end of their friendship'.

But earlier this month Jessica shut down the rumours, branding a commenter's suggestion on one of her posts that she had been 'dumped' by Meghan 'fake news'.  

Finding Freedom, the explosive biography about the Sussexes written by journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, recently shed light on the history of Jessica's friendship with the Duchess.

It told how Meghan and Harry spent time with the Mulroneys, part of the Canadian political dynasty, before their relationship was made public in 2016, and 'hid out' at the family home when the news first broke.

It was there, the authors claim, that Meghan 'fell hard' for her now-husband after getting a 'first-hand glimpse of how Harry might be as a father'.

Jessica's friendship with Meghan was not the only aspect of her life that suffered as a result of the recent controversy.

The bond between Harry, Meghan and Mulroneys was clear to see when Brian (far left), John (far right) and Ivy (next to her brother) were all given important roles in the Sussexes' wedding.

Having quickly shot to fame thanks to her close friendship with the Duchess, Jessica's fall from grace was even swifter.

DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that ABC had quickly severed ties with her, confirming that Jessica would not be returning to her occasional role as a fashion contributor on Good Morning America.

Canadian TV network CTV also distanced themselves from the stylist, revealing that it was pulling all episodes of her wedding-focused reality show I Do Redo from its platforms ahead of its expected US premiere on Netflix.

Jessica then stepped down from the board of directors of The Shoebox Project, a charity that she founded with her sisters-in-law, Caroline, Vanessa, and Katy Mulroney.

Jessica appears to be taking steps towards making amends; earlier this month she revealed on Instagram that she has used some of her time away from the platform to work on a project to help 'marginalized communities across Canada'. 

Although the mother-of-three did not elaborate or offer any other details about the project, she did offer a potential hint in a follow-up Instagram Story post, in which she said: 'If anyone has old computers they no longer use, please DM me.'
