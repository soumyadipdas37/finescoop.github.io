AFL star Jimmy Bartel, 36, and his girlfriend Lauren Mand, 31, have celebrated their one year anniversary together. 

Taking to Instagram on Monday, Lauren shared an image of herself and Jimmy which had been 'turned yellow' - showing them as 'Simpsons' characters.    

'Three hundred and sixty five days. Thanks for the artwork, it's going straight to the pool room,' she wrote in tribute to the Cats legend.

The image had herself and Jimmy cuddling up on the iconic Simpson's couch, wearing matching tracksuits.

Over on Jimmy's Instagram, he also wished the blonde socialite a happy one year after being together. 

'One year with you,' he wrote, sharing the same image.

Last month, Lauren hinted the pair could be getting engaged after writing she had 'big news' after spending time with Jimmy in lockdown.

While her post certainly sounded like a personal announcement, it seems she was actually celebrating her younger sister's engagement. 

She subsequently shared a photo of her sister posing with her new fiancé below a balloon shaped like a diamond ring.

Jimmy and Lauren were first pictured as a couple in August 2019.

Nadia and Jimmy Bartel announced their separation on August 15 last year, but they are believed to have actually split two months prior.

They share custody of two children, sons Aston, four, and Henley, one.   

The pair married in February 2014 in a lavish ceremony on the Bellarine Peninsula.
