Piping hot water and a $5 dishwashing liquid is the secret to a sparkling shower screen, a mother has revealed.

The woman posted in an Australian cleaning group on Facebook, detailing how she filled a spray-top bottle with warm water, then squirted in Fairy 'Ultra Concentrate' which is available from leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.

Taking care not to shake the solution, she spritzed it over the glass and left it to soak for 20 minutes before wiping the surface with a soft, non-scratch sponge.

She was amazed to watch soap scum 'disappear' before her eyes, leaving the screen crystal clear without any trace of residue or hard water marks.

'Absolutely outstanding result on my bathroom this morning,' she wrote in the caption, before hailing Fairy liquid 'hands down the best cleaning product ever'. 

The post, which has gone viral since it was shared on Sunday, has drawn hundreds of amazed responses with comments including 'fantastic job' , 'outstanding' and 'I want your shower'. 

'I have severe shower screen envy,' one woman replied.

'Right, off to buy Fairy dishwashing liquid,' said a second, while a third added: 'This is magic.'

The technique even received the seal of approval from a professional cleaner, who said she only uses dishwashing liquid diluted with rinse aid and hot water on clients' home surfaces.

Others suggested adding white vinegar to the detergent and water solution for an even brighter, streak-free finish.

It's the latest home cleaning hack involving a Fairy product to sweep social media, following a mother's 'miracle' trick for turning her oven door from grimy to gleaming with a $7.50 dish spray.

An Australian mother used $7.50 Fairy 'Easy Spray' to transform the glass of her oven door from grimy (left) to gleaming (right), without breathing in toxic fumes emitted from chemical cleaners

The woman posted in popular Facebook group 'Mums Who Clean', detailing how she coated her grease-riddled glass with Fairy 'Easy Spray' while the oven was still warm, left it to soak for 10 minutes then wiped it with a soft non-scratch sponge.

Photos prove the stains lifted off easily, leaving the door crystal clear with just a few spritzes of the product that's available in leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.

She said the results left her 'lost for words' and vowed never to waste money on heavy-duty cleaning products again.

The photos have drawn delighted responses since they were shared on Friday, with comments including 'that's awesome', 'looks amazing' and 'I'm hunting this down tomorrow'.

One woman revealed how she gets more than her money's worth from the spray.

'It's quite expensive, so when my bottle is nearly empty I put in a squirt of dish detergent and a squirt of rinse aid, top it up with water and it seems to work just the same. Cheap refill,' she said.
