A carpenter who knew nothing about the beauty industry quit his day job in 2014 to launch a tanning business with his wife - and now earns $55,000 a day.

David Oosterloo, 32, and his wife Laura are the multi-millionaires behind one of Australia's most lucrative skincare brands, Bali Body. 

They were on holiday in the Indonesian country their brand is named after when the pair started to talk about what sort of tanning products and sunscreens exist for people with sensitive skin types.

'My wife Laura has suffered from eczema throughout her life and the demand for a natural sun-care range became obvious as her skin continued to flare each time she used sunscreen and tanning oils,' David, who lives in Melbourne, told news.com.au.

Realising that there were very few sensitive skin products of this nature in the beauty market, David and Laura curated a host of oils made out of coconut oil, watermelon seed oil and grape seed oil, to name a few.

Before long they were being sported by every major 'influencer' on social media, garnering the brand 1.4million followers. Bali Body is tagged on an Instagram image every 10 minutes.

They now sell 34 products - including their best-seller $29.95 Self Tanning Mousse - to 150 countries worldwide.

The self tanning mousse's streak-free and fast drying formula is said to be the reason the product has sold out three times internationally.

David told the publication that Bali Body made $20 million in sales in the past year alone, which equates to a $55,000 pay check a day

'So much has changed over the years, we have become business minded, the brand and team have evolved and matured,' he said.

'I guess you could definitely say we have grown with the brand, but not changed in terms of who we are as people.'

In June the Original Bronzed Bundle priced at $68.95, which contains the must-have self tanning mousse, face tan water and a luxe tanning mitt, had 3,400 customers waiting for stock to be replenished.

The second Ultra Bronzed Bundle priced at $69.95 also had a waiting list of 2,800 people.

Both the original and dark tanning products are enriched with nourishing oils and 100 per cent natural DHA to create a smooth, natural-looking bronze tan every time.

The mousse promises a 'flawless natural looking tan' and 'no self tan smell' as well as soothing chamomile extract, antioxidant coffee seed extract and rejuvenating pomegranate extract to leave skin glowing.

The brand has received thousands of five-star reviews online.

'I have used so many other self tan products but this is by far my favourite! It looks natural and lasts through the week, even with daily showers and going for swims in the pool,' one customer said.

'Skin looks so tan, there's hardly any smell at all, and it blends so well! 10/10 would recommend!' Another said.

'It looks very dark at first but after you leave it on and wash it off it leaves a natural glow! I am very satisfied with this purchase and will be buying again!' A third said.
