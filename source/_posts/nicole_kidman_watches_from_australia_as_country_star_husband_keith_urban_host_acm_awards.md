She may be hunkering down in Australia.

But Nicole Kidman made sure to tune in to watch her country star husband Keith Urban live as he hosted the ACM Awards in Nashville this Wednesday.

The 53-year-old platinum blonde actress shared a sweet Instagram clip of herself beaming as she watched the show on a laptop.

Best wishes from Byron Bay: Nicole Kidman made sure to tune in to watch her country star husband Keith Urban live as he hosted the ACM Awards in Nashville this Wednesday

'Wishing I was there, but streaming @KeithUrban on the #ACMAwards here in #ByronBay [heart] #Nashville,' she wrote in her caption. 

'I believe it’s about community,' Keith could be seen saying onstage in the segment of the show Nicole was watching. 

'The songs, the stories and the artists that tell ‘em – they bring us healing, comfort, and they bring hope and we sure could use some of that right about now, don’t you think?' he asked the audience watching at home.

The awards show extravaganza blends live and pre-taped segments and be held across three Nashville landmarks, facilitating social distancing. 

Hot couple: Nicole and Keith, who rang in their 14th wedding anniversary this summer, are pictured attending the CMA Awards in Nashville last November

One was the Grand Ole Opry where Keith performed his hosting duties and the others were the Ryman Auditorium and Bluebird Cafe. 

The Grand Ole Opry was celebrating 95 years since its foundation, as marked by Carrie Underwood in a medley of songs by legendary country ladies.

Her barnstorming performance that evening included nods to such icons as Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline, Reba McEntire and Loretta Lynn.

Keith and Nicole were first introduced to one another in January 2005 at G'Day LA, an event for Hollywood Australians, and they married in Sydney on June 25, 2006.

Place to be: One was the Grand Ole Opry where Keith performed his hosting duties and the others were the Ryman Auditorium and Bluebird Cafe

Both of them are Australians - Keith was born in New Zealand but raised outside Brisbane, while Nicole was born in Honolulu and brought up in Sydney. 

Before her romance with Keith she was married to her Eyes Wide Shut co-star Tom Cruise with whom she adopted her children Isabella, 27, and Connor, 25. 

She and Keith have gone on to have two more daughters together - a 12-year-old called Sunday and a nine-year-old called Faith.
