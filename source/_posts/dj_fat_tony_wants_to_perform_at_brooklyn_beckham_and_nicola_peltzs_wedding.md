DJ Fat Tony has insisted he wants to perform at Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz's forthcoming wedding ceremony. 

The musician spoke candidly about his intentions on Fubar Radio's Access All Areas show on Thursday, and also gushed about his friendship with the family.

Chatting with Bobby Norris and Stephen Leng, Tony said of potentially hitting the decks at the wedding: 'Who knows about that. If I'm not there's going to be bloody trouble, let's just say that!'

Going on to talk about his close relationship with the Beckham family, he went on: 'I love Victoria and I love David and love all the kids. They get a raw deal man sometimes and all they do is good things.

'They are an incredible family… and those kids are the most charming kids you'll ever want to meet, so polite. 

'And there's no like, I'm Romeo Beckham, there's none of that stuff whatsoever. It's incredible, it really is.'

Honest: Tony said of potentially DJing Brooklyn's forthcoming nuptials: 'Who knows about that. If I'm not there's going to be bloody trouble, let's just say that!'

Fat Tony DJ'ed Brooklyn's 21st birthday, which took place at the family's £6 million Cotswolds home, and was reported to have cost £100,000 at the time.  

The son of David and Victoria was also treated to a concert by rapper Stormzy and monogrammed drinks as he let his hair down until 6am with his nearest and dearest. 

While, for her birthday in April, Victoria hosted a 'virtual party' with the DJ on Instagram Live, and he played a medley of her favourite tracks so her fans could 'turn the music up and have a dance.'

Brooklyn recently referred to Nicola as 'my wife' in a sweet Instagram post last month, appearing to confirm speculation they have already married in secret.  

The photographer set tongues wagging when he showed off a gold band on his wedding finger, with his followers asking if the pair had already married in secret.

Appearing to confirm the union, the son of David and Victoria Beckham, commented 'my wife' on a smitten snap of the pair - which Nicola had captioned 'My forever'.

Wedding speculation started last month when Nicola shared a cryptic snap of a gold ring on Brooklyn's finger. 

The image shared to Nicola's Instagram Stories showed the couple clutching a label, with Brooklyn sporting a gold band on his left hand.   

Brooklyn's mother Victoria then uploaded a snap of her son alongside his younger brother Cruz, 15, with a gold ring visible on his wedding finger.

Brooklyn took to Instagram in July to announce his engagement to Nicola following reports he had popped the question to his 'soulmate' after just eight months of dating.

Sharing a stunning snap of the couple, he wrote: 'Two weeks ago I asked my soulmate to marry me and she said yes xx

'I am the luckiest man in the world. I promise to be the best husband and the best daddy one day. I love you baby xx.'
