Lucy Hale stepped out with a new hair color Monday while out with her beloved dog Elvis in Los Angeles.

The 31-year-old actress showed off new red tresses as she switched from her normal brunette look.

The Pretty Little Liars star wore a white tank top, brown trousers and comfortable white sneakers while walking Elvis on a sidewalk.

The Truth Or Dare star recently gushed over her pup in an Instagram post.

Lucy has become so devoted to Elvis (or Elvy as she likes to call him) that she got his name inked in cursive on her arm earlier this year.

The Memphis native portrayed title character Katy Keene in The CW spin-off of Riverdale that premiered in February, but the series was canceled in July after one season.

Lucy had a starring role in the Fantasy Island supernatural horror film that was released on February 14 in theaters.

The prequel to the 1977 ABC television series earned $48 million worldwide against a production budget of $7 million.
