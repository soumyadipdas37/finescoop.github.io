A cardigan is a warm and stylish wardrobe staple that's perfect for when the temperature drops.

Shoppers have been snapping up autumnal fashion essentials on Amazon, from oversized jumpers and comfy joggers to snuggly fleeces and this cosy Abollria Waterfall Cardigan.

Not only is the cardigan made from a warm yet lightweight blend of cotton and polyester, but it's also soft and comfortable. 

The Abollria Waterfall Cardigan is soft, comfortable and affordable - the perfect fall staple

Featuring an open front that falls to the top of the knees to flatter the figure, the cardigan boasts full-length sleeves in two styles, a longline silhouette and pockets.

While it's still racking up reviews (800 and counting), over 60 per cent of shoppers have given it a perfect five-star rating. And at just £16.99, depending on what size and colour you pick, the Abollria Waterfall Cardigan is pretty affordable, too.

Customers who have tried the cardigan love that it's 'well made' and 'fits beautifully'.

'The lightweight woman's cardigan is perfect for any season,' raved one customer. 'Simply throw on a t-shirt underneath and wear it in a summers night, or layers it on for the winter. The beige colour goes well with anything. Cardigans are easy to dress up or down and still look great.'
