Mia was treated by Maya as part of Coca-Cola's Open Like Never Before campaign and as rewarded for her positive attitude during lockdown after being made redundant from her job of six years and missing out on her first wedding anniversary.

The fan then followed her dream of being a designer and has set up her own business selling personalised illustrations, cards and gifts.

Maya Jama said: 'It was amazing to team up with Coca-Cola to surprise Mia. 

'She's shown such a great attitude and strength of spirit throughout the pandemic, really embracing that sense of positivity, and so it made total sense to surprise her.'

The surprise comes after Maya graced the cover of Wonderland Magazine for a sensational new shoot with an accompanying interview detailing her feelings on the industry and how she will struggle with acting

The TV presenter, radio star and model, 26, graced the cover of the Autumn 2020 edition of Wonderland Magazine for a sensational new shoot with an accompanying interview detailing her feelings on the industry. 

The TV and radio host said: 'I definitely think I'm resilient. Sometimes I surprise myself, because there's been a few times...

'I feel like oh my God, this is the end of the world — and then it's not the end of the world. And then I'm back.'

The stunning shoot came after Maya recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs.

The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.  

Speaking during a Q&A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it's like, 'This is this, it's everybody's business'.

Maya Jama said: 'It was amazing to team up with Coca-Cola to surprise Mia. She’s shown such a great attitude and strength of spirit throughout the pandemic, really embracing that sense of positivity, and so it made total sense to surprise her.'

Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heavy Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.  

He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew's still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. 

'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn't down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that's my one desire.'
