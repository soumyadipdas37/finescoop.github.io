Courtney Stodden left little to the imagination as she flaunted her figure in a tiny patterned bikini while posing for sizzling beach snaps.

The 26-year-old took to Instagram on Wednesday where she shared a series of images of her cavorting on a beach in Malibu, California.

Courtney, who recently dated Brian Austin Green following his split from Megan Fox, oozed confidence as she clambered onto a rock, before seductively laying on the sand.

The star was keen to showcase her slimline figure in the barely-there two-piece which featured a floral pattern in hues of red and blue. 

The halterneck top struggled to contain Courtney's very ample assets, while the thong bottoms put her peachy posterior on full display.

Courtney left her blonde tresses loose for the snaps, while she added a generous palette of make-up to her face.

The star posed with her hands atop her head, while accessorising her beach look with rounded black sunglasses, large silver hoop earrings and a gold arm cuff. 

Last month, Courtney turned up the heat in a sizzling Instagram video, determined to grab attention for her latest single. 

The blonde put on an alluring display in a skimpy animal print bikini as she poured oil down her chest and writhed around to her new song Side Effects.

'Go obsess over it!!!!' Courtney captioned the clip which saw her next to a pool and holding a champagne glass full of what appeared to be body oil.

Courtney previously said her new song is inspired by her brief fling with Brian Austin Green. 

'Side Effects is about that feeling you have when you leave an entanglement,' the Instagram model told Fox News of the track.

Courtney explained that the song is 'inspired by that recent entanglement' with the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum, 47.

'You got a bad dose of a bad actor and just want to be sober again,' said the singer/model. 'The high isn't worth the side effects.'

Courtney, who's starred on The Mother Daughter Experiment and Celebrity Big Brother, said that the brief romance with Brian was 'the catalyst' behind the song, which she said was 'inspired' by her 'love life,' as well as 'the repercussions many of us women face when being used.'

Lyrics include: 'And now I'm so tired /Tired of it, I get so sick /Dealing with your Side /Side Effects, your side effects /You don't know how hard it gets /When I suffer from your side effects /And now I'm so tired, Tired of it /Your side effects.'

Courtney said she blocked Brian's number after 'several other women who he was playing came forward' to her at the time they were seeing one another.

'I stand with them and I believe them,' Courtney said, calling the veteran actor 'a womanizer' who wanted to keep their romance 'his little secret.'
