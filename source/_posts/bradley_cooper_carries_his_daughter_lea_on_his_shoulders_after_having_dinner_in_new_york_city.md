Bradley Cooper proved he was a doting father on Saturday night as he carried his daughter Lea home from dinner.

The 45-year-old filmmaker had his adorable three-year-old on his shoulders after they enjoyed a dad and daughter date out in Manhattan's West Village.

The American Sniper actor was back on the East Coast after he was seen late last month filming scenes for director Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up to 2017's acclaimed film Phantom Thread.

In contrast with his bearded film character, who is rumored to be former hairstylist and later film producer Jon Peters, Bradley appeared to be sporting a clean-shaven face, though he kept his brown hair shaggy.

The Silver Linings Playbook star wore a casual tan jacket over a white shirt and navy blue pants, along with weathered brown boots. 

Lea looked cute in her baby blue hoodie and light blue jeans, and she wore tiny shoes with Velcro fasteners.

The actor and his daughter were both safety conscious and wore masks, with Bradley sporting a simple black Evolve Together design while she wore an eye-catching tie-dye look.

The two appeared to be alone for their meal, but Bradley regularly co-parents with his ex Irina Shayk, 34, when he's in New York City.

The former pair was most recently seen together earlier this month as they enjoyed a family day around the city.

Bradley and Irina began their relationship in June 2015, and in March of 2017 they welcomed their daughter.

However, the couple never married, and they separated in June 2019, following months of rumored tensions between them.

The eight-time Academy Award nominee was previously in a relationship with the model and actress Suki Waterhouse from 2013 to 2015, and prior to that he dated actress Zoe Saldana.

Cooper was married to actress Jennifer Esposito in December 2006, though she filed for divorce by May of the following year.

Following his success directing and starring in the Oscar-winning remake of A Star Is Born, Bradley will return to star in Guillermo del Toro's remake of the classic film noir Nightmare Alley, which has an all-star cast featuring Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Toni Collette and Willem Dafoe.

Coming soon: Bradley will try to repeat his success with A Star Is Born in the biopic Bernstein, in which he'll direct and star as the legendary conductor, composer and music educator Leonard Bernstein

He's also hoping to repeat his success with A Star Is Born in the biopic Bernstein, in which he'll direct and star as the legendary conductor, composer and music educator Leonard Bernstein.

Little is known about the portrait of Bernstein, which is currently in preproduction, and Succession's Jeremy Strong is the only other actor currently attached to the project in an unspecified role.

Cooper will return to the Marvel fold in the near future with an upcoming third volume of Guardians Of The Galaxy.

He voices the animated character Rocket Raccoon in the series and most recently appeared in Avengers: Endgame. 

Busy schedule: He'll also be appearing in the upcoming Paul Thomas Anderson film, possibly as film producer and hairstylist Jon Peters, and in Guillermo del Toro's Nightmare Alley adaptation; shown in November 2019
