Kim Kardashian is continuing to focus on herself amid a somewhat crazed period.

The 39-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star again took to her Instagram Monday night, this time uploading a trio of sultry swimsuit selfies in which she was seen lounging in an infinity pool in a snakeskin string bikini.

Kim wore deformed silver hoop earrings, and sported an on-trend body-length braid extension in the sexy snaps.

It looked like she was lounging in her mother Kris Jenner's infinity pool at the family's multimillion dollar La Quinta estate near Palm Springs, as the setting resembled her elder sister Kourtney's pool photo shoot from earlier this summer with new bestie Addison Rae. 

Kim captioned the post simply with 'Night Swim', taking advantage of the moment to relax – in the third snap, the mother-of-four made kissy lips while holding a cocktail and wearing wraparound sunglasses at night. 

Clearly, Kim's had a lot going through her head lately, telling fans early Monday that she unable to sleep since long before sunrise.

Sharing a black and white text post to her Instagram Story, the reality superstar said: 'Been up since 4:45am. Can't sleep. Do I get a head start on my workout or try and go back to sleep?'

Kim's restless night came as it's said that the mother-of-four is 'deeply disappointed and sad' about husband Kanye West's ongoing mental health struggles, according to Us Weekly.

That, plus the impending conclusion to the reality series that's defined much of her public life, as E!'s reality phenomenon Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be ending next year after 20 seasons.

Instead of trying to go back to sleep or workout, the aspiring lawyer found an even better option, sharing photos of herself pouring over notes, flashcards and books from her legal studies.

Restless: Sharing a black and white text post to her Instagram Story, the 39-year-old star said: 'Been up since 4:45am. Can't sleep. Do I get a head start on my workout or try and go back to sleep?'

'Gonna study,' she shared around 5:30am. 

It didn't seem too different from the star's usual routine. 

Last year she told sister Kourtney's lifestyle site Poosh she likes to get up around '5:45 am for my workout at 6 am.'

It seemed like early morning study time was the start of a busy day for Kim, whose next stop was the gym.

She had a few workout buddies this morning, sharing a photo of three pairs of sneaker-clad feet that belonged to sister Khloe Kardashian, her on-again beau Tristan Thompson, and the diva herself.

'Early bird special,' the Skims founder wrote on top.

Kimberly's baby bout of insomnia comes after reports she's been feeling down over husband Kanye's ongoing struggle with his mental health.  

The KUWTK alum is reportedly worried about the 'vicious cycle' her husband is experiencing, after a series of bizarre Twitter rants and posting a video of him appearing to urinate on one of his Grammys statues.

A source told Us Weekly: 'She is deeply disappointed and sad because Kanye is struggling. It's a vicious cycle that Kim has had success at interrupting successfully for months at a time.'

They went on to say how Kim knows it is difficult for Kanye 'being isolated and alone'. 

'Being isolated and alone essentially in his head isn't healthy for Kanye ... She doesn't care about the tweets, that is Kanye being Kanye. The mood swings and the manic episodes that are extremely difficult for Kim to help Kanye cope with.'

Meanwhile, Kim wants to 'be there' for Kanye.

The insider said: 'Kim is holding onto her marriage with Kanye and knows that he is bipolar and struggling with his mental health and wants to be there for him and help. She is continuing to support him and does her best to understand him and where he is coming from. She knows he is unconventional and has always known that.'

Kim is still 'focused on healing her relationship' despite the difficulties.

One insider said: 'Kim is focused on healing her relationship with Kanye and has been busy taking care of their kids and him. She has been helping and supporting him a ton while he's been struggling with his mental health and wants him to know and feel that she is there for him through thick and thin ... 

'The quarantine has been hard on Kanye and, in turn, has been difficult for her too. Their marriage definitely faced some hardships and was just hanging on with Kanye not being able to fully be present for their family, but ultimately Kim wants to keep everyone together and work things out for their kids.'
