AJ Pritchard has revealed that he would have loved to have been part of Strictly's first same-sex couple. 

The professional dancer, 25, announced earlier this year that he had quit the hit BBC One dance show after joining in 2016.   

Former boxer Nicola Adams, 37, is set to become the first celebrity contestant in Strictly's history to be paired with a woman when the show returns next month.

New interview: AJ Pritchard has revealed that he would have loved to have been part of Strictly's first same-sex couple 

Talking about the decision, AJ revealed that he would have loved to have been part of the show's first same-sex couple and it is one of the 'most important things' the show has ever done. 

He told The Sun: 'I'd have definitely been up for it. It's probably one of the most important things the show has done. I'm intrigued to see how the choreography works.'

AJ added: 'I know certain pro dancers would like to dance with a woman because that is what tradition is, and it kind of makes sense but it is very much down to someone's personal opinion of what ballroom and Latin dancing actually is.

'My view is, for example with ballroom and Latin, they do same-sex competitions for under 12s and there are usually more girls than boys who want to dance and so there would be all-girl partnerships.' 

Sad times: The professional dancer, 25, announced earlier this year that he had quit the hit BBC One dance show after joining in 2016 

He added that dancing is about 'telling the story' and it doesn't matter if it's 'two men or two women' performing.   

It comes after the BBC defended having a same-sex pairing on this year's series of Strictly Come Dancing earlier this week after more than 100 people complained.

In a statement the corporation said the competition is an 'inclusive show' and they are 'proud' to have had same-sex numbers in previous series.

Former boxer Nicola, 37, is set to become the first celebrity contestant in Strictly's history to be paired with a woman when the show returns in five weeks.

The BBC said: 'Strictly Come Dancing is an inclusive show and is proud to have featured same sex dancing amongst the professional dancers in group numbers in previous series.

'We have stated, in the past, that we are open to the prospect of including same sex pairings between our celebrities and professional dancers, should the opportunity arise.'

'Nicola Adams requested an all-female pairing, which we are happy to facilitate. The show is first and foremost about dance, the sex of each partner within a coupling should have no bearing on their routine.'

Last year male professional dancers Johannes Radebe and Graziano Di Prima performed a same sex routine during the show's seventeenth series.

While the dance - conducted during a performance by pop star Emeli Sande - was met with an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response on social media, it prompted 200 complaints with TV regulator Ofcom.

On Wednesday it was revealed that the BBC has already received complaints from some viewers about Nicola's upcoming same-sex pairing on Strictly Come Dancing.

The competition isn't due to start for five more weeks, but more than 100 people have already complained after a statement was posted online by the broadcaster.

MailOnline contacted Strictly and Nicola's representative for a comment at the time.

Nicola recently spoke about her upcoming appearance on the show, saying she is ready to 'break boundaries' as part of first same-sex couple in show's history

Setting the tone: Nicola enters the competition after male professionals Johannes Radebe and Graziano Di Prima performed a same sex routine during the show's seventeenth series in 2019

She told the Guardian: 'I guess it's just breaking those boundaries and showing people that it's OK.

'It's not such an uncommon thing: professional dancers dance with people of the same sex all the time; you dance in a nightclub with your friends.

'I just wanted to break down the thing of it being a big deal when it's not really a big deal.'

With her dance partner yet to be confirmed, Nicola believes she will be given the male role when the show gets underway because of her aversion to traditionally feminine clothes, adding: 'Dresses aren't my thing.'

For Nicola, her same-sex routines will be another opportunity to redefine the woman's role after being subjected to criticism as an ambitious teenager keen to make her mark in a largely male dominated sport.

Complaints: Ahead of Strictly returning to TV in five weeks time, the BBC has already received complaints from people about Nicola's pairing (pictured during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games)

Recalling some of the comments directed at her by coaches, she said: 'Like: 'Why don't you play tennis?' or: 'Women should be in the kitchen cooking.' You'd hear comments like that all the time.'

The former boxer is also aware of her position as an openly gay woman in the public eye, and with it her place as an LGBTQ+ role model to the younger generation.

She added: 'I know there will be kids who are struggling. And I'd just like them to know that it doesn't matter about your sexuality or what colour you are, you really can achieve anything you want to if you work hard.'

Filming for the new series is reportedly scheduled to begin in September, with the professional dancers' group routines to be pre-recorded after they completed two weeks in isolation.

The show is set to begin on October 24 with a one-off launch show on 12.
