A unique cleaning sponge called the Scrub Daddy is making waves in Australia for its ability to remove dirt and debris from kitchen pots and pans, shower screens, BBQs and couches - without the need for chemical soaps.

American founder Aaron Krause is the most successful businessman ever to appear on Shark Tank USA after he debuted the Scrub Daddy sponge in October 2012. According to the CEO magazine the company is worth US$170million (AU$235million).

But now Australians can finally get their hands on the Mrs Hinch-approved sponge, after it became available at a selection of online retailers in the southern hemisphere, including Catch.

It will also launch in Coles supermarkets this October. 

The product's patented FlexTexture material changes based on your water temperature, so it will become firm in cold water for tough scrubbing or soft in warm water for light cleaning.

It's scratch-resistant so customers don't have to worry about non-stick surfaces or even your car's exterior paintwork, and it rinses completely after washing with water alone.

Aaron has also developed Scrub Mummy, which is a scrubber and sponge in one, a Sponge Daddy (right)for a wider surface area and a Scour Daddy for tough baked-on stains

To clean the Scrub Daddy, which is available in a number of colours to avoid cross-contamination, you only need to put it on the top rack of your dishwasher or heat it up in a microwave.
