Premier League clubs fear a PR backlash if they do not organise a speedy cash bailout for financially troubled EFL clubs.

Sportsmail understands there are opposing opinions among top-flight teams on providing financial relief and talks are ongoing between the leagues. But EFL chairman Rick Parry said Wednesday he remained 'optimistic' of finding a solution.

While some clubs are sceptical about providing EFL clubs with a handout, others — primarily the smaller clubs — are far more sympathetic.

The extension of playing matches behind closed doors because of increasing Covid-19 rates will add to clubs' financial concerns.

There is a growing acceptance that top-flight clubs will have to inject cash into the EFL to keep several teams afloat, knowing that not doing so will have grave consequences and will damage the Premier League's image.

Some club officials want to avoid a scenario where it appears they are offering financial support under duress; or, even worse, not giving them any money at all.

There is a belief that the Government are reluctant to include the Premier League and EFL in a financial relief fund for UK sport after plans to reintroduce fans were scrapped on Tuesday.

Parry said he was disappointed at the Government's decision on fans.

The EFL have warned that their clubs will collectively lose £200million in matchday revenue and other benefits if the whole 2020-21 season has to be played behind closed doors.

'Over many months we have helped the Government devise, refine and pilot stringent stadium protocols to keep supporters safe,' said Parry. 'We are deeply frustrated that we will not be able to continue this work.'
