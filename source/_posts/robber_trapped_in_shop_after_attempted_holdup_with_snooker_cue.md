This is the moment a bungling robber trapped himself inside a shop after threatening staff with a snooker cue.

Jack Burrell, 19, was high on cocaine when he burst into the Local 4U store in Bulwell, near Nottingham, to grab cash to buy more drugs.

However, he damaged the front door of the shop which meant he was unable to open it when he tried to flee after staff refused to open the till.

CCTV shows Burrell almost falling over when he barged his way into the shop at 8pm on December 28 last year.

After failing to intimidate staff he fled empty-handed but the footage shows him desperately trying to open the doors.

Burrell made several failed attempts to prise open the sliding doors before running into the glass only to fall over.

He finally kicked a hole in the glass before shoulder charging his way out which left him sprawled on the pavement.

He ran just 50 yards before being wrestled to the ground by witnesses.

Burrell, of Bestwood Park, Nottinghamshire, was jailed for two years after admitting attempted robbery and possession of Class A drugs at Nottingham Crown Court.

After the case on Monday, September 21, Detective Sergeant Jon Kerry, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'Burrell decided to threaten shop workers with a weapon simply because he wanted to buy some more drugs and didn't have the means to buy any.

'These are people who are serving the public and should never have to face that kind of abuse and fear.

'Thankfully no one was hurt, no money was taken and Burrell was stopped by a brave member of the public who saw the incident unfolding and stepped in.

'Now he has had to go to court to face up to his actions.'

The court heard Burrell had blown £150 on cocaine before deciding to rob the shop in a bid to get more cash for more drugs.

The brave employees refused to hand over money to Burrell, who had his hood up, and was brandishing the snooker cue.

When he realised he wasn't getting any money, he turned round to discover he was trapped in the shop as he had damaged the door on the way in.

He ran toward an entrance at the back of the store but couldn't get out there either so returned to the front.

Burrell started kicking and shoulder barging the door until it cracked and he managed to force his way out.

But he was tackled by a delivery driver who had witnessed the raid and he managed to restrain him nearby until police arrived.
