Kaia Gerber and Jacob Elordi enjoyed a later dinner in Malibu on Tuesday.

The top model, 18, and Euphoria actor, 23, kept a low profile as they met up at the celeb-beloved Nobu Malibu around 9pm. 

But they weren't the only dinner guests that night, as Kaia carried her new dog Milo in her arms.

Kaia was It Girl cool in a black blouse and distressed jeans she paired with brown work boots.

She had her newly highlighted hair tucked behind her ears and a mask covering her face as she sauntered out of the shoreside eatery holding her pooch around 11pm.

Aussie hunk - who is rumored to be dating Zendaya - was right ahead of her, dressed down in a vintage Looney Toons tee shirt riffing on James Dean'st Rebel Without A Cause, jeans, and a newsboy cap.

After dinner, he, Kaia and the canine hopped into his Range Rover and drove off.

While the pair definitely seemed close, there didn't appear to be anything romantic between the two.

Kaia and Jacob run in a similar circle, both cloth pals with actor Tommy Dorfman.

Last week the Kissing Booth actor and 13 Reasons Why talent enjoyed a getaway to the resort town of Whitefish, Montana, where they shared a number a cozy Instagrams from.

Last September the Tommy/Kaia/Jacob clique was seen leaving the French fashion house's Paris fashion show together.

Jacob has kept quite quiet about his love life, but seems to meet his ladies on set. 

He previously dated Kissing Booth co-star Joey King but has most recently been linked to his Euphoria co-star Zendaya.

The Aussie actor and former Disney Channel star sparked romance rumors earlier this year after being spotted in NYC and Jacob's native Australia together, but have since been quarantining on separate continents.

The last time they were seen together was in March at an LA flea market.
