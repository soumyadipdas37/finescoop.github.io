A stepmother has been cleared of wrongdoing after being accused of participating in sex acts with her teenage stepson.

The woman was accused of encouraging her stepson to perform oral sex on her including an act called the 'alphabet game' over a period of two years in Melbourne.

At the time she was said to be 25 and 26, while the boy was only a teenager around 13 or 14.

A a trial by judge found there was insufficient evidence to prove the woman was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 

The Melbourne woman had been charged with two counts of gross indecency with a person under the age of 16, and two counts of incest.

She was accused of a series of vile acts between 1985 to 1987, Newscorp reported.

This included allegations she had performed oral sex on the teenager, and that the pair had penetrative sex.

But she told the court she had never participated in any 'amorous or sexual conduct' with her stepson. 



She had already been convicted over the charges twice after two separate trials by jury but the charges were thrown out after an appeal.

The woman was allowed to walk free after an appearance before Judge Michael Bourke at the Country Court of Victoria this week.

In handing down the sentence Judge Michael Bourke said he was unable to find enough evidence to convict her. 

He said while the accuser appeared trustworthy and reliant he was unable to make his judgement based off a personal opinion.   

'The complainant presented as honest and apparently reliable in his account of the alleged conduct charged,' he said.

'However, I am obliged to go beyond such subjective assessment.

'There is no support for the complainant's (account) of the amorous grooming behaviour.'
