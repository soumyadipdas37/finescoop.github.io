Mariah and Nick were married on April 30, 2008 after a whirlwind romance, but decided to separate in 2014. 

'Honestly, I think Nick and I could have worked it out between the two of us, but egos and emotions got inflamed (which can translate into many billable lawyer hours, and ultimately it did),' she wrote. 

Nearly two years after ending their romantic relationship, their union was officially dissolved and they were legally divorced in 2016.

'It was tough. We both wanted to make sure everything was cool for our family,' she said. 'We will always be family, and we make it work.'

Mariah met Nick at the Teen Choice Awards when he presented her with a surfboard award, and she was instantly enamored with his 'perpetual teen spirit.' 

'Our desire to have children became a force of nature and why we got married so quickly,' she wrote.

They welcomed twins Morrocan and Monroe on their wedding anniversary in 2011.  

Carey wrote that she felt 'safe' with Cannon and the 'power dynamics felt even' compared to her previous marriage to music executive Tommy Mottola. 

'He was a good guy. He was faith-based. He was ambitious,' she wrote. 'He had been in the entertainment industry for a long time, so he understood the madness. He paid attention to me.'

Despite the difficult time, Mariah and Nick have put on a united front for the sake of their children and are often spotted enjoying time together as a family.
