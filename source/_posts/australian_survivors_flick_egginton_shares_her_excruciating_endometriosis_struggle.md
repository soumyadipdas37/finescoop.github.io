Australian Survivor All Stars contestant Felicity 'Flick' Egginton has opened up about living with a crippling condition.

The 27-year-old, who starred on Australian Survivor in 2016 and then returned for the show's All Stars season this year, revealed that she suffers from stage two endometriosis in an emotional post this week.

Flick said that she went public with her condition to empower others experiencing symptoms to 'go and get checked' by a doctor.

'If something doesn't feel right. Get it checked. No matter what is going on in your life, please look after your health. It truly is the most important thing,' she told her Instagram followers in her post on Wednesday. 

Flick added she had always 'felt embarrassed and ashamed to talk' about the pain and symptoms she was experiencing, which she initially believed were 'my normal'.

The blonde beauty always had 'extremely painful periods along with tummy pains and cramps a lot of the days throughout the month', and did not realise there was a problem until recently.

'I've been dealing with excruciating pains when I have my period, after intercourse, when I am ovulating and also randomly throughout the month,' Flick said. 

'Along with breakthrough bleeding and unpredictable periods, I have had issues with urgency of the toilet in the morning and HORRIBLE stabbing pain.

'If I don't pass urine or gas when I need to, it turns into a deep ache that lasts for hours. 

'I have back aches and the worst headaches too during and around that time of the month. '

She explained that one in 10 women suffer from endometriosis 'at some point in their lives' and shared three photographs of herself at the hospital.

Flick underwent surgery to remove it from her bladder, ovarian fossa, uterosacral ligament (USL), bowel, left pelvic walls - as they were sticking together - and pararectal.

A uterine polyps - aka endometrial polyps - was also removed, which are usually benign growths from the lining of the uterus.

The surgery was a success with Flick uploading pictures of herself recovering at home - and being looked after by fiancé JJ Henry. 

'As I am wanting to have a family of my own one day it was so important for me to get this under control along with being able to hopefully eliminate the pain I have endured almost daily from it,' she said.

'I am not embarrassed anymore. I hope from my experience it can help everyone reading this.'

Flick is known for candidly discussing her troubles with depression and anxiety.

She admitted in August she would compare herself to others as a teenager and young adult for not being 'skinny enough' and 'unattractive'.

'I never felt good enough and I never felt pretty enough. I was constantly putting myself down and doing crazy stupid diets,' she revealed in an Instagram post on August 26.

'I was constantly putting myself down and doing crazy stupid diets. 

'I struggled with depression and anxiety quite horribly in my early twenties after losing my Grandma, but also at other stages throughout my life.

'I would be lying if I said I don’t still get anxiety as now it is something that I live with and have learnt to live with.'
