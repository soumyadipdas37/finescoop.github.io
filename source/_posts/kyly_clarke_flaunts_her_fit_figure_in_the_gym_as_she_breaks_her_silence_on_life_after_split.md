Kyly Clarke has shared her thoughts on life, following her split from Michael Clarke after seven years of marriage.  

On Tuesday, the stunning brunette, 39, shared a photograph of herself looking fit and fabulous in tight activewear while working out at the gym. 

Alongside the image, Kyle wrote: 'Never take life too seriously.... or should that be never take yourself too seriously.' 

'We all have our burdens to bare': On Tuesday, Kyly Clarke flaunted her sensational figure at the gym and shared her thoughts on life after her split from Michael Clarke 

The House Rules judge then spoke of the importance of having a sense of humour amid life's tough situations. 

'We all have our burdens to bare, we all suffer from some kind of stress that life bestows on us, but we truly are in this together,' she said. 

She then went on to encourage her 69,000 followers to be compassionate. 

'So be kind, gentle and soft with the next person you brush past, make them smile or laugh and see the affect it has on you,' she added. 

Philosophical: 'We all have our burdens to bare, we all suffer from some kind of stress that life bestows on us, but we truly are in this together,' she wrote in the caption

She continued: 'You never know what battle they are currently facing. And trust me, there is generally always something on someone's mind. Spread love and kindness.' 

Kyly's post comes after her ex-husband Michael Clarke reflected on his life, a year after separating from his wife. 

In a rare interview for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine, the retired Australian cricketer said that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'.

'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said. 

Michael, who co-parents four-year-old daughter Kelsey Lee with Kyly, went on to reveal that he has been able to maintain a 'wonderful' friendship with his ex-wife.

In July, Michael confirmed his relationship with P.E Nation co-founder Pip Edwards, when they were spotted enjoying a romantic vacation in Noosa, Queensland.

Hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip, 40, the radio host did say that he couldn't be happier.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said. 

Michael separated from Kyly in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.
