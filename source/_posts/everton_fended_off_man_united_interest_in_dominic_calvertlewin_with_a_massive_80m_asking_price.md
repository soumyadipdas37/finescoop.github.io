Everton reportedly told Manchester United they would need to pay £80million if they wanted to sign striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

The Sun claim Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had made the player a top target but hopes of a deal were ended abruptly when United heard the asking price.

Calvert-Lewin only cost Everton £1.5m when they signed him from Sheffield United four years ago.

He has since netted 36 goals in 136 appearances for the Toffees.

Three of those came in Saturday's 5-2 win over West Brom at Goodison Park. 

The hat-trick sees the 23-year-old leading the race for the Premier League Golden Boot, having also scored the only goal of the game in the opening day win over Tottenham.  

After the game, Calvert-Lewis said: 'The manager is on me every day about one-touch finishes and being in the box - being in the right areas to put the ball in the back of the net.

'It's nice to know what I'm working on in training is coming off on the pitch.

'That's the biggest reward - my first hat-trick in professional football and in the end a good team performance.'

At the time Ancelotti said: 'I think he is going to be at the top in England and in Europe.'
