She opened the third night of the Democratic National Convention last month, and is continuing to promote political activism on social media in a crucial election year hampered by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Kerry Washington appeared in a fabulous and playful selfie on her Instagram on Tuesday, swinging from a stripper pole on the occasion of National Poll Worker Recruitment Day.

It was a literal and rather tongue in cheek reference to 'working the pole,' to encourage people to assist with voting in the upcoming presidential election when the country is facing a record shortage of poll workers due to Covid.

Kerry, 43, was channeling Glow vibes in the sexy snap, in a maroon scoop-neck leotard with slate grey sports bra underneath.

Washington was perfectly coiffed with sleek hair in the image, hanging from the poll with one hand on her hip. 

The Confirmation actress smiled faintly and crossed her ankles in the pose, barefoot.  

'WORK THAT POLL!' she captioned the post, offering more information to those interested.

'How much voting swag is too much voting swag? Asking for a friend...' Kerry captioned the post cheekily.

On August 20th, Washington opened DNC Night 3 with a declaration that the 'fight is real.' 

'We are fighting for the soul of this country and for our lives,' she said. 'And right now that fight is real. A more equal, more just future.' 

The New York City native also took to her Insta-Story on Monday and shared a photo of the cast of The Prom that shows herself posing alongside the likes of director Ryan Murphy and co-stars Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Keegan-Michael Key and James Corden, among others.

Speaking up: The actress has been very vocal about the election and social change on her social media

Washington can be seen decked out in a cream-colored outfit with her hands crossed across her chest.

Filming was suspended in March when COVID-19 was deemed a pandemic, and eventually resumed shooting in late July.

The Prom tells the story of a troupe of 'self-obsessed' theater stars that arrive to a small town in Indiana to support a high school girl who wants to take her girlfriend to prom.

It is slated to premiere later this year, likely in time for the holiday season.
