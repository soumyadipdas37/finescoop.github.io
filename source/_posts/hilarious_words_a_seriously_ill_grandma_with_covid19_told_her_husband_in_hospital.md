An elderly woman with coronavirus told her husband not to 'be a baby' in some hilarious words of encouragement following his virus diagnosis.

Three generations of the Melbourne family were struck down with COVID-19 after grandmother Caterina, in her 80s, contracted the illness in July.

Her husband Dominic, who is also in his 80s, also tested positive, along with their daughter Franca and granddaughter Emma, 25.

Franca broke down while telling Sunrise about her parents' admission into the coronavirus ward at Austin Hospital.

'I was told by emergency doctors that, if they were to go to the intensive care unit...' she trailed off, to emotional to finish her sentence.

According to the Australian Department of Health, people over the age of 70 with underlying medical conditions, like Caterina and Dominic, carry a far greater risk of death than younger patients.

Caterina told the program she felt so ill in hospital one night that she reached out to a doctor and said: 'I can't handle anymore.'

'I started to cry because I was so sick, and the doctor came and gave me a big hug and said "don't cry, you'll be alright".'Â 

She remained ill in hospital while her husband was released, but was well enough to give him some firm words of encouragement.

'Don't be a baby, okay? Be strong. Because you're a bit of a sook.'

Caterina and Dominic shared a hospital room and were able to support each other through their sickness

Caterina stood by her choice of words on Sunrise.

'He's like that,' she laughed. 'When you're sick, you start to get a little bit down.'

The family thanked the staff at the hospital for working to save their lives, and encouraged others not to give up hope.

'There can be light at the end of the tunnel,' Franca said. 'Stay positive.'
