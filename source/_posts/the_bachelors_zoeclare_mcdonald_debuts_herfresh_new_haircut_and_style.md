The Bachelor's 'oppressed ranga' Zoe-Clare McDonald proudly showed off her fresh red locks on Wednesday after visiting her local hairdresser in Brisbane.

The 23-year-old debuted her new cut after getting her tresses trimmed and styled at Edwards And Co hairdressing salon.

Zoe-Clare also had a gloss treatment to enhance the colour and shine of her natural red hair.

After the haircut and treatment, her long red locks were styled in loose waves and fell effortlessly by her shoulders.

The reality TV star showed off her slim figure in a white crop top and light blue jeans for the outing.

The Bachelor star completed her ensemble with a pair of white sneakers and wore a neutral palette of makeup.

Zoe-Clare starred on this season of The Bachelor but was eliminated after failing to receive a rose from Locky Gilbert, last week. 

Shortly after her arrival on this year's season, she went on a lengthy rant about how redheads are regularly discriminated against after Areeba Emmanuel interrupted her discussion with Locky.

'To me, it's disrespectful. If she wants to act the child, that's fine,' she told producers.

She continued:'I'm the only redhead in the whole entire house... The only colours are blonde or brunette, and then there's me. I think that's exactly why Areeba is targeting me. It's the red hair. It's just...it's not appropriate.'

'Like, did Areeba do it to any of the blonde girls? Any of the brunette girls? No.' 

She continued: 'What's wrong with a ranga? I'm sorry, do you want me to dye my hair every 10 seconds because you don't like my colour? I'm so sorry, but this is natural, guys. It's not going anywhere.'
