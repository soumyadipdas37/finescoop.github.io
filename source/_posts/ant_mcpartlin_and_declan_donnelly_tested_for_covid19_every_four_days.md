With the return of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! fast approaching, the pair have resumed their typically busy schedules after lockdown restrictions eased. 

And Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly proved there's no rest for the wicked as they helped welcome Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield back to This Morning on Tuesday.

During a rare TV interview, the hosts, both 44, revealed they're tested for coronavirus every four days in order to present their much-loved shows together.

The pair kicked off their segment by hugging on air as they explained why they don't need to keep a social distance from each other. 

Removing their protective face masks, Dec shared: 'We don't need these with each other. We're in a cohort!', while Ant added: 'We're working on BGT and other things so we get tested every four or five days so.

'We form a cohort with our households. We have to be careful of where we go and who we see. Nothing new there!'

He later discussed fronting 2018's edition of I'm A Celebrity with former Celebrity Juice star Holly, who claimed her stint was 'magical'.

'We have to be careful': Removing their protective face masks, broadcaster Dec shared: 'We don't need these with each other. We're in a cohort!'

The media personality jokingly said: 'I said there was only one person who could do it. I didn't want another guy standing next to me and it had to be a girl. So it had to be holly and thankfully she said yes.'

Ant, who had checked himself into rehab and was fined £86,000 for a drink-driving offence before his year-long career break, added: 'I've never spoken to you [Holly] about it!'  

As they prepare to film the series at North Wales' Gwrych Castle instead of Australia due to the coronavirus pandemic, Holly and Phil were eager to get the TV veterans to tease any details.

When asked whether Tiger King's Carole Baskin will appear on this year's show, a coy Dec said: 'The rumours are there. We couldn't possibly say. 

'We will be in wales, we are very much looking forward to it and its going to be completely different so no one knows what it will be like.'

'It's great': The TV icons also discussed BGT's return to the small screen over the weekend and Ashley Banjo stepping in for Simon Cowell as he recovers from a back injury (pictured in April)

Ant said: 'We're back this Saturday so it's the semi-finals, Ashley Banjo stepped in he's really good. From the off his comments are very good, quite harsh sometimes. He has great insight because he's been on it.'

On how the show has adjusted to the new normal amid the COVID-19 crisis, Dec explained: 'There's no live audience but we have a huge virtual audience who are all on their sofa clapping and cheering along.

'It's different people and a different audience every week, it looks fantastic. It's tough on the acts, especially for them to come out and sing to nobody.'

'It's gone in the blink of an eye': They later touched on marking 30 years in showbusiness as they promoted their new book Once Upon A Tyne, set for release on Thursday

Ant shared insight into their new project by adding: 'We wanted it to be like a conversation and us talking through a story. Every chapter will be about a show we work on and the backstage stories of them.'

On their time in the spotlight, the Geordie stars said: 'It feels like it's gone in the blink of an eye. It bizarrely feels like we're only getting started. I don't think you ever feel like, 'oh I've made it.'

'There is an element that someone will knock on the door and say that well it was meant to be for someone else and we go, 'oh, okay.'

All laughs: Poking fun at competing for the Best Presenter prize at the annual National Television Awards, Phil, 58, joked: 'Well, that's the NTAs stuffed again!'

'We love working together': They also confessed they 'don't really remember' meeting each other for the first time as teenagers, but recall 'clicking' instantly (pictured on BBC in 2000)

'We love it, we're very lucky to be involved in three of the biggest shows on TV. We love working together, we love each other and being together and working together.' 

Poking fun at competing for the Best Presenter prize at the annual National Television Awards, Phil, 58, joked: 'Well, that's the NTAs stuffed again!' 



They confessed they 'don't really remember' meeting each other for the first time as teenagers, but recall 'clicking' instantly.

Broadcaster Ant said: 'For me it was so daunting because there were all these kids who knew each other and they were all quite cliquey and as a 13-year-old kid who is self-conscious. We clicked quite quickly once we started working together.

'There's no pressure for ratings': Before the pair started SMTV in the late 90s, Ant revealed Phil had advised them to 'enjoy it, because it’ll be the best time you’ll ever have on television'

'They became friends and we got to know each other, we had the same interests and same sense of humour.' 

Before the pair started SMTV in the late 90s, Ant revealed Phil had advised them to 'enjoy it, because it’ll be the best time you’ll ever have on television.'

The former Text Santa star continued: 'But you’re right. What it is, is there’s no pressure for ratings, for getting it right, but you could just have fun on a Saturday morning.

'We would try stuff out every Saturday and just mess about. If it didn’t work, you’d do something else next week.'

Rounding off the discussion, the ex-PJ & Duncan musicians detailed a funny story about their documentary with Prince Charles five years ago.

'I hope he didn't hear anything through the walls!' The ex-PJ & Duncan musicians also detailed a funny story about their documentary with Prince Charles in 2015 (pictured in March)

Ant said: 'It was in the place that he has in Scotland… and he said, ''Would you like to stay over because we’re doing an interview the next morning?'''

Dec explained: 'We go up the main staircase and our butler, who met us out of the car says, ''Ant - this is your room. Dec - this is your room. Prince Charles is there - next door.''' 

'He was opposite me. So I put my robe on and I nipped downstairs, at the time when I smoked. I’m going to nip downstairs for a smoke. So I get to the top of the stairs, in a robe, and he’s there', Ant continued.

'With a pair of secateurs and he says, ''I’ve just been out pruning the roses.'' I kind of have this small talk with him and back into the room, and then silently scream into the pillow. But yeah, it was wonderful. I just hope he didn’t hear anything through the walls!'

Presenters Ant and Dec last appeared on This Morning to celebrate Holly and Phillip's 10-year anniversary in September 2019.

The blonde beauty and her TV husband have been on a break from their much-loved stints since early July, with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford filling in their roles. 

The award-winning show is said to have smashed new records for the first time in a decade. 

This Morning, which has been airing throughout the coronavirus pandemic, has reportedly seen rating records rise to 1.2 million.  

And amid the new records, This Morning presenter Alison Hammond has landed her own travel segment with co-star Josie Gibson, which will be inspired by the classic film 'Thelma and Louise'.

The two former Big Brother stars, aged 45 and 35, will compete against each other to find the best places to staycation in the UK.

Alison told the Mirror: 'Josie - it's on! Who doesn't love a good old fashioned game of Top Trumps and even better, This Morning has given it a crazy new twist by incorporating some of Britain's most unusual staycation spots.' 

While Josie joked to the publication: 'Alison & Josie - some may have coined us the better looking version of Ant & Dec (okay that someone might have been me!).'

A source added: 'Josie's always wanted to work on This Morning and when she originally got the job she asked if she could be the 'Judith Chalmers of the UK'. So with this new strand she's now got her dream job, with her dream woman in Alison.'
