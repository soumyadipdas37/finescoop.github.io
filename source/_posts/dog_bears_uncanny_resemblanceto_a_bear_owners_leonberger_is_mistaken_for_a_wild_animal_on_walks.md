The owner of a huge dog in Norway claims people mistake her pet for a bear while she's out walking it.

Gentle giant Runny, a one-year-old Leonberger, often stops shocked passersby in their tracks when she's on a stroll with owner Marit Lillejordet in the forests of Oslo.

Despite the 50kg canine's seemingly intimidating size, Marit insists Runny is in fact a total sweetheart who loves to meet other dogs and humans.

She does emulate a bear's characteristics, such as enjoying long walks in the forests and taking a cooling dip in the lakes.

She is not yet her full size and is expected to weigh around 55 to 60kgs when she's fully grown.

Marit, 57, a mental health therapist, said: 'She is kind to everyone she meets, both humans and other dogs. She loves to play with other dogs - big and small. She is really a gentle giant.'
