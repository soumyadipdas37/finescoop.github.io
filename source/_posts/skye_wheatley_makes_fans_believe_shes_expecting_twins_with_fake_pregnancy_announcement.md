Skye Wheatley sent her Instagram fans into meltdown on Sunday after uploading what appeared to be a pregnancy announcement.  

The former Big Brother star, 26, had uploaded a sweet family photo of herself, boyfriend Lachlan Waugh and their one-year-old son Forest - but it was her misleading caption that landed the Instagram model in hot water.  

'And then there were five,' the mother-of-one began her caption, seemingly implying she and Lachlan are expecting twins.

'And don't ask what's going on with my shorts, promise I didn't grow a penni,' she continued, referring to the creased fabric of her denim shorts. 

Making the so-called pregnancy post even more compelling was the fact that Lachlan's hand was seen resting on Skye's belly. 

However, upon closer inspection it seems the phrase 'and then there were five' actually a reference to her pet dachshunds Winston and Crunchie, who were seen playing in the background.   

Say what? 'And then there were five,' the mother-of-one began her caption, seemingly implying she and Lachlan are expecting twins

Having grabbed fans' attention, Skye finished her caption by promoting her new business Presets By Skye & Freja, which sells pre-made image filters.  

Skye's followers were understandably confused by the post, with one commenting: 'Omg I thought this was a pregnancy announcement'. 

'I thought you meant you were pregnant with twins god damn,' another frustrated follower concurred.

'I thought you meant you were pregnant!' Skye's followers were understandably confused by the post

The surgically-enhanced reality star eventually responded to the cacophony of comments, confirming that she isn't pregnant and that her next baby announcement will be 'far more epic than a mirror selfie'. 

Skye has previously spoken about her desire to welcome a second child.  



'How are you so perfect two days old? Wonder what our next one will look like?' she wrote next to a photo of newborn Forest. 

Then, just a few weeks later, the new mother posted to Instagram: 'This is my life now... And I still want another one, god I'm bat s*** crazy haha.'  

Well that clears things up! Skye eventually confirmed that she isn't pregnant and that her next baby announcement will be 'far more epic than a mirror selfie' 

Clucky!  Skye has previously spoken about her desire to welcome a second child after welcoming baby Forest on Christmas Eve, 2018
