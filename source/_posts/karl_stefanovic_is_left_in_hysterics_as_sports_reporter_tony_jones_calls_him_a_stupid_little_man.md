He's been back co-hosting the Today show since January and has had plenty of laughs in that time.  

And on Wednesday, Karl Stefanovic was left in hysterics during a segment with sports reporter, Tony Jones, 58. 

Karl 46, teased Tony about the AFL Grand Final moving from Melbourne to Brisbane, when Tony took a playful jab at Karl and called him a 'stupid little man' while live on air.

Karl first ribbed Tony, who hails from Melbourne, about the AFL snub by playing Baby Can I Hold You by Tracy Chapman. 

'The COVID blows keep coming for Victoria,' Karl began. 

'This song is just for you my man, close your eyes!'

After part of the song played, Tony hilariously called Karl a 'stupid little man.'

'You stupid little man, if you honestly think I'm going to come on and be all grumpy and morose, you're wrong Karl, you're wrong!' Tony said.

He added: 'I'm thrilled to the back teeth Brisbane has stolen the biggest sporting event in Australia, I couldn't be happier... I know the AFL-loving fans in Queensland will get behind it.'

'They'll embrace everything that is special with the AFL... it's not like we have nothing to do. It's bin night tonight,' Tony added, making Karl laugh even harder.  

'I liked it!' Karl then joked about being called a 'stupid little man,' saying he's never been called that before

'I've never been called that before, but I liked it,' he said, before joking that he's been 'called worse' over the years.  

Tony is a Melbourne-based sports reporter for the Today show, who made headlines in 2016 for trying to give WAG Rebecca Judd a kiss on the cheek.

The incident with Rebecca occurred on Nine News Melbourne in August 2016, when Tony attempted to give the AFL WAG a peck on the cheek before she went on maternity leave.

'Good luck, Bec!' he said, before leaning in. At that moment, the WAG instinctively pulled away and yelped, before bursting into fits of giggles.

Realising he had just been rejected on camera, Tony crossed his arms and grumbled, 'OK, good, this is going well,' as his face turned red.

Awkward! The WAG instinctively pulled away and yelped, before bursting into fits of giggles. Tony was rejected on camera
