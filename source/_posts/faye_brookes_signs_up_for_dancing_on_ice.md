Faye Brookes has reportedly become the latest celebrity to sign up for the next series of Dancing On Ice.

According to The Sun, the former Coronation Street star, 33, will be making her TV return since quitting her role as Kate Connor on the soap last year. 

A source said: 'Faye will bring the glamour to the ice and DOI bosses are over the moon she’s chosen to put her skates on this year.

'With her top class acting skills she’s sure to impress the judges in the performance stakes.'

The series will not be Faye's first brush with reality TV as she was previously said to be lined up for I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2018.

However, the actress pulled out of the show before it started as she was reportedly too upset over her split from Gareth Gates to take part.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Faye and ITV for comment.

Last year, Faye went public with her romance with boyfriend Joe Davies, after her split from ex-fiancé Gareth.

She confirmed her new romance with the personal trainer in late November as they made their red carpet debut at the White Christmas musical press night.

During the night, the actress leaned into Joe as he placed a hand on the small of her back, indicating the friends had grown closer since Faye's relationship with Gareth ended in July of that year.

Gareth, 36, is said to have found love with Ibiza DJ Chloe McLennan following his split from Faye.

Gareth celebrated his birthday in July with a group of family and friends, as well as with Chloe.

Posting a snap to Instagram, he added the caption: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.'

He didn't tag Chloe in the post but she was present with his nearest and dearest.

A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April. They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since.'

Indeed, comments have materialised online under social media snaps, with Gareth writing 'Mmmmm' under one of Chloe's sultry snaps.

Faye and Gareth first met when they featured in the Legally Blonde: The Musical, and went public with their relationship in August 2013.

In September 2018, it was reported that Faye and Gareth briefly ended their relationship when the singer's 'very controlling' behaviour led to a series of furious rows.
