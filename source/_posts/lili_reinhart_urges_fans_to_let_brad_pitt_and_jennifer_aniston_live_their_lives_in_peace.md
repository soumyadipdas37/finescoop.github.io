Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston reunited onscreen for the first time in decades on Thursday with a risqué table read of the 1982 film Fast Times At Ridgemont High.

While the former power couple, who divorced in 2005, sent most of the internet buzzing over their scripted flirting, Lili Reinhart expressed her distain over the public's response. 

'Unpopular opinion: can we just leave Jennifer and Brad alone?' the 24-year-old CW star tweeted on Friday. 'Stop analyzing their every move and facial expression whenever they’re involved in something together.'

She concluded: 'Let them live their lives in peace.'  

The actress' sensitivity most likely stems from having her own relationship with her ex and current co-star, Cole Sprouse, who parted ways in March, heavily dissected. 

Earlier this month, the actress admitted to feeling 'like a prisoner' for having to return to filming Riverdale's fourth season, amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Unlike Reinhart, who has to fulfill her Riverdale shooting obligations in person, Pitt and Aniston were able to reunite virtually to raise money for a coronavirus charity.  

During their performance Brad, 56, took on the role of Brad Hamilton, originally played by Judge Reinhold, 63, while his ex-wife, 51, played high school 'sex queen' Linda Barrett, portrayed by Phoebe Cates, 57, in the coming-of-age teenage dramedy. 

The former couple shared a screen together during the film's daydream sequence which takes place after Brad arrives at a pool party hosted by his younger sister Stacy Hamilton, played by Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts, 52.

Jennifer wore a red bikini top over a white tank top for the scene during the live virtual table read and Brad brought a pirate hat for his character's fast-food restaurant employee costume. 

The duo had to recreate one of the film's most risque scenes, where Jennifer's character Linda walks in on Brad's character 'daydreaming' about her topless in the bathroom as she looks for Q-tips.   

Previously, the Oscar winner famously made a guest appearance on Jennifer's hit TV sitcom Friends in 2001, a year into their marriage.

Jennifer and Brad got married in Malibu, California, in July 2000 and announced their separation fives years later.

He then famously confirmed his romance with now ex-wife Angelina Jolie in 2006 after meeting on the set of film Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2005. 

Since their high-profile split, Jennifer married American actor Justin Theroux in 2015 but the two split in 2017.
