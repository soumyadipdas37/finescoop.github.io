Ulrika Jonsson has explained why she swapped 'uncomfortable' thongs for 'apple catcher’ underwear in a new interview.

The former model, 53, revealed she was influenced to wear knickers, which she has described as 'the bane of my life', during her mid-20s due to 'societal pressure', and would revert to sporting full briefs during her pregnancies.

Crediting her preferred form of lingerie for helping her feel confident in her skin, the presenter said: 'To be fair, I haven’t really looked back since I allowed the big-girl pants to re-embrace my bottom.'

The media personality shared how she's struggled with thongs since her younger years as she spent a lot of her time correcting spillage, which caused her to feel 'unique' and 'weird'.

'They’ve been nothing but the proverbial pain in the a**e. Having to veil my vagina and shroud my undercarriage is almost some kind of mild, modern oppression', the host told The Sun. 'Oh, I’ll never forget trying on my first G-string. Not quite as traumatic as childbirth but definitely up there.'

The broadcaster went on to recall moments when she left 'changing rooms in floods of tears' after failing to find swimwear which accentuated her curves.

'It was disastrous': The broadcaster went on to recall moments when she left 'changing rooms in floods of tears' after failing to find swimwear which accentuated her curves 

She shared: 'I invariably ended up with an awkward-fitting bikini bottom which never fully embraced my nether assets but also a disastrous, unsupportive bikini top which allowed my boobs to spread, escape and go on their own separate holiday.' 

The blonde insisted she saw 'apple catchers' as her 'only solution', and has managed to feel comfortable ever since leaving sexy underwear behind. 

Ulrika first revealed her switch earlier this week, when she displayed her enviable frame in black boy shorts for a bedroom snap uploaded on Instagram.

Her blonde tresses were styled in loose waves as she also showcased her bronzed legs. 

 She captioned the snap: 'Time to put my big girls’ pants on. Always preferred big Apple Catchers to Dental Floss anyway. I’m a comfort girl. Looks grim outside but got to crack on.

'Right now, I’d love someone to bring me a cuppa in bed but that ain’t happening. Gonna get my a**e in gear and soldier on.'
