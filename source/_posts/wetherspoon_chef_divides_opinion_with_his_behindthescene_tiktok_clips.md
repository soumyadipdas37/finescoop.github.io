A Wetherspoon chef has divided opinion with his behind-the-scene TikTok clips - which show him preparing a ready-made korma in the microwave, but also making a Full English breakfast from scratch.

Chef J Salsa, who shares content under the handle @_jahkt, upset fans of the pub chain after revealing that its curry was pre-made and simply warmed up before being served.

'You’re ruining Spoons for everyone,' one viewer told the worker, after he joked he 'didn't get paid enough' to reheat a plastic packet of rice and cook a naan bread on the grill.

However, others were impressed to discover that several elements of the firm's Full English breakfast were made from fresh ingredients and cooked on-site.

Chef J Salsa, who shares content under the handle @_jahkt on TikTok, upset fans of the pub chain after revealing that its curry was pre-made (pictured) and simply warmed up before being served

However, others were impressed to discover that several elements of the firm's Full English breakfast were made from fresh ingredients and cooked on-site after the chef (pictured) showed how he would make the dish while at work

In his video showing how a korma was made, the chef explained: 'First up, warm up your defrosted chicken curry in the microwave for about two or three minutes along with your rice for another two minutes.

'Then I prepared these poppadoms earlier so just slap it on the plate. When your rice is ready slap it on the plate. I don’t get paid enough for this. 

'Put your curry into the special traditional curry bowl, imported straight from India, custom made just for Spoons. Then put your bread onto the plate.'

His clip has received more than one million views on TikTok - with some customers shocked that the entire meal is pre-made. 

One user commented: 'You mean to tell me that I pay £7.50 for a microwave meal,' while another said: 'Microwaved but still bangs.'

However, other viewers were very impressed when J Salsa showed how a classic Full English breakfast is created at the chain - with most the ingredients being cooked from fresh (pictured)

A third added: 'I work in Spoons and this is true. How are you surprised? You get what you pay for it's not Michelin star food.'

The chef starts by grilling two slices of bacon and frying an egg before deep frying some hash browns and putting a slice of bread on the grill. 

He then adds pre-cooked grilled tomatoes, two sausages, and a spoonful of baked beans to the plate before serving it up.  

'Wait they don't actually microwave everything?" one asked, while another viewer added: 'I genuinely thought Spoons kitchens only had microwaves in.'

A third wrote: 'Why did I grow up thinking all food from Spoons was microwaved?', while another said: 'Wow it isn't actually just microwave food I am shook.'
