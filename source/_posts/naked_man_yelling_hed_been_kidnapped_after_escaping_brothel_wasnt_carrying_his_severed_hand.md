Police say a naked man who claimed he had been kidnapped after smashing his way out of a suspected brothel's window wasn't carrying his severed hand.

Two people have been arrested following a bizarre incident in Grimsby on Saturday, which saw the naked figure walking down a residential street and seeking refuge in a shop after yelling 'someone help me, I've been kidnapped'. 

It was understood the man had his hand badly wounded before or after smashing through the front window of a house in Convamore Road, Grimsby, to escape his abductors on Saturday afternoon.

A picture from the scene showed the man carrying what looked to be his own severed hand moments after the incident.

Last night Humberside Police confirmed this was not the case. 

A naked man was seen carrying what was originally thought to be a severed hand after he broke through a window and escaped from a home where he was being held captive by abductors

Detective Inspector Rhod Troake said: 'Following an incident yesterday on Convamore Road in Grimsby, a man was taken to hospital where he was treated for injuries and has since been released.

'We are aware of speculation that the man was carrying a body part, however this is not the case.

'Several lines of enquiry are ongoing to determine the exact circumstances that led to the man's injuries.

'Two people have been arrested in connection with the incident and remain in our custody.

'I want to reassure the community that we believe this to be an isolated incident with no further threat to the public.' 

The incident triggered a major response by police and the ambulance service to the scene in East Marsh.

Police have confirmed the unidentified man was not carrying his own severed hand, after smashing through the front window of a house in Convamore Road, Grimsby,  on Saturday 

The injured man sought refuge in a shop across the road after the incident late on Saturday afternoon. Paramedics treated him at the scene before he was taken to hospital.

An eyewitness said: 'I was sat at home about 4pm and heard a massive crash.

'I looked out and saw an oldish white bloke had gone crashing through the big window and there was glass all over the front garden.

'The man was completely naked, he had long scruffy hair and blood was gushing from his right arm.

'He was shouting ''someone help me I have been kidnapped''.

'He then ran to the shop and asked for help. Apparently the shopkeeper, who has closed today because of what happened, said he was calm and waited until police came.

'He used the doormat to cover up his bits and pieces.' 

It is believed he was being held against his will at the house after being forced to leave another address in Cleethorpes earlier on Saturday.

The image, caught by a shocked passer-by, shows the man naked near the Lifestyle Express corner shop on the corner of Convamore Road and Ropery Street.

His left lower arm is hidden by his body but in his right hand he appears to be carrying something, which is also shown in the shadow cast on the ground.

There are reports he had been beaten in the house, before he managed to escape by throwing himself through the window.

A terraced house across the road from the shop had its ground floor window almost completely smashed out. It was sealed off by police after the incident.

A heavy police presence was in the area following the incident on Saturday afternoon.

Witnesses reported smashed glass from the ground floor window of the house and medical staff at the scene. Medical equipment used to treat the man was lying outside the Lifestyle Express shop.

One said: 'Apparently the man jumped out of the window without any clothes on and ran across the road to a shop.

'It looks like he was treated by paramedics in the shop.'

Medical equipment used to treat the man was lying outside the Lifestyle Express shop that the man sought refuge in 

Several police cars and vans descended on the area with officers setting up a large scene of crime area.

Convamore Road was cordoned off from Sixhills Street to Ropery Street, with motorists being turned around.

Detectives were seen conducting door to door enquiries as they waited for Crime Scene Investigators to arrive.
