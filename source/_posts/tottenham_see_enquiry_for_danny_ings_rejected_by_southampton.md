Southampton have issued a hands-off warning after Tottenham made an enquiry for Danny Ings.

Spurs are on the verge of confirming Gareth Bale's stunning return to the club and the £27.5million capture of left back Sergio Reguilon, both from Real Madrid.

And they remain in the market for a striker to support talisman Harry Kane with Southampton star Ings featuring high on manager Jose Mourinho's long list of potential targets.

Southampton have issued a hands-off warning to Tottenham over star striker Danny Ings

Tottenham made an enquiry to Southampton on Wednesday but that has been firmly rejected

Spurs made contact with Southampton on Wednesday to firm up their interest however Southampton made it clear have no interest in selling their star striker.

Ings scored 25 times last season, including 22 in the Premier League to fall just one short of a share of the Premier League Golden Boot.

His form has earned him a recall to the England squad after a five-year absence too.

And rather than entertain selling the 28-year-old Southampton are hoping to tie Ings down on a new contract, as revealed by Sportsmail last month.

Ings' current £65,000-per-week deal expires in 2022.

When asked about Spurs's interest in Ings following Southampton's 2-0 Carabao Cup defeat against Brentford on Wednesday night, manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: 'I do not want to comment on any rumours, no.'
