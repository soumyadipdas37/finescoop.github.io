One of the most highly-anticipated movies of the year, a new adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, released a new teaser ahead of the first full trailer tomorrow.

While the brief 45-second trailer doesn't reveal any footage, it does offer a brief look at some of the main characters.

The characters featured include Josh Brolin's  Gurney Halleck, Zendaya's Chani, Javier Bardem's Stiglar, Timothee Chalamet's  Paul Atreides, Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atreides, Jason Momoa's Duncan Idaho and Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica.

The teaser merely scrolls through these faces, with Zendaya's Chani the only one to blink or show any facial movement.

While the characters scroll by, Chalamet's Paul Atreides is heard stating the Litany of Fear from the iconic Frank Herbert novel, which reads as follows.

'Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me. Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain.'

The final shot features Paul Atreides on his own in the middle of the desert, giving fans a tiny taste of the full trailer on Wednesday.

The teaser trailer also debuted attached to prints of Warner Bros. Tenet, which opened to lukewarm results at the box office over the Labor Day holiday weekend.

Fans got their first glimpse of these characters last month, when Empire unveiled the first-look photos of several of the main characters.

Dune was written by Frank Herbert in 1965 and was named in 2003 as the best-selling science-fiction novel of all time, which follows Paul Atreides, the son of a noble family entrusted with protecting the most valuable element in the galaxy.

It was previously adapted into the 1984 feature film of the same name by writer-director David Lynch, starring Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides.

There was also a 2000 mini-series adaptation that starred William Hurt.
