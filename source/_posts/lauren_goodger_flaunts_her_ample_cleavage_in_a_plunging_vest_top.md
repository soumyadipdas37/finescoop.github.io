She faced backlash for posting pictures with ex-fiancé Mark Wright for TOWIE's 10th anniversary earlier this week. 

And Lauren Goodger turned the heads as she was seen for the first time since the episode aired as she headed out in Essex on Monday. 

The former TOWIE star, 33, showed off her ample cleavage in a plunging pink vest which she teamed with grey jogging bottoms as she walked through a park.

Lauren co-ordinated her loungewear outfit with a pink heart face mask and grey trainers. 

She tied her brunette hair back in a low ponytail and amped up the glamour with a full-face of make-up. 

Lauren's outing comes after she uploaded a slew of snaps with ex Mark, 33, to mark 10 years of TOWIE.

Lauren took to Instagram to thank the famous show for providing her with meaningful 'memories' and insisted she's 'proud' of all her castmates. 

Childhood sweethearts Lauren and Mark became engaged on TOWIE, after both starring since its inauguration in 2010, and were a couple for 11 years before suffering an extremely acrimonious break-up which has led to much mud-slinging. 

Despite their bitter split, the Celebs Go Dating star brushed aside their past drama to upload images of them winning the Audience Award at the 2011 BAFTA Awards.

The media personality wrote in an accompanying caption: '10 years ago changed my life we created a show called 'the only way is Essex' I was 22 when I first started filming and what an amazing journey this has been !!

'I put my life on national television and we won a BAFTA - not a lot people can say that ! You've seen me laugh, cry, engaged, break ups and make ups ! I've grown up on the screens and it was all real!  

'Congratulations to all the OGs @towie these images are from google thank you for memories and well to all my costars im proud of you all and always will be.' (sic)

Mark and Lauren were believed to be on bad terms ever since they called it quits, and the former Extra host went on to tie the knot to actress Michelle Keegan in May 2015.

Some, however, called it 'inappropriate' to show photos with Mark seeing as he is now happily-married to Michelle.
