As a loving husband and father-of-two headed off for a morning surf, Simon Wilson had no idea he was set to become a dad again.  He would never find out.

The last time Simon was seen was when he was pulled out of the water off Mermaid Beach on the Gold Coast.

Amid her grief at her husband's still-unexplained death on August 6, his wife Lisa took a home pregnancy test the next day.

'I had suspected I was pregnant but didn't want to take the test too soon. But after what happened, I just had to know,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

The test was positive, and so were two more she took just to be sure. A visit to the doctor four days later confirmed the bittersweet news.  

Mr Wilson, 44, was already a devoted father to Ava, 8, and Finn, 4, whom his wife promised will make sure he's not forgotten.

'My kids will definitely keep that memory alive for their new sibling. They will know who their dad was and how much he loved all us,' she said.

'Simon was kind, generous and always willing to help out. He was a wonderful friend and work colleague. He was one of those people that everyone liked. 

'He always took time out to teach the kids things and just play with them. Whatever they wanted to do. 

'He used to like treating them with little dates individually or together. He worked hard to provide for us and wanted to give us nice things and take us on adventures.'

'My kids will definitely keep that memory alive for their new sibling. They will know who their dad was and how much he loved all us,' Lisa said

Finn barely knew his father, just for four short years, before he was suddenly ripped from their lives

Lisa said she was devastated by the very thought of Mr Wilson not being at the birth of his child in April 2021.

'He loved our kids so, so much, he would have been excited at hearing the news just as he was with our first two,' she said.

Also agonising was not knowing how and why he died, even after a post-mortem examination, blood tests, and a CT scan.

'I refuse to believe he just drowned due to the conditions, his knowledge of the water and the fact that he never panicked,' she said.

'My daughter keeps asking if we know yet how he died. That's hard to hear when we can't give her any answers.'

Queensland Ambulance at the time said it was believed Mr Wilson had a medical episode while on the surf, but what it was is unknown.

Lisa said she felt barely present in the world since that day and the family couldn't bring themselves to live in their half-renovated house.

The 44-year-old was pulled ashore by lifeguards and received 15 minutes of CPR but was unable to be saved (pictured paramedics and lifeguards at the scene on August 6)

The financial impact was also massive, with Lisa left with three children, a huge mortgage, and renovations still to pay for - and the breadwinner gone.

'The thought of having to do my job and his is overwhelming. He did a lot, I don't think I realised how much until he was gone,' she said. 

On that front at least, strangers have come to the rescue after close family friend Kate McFall started a fundraiser that has $42,000 in donations.

'Our own hearts break for these two – soon to be three - beautiful children, and Lisa who is now on her own to raise her babies without her soulmate,' she wrote.
