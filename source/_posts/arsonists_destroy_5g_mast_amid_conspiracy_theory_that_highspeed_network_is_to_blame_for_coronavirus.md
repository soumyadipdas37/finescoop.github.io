A 5G mast in West Yorkshire was set on fire in the early hours of this morning as conspiracy theorists claim that the high-speed network is linked to the Covid outbreak.

Police and fire services were called to reports of a burning mast on Otley Road in Bradford at around 3.39am on Thursday.  

Firefighters fought hard to extinguish the flames which had engulfed the phone mast.

The mast was destroyed in the fire, which left it burnt and melted near the top, and the structure was toppled using a crane at around 1pm today. 

The mast was cut into sections before being removed. 

Police are appealing for witnesses and are investigating the incident as a suspected arson attack. 

The fire comes following a series of suspected arson attacks on 5G masts across the country.

The incidents are believed to be motivated by conspiracy theories linking the coronavirus pandemic to the deployment of the new high-speed mobile phone network.

At least 90 phone masts in the UK have been damaged or burnt in attacks linked to the claims during lockdown.

Conspiracy theorists claim that the high-speed network is behind the Covid outbreak which has led to some communication masts being vandalised.

The theorists have claimed that the network could damage public health by emitting dangerous levels of radiation.  

Experts have repeatedly dismissed links to 5G and the coronavirus as false.   

The government recently published a guide on 5G masts in a bid to squash the 'quack' theories that the new technology could harm people's health. 

The information pamphlet, 5G Mobile Technology: A Guide, was issued in a bid to dispel misleading theories circulating on social media.
