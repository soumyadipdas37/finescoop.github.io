A grandmother believed to be one of the UK's longest Covid-19 patients has finally left hospital - after battling the virus for a staggering 135 days.

Determined Paula McCarten was seen leaving the Bradford hospital on Wednesday in an emotionally charged video after she spent nearly five months fighting off the killer virus.

The prison nurse spent over 100 days in ICU before she was finally able to be discharged - and is thought to be one of the UK's longest Covid-19 patients.

The longest anyone in the UK has been hospital with Covid-19 is believed to be 141 days.

The prison nurse was accompanied by her family as she thanked the 'wonderful' staff at Bradford Teaching Hospital who nursed her back to health after defying the odds

The 57-year-old was accompanied by her family as hospital staff at Bradford Teaching Hospital who saved her life applauded her following her remarkable recovery.

Doctors, nurses, and carers are seen forming a guard of honour in the heartwarming video as Paula was wheeled out of the hospital yesterday (Weds).

Paula thanked the 'wonderful' staff who nursed her back to health after defying the odds.

Paula, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, said: 'The doctors, carers and nurses been absolutely wonderful. I'm so glad to be with my three sons, my husband supporting me and all my family.

'I'm so proud so proud to be able to say this message.' 

The Ward 6 stroke unit, where she received rehabilitation, said she'd had a 'phenomenal battle'.

Professor Mel Pickup, Chief Executive of the Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, added: 'The best of happy endings to a story that lasted 135 days. 

'Delighted to see you reunited with your family and on your way home.' 

Last month, Fatima Bridle, who spent 141 days in hospital battling Covid-19, pneumonia and sepsis, was finally able to go home.

The 35-year-old fell ill with coronavirus after returning to the UK from a month-long trip to Mohammedia, Morocco.

Mrs Bridle, a former lab technician, spent nearly the whole of the UK lockdown in Southampton General Hospital fighting the virus.
