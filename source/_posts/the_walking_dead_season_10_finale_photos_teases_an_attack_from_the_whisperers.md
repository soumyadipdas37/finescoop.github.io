The Whisperers attack and Daryl (Norman Reedus) is spotted amid a zombie horde in a slew of new photos for The Walking Dead Season 10 finale.

The 16th episode of the hit zombie show's 10th season was originally slated to debut in April, though post-production delays due to COVID-19 pushed the finale back.

Showrunner Angela Kang announced at Comic-Con in July that the finale, entitled A Certain Doom, will air on October 4, with six additional Season 10 episodes arriving in 2021.

While the photos don't reveal too much in terms of plot details, one of the most intriguing snaps features Daryl making his way through a zombie horde, with a huge knife in each hand.

He's seemingly being lead through the horde by one of the Whisperers, wearing a zombie mask, who is holding Daryl's hoodie. 

There are other photos that hint at a group of Whisperers attacking Father Gabriel Stokes (Seth Gilliam), who is brandishing a shotgun.
