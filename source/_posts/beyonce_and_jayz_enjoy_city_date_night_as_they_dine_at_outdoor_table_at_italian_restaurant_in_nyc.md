In addition to drinking some wine, the group enjoyed a long dinner on the patio dining area.

Earlier this month, the Black Is King artist celebrated her 39th birthday during a vacation with her husband and their three children on board a luxury yacht in Europe.

The family was seen cruising around the coast of Cavtat, Croatia, on the new Benetti-built superyacht LANA, which costs an eye-watering $2 million a week to rent.

Beyonce and Jay-Z, who married in 2008, are parents to Blue Ivy, eight, and three-year-old twins Rumi and Suri.
