A Queensland man was stunned when he discovered the aftermath of an illegal all-night bush rave while driving off-road near Cairns.

Brody Roberts was taking his Jeep down a remote logging track in the Mona Mona area when he stumbled across hundreds of revellers packing the secluded area. 

'Holy ****!' Roberts said as he tried to navigate around vans, cars and 'half-naked hippies'. 

Vehicles and people flanked the road for hundreds of metres as Roberts and his companions speculated a bush party was probably on the night before.

'It was disgusting. There was rubbish and toilet paper and people sleeping and cars everywhere,' he told the Cairns Post.

He said his group would have passed at least 100 people and it was only 8am. 

The 4WD enthusiast said the lack of respect shown for the Kuranda National Park was shocking. 

'Every track we drove down there was cars everywhere and bottles of beer and food packets,' he said.

'This is what gets places locked down and us not being able to go there. We were not impressed with that.'

Police were called to the scene and dispersed about 300 people before seizing PA gear, no arrests were made. 

Outdoor event promoter Jacob McMillan told Daily Mail Australia he was disappointed to see illegal 'bush doofs' going ahead. 

'It's hard to be really critical of these illegal events, as I appreciate that our culture stemmed from the underground,' he said.

'But during COVID times the recent media presence is really damaging for legitimate event promoters that have been working hard over the years to gain council and community acceptance.'
