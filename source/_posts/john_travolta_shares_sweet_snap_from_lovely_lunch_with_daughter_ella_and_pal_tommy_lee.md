John Travolta shared a heartwarming snap on Saturday as he celebrated Tommy Lee's wife's birthday in Malibu alongside his daughter Ella.

The 66-year-old actor has been grieving his late wife Kelly Preston, who passed away in July aged 57 following a secret two year battle with breast cancer.

In his latest Instagram post, the Grease actor could be seen sitting beside his 20-year-old daughter while clad in a black T-shirt at Malibu eatery Nobu.

The Hollywood star was joined at the lunch in honour of Brittany Furlan Lee's 34th birthday by pal Tommy, Tommy's eldest son Brandon, 24, and Brittany's friends; Mikaela Hoover, 36, and model Daniella Beckerman.

Captioning the sun-soaked shot, he wrote: 'Lovely lunch today with the Lee's. Happy birthday @brittanyfurlan!' 

His latest post comes two weeks after he first broke his social media silence with a video of him and Ella dancing in honor of Kelly. 

In the emotional Instagram video, the father and daughter could be seen twirling across the dance floor in an otherwise almost completely empty venue.

John could be seen twirling his daughter to the soft strains of jazz music, seemingly played by a trio of piano, bass and drums.

'My daughter @ella.travolta and I dancing in memory of momma. One of Kelly’s favorite things to do with me,' John wrote in his caption. 

 Kelly and John were married from 1991 until she died tragically aged 57 of cancer last month at the family home in Florida.

Along with Ella, John and Kelly also shared two sons, including their youngest child Benjamin, nine.

The family was struck by tragedy in 2009 when their eldest son Jett struck his head in the bath, suffered a seizure and died at only 16.

It was announced in July that Kelly died from breast cancer after a secret two-year battle with the disease.

She was pronounced dead at 11:46am on July 12 at the family home in Clearwater, Florida, Us Weekly reported last month citing official documents. 

John, who played husband and wife with Kelly in the 2018 mafia biopic Gotti, announced her death on Instagram.

RIP: She was pronounced dead at 11:46am on July 12 at the family home in Clearwater, Florida 

He penned at the time: 'It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer. She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many. 

'Kelly’s love and life will always be remembered, I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don’t hear from us for a while,' the Grease icon continued. 

'But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.'
