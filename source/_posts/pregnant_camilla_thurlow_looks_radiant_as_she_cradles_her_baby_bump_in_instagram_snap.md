She's excitedly preparing for the arrival of her first child, after announcing she's expecting a bay with fellow former Love Island star Jamie Jewitt.

And Camilla Thurlow treated her fans to something of a progress report on Monday, when she took to Instagram to share a snap of herself cradling her baby bump.

The 33-year-old reality star looked positively radiant as she posed in a flowing patterned dress, which featured a deeply plunging neckline.

With her glossy brown locks styled in a sleek blowout, the mother-to-be further glammed up her look with gold earrings and a light slick of dewy makeup.

She shared the snap as part of a sponsored post for a florist − and couldn't resist making a quip about the 30th week of her pregnancy, stating she was 'in full bloom'.

Camilla's post comes after she admitted there have been 'ups and downs' with her pregnancy, but that she's 'very happy' while talking to Andi Peters on Lorraine.

The star also discussed struggling to open up to people after working as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in Afghanistan and Cambodia.

She said: 'The biggest part of it is about the work I did with the [charity] Halo Trust. 

'Before Love Island that was the work I liked doing and I was lucky enough to travel to Afghanistan and Cambodia, and during that time I learned a huge amount. 

'As I travelled across several different countries, it changed in different places, but the work was majority in landmine clearance.

'There's been ups and downs': Camilla Thurlow discussed her pregnancy on Lorraine on Thursday and admitted to feeling 'social dislocation' after working as a bomb disposal expert

'You might clear land that can then be used for people to farm land for food for their family. Every country had different challenges, but it was an amazing experience.'

Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World 

The memoir is not just about finding the courage to go out and deal with lethal threats at work, but the courage to confront one's own fears and anxieties.

She said: 'I feel like I had got to a point where I had enough space to reflect on those times with Halo that were perhaps trickier and have the opportunity to turn that into something I could explain to others.

'I've always wanted to write a book and the last few years have been about working out how to do that.

'I came back from Afghanistan and I struggled with social dislocation, and was struggling to process the events I'd seen.

'I was struggling to connect with my friends and family. I couldn't work out how to balance everything. 

'I knew at that point I wasn't maintain healthy relationship and I was trying to figure out a balance between the two. 

Exciting time: Camilla has been sharing a steady stream of baby bump pictures on social media and has said she is 'very very happy'

She said: 'I was approached by one of the [Love Island] researchers, and just went through the process, it was going on in the background while I was really struggling. 

'So when they asked if I'd be in the opening cast I think if you're struggling with socialising, Love Island offers quite an immersive experience to talk and there are no other distractions.

'I had seen some episodes I think I tried to watch a few when they first contacted me, it was really interesting. 

'You can watch the show but when you're in it it's an entirely different experience, you forget about the cameras and what you see and what it's like.' 

Something for herself: Camilla was approached to go on Love Island at a time when she said she was 'struggling' after returning  from Afghanistan
