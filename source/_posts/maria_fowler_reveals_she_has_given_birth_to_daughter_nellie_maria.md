Taking to her Instagram Stories on Tuesday, she admitted that during her scan, she was trying to 'predict the baby's gender' but couldn't really tell at this point. 

Maria also voiced her upset that Kelvin was unable to be at the scan, saying: 'I know this is like major first world problems, but I just feel really disappointed that Kelvin couldn't come to the scan today.

'I did think that some clinics might be open with it being more medical, but literally there are no baby scan clinics open at the minute.'

She went on to explain that Kelvin had to wait in the car while she went in for her scan, but agreed in the current climate she understood the need to precautions.

She said: 'It's just really disappointing for the dads, because obviously they're part of the journey as well.

'And, I think it's hard sometimes for the dads to feel really part of it, because they're not the ones going through the changes and the pregnancy.

'So for them, that's their one bit of being, kind of, connected with the baby.
