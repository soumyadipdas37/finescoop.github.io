Edouard Mendy is on the brink of becoming a Chelsea player and the deal could be even be confirmed by Thursday night, according to his agent.

The 28-year-old has been pursued by the Blues as manager Frank Lampard wants a new goalkeeper to usurp much-maligned Kepa Arrizabalaga as his No 1.

Talks with Mendy's club Rennes have been ongoing but according to his agent Djily Dieng a significant breakthrough has happened.



'The deal with Chelsea is almost done. Only the formalisation is remaining,' he told Extra Time on Thursday afternoon. 

'It could be completed even on next hours'.
