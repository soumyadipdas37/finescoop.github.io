JobKeeper handouts have been officially extended for an extra six months with a new two-tiered approach, with all eligible workers losing at least $300.

Wage subsidies were introduced by the federal government to tide over workers until businesses reopened after lockdowns ended.

The scheme was supposed to end in September but on Tuesday it was extended until March 28, 2021.

A new split system will replace flat $1,500 subsidies paid each fortnight.

People who worked less than 20 hours a week before the crisis struck will be paid $750 a fortnight from the end of September, while all others will receive $1,200.

The maximum payment will then come down to $1,000 from December to March 2021. 

Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the wage subsidy scheme as the most significant economic intervention in Australia's history.

'We are now extending and transitioning,' Mr Morrison told coalition party room colleagues on Tuesday.

'Transitioning and looking to a day when Australian communities don't need JobKeeper and when Australians can then run their businesses and hold their jobs sustained by a vibrant and growing economy instead.'

The second tranche of JobKeeper payments is expected to cost more than $30 billion.  

Labor waved through the extension after failing to introduce a wage floor for workers who are no longer eligible for the scheme.

Independent senator Rex Patrick also could not secure enough support for an amendment to force businesses that have paid dividends or executive bonuses to repay the wage subsidies.
