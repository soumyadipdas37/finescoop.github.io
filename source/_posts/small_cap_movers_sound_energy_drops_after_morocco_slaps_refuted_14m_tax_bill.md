Sound Energy slipped 11 per cent to 1p this week after the Moroccan authorities slapped a $14million tax bill in relation to a previous transfer of interest between two of its subsidiaries.

The firm said this assessment is based on a misunderstanding and is formally refuting it.

Just over two months ago, the junior upstream company raised £2.75million reaching a cash balance of £4.2million, at the time estimated to last until next March.

The news is just the last blow for a stock that was trading at 93p just three years ago.

The explorer has focussed on gas assets in Italy and Morocco but ultimately disappointed in both countries.

The Italian portfolio was sold to Coro Energy in April 2018, when the Tendrara assets were still expected to hold 377bn cubic feet of recoverable gas based on analysis of just 1 per cent of the total permit area.

However, in May 2019 Sound did not find commercial flow rates so it started a partial divestment process.

No transaction has been completed as of today, but in the meantime chief executive James Parsons, chief financial officer JJ Traynor and exploration director Brian Mitchener have all jumped ship.
