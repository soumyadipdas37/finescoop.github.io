They have had an on-and-off relationship since first being linked in 2011, most recently splitting in January 2018. 

But AnnaLynne McCord and Dominic Purcell seem to have rekindled their romance yet again, as they packed on the PDA while laying out in Huntington Beach on Friday. 

The 33-year-old actress and the 50-year-old Prison Break star got cozy while enjoying the sand and surf. 

Back on? AnnaLynne McCord and Dominic Purcell seem to have rekindled their romance yet again, as they packed on the PDA while laying out in Huntington Beach on Friday 

The 90210 actress flaunted her toned abs in a purple bikini that featured a bandage-wrap style tip with a thick strap highlighting her trim waist. 

The low-rise bottoms and bustier top were teamed with gold slide-on sandals and a grey and black fringe kimono for coverage. 

She tied her blonde hair up in a high ponytail using a black bow scrunchie and often slipped on dark shades. 

While the Australian-born actor hit the waves in a black wet-suite top and grey swim trunks.

Dominic also let his hands wander, resting on the actress' curves and at one point seeming to whisper in AnnaLynne's ear. 

They were first linked in 2011, but went on to split in 2014, before rekindling their romance in 2016, after Dominic was diagnosed with skin cancer. 

'I’m very happy, I have my best friend back, so it’s cool,' she said on the Allegedly podcast after they reunited.

She went on to jokingly say that 'I gave up all my 20s for you' about the actor when he seemed surprised that she truly 'loved' him. 

'One of the things that's sexiest about him is how incredibly intelligent he is, and well read, and prolific and a big thinker,' AnnaLynne said at the time.  

After reuniting, they eventually splitting again in January 2018.

After their split was announced, AnnaLynne told Yahoo Lifestyle in January 2018 that they cross paths on occasion.

'I still see him from time to time,' she said. 'We're friends. We're not together anymore, but we are very close.' 

It's unclear when the couple reunited but they seemed to be more than friends yet again.
