She's the Sunrise host who never fails to put on a glamorous display on TV.

But on Tuesday, Samantha Armytage made a very relatable beauty confession.

The 44-year-old journalist admitted that she was having her first pedicure in nine months.

She wore a floral face mask while posing for a selfie on a comfy parlour chair, with a collection of nail polish bottles on the wall behind her. 

Samantha didn't reveal the state of her feet, but wrote in the post: 'I call this portrait; girl who hasn't had a pedicure in nine months...

'And it was bliss,' she added.

The last time she showed off her red pedicure was in February in a photo with co-host David Koch and weatherman Sam Mac at the Fire Fight Australia fundraiser.

Samantha rarely goes without red polish on her toes, as demonstrated by her Instagram posts from the past couple of years.  

She's likely avoided salons lately because of the coronavirus pandemic and due to her busy schedule.

It comes after Samantha recently told The Daily Telegraph that her wedding to businessman Richard Lavender was behind pushed back to 2021.

She explained that she hoped to have a large wedding but the pandemic had made that impossible, hence the delay.

'Because we want to have a party with more than 20 people, we have sort of put it on hold,' she said, adding that they 'will get there' in the end.

'We will get married, but [we've] put the planning on hold because there is no point until we can actually make a proper plan in booking anything,' she said.

'So no plans yet but we will get there.'

The broadcaster announced her engagement to Richard in late June this year. 

The couple began dating in April last year after meeting at a party, and confirmed their romance to WHO magazine in November.
