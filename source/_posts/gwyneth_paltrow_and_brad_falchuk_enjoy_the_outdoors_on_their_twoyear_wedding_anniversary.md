Two years after tying the knot in an intimate ceremony at their home in The Hamptons, Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk appear happier than ever. 

In celebration of their second wedding anniversary, the 48-year-old actress shared a glowing selfie with her husband on Tuesday. 

'Year two, through,' the Oscar winner captioned a loved-up snap of herself beaming next to Falchuk, who is best known for co-creating Glee, American Horror Story and Scream Queens with Ryan Murphy.

While flashing a bright smile next to her man, Paltrow put her sun-kissed skin on display under very minimal makeup. 

Meanwhile, the 49-year-old TV producer looked at ease with his hair tousled back as they stood in front of a glistening lake and lush heritage trees. 

This comes after the Emma actress posed nude and shared the image to Instagram for the 48th birthday.

Earlier on his wife's birthday, Falchuk raved about Paltrow's ability to make pizza from scratch, manage to never be late for cocktails and make 'looking good annoyingly easy.'

'She makes friends feel like family and family feel like friends. Trust me, she’s the best,' he gushed, after revealing she also 'never skips an opportunity to put an a**hole in his place.' 

The duo first met on the set of Glee in 2010, but didn't officially start dating until 2014, the same year she and ex-husband Chris Martin announced they were 'conscious uncoupling.'  

After three years of dating, Falchuk proposed in November 2017, and a year later the couple wed in a star-studded ceremony.

Just last summer, Gwyneth caused a stir when she admitted to The Sunday Times that the couple - though married - were not living together. The pair typically spend four days a week cohabitating with Brad returning to his Los Angeles property for the rest of the week. 

'All my married friends say that the way we live sounds ideal and we shouldn’t change a thing,' the blonde beauty said, less than a year before taking the plunge. 

The couple both have sets of kids with their exes. Gwyneth shares Apple, 16, and Moses, 14, with Coldplay's frontman and Brad has Isabella and Brody with his ex-wife Suzanne Falchuk. 

It appears as if the blended family of six has been quarantining together as Gwyneth recently said in a Goop video that she's been in 'pretty close quarters.'

The pair seemed to have been splitting time between the east and the west coast, as  Hollywood productions slowly start to open up safely amid COVID restrictions.  

Most recently, the producer and writer created a part for his wife in the Netflix smash hit The Politician.  

Co-created with his right hand man Ryan Murphy, Falchuk wrote the role of Georgina Hobart for Paltrow, a Montecito mom to protagonist Ben Platt's character Payton. 

Speaking about her husband's persistence to get her to play the part he had written, Paltrow revealed that she originally said 'no.' 

The actress who has recently pulled back from Hollywood amid her success from her lifestyle brand Goop, told her persistent husband that there was 'no way she could do it.'

In an interview with Elle magazine, Falchuk added, 'She’d show me a giant chunk of her dialogue and be like, ‘I have a [Goop] board meeting in two days. Please don’t make me do this' he said. 

Production eventually agreed to work around her schedule and the Hollywood power couple were back on set together for the first time since they met on the set of Glee in 2014. Gwyneth had a recurring role in the show  and Falchuk co-created the show with Murphy. 

Since her hiatus from acting, Gwyneth's lifestyle company Goop has exploded. The company was valued at $250 million in 2018 and seems to only be getting bigger. 

She first launched the company as a newsletter in 2008 and now the brand is a full lifestyle website with skincare products and wellness tips among other things.
