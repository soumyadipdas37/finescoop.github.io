Michael Schumacher's son Mick will make his Formula One debut in front of his home fans at the Nurburgring on October 9, it has been announced.

The Ferrari academy driver, 21, whose father is the legendary seven-time world champion, has been hotly-tipped for a big career in F1 and he will get his first taste of the main event at the next race on the calendar.

Schumacher will drive for Alfa Romeo in the first practice session at the Eifel Grand Prix, while his F2 rival Callum Ilott - an Englishman - will be behind the wheel of a Haas. Another F2 talent, Robert Shwartzman, will get his chance in the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi.

It is a huge milestone for Schumacher and comes just a stone's throw away from his home town. The Nurburgring is not currently on the F1 circuit but has been added this year on a much-changed schedule due to the coronavirus.

Responding to the news, Schumacher said: 'I am overjoyed to get this chance in free practice. The fact that my first participation in a Formula 1 weekend will take place in front of my home audience at the Nurburgring makes this moment even more special.

'For the next 10 days I'm going to prepare myself well, so that I can do the best possible job for the team and gain some valuable data for the weekend.'

Ilott described the test as 'a real privilege', and noted: 'It's amazing to have this chance at a track that is one of my favourites - it was where I scored the first podium of my career back in 2015.'

Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies, also the director of Ferrari's driver academy, said: 'We wanted to organise this test session so that our three best youngsters would be as well prepared as possible to tackle an event that will always be a special moment for them.

'It will be a chance to get to grips with a Formula 1 car, which is much more complicated than the car they are currently used to driving.'

As it stands, Schumacher leads the F2 drivers' championship in his bid to follow in his father's footsteps and become an F1 driver, while Ilott and Shwartzman are second and fifth respectively.

Schumacher and Ilott are in the Ferrari academy and so will be given a chance in Ferrari's two customer teams Alfa Romeo and Haas.

Sergio Perez is among the experienced drivers still trying to claim a drive for the 2021 season

Both drivers - as well as Shwartzman - are battling it out for a lucrative seat in F1, and if one becomes available it is likely to be with either Alfa or Haas.

Antonio Giovinazzi and Kimi Raikkonen currently hold the two seats at Alfa, while Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen are in at Haas. 

As it stands, both Alfa and Haas have not confirmed their driver line-ups for 2021 but it could be all change, with Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg also without a drive and desperate to continue in the sport.
