Grime rapper Bugzy Malone is on trial facing two counts of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, just months after he was nearly killed in a motorbike crash.

The musician, real name Aaron Davis, wore a black leather jacket, flat cap and a mask and sunglasses as he arrived at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court yesterday. 

Davis, 29, of Ramsbottom, Greater Manchster, spoke only to confirm his name as a seven-day trial date was fixed for September 6 next year.

No other details were given at the hearing but Davis has denied the charges.  

It comes just months after the rapper was involved in a near-fatal motorbike crash in March and revealed he was 'lucky to be alive'.

Davis took to social media from his hospital bed at the time to share his injuries with the world and reassure fans he was 'ok' after he was thrown off the vehicle in a collision in Bury, Greater Manchester.

It comes just months after the rapper (pictured performing at the We Are Manchester concert in 2017) was involved in a near-fatal motorbike crash in March and revealed he was 'lucky to be alive'

The rapper took to Twitter to thank well-wishers for their messages of support and prayers

Initial images from the scene showed the rapper left dazed and lying on his back on the kerbside from facial injuries after he crashed into an Audi.  

Taking to Twitter the musician wrote: 'They tell me i'm lucky to be alive, I sustained serious injuries and at the time I lost consciousness but what I do remember is the none stop love, and just want to say thanks for all the well wishes and prayers you lot caught me off guard with all the support! #ImOk.'  

The rapper had been riding on what appeared to be a motorised trike through Manchester in March when an Audi pulled out of a T-junction - giving the grime star no time to react before he ploughed into driver's door.

Footage from the incident then showed Malone's bike falling onto its side and he was thrown from his vehicle in front of shocked onlookers who raced to his aid.

The songwriter, famed for his album King Of The North, was left lying on his back on the kerbside with blood pouring from his facial injuries, with one bystander saying it appeared his nose was 'hanging off'. 

Witness Lewis McMullen shared a clip of the performer clearly dazed and surrounded by shattered glass in the aftermath of the collision.

It is unclear if the driver of the Audi, which was left with smashed bodywork and windows, was injured in the collision. 

Following the crash, the musician's management team said he was being monitored in hospital and his injuries were not believed to be life-threatening.

The Bugzy Malone Team tweeted: 'I can now confirm that @TheBugzyMalone is in a stable condition. He remains in hospital whilst being monitored and assessed.

'He would love privacy for him and his family while recovering so let us leave him at peace until stable enough to make a comeback on social media.'  

They later added: 'It's been a very craaazy last 24hrs which was not obviously intended & shows how quick life can turn.

'I just wanted to say to everyone who has wished and prayed for bugzy & anyone in general, stay safe and keep healthy, keep your loved ones close and live your life! Thank You.'
