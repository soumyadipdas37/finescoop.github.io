Jason Statham and Guy Ritchie are getting back to work with one another.

The 53-year-old actor and vaunted filmmaker, 51, are set to collaborate on a spy thriller titled Five Eyes, Deadline reported on Thursday.

The duo have previously worked together on films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Revolver and Wrath of Man.

Reunited: Jason Statham, 53, and Guy Ritchie, 51, are set to collaborate on a spy thriller titled Five Eyes 

In the movie, Statham will portray a MI6 guns-and-steel agent who aligns with Five Eyes, an international intelligence agency, to cease the sale of weapons that could lead to deadly international conflicts.

Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies (The Gentlemen) will pen then screenplay to the thriller, which will be financed and produced by Miramax and STXfilms.

'Jason is a global box office heavy weight, and when teamed with Guy Ritchie, that’s an irresistible combination,' STXfilms Adam Fogelson told the outlet. 'It’s a thrill to be back in business with Guy, Bill and the team at Miramax after our shared success on The Gentlemen and we believe Five Eyes is the kind of film our partners overseas will love as much as we do.'

Miramax's Bill Block added: 'Guy Ritchie’s Five Eyes is his next collaboration with Jason, commencing with Snatch, following the upcoming film, Wrath of Man and the global success of The Gentlemen, in partnership with STXfilms.'

'We’re excited to be reunited with the STX team, as well as Ritchie and Statham whose undeniable chemistry, philosophy and talent will surely attract a massive appeal from audiences worldwide.'

In recent years, Statham's films have been box office gold, with smashes such as 2019's Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, which has made $759 million in worldwide box office; and 2018's The Meg, which made $530 million internationally.

The film's principal photography is currently scheduled next month in Europe, according to the outlet.
