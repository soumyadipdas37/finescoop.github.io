A hiker, 43, plunged 100 feet to his death from a tree after a branch snapped while he was posing for a photo along the Devil's Cauldron trail in Oregon. 

Steven Gastelum, from Seaside, died Sunday when he fell over a cliff edge at Oswald West State Park, north of Manzanita, and plummeted into the ocean below.  

The tragic incident unfolded when Gastelum was hiking with another person along the Devil's Cauldron trail on the Oregon Coast.

The pair went to a cliff side viewpoint to take a photo, according to Oregon State Police.

Gastelum then climbed a tree on the edge of the drop to pose for a picture, said investigators.

A tree limb snapped sending him falling 100 feet into the water below.

Emergency personnel were called to reports of a man falling off a cliff edge at around 1:48 p.m.  

Responders from the Nehalem Bay Fire Department on jet skies and a US Coast Guard helicopter were drafted in in the search for Gastelum.

The hiker was located and pulled to shore, where he was rushed to Tillamook Regional Medical Center.

Gastelum was later pronounced dead at the hospital. 

His death comes almost exactly three years after the death of another hiker along the same steep trail in Oswald West State Park.

Joe Lescene, 51, died in September 2017 after he lost his footing on the cliff edge overlooking Devil's Cauldron and fell more than 780 feet into the sea.  

The father-of-two from Vancouver Island was hiking with his wife Sarah in the park when he fell over the cliff edge. 

Gastelum climbed a tree on the edge of the drop to pose for a picture, said investigators. A tree limb snapped sending him falling 100 feet into the water below. He was pulled from the water by rescue teams but was pronounced dead in hospital

The couple visited the Oregon park every year for a romantic getaway.

The US Coast Guard, Oregon State Police and four groups of local emergency responders tried to find him for five days before the search was called off.

His body washed up on a beach on September 20, 10 days after he went missing.  

The Devil's Cauldron is a viewing point at the end of a short trail in the park.  

It is a popular spot for hiking, walking and bird watching.
