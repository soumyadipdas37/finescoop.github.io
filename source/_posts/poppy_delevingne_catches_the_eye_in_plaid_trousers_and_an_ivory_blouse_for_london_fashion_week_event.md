Poppy, who has had small roles in The Aspern Papers and Kingsmen: The Golden Circle, most recently starred in the second series of Sky Atlantic's Riviera.

A successful model, Poppy has graced the covers of Harpers Bazaar, Glamour and starred in campaigns alongside her younger sibling Cara, who has been listed as one of the world's highest earning models by Forbes magazine.

Poppy and Cara recently purchased a £1.5 million home together in Los Angeles due to them both having to fly over so often for work commitments. 

Poppy said although she hasn't had pressure to live up to her family name, she's had to work her 'heart and soul out' to achieve her goals and would hate to have nepotism overshadow her accomplishments.
