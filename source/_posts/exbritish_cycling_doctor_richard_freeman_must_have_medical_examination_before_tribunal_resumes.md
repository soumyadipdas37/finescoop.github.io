Richard Freeman, the former British Cycling and Team Sky medic, has been ordered to undergo an independent medical examination before his tribunal resumes next month.

The doctor has been accused of ordering testosterone to British Cycling's headquarters in 2011 to boost an athlete's performance, which he denies.

Freeman's hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service began last October but was adjourned in December because he was too unwell to give evidence.

The tribunal was then due to restart in May but was postponed again because of the coronavirus pandemic and is now scheduled to resume on October 6 and run until November 26.

At a virtual pre-hearing yesterday, Freeman's QC, Ms Mary O'Rourke QC, said Freeman was in 'good health' and had been working at a GP's surgery.

However, it was decided that Freeman's physical and mental health must be independently checked before the tribunal can resume in full.

The tribunal directions, which were published yesterday, stated that: 'Dr Freeman be made available to undergo a medical examination by an independent expert appointed by the General Medical Council in the week commencing 14 September 2020.

'The GMC is also given the discretion to instruct a second expert to examine Dr Freeman during the week commencing 21 September 2020, and to produce a report on the doctor's mental health for disclosure by no later than 25 September 2020.'

Freeman has admitted 18 of 22 charges against him, which include ordering 30 sachets of Testogel to the Manchester Velodrome in 2011, lying to try to cover up the order and lying to a UK Anti-Doping investigation.

But he has contested four charges, which relate to ordering the banned substance knowing or believing it was intended to enhance an athlete's performance.
