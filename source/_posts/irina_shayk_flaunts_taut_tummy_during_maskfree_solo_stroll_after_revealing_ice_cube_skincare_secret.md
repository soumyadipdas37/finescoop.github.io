'I grew up in very cold weather,' Shayk explained in the 10-minute tutorial.

'When I wake up or travel, and feel a little swollen [with] bags under my eyes, I run to the fridge and I get an ice cube, and [glide it] all around my eye area, my chin, [and] all around my face.'

Irina wrapped up in a gold Versace robe as she recommended using 12 different products ranging in price from $30 Pat McGrath Labs Dark Star Volumizing Mascara to $394 Mimi Luzon 24K Pure Gold One Treatment.
