She is usually out in the countryside in Kent, tending to her nine horses.

But Summer Monteys-Fullam headed for a girls' night out in Mayfair on Thursday.

The stunning red-head, 25, turned heads as she showcased her ample cleavage and toned abs in a low-scoop cropped white vest top.

Summer teamed the look with white ripped jeans, a Gucci belt and draped a jacket over her shoulders. 

She added a boost to her height with brown open toe heels and accessorised her all-white ensemble with sunglasses and a quilted bag.

The ex of Paul Hollywood wore her ginger locks in a sleek straight style and enhanced her bronzed tan with a glamorous make-up look.

Fabrizio played Ziggy Roscoe in Channel 4's Hollyoaks between 2013 and 2015, and was previously linked to Danniella Westbrook. 

Summer has been living with her mother Sabina and the family at their rural home ever since moving back in following her break-up with Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood, 54, last year.

Her sole focus has been on her seven horses and two foals - Rainbow and Storm. 

She previously admitted how she was 'besotted' with Paul when their romance first began but was warned by her mother that relationship could 'explode'. 

Summer dated the TV star for two years before the relationship imploded in arguments and legal battles.
