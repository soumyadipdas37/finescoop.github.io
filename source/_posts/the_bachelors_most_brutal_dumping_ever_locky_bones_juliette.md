Outspoken Bachelor star Juliette Herrera made an unforgettable exit from the show on Wednesday's episode.

The 34-year-old stylist ranted at Locky Gilbert about ignoring 'DMs' from other men because she was saving herself for him - only to be brutally dumped moments later.

Fans couldn't believe what they were watching, with hundreds flocking to Twitter to talk about Juliette's surreal departure.

'I'm screaming Juliette just left... What a queen,' one viewer tweeted. 

'Juliette has surprisingly become the MVP,' another added, while a third commented: 'Juliette for the Bachelorette 2021.'

Just before being sent home, Juliette confronted 31-year-old Locky about not having had a single date with him.

But before he had a chance to explain himself, she launched into a cringeworthy rant about the fact she was ignoring direct messages on Instagram for him.

'I messaged you and tried to reach out to you,' Juliette said. 

'I thought, does he know that in my DMs I'm not replying to, like, certain people from LA? I could be talking to TikTok stars and rappers. But I'm ignoring them for you. Like, Young Thug's producer and The Chainsmokers.'  

'I have to remember who I am!' Just before being sent home, Juliette confronted Locky Gilbert about not having a single date with him. She then went on a cringeworthy rant about ignoring direct messages on Instagram for him

'I … I don't know who that is,' Locky said. 

'Harvey Luna – with four million TikTok followers – follows me and talks to me!' she said.  

Juliette defiantly added: 'I have to remember who I am. Hello! I'm amazing!'

'And if that's too confronting for Locky, then just get rid of me. Because I have DMs to go back to.'

Soon after, Juliette is seen getting driven home from the mansion.   

'I think it was the right thing to send Juliette home. I mean, I don't think she's the right person for me,' Locky said. 

Shocked: 'I think it was the right thing to send Juliette home. I mean, I don't think she's the right person for me,' Locky said

During Wednesday's episode, Juliette wasn't the only one sent packing from the mansion. 

Teachers Maddy Carver and Steph Harper were booted from the show, after they both failed to score a rose from the handsome adventure seeker.  

Elsewhere, Locky intercepted Bella Varelis to question her about her intentions after she accused Irena Srbinovska of 'manipulating her way through the show'.

While it didn't look promising for the petite brunette, Locky eventually handed his final rose to Bella. 

The remaining women competing for Locky's love include Bella Varelis, Irena Srbinovska, Izzy Sharman-Firth, Kaitlyn Hoppe and intruder Bec Cvilikas.
