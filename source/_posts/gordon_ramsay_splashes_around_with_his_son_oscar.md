He has been spending time at his lavish £4.4million holiday home in Cornwall. 

And Gordon Ramsay was every inch the doting dad as he gave his youngest son Oscar, 15 months, swimming lessons in his breathtaking pool in Rock on Monday. 

The chef, 53, smiled with his adorable son who sported a sweet top-knot along with his black-and-tan spaniel Bruno in the stunning pool overlooking Porthilly Cove.

Gordon, who is married to Tana Ramsay, 45, looked relaxed as he splashed around with Oscar in the pool boasting a transparent wall which can cost up to £50,000. 

The father-of-five opted for a black short-sleeved t-shirt and shorts as he cradled the toddler in the turquoise water. 

Meanwhile Gordon put safety first with Oscar wearing a blue swimming vest layered over a shark-themed swimsuit and his blonde locks tied up out of his face.

'Porthilly beach which has some of the most delicious oysters and mussels anywhere in the world,' he narrated. 

'Simply stunning. How could you not love Cornwall?' he gushed, taking in the blue skies.

Gordon took to Instagram last week to share a snap of Oscar on his shoulders in front of the pool, after demolishing the original five-bedroom mansion on the site to build two new properties there. 

The chef has faced complaints from locals for demolishing his 1920's clifftop home to build two new homes, with neighbours accusing him of bringing 'Legoland to Cornwall.'

Posting the snap, Gordon, posing with his youngest son Oscar, 15 months, penned the caption: 'Off for an evening walk with @oscarjramsay.'

Hello! Oscar looked curiously at the camera lens as he sat comfortably in the baby carrier 

One of the swimming pool's unique selling points comes from its transparent wall overlooking the stunning River Camel.

In a snap of Gordon's sprawling new Cornish property, which underwent renovations earlier this year, the pool can be seen in the centre of the outside area. 

As well as enjoying the new addition to his home, Gordon was seen taking a family walk on Monday morning with his family. 

The chef was accompanied by wife Tana and three of their five children - Jack, 20, Matilda, 18, and Oscar - during a brisk morning walk across the sand. 

Wow! Gordon first shared a glimpse of his incredible new swimming pool at his £4.4million holiday home in an Instagram snap last week

Gordon has faced backlash from locals for demolishing the original five-bedroom property that had been on the site in Rock, Cornwall, which he bought for £4.4 million in 2015. 

At the time, it was the second most expensive sale ever recorded in Cornwall and infuriated local residents.

The TV chef, originally from Johnstone, Renfrewshire, was granted planning permission by Cornwall Council to replace the 1920s property with a main house and a smaller second property, known as 'The Garden House'. 

Perfect spot: 'Porthilly beach which has some of the most delicious oysters and mussels anywhere in the world,' he narrated

The new house, has two kitchens, a swimming pool, a wine cellar and four en suite bathrooms, around 100 yards from the beach. 

Gordon was also given the green light to construct a three-bedroom grass-covered boathouse just a stone's throw from water at high tide. 

Nearly 20 people wrote to Cornwall Council to complain that the Garden House, about 25 metres from the shore, would spoil the designated area of outstanding natural beauty and damage other residents' view.

This is the life: 'Now that is what I call a August bank holiday, look at that, beautiful,' he captioned Sunday's video, as the family spent the long weekend at their beach retreat

Councillors gave the application the thumbs up on the basis that other properties were not overlooked.

At the time, a spokesman for Ramsay tried to diffuse the row saying: 'Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall.

'They are committed to contributing to, and delighted to be investing in, the future of the Cornish community they will hopefully be a part of for many years.'
