Golden Globe winner Jennifer Garner's eldest daughter Violet was taller than her as they took a hand-in-hand stroll near their $17.6M Pacific Palisades home on Tuesday.

The Texan-born, West Virginia-raised 48-year-old and her 14-year-old girl protected themselves and others from COVID-19 by wearing masks, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for public outings on June 18.

As of Tuesday, there have been over 261K confirmed coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 6,367 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University.

In the last two years, Violet has experienced a noticeable growth spurt thanks to genes from her famous father Ben Affleck, who stands 6ft4in tall.

Jennifer and the 48-year-old Oscar-winning filmmaker - who are also parents of daughter Seraphina, 11; and son Samuel, 8 - put an end to their decade-long marriage in October 2018.

Ben has since fell in love with Golden Globe nominee Ana de Armas, whom he met on the New Orleans set of erotic thriller Deep Water hitting US theaters on November 13 and UK theaters on November 20.

In Touch Weekly reported last month that Garner split with Cali Group chairman John Miller 'before LA went into lockdown' in March following two years of low-key dating.

Nowadays, the Neutrogena brand ambassador has been 'playing board games every night' like Ticket to Ride: Europe but her daughter 'kills me.'

'My middle daughter and I have secretly been watching America's Funniest Home Videos at night just the two of us. We both say we just need to laugh, we need to see someone get hit in the crotch with a baseball bat,' Jen told Woman's Day on Tuesday.
