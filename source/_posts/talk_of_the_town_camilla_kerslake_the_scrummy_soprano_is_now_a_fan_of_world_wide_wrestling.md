It's so good to see the live entertainment world coming back to life post lockdown but, boy, are there some wacky shows coming up.

Camilla Kerslake, nicknamed the Scrummy Soprano thanks to her romance with former England rugby captain Chris Robshaw – is set to appear in a wrestling-themed production at the Cockpit Theatre and then the Playground Theatre in London this month. 

Bread And Circuses is described as ‘a mash-up between World Wrestling Entertainment, verismo opera, and 1990s-style video-gaming’.

Owing to Covid-19 restrictions, performances run for just 20 minutes. Just as well – it all sounds exhausting!

Ramsay's boy racer 

You can almost hear Gordon Ramsay cursing in the background as his son Oscar speeds around his plush Los Angeles home in an electric ride-on Land Rover.

He may have only been walking for a few months, but the 17-month-old, left, is already a natural behind the wheel. 

The £250, 12-volt toy car tootles along at 3mph and is even adorned with a personal registration plate. 

The chef shared the snap on Instagram with the caption: ‘17 months old and already driving.’

The car is missing a few letters from the logo on the front – I do hope Oscar hasn’t had a prang already!

It was one of the most exclusive selfie spots of all – but Annabel’s nightclub has now banned members from snapping pouty poses in its powder rooms. 

The loos were the only area where guests were allowed to take pictures after a £55 million club makeover – and 25,000 selfies were taken. 

But new rules forbid cameras anywhere in the club ‘including bathrooms’.
