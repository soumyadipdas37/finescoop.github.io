His efforts to achieve a more lithe frame have been well documented, most notably during his stint on Channel 5's Get A Holiday Body: Lose A Stone In 4 Weeks in 2018.

And Antony Costa has revealed that he's achieved a 1st weight loss in just four weeks once again, when he took to Instagram to unveil his newly slimmed down body.

The Blue singer, 39, shared before and after snaps of himself posing shirtless as he showed his smaller torso this week, an achievement which left him feeling 'amazing'.

Antony Costa revealed that he's achieved a 1st weight loss in just four weeks once again on Thursday, when he took to Instagram to unveil his newly slimmed down body

Explaining that his weight loss was achieved with a new diet and fitness overhaul, the star enthused: '4 weeks in and 1 stone down!!!'

'I feel amazing, healthier and fitter than I have in years,' Anthony added, before going on to reveal that he has been receiving meal deliveries to help him reach his goal.

He wrote: 'This just goes to show how important your diet is! I've been smashing the gym too but the plan makes it so so easy for me to keep on top of everything.

Accountability: The Blue singer, pictured three weeks into his three-month regime, has opted to document his weight loss journey on social media to aid in 'accountability'

'I get all my food delivered to my door every week. That's breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks sorted for me for 7 days! It couldn't be easier. Plus I get to eat pizza, pasta and all sorts of other food that I LOVE while still getting results!'

However, the musician won't be resting on his laurels just yet, as he's only one third of the way into his plan – as he revealed when embarking on his journey in August.

Alongside snaps of himself posing in his kitchen, the father-of-two wrote: 'I’ve challenged myself to get rid of my “dad bod” over the next 12 weeks and this plan is going to help me get there! So I’m posting these pics to keep myself accountable!'

He confessed: 'I’ve always struggled with managing my weight and lockdown didn’t help… I can’t wait to get cracking.'

After sporting a fuller frame at the start of 2018, the star made an appearance on ITV's Lorraine, where he revealed he had lost 16lbs. 

Discussing his appearance on Channel 5's Get A Holiday Body: Lose A Stone In 4 Weeks, he told host Lorraine Kelly that he had lost more than a stone. 

He also explained that he did the show for himself and his family as he didn't want to be 'that dad' running around out of breath in the park with his two daughters, Savannah Rosa and Paloma Valentina. 

The star, who has been with his  Rosanna Jasmin since 2012, said: 'I feel on top of the world, Lorraine, a different person.' 

Meals: 'I feel amazing, healthier and fitter than I have in years,' Anthony added, before going on to reveal that he has been receiving meal deliveries to help him reach his goal

Antony was then showed a photograph of himself at the start of the series, where he looked unhappy and had his arms crossed.

Talking about the snap, he said: 'It was just my posture and the way I was standing, I was not happy in myself. As the weeks got on, my posture got better, I feel great - ready to take on the world.'

He added: 'People have been so complimentary, people tweeting me on social media, saying, "You're an inspiration!"

'I never suffered from mental health, but I had insecurities, if I was with the boys [his fellow Blue bandmates Duncan James, Lee Ryan and Simon Webbe] not feeling myself, I would think if I was on TV, [for example]: "Lorraine is not going to talk to me because I look rubbish."

'I've turned a negative into a positive, I'm going to take on the world now. It was my insecurities I had to get out of, I did the show for myself and my family.

'I didn't want to be that dad running out of breath in the park. I have done this show and loved every minute of it, I've learnt how to cook!'

He added: 'I haven't touched the bad stuff for two and a half months, I want to get to that stage where I'm happy with myself and I can have a cheat day then go to the gym the next day.

'The gym has taken over my life, I love it, Lorraine. I feel great, that's just me, I'm so happy with myself.'

North London native Antony shot to fame alongside his Blue bandmates Simon Webbe, Lee Ryan, and Duncan James back in 2001 with their debut single All Rise and their follow-up release, a chart-topping cover of Next's R&B hit Too Close.
