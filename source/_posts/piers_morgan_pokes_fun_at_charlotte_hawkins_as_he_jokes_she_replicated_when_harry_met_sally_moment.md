Piers Morgan poked fun at Charlotte Hawkins on Monday's Good Morning Britain, as he claimed she'd replicated one of the sauciest moments in film history. 

As they discussed her appearance on Sunday's edition of Celebrity Catchphrase, Piers joked that he recognised her animated reaction from 1989's When Harry Met Sally, when Sally Albright (played by Meg Ryan) fakes an orgasm. 

Charlotte was left red-faced as Piers then mimicked the famous scene, leaving co-host Susanna Reid struggling to hide her laughter.

After Charlotte shared snaps of her excited reaction on Instagram, Piers noted that he'd her facial expressions somewhere before.

He said: 'She posted this, her own reaction to the show, and I suddenly had this flashback to where I've seen this before.' 

The screen then showed glimpses of the famous scene when Sally proves that women can fake an orgasm by brazenly replicating in a busy restaurant.

Cheeky: Unable to resist poking fun at his co-host, Piers added: 'When you won, did you go yes, yes, YES!' before repeating the film's famous quote: 'I'll have what she's having'

An embarrassed Charlotte squealed 'No!' after seeing the comparison.

Explaining why she shared the snaps of her animated reaction, she said: 'I thought it summed up what I'd gone through, the whole process.'

Unable to resist poking fun at his co-host, Piers added: 'When you won, did you go yes, yes, YES!' before repeating the film's famous quote: 'I'll have what she's having.'

Oh dear! A red-faced Charlotte shouted 'No!' as they flashed up the comparison 

Success! During her stint on Celebrity Catchphrase, Charlotte succeeded in raising more than £15,000 for the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association

Throughout the exchange Susanna struggled to hide her laughter, before eventually continuing with the show.

Charlotte appeared alongside Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling and Coronation Street's Andy Whyment on the star-studded edition of the game show.

The star succeeded in raising more than £15,000 for the Motor Neurone Disease Association. 

It comes as Piers also revealed that he'd drafted in the help of Sarah Lindsay to put together a new fitness regime, after gaining half a stone during lockdown.
