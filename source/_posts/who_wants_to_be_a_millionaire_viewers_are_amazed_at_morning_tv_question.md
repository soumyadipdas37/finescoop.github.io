She was given the options: 'A. Dickinson's Real Deal; B. GMTV; C. Loose Women; D. This Morning.'

PhD Psychology student appeared confident in her answer and quickly dismissed This Morning and Loose Women before adding: 'GMTV is the one that makes the most sense... I'm 90 per cent sure it's "B".' However she still asked to use the 50/50 lifeline

PhD Psychology student appeared confident in her answer and quickly dismissed This Morning and Loose Women before adding: 'GMTV is the one that makes the most sense... I'm 90 per cent sure it's "B".' 

However she still decided to use the 50/50 lifeline and had two of the four answers eliminated, leaving her with GMTV and Loose Women. 

The narrowing of the field gave Laura the boost she needed and she answered: 'Okay, easy. It's GMTV. Final answer.' 



The first Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? winner in 14 years will be crowned tonight.

The winner, whose identity has not been revealed, is understood to be a man who answered the 15 questions to reach the jackpot in 'record time'. 

Jeremy Clarkson has already described the winner as the 'best contestant ever' and said he or she 'whizzed through'.

The winner will be just the sixth millionaire to triumph on the ITV show since its launch in 1998. 

But seconds later she was left with her head in her hands when presenter Jeremy Clarkson told her: 'It's the wrong answer'. 

The shock on Laura's face was clear and she said, 'No! What?' Before the host admitted: 'I am struggling to think of anything to say to make you feel better. I'm so sorry.' 

The moment left viewers at home frustrated, with one taking to Twitter to share: 'I knew it was This Morning! GMTV started in 1993, then Daybreak in 2010 and now Good Morning Britain started in 2014 and TV AM was from 1983 to 1992 #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire.'

Another wrote: 'Omg that girl then how did she just dismiss This Morning has she never heard of Richard and Judy #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire.'

A third added: 'It was #ThisMorning all day long. She should have phoned me Hugging face #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire.' 

Before leaving the show with £1,000, Laura answered six other questions on a range of topics.
