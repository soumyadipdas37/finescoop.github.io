Charlotte Dawson and Matthew Sarsfield discovered they're having a boy as they hosted their gender reveal party in Blackpool on Monday, just days after announcing their engagement.

The pregnant reality star, 27, and the rugby league footballer, 28, appeared over the moon as they shared a kiss to mark the special occasion, held at the Beach House Bistro. 

Surrounded by friends and family, the couple couldn't contain their excitement as they popped a Prince or Princess balloon to reveal blue confetti.

Wahay! Charlotte Dawson and Matthew Sarsfield discovered they're having a boy as they hosted their gender reveal party on Monday, just days after announcing their engagement

Sharing their delight, the daughter of late comedian Les Dawson told OK! magazine: 'So excited, we’re having a chuffing boy! We’re having a mini Matt! A mini Matt and a mini Les together!

'I just am so excited to have a boy! So excited! A mummy’s boy!'

Cradling her growing baby bump, the Ex On The Beach star looked typically radiant in a white off-shoulder jumpsuit, which featured 70s-inspired trousers and a bow cape which ran down her back.

The make-up artist couldn't help but show off her new engagement ring, which complemented her silver watch and bedazzled clutch.

Handsome Matt opted for a slightly dressed-down appearance as he sported a two-tone T-shirt, jeans and trainers. 

The TV stars have celebrated many milestones in recent weeks, as they announced their expecting their first child together last month and confirmed their engagement over the weekend.

Charlotte - who is due to give birth just a week before what would have been her dad's 90th birthday in February 2021 - took to Instagram to share the news after her beau got down on one knee in front of Les' statue at Memorial park in Lancashire.

The funnyman passed away from a heart attack in 1993 aged just 62 when she was just eight months old.
