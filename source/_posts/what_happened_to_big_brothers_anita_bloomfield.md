She made history as the first ever 'intruder' on the inaugural season of Big Brother Australia in 2001.

But a lot has changed for Anita Bloomfield since then.

Now known by her married name Anita Birges, the 40-year-old has found success as a popular lifestyle influencer specialising in decluttering and organising.

Remember her? She made history as the first ever 'intruder' on the inaugural season of Big Brother Australia in 2001 - but a lot has changed for Anita Bloomfield since then 

She also works as a property stylist and consultant, and makes regular appearances on the Today show. 

Anita shares tips on how to organise your home with her 16,000 Instagram followers.

The former reality star married husband Ryan earlier this week, and the couple are currently enjoying their honeymoon.

Anita entered the Big Brother house on day 38 of the first season, and lasted almost three weeks before being evicted by her fellow housemates.

While she made history as Australia's first ever Big Brother intruder, she wasn't alone.

At the time, she entered the house with fellow intruder Rachel Corbett, who has also carved out a career in the spotlight.

Rachel is now a regular panellist on The Project as well as a popular podcaster. 

In an interview in 2009, Rachel admitted that she was trying to distance herself from her reality TV past to further her career in television and radio.

'It's part of my past that I've tried to distance myself from, and have so far succeeded,' she told Radio Info.

Big Brother was recently rebooted by Seven with a brand new format and style.
