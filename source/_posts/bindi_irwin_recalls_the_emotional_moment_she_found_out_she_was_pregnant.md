Bindi Irwin has opened up about the incredible moment she found out she was pregnant with her first child.

In an emotional Instagram post, the 22-year-old revealed that husband Chandler Powell was making a cup of tea when she broke the exciting news. 

She accompanied the post with a photo of herself cuddling up to Chandler, covering her baby bump in an oversized Australia Zoo jumper.

'Discovering that I was going to become a mother will forever be a moment where time stood still,' she wrote. 

'I took a test and ran into the kitchen where Chandler was making us tea,' she continued.

'He didn’t hear me come in so I speechlessly watched him pouring the water into my most loved hedgehog mug.'

Bindi said that the news changed their future forever and left her filled with tears of joy. 

'This news would change the course of our future in the best way. I started crying tears of pure joy and told my sweetheart husband that my test was positive,' she added.

The discovery led to the pair sitting down over a cup of tea to discuss their lives together. 

'We sat together with tea talking about the future and how we were going to share such wonderful, life changing news with the people that we love,' wrote Bindi.

'In that short span of time the gorgeous baby I'm carrying became the most important part of our lives.

'It is such a blessing knowing that this tiny person has chosen us as parents,' she added, before stating that the baby would be loved by both their families and the entire Australia Zoo team.

'I can’t wait to find out what this amazing new soul loves in life, and experience the world all over again through their eyes,' she finished.

Bindi and Chandler were married on March 25, in a makeshift ceremony at Australia Zoo.

The couple met close to seven years ago in November 2013 when Chandler, who hails from Florida, was touring Australia for a wakeboarding competition.
