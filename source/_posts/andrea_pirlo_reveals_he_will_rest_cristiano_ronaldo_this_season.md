Andrea Pirlo appears to already be very comfortable in his new role as Juventus manager, and may even take the surprising decision to rest Cristiano Ronaldo at times this season.

Ronaldo isn't one to sit on the sidelines, but with the star man turning 36 this season, there comes a time where even his legs may need a break.

'When it comes to less important games, we'll try to give him a rest,' Pirlo told Sky Sports Italia.

New Juventus boss Andrea Pirlo has said the Portuguese star knows his body's limits

Juventus got their first win of the new Serie A campaign against Sampdoria on Sunday, a routine 3-0 victory in which Ronaldo got on the score sheet. 

Pirlo is already putting new tactics into practice, particularly when it came to giving Aaron Ramsey more agency in midfield. 

Ronaldo looked just as good as he always has in recent years, but Pirlo knows what it's like to come towards the end of your career, having done so just a few years ago.

'We are thinking about it and talks it over,' he said when asked whether Ronaldo would be part of his squad rotation this year.

The global star is now 35-years-old, so may not be able to play as often as he once did

'He's not tired yet, as we just started, but when we come up to less important games, we'll try to give him a rest.

'He's a very intelligent lad who knows his body very well, so he is aware of when it's time to rest or to step it up.' 

With the amount of work Ronaldo puts into his body, it still seems unlikely we'll see him on the bench that often this season. 

Pirlo will be in charge as Juventus aim for their 10th Serie A title in a row, and they're off to a good start. Next up they'll play Roma away.
