Former My Kitchen Rules star Ash Pollard is counting down the weeks until she welcomes her first child with partner Pete Ferne.

But on Tuesday, the 34-year-old shared her dismay at recent COVID-19 restrictions which saw many hospitals in Melbourne temporarily ban water baths and showers for women in labour.

Posting on her Instagram story, the radio presenter explained that while she is normally a 'glass half full' person the news has made her feel 'anxious' and 'lonely'.

'No showers or water baths for women enduring labour at the mo due to COVID-19 restrictions in hospital. It's one blow after the other for mums to be,' she wrote. 

'I know I'll look back on this pregnancy and have the most outrageous stories to tell about growing a babe in a pandemic but for reals, it's probs the loneliest and most anxious I've ever been in my life. 

'And I'm a glass half full kinda foxy Cleopatra,' she added.
