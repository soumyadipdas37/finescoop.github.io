She has been flaunting her slimmed-down frame in recent months. 

And Gemma Collins looked every inch the natural beauty as she went makeup-free for her Instagram on Sunday and revealed how 'imperfection is beauty'.  

The Diva Forever star, 39, showcased her radiant complexion and made a peace sign in the snap as she described how 'you hardly recognise people in real life anymore'.

Gemma wore her blonde tresses in natural beach waves and appeared to embrace the stripped-back look as she posed for the selfie. 

The TV personality offered a glimpse of a lacy black bralette as she shared a Marilyn Monroe quote for her Instagram post. 

Gemma also thanked The London Aesthetics for her non-invasive HIFU facial which uses ultrasound energy to encourage the production of collagen in the skin.

On Friday, she took to Instagram to upload a snap of herself in grey loungewear as she posed on a plush sofa with a rose in her mouth.

'[T]he countdown begins my beautiful luxury lounge wear designed by moi will be available from next week.' 

 Trim: 'I believe that all bodies are beautiful, but if you want to make a change its really powerful to do it from a health-first perspective', Gemma said (pictured on Monday)

Talking to PlayOJO bingo on Wednesday, Gemma opened up about her weight loss journey, as she revealed: 'I use Skinny Jabs – it's a programme that I am on and I have managed to lost 3 stone on it. 

'It is a full programme, you get nutrition advice, nice recipes and guidance and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to lose weight.' 

The television personality has previously come under fire for promoting the jab, which 'regulate the glucose level in your blood, allowing your body to use your stored fat for energy'.

This means that you can safely consume small portions without experiencing the undesired effects of starvation mode.  

Gemma continued: 'My advice to anyone looking to start a weight loss journey would be adopt the right mindset.

Earlier this month, Gemma furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her as she was 'too fat'.

Talking about TOWIE's 10th anniversary, she said: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body.  

'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.

'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand.

'So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?' 

Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.
