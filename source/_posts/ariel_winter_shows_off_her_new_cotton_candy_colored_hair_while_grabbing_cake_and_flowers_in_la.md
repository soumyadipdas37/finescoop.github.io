Ariel Winter jumped from 11 seasons of the smash sitcom Modern Family into an indie thriller film Don't Log Off that just wrapped production in late July. 

The 22-year-old actress who has been laying low since then, was seen changing up her hair color as she stepped out in Los Angeles. 

The now cotton candy haired beauty who had been rocking a platinum do since July, was seen Wednesday with a fresh look as she picked up flowers and a cake.

For her outing Ariel wore a pair of denim jean shorts and a ruffled off the shoulder top putting her petite figure on display. 

She kept her footwear comfortable and casual as she slipped on a pair of white vans for her day of errands.

The actress wore her newly dyed locks down and made sure to keep herself protected as she sported a black face mask as she walked to her car juggling all her purchases.  

It is unclear where Miss Winter was heading with her celebratory goodies but the actress made sure to not show up empty handed.

 Since the pandemic Ariel has been spending a lot of quality time with her beau of nearly nine months, Luke Benward, 24.

Winter had been tied to longtime boyfriend Levi Meaden, 32, since November of 2016 before the couple ended things in Fall 2019 after three years together. 

The young talent started dating the Dumplin' actor a few months after her breakup as the two were first spotted out grabbing dinner in December 2019.

Their relationship seems to be going from strength to strength as just last week the couple enjoyed a romantic staycation in Laguna Beach.

The couple have been spending a lot of time together cohabitating during lockdown and even wrapped a joint venture together. 

They both star in the thriller project Don't Log Off which was Ariel's project since wrapping Modern Family in April.

The new age indie film is set entirely during COVID times and was shot both virtually and on location. No release date has been set though the film has likely begun post production.
