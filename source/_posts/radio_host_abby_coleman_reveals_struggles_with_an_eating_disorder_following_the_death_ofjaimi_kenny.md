Abby said on air: 'My heart breaks to know someone lost their life through that because there would have been a lot of girls in the clinic that I've gone to over the years that just never come out'. 

The former star of reality show The Mole went on to detail her own struggles. 

'I didn't think I'd be here and to be honest, able to eat in a relaxed fashion. I never thought I'd be able to eat something that was on a banned list.

The former star of The Mole went on to detail her own struggles: 'I didn't think I'd be here and to be honest, able to eat in a relaxed fashion. I never thought I'd be able to eat something that was on a banned list' she said 

'I always had issues with it. I was always focused on being thin. I did ballet. I had that pressure growing up and pressure on myself,' she said.  

Abby added that at her worst, she weighed just 36 kilos and was using amphetamines to keep her weight down.   

She said: 'Once I had banned food, I forced myself to throw up and that was a cycle. That was a secret weapon. Then that would be the only food I would consume. I got down to 36kg. My periods had stopped. I had hair on my arms. 

'I had sores on my knuckles from throwing up so much. I would have been maybe around about 19.'

Struggle: She added that at her worst, she was using amphetamines to keep her weight down. 'I got down to 36kg. My periods had stopped. I had hair on my arms. I had sores on my knuckles from throwing up so much,' she admitted 

Abby added: 'I remember going to a clinic and I was so devastated because I wasn't the thinnest. Isn't that crazy? I would take amphetamines to get it down. Everything was just so consuming of it.'

The radio star credits therapy, reaching out to the Butterfly Foundation and meeting her husband Scott with aiding her recovery.  

She promised other sufferers there was hope, professing: 'I want people to know that you can get better. You can honestly find peace with food, and your body and your weight. You can honestly love it'.
