The gunman who shot dead a Metropolitan Police custody sergeant in the early hours of today was allegedly having his temperature checked at the time as part of new booking rules amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The detained man was said to have been about to be assessed and have his temperature and details taken after arriving at Croydon custody centre in South London following his arrest on suspicion of possessing ammunition.

He shot the unnamed officer at about 2.15am this morning. Officers and paramedics then treated the officer - who was said to have been nearing retirement - at the scene before he was taken to hospital where he later died. 

The arrested man - who is still alive in hospital despite turning the gun on himself - had been arrested by a special constable with a normal officer on patrol after he was seen behaving strangely. They searched him and allegedly found ammunition on him, before handcuffing him and driving him in a patrol car to the custody centre.

The custody sergeant is the tenth police officer to have been killed in the line of duty in the past decade, with the last being Andrew Harper in Berkshire in August 2019. PC Harper's widow Lissie Harper said on Facebook that it was 'utterly devastating', adding: 'What is happening to our world?'

Today's incident marks the first time a UK police officer has been shot dead on duty since September 2012 when Dale Cregan killed PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone.

Detectives said a 23-year-old man was arrested by officers at the scene and taken to hospital with a gunshot wound, where he remains in a critical condition.  

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: 'My deepest condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues of the police officer who was killed in Croydon last night. We owe a huge debt to those who risk their own lives to keep us safe.'

Scotland Yard said no police firearms were discharged, and they were informing the officer's relatives and supporting them with specialist officers.

A number of policing colleagues changed their social media profile pictures to black, with a blue line, as a mark of respect to the officer.

Met Police officer Stuart James tweeted: 'This morning my team and I responded to the worst possible radio transmission from custody, words and scenes I shall never forget.

'The unimaginable happened to our police family. We have lost not only a good skipper but also a real gentleman. One of the best. RIP brother.'

Community police officer Jacqueline Kufuor burst into tears after laying flowers outside the centre in tribute to her colleague. She said that the deceased officer was 'a lovely guy' and 'the nicest man I have ever met'.

She said: 'You never expect this to happen when you go to work. For him to have been in custody and for this to have happened, it is just so sad.'

She said: 'He was a very lovely man. He was such a nice man. When he sees you, he would just stand and talk to you. He would ask you about your job and how your are coping and how you are doing out there. So when I ever had issues, I would just talk to him.'

Neil John-Baptiste, 44, a recovery driver of Thornton Heath in south London, drove down to the centre to lay flowers. He said: 'I just think that a police officer has lost his life in the course of doing his duty.

'I think it is really disheartening what happened here today. These are just flowers but it is a mark of respect. Things have got to change.'

Commissioner Cressida Dick said: 'This is a truly shocking incident in which one of our colleagues has lost his life in the most tragic circumstances. My heart goes out to his family, direct colleagues and friends.

'We are currently supporting his family and also have a dedicated team providing support to the officers and those in the custody centre who witnessed the shooting.'

'When a colleague dies in the line of duty the shockwaves and sadness reverberates throughout the Met and our communities.

'Policing is a family, within London and nationally, and we will all deeply mourn our colleague.

Home Secretary Priti Patel (pictured in London on Tuesday) said she was 'deeply shocked and saddened' by the shooting

'We are in the early stages of the investigation and are still working to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident and we will provide further updates when we have them.'

Scotland Yard said it had referred the incident to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) which will lead an independent investigation. 

Speaking at the Home Office, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'I'm deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic killing of the officer in Croydon overnight.

'All our thoughts are with the officer's family, friends and colleagues across the Metropolitan Police force, but also policing family across the country.

'This is a sad day for our country as once again we see the tragic killing of a police officer in the line of duty as they're trying to protect us and keep us safe.

'Later on today I'll be meeting with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner to discuss the investigation that is currently taking place, and of course the Metropolitan Police Service now need the time and the space to get on with the inquiry that now needs to follow.'

Leroy Logan, a former Metropolitan Police superintendent, said there were a number of questions to be answered around the circumstances which led to the shooting of an officer at a police station.

He told BBC News: 'The first thing you want to know is how did this happen?

'How did that person come to be in the station whether it's in the yard or the building itself and be able to produce a weapon, whether it's on them at the time.

'It depends on the calibre of the weapon, because obviously if it's a small weapon and it can be easily in that person's clothing, then obviously it brings another question on how thoroughly that person was searched, if at all.

'Those are the things the department for professional standards will look at and the Independent Office for Police Conduct as well as the investigating officers who will have to look at this thing thoroughly.

'Because there's a lot of learning and obviously there's a lot of pain for the family and friends and colleagues of that officer who has fallen in the line of duty.'

Speaking to BBC News, former Metropolitan Police superintendent Mr Logan said the procedure followed will depend on the circumstances in which police came into contact with a suspect.

He said: 'It depends if that person was arrested outside the police station and has been transported in a vehicle. Invariably these officers will search that individual to make sure they haven't got anything that can harm other people or themselves.

Police are investigating the incident after a custody sergeant was shot in the early hours

'Or try and hide any material whether it's drugs or any sort of articles that they shouldn't have.

The custody sergeant is the tenth police officer to have been killed in the line of duty in the past decade. The other nine are as follows:

'That's standard procedure and of course that's for security reasons just in case they have got a weapon.

'There are circumstances where someone might turn up at the custody suite area itself in the reception and are led straight through.

'So not knowing all of the details, how this person got into the secure area of the station, whether it's outside the building or in the yard or whatever, we just need to try and find out what's happened because the details are very, very scant.'

Former Metropolian Police officer Dal Babu told LBC Radio: 'A full body search, you'd expect that to take place at the time of the arrest.

'The once they're in the police station you might do a more thorough search, the custody officer may authorise a strip search, and that's when you may find other weapons on individuals.

'For safety purposes officers are advised to carry out the search at the time of the arrest.

'Officers are having to travel some significant distances to take prisoners to custody suites.'

Steve Reed, Labour MP for Croydon North, said his thoughts were with the officer's family and colleagues.

He tweeted: 'All of us in Croydon are in shock at this heartbreaking tragic news.'

Mr Reed, 46, left a floral tribute at the scene with party chair Mohammed Islam, 46.

Mr Islam was 'deeply touched' by the incident as his son Shakz, 23, is waiting for his start date to become a police officer covering Westminster, Fulham and Chelsea.

He said: 'This is why I am really really touched by what has happened. It's very shocking and devastating news as I never thought something to this extent could happen in this day and age.

'I really feel for the family. The bravery the emergency services show in protecting us is incredible. I know that my son will also show this courage and not be deterred by this awful event.'

His son Shakz Islam, 23, said: 'When I heard an officer had been shot dead, I was absolutely shocked. My brother kept calling me to tell me someone had been killed a custody officer.

'It's absolutely appalling but does not put me off wanting to become an officer. If anything it makes me want to protect the public more and shows the career is worthwhile.'

Special constables are volunteer police officers who work with and support their local force.

They spend an average of four hours a week supporting detectives and after completing training have the same powers as regular officers, unlike PCSOs or police support volunteers.

This therefore means a special constable is entitled to arrest someone in exactly the same way as a normal officer.

Their main role is carry out local intelligence-based patrols and to take part in crime prevention initiatives in problem areas.

Among their duties they conduct foot patrols; assist at the scene of accidents; carry out house-to-house enquiries; provide security at major events and tackle anti-social behaviour.

They are not paid but do receive expenses, and are recruited locally by all 43 Home Office police forces in England and Wales.

Brother Zak Islam, 20, added: 'It's just such a surprise that it's happened here. A custody station like this is supposed to keep people safe.

'I just don't get how the gun wasn't found during a search before he was taken into the building. It may have prevented it from happening. I've grown up here my whole life and like living here.

'It is a bit rough but crime seems to have seriously dropped since the police station was built around five years ago.'

Recovery driver Neil Garcia, 44, heard a helicopter circling overhead after he returned from work shortly after 1am. He added to the bunches of flowers left outside the custody centre.

Mr Garcia said: 'It's not a surprise to hear a helicopter round here late at night but I saw the devastating news this morning. I thought it was only right to lay flowers today because a human being has lost their life at the end of the day.

'There might be a lot of tension between young people and the police around here but it's the same with many communities.

'While I don't know this officer, I know a lot of good people in the police who helped me turn my life around when I was younger so this has touched my heart.

'These people are just doing their job out of love for the communities they serve and there's no way something like this should happen to them.'

Meanwhile Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: 'Horrific to hear of a police officer being shot and killed in Croydon. 

'Our police put themselves in harm's way every day to keep us safe. All my thoughts are with the officer's family, friends and colleagues.' 

London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted: 'Devastated by this news. My heart goes out to the family of this brave officer, who has paid the ultimate price for helping to keep Londoners safe.

'Tragic incidents like this are terrible reminders of the dangers our police officers face every single day.'

Justice Secretary Robert Buckland tweeted he was 'shocked and saddened' by the news.

He said: 'My thoughts are with the officer's loved ones, colleagues and the wider police community.'

A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 2.16am this morning to reports of an incident on Windmill Lane, Croydon.

'We sent two ambulance crews, an incident response officer, an advanced paramedic and two medics in cars. We also dispatched a London's Air Ambulance trauma team. 

'The first of our medics were at the scene in under four minutes. We treated two people at the scene and took them both by road to a major trauma centre.'

Maria Tripi, who lives opposite the police station, said she was woken by the noise of ambulances. The 66-year-old said: 'I was woken up at around 2.20am.

'I saw the blue lights in my room so I looked out and saw three ambulances, one was inside and two were outside.

'Then there was a lot more police vehicles and they were all rushing very quickly along the road. Then later I saw the forensic officers wearing all white.

'Then when I saw the news in the morning I couldn't believe it. It's a police station, I never thought that could happen there.

'I was so surprised because when I heard I was worried it could be terrorism or something like that because it's so terrible.

'It's very scary because there was so many police. I was scared for the police inside. I live near a police station, normally I feel safe here.

'I think the police need more support from the Government for more help and equipment because crime is so terrible in Croydon, its very bad.'

Policing minister Kit Malthouse updated MPs about the officer's death, adding: 'May justice follow this heinous crime.'

Raising a point of order in the House of Commons, Mr Malthouse said: 'We ask our police officers to do an extraordinary job.

'The fact that one of them has fallen in the line of performing that duty is a tragedy for the entire nation.

'I know the entire House will offer their condolences to his family and friends and colleagues. May he rest in peace and may justice follow this heinous crime.'

Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle added: 'It is shocking news. This should never happen to the people that protect us and make us safe. 

'All our thoughts and prayers go with the family and friends and the police community.'

Croydon Central MP and shadow policing minister Sarah Jones told Times Radio: 'It's absolutely devastating.

'I just feel so sorry for the family of the officer who has been shot dead and so sorry for the community of our police in Croydon who are obviously a family of people who work together every day, who put themselves out in danger every day, drive into danger and are a really close family and they are going to be absolutely devastated and I'm just so sorry.

'Of course there are going to be questions asked about what happened... and we'll get to the bottom of what happened and why. 

'But today, it's an absolute tragedy and not something you ever think is going to happen.'

Reverend Catherine Tucker, of Holy Saviour Church whose parish covers the custody centre, said: 'I am sad for both the death of the police officer but also the perpetrator.

'We are conscious of tensions between young people and police in this area over the past few years and we are actually running a project to try and improve those relationships.

'Unfortunately I am not really surprised that something like this has happened in Croydon.

'This is a highly and richly diverse area with very strong community links but it's one of the most highly deprived areas in terms of poverty rate in the whole country.'

Admin assistant Wilhelmina Jew, 45, who lives nearby, said: 'I only saw all the activity outside the police station so when I saw it on the news, I realised that must be it.

'It is completely unacceptable for anyone to kill a police officer because they are they are the last line of support for the community.

'Sometimes I really wish we lived in a country village because sadly this sort of thing happens all too often.'

The shadow justice secretary, Labour's David Lammy, tweeted: 'Appalling news that a police officer has been shot dead in Croydon.

'It is tragic when an officer loses their life in the line of duty while doing their job keeping the public safe. My thoughts and condolences are with the officer's family, colleagues and friends.'

Yvette Cooper, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: 'It is truly awful news that a brave police officer has been killed.

'My thoughts and deep sympathies go out to the family, friends and colleagues of this brave officer - and also to everyone in policing who will be feeling this loss deeply.

'Every day our police put themselves in harm's way to keep us all safe - it is devastating for this to happen to someone working to protect others'.

National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt said: 'This is a truly terrible incident and my thoughts and condolences go out to the officer, his family, friends and colleagues at what is a deeply distressing time.

'It is another tragic reminder of the risks police officers take on a daily basis to keep the public safe.

'Policing is a family and I join my colleagues across the country in mourning the senseless death of one of our own in the line of duty.'

Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: 'The murder of a colleague on duty is utterly devastating news. Officers across London are in shock and sick to their stomachs at the nature of his death.

'All our thoughts - and that of all our members - are with his family, friends and close colleagues at this time. We and all members of the police family across the country are all utterly heartbroken at this news.'

He added: 'Officers put themselves in danger every day to protect the public. Sadly, on very rare occasions officers make the ultimate sacrifice whilst fulfilling their role. When that happens we will ensure their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten.

'Colleagues involved in the incident will have our full support for as long as is needed.'

Home Secretary Priti Patel released the above statement following the sergeant's death

IOPC regional director Sal Naseem said: 'Our deepest sympathies go out to all those affected by this terrible event. 

'We were notified by the MPS of the shooting incident at Croydon Custody Centre early this morning. 

'We understand a police officer has since sadly died and a man is in a critical condition in hospital. 

'A murder investigation by the force is under way. Our investigators are at the scene and police post incident procedure to begin our independent enquiries.'

Croydon Police had tweeted last night that they had an 'uplift in officers helping you keep safe tonight regarding Covid compliance rules'.

The police officer who has died after being shot in Croydon joins a long list of colleagues killed in the line of duty.

A National Police Memorial roll of honour in London lists all the officers who have been killed by criminal acts in the line of duty since 1680.

The roll records more than 1,600 officers who have died while performing vital tasks such as foiling terrorists, quelling rioters and marshalling protests.

Among them was Pc Andrew Harper, who died when he was caught in a tow rope and dragged along country lanes after trying to stop quad bike thieves in Berkshire in August 2019.

His three teenage killers were cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter after an Old Bailey trial.

The roll of honour also includes unarmed Pc Keith Palmer, who was stabbed in March 2017 by Khalid Masood during the Westminster Bridge terror attack.

Masood's rampage, in which five people died, was ended when he was shot dead by a minister's close protection officer.

Pc Palmer was posthumously awarded the George Medal.

Also listed are the three unarmed Metropolitan Police officers murdered in Shepherd's Bush by Harry Roberts in 1966.

Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, and Pc Geoffrey Fox, 41, were shot without warning while questioning three suspects in a van.

In more recent times, Pc Gary Toms, 37, was critically injured confronting suspects in Leyton, east London, on April 11 2009.

He died six days later when his life support machine was switched off, 25 years to the day after Pc Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead outside the Libyan embassy in London while controlling a crowd of demonstrators.

Pc Fiona Bone, 32, and Pc Nicola Hughes, 23, were murdered by Dale Cregan in Greater Manchester in September 2012.

Pc Ricky Gray was shot in the head by a gunman who then turned the weapon on himself in Shrewsbury in 2007, and Pc Sharon Beshenivsky was shot dead when she and a colleague tried to stop armed robbers in Bradford in November 2005.

Another name on the roll is Pc Keith Blakelock, a 40-year-old father of three who was set on by a mob and hacked to death with a machete during the Broadwater Farm riots in 1985.

Winston Silcott, along with two other men, was found guilty of his murder but in 1991 their convictions were overturned on appeal because of 'unsafe' police evidence.

Det Con Oake's bravery not only saved the lives of several colleagues but potentially hundreds of people who Bourgass was plotting to kill with the poison ricin.

Pc Alison Armitage, 29, was run down by a stolen car in March 2001.

She died during an undercover operation in Hollinwood, near Oldham, Greater Manchester.

She was run over twice by a driver in a stolen vehicle in the car park of a derelict pub.

In October 1997, Pc Nina Mackay was stabbed to death in a raid in Stratford, east London, by paranoid schizophrenic Magdi Elgizouli.

Police officers also find themselves in danger when they are off duty.
