Ali Larter cut a youthful figure while in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday. 

As the Varsity Blues actress walked through town she wore a backwards baseball cap, skinny jeans and yellow Scooby-Doo T-shirt. 

The 44-year-old star also had on a pair of classic Ray-Ban sunglasses as she clutched a CDC-recommended face mask.

The Heroes star, who shares her daughter Vivienne, five, and son Theodore, nine, with husband Hayes MacArthur, chose a family-friendly top, which featured the cartoon characters Scooby-Doo and Shaggy.    

Over the weekend, Larter opened up about getting 'all ready to venture out' of her home in a form-fitting minidress and her blonde tresses styled in loose waves.  

In a very glamorous shot, the Dawson's Creek alum looked absolutely stunning in her denim frock, which hugged every inch of her toned figure.

Her lengthy caption gave her more than 453,000 Instagram followers a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes reality of trying to get ready and care for two children. 

'It was so lovely to pull myself together again!' Larter exclaimed, before revealing that her little girl is 'always stealing her brushes.'   

In addition to showcasing her impressive baking skills on social media, the mother-of-two has been actively documenting her recent adventures.

Just last month, she shared snaps of herself and family hiking around Acadia National Park on Maine's Mount Desert Island. 

'Hitting the highest point on the East Coast! In our family it’s not always easy to get motivated for a hike, but once we are in those trees, conquering those mountains, the complaints turn into awe,' captioned a photo of herself, MacArthur and their youngsters.

She joked: 'Unless, I forgot the snacks and then I’m back in the doghouse!'

Upon her return to Los Angeles, the Legally Blonde standout enjoyed a trip to her 'hardworking and talented' hairdresser, who she has worked with for more than two decades. 

'An actual blow out and a glass of wine! What?!!!!!! Sorry, but the blonder the better for this Jersey girl,' she captioned a stunning selfie, earlier this month.  

Larter also spoke about watching the 'heartbreaking' news of the fires ravaging in California and making pumpkin bread from scratch.
