This is the hilarious moment an autistic comedian brings the house down with his sketch about his non-autistic brother. 

Joe Wells performed the routine at the Top Secret Comedy Club in London where he spoke about all the traits of his 'severely not autistic' sibling.  

He joked with the crowd about his own diagnosis with autism, saying: 'I am properly diagnosed and everything. So if you heckle me, technically that is a hate crime'.

'He loves making eye contact. He's really into loud, sudden noises. Sh*t at maths.'

He then joked that 'wasn't fair' on non-autistic people, and that they could also be good at maths, adding: 'with the right support you can achieve anything'.
