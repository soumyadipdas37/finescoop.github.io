She announced last week that she was separating from her second husband Ant Anstead.

Now Christina Anstead has opened up to her 1.4 million Instagram followers in a personal post addressing her life post-separation.

The 37-year-old Flip Or Flop star acknowledged on Saturday morning that she 'never thought I would have 2 baby daddies,' but conceded that 'sometimes life throws us curve balls.'

Surprising path: Christina Anstead opened up on Saturday about her life after after separating from Ant Anstead, in which she said she 'never thought I would have 2 baby daddies'

Christina opened her lengthy post by reintroducing herself to her followers.

'For those of you who don’t know me (or think you know me) let me reintroduce myself. I hate crowds, I love traveling, all things spiritual, the ocean and deep one on one conversations,' she wrote.

But the subject quickly turned to her early days in real estate, though she admitted she originally wanted to be a sports agent 'like Jerry Maguire.' 

'But I always loved looking at houses with my parents especially model homes and I always wanted to be my own boss...' she continued, adding that she got her real estate license at a community college.

'I got started in real estate at 21 which led to selling houses which led to flipping houses which led to Tv.'

Public life: Despite being a star of Flip Or Flop, Christina said she never wanted to be on TV, though she was 'grateful for the life it's provided'; shown with Ant in December 2019

The reality star clarified that she 'never wanted to be on tv,' but 'stepping out of my comfort zone and into the unknown has always been my thing.'

'I live in a state of anxiousness and I’m so used to it that when it’s not there I tend to feel a void and hop into something that causes the feeling I’m used to. This can be good and bad. And it’s one of the things I’m working on breaking the pattern of,' she explained.

'Sometimes anxiety and pursuit of new dreams leads me down amazing paths, other times it leaves me feeling lost and in a state of fight or flight / or crying in my closet. Tv changed my life and I am grateful for the life it’s provided, the experiences, the friends I’ve made along the way.'

Unexpected: 'I never thought I would have one divorce let alone two. I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies — but sometimes life throws us curve balls,' she wrote

Christina emphasized that she couldn't have predicted the paths her life would take.

'I never thought I would have one divorce let alone two. I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies — but sometimes life throws us curve balls,' she wrote, adding that she saw these changes as 'opportunities to grow,' rather than 'setbacks.'

'While some may judge me and throw around rumors about me, most of you support me. And that says a lot about this world and where we are headed. I’m messy, I’m real and I’m working on healing. I’m surrounded by extremely powerful women who help me cope, build me up and push me to be better.'

Christina ended her post by thanking her friends for their support and said se hoped her life story could inspire others.

'We are all a work in progress,' she concluded.
