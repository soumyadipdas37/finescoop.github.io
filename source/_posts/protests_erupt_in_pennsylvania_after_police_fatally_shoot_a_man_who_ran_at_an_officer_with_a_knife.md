Bodycam video shows Ricardo Munoz, 27, pictured 'brandishing a knife over his head' in a threatening manner. He was shot dead

Crowds gathered to protest in a city in Pennsylvania on Sunday evening after a man was fatally shot by an officer who authorities say was responding to a domestic disturbance call.

The shooting, which occurred shortly after 4pm in Lancaster, killed 27-year-old Ricardo Munoz, the Lancaster County District Attorney's Office said, whose office will lead an investigation into the incident. 

The officer's body camera footage showed Munoz emerging from the inside of the house and running towards the officer when he arrived at the residence as part of the call.

Munoz could be seen brandishing a knife above his head 'in clear view' and 'in a threatening manner' when the officer fired at him.

Munoz fell to the ground and died at the scene a short time later

Munoz died at the scene and no one else was struck by gunfire.

'A police-involved shooting has significant impact on a community, as we are seeing with the large number of individuals gathering in the streets,' District Attorney Heather Adams said. 'However, I am asking that all reaction be tempered as the investigation is ongoing.'

WGAL-TV reported the windows of police vehicles were smashed during a protest against the shooting later on Sunday night.

The crowds also marched to the city's police station to continue their protests and could be heard chanting 'this is what democracy looks like.'

Police Chief Jarrad Berkihiser held a brief news conference on Sunday but shared very few details of the shooting. He said that people could remain near the crime scene, but urged them to stay calm and peaceful. 

A 'final determination on the use of force' will be made by District Attorney Adams.

'We ask that acts of protest remain peaceful as violence and destruction of property will become headlines and serve no purpose for the safety and wellbeing of our citizens and neighborhoods,' the DA's office requested.

Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace also released a statement,'This has been a heartbreaking day for our city. I grieve for the loss of life and know that there are more questions to be answered as the investigation continues.'
