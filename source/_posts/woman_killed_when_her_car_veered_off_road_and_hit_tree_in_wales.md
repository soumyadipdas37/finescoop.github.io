Ms Nicholas's distraught young family paid tribute to the 'beautiful' mother and have launched a crowdfunding page to pay for the funeral.

Her brother Scott said some money would be set aside for Mia, who will now live with her father, so 'her life can maybe be made just that little bit brighter'.

He said: 'As many of you are painfully and already aware, on August 29, at approximately 3.45am, our baby sister Rhianne sadly lost her life in a road traffic accident.

'To many of you she was a friend, to us she is forever a sister and a mother who would constantly try to make you laugh and smile no matter how dark your day and a person who would always put others first even when the world was falling apart around her.

'We appreciate the messages that so many of you have sent us with your condolences and we all apologise for not being able to respond to each and every one of you - but simply doing that would mean we would have to face the reality that is happening around us.'

Cousin Alanis Davies, said: 'I'm still in complete shock and lost for words that this has happened to my beautiful cousin Rhianne Nicholas. Life is so precious and hers has been taken short.

'She was such a loving and strong person, I know she will be watching over Mia. Heaven has gained another angel; rest in peace beautiful girl.'

South Wales Police is continuing to appeal for information over Saturday morning's crash.

A force spokesman said: 'We would like to speak with any witnesses to the collision, any person who may have dash-camera footage of the incident, or anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of the Vauxhall Adam prior to the collision.'
