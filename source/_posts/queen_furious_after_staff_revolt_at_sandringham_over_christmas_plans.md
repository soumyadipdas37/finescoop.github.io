The Queen is said to be 'furious' after Royal Household staff revolted against a plan for them to stay in a Covid bubble at Sandringham over Christmas. 

The 20 or so employees had been asked to remain on the monarch's Norfolk estate without their families to support her, Prince Philip and other members of the Royal Family during the festive period.

But the group are believed to have mutinied because they are unwilling to isolate from loved ones for four weeks.
