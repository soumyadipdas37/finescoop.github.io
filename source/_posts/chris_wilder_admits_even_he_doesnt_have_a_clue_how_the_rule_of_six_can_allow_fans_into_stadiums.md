Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder has conceded he is bemused by the decision to have 10 matches welcoming 1,000 fans each this weekend.Â 

The English Football League announced on Wednesday that 10 teams, including three in the second-tier Championship at Norwich, Middlesbrough and Luton, have permission to host pilot events for the return of supporters.

Wilder, speaking ahead of the Blades' clash against Burnley in the Carabao Cup on Thursday, has admitted even he 'doesn't have a clue' how the nationwide Rule of Six can allow spectators back into stadiums.

'I just don't where we are with it all, I've got to say. I haven't got a clue,' he said in his pre-match press conference.

'Am I allowed to see my nan? Am I allowed to see my mum? But then we can have 1,000 people in a ground but then we can't have 15,000 and then I can't go and have a pint with my mates unless there's only six of us.Â 

'So I've got to say I'm like the majority of people in this country have not got a clue what's going off... haven't got a clue.

'If anybody can help me. I'll try and affect that game of football and with the staff and boys in getting a result but everything else, all that other stuff, I ain't got a clue.'Â Â 

Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium will welcome crowds for the first time since March

Three Championship matches -Â Luton Town vs Derby County at Kenilworth Road, Norwich City vs Preston North End at Carrow Road and Middlesbrough vs Bournemouth at the Riverside Stadium - will host fans for the first time since March at the weekend.Â 

The League One matches at Charlton, Blackpool, Shrewsbury Town and Hull City, as well as the games at Forest Green Rovers, Carlisle United and Morecambe in League Two have also been chosen for the test events.Â 

The venues have been chosen because they are not located in areas subject to coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Cambridge welcomed 862 fans, who were required to socially distance in the stands, last week.
