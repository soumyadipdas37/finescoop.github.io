A member of the This Morning crew mistook a sex doll for Holly Willoughby on Tuesday.

The presenter, 39, joked about the mishap with her co-host Phillip Schofield, 58, after interviewing a woman who has a sex doll business.

'A member of the crew, I won’t say who it was, came in this morning and thought it was me sat on the sofa! Shocking!' Holly exclaimed.

My Holly, you've changed: A member of the This Morning crew mistook a sex doll for Holly Willoughby on Tuesday

To which Phil added. jokingly: 'They did and they said, my God did you have a rough night out last night?'

Referring to the doll, Holly asked Phil: 'Have you replaced me already? You’ve upgraded me for a better model!'

Phil was seen laughing with the giant Barbie-like doll, who sat between them on the couch.

The figure was life-sized, blonde and wearing a kimono-style dress. 

Not amused: 'A member of the crew, I won’t say who it was, came in this morning and thought it was me sat on the sofa! Shocking!' Holly exclaimed 

The interview with the doll woman caused its usual titters among the presenting pair, who grilled her on where one stores a sex toy of such size.

'Where do you put them?' Phil asked. 'Next to the hoover under the stairs?' Holly suggested.

'We have storage boxes,' the lady replied.

'Where do you put that? Where does the storage go?' Phil pushed. 

Phil added. jokingly: 'They did and they said, my God did you have a rough night out last night?'

'You can put things on top of the boxes. A lot of people put them in their shower with them!' she replied.

Grimacing at that, Holly added: 'Imagine how freaked out you’d be if you went to that persons houses.'
