The Strictly Come Dancing female professional dancers are reported to be battling it out to be part of the show's first same-sex pairing with Nicola Adams.

The dancers are said to be super keen to be partnered with the boxer, 37, who requested a female partner when she joined the show.

Katya Jones, 31, is said to be a front-runner for the coupling, while Oti Mabuse, 37,  Karen Hauer, 38, and Janette Manrara, 36, have also expressed an interest in dancing with Nicola.

A source told The Sun: 'The female pros know that forming Strictly’s first same-sex partnership will thrust them into the spotlight like never before.

'But they’re also thrilled by the fact Nicola is a sportswoman, because she has the discipline and fitness to deliver a sensational performance.'

They added that the Olympian will have the 'strength' to do the lifts in the performances, while her 'sensational physique' will make routines that much 'sexier'. 

The insider added: 'The fact the pros are jostling to be with Nicola is a fantastic sign of progress. When Strictly started in less accepting times 16 years ago, they may have had to give it more careful consideration.'

MailOnline have contacted representatives of Strictly for comment. 

It comes after pro Katya Jones is reportedly hoping to be paired with boxer Nicola after admitting she would 'love' to be apart of the first same-sex pairing.

The beauty is said to be a 'huge believer in girl power' and is 'telling everyone' how much she wants to be paired with the Olympic gold medallist. 

Katya is also apparently still keen to redeem herself after she was caught kissing her dance partner Seann Walsh, 34, in 2018.

Shockwaves were sent through the Strictly dance floor when married Katya was pictured locking lips with her comedian partner during a pub trip.

A source told The Sun: 'She sees it as a chance to make history but also to redeem herself on the show after her scandal two years ago.

'She's a real girls' girl and is keen to move on from that.'

They continued: 'Equally, show bosses know that Katya will have everyone talking about her and Nicola if they partner them together.'

Katya is said to be 'one of the most competitive dancers' and is keen to 'push the boundaries' on the dancefloor, according to the source. 

Producers decide the celebrity and professional pairings based on height, according to The Sun. 

Katya measures at 5ft 5ins while former professional boxer Nicola stands at 5ft 4ins. 

It was announced this week that Nicola is set to be in the first same-sex pairing on the BBC show, as she said in a statement: 'It's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.'

Speaking live from her home on BBC Breakfast, Nicola said of her groundbreaking all-female pairing: 'It's really important, it's a big step for the show as well. It's nice to see we've been able to move on and I just can't wait to get some dancing done really.' 

Revealing she approached Strictly with the idea for a same-sex pairing, Nicola explained: 'I asked the show about it. They wanted to know if I wanted to be on the show and I said "yeah I'll do it but I want to dance with another female dance partner.'"

'It's definitely a time for change and time to move on and be more diverse. This is a brilliant step in the right direction. It will be nice for the LGBT community to be able to see that there are same sex couples on the show as well.'
