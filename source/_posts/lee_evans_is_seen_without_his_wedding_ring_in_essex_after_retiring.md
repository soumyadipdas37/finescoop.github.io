Lee Evans was seen going for a run in Essex this week without his wedding ring, four years after removing himself from the spotlight to spend time with his wife.

The comedian, 56, announced his retirement from stand-up comedy in 2014, citing a desire to spend more time with his wife Heather Nudds and their daughter Mollie.   

The couple tied the knot in 1984 and kept their relationship out of the public eye throughout Lee's comedy career.  

During his run in his native county, Lee was seen without the jewellery as he donned bright exercise gear and stopped for an animated chat with a pal.

On his run, the star sported a bright orange top and a pair of navy tracksuit bottoms with a matching cap. The Medallion star also sported a pair of navy trainers and completed his look with a pair of sunglasses. 

Lee appeared in good spirits on the outing as he chatted to a friend who passed him by while he was out for a run.

The outing marks the first time Lee has been seen in public for quite some time. The comedian briefly came out of retirement in 2018 to appear in the play Pinter Three while he appeared in the play Wither Would You Go? the year before.

Also in 2017, he walked the red carpet at the film premiere of the movie Kenny in Liverpool, however this is what his time in the spotlight has been limited to.

Ring: Lee, who quit comedy in 2014 to spend more time with his family, was spotted without his wedding ring 

Lee confirmed his retirement from stand-up comedy during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show in 2014. 

On the show, he told Jonathan  that the death of his manager, Addison Cresswell, had 'put things in perspective'.    

He said: 'I don't know, I've come to a junction in my life where - please forgive me it sounds very narcissistic - I've done musicals and plays and films and stand up and you sort of get to a point where you go "I don't know what else to do next".'

He added: 'I want to go and see my wife, she deserves my time, I've been working solidly.'

Ross asked how long the planned to carry on in his job, to which he replied: 'I am knackered. This is it. Finished. This is the end. I am not doing anything.'

Fancy seeing you here! He was chatting away during the outing

Lee added another reason for his departure was the death of his manager Addison Creswell, who died after suffering a heart attack last year.

'All I have ever done is work and Addison always used to put his arm around me and say, "Don't worry, I will look after you. It is okay",' he said.

'My dad always said to me, "You have got to work" so I constantly worked and did comedy tours. I think I have ignored for far too long my missus, and I want to spend a lot more time with her.'

Chatting away: He fondly greeted the passerby
