She's one of Australia's most beloved comedians and TV personalities. 

And the 52-year-old recently made an appearance on the hit singing show, The Masked Singer Australia. 

In addition to her stellar career, she is also a mother-of-two - but would you recognise her from this throwback photo taken when she was playing tennis as a kid? 

Guess who! This Australian TV host and comedian is a household name - but would you recognise her from this throwback taken when she was playing tennis as a kid?

In the picture, she is sporting a hot pink jumpsuit with white sneakers and a matching white visor. 

Her hair was worn loose in a shoulder length bob - which isn't dissimilar to today - and she was toting a 'John Newcombe tennis racket'.

The young teen in the photo is none other than I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! host, Julia Morris.

'1979... I had a John Newcombe tennis racket,' she captioned the picture. 

'It made me feel like a number 1 seed. (C division, 7.30am Sunday mornings at the courts behind Gosford Hospital...'

After her unveiling, Julia said she loved singing and performing on stage again after so much television work.

'It's been so exciting. As a comedian, you don't want anyone to think you're taking yourself too seriously.

'Being behind the mask, I was allowed to have my turn at being a singer, and that was so thrilling and it just filled me up in a great way. I've had such a wonderful experience,' she said.
