Jadon Sancho has given his verdict on the five most skilful players he has ever played with – and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford is top of the list.

The Borussia Dortmund star chose to name the United forward and his England teammate, just as the Red Devils make a final push to sign the talented winger before the October 5 transfer deadline.

Only this week, United reportedly lined up a final take-it-or-leave-it £90million offer for a player they have been trying to sign all summer.

Sancho, 20, who joined the Bundesliga club in August 2017 from Manchester City, also named David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne in the star-studded list of the five best  'ballers' he has shared a pitch with.

Former Dortmund forward Mario Götze and the German club's current left winger Julian Brandt made up his top five.

Speaking to the Chunkz and Yung Filly YouTube channel, Sancho was asked, 'Who is the most skilful player you have played with?'

'It would have to be Neymar, he is different with it,' said Sancho initially, before he realised it was players he had played with and then focused on club and England team mates.

'Played with – Marcus Rashford,' he added.

'When I was at City Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva. It would probably be David Silva. He just dictates play.'

United have been after Sancho for months, but have been unable to reach an agreement with Borussia Dortmund, who have remained firm on their £108m asking price for a player who started his football journey on London parks before joining Watford, aged nine.

But now the Red Devils are preparing a final offer of £75m up front with a further £15m in add-ons, according to Mirror Sport.

The club made a breakthrough in talks over Sancho's wages and the agents' fees earlier this month.

However, they have so far been unable to bring down the price for the England international, who has 13 caps for Gareth Southgate's side.

Dortmund's director Sebastian Kehl said earlier this week that Sancho would not be sold in a cut-price deal.
