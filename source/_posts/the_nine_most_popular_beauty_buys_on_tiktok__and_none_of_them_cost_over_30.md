Shoppers have revealed their nine favourite beauty buys in a series of Tik Tok videos.  

Rather than spending money on expensive brands, it seems many opt to choose budget beauty buys that cost no more than $30 in Australia.

Popular brands included Maybelline, L'Oreal Paris, Milk Makeup and Elf cosmetics which can often be purchased from Kmart, Target and Priceline.

Shoppers are now reviewing their favourite beauty products by sharing short videos on TikTok

E.l.f. Poreless Putty Primer ($16)

The e.l.f Poreless Putty Primer has been praised by customers for its ability to 'melt into the skin' and provide a 'smooth canvas' to apply makeup onto.

A TikTok user by the name of Teacups N Tulips shared a video on August 14 and highly recommended the product to others.

'Have you tried this primer?' she said in the caption and called it a 'beauty essential' despite being priced at only $16.

According to the online product description, the product is infused with Squalane to help grip makeup for all-day wear and help protect skin from moisture loss.

Beauty blender ($30)

For the last few years shoppers have been raving about the much-loved egg-shaped Beautyblender for its ability to apply liquid foundation, powder and primer onto the skin without absorbing the product.

In 2018 up to 57 Beautyblenders sold every hour across Australia and around 500,000 sold that year.

Australian beauty blogger Chloe Morello put the $30 Beautyblender to the test against a $10 'sea sponge'.

She said the sea sponge felt 'more abrasive' and 'dry' against her skin when applying formula whereas the Beautyblender was 'softer and smooth'.

'As I pressed down the Beautyblender, it spreads over my face a lot more. It's definitely looks like it's applying smoothly,' Chloe said on YouTube.
