Channel Seven confirmed their acquisition of The Voice Australia from rival network Nine would see the show become a 'more efficient and cost-effective production'.

And now it's believed Seven's budget cuts have resulted in the axing of its international stars in favour of local musicians.

'Seven are going for local coaches only, which means no more Kelly Rowland or Boy George, or overseas celebrities Zooming in,' an industry insider told New Idea.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions, Kelly and Boy George were forced to coach half the season remotely from their home countries.

Jessica Mauboy, 31, and The Veronicas, 35, are tipped to have been considered for the new-look panel by Seven.

In Nine's recent season, The Veronicas' twins Lisa and Jessica Origliasso became guest mentors for Boy George's team. 

In 2013, Jess Mauboy also appeared as a guest mentor on the program with former coach Ricky Martin. 

The secret spy also claimed singer and actor Troye Sivan was being approached, as he would offer a 'more family friendly' option for the show's younger demographic.

The fate of local judges Guy Sebastian and Delta Goodrem are still unclear. 

Delta, 35, is the longest-serving coach on The Voice Australia, after joining the stellar line-up for its debut season in 2012.

When news broke of the 2021 shakeup, her loyal fans demanded the Born To Try singer remain on the program. 

With a large, devoted following, it's believed Seven will offer Delta a lowered salary to remain on the new panel.

Nine 'failed to renew the contract' for the 2021 season, with Seven jumping on the deal 'very quickly', it was confirmed last month.  

In a statement, Seven's CEO and managing director James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.

James already has changes in mind for the show, with less episodes and a tighter production schedule.

 

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter timeframe,' he said. 

A Channel Nine spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia at the time: 'Unfortunately due to the age of the show and declining demographic profile, The Voice had become by far the poorest financial performer on our slate.'

'We wish Seven well in their quest to revive yet another Nine show.'

Will they return? Contracts for coaches Delta (centre), Kelly Rowland and Boy George are reportedly yet to be signed. No mention has been made of Guy Sebastian (next to Kelly). Pictured on the right are co-hosts Renee Bargh and Darren McMullen

Meanwhile, Nine's hosts Darren McMullen and Renee Bargh have been axed after just one season on the talent show.

They had replaced Sonia Kruger when she left the Nine Network, but now she is employed by Seven she's taking back the hosting role. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Seven for comment.
