Hilaria Baldwin was counting her blessings on Friday as she shared an adorable snap of newborn son Eduardo.

Taking to Instagram, the 36-year-old wife of Alec Baldwin expressed her gratitude for her youngest child's safe arrival as she reflected on the heartache she suffered last year.

'You are loved Edu Pau . I’m so grateful for you and for the experience of a healthy pregnancy. The heartache I experienced last year was beyond overwhelming. I don’t think the pain of loss ever goes away, but this tiny angel sure brings light and peace into our lives after such a rocky storm.' she wrote.

The yogi fanatic then went on to thank her medical team. 

'Thank you @nyphospital and your team of amazing nurses and doctors for yet another wonderful experience, meeting my baby inside your walls. Especially now, during Covid, I felt we were safe, and well taken care of. Doina, Sheila, Stephanie, Lisa—you know'

'It is still very early … but we have learned that there is a little person inside of me,' she wrote at the time. 'The sound of this strong heart makes me so happy – especially because of the loss we experienced in the spring,'

'We also want you to know that even though we are not ok right now, we will be. We are so lucky with our four healthy babies and we will never lose sight of this.

'I’m really devastated right now...I was not expecting this when I went to my scan today,' Hilaria added.

'I don't know what else to say...I'm still in shock and don't have this all quite clear.'
