Adelaide had cause for concern after Weekend Sunrise released it's daily weather predictions over the weekend.  

Despite spring temperatures typically reaching around 20° in the South Australian capital, Seven's Weekend Sunrise reported the city would reach an unseasonable (and uninhabitable) 158° on Sunday. 

The embarrassing gaffe was first spotted by TV Tonight, which published images of the incorrect weather strip splashed on-screen at around 7.10am.

Presumably the network meant to report temperatures highs of 18° - which would have been correct. 

It's not the first time Weekend Sunrise has suffered an on-air faux pas.  

In May, Weekend Sunrise presenter Matt Doran was left confused during a live Saturday broadcast when the show suffered technical issues and failed to switch to the next segment.

Whoops! The embarrassing gaffe was first spotted by TV Tonight , which published images of the incorrect weather strip splashed on-screen at around 7.10am

Not again! In May, Weekend Sunrise host Matt Doran (pictured) was left confused after a major technical fail almost ended the show 

After Matt threw to reporter Sarah Greenhalgh in Italy, the screen suddenly switched to Sportsbet's Inside Trading show hosted by Simon Marshall. 

But the show failed to begin and showed Simon reading his scripts while dropping the F-word live on-air.  

While the footage continued playing, Sportbet analysts Julian Vallance and Ben Clifton could also be heard having a conversation.

The television segment then switched back to Sarah reporting on coronavirus cases in Italy.

'Around the world will be watching Italy closely over the coming week to see how the easing of restrictions has an impact on the infection rate,' she said.

The show immediately cut back to the newsroom and Matt said: 'Sarah Greenhalgh reporting there and let's get some more news now with Sally.'
