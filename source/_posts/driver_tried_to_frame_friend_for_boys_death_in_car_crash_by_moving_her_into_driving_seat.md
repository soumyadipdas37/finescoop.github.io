A driver high on drugs and alcohol killed a 16-year-old schoolboy in a crash, then moved his unconscious friend into the driving seat to frame her for the boy's death, a court heard. 

Kanad Basi, who had taken cocaine and ecstasy and was almost twice the drink drive limit, drove into a bend at speed, lost control and crashed into a tree in Lesmahagow, near Lanark in Scotland.

His front seat passenger Jack Frame suffered catastrophic head injuries and died at the scene. 

The 22-year-old driver then climbed into the back of the car and pushed another passenger, Ellie Plenderleith, behind the wheel.

Basi, from Pollokshields, Glasgow, who sat in the dock wearing a facemask, was told by judge Lord Mulholland: 'This is an utter tragedy for the family of the deceased who lost his life with catastrophic injuries which you were responsible for with your driving.

'If ever there was a case that showed the folly of the combination of drugs, alcohol and speed, it is this case.'

Basi admitted at the High Court in Glasgow to causing the death of Jack by driving dangerously on New Trows Road, Lesmahagow, on February 10, 2019.

Rear passengers Aiden O'Donnell and Eleanor Plenderleith suffered horrific injuries in the crash.

At the High Court in Glasgow prosecutor Jane Farquharson told the court that Basi had driven to a party in Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, in his BMW 1 series two-door coupe around 1am.

A number of the partygoers were impressed by the car and clamoured to go for a spin in it and three of them drove off with him at 2am.

Ms Farquharson said: 'As the accused approached a right hand bend, he lost control of the car. His vehicle left the carriageway, mounted the grass verge, collided with a wire fence and struck a tree in the grounds of Hallandbush Golf Club.

'Due to this impact Jack Frame was thrown forward and trapped within the front passenger side of the vehicle. His head was wedged underneath the glove box area.'

Apprentice joiner Aiden, who was 18 at the time was sitting behind Basi. He suffered a fractured skull, four facial fractures, two broken legs and a number of fractures to his left arm. He had to under surgery and learn to walk again. He has been unable to work since the accident.

Eleanor, who at the time was 19, and worked as a sandwich artist at Subway, was knocked unconscious. She had a punctured lung, lacerated liver, broken ribs and a fractured chestbone. A metal plate had to be inserted into her left upper arm.

None of the passengers was wearing a seat belt. Basi, who was wearing one, suffered a broken wrist. His DNA and blood were found on the driver's airbag.

The prosecutor added: 'Neither passenger has any recollection about the incident itself, or what happened thereafter.

'In the immediate aftermath the accused removed his seat belt and climbed into the rear of the vehicle pushing passenger Eleanor Plenderleith into the front.

'She was found unconscious with her legs in the rear seating area and her head facing down into the driver's footwell.'

The court heard that Basi used Aiden's phone to call 999 and during that conversation claimed he was the driver.

However, later sitting in the back of an ambulance he was asked by police if he was the driver and replied: 'I can't remember now, but give me half an hour or so and I might remember. I woke up in the back with my friend Aiden and pulled the girl over the front. There were only four in the car.'

A breath test showed Basi had an alcohol count of 37. The legal limit is 22. A blood sample taken from him showed the presence of cocaine and ecstasy.

Lord Mulholland remanded first offender Basi in custody and deferred sentence on him until next month for background reports.

Solicitor advocate Billy Lavelle said: 'He works as a waiter in the family business.'
