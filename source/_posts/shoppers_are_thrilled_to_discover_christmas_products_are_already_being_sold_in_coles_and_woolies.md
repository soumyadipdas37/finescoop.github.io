Australians are rejoicing as Christmas products land on supermarket shelves more than four months ahead of the festive season.

Decorations and specialty festive themed bakery goods have already begun cropping up at Coles and Woolworths stores nationwide.

The new food range was launched on September 1, with almost four months left on the calendar until December 25. 

Keen shoppers shared their delight on social media after noticing the change in stores earlier this week. 

The conversation kicked off after one shopper shared a photograph of a large inflatable Santa Claus at Coles, Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast

Others shared photos of the new line of festive themed treats released by Coles and Woolworths

'It's started!' he wrote on the 'Markdown Addicts Australia' Facebook page.

Others joined in to share their joy about the upcoming holiday season.  

'Bring it on and let's say goodbye to this year,' said one.

'I'm all for it! Let's wrap up 2020 early and hope to god 2021 is much better than this disaster of a year!' another said.  

'Yessssss I love it. I'm going to start getting ready ASAP,' a third said. 

Both supermarket giants have a range of puddings and fruit mince pies 

But not everyone was so happy about celebrating Christmas in September.

'No way, its too early! Wont be long and the Easter bunny will be out again,' one woman said. 

'This early ruins it for me. The fun is over before it gets to the right date / time. I say at the start of November it should happen,' another added.

Others shared photos of the new line of festive themed treats released by Coles and Woolworths including Christmas puddings, cakes and a fruit mince pies.

Even those with a vegan diet are likely to approve of the new line, with the Coles branded Fruit Mince Pies 6 pack totally free of animal products. 

According to the supermarket giant thousands of customers bought more than one million mince pies in September 2019.

Coles Category Manger for Bakery Rosie Anderson said they're hoping the early arrival of Christmas will spread some much needed cheer during the pandemic.

'We've been working hard to bring a timely festive bakery collection to stores early to help raise the spirits of those Australians who need it most,' she said.

A Woolworths spokesperson said the four month head start will allow families to better budget for the festive season.  

'Some of our customers like to purchase products early and have them stocked away to help spread out their Christmas spend,' the spokesperson told Seven News.

'As the impact of the pandemic continues, many customers will be looking for ways to manage their budgets this Christmas and we want to help them do that.' 

Meanwhile a Sydney shopping centre has been slammed for erecting a large Christmas tree in the middle of August.

Shoppers were left stunned when they stumbled across the giant tree covered in fluorescent decorations in the middle of the Queen Victoria Building, in Sydney's CBD several weeks ago.

And while it was hoped the tree would help spread some joy during the coronavirus pandemic, some residents were less than impressed.

'I think it's insensitive,' one woman wrote. 'Just an early reminder to those struggling with job loss they can't afford presents this year for their kids.' 

Others thought the decorations were 'ugly' and didn't quite understand the timing. 

'Christmas already? Calm down,' another person wrote.

'Why is there a Christmas tree in the QVB in August? Why is it so ugly?' another asked.

While some shoppers thought the tree (pictured) was ugly, others enjoyed the whimsical aspects

However, some were happy with the colourful display.

'How pretty,' one wrote.

'So keen to see off 2020,' another wrote. 

A spokesman for the shopping centre said the tree was supposed to act as a symbol of 'joy and resilience for a time like no other'.

They worked with artist Gerwyn Davies to created 'The 2020 Tree', with the idea to make something magical from a 'collective mess'.
