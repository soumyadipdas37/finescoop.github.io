A maskless customer was filmed screaming about his 'rights and liberties' as he squared up to Walmart staff after they ordered him to leave the store. 

The heated exchange took place at a Walmart in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. 

Video footage, which has since gone viral, shows Walmart workers attempting to escort the man out of the store before he turns around and starts shouting at them.

Pointing his finger at a female staff member, he shouts: 'Get back on your highway to hell, and get out of a godly man's face!'

Store employees wearing masks can be heard asking the irate man to leave the store as he continues to shout at them. 

'You've not established authority to tell me to leave,' he tells a staff member, before demanding to see the store manager. 

A woman responds by saying there are four members of management present.  

The man, whose name has not been released, continues to accuse the employees of 'taking away his rights'.

One female worker follows the man as he begins walking towards the door once more before he turns around and starts squaring up to her

'Are you exercising your rights as a private company to take away my rights... you can say you can refuse service, are you refusing my service?' he shouts.

When asked by the store employees not to yell, he says: 'I choose to yell and you cannot stop me.' 

The irate customer then goes to leave before turning around again and accusing the workers of being 'ignorant'. 

'Please return to your service of Satan in your ignorant belief you are right,' he shouts at them. 

One female worker follows the man as he begins walking towards the door once more before he turns around and starts squaring up to her. 

'Do you want to stop me?' he says, as the woman filming the incident can be heard saying: 'Don't touch her!' 

'I've got you on video so why don't you just go ahead and leave.' 

The female employee tells him several times to have a good day as he demands her to 'bring the police.' 

He continues to shout that he has a 'right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness' and that his 'happiness is best served by standing in your face and saying you're a fool and wrong and you have no authority over me.' 

The man then turns his attention to the woman filming the video (left and right) and accuses her of threatening to hit him

The man then turns his attention to the woman filming the video and accuses her of threatening to hit him.  

In a longer video of the incident posted to Instagram, the man eventually storms out of the shop exit and into the car park after telling employees that they 'aren't even human'. 

In a statement provided to McClatchy News, Walmart said: 'It's unfortunate that this individual chose to express their displeasure in such an inappropriate manner, but we're proud our associates displayed patience and professionalism as they navigated this challenging situation.'

The video has been viewed over 9 million times since it was uploaded to Twitter on Sunday and has been retweeted more than 18,000 times.
