Jon Bon Jovi has revealed how the coronavirus pandemic has changed New York City.

The Bon Jovi frontman, 58, said he recently filmed his new music video for his song Do What You Can in Manhattan and the empty streets were 'surreal' and 'eerie'.

'It was really surreal. I was in Times Square shooting the first shot and there's no-one there,' he said on The Project on Wednesday.

'The band couldn't come in because you couldn't fly and I'm standing there singing my song [alone],' he continued.

Jon also said it was 'weird' singing to no-one as he'd previously sung to half a million people in Times Square.

'I was reminiscing when the NFL asked us to play Times Square and we played to half a million people and now you're singing a song 20 years later alone.' 

'That was like a weird Twilight zone,' he said.

This comes after Jon and his 25-year-old son Jesse Bongiovi teamed up to give music fans a virtual happy hour performance in mid-August.

The duo created a free event for charity, which included an acoustic performance by Jon and the Kings of Suburbia. 

Jon also shares daughter Stephanie Rose Bongiovi, 27, son Romeo Jon Bongiovi, 16, and Jacob Hurley Bongiovi, 18, with his wife Dorothea Hurley.

In March, the rockstar revealed that Jacob came down with a form of COVID-19 and whilst he took measures to quarantine himself, his symptoms were not serious.

Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, Jon said: 'The whole family is together, all the kids are here with us. We've been here 15 days now, not that I'm counting.'

'Jake had a mild version of it just the intestinal kind. Dorothea created the quarantine zone... and we kept him in there until all of the symptoms had cleared and now he's a hundred percent.'

Whilst they're convinced the illness Jacob had was coronavirus, they'd been unable to get a test for the teenager as it proved 'pretty difficult' to get hold of one.
