Rose Jacobs recently debuted a striking new look.

The TV presenter, who is the ex-wife of weatherman Stevie Jacobs, showed off her short blonde pixie cut while running errands in Sydney on Wednesday.

The 41-year-old was dressed casually in a pair of denim jeans and a mustard coloured cardigan.

She paired it with a grey tank top and white sneakers, and styled her hair with a scarf.

Rose was walking her dog, which she dressed in a cute pink coat.

The acclaimed journalist recently returned to media with the launch of her new financial podcast, Clever Money.

She's also partnered with Together Australia for an online show, which is aimed at helping everyday people through difficult financial times.

'I’m beyond delighted to be behind this campaign that is helping all of us through tough times, coming out stronger from the pandemic and being in charge of our own futures,' Rose announced on Instagram recently. 

'Thank you everyone for your support. Here’s the link for the new online show. I hope it inspires you to rise strong and stick together during tough times,' she added.

Rose told News.com.au this week that she decided to trim her brunette locks after she contracted dengue fever while living in Vanuatu with her family.

'When I was living in Vanuatu, I unfortunately contracted dengue fever, which is something that is similar to malaria. It's a mosquito-born virus that's really common in tropical environments,' she began.

'The reason I cut my hair initially was that I actually had a health situation which most people don't know about,' the mother-of-two explained.

Rose explained it was much easier to maintain shorter locks and feel comfortable amid Vanuatu's soaring temperatures.

'I was extremely unwell for a period of time,' she said.

The former Channel 10 star relocated from Sydney to Vanuatu in 2017 with her then-husband Steve, in a 'last-ditch' attempt to work on their marriage. The couple eventually split in 2018.
