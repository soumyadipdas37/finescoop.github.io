Jacinda Ardern has fired back at Karl Stefanovic after the Today host questioned whether she went 'too hard' with New Zealand's coronavirus response.

The prime minister defended her hard-line lockdown because it ensured her population was kept 'safe' during the health crisis.

'We want to keep our people safe. I absolutely stand by that decision we had, which was go hard, go early,' she told Today on Wednesday morning.

'It meant we lifted our restrictions sooner than many others. We got our open economy back and our death rate was low. 

'Ultimately what is an economy without a healthy people? That's been the basis of a lot of our decisions.'

Ms Ardern's justification came after Stefanovic claimed the strict coronavirus restrictions meant her nation suffered economically.

Stefanovic said: 'Few countries handled the health crisis better than you and New Zealand. 

'It did come at a huge economic cost. Much greater than Australia. Did you go too hard?'

Mr Ardern said she would 'dispute' the premise of the question.

'Actually, our unemployment's been lower. Our debt is lower.

'And of course there's a while to run, I think til we see the full impact on the likes of GDP but we should of course keep in mind, both countries had similar goals.'

Today host Allison Langdon also quizzed the prime minister whether Australians would be able to visit New Zealand for Christmas.    

'We have been working quite hard to try and get some arrangements underway,' Ms Ardern said. 

Ms Ardern advanced talks on the creation of the trans-Tasman bubble with counterpart Scott Morrison in a phone meeting on Tuesday night.

'There is a chance that we could have Australia simply open to New Zealand because of our status and where we are right now, which is pretty good,' she told AAP.

'They could just say, ''Well look one way (travel from New Zealand to Australia) is fine by us'' until we work through some of the detail, and it's a possibility.'

The NZ Labour leader, overseeing a COVID-19 elimination strategy, has established a series of criteria that must be met before opening borders to other nations.

That means New Zealand reciprocating and allowing Australians in for quarantine-free travel is a little further away.

The Victorian outbreak led to an impasse in trans-Tasman bubble talks with Australia, though Ms Ardern says Mr Morrison's embrace of a 'hotspot' system would allow travel to resume sooner.

'Essentially what a hotspot system would do, it would shut down those areas where there were heightened cases, while allowing the rest to be open. And so absolutely, we can also make that work,' she told AAP.

'What we just need to hear a bit more from Australia on is what the definition of a hotspot will be, how they'll manage the state borders in those situations, but we're working that through.'

Ms Ardern said opening up to Pacific nations - beginning with the Cook Islands - was 'absolutely' still part of New Zealand's re-engagement with the world.

'The threshold that we'll set will meet the Cooks' expectations,' she said.
