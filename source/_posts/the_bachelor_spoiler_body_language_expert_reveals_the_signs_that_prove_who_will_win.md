The identity of The Bachelor Locky Gilbert's winner may be a well-guarded secret. 

But a body language expert believes the 31-year-old may have unwittingly spoiled the outcome days ahead of the finale.

Matchsmith founder Holly Bartter told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that while  each of the final four contestants share a strong connection with Locky, Irena Srbinovska will ultimately steal his heart. 

Spoiler alert! Matchsmith founder Holly Bartter has revealed why body language cues prove Irena Srbinovska will ultimately steal The Bachelor Locky Gilbert's heart

'Irena feels like she' driving her relationship with Locky - although Locky and Bella have something really special also, I think her confidence will draw him in,' Holly said.   

After viewing the trailer for Wednesday's hometown dates, Holly noted that Locky's body language suggests he feels more 'in sync' with Irena than Bella. 

'Locky is good at being equally attentive to both women, but I do see a sense of more 'alignment' between him and Irena', she explained.

'I think her confidence will draw him in': Locky and Irena's emotional alignment is displayed through body language cues such as relaxed shoulders, strong posture, constant eye contact and mirroring of one another's expressions

This dynamic is displayed through body language cues such as relaxed shoulders, strong posture, constant eye contact and mirroring of one another's expressions. 

'[Locky and Irena] are on the same level, close together but both confident. I think it comes down to them being able to be close but not all over each other, being able to sit next to one another or in close quarters and still have that connection without touching,' said Holly.  

Conversely, Bella and Locky's body language shows an emotional imbalance between the pair.

Movements such as leaning backwards into Locky's arms suggests Bella is a more vulnerable character, while Locky is more protective.  

'I think he cares about her wellbeing and looking after her, and he's very sensitive to her needs - but with Irena they seem to be more in sync,' she explained.    

On the other hand, Holly believes Bec Cvilikas and Izzy Sharman-Firth are unlikely to progress to the grand finale.

According to the dating expert, Locky's body language indicates his connection with Bec is primarily physical. 

'From the moment she and Locky met, there was lots of chemistry and eye-contact... but  there's less emotional connection here for the two, although lots of touch and playfulness,' Holly noted. 

The expert added that footage from Wednesday's hometown trailer speaks volumes about the status of Bec and Locky's connection. 

'She's enjoying herself but not emotionally invested': Holly said that footage from Wednesday's hometown trailer proves Bec and Locky's relationship is purely physical 

'With her family, Bec is happy to lean back in her chair, there's more space between her and Locky - she's enjoying herself but not emotionally invested,' Holly said. 

Holly similarly believes Izzy has been placed squarely in the friend zone and therefore doesn't stand a chance against frontrunners Irena and Bella. 

'It took some time for Locky and Izzy to share a kiss, and I think that's due to them having fun together but not seeing her as a potential partner,' Holly observed.

Holly noted Locky and Izzy's lack of romantic chemistry was evident on their 'stages of life' themed solo date.  

'Locky seemed to laugh off a lot of it, commenting on how bubbly and positive Izzy is, but not sharing a kiss until the very end - they have a laugh together, but it's unlikely to go much further,' she said. 

Sorry Izzy! Similarly, Holly believes Izzy doesn't stand a chance against frontrunners Irena and Bella. Pictured: Izzy introducing Locky to her family in hometowns trailer
