A man who threw acid in his girlfriend's face and hacked her hand off with a meat cleaver has been jailed.

Kub Pha, 43, was on the run for 18 months before he was caught by police in Cambodia.

He was convicted in his absence of attacking his girlfriend San Chenda in the commune of Kandoeng in the district of Bati in the Cambodian province of Takeo.

He was sentenced in absentia to 14 years which began as soon as he was arrested according to The Sun.

The suspect was arrested after an 18-month manhunt for the attack on his girlfriend, which resulted in her losing her left hand.  

According to a National Police report, Pha attacked his lover because she wanted to split up with him.

At one point it was feared he had fled abroad after hiding from the authorities in the provinces of Pailin, Pursat and Battambang according to Khmer Times. 

He was finally arrested in the commune of O’Samril in the district of Samlout in the north-western province of Battambang.

An arrest warrant was issued on 8th April this year, and Pha was initially charged with attempted murder by the Takeo Provincial Court on April 18.
