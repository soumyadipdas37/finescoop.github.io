Lewis Hamilton has described Stefano Domenicali's return to Formula One as 'amazing' and believes the future of the sport is in good hands.

The Italian, a former team principal of Ferrari, has been named the new president and chief executive officer.

Chase Carey, the chairman and CEO of F1 since January 2017, will step back to a non-executive chairman role and relinquish day-to-day control.

And six-time world champion Hamilton was among many to welcome Domenicali's appointment.

'Amazing. I know Stefano really well. He's one of the nicest guys that I know,' Hamilton said ahead of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.

'I don't think they could have chosen someone better, to be honest, to replace some big shoes of Chase, who has done an amazing job and has always had such a great approach.

'Stefano has got a great heart. He's got a good family and good morals. The future's positive.'

Domenicali, 55, worked as Ferrari team principal between 2008 and 2014, and has since worked with the Volkswagen Group and as the chief executive of Lamborghini.

Domenicali has been chief executive of Lamborghini in recent years after leaving Formula 1

He has also been head of the single-seater commission of F1's governing body the FIA and will continue in that role.

The Italian said: 'I am thrilled to join the Formula 1 organisation, a sport that has always been part of my life.

'I was born in Imola and live in Monza. I've remained connected to the sport through my work with the single-seater commission at the FIA and I look forward to connecting with the teams, promoters, sponsors and many partners in F1 as we continue to drive the business ahead.

'The past six years at Audi and then leading Lamborghini [both part of the Volkswagen Group] have given me broader perspective and experience that I will bring to Formula 1.'
