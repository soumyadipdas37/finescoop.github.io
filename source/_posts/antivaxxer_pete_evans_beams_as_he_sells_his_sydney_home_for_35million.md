Disgraced celebrity chef Pete Evans sold his Malabar mansion for a whopping $3.5million on Saturday.

And the anti-vaxxer, 47, appeared very confident as he took a stroll with his real estate agent moments before the auction kicked off.

Clad in a denim button-up shirt and black boardshorts, the conspiracy theorist grinned as he enjoyed a breezy discussion with his agent.

Pete completed his weekend ensemble with flip-flops and a yellow trucker hat emblazoned with the image of a rainbow. 

He also clutched what appeared to be a pet transportation bag, presumably containing his beloved dog Shikoba.  

Pete was also seen making several barefoot trips to his car, before eventually driving away.

While the axed My Kitchen Rules judge failed to attend the auction in person, he did keep abreast of the bidding via telephone.

Pete's name could be seen on the iPhone screen of one of the real estate agent during the auction, showing the celebrity chef had dialed in to hear the results live. 

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 friendly auction saw a plethora hopeful buyers maintaining a social distance from each other on the street.

The five-bedroom home, which was designed by Pete Evans and his wife Nicola Robinson, was sold at auction for $3,366,000- well over the listed price of $3.2million. 

Property records show that Pete bought the property in 2014 for $1.27 million, before building a new house on the land.

The house, which Pete and his wife Nicola only finished building 18 months ago, boasts an open plan living area, three bathrooms and a double garage.

It also features an alfresco entertainment room and a hotel-inspired master bedroom complete with an ensuite and walk-in wardrobe.

Unsurprisingly, the property features an exquisitely designed kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances and a luxurious Caesarstone benchtop.

It also boasts a custom-built skate ramp outside, as well as a herb garden, solar panels and a heated magnesium swimming pool.

Pete is reported to be selling up his Sydney properties amid his move to Byron Bay, where he is planning to open his Evolve Health Labs clinic. 

According to the company's Instagram account, the clinic will offer 'transformational practices' such as 'cold and conscious breath-work' and 'cryotherapy'.

Pete owns a farm just a short drive from Byron Bay, and has been self-isolating on the property with his family for much of the COVID-19 pandemic.
