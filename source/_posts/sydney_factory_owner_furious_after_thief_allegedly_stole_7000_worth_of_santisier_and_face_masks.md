A business owner has an angry message for the man who allegedly stole thousand of dollars worth of hand sanisiter and face masks from his western Sydney factory.

The accused, 34, will appear in court this month over the alleged theft from a business in Propect near Blacktown in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Police allege the man ram raided the warehouse to break in before using a forklift to load two pallets containing 1,350 bottles of hand sanitiser and thousands of dollars worth of face masks into his vehicle.

CCTV captured the Toyota Land Cruiser entering and leaving the factory, which helped police track down the vehicle later that afternoon near Penrith.

Factory owner John-Carlos El Khouri bewildered.

'Mate, you're a scumbag. Honestly, who [allegedly] steals sanisiter?' Mr El Khouri told Nine News.   

 

His auto parts factory warehouse is packed with pallets of products to keep Australians safe during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

'We've brought these products in to offset some of the losses that we've copped because of the pandemic,'  Mr El Khouri said.

The Toyota Land Cruiser was captured entering the Rowood Road premises around 1.45am on Tuesday.

Mr El Khouri claimed the driver hit a water pipe on the way in and out of the premises, leaving a muddy mess behind.

'He's had to travel around the back of the building to get to the front of the building to smash open the doors,' Mr El Khouri said.

The Blacktown Proactive Crime Team commenced an investigation and tracked down the still dirty vehicle at a Cranebrook home near Penrith on Tuesday afternoon.
