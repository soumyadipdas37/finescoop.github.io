Aubameyang has agreed in principle a new £250,000-per-week deal with the Gunners

The academy graduate has three years left on his deal at the Emirates and recently celebrated his first call-up for the England senior team. If he agrees to stay at Arsenal, he could be rewarded with a new, improved contract.

Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez is another player Arteta is desperate to keep ahead of the new season. 

The Argentine was picked ahead of usual first-choice stopper Bernd Leno in the Community Shield victory against Liverpool on Saturday.

A superb finish from Aubameyang in the 12th minute was cancelled out my a second half goal from Takumi Minamino for the Reds. 

Arsenal won the match after the penalty shootout, as Rhian Brewster struck the crossbar and every Gunners penalty taker found the back of the net. 

Stopper Martinez made it clear after the club's FA Cup triumph, in which he featured throughout the tournament, that he wants to fight for the No 1 jersey.

Aston Villa have shown interest however Arteta wants to keep both Martinez and Maitland-Niles for next season and fund the cash they need for their summer rebuild from other players in the club.

The Gunners are close to completing a £27m deal for Lille defender Gabriel and have also targeted Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey whilst they continue to have talks with Real Madrid over a new loan deal for Dani Ceballos.

Defender Rob Holding is set to leave the Emirates and join Newcastle on loan, whilst Matteo Guendouzi could be sold after falling out of the picture in the latter stages of last season.
