Sir Elton John has revealed that he won't be kicking off the next leg of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road until late next year, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The veteran musician, 73, had already announced in April – at the initial height of the pandemic – that he had planned to push the dates of his roadshow back.

And the British star has now announced the official dates, with his UK and Europe dates starting in the autumn of  2021, with North American following in January 2022 and New Zealand fans having to wait until 2023 for his shows.

Long wait: Sir Elton John has revealed that he won't be kicking off the next leg of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road until late next year, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 

In a statement released on Wednesday, he said: 'I’ve been enjoying my time at home with the family while the world navigates its way through the COVID pandemic.

'But, I really miss being on the road and performing for my beloved fans in my Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour.

'While the scientists are making great progress, we are making big plans for a return to touring that will allow us to ensure the health and safety of everyone.

'I will be starting my tour again in Europe and the UK in the Fall of 2021. And I will be back in North America starting in January 2022. This means my New Zealand dates will be postponed until 2023.'

The star added: 'Don’t worry about me. I’m using my downtime to keep myself fighting fit and healthier than ever. I’m raring to go! As always, thank you so much for your loyal support.

'I look forward to seeing all you wonderful Elton John fans soon. In the meantime, please stay safe and be well. Thank you!'

The star, whose New Zealand and Australia leg of the tour was marred by ill health back in February, announced earlier this year that he was halting the show.

An announcement via his official Twitter account read: 'It is with deep regret that Elton John must postpone the remainder of his upcoming North American 2020 dates on his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour from May 22 through July 8.'

The statement continued: 'Previously postponed performances were from March 26 through May 2, 2020.'

'This tough decision has been made with the continued safety and well-being of his fans at a time when health services are under increased pressure and with the concern that these gatherings continue to risk accelerating the spread of the Coronavirus [COVID-19].' 

The series of tweets ended with a promise that Elton will perform live around the world again and thanked fans for their 'endless support'.

The hitmaker announced in January 2018 that he planned to stop touring and would embark on a final three-year series of concerts dubbed the Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.

He said he wanted to retire from the road in order to spend more time with his husband David Furnish and their sons - Zachary, nine, and Elijah, seven.

The tour, with a planned 300 concerts around the world, kicked off on September 8, 2018, in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

The first leg across North America ran until March 2019 before moving to Europe from May to July.

The third leg was back in North America from September to November 2019 and then the recording artist headed Down Under for concerts in Australia and New Zealand from December 2019 through early March 2020. 

However, in mid-February, Elton had to end his Auckland concert early due to illness and had to be helped off stage. 

As he prepared to sing the lyrics to his hit Daniel, an emotional Elton told the audience that he couldn't go on.

'I've just completely lost my voice. I can't sing. I've got to go,' he said, before being escorted off the stage by a medic. 

It was revealed he was suffering from walking pneumonia.
