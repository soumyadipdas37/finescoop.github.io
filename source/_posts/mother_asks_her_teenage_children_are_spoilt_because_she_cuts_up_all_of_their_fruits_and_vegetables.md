An Australian mother has asked the internet if she is 'spoiling' her teenage children by cutting up all of their fruit and vegetables - but not everyone agrees it's over the top.

The woman shared an image of her fridge and all of the carefully arranged storage containers inside of it, which make preparing meals for her kids a lot easier. 

'Okay mums who else has a husband and kids that won't touch fruit and veggies unless they're cut up and ready to eat?' She wrote under the photo, which was posted to Facebook.

'I cook a lot and eat healthy, but now I'm starting to think I've spoiled them too much. I'm saying this because my kids are 16 and 18.'

 Is your teenager spoiled if you cut their fruit and vegetables up?

Although she would rather prepare their food than watch them turn to 'unhealthy snacks' and 'start eating c**p', she wondered whether the mollycoddling had to stop.

'It would seem they are at the selfish, lazy age,' one woman said. 'Get them to help you cut up the food, it shouldn't all be on you'.

'Sounds like you've spoiled them and they need a kick up the bum and told to stop being lazy and cut their own,' said another.

Others said their own parents had cut up fruit and vegetables for them as teens and this didn't make them 'spoilt', just appreciative later in life.

'Yessss! Mine loves mangoes but can never be bothered cutting them up. So I put them in containers, right in front of their eyes,' one woman said.

'I love this! I find if it's ready to eat like this they'll reach for that instead of something unhealthy. Great job Mumma,' said another (stock image)

The original poster said her children will eat the cut up fruit in as little as two days, but she would have to throw it out if she left it whole.

She had containers filled with watermelon, blueberries, strawberries, mango and rockmelon for the children to choose from.

Ultimately others agreed that it was down to the individual family to decide if the hassle was worth it.
