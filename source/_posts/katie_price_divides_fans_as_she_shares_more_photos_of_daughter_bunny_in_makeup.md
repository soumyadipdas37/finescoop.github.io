Katie Price divided fans as she shared photos of her daughter Bunny in a full face of make-up and false lashes.

The former glamour model's mini-me appeared in great spirits as she wore foundation, glittery eyeshadow and eyelash extensions.

Mother-of-five Katie, 42, sparked backlash from some of her social media followers who claimed her youngest child is 'far too young' to experiment with make-up, while others defended her decision.

'She's too young': Katie Price divided fans as she shared photos of her daughter Bunny in a full face of make-up and false lashes on Instagram on Sunday

The media personality, who shares Bunny and Jett, six, with ex Kieran Hayler, Junior, 15, and Princess, 13, with former spouse Peter Andre, and Harvey, 18, from a relationship with his estranged father Dwight Yorke, 48, claimed her kid's love for beauty runs in the family.

She wrote in an accompanying caption: 'Bunny loves makeup so much which isn’t a surprise because her sister @officialprincess_andre and me love it.' (sic)

Coming under fire on social media, some commented: 'Too young .. not a good look.... Not false eyelashes no far too young. Make up yes all girls want too.

There's no stopping her: A month earlier, the reality star, 42, uploaded a slew of snaps of herself posing with her mini-me, who also rocked a leather jacket and the same make-up look

Cute: The former glamour model's child wore foundation, glittery eyeshadow and eyelash extensions 

'She’s beautiful...but nobody needs fake lashes... Too young to be wearing fake eyelashes but ok.

'Personally she's a bit young for makeup, but it's gonna happen with a beautiful mummy like hers. She is so like you Katie! What a pretty little girl.' (sic)

Others stood by the reality TV star's choice as they added: 'Ah so cute and they haters will come but every little girl loves 2 try out make up don’t see the harm.

'Hahaha the Karen’s. so what’s the difference between this and dance kids? My daughters have worn makeup on stage for dance comps since they were 3... and yes lashes and all!! Some people are far too sensitive!

'Bunny loves make-up so much which isn't a surprise!' The My Crazy Life star claimed Bunny's love for beauty runs in the family

'Your baby you do what you want and she clearly loves it xx 

'Omg the comments, most little girls want to experiment with make up, I bought my 8 year old some of her own as I was sick of her in my make up bag! We also have lovely little mother and daughter bonding times when I crimp or straighten her hair and I proudly post the pics on my social media. 

'I’m not one for the pageants or dancers caked in fake tan but ffs what exactly is wrong with a bit on make up on if it makes the child happy and gives them a happy memory of their childhood!! 











Uh oh: Mother-of-five Katie sparked backlash from some of her social media followers who claimed her youngest child is 'far too young' to experiment with make-up

'I don’t see a prob with this at all, if she likes makeup like this she might grow up to be a professional makeup artist... If your a young dancer they look like this and put lashes on etc etc pretty dresses... let her dress up she’s only doing girly stuff after all xx.' (sic) MailOnline has contacted Katie's representatives for further comment. 

A month earlier, Katie uploaded a slew of snaps of herself posing with Bunny, who also rocked a leather jacket and the same make-up look.

The TV star received backlash from followers within minutes of uploading the post, with some hitting out at her for putting red lipstick, heavy contour and winged eyeliner on her daughter.   









'I don't see a problem with it': Others defended the media personality's decision

Others were worried Bunny drinking Coca-Cola, due to its high sugar content. 

In the photos, Katie used drink cans as hair rollers and looked glamorous as she wore a full face of make-up, which she recreated on Bunny.

Katie captioned the post: 'Never underestimate the pricey, I know what’s coming up... #bunnyisinheavenwiththemakeup'.

One wrote in the comments: 'Omg so wrong to put a child in full make up on where anyone can see it!!!!', another added: 'Wrong on a levels!'.

A third follower chimed: 'Really all that make-up on a toddler?'. Another typed: 'That poor child being morphed into her mother'. 

A fifth wrote: 'I don't agree with eyeliner on the child, please let them be children'. 











Backlash: One wrote in the comments: 'Omg so wrong to put a child in full make up on where anyone can see it!!!!', another added: 'Wrong on a levels!'

However, some of Katie's followers took to her defence, one wrote: 'Beautiful', while another added: 'Love love this'.

A third chimed: 'Aw Bunny is beautiful, I didn't think you looked that similar but I think she's starting to look more like you x'

A fourth fan added: 'You look stunning ❤️ look at bunny she looks cute , my little girl loves putting make up on playing about xx'.  

The makeover no doubted lifted Katie's spirits after being left in excruciating pain following six-hour surgery on her broken feet earlier in the month.
