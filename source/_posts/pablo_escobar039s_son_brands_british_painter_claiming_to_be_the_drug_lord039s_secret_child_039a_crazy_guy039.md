Pablo Escobar&#039;s son has revealed he is furious with a man who claims to be his brother as he says there are &#039;holes in his story&#039;.&nbsp;
Sebastian Marroquin, 43, says that Phillip Witcomb, 55, is &#039;the third guy in the world who claims to be the first-born&#039;. He added &#039;I&rsquo;m used to this kind of crazy guy.&#039;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr Witcomb, a painter, now lives in Mallorca and says his original name is&nbsp;Roberto Sendoya Escobar.&nbsp;

Mr Marroquin,&nbsp;who has met around 150 families of his father&rsquo;s victims to ask for their forgiveness, told The Mirror that his father told him there are no sons outside of his marriage.&nbsp;
He said Escobar told him &#039;he&#039;d forced the abortion of one of his mistresses&#039;.&nbsp;
Mr Witcomb said he found out about his birth father in 1989 in what he described as &#039;an extraordinary moment&#039;.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Under his birth name, Mr Witcomb wrote a novel titled Son Of Escobar First Born which was published earlier this month.&nbsp;
Mr Marroquin said Escobar (pictured) wasn&#039;t the head of a cartel then, but was a farmer and student
In an interview at the beginning of this month, Mr Witcomb said his adoptive father regularly took him, as a young boy, to visit Escobar in Medellin.&nbsp;
He said this was to keep the drug lord on board and to track his movements for MI6.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But Mr Marroquin claims his father would have been 16 when Mr Witcomb said his father was working for MI6 to bring Escobar to authorities.&nbsp;
Mr Marroquin said Escobar wasn&#039;t the head of a cartel then, but was a farmer and student.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr Witcomb added that he was recently given a series of codes, which he is yet to decipher, which lead to his birth father&#039;s missing millions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He said his birth, after an encounter between his father, then aged 16, and Maria Luisa Sendoya, who was 14, was kept quiet.&nbsp;
He does not have a birth certificate which names Escobar as his father but says a baptism document claims he was born to the drug lord.&nbsp;
MailOnline has contacted Phillip Witcomb for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
