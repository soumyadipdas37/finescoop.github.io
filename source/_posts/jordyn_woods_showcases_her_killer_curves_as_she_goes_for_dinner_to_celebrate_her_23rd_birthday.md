Jordyn also wore a shimmering necklace and matching earrings, completing her look with a daring red lip.

Alongside the video, she wrote: 'Walking into my birthday dinner like... thank you for all of the sweet wishes'.

At the beginning of 2019, Jordyn blamed her alleged kiss with the NBA player on being 'blackout drunk' and nothing more than a 'stupid' drunken mistake, an insider told TMZ.

The cheating scandal, which also came as a betrayal to her former best friend Kylie, ended her relationship with the Kardashian-Jenner family.

More than a year after the fall-out from the indiscretion, she is 'working' and 'had a stint on a TV show.'

A source furthered noted to People: 'She's not doing too much, but is staying busy.'

Connections gone wrong: Jordyn's friendship with Kylie ended after she was caught kissing Khloe Kardashian's boyfriend and  the father of her child, Tristan Thompson 

After the scandal came out into the public, the model was quick to appear on Jada Pinkett-Smith's Red Table Talk to speak about what had gone down from her side.

During her appearance on the Facebook series, she admitted kissing Tristan, though she claimed that it wasn't 'intimate.'

She also broke down during the interview, saying she was 'no homewrecker' and denied being that the reason Khloé and Tristan's split.

Tristan, who shares a two-year-old daughter with Khloe, has never publicly addressed his side of the cheating scandal.
