Alex wore her honey-dyed tresses in a chic bob and upped the glam with a slick of red lip.

Meanwhile Gethin looked smart in a navy blue t-shirt and jeans and looked thrilled to be in the driving seat.

It comes after Alex came under fire from unimpressed viewers for not adhering to social distancing rules on last Tuesday's episode of The One Show.

She was interviewing Max George after he was announced as one of the contestants on this year's Strictly Come Dancing.  

After a brief chat about the show, Alex appeared to forget about current guidelines around social distancing as she leaned in and touched Max's arm and patted him into the lift.

Viewers quickly took to social media to hit out at the host for forgetting about the current rules amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

One user said: 'Alex touching Max just then so much for distancing,' while another added: 'Back in the lift, touch him on the arm, no 'distancing' Alex'. 

Another viewer said: 'Oh dear, Alex Jones *touched* Max George. They'll be letters!' 

The show came to an end before the lack of social distancing could be addressed on the air.
