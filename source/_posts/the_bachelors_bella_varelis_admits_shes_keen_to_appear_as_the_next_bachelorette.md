Just a day after getting her heart broken during The Bachelor finale, Bella Varelis has once again hinted she could become Australia's next Bachelorette.

Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, the 25-year-old Bachelor runner-up confessed she'd love to be cast on the reality show. 

'Yeah, I mean, what a way to get your happily ever after!' she said.

Coming soon? Just a day after getting her heart broken during The Bachelor finale, Bella Varelis admitted she already has her sights set on becoming the next Bachelorette 

Her candid admission came shortly before Bella praised Network 10 - which screens both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette - in a series of posts on Instagram Stories.

'A big thank you to my Channel 10 family (you know who you are) for making me smile through the tough parts of last night,' she wrote.

'I'm so excited to start this new journey and you are all apart [sic] of that.'

In a second post, she shared a photo of herself with Studio 10 hosts Sarah Harris and Tristan MacManus shortly after appearing on the Network 10 talk show.

'Had an absolute ball with Sarah and Tristan this morning on @studio10au, thank you for being so lovely and supportive,' she captioned it.   

Earlier on Friday, the brunette beauty also told radio hosts Daniel 'Gawndy' Gawned and Maz Compton it would be great to have her very own 'love story' play out on-screen.

'I know that you can genuinely find love on The Bachelor or Bachelorette. I genuinely did fall in love with Locky [Gilbert] and I mean, if the way I find my happily ever after is having to make one of them end up saying yes to me at the end, I guess maybe that's my way in,' she said.

'I don't know, it would be nice. I have been one of the girls, I think I'd have empathy with how they are feeling and being in that position.'  

Bella was left shell-shocked during Thursday's Bachelor finale when Locky, 31, told both her and love rival Irena Srbinovska he loved them - only to dump her.

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' Locky Gilbert told Bella, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me'

He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.

'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'
