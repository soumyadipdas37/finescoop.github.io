Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox went public with their romance in May, after meeting on the set of the movie Midnight In The Switchgrass.

'That's a really good [question],' Machine Gun Kelly replied to journalist Tommy Little, momentarily speechless.

After calling out Megan's name in his Los Angeles home, he remarked: '[She's] on a phone call right now. I should ask her.' 

However, the rapper reminded Tommy that they weren't a couple at the time.

Machine Gun Kelly spoke about his instant connection with Megan on The Howard Stern Show this month, as reported by People.

'I didn't know what [love] was until me and her made eye contact... That's when I was like, "Whoa!'' he said.

The Houston native added: 'That was my first experience with being open to love and stuff like that. I definitely wasn't set up to believe that that's something that could ever exist.'
