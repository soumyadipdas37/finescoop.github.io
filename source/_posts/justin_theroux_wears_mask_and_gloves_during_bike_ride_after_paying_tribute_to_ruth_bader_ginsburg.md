He is not a man who can stay still for very long.

And exercise enthusiast Justine Theroux once again hit the streets of Manhattan for a bike ride on Friday, wearing a protective mask and gloves.

His latest exercise excursion comes one day after he paid tribute to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg following the announcement of her death at the age of 87.

Always one to have an edgy style to his fashion, The Leftovers star looked casual-cool in a military-green bomber jacket with a quilted design.  

He also donned faded skinny blue jeans and a pair of matching high-top sneakers.

And with the COVID-19 pandemic still very much a health crisis, Theroux kept a black-patterned mask over his mouth and nose and protective gloves on his hands at all times.

Theroux was among the many people to share their heartbreak and gratitude over the passing of Justice Ginsburg on Friday.

'I am heartbroken. I have no words for the hole that has just been blown through us,' he wrote in the caption of two photos of himself with Justice Ginsburg.

'Thank you for your service Justice Ginsburg. We'll miss you RBG. I love you Ruth.'

The actor had a special connection with the high court's second female Justice as he played Melvin 'Mel' Wulf in On The Basis Of Sex, the 2018 biopic film about her life and early cases while she sat on the Supreme Court.

British actress Felicity Jones played the trailblazing Justice in the film which also starred Armie Hammer, Kathy Bates, Jack Reynor, Sam Waterston and Cailee Spaeny.

'Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave us hope, a public figure who stood for integrity and justice — a responsibility she did not wear lightly,' Jones said in a statement as reported by Deadline. 

'She will be missed not only as a beacon of light in these difficult times but for her razor sharp wit and extraordinary humanity. She taught us all so much. I will miss her deeply.'
