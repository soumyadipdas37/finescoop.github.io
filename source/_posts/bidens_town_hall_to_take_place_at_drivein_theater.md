Democratic nominee Joe Biden will have an audience for his Thursday night CNN town hall in suburban Scranton as the network created a drive-in movie theater set-up inside a ball park. 

Biden will answer questions from Pennsylvania voters, as 35 cars with about 100 onlookers watch.   

The Anderson Cooper moderated Q&A will take place at PNC field, where the aptly named Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders play.   

Joe Biden will participate in a town hall Thursday night put on by CNN. For the event, the network set up a drive-in movie theater in the center of a minor league ballpark outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania

Joe Biden will answer questions from Pennsylvania voters as 35 cars of people, or about 100 audience members, look on. The presidential town hall will be moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper 

Joe Biden supporters celebrate the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention last month in a parking lot outside the Chase Center in Wilmington that was set up like a drive-in movie theater 

Supporters in the parking lot were able to see (from left) Jill and Joe Biden, as well as Douglas Emhoff and Kamala Harris, watch fireworks at the conclusion of Biden's speech accepting the Democratic nomination  

The old school drive-in has become a stand-in - at least on the Democratic side - for campaign rallies, as Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris have preached caution about supporters attending gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

The Democratic Party set up a drive-in in a parking lot outside the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware on the final night of the Democratic National Convention so there would be an audience to cheer Biden and Harris as they emerged together as the official presidential ticket to watch fireworks.

Supporters watched the virtual convention on large screens and then cheered and honked their horns when Biden and Harris briefly appeared.  

In cities around the country, watch parties were set up drive-in style so Democratic supporters could watch Biden's nominating speech together.  

The town hall brings Biden - who was born in Scranton before moving to Wilmington - to the key swing state two days after President Donald Trump made the trek to Philadelphia for his own town hall with voters. 

Trump's town hall was produced by ABC News and was filmed indoors at the National Constitution Center, where the only audience was the likely voters questioning the president. 

Joe Biden's town hall comes two days after President Donald Trump participated in a Philadelphia town hall, filmed indoors at the National Constitution Center, with only people posing questions as audience members. They wore masks and sat six feet apart 

They all sat six feet apart and wore masks, until they posed their questions to Trump.  

The president has been more cavalier about his campaigning amid a continued spread of the coronavirus. 

Last weekend he held his first indoor rally since June in the state of Nevada. 

He's packed thousands into airport hangars as well. 

The campaign has encouraged mask-wearing of attendees, but droves have rebelled. 

At a recent rally in New Hampshire, Trump supporters booed when the loudspeaker encouraged them to wear masks. 

The president told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he wasn't personally worried about contracting the coronavirus.  

'I'm on a stage and it's very far away,' he told the paper. 'And so I'm not at all concerned.'
