Kris Jenner 'will never get married again'.

According to a family friend, the 64-year-old matriarch - who has six children from her marriages to the late Robert Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner - doesn't plan to tie the knot with longtime partner Corey Gamble.

 'Kris is still with Corey but she's not engaged and they won't get engaged,' a friend told The Sun. 'She will never get married again. This works for her.'

No thanks: Kris Jenner will never wed again, a friend told The Sun. Seen with Robert Kardashian at their nuptials in 1978. They divorced in 1991

The couple met at designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday bash in Ibiza in 2014.

Two years ago, Kris fueled speculation she was engaged to 39-year-old toyboy Corey.

The momager sparked rumours she and her boyfriend had taken their relationship to the next level after she was spotted numerous times sporting a huge diamond on her ring finger, but she refused to answer any questions on the subject.

The second time: And the 64-year-old star was wed to Bruce Jenner from 1991 until 2015; seen at their wedding with Kim, Kourtney and Khloe in attendance

The good years: Together they welcomed Kendall and Kylie; seen in the 1990s

They went their separate ways: After they split, Bruce transitioned into Caitlyn Jenner; Kris and Cait in November 2015

Instead, during a game of 'Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts' while appearing as a guest on James Corden's 'Late Late Show', Kris opted to eat dead crickets rather than reveal whether or not she was engaged.

She said: 'No, I am not going to answer.'

As she struggled to eat the insects, James laughed and said the ring answered the question on its own - but the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star then slipped up with her response.

They will not walk down the aisle:Â 'Kris is still with Corey but she's not engaged and they won't get engaged,' a friend told The Sun; seen in February in Hollywood

She retorted: 'This is not the ring.'

The host replied: 'But there is a ring!'

Kris refused to say any more and also opted to down a sardine smoothie rather than choose which of her daughters she'd axe from their E! reality show - which it was recently revealed will end next year - if she had to choose one.

She said: 'I'm not gonna turn on one of my girls. Those are my babies.

'Trust me, they wouldn't have understood. I couldn't have gone home. I would just have to go to another city.'

The end: The Kardashians announced the finish of Keeping Up With The Kardashians will happen in 2021 with season 20
