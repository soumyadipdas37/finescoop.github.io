A volleyball coach at an elite private college proposed to a 15-year-old student only four months after they started a secret affair, a court has heard. 

Ezra Barton Burtt, 38, had sex with the underage girl on the grounds of the private girls' college in Brisbane where he was working in 2018.

When she broke off the relationship he stalked her, driving by her house and leaving notes until her family installed security cameras.

The 38-year-old was sentenced to a maximum of six years' jail after appearing at the Brisbane District Court on Friday, reported the Courier Mail. 

He pleaded guilty to 28 charges including indecent treatment of a child under 16, maintaining an unlawful relationship with a child and making child exploitation materials.

He was also sentenced over supplying liquor to a minor and stalking.

The court heard the volleyball coach was still engaged to another woman in the United States when he began the unlawful relationship. 

After asking the teenager's mother if he could spend more time with the girl he pursued her on and off the school grounds for a number of months. 

This was despite the mother telling him it was highly inappropriate. 

But the pair were caught by another student in November 2018, who alerted the college.

The court heard the school removed him from the faculty and contacted Queensland Police.

'The school responded immediately and the defendant was suspended from the school,' Prosecutor Sandra Cupina said. 

But when the coach was contacted he told police the relationship was 'purely platonic'.

He then flew over to the United States to be with his fiancee, but not before taking his victim to a hotel and proposing to her the night before his flight.

Months later his partner in the US uncovered a series of photos of Burtt with the teenager on a USB. 

Defence barrister Kate Juhasz said the sports coach offered a 'very low risk' of reoffending and described Burtt's remorse over his actions. 

Justice David Jackson said the sports coach had abused his position of power to take advantage of the minor. 

Burtt will be eligible for parole in September 2022.

The volleyball coach grew up around Bundaberg Queensland, even running as a Labor candidate for the seat of Maryborough in the 2012 state election.

Any trace of the coach's connection to the political party have since been removed from the ALP website.
