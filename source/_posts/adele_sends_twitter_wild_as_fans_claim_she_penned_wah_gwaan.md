Adele has set the Internet alight once more amid the cultural appropriation scandal she has faced since sharing a post to mark the cancelled Notting Hill Carnival. 

On Sunday, the Hello hitmaker, 32, was criticised for wearing a Jamaican flag bikini and styling her hair in bantu knots for an Instagram photo, causing a divisive storm which led to some slamming the move and others lauding the tribute. 

During Brandy and Monica's Verzuz Live on Monday, it has been claimed that she wrote: 'Wah Gwaan! Yow gyal, yuh look good enuh', in an apparent response to the scandal, yet social media users have questioned the authenticity of the message. 

Twitter was divided over whether the screengrab of her comment was Photoshopped, with some seeming tickled by the message and others insisting it was merely a 'badly' digitally manipulated shot.

Row: The chart-topping singer was criticised for wearing a Jamaican flag bikini and styling her hair in bantu knots for an Instagram photo paying tribute to London's Notting Hill Carnival 

The scandal erupted after Adele shared the striking snap, in which she paid homage to the carnival, yet accusations of appropriation were rife. 

Despite this, Naomi Campbell, MP David Lammy and endless reams of other fans lent their support to the star, while Piers Morgan echoed the statement and branded the row 'absolute guff' on Monday's Good Morning Britain. 

As the scandal rages on, it was claimed by Twitter users that Adele returned to social media while watching the live stream on Verzuz, a webcast series created by producers Timbaland and Swizz Beatz. 

After the feed aired, a screengrab began circulating showing a comment looking to be from Adele's account in an apparent nod to Caribbean dialect following the controversy over her hairstyle and bikini top.

Fans who spotted the screengrab and believed the image to be real soon swarmed Twitter to praise her response, with users writing: 'Adele's energy is everything! Just saw her comment in the Brandy/Monica Versuz... 

'Adele was trying to trigger them again this morning.' [sic]

Yet others were not so convinced of the authenticity as a host of social media users took to the site to mock the grab and those believing the response. 

Disbelievers however penned: 'nah bc i thought that comment by adele on the brandy & monica verzuz was real... Not Adele in the Brandy and Monica Verzuz live... Whoever photoshopped this is crazy as hell... 



Tickled: Fans who spotted Adele's comment soon swarmed Twitter to praise her response, with users writing: 'Adele's energy is everything! Just saw her comment in the Brandy/Monica Versuz... Adele was trying to trigger them again this morning'

'The amount of people who think this is real Loudly crying face (I was one of them but saw the light)... not people asking if this is real lmfao... Photoshop man... 

'Wait this isn’t real is it?!!!... Badly... Lmfaooooo this photoshop has me screaming.' [sic]

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Adele. 

In the picture shared to her Instagram, Adele, posing in the garden of her $9.5million Beverly Hills home, some branded her choice as 'insensitive'. 

While some claimed the singer was profiting off black culture by sporting the style, many others pointed out the star grew up in Tottenham, London and has been surrounded by black culture throughout her life. 











 

Not true: Many fans claimed the image had been digitally manipulated 

Supermodel Naomi , whose mother was born in Jamaica, commented on Adele's Instagram photo with two love heart emojis and two pictures of the Jamaican flag.

Actress Zoe Saldana also commented, telling the singer 'you look right at home guurrrl!' While Jamaican musician Popcaan shared a fist emoji and a love heart. 

Other fans took to Twitter to point out to Adele's critics that she was surrounded by Jamaican culture while growing up in Tottenham, and has always been a supporter of the Notting Hill Carnival.

The star was born in Tottenham before moving with her mother Penny Adkins to Brighton at the age of nine.

In 1999, at the age of 11 she and her mother moved back to London; first to Brixton, then to the neighbouring district of West Norwood in south London, which is the subject of her first song Hometown Glory. 

The video which Adele was said to have commented on was digital show Verzuz, which was born during the COVID-19 pandemic as a virtual DJ battle.

After years of feud rumours, former collaborators Monica and Brandy joined for the first time in eight years, with the meet-up breaking records for Verzuz, by reaching 1million concurrent views and peaking at 1.2million.

The duo, who collaborated on 1998's iconic hit The Boy Is Mine addressed their tensions, with Monica alleging the beef was a marketing strategy.
