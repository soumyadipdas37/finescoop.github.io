Ireland showed off an arsenal of inkwork with tattoos covering her arms as she sprawled across a lounger.

'Why do people hold their hats like this?' she pondered to her 624,000 followers on Instagram.

Baldwin appeared to be relatively makeup-free for the set snapped outside among luscious landscape.
