Marks and Spencer fans have gone wild for the retailer's new advert capturing a giant Percy Pig cuddly toy being shown how to dive by Olympic medallist Tom Daley.

The British High Street favourite shared the clip on Twitter and Instagram this evening - leaving many shoppers giggling over the bright pink toy and its antics.

However, others used the ad as an opportunity to point out how difficult it was for them to try and find one of the plush Percy Pig toys - which cost £15 for a medium and £25 for a large. 

Tom is joining the likes of Amanda Holden, Rochelle Humes, Emma Willis, Paddy McGuinness and Andi Peters to become a celebrity M&S Food Taster.

'Watching this on a loop #goldforPercy', wrote one impressed viewer, while another said: 'This is so funny'.

A third demanded 'more Percy content,' as a fourth joked: 'Percy really showed [Tom Daley] how it was done.'

At the start of the clip, the toy is seen preparing his diving moves outside of the water - while Tom looks on in fear as the character constantly falls over.

Percy’s first TikTok, which saw the character working in a boardroom and keeping his team motivated, currently has upwards of 300,000 views.

This second clip was posted with the caption: 'Pigs might not fly but can they dive? We couldn’t be more excited to find out and announce the newest member of Team M&S Food: Tom Daley. 







Reaction: Fans of the brand were quick to praise the clip and say how funny they found the advert this evening

However, others used the ad as an opportunity to point out how difficult it was for them to try and find one of the plush Percy Pig toys - which cost £15 for a medium and £25 for a large

'Stay tuned for more from Tom and his very squishable diving partner Percy Pig.'

But some used the ad as an opportunity to share their disappointment at not being able to find one of the cuddly toys - which have reportedly already sold out.

One unimpressed Twitter user said: 'At least Tom can get his hands on one, so hard to find.' 

The teddy is based on M&S's famous Percy Pig sweet which was originally released in 1992 and today sells more than 400 million each year.
