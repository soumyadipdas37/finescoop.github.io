A community outreach worker at a Melbourne safe-injecting clinic has been jailed for drug trafficking.

Matthew Honey's job was to encourage drug users to give up their habit, but he was spreading the drug himself.

He was ordered on Monday to spend 12 months behind bars after admitting he was trafficking heroin in Richmond in September and October last year.

Drug support worker Matthew Honey, 50, (pictured) was convicted of dealing heroin to vulnerable addicts outside Melbourne's controversial safe injecting room 

But Honey appealed the sentence immediately and was freed on bail.

The 50-year-old has been a heroin user since his 20s.

Honey was employed by the clinic as a 'peer worker' to educate drug users about how to use safely, to avoid overdose and encourage addicts to use the safe injecting clinic rather than public places or privately.

He was trained and regularly called to revive people who had overdosed in the street.

'You were distressed as you had attended an inordinate number of overdoses, several involving deaths of people known to you,' magistrate Kieran Gilligan said. 

But he also used his position to traffic drugs to people he knew around the centre, outside a primary school and near his home, which was only a short distance away.

Honey had been a long-time heroin user himself who had gone clean, but then relapsed six months prior to his offending.

He used his work phone to organise a network of heroin users to sell to. 

Using the code name 'Mum', a woman would supply Honey and a co-offender heroin to be sold each day. 

Phone records, along with CCTV and evidence from an undercover police officer, exposed his offending.

'In my view, your offending involved a gross breach of trust because of your employment at the centre and that aggravates your offending,' Magistrate Gilligan said, as quoted in the Herald Sun.

'Your conduct completely undermined and subverted the purposes of the establishment of the facility.' 

The court heard he suffered PTSD and had also been subjected to abuse by 'some sort of local residents' vigilante group'.

Mr Gilligan also noted Honey has previous convictions for violence and dishonesty.

He has been jailed in the past.

His lawyer had asked for a community order, but the magistrate said he had five previous chances at orders and breached four of them.

As part of his bail, Honey must stay off drugs, report daily to police, and cannot go within 50m of the safe injecting room.
