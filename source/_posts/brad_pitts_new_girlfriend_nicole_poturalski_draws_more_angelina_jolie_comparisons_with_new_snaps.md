Poturalski took to her Instagram on Thursday, posting some stylish snaps, wearing a grey Djerf Avenue blazer.

She wore a black crop top exposing her toned midriff under the blazer, completing  her look with a pair of grey jeans that matched her blazer. 

She captioned the snaps, 'See you later' to her 195K Instagram followers on Thursday afternoon.

Pitt took Poturalski to the Chateau Miraval in the South of France, last week, which is where he tied the knot with Jolie in 2014.

The trip also seemed to coincide with Pitt's wedding anniversary, though sources told US Weekly that Pitt doesn't care if fJolie gets upset about it.

'Taking Nicole to Miraval on their former wedding anniversary, Brad knows exactly what he is doing and the reaction it’s going to get from Angelina,' the source said.

'He just doesn’t care if Angelina is going to lash out. He expects she will,' the source added.

Both Pitt and Jolie purchased the estate in 2008, six years before they exchanged vows in the French castle.

The exes are still mired in a lengthy custody battle over their six children - Maddox, 19, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 12 - with the exes expected in court in October.
