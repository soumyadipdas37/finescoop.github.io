She's long been open about her battle with mental health. 

And on Thursday, NRL WAG Zoe Marshall revealed her struggles with anxiety as she penned a moving post for R U OK? Day. 

The 36-year-old shared an old black and white photo of herself crying on Instagram, as she admitted she was at 'breaking point' and 'miserable' earlier this year. 

'One night I just cried and cried': On Thursday, NRL WAG Zoe Marshall admitted she was at 'breaking point' and 'miserable' earlier this year and revealed her battle with anxiety

'This picture was taken in one of the best/worst weeks I've had this year,' Zoe said. 

'I was at breaking point. I was burnt out, being incredibly triggered by something outside of my control and was suffering with circumstantial anxiety. I was miserable.'

She said that at the same time, her podcast was number one, but she just wasn't happy.

'At the same time. I was number one on the podcast charts. It was a real headf**k. I have some people and tools in place when this happens,' she said, revealing she has a therapist, lawyer and acupuncturist who helps her out. 

'I have the best therapist in the world. And one night I just cried and cried, she held that space and reframed some past trauma for me,' Zoe said.

Zoe, who is the wife of NRL star Benji Marshall and who recently revealed she suffered a miscarriage late last year, then urged her followers to talk to others if they need help.

'We are all human. We all struggle and we all have blissful days. It's just about knowing how to feel supported through them all,' Zoe said. 

She finished: 'Please keep talking. And don't be scared of someone's anxiety, mental health, grief and beyond. Be there. Talk. Or just listen. It's more powerful than you realise. And if all else fails call @lifelineaustralia and get some help.' 

In September 2018, Zoe spoke candidly about her struggle with postnatal depression to raise awareness of R U OK? Day.

The mother-of-one wrote on Instagram at the time: 'Today is RUOK day. I have to be honest. Today I am...The two months prior were brutal. Suffering extreme postnatal depletion.' 

She continued the caption, writing that postpartum 'played out in low immunity, constant flu symptoms [and] exhaustion,' adding that she did not take any days off from motherhood or working.

'I tried to keep it together. I tried to smile through it all. I had only time for my baby and work. Everything else fell away. Not talking to anyone about it.'

'I can't believe how happy I finally feel... Was it postnatal depression? I don't know. I do know as a woman and mother I put way to much pressure on myself,' she added.

She also previously admitted she was 'drowning' while trying to juggle motherhood, her media career and life in general.
