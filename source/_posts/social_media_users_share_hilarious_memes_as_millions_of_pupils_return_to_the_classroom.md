Today's reopening of schools for millions across England has been met with excitement, nervousness and a longing for the days of lockdown lie-ins. 

Many children are giddy to be reunited with their classmates for the first time since March, when schools shut as Covid-19 cases snowballed.

But despite assurances from ministers, coronavirus continues to cast a large shadow over the first day back as some parents and staff remain uneasy about the return.

Social media has been flooded with memes making light of the landmark day in the UK's exit from lockdown.

Both genuine and joking messages of support were offered to teachers, who are not only grappling with potential increased exposure, but also having to wake up earlier.

Others poked fun at the extent to which life has changed since schools shuttered, with one comparing the journey to school to an apocalyptic-type scene from ET, and another suggesting a Hazmat suit was the new uniform.

Parents also waded in, with some workers happy they can now go back to the office after providing childcare during lockdown - while others were celebrating a 'child free day'.
