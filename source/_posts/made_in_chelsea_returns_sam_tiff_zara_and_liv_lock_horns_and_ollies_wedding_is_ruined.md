Made In Chelsea returns for its 20th series much like Romeo & Juliet – two households, both alike in dignity. Or perhaps, indignity, is more fitting in this case.

So one house has Freddie, Verity and Amelia in it. They need someone new to spice things up so have shipped in Paris.

Hilton, you ask? Sadly not.

Oh no Zara: Made In Chelsea returns for its 20th series much like Romeo & Juliet – two households, both alike in dignity. Or perhaps, indignity, is more fitting in this case

This Paris is Amelia’s pal and makes potentially the most awkward first appearance of any MIC cast member by accidentally kissing Amelia’s ear on arrival.

It transpires that Verity dumped Tristan during lockdown over the phone. Apparently, it took place during one of the scheduled phone calls that Tristan insisted they had, twice a day, for no less than an hour, which would leave Verity ‘in literal tears’ [as opposed to metonymical ones].

To be honest, if you’re left sobbing into your pillow after speaking to your boyfriend in a world where coronavirus is sweeping the planet and rendering you unable to leave the house, it’s probably best to call it quits anyway.

The girls then compare Tristan to varying types of egg – namely [from nicest to nastiest] poached, scrambled and rotten – which seems a little unfair given that he just fancied a chat during a time when the most exciting thing to do in life was bake banana bread and watch Ozark.

Take that:  Liv chucks a drink at Sam and demands he ‘get the f**k out of this house’ in a spat

The other country manor has got Liv, Tiff, Harvey, Emily, Holmes and Charlie Frederick of Love Island fame in it. Charlie is very much a left-field casting choice but anything goes since they brought in Zara McDermott really.

Charlie isn’t allowed to really speak though and is only there to remind viewers repeatedly that he is a personal trainer and has physically transformed Holmes, who many could be forgiven for not knowing was ever even in the cast to begin with.

This house is a lot more sexually charged – Tiff’s talking about vibrators, Liv says ‘being single is the b******s’, and Emily and Harvey are still enjoying the lusts of young love.

Back in London, Jamie is telling Sam that he and Habbs became sick of each other during lockdown, but that this has only asserted to him that they are soulmates. By this logic, Meghan Markle and Kate Middelton are soulmates, no?

There’s a nasty rumour flying about that Tiff ‘cornered’ Sam at a party like an angry puma and forced him to relive moments of their ‘fiery’ sex life by engaging in lewd, suggestive chat.

Hmm: Zara hasn’t chilled out since she threw a hissy fit at Tiff’s pre-lockdown notebook launch party. She’s wearing an ‘S’ necklace these days, as if she were Anne Boleyn

Tiff insists this did not happen. More on that later.

COVID-19 has ruined Ollie’s plans for an extravagant wedding to Gareth and the stress has turned him ‘gay and grey’.

Sophie seems to have appointed herself as their European wedding planner [like a sexy version of Franck from Father Of The Bride] and wants Ollie to be pulled along a lake by eight swans while Madam Butterfly is played in the background.

Gareth kills this by claiming, ‘I just want to marry him,’ which leaves both Sophie and Ollie turning in their graves [even though they’re not dead].

In case it wasn’t clear, Holmes is into fitness now and Charlie is his personal trainer. Have you got that? Good.

We are reminded of this once more with a scene of them pumping iron outside in the garden. Sorry, but WHERE did these barbells come from and WHO lifts weights on a slanted lawn?

Oh dear: There’s a nasty rumour flying about that Tiff ‘cornered’ Sam at a party like an angry puma and forced him to relive moments of their ‘fiery’ sex life

Liv has her eye on Charlie because these days she ‘likes rough and ready’ rather than a man who’s all ‘oh for God’s sake I’ve left a napkin on the floor’.

Does ANYONE want a man who says that, Liv?

Mark Francis makes his token appearance by inviting Rosi to his newly refurbished house and explaining that his chairs have been constructed using a 70cm loom.

For someone who claims to have taste, there are far too many replica stone statues of Italian men in that house, it has to be said.

Zara hasn’t chilled out since she threw a hissy fit at Tiff’s pre-lockdown notebook launch party. She’s wearing an ‘S’ necklace these days, as if she were Anne Boleyn. But, Anne wore an ‘A’ [her initial], while Zara is wearing an ‘S’ [Sam’s initial], when she really should be wearing a ‘Z’ [her initial] to detract from her possessive tendencies.

Zara says, ‘Tiff's daddy clearly bought her a lot of things, but clearly didn’t buy her morals!’ This from a woman who didn’t want to even hear the name Clive Watson a few months ago.

Wedding bells: Having sought sage advice from Janey Felstead, everyone’s go-to confidante, Gareth tries to tell Ollie that they should forgo the grandeur of a wedding with swans and lakes and opera

Charlie is finally allowed to speak 22 minutes into the episode, muttering something about giving Liv a full body workout. Someone else pipes up and says, ‘more like a lower body work out!’ whilst winking and nudging. All that's needed now is an 'oi, oi!' and we are literally watching TOWIE.

By contrast, the other house are pouring champagne into a top hat. Thank God! This is far more Made In Chelsea. Although we know which property is going to be a-rockin’, and it’s not the top hat house.

Although, Paris does list the qualities she finds attractive in a man and it appears to be Freddie [despite his heinous moustache]. Could this be a romance in the making?

In a strange twist of parallels, OG Fred also has facial hair these days. His is a beard and Sophie’s not a fan. She tells him so while privately watching him play his fiddle.

Melissa has been practicing her OTT facial expressions during lockdown and gives us a few while talking to Zara about Tiff.

‘If Harry’s ex talked about their sex life to him I would literally vomit in my mouth,’ Melissa says, aghast at the rumours about Tiff and Sam’s alleged provocative chat. There’s also a rumour that Tiff phoned Sam at 3AM the other night in the style of a booty call, at which Melissa is equally appalled.

Having sought sage advice from Janey Felstead, everyone’s go-to confidante, Gareth tries to tell Ollie that they should forgo the grandeur of a wedding with swans and lakes and opera.

He attempts to get this message across by making him a meal of snails and chunky chips [the opposite of non-grand] and Ollie is still having none of it.

The two country houses combine for a pool party at the sex house, and Sam is encircled by bikini-clad Liv, Zara and Tiff, who try to hash out the details of this alleged encounter between Sam and Tiff.

Happier times: Sam and Zara have since gone their separate ways 

Needless to say this ends in disaster when Liv chucks a drink at Sam and demands he ‘get the f**k out of this house’.

Verity and Tristan try to clear the air and it goes like this: ‘How do you feel?’ ‘I don’t know how I feel!’ ‘How DO you feel?’ ‘I don’t know!’

So that’s that sorted.

Meanwhile, the girls discuss Melissa and accuse her of playing Zara and Tiff off against each other much like Fred plays his fiddle.

Liv then plays Zara a voice note that Melissa sent Tiff in which she calls Zara a ‘fame w***e’. Zara is absolutely appalled at the nastiness of all these girls. Of course, it has since come out that she cheated on Sam while doing The X Factor, but for the purpose of dramatic effect, let’s pretend we don’t know that yet, shall we?

Made In Chelsea continues at 9PM on E4 next Monday.

No way: Liv then plays Zara a voice note that Melissa sent Tiff in which she calls Zara a ‘fame w***e’. Zara is absolutely appalled at the nastiness of all these girls
