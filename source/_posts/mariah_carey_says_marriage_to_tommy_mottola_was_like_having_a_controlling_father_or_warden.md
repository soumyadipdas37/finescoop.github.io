As she gears up to release her memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey, the star has opened up about her marriage to Tommy Mottola like never before. 

In an upcoming interview with CBS Sunday Morning, the 50-year-old star said her marriage to the music executive was 'like having a completely controlling father or warden.' 

The couple was married from 1993 until 1998 after he discovered her in the late 1980s when he was then head of Columbia Records.

The Hero hitmaker recalled a moment during her marriage to Mottola when she decided to leave their house with rapper Da Brat, who she was collaborating on an Always Be my Baby remix with, alongside Jermaine Dupri and Xscape. 

But at the time, even a simple outing caused 'huge drama,' she said. 

'I was like, yeah, let's go for a ride because it was normal for most people to just leave their house and go literally five minutes down the street to get French fries or just take a ride,' she said. 

Adding: 'But it became a huge drama.'

'You have to laugh at it. At the time, it wasn't funny. But in retrospect, was it worth it? Couldn't you just have let me go,' she said of her ex. 

Her new tell-all memoir book will be released on September 29. 

Recently during a Cosmopolitan interview last year she dished that she has only been with five men and shed some light on her first marriage.  

'You might want to picture a child bride,' she said of her dynamic with Mottola, who was more than two decades her senior.

'There was a conscious effort to keep me as this all-American, whatever that means, girl. It was very controlled. There was no ­freedom for me as a human being. It was almost like being a prisoner,' said Carey.

From 2008 until 2016 she was married to Nick Cannon, with whom she amicably co-parents her nine-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan.

After that divorce she had a failed engagement to Australian billionaire James Packer and is now dating her former backup dancer Bryan Tanaka.
