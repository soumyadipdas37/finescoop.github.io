Misogyny should be made a hate crime punishable by up to seven years in jail, Government legal advisers said yesterday.

The Law Commission said crimes should carry harsher punishments if they were committed by someone motivated by a hatred of women.

Under plans to improve hate crime laws, the commission also proposed the long sentence for anyone convicted for stirring up hatred against transgender people.

The proposal that sex or gender should be made a legally ‘protected characteristic’ – such as race, religious belief or disability – followed prompts from ministers who want to see a reform of hate crime law. 

The NHS has launched a review into gender identity services for children and teenagers amid concerns about the country’s only clinic.

The Tavistock Centre’s service in Central London has been criticised for fast-tracking youths into life-changing decisions without assessing their personal histories.

The NHS launched an inquiry into gender-altering drugs in February, but this will examine the whole care of the child.

The review will be overseen by the former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Dr Hilary Cass, who is aiming for a series of recommendations next year.

 

The Commission also called for laws to criminalise homophobic chants or racist gestures at football matches, and advocated for an extension of victim groups to include the homeless, sex workers and ‘alternative subcultures’ such as goths.

But it sidelined plans to include older people as having ‘protected characteristics’. 

Despite prompts from ministers, it said hate crime against those targeted because of their age would not yet be outlawed. 

The proposals followed calls from ministers under Theresa May for a re-think of hate crime law.

Criminal Law Commissioner Professor Penney Lewis said the proposals mean ‘women enjoy hate crime protection for the first time’. 

The report said hate crime laws are based on legislation dating back to 1986, and that stirring up hatred is an offence in itself which can bring a maximum seven-year prison sentence. 

It now wants all protected characteristics to be among those for which people can be convicted for stirring up hatred.

The consultation lasts until Christmas and may form the basis of new legislation next year.

Ministers formally rejected calls for people to be allowed to change their legal gender without a medical diagnosis yesterday.

Women and Equalities Minister Liz Truss said gender self-recognition was ‘not the top priority’ for transgender people. 

She claimed the existing 2004 Gender Recognition Act provides ‘proper checks’ while still supporting those who want to change their legal gender.
