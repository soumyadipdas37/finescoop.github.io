A grieving mum has slammed a court's decision to allow her son's accused killer to walk free on bail because he refused to sleep in a prison cell alone.  

Thomas Tran, 20, was allegedly stabbed in his heart by Lindim Aliti, 18, during a gang attack at a shopping strip in Oakleigh, in Melbourne's southeast in June.

Victoria's Supreme Court released Mr Aliti on $600,000 bail this week after lawyers argued he could die from his epilepsy if he were to stay alone in his cell. 

The court heard he had always slept in the same room as his brother or grandfather, who could intervene if he had potentially-fatal seizure. 

Thomas' mother Amie Tran said her heart was 'broken' after hearing her son's alleged murderer had been released

Thomas' mother Amie Tran said her heart was 'broken' after hearing her son's alleged murderer had been released.

'It's not fair. I'm not happy at all,' Ms Tran told A Current Affair.

Mr Tran's girlfriend of two years Trisha Nguyen said the decision was unfair and insulting to his family.  

'How their side is saying that he could possibly die in custody is really insensitive to our situation,' Ms Nguyen said.

'We didn't want to lose Thomas in that way ever. His parents will never get a change to ever have grandkids.'

Ms Nguyen said her boyfriend had dreams of becoming a personal trainer, and was 'really a good person'.

'He was the biggest goofball,' she said.

Mr Aliti's defence barrister Robert Richter QC, who defended Cardinal George Pell, said Mr Aliti's age, good record and medical condition meant should be bailed.

'The prison conditions that don't allow him to see his family... his whole life has been in residence with his siblings, his parents and his grandparents,' he said.

Former Chief Magistrate Nick Papas QC said Mr Aliti's while it is rare, those accused of murder can be released on bail.

'Exceptional circumstances need to be shown,' he said.

The judge ruled that was the case, imposing strict conditions to manage any risk.

Mr Aliti must work at a Dandenong South factory and he is banned from parts of Oakleigh where the incident occurred.

His grandfather has entered a surety of $600,000.

Hee will return to court in December.
