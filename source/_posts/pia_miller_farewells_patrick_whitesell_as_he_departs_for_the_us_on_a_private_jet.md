Pia Miller was finally reunited with her multi-millionaire American talent agent boyfriend Patrick Whitesell, last week. 

But on Friday, the former Home and Away actress, 36, had to bid Patrick goodbye as he flew back to the US on a private jet. 

Pia and Patrick, 55, were spotted shopping at Woolworths in Double Bay, one of the richest suburb in Sydney, on Friday morning.

She cut a summery look in a flowy green dress from Auguste The Label, which featured a thigh-high split.

The wrap-around frock loosely skimmed the beauty's figure, with a V-neck cut showing off a hint of her cleavage. 

Meanwhile, Patrick wore Nike Jordans, black jeans and a grey shirt with a 'Loyola Football' graphic emblazoned across the chest. 

 Time to say goodbye: After their trip to Woolworths, the couple headed to a Sydney private jet base where a Gulfstream jet was waiting for Patrick

Loyola is actually Pia's surname, although she is commonly known as Miller, which she adopted from her AFL ex Brad Miller, with whom she split from in 2015. 

After their trip to Woolworths, the couple headed to a Sydney private jet base where a Gulfstream jet was waiting for Patrick. 

The smitten couple then said there goodbyes before he boarded the flight to fly back to the US.    

Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, Pia and Patrick had been apart for months before reuniting in Sydney last week.

P for perfect! Pia posted a selfie to Instagram captioned 'Two Ps in a pod' to announce they had been reunited, while also playing on the fact both of their names start with 'P'

The couple were spotted going on a romantic date to the Dolphin Hotel in Surry Hills and going on a shopping trip in the Sydney CBD. 

Patrick was also played basketball with Pia's youngest son Lennox, 13, in Sydney on Tuesday.

Pia shares Lennox with her ex-husband and former AFL player, Brad. She's also mother to son Isaiah, 16, who she gave birth to when she was nineteen.
