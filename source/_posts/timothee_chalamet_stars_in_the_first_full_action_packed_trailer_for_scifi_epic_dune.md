Dune was written by Frank Herbert in 1965 and was named in 2003 as the best-selling science-fiction novel of all time, which follows Paul Atreides, the son of a noble family entrusted with protecting the most valuable element in the galaxy.

It was previously adapted into the 1984 feature film of the same name by writer-director David Lynch, starring Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides.

There was also a 2000 mini-series adaptation that starred William Hurt. 

This new Dune adaptation is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival), from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth (Munich) and Jon Spaihts (Doctor Strange).

The cast also includes Stellan Skarsgard, David Dastmalchian, Charlotte Rampling, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Sharon Duncan-Brewster and Chen Chang.

Warner Bros. has set a December 18 release date for Dune, though it's possible that may change amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
