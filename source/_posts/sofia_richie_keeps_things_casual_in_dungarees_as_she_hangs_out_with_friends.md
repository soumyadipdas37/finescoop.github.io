She has been enjoying single life since her on/off relationship with Scott Disick came to an official end last month. 

And Sofia Ritchie looked in great spirits as she spent time with friends at her beach house in Malibu on Wednesday. 

Keeping things casual in a pair of dungarees, the 22-year-old model looked effortlessly stylish on the outing.

Sheathing her sensational figure, Sofia opted for loose fitting overalls that she rolled up at the hems to show off her white sneakers. 

Layering up, she donned a plain white T-shirt and accessorised with a dainty gold necklace and stack of bangles.

Sweeping her ombre locks away from her face, Sofia showcased her flawless features, which were enhanced with a neutral makeup palette.

Sofia's outing comes after her ex-boyfriend Scott, 37, admitted he wants another child with Kourtney Kardashian, 41. 

The on/off exes have been spending plenty of time together following Scott's split from Sofia, with fans wondering if they've reconciled. 

A new 'supertease' for season 19 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, did little to quell the rumours, as talk turned to the pair's complicated relationship.

Ahead of the show's return on September 17,  a clip saw the exes asked by Kim Kardashian if they are trying to have a fourth child. 

They are already parents to Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five. 

Kim is seen in a crochet top by a swimming pool as she says, 'Scott's like we're going for baby number four, is that serious I want to know.'

The faces of Kourtney, Khloe and Scott are all flashed as they appear to be at a family lunch on a patio of a mansion. 

'Are you pregnant?' another voice is heard asking Kourtney, who looks put on the spot and not happy about it. Her answer is not heard.  

Kourtney and Scott started dating in 2006 after meeting at Joe Francis' house in Mexico and in 2007 he became a fixture on KUWTK. 

They were on and off for years as Scott was accused many times of cheating on his partner; and checked into rehab multiple times before they called it quits in July 2015.
