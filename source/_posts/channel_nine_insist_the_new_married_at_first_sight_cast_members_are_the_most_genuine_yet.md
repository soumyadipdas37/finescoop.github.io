Producers started casting for the new season of Married At First Sight in February.

And during Nine's Upfronts on Wednesday, the network insisted the cast members for season eight of the dating show are 'the most genuine yet'.

Channel Nine also claimed the new season will be about 'finding love not fame' as all the contestants are determined to find their potential match.

The new season will also star Alessandra Rampolla, a certified clinical sexologist with over 20 years' experience, who will join the show as an expert.

'I am thrilled to be joining John and Mel in Australia's biggest social experiment,' she said.

Alessandra added: 'With my particular expertise, I hope to contribute to the complex mix of components that ensure marriages not only work but thrive in the long haul.'

Meanwhile, producers were criticised for casting wannabe celebrities over everyday Australians for last year's season of MAFS.

After leaving the show, Mishel Karen was snapped up by a PR agency and effortlessly transitioned into a new job as a social media influencer. 

Michael Goonan also confirmed rumours he went on the show for fame during an interview on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O show.

'It's for three months. I put the clown suit on for Australia. I dressed up and I juggled, do you know what I mean?' he said.

Operations manager Mikey Pembroke had also been on television in the past, making his acting debut on ABC miniseries Friday on My Mind.

Meanwhile, Amanda Micallef now has a StarNow profile where she advertises herself as an 'actor, extra, model and TV/radio presenter' looking for work.
