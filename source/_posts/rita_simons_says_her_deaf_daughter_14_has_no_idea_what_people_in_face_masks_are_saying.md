Rita Simons has revealed it 'breaks her heart' that her deaf daughter has 'no idea' what people in face masks are saying - because it prevents her from being able to lip read.

Taking to Twitter, the former EastEnders star, 43, penned: 'Masks, not denying the need for them...All I know is my deaf daughter has no idea what anyone is saying as she can't lip read a person in a mask...but we all wear ours anyway. Breaks my heart a little bit for her.'

And it wasn't long before the post, which garnered 8, 700 likes, was inundated with messages of support from her 396, 000 followers. 

'Maybe it’s time for us all to put an effort into learning sign language,' wrote one. 'It must be so lonely and isolating for deaf people right now when their only connection to a person is watching their lips move.'

Rita's daughter Maiya, 14, was diagnosed at six-months-old of being profoundly deaf in her right ear and limited hearing in her left ear

The former EastEnders star took to Twitter and penned: 'Masks, not denying the need for them...All I know is my deaf daughter has no idea what anyone is saying as she can't lip read a person in a mask...but we all wear ours anyway. Breaks my heart a little bit for her' (pictured)

A second added: 'Masks with a clear bit of plastic around the mouth need to be introduced or made more known about to make it easier for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.'

'There are a few places I believe that you can get these masks from. Hopefully people will start knowing about them more!'

Rita's daughter Maiya was diagnosed at six-months-old of being profoundly deaf in her right ear and limited hearing in her left ear.

Maiya, who has a twin called Jaimee without any hearing impairments, underwent a cochlear implant operation aged six which enabled her to hear in both ears.

Last year, Rita shared an incredible video of the then 13-year-old performing Spotlight from Everybody's Talking About Jamie, which Rita starred in as Miss Hedge.

She captioned it: 'I don't normally put too many pics of my kids on social media but I am going against my rule this to show all you parents of deaf kids out there that #cochlearimplant CAN change your child's life.

Rita's post was quickly inundated with messages of support from her social media followers (pictured)

'Maiya is almost profoundly deaf. Without her processor she hears nothing. She was implanted 6 yrs ago and this was her last night singing a song from the show I'm in right now #everybodystalkingaboutjamie #ProudMama. 

In 2012, when Maiya was just six-years-old, she underwent a cochlear implant operation, which involves a small hearing devices fitted under the skin behind the ear, otherwise she would go completely deaf.

The implants cannot restore normal hearing but they can give a deaf person a good representation of sounds, helping them understand speech.

Talking about the procedure before her daughter had it, Rita told Hello! Magazine: 'The hostility we've encountered has been extraordinary. It comes mainly from people who firmly believe that deafness should be embraced rather than treated as a physical deficiency that should be corrected.

'I totally respect their point of view. But when a 19-year-old girl told me that I was an 'abuser' to let my child have a cochlear implant, I was horrified and deeply hurt.'

Rita admitted that she bawled her eyes out after doctors broke the news about Maiya's hearing at six-months-old and she was fitted with a hearing aid at eight-months-old.

The star revealed that she had to accept that her 'daughter is deaf' but insisted that she would treat Maiya the exact same as her twin sister Jaimee and that they decided to get the cochlear implant to give her the 'gift of sound'.

She added: 'We've brought Maiya up as a hearing child, and she attends the same mainstream school as her twin sister.'

Rita rose to fame as Roxy Mitchell on EastEnders until she was dramatically killed off on the New Year's Day special in 2017.
