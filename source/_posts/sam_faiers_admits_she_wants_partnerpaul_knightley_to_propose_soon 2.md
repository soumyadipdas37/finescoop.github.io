Christine Lampard is back hosting Lorraine this week after some time out, and her stylish wardrobe has also returned. 

The presenter is wearing the 'Luella' dress by Ghost that's designed with the brand's signature midi silhouette, high neck and puff sleeves. Think you recognise it? Well, that's because Holly Willoughby donned the dress back in June. 

The best bit, however, has to be the pineapple print that scatters the dress and is created with linear detailing and blocks of colour. A total statement!

Fortunately, if you're heading back to work you can shop Christine's dress for yourself via the link (right).

The former TOWIE star also revealed that fans will get to see a different side to partner Paul on the new series and that he is usually 'camera shy'.

She continued: 'Five years later, he's starting to be a bit more comfortable on camera, you see a new side, really confident, nice for people to see the real Paul. He's a little bit camera shy, I suppose.'

Talking about how their relationship has coped in lockdown, Sam admitted that it has been really good and they have cherished the family time.

She said: 'I just think we cherished the time, life is such a whirlwind. We're always busy with the kids and working, it's nice to break for a minute with no commitments apart from the children.

Eek! To which she admitted: I hope so - two kids, five years, two big moves together. I hope so soon!'

Her love: Sam and Paul started dating in 2014 and they have two children - Paul Jr, four, and Rosie, two  

'Give them attention, let's use this time, it won't happen again. We actually really enjoyed it!'   

Sam recently moved away from her mother Suzie Wells and sister Billie to Surrey, talking about the new location she said: 'We love it here, we always wanted to be in Surrey, Hertfordshire was just a stepping stone.

'We took a leap and we are here. My mum and sister can see how happy we are, so they're happy for us.' 

And it's a time of change for the family as Sam revealed that their son Paul Jr, four, is starting school this week. The couple famously had a row about sending him to nursery on The Mummy Diaries where they disagreed about the decision.

Memories! Talking about her plans for their future wedding, she added that she wants the youngsters as part of the day

Back to it! Sam and sister Billie also posed for some fun pictures in a red telephone box (L-R) 

Talking about the milestone, Sam said: 'I am really excited, I think I'm going to cry my eyes out, but he's going to really love it.'  

Teasing the upcoming series, she added: 'Don't worry, we haven't hidden anything. There's still tantrums, tears and drama. It was filmed during lockdown and our move to Surrey!'

Talk also turned turned to the TOWIE 10-year anniversary, which will be celebrated in September with special reunion episodes.  

Speaking of her time on the ITVBe show, Sam said: 'I was 19 when I started the show, 29 now, to think ten years ago, is insane. 

Growing up: Sam revealed that their son Paul Jr, four, is starting school this week. The couple famously had a row about sending him to nursery on The Mummy Diaries where they disagreed about the decision (Paul pictured walking cousin Nelly to school)  

'Ten year anniversary, I am going to be getting involved, not on the show but looking back at the best bits.

'It was a huge part of my life, what was funny about it, we had nothing to lose - 19, no children, just fun. When I look back we actually had fun.' 

In the past, the star revealed that she and partner Paul are constantly pressurised by fans to get married, but they don't let the comments bother them. 

Emotional: Talking about the milestone, Sam said: 'I am really excited, I think I'm going to cry my eyes out, but he's going to really love it.'

Sam told MailOnline: 'I actually don't [feel pressurised]. I know everyone asks all the time, especially since Billie and Greg got married - it's been more heightened. It's really not top of my priorities. 

'I always say to Paul, he's not anyway, but I always say: "Don't every feel pressure" and he's like "No, I don't." 

'I do look forward to when it does happen as it will be a whole new chapter for our lives. I don't mind that it's not happening right now as I'm really busy and I've got it to look forward to. 

Claim to fame: Talk also turned turned to the TOWIE 10-year anniversary, which will be celebrated in September with special reunion episodes (Sam pictured with sister Billie in 2011)

'We've just done Billie and Greg's wedding, a big build up, so that was epic then I think we've got it all again to come. I think I'm alright holding off for a bit, it's exciting times ahead.'

And when asked whether she would ever document her wedding on the series, Sam admitted: 'I haven't even thought about it, personally for me, it’s part of my life, I’ve done it forever.

'I don’t know, it’s just Paul… whether it’s a decision Paul and I would have to make together.' 

Lorraine continues on weekdays at 9am on ITV. 

She's back! Sam said: 'Ten year anniversary, I am going to be getting involved, not on the show but looking back at the best bits.'
