Johanna Konta has split from coach Thomas Hogstedt and is out of the Italian Open after a third-round loss to Garbine Muguruza.

The British No 1, who reached the final in Rome last year in a breakthrough performance on clay, has had a number of close battles with Muguruza in the past but this was much more straightforward for the Spaniard, who came through 6-4, 6-1

Swede Hogstedt is one of the most experienced coaches on the WTA Tour, having previously worked with illustrious names like Maria Sharapova and Caroline Wozniacki.

Johanna Konta went down 6-4, 6-1 against Spaniard Garbine Muguruza in Rome on Friday

The partnership raised a few eyebrows, with former British No 1 Laura Robson describing it as a 'very weird choice' because of their respective personalities.

Konta batted that away but appears to have concluded that they are not the right fit after all.

A spokesman for Konta said: 'They were only working on a trial basis and they agreed to work together for the US swing and then assess going forward.'

Under Hogstedt, the British No 1 reached the semi-finals of the Western & Southern Open before losing in the second round of the US Open.

She will now begin preparations for the French Open, which begins on September 27.
