A 'Coffin Confessor' who gets paid thousands to gatecrash funerals at the request of the dead has revealed the most outrageous things he's had to tell grieving relatives.

Bill Edgar was a private investigator until an elderly man asked him to step in at his funeral three years ago to call out his best friend for 'trying to screw' his wife.

The Gold Coast man has since made a thriving business divulging his dead clients' explosive secrets to their heartbroken families during burials and will readings. 

Speaking on the Kyle and Jackie O show on Tuesday, Mr Edgar - whose clients pay up to $10,000 for his services - revealed his most shocking confessions.

'I've exposed family secrets, sexual affairs and intimate relationships between brothers and sisters,' he told the stunned hosts.

Mr Edgar said his worst job was when he had to reveal a girlfriend had slept with her partner's mother and father.

'Basically, there weren't many people left at the funeral,' he said. 

Another request involved telling the family of a bikie gang member that he was gay and his lover was in the crowd.

'Half a dozen people left, a couple gave me the finger and told me that I was going to get bashed, but the majority said, "we know what he was like, and we knew".'

To avoid gatecrashing funerals with false assumptions and accusations, Mr Edgar uses his private investigation skills to verify his clients' claims.

'I've got to get some actual facts too - I've got to look in to it. I can't just go to a funeral and announce bullsh**t, it's got to be legitimate stuff.'

Along with airing people's dirty laundry, Mr Edgar spends most of his time purging his dead clients' homes of embarrassing items to spare their families the discomfort (stock image of a funeral)

Along with airing people's dirty laundry, Mr Edgar spends most of his time purging his dead clients' homes of embarrassing items to spare their families the discomfort. 

One customer was an 88-year-old man from Toowoomba in Queensland who asked the coffin confessor to clean his attic.

'He said "you're going to find some items in there that are going to shock you"'.

'I got in the attic and there's a sex swing, there's toys - you name it, it was there.' 

Mr Edgar explained that he never has to ask his clients questions about their seemingly bizarre secrets because 'they divulge everything ... they've got nothing to lose'.

Some clients have also used his services to confess to crimes.

While he is obliged to report admissions to the police, Mr Edgar skirts around the problem by asking the person write confession down in a letter and address it to themselves.

The coffin confessor picks the unopened letter up after the client dies and places it in a drawer and leaves it there.

'It's illegal to open someone else's mail,' he said.

Other strange requests come from clients who want want to be buried with specific items, such as money, firearms, and mobile phones with torches because they're scared of the dark.

Some ask for glass coffins, caskets filled with water or fitted with speakers programmed to make screaming sounds as it's lowered into the ground. 

Bill Edgar has also been asked to prick some clients in the arm with a pin before the burial to make sure they're really dead

'One person wanted their coffin to be upside-down, on top of their wife's coffin, in the 69 position,' he said.

He has also been asked to prick some clients in the arm with a pin before the burial to make sure they're really dead.

To use the coffin confessor's services, dying clients must sign a contract giving Mr Edgar the right to call the service off and take the body away if the family try to stop him from doing his job.

They are also asked to video themselves giving Mr Edgar permission to carry out their final wishes.

When asked whether he feels guilty about slapping upset friends and family members with shocking details during a vulnerable time, he said: 'I'm not respecting the living.' 

'My clients are dead and I like them more than the people who are alive.'

But the messages Mr Edgar shares aren't always of vengeance and resentment, The Gold Coast Bulletin previously reported.

Once a month, he sends a letter to a man telling him that his wife loves him and will never forget him, at the dead woman's request. 

The Coffin Confessor previously told Daily Mail Australia he was once asked by a man dying from pancreatic cancer to euthanize his dog so it could be with him 'in heaven'.

'His instructions were that he wanted to take his dog with him, and he wanted someone to take his dog's life so they could be together in heaven,' he said.  

Despite Mr Edgar saying he would jump at every opportunity if it paid, he draws the line in assisting with death, saying it's something he would never do. 

A more morbid case Mr Edgar was faced with came from a man on his death bed with pancreatic cancer, whose dying wish was to have his beloved pet dog die with him

Although Mr Edgar's intrusions at funerals are often met with hostility from mourners, some of his clients' family members actually thank him for his help.

'I had the daughter of a man that died came up to me and said her dad would be so proud that you told his brother and sister-in-law to "f**k off",' he said.

Mr Edgar said at this particular funeral he even improvised and added in a few choice words of his own. 

He also had three separate requests in one week from people who asked him to dress up as Homer Simpson for their funeral. 

'I think it's for more of a themed-funeral, it's more lighthearted. I guess people pick their idol and want me to surprise everyone,' he said. 

Some to wonder if he could simply not fulfill his client's wishes and pocket the cash after they die.

'My clients say to me "look I'm paying you this money, if you rip me off I won't know but I'll see you one day in heaven",' he said.
