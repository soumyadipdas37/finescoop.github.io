Juventus 'want to bring Moise Kean back to the club' after the striker endured a difficult first season at Everton.

The 20-year-old signed for the Toffees last summer in a Â£25million deal but struggled to make an impact.

Italy international Kean started just six Premier League matches and scored only two goals.

Juventus 'want to bring Moise Kean back from Everton' after the striker struggled in England

Kean scored a penalty in Everton's 3-0 Carabao Cup win over Salford City in midweek

He was on target from the penalty spot, however, as Everton beat League Two side Salford City in the Carabao Cup last week.

The low point was reached when interim manager Duncan Ferguson substituted him just 19 minutes after bringing him on against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

However, according to goal.com, former club Juventus want to offer Kean an escape route and get his career back on track.

They report that the Italian champions wish to sign Kean on loan without an obligation to buy.

Everton though would like to include such an obligation in any deal or sell the striker outright.

It was at Juventus that Kean developed into one of the most exciting young players in European football.

He broke through during the second half of the 2018-19 season, scoring six Serie A goals in six matches.

That made Everton's purchase of him last summer look like a genuine coup but the striker has struggled on Merseyside.

Back in November, Kean's father admitted the Everton move was a 'mistake' and blamed the player's agent Mino Raiola and his own ex-wife.
