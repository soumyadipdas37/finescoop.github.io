Borussia Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre has confirmed that Jadon Sancho will be staying at the Bundesliga club amid interest from Manchester United.

The England international winger is being chased by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side this summer but the Red Devils missed Dortmund's August 10 deadline to finalise a deal for the player.

And Favre, who has managed Sancho for the last two season, has joined Dortmund's players and sporting directors in confirming the 20-year-old's stay at the club, though claims he is not the finished article yet.

The Dortmund boss told Keystone-SDA: 'We need him, no question. Everyone was happy that he stayed. 

'We don't need to talk long about its qualities – they are enormous. He scores and sets up a lot of goals and can often make all the difference. 

'But there are some details that Sancho needs to improve. That is quite normal for a 20-year-old.' 

The 2020-21 Bundesliga season starts again on Friday and Sancho will be hoping he can match or even better his goals and assists tally from last season.

The England star scored 17 goals and laid on 16 more for his team-mates as Dortmund finished as Bundesliga runners-up to Bayern Munich.  

He is set to be part of a devastating front line for the Bundesliga giants alongside forward Erling Braut Haaland, Thorgan Hazard and Julian Brandt.

Meanwhile, Favre also has another promising young Englishman at his disposal as Jude Bellingham is set to embark on his debut campaign in Germany.

The 17-year-old joined Dortmund from Birmingham in a £25million transfer this summer and Favre cannot wait to see him in the middle of the park in the German top-flight.

He added: 'Of course, I'm looking forward to a player like him. I got to know him better during the preparation. 

'I like how he handles the ball and how he can defend it. Jude possesses many tactical options and an amazing presence. 

'He can play as a six or eight, plays good passes, seeks completion. Various systems are possible with him. It's all very, very interesting.'
