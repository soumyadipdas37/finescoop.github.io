Donald Trump claimed that he was 'genetically' capable of understanding nuclear weapons - because his uncle was a physicist.

The President told North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that he knew about his nuclear test sites 'better than any of my people' because his uncle Dr. John Trump taught at MIT.

But Dr. Trump's expertise was electrical engineering and there is no indication that Trump sought him out as a tutor.

Trump also claimed that he does not need to be black to understand their point of view and can 'fully understand' their perspective - even though he is white.

The extraordinary anecdotes are in 'Rage' the new book about Trump by Bob Woodward, the former Washington Post journalist who exposed the Watergate scandal in the Richard Nixon administration.

Journalist Bob Woodward claims in his new book 'Rage' that Trump told Kim Jong-un that he was 'genetically' capable of understanding nuclear weapons during the historic 2018 summit

Trump reportedly said he was 'genetically' capable  because his uncle Dr. John Trump (pictured) was a physicist. The president said: 'He was at MIT for 42 years or something. He was great - so I understand that stuff. You know, genetically'

The book has sparked outrage after Trump admitted to Woodward in March that he played down the threat of the coronavirus.

'Rage' is out on Tuesday but DailyMail.com obtained a copy ahead of publication.

In the book, Trump recounts to Woodward his historic summit with Kim in Singapore in 2018.

Trump said when it came to denuclearization, he told Kim: 'I know every one of your sites better than any of my people'.

Trump told Woodward that the reason was because of his uncle who was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1983.

Trump said: 'He was at MIT for 42 years or something. He was great - so I understand that stuff. You know, genetically'.

During one of his 18 interviews with Woodward the discussion turned to the protests about racial inequality sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.

Trump says: 'I don't have to be black to understand the black point of view.

'I don't have to have gone through personal slavery in order to understand the horrible atrocity that people have suffered.

'You don't have to. You know, I don't have to put myself in that position. I can fully understand it without being in that position'.

Woodward writes that Trump claimed he saved Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from congressional scrutiny after the brutal assassination of the American journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Washington Post journalist Khashoggi, 59, was dismemebered in the Saudi consulate in Istabul in October 2018.

The CIA concluded that bin Salman, who is known as MBS, personally ordered his killing.

Trump said of MBC: 'I saved his a**.

'I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to get them to stop'.

Asked by Woodward if he believes MBS when he says he didn't order the killing, Trump said: 'No, he says that he didn't do it'.

The book paints Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, as a shadowy figure who understands Trump better than anyone else.

Yet Woodward makes clear he was not capable of dealing with the multitude of issues given to him to oversee, including the Middle East peace agreement.

Kusher told former secretary of state Rex Tillerson that 'if you make the economic benefits big enough' the Palestinians would agree to a deal.

Woodward writes: 'Money was the key, just pump money. Trump talked that way too'.

Tillerson told Kusher: 'These people are not going to care about your money. Or they'll take your money and five years from now you'll be right back where you are today'.

Tillerson found watching Kushner move forward with his plan was 'nauseating...stomach churning'.

Not that Kushner seemed bothered and he told Woodward that 'this isn't my career'.

By the time he leaves Washington this will be just a 'tour of duty' and he will be on to something else - with no apparent interest in public service element of his job.

Jared Kusher told former secretary of state Rex Tillerson that 'if you make the economic benefits big enough' the Palestinians would agree to a deal, according to the book 

In 2017 on a visit to Israel, its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a video of his Palestinian equivalent Mahmoud Abbas manipulated to make it look like he was 'ordering the murder of children'.

The anecdotes will be released on Tuesday when 'Rage' hits shelves

Woodward's sources make clear that the video was obviously fake but Trump thought it was real.

The next morning Trump met privately with Abbas and screamed at him: 'Murderer! Liar! I thought you were this grandfatherly figure that I could trust. Now I realize you're nothing but a murderer. You tricked me!'

'Rage' rakes over the Mueller investigation and its aftermath and includes a revealing story from Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the President.

Graham told Trump that if he colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election then he couldn't serve as President.

Trump said: 'I've done a lot of bad things, but I didn't do this'.

Graham replied: 'I believe you on both counts'.

Attorney General William Barr was so surprised when he read the summary of Mueller's findings he called Graham to give him the heads-up.

The report left it to Barr to decide if Trump should face a criminal prosecution and said it could not rule out him obstructing justice.

Barr said: 'You're not going to believe this. After two f****** years he (Mueller) says: ''I don't know, you decide''.

Among the extracts of 'Rage' already made public are the President admitting to Woodward on February 7th this year that he knew the coronavirus was deadlier than flu and that it could travel through the air.

Yet publicly Trump insisted that the threat was low and that that virus would 'disappear'.

Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden has called Trump's admission 'nearly criminal' and 'disgusting'.

Among the other revelations in the book are letters between Trump and Kim who flatters him by calling the President 'Your Excellency'.

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis goes on the record to say that Trump was 'dangerous and unfit for office'.

Trump also lets slip during one of his interviews with Woodward that America has a secret weapons system but does not elaborate.
