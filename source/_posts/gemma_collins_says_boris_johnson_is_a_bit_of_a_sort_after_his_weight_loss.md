Gemma Collins has revealed she has developed a bit of a crush on Boris Johnson, following his weight loss. 

The Diva Forever star, 39, made the revelation as she discussed how controversial £250 Skinny Jabs have helped her shed three stone.   

Talking to PlayOJO bingo, Gemma said: 'I use Skinny Jabs – it's a programme that I am on and I have managed to lost 3 stone on it.

'He's a bit of a sort!': Gemma Collins has revealed she has developed a bit of a crush on Boris Johnson, following his weight loss

'It is a full programme, you get nutrition advice, nice recipes and guidance and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to lose weight.'

The television personality has previously come under fire for promoting the jab, which 'regulate the glucose level in your blood, allowing your body to use your stored fat for energy'.

This means that you can safely consume small portions without experiencing the undesired effects of starvation mode.'

Well done: The Prime Minister, 56, has lost at least a stone in weight and has enlisted the help of a trainer after recovering from coronavirus (left in October, right on a run on Wednesday)

Gemma continued: 'My advice to anyone looking to start a weight loss journey would be adopt the right mindset. 

'I believe that all bodies are beautiful, but if you want to make a change its really powerful to do it from a health-first perspective.'

Of her crush on Boris, the reality star said: 'It'd really encouraging to see Boris taking action to tackle the issue of obesity in our country.   

Health: Talking to PlayOJO bingo, after playing bingo caller in Manchester (pictured), Gemma said: 'I use Skinny Jabs – it's a programme that I am on and I have managed to lost 3 stone on it'

'Boris has lost some weight himself recently – I saw him on the news the other day with his weight loss and his holiday tan and I thought "Boris looks a bit of a sort". 

'Bless you Boris – losing weight will make anyone feel better.'

The Prime Minister, 56, has lost at least a stone in weight and has enlisted the help of a personal trainer after recovering from coronavirus.  

Earlier this month, Gemma furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her as she was 'too fat'. 

Talking about TOWIE's 10th anniversary, she said: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body.

Trim: 'I believe that all bodies are beautiful, but if you want to make a change its really powerful to do it from a health-first perspective', Gemma said (pictured over summer) 

'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.

'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand. So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?' 

Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.

She went onto share the video with her fans on Instagram, writing the caption: 'Thank you SO MUCH No 1 I.C.O.N. 

'The show holds such dear memories for me and I will never forget that if it wasn't for TOWIE I would not be where I am today!! 

'I love the fans so much and here's to another wonderful ten years of TOWIE i love you all the TOWIE fans and just remember BE YOU ✌ thank you TOWIE and congrats to all.'
