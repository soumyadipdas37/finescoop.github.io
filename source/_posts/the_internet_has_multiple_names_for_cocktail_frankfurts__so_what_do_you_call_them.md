An Australian woman has ignited a fierce debate on social media after posting an image of cocktail frankfurts with tomato sauce and asking people what they typically call them.

The image, which was shared on Facebook on August 29, became a topic of discussion after people realised there were a range of very unique terms used to describe the popular party snacks.

'A conversation about the name of these is going crazy in another group I'm in. So what do you call them? I say cheerios and my partner calls them mini franks,' she said.

 What do you call these?

The seemingly innocent search for answers turned into a 3,000 comment strong investigation.

'I call them little boys but if you over boil them they become little girls,' one woman said.

'I call these mini saveloys, which is another name for a hot dog,' said another.

A third added: 'I call them little red boys actually'.

One lady said that as a child living in the 1970s and 80s in New South Wales her mother called them cocktail franks as opposed to the larger frankfurts. 

But when she brought up her own children in Queensland come the late 1990s and early 2000s she noticed they were called cheerios.

'I wasn't sure if it was a state or generational thing,' she said.

Others said they'd heard the term 'footy franks' on popular Aussie sitcom Kath and Kim and continued to use it in their day-to-day life.

There were terms like 'red hot lovers', 'red sausages', 'cocktail weenies' and 'little weenies' in the comments section, which were the more unusual suggestions.

Cocktail frankfurts are made out of finely textured meat including pork, seasoned with white pepper, garlic, cumin and chilli. 

They are then filled into an edible collagen casing and cooked.

They are usually served at barbecues or as part of larger platter plates alongside cheese and different types of ham and lots of tomato sauce or ketchup.
