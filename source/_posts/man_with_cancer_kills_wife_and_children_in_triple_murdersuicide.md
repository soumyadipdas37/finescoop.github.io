An Indiana father battling pancreatic cancer allegedly shot and killed his wife and two adult children then turned the gun on himself in a horrific triple-murder suicide.

The tragic shooting took place on Sunday when Jeff Mumper, 61, opened fire in his family’s Bloomington home.

Bloomington Police say Mumper shot his wife Annamarie Greta, 54, his daughter Emma, 26, and his son Jakob, 18, then took his own life.

Authorities responded around 10.20am to the home in the 2600 block of S. Olcott Blvd to conduct a welfare check on the occupants following a complaint by a woman who said she went to pick up her friend at the home but no one answered the door when she knocked.

She used a key to enter and found her friend, who appeared to be dead in a room, and called 911.

Officers found four people dead from apparent gunshots wounds, Bloomington police says.

They said evidence at the scene 'indicated that a 61-year-old man had shot and killed his 54-year-old wife' and their kids before shooting himself.

An investigation is ongoing and a motive is not known at this time.

Autopsies are scheduled for Wednesday in Terre Haute, according to WISHTV.

Friends say Jeffrey Mumper had beaten prostate cancer and was battling pancreatic cancer, according to WTHR. 

Emma was a graduate student at Stony Brook University in New York.

Jakob was an elite swimmer and senior at Bloomington North High School who was set to break several school records this season.

Police discovered the bodies on Sunday at the Mumper's family home in Bloomington, Indiana

'Those were my records from when I went through. So, to have coached someone who's now better than me, that's kind of what you really want as a coach. So, it's a tough loss on so many levels, the athletics being one of the lesser levels for sure,' Bloomington High School North boys swimming coach Max Irwin said.

Friends also say Annemarie Greta wanted to become a teacher and drove a school bus with the hopes of one day achieving her dream.
