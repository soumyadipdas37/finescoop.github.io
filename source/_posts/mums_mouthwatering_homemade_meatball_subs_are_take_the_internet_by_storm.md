Mum Nicole, from New South Wales, said the meal is her children's favourite. Once the meatballs were cooked, she stuffed the subs with cucumber, tomato, lettuce, capsicum and cheese

Once the meatballs were almost cooked completely, she added the sauce on top.

'I browned the meatballs so they were slightly undercooked, added [the marinade], put the lid on the pan and let it simmer for a short time,' she said.

'Then I removed the lid and let it simmer further to thicken the sauce.'

She said the meal is 'super easy and cheap' to make, and pleases the whole family.
