An ambulance, fire engine and helicopter are at the scene and the number of passengers aboard is not yet known.

Gavin Saxby posted a photo showing the vessel's bow badly damaged on social media.

He wrote: 'Just on PS Waverley as they crashed it into the pier at Brodick, what a mess on board, lots of injuries, hope everyone recovers.'

Karren Mulligan said: 'Wee trip on the Waverley today which was wonderful as I've waited 2 years to do it. Then it crashed.

'Thankfully I've managed to get away with a few bumps and bruises but so many people got much worse.'

Rita McLeod, who was waiting to board the Waverley, told the BBC she saw people being taken away in ambulances.

She said: 'We were actually queued up waiting to get in when it crashed. It came in bow first. It came in far too fast.

'We saw a lot of people falling, a few people fell over. There were people taken away in ambulances. We saw a lot of people, pretty badly shaken, coming off.'

Alistair Wylie from Gourock, told InverclydeNow: 'I heard the thud of the boat hitting the concrete pier. 

'A Coastguard helicopter is landing now and the Coastguard, ambulance, police and fire brigade are all here.'

Police Scotland said: 'Police Scotland is currently in attendance at Brodick Ferry Terminal after an incident involving a steam boat, which happened at 5.15pm.' 

The Waverley returned to the sea on August 22 for the first time in almost two years following major repairs.

An appeal for funding was launched last year after it was announced the paddle steamer would not sail in 2019.

More than £2.3m was raised in seven months by more than 8000 members of the public and £1m from the Scottish Government.

Waverley's 2020 sailing season was severely reduced due to Covid-19 from over five months to just a few weeks.

Passenger capacity was reduced to under 30 per cent resulting in an immediate funding crisis to meet the cost of the coming winter period.

The paddle steamer was built by A & J Inglis of Glasgow and first launched in October 1946.

In June 2009, it struck the breakwater at Dunoon with 700 passengers on board, 12 of whom suffered minor injuries.
