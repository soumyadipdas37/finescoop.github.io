She sported a blue bikini and tenderly touched her growing baby bump in the throwback snap.

It appears Felicity is following in her mother's footsteps as the images showed she has a love for handbags and all things pink.

All three of the couple's children are autistic after being diagnosed at the age of three with the developmental disability that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others.

Earlier this year, Christine admitted that she blamed herself for her children's autism before she learned more about the condition. 

Speaking on MTV podcast Nappy Days podcast, she said: 'It's hard enough being a mum but when you have children with additional needs its daunting.'

Revelation: Her three children were all diagnosed at the age of three with the developmental disability that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others

Challenge: Earlier this year, Christine admitted that she blamed herself for her children's autism and said it's 'daunting' trying to look after their additional needs

Christine admitted that, despite showing the early signs of the condition, she didn't realise what her twins were going through.

She added: 'They didn't speak. They were non-verbal, they'd walk on their tiptoes, they were sensitive to sound and light. 

'So if there was a sudden noise, they would jump out their skin. But I thought they were just softies.

 'I would think maybe it's because they are twins, two of them, or that I would not be giving them enough attention. So I blamed myself.' 

She said: 'It's hard enough being a mum but when you have children with additional needs its daunting'

She revealed: 'They didn't speak. They were non-verbal, they'd walk on their tiptoes, they were sensitive to sound and light. So if there was a sudden noise, they would jump out their skin'

Unknown: The Real Housewives of Cheshire star admitted that in the past she thought her children were just 'big softies' and wasn't fully aware of what they were going through

Due to Paddy's work commitments, Christine is frequently in charge of looking after their three children. 

The reality star admitted that she initially thought their lack of interaction with the outside world could be part of the reason for their delayed social skills.

She said: 'They were with me permanently. My husband works away a lot so I thought maybe it was me and that I hadn't taught them very well. 

'They also never went to nursery or playgroups so I blamed myself for them having no social skills.

'I thought that it was down to me doing a rubbish job as a mother.' 

Stay-at-home mum: Christine never enrolled Felicity, Penelope, or Leo in nursery or playgroups and she once believed that it played a part in their delayed social skills

Miracle: Christine also spoke about her surprise and joy at getting pregnant, having suffered from anorexia as a teen and being told by the doctor that she would struggle to conceive

Christine also spoke about her surprise and joy at getting pregnant, having suffered from anorexia as a teen.

She said: 'My mum took me to the doctor when I was about 15 because I wasn't having periods, and he said you've obviously got an eating disorder and this could affect your fertility and you could struggle to conceive.

 'I met my husband at 19 and I knew then I wanted to have a family, be a young mum. 

'My husband made me feel comfortable, made me have a healthier lifestyle, made me happier.

Excited! The reality star revealed that she met Paddy when she was 19 and always had hopes of becoming a young mum but couldn't quite believe it when she discovered she was pregnant

'I did 20 pregnancy tests because I didn't believe it!' she recounted. 

'I had to get over the eating disorder to get pregnant, I don't think i would have conceived while I was still so underweight because I wasn't ovulating, so I had to sort that out.'

Christine credits being pregnant for helping her recover from her eating disorder.

She added: 'Once I was pregnant all of those fears and worries thinking about weight just left me.

'Mother Nature and my own nature kicked in. I knew I had to eat to keep these children healthy and give them the best start.'
