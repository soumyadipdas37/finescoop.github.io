It's been eight years since they first worked together bringing The Hunger Games to the big screen.

And Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence still keep in touch.

Hutcherson, 27, revealed in an interview with ET that he enjoyed a 'socially-distanced dinner' with Lawrence, 30, over the summer.

He added that it had been 'good to catch up with her because she's been off living her life in other places all over the world.' 

He also revealed he caught up with co-star Liam Hemsworth at the end of 2019.

'We catch up every time we can.... No matter how much time passes, once we see each other again, it's instantly right back to where it was,' he shared.

The Hunger Games, based on the books by Suzanne Collins, premiered in March 2012 and spawned three sequels. 

Back in April, Hutcherson said in an interview with Newsweek that he is finally coming to terms with the global fame that enveloped him as a result of the films.

'I don't think there's really any way you can prepare yourself for that. It changed everything. It changed my entire public life for a long time. And then notoriety and recognition, all those things. It's crazy,' he told Newsweek.

'But I think now, just having been out of it for a long enough amount of time, I have a better perspective on it and feel fortunate and lucky that I was able to be a part of something like that.'

Hutcherson has been laying low during the COVID-19 pandemic, spending time with Spanish girlfriend Claudia Traisac, 27.

He and Traisac, an actress, met on the set of the 2014 film Escobar: Paradise Lost.

He acknowledged that quarantine could prove to be 'make or break' for couples but in his own experience, it had been really good for his relationship. 

'It's a lot of time to spend with someone, but we found a really good balance supporting one another and giving space when it's needed and being close when it's needed,' Hutcherson explained. 

'It's all about communication and I think in this time we've figured out a lot of things with that, so it's been great.'  

Hutcherson, who wrapped production on the James Franco directed drama The Long Way Home and the dramatic comedy Rita with Lena Headey before lockdown began, says he's aware of how lucky he is as the pandemic continues.  

'There are days where it's hard not to become depressed and down, but then you realize the fortunate position you're in, to be healthy and to have food on the table,' he told ET.

'There's a lot of people going through really hard times right now, so it's important to keep perspective on that,'
