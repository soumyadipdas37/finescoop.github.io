After entering the ninth week of this summer's transfer window, clubs from across Europe are still getting deals done as they look to bolster their squads ahead of the new campaign. 

Clubs have until October 5 to wrap up their business but complications caused by the ongoing pandemic mean they'll be keen to get their signings in sooner in time for pre-season training. 

Lionel Messi's transfer saga may have ended for now but there's still plenty of loose ends that need tying up before next month's deadline.
