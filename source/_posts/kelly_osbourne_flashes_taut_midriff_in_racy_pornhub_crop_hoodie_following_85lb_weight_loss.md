Kelly Osbourne showed off her taut midriff in a PornHub crop hoodie when she was glimpsed out in Los Angeles this week.

The 35-year-old former Fashion Police hostess could be spotted enjoying a stroll with her pal Daniel Nguyen who was in a Hawaiian shirt.

Kelly made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.

She complemented the dark hoodie with a pair of high-waisted black trousers and black shoes, popping on a pair of specs.

The style commentator wore her hair in pale purple and blue shades and slicked it tightly back into a bun for her latest outing.

Kelly, who was born in London, added a touch of dazzle to her California casual ensemble by putting on a pair of gleaming hoop earrings. 

The showbiz legacy recently revealed that she secretly had a gastric sleeve inserted a year ago and has since managed to drop 85lbs.

Kelly made the revelation on this week's episode of the podcast Hollywood Raw With Dax Holt And Adam Glyn, sharing: 'I had surgery.'

With her trademark defiance she dished: 'I don't give a f**** what anyone has to say. I did it, I'm proud of it, they can suck s****. I did the gastric sleeve.'

She explained: 'All it does is change the shape of your stomach. I got that almost 2 years ago. I will never ever ever lie about it ever. It is the best thing I have ever done.'

Kelly has also suffered temporomandibular joint dysfunction, known as TMJ, and has had facial injections to achieve a 'skinnier'-looking jaw.

Her latest outing comes roughly a month after her father Ozzy Osbourne was spotted out in public for the first time in months amid his Parkinson's battle.

Ozzy was glimpsed in the car with his wife of nearly four decades Sharon with whom he shares his three children including Kelly. 

Although Ozzy had not been seen out in public in months he did appear with his family on Celebrity Watch Party with a finale that aired July 23.

The Black Sabbath frontman went public with his Parkinson's diagnosis this January after being diagnosed in February 2019.

However despite his recent health crises and reduced mobility he has repeatedly declared that he will never abandon show business. 

'You know the time when I will retire? When I can hear them nail a lid on my box. And then I’ll f***ing do an encore. I’m the Prince of Darkness,' he told the Daily Mirror.
