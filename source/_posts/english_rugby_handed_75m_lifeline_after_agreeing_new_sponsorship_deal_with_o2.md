Cash-strapped English rugby has been given a major boost after O2 agreed a new sponsorship deal with the RFU worth more than £7.5million a year.

The long-term partnership was due to expire next year, but the Mail on Sunday understands the telecoms giant has agreed an extension despite the gloomy economic forecasts.

Australian rugby was rocked by the withdrawal of headline sponsors Qantas on Wednesday but O2 have not followed suit.

RFU CEO Bill Sweeney approached the government for a bailout this week after it was announced that crowds may not return for six months.

Premiership clubs have warned they may sink without financial aid, with Sale Sharks owner proposing tax breaks as an additional measure.

'Rugby was already a propped-up business that didn't make much commercial sense – and COVID has made it worse,' Orange told the Mail on Sunday. 'No crowds for six months is a killer blow. Crowds matter to the community game as much as they do to the Premiership.

'As a league, we probably contribute £50millon a year in taxes so it's in the government's long-term interests to not see clubs disappear. We're in survival mode and there's a real danger that could happen.

'The biggest part of a Premiership rugby clubs' cost base is salary. Each club probably has £400,000 a month in PAYE payments to make. If there could be some sort of write off or long-term deferral that would help, as part of a financial support package.'

However, Orange played down the prospect of a further cash injection from financiers CVC in return for more equity.

'Selling off shares at the bottom of the market isn't a good long-term strategy, although nothing is off the table,' said Orange. 'I imagine this has not been a good investment for them, so I can't imagine they're going to want to increase their investment.'
