Peter Andre's wife Emily MacDonagh has spoken out about the spike in coronavirus cases and suggested that young people may be to blame.  

The NHS medical professional, 31, said that young generations might feel that they don't need to wear a mask, a view she mentioned was also expressed by Noel Gallagher last week.  

Musician Noel, 53, was criticised when he admitted he's refusing to wear a face covering and branded them 'pointless'. 

Opinions: Peter Andre's wife Emily MacDonagh has spoken out about the spike in coronavirus cases and suggested that young people may be to blame

Writing in her OK! magazine column, Emily penned: 'I think people are in two camps when it comes to mask wearing – they either say it's up to me and I can work out my own risk, or they're really concerned about Covid and are taking all the precautions.

'I think it's predominately young people who feel the same as Noel, and probably as a result of this we are seeing more cases in young people.

'I understand people feel like the decision has been taken out of their hands, but we all need to do the same thing and pull together. It's all very well being young and healthy but we need to protect the more vulnerable people in our society.'

Going against the law: Noel Gallagher revealed last week he's refusing to sport a face mask, despite UK's restrictions to minimise the spread of coronavirus (pictured in February)

She added that people should 'accept the rules' because it 'won't be this way forever'. 

Last Tuesday Noel revealed he's refusing to wear a face mask, despite UK restrictions to minimise the spread of coronavirus - and has even gone to the extent of chartering a private jet to avoid wearing PPE.

Wearing a covering over your nose and mouth is mandatory by law in all shops, supermarkets and on public transport, with exemptions for people with medical conditions and children under 11.

Explaining the lengths he went to to dodge wearing a mask, Noel revealed that he and five pals travelled by private plane so they wouldn't be 'marched' around the airport being told what to do.  

He told The Sun: 'There was six of us and we were like, 'f going to Heathrow and being marched around and being told what to do'. So we went by private jet and it was very pleasant.

'It's not something I do often because they are expensive for what they are but the ballache of having to get on a plane in a mask. I was just like, 'F*** it'.'    

Meanwhile, during a new interview on The Matt Morgan podcast, Noel explained: 'Listen to me, it's not a law. There's too many f***** liberties being taken away from us now.'

The Oasis star recalled a time he requested to speak to a shop manager when an employee asked him to don a protective mask.

'I don't give a f**k. I choose not to wear one and if I get the virus it's on me, it's not on anyone else. If every other c***s wearing a mask I'm not gonna catch it off them, and If I've got it then they're not gonna catch it off me. I think it's a p***take', he said.

Last month, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that repeatedly refusing to wear a face mask could lead to a fine of up to £3,200.

At present those who do not cover their faces can be ordered to pay a penalty of £100 – or £50 if they pay within a fortnight.  

People caught without a mask for a second time face a fine of £200, with the amount doubling on every repeat offence to a maximum of £3,200. 

The rock star went on to reflect on another moment he went against the rules, explaining: 'I was going up to Manchester the other week and some guy's going 'can you put your mask on, because the transport police will get on and fine you a thousand pounds. But you don't have to put it on if you're eating.'

'So I was saying 'Oh right, this killer virus that's sweeping through the train is gonna come and attack me but see me having a sandwich and go leave him, he's having his lunch?''
