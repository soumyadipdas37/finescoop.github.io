Australian department store Big W has launched a huge 'Fresh Mirage' spring homewares collection featuring a range of stunning rattan furniture, outdoor living products, floral bedding and décor. 

The prices vary from $10 cushions to $499 for a stylish four-piece outdoor lounge set, giving competitors of the likes of Kmart and IKEA a run for their money.

The carefully crafted homewares pieces were inspired by desert colours and natural beauty to create a bohemian style at home. 

But customers should get in stores or buy online quickly as the new Spring collection will only be available from September 3 to 16.

When designing the range, Big W intended to create a selection of products that will 'enhance happiness and overall wellbeing' among individuals and families following a year of unprecedented challenges.

To do this, the store collaborated with internationally renowned leader of Positive Psychology Dr Tim Sharp, also known as Dr Happy.

'The last few months have been tough for families and caused massive disruption to most of our lives. We are spending more time than ever together in our homes, and it's fair to say some areas of our lives have been a little neglected,' Dr Sharp said.

To help families enjoy more positive emotions each day and ensure they feel good in their surroundings, Dr Sharp is challenging families to make a few simple, and affordable, changes that will leave them feeling revitalised.

'From the lighting of a room to ornaments and furniture, there are numerous ways the space we live in affects our happiness, which in turn leads toward better health and improved wellbeing, ultimately resulting in emotional benefits for the whole family,' he said.
