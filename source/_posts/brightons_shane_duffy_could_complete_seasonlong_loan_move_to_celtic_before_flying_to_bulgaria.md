Shane Duffy could complete his loan move to Celtic before flying to Bulgaria with Ireland's national team.

As Sportsmail first revealed the Brighton central defender is set to pen a season-long switch to Parkhead.

With Stephen Kenny's squad preparing to travel to Sofia for Thursday's Nations League clash, however, a tight schedule could prompt the 28-year-old to undergo medical checks at the Irish FA training camp before putting pen to paper remotely.

Speaking after Sunday's 3-0 win over Motherwell, manager Neil Lennon promised new signings during the international break.

And Duffy could be signed and sealed in time to focus fully on the international double header with the Bulgarians and Finland.

The rugged central defender also had interest from West Ham and West Bromwich Albion.

Warned by manager Graham Potter that his game time at Brighton could be limited by the emergence of academy product Ben White, however, Brighton's chief executive Paul Barber admits Duffy can go.

Brighton's chief executive Paul Barber praised Duffy but admitted that he could soon depart

'Shane has been absolutely magnificent for us,' said Barber, 'literally from the day he joined.

'He is a massive character on the pitch, he is an even bigger character off the pitch. He is loved by everyone at the club.

'It is a difficult decision for Graham (Potter) because there are so many centre-backs you can accommodate in one line-up, but Shane has been magnificent.

'We will be disappointed if we do lose him, but we also understand he wants to play football.'
