Andy Murray kicks off his US Open campaign on Tuesday evening against Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka in New York.

The former World No 1 will play his first singles match at a Grand Slam since the 2019 Australian Open, where his career appeared to be over due to a hip injury.

But the two-time Wimbledon champion underwent hip resurfacing surgery in January 2019 and has navigated a long journey back to the top.

Murray reached the last 16 at the Western and Southern Open last week and is now set to make his return to singles action at Flushing Meadows. Follow all the action with Sportsmail's Jonathan Spencer here. 

Host commentator

The long-awaited return of Murray at a Grand Slam is here. 

The players are practicing their serve before the first-round action gets underway! Looking forward to this one...

We've just had the toss, which Nishioka - who has previously played on Arthur Ashe against Federer - wins.

The 24-year-old Japanese player elects to serve first.

Both players are warming up now. The roof remains closed for now but the rain has just stopped...

MIKE DICKSON: It was three days before the 2019 Australian Open when the sluice gates finally opened for Andy Murray.

After uttering just two words - 'not great' - in response to an innocuous question about how he was feeling, he left the Melbourne Park interview room in tears to compose himself.

Never a quitter, he was back within a couple of minutes. It all came out as he emotionally expanded on how he had breached his sky-scraping threshold of pain, and could no longer go through the agonies required to compete at the highest level. Retirement beckoned.

Hello everybody and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of Andy Murray's first round match against Yoshihito Nishioka.

It will be an emotional time for Murray, who hasn't played a Grand Slam singles match in 20 months.

You can follow the live coverage right here. The players have just made their way to the court...
