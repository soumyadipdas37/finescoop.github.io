Great British Bake Off viewers were left in shock tonight when a contestant accidentally knocked her rival's cake off the judging table during the first episode. 

The first mini-challenge of the long-awaited show tasked the 12 bakers with making six tiny pineapple upside-down cakes, but Dave, 30, from Hampshire, was left in a difficult situation when his treats were knocked onto the floor. 

Pharmacy worker Sura, 31, had collided with the security guard while swatting a fly away from her completed cakes at the judging table, knocking into dave and sending his baked goods flying onto the ground.

An upset Sura quickly apologised, insisting: 'I'm so sorry. Oh my god. I'm so sorry there was a fly, I went to shoo it away and I knocked it'. 

Sura then burst into tears and hosts Noel Fielding and Matt Lucas rushed over to help, with Noel teasing: 'I blame Matt.'

Comforting Sura, the Little Britain comedian added: 'It's probably my fault, because I was looking at you and I think you were probably hypnotised by my beauty.' 

However viewers were slightly less forgiving of the incident, with several calling the incident 'sabotage', and saying they had 'gasped out loud' when the cakes had toppled.

'I actually screamed when she dropped his cakes', wrote one impassioned viewer.  Another said: Omg this is more intense than Baked Alaska Gate'. 

A third said: 'Oh. My. Goodness. Sabotage! Another agreed, 'Sabotage on the first bake off. I can't believe it'.   

But despite the drama, it was a guilty looking Sura who took away the first prize on the technical challenge, narrowly beating Peter who came in second place.

And luckily for Dave, his cakes survived to live another day, and were judged on their taste over their misshapen appearance.  

Many viewers compared the moment to the infamous Baked Alaska scandal that shook the nation in 2014.  

Construction engineer Iain Watters was appalled when Women's Institute member Diana Beard removed his Baked Alaska show-stopper from the freezer on a 30 degree day - and left it out to melt.

A devastated Sura wiped tears away from her eyes as she insisted the incident was accidental 

Dave was left worried about his cakes, but told Sura that 'accidents happen' and not to worry 

Iain, much like his dessert, went into meltdown, threw his soggy creation into the bin and stormed out of the tent.

The viewing public let out a collective gasp when Iain later returned and presented Mary and Paul with nothing. Mel was seen rubbing her temples in panic while Paul looked dumbfounded.

Unsurprisingly, Iain was given the boot, causing viewers to scream 'fix' at the baking show and the hashtag 'Justice for Iain' began trending on Twitter.

The BBC was even forced to issue a statement on the debacle after receiving 556 complaints from furious fans.  

Equally shocked fans took to twitter this evening, with one viewer writing: ''Omg this is more intense than Baked Alaska Gate'

Another, very impassioned viewer said: 'SHE'S KNOCKED THE CAKES OUT OF HIS HANDS. IT'S THESE TWO ALL OVER AGAIN'.  

A third commented: 'Is pineapple upside down cake the new baked Alaska?!'
