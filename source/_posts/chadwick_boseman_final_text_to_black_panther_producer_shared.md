Black Panther executive producer Nate Moore has revealed the touching final text he received from the late Chadwick Boseman.

The Marvel star sadly passed away from colon cancer aged 43 on Friday after fighting a secret battle, all while continuing to work and devoting his time to visiting sick kids in hospital.

And it was their work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation that Boseman referred to when he texted Moore, 'It broke me, man.'

In an interview with People, Nate described how he and the 42 actor 'worked together to get a young boy a voice note from T’Challa, as well as a package of toys.'

The filmmaker said Boseman cared 'so intently, and in hindsight, so personally' about the terminally ill children with whom they worked.

And despite how seeing the ill children 'broke' the A-lister, he texted Moore that 'we need to do that for them.'

'People deserve abundant life, special moments,' Chadwick's text continued. 'They’ve been through hell battling disease.'

'If we were able to ease their suffering and bring joy for a moment, and hopefully moments [as] he goes through the bags, then we made a difference in his life,' concluded the 21 Bridges star. 

Meanwhile, according to a new report by THR, apart from family Boseman only told 'a small group of insiders' about his cancer battle.

'No one involved with Black Panther was aware,' a source told the outlet. 

The superhero film grossed $1.35 billion worldwide and was nominated for a best picture Oscar.

When Chadwick passed away at his home in LA last week, his family said in a heartbreaking statement: 'It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman.

'Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV.

'A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much.'

The family revealed several of Boseman's recent films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, and August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, were filmed 'during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy.

'It was the honor of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther. The family thanks you for your love and prayers, and asks that you continue to respect their privacy during this difficult time.'

The thespian, who kept his diagnosis and personal life under wraps, is survived by his wife Taylor Simone Ledward and a parent, and had no children.
