Dr Alex George has admitted he's had a 'terrible year' following the tragic death of his younger brother Llŷr aged 19 in July.

During an interview with Sky News' Kay Burley on Thursday, the healthcare professional, 30, said he's been trying to 'move on with some element of purpose' as he detailed his plans to introduce mental health awareness to the school curriculum.

The former Love Island star said: 'It's been really tough, it's been a terrible year to be fair. Covid has put so much pressure on everyone and I've felt the impact of that.'

Llŷr died just weeks before he was due to follow in his older brother's footsteps and start medical school. 

'Losing him has been awful, he was supposed to be going to medical school so it's been the most terrible loss', the grieving star added.

The media personality discussed how he's been coping following his sibling's passing, confessing: 'I'm up and down, it's difficult. There's good days and bad days, but I feel like I have a real purpose and focus on that. I'll be alright, I've got to be.'

Alex went on to detail his initiative to encourage the UK education system to teach mental health to young students as he insisted 'we're losing far too many people to suicide.'

'I need to move on with purpose': During an interview with Sky News' Kay Burley on Thursday, the healthcare professional, 30, said he's introducing mental health awareness to schools 

The TV star shared: 'I think it's important to move on with some element of purpose. I want to change curriculums at school to have more support around mental health and make sure children are taught at a young age and leave with a mental health tool kit for themselves.'

When asked why he believes suicide rates among men are so high, the Exeter University alum, who worked on the NHS frontline amid the pandemic, said: 'There's a lot of factors. 

'Society places a sort of pressure: ''Man up, be tough, you'll be fine''. There's an expectation of men not to share their emotions. I know it's said, but men are far more likely to take their own lives than women.

Determined: Alex went on to detail his initiative to encourage the UK education system to teach mental health to young students as he insisted 'we're losing too many people to suicide'

'The way we can change that is through education. That is just as important as maths and science. If you're not happy and functioning well, what's the point learning the other stuff?'

Alex later shared tips on people can help others who are battling mental health issues, explain: 'I really think it's about your gut feeling. If you don't feel that someone isn't right, that's a big indicator on acting on it. 

'Often people withdraw themselves from others. I try to advise people to use the ask twice idea. That second invitation is a meaningful invite to say: ''I'm having a really bad day''. 

The suicide rate for men in England and Wales in 2019 was the highest for two decades.

Official data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found 5,691 suicides were registered last year, with an age-standardised rate of 11 deaths per 100,000 population.

The ONS said men accounted for around three-quarters of suicide deaths registered – 4,303 compared with 1,388 women.
