Jordyn's reveal of her new man came came more than a year after she was kicked out of the Kardashian–Jenner circle after Khloé Kardashian's then-partner Tristan Thompson kissed her at a party.

She was formerly one of star Kylie Jenner's best friends, and the two often seemed inseparable, but the friendship was severed after the brief tryst came to light.  

Last year, she appeared on Jada Pinkett Smith's Red Table Talk show on Facebook to admit kissing Tristan, though she claimed that it wasn't 'intimate.'  

She broke down during the interview, saying she was 'no homewrecker' and denying that she was the reason for Khloé and Tristan's split.
