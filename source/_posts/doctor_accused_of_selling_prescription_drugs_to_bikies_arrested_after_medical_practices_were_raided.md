A Brisbane doctor allegedly supplied prescription drugs directly to bikie gang members so they could sell them at a profit.

Police arrested the doctor during raids across Brisbane, including two medical practices in Fortitude Valley and Chermside, on Tuesday.

Detectives also seized steroids, prescription drugs and a large sum of cash during the operation.

The doctor has been charged with trafficking and supplying restricted medications and is due to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday.

Detective Inspector Larissa Miller says unregulated prescription drugs cause significant harm to people who abuse them.

'These drugs were supplied to gang members by a medical practitioner who knew they were going to be onsold within the community for profit,' she said in a statement.

'The Organised Crime Gangs group continues to target OMCG members and those who facilitate their offending, including people who hold professional positions of trust within our community.'
