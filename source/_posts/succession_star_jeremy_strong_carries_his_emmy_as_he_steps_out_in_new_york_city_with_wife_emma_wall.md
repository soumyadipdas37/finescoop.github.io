Fresh off his Emmy win the previous night, Jeremy Strong emerged from his hotel on Monday clutching his award.

The 41-year-old star was clad in casual clothes as he exited The Bowery Hotel in New York City with his wife Emma Wall by his side.

Emma could barely be seen behind a massive flower arrangement as the couple headed, with masks on, to a waiting car.

Jeremy paid tribute to Succession co-star Brian Cox on Sunday evening after beating him to the award for Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 2020 Emmys.

The American actor, 41, ensured Cox, 74, was honored in a heartfelt tribute after winning his first Emmy during the virtual event.

Strong - who plays Kendall Roy in the hit show - insisted his co-star was as deserving of the accolade, while admitting it was show creator Jesse Armstrong's writing that helped get him nominated in the first place.

He said: 'I read a poem by Stephen Dunn that said, "All I ever wanted was a book so good I’ll be finishing it for the rest of my life.'

'This job was that, for me. Jesse Armstrong, I owe this to you, Brian Cox, I share this with you. Thank you so much.'

Other nominees for the award included Jason Bateman, Sterling K. Brown, Steve Carell and Billy Porter.

The win capped a successful night for Succession, with Armstrong also winning the award for Writing for a Drama Series and Cherry Jones triumphing in the category for Guest Actress in a Drama.

After his win, Jeremy spoke at the virtual press room about the next season of the HBO show. 

'We’re hoping sometime this fall-winter as soon as things are safe,' he said about production getting started. 'I know there's plans in the works. I'm certainly ready to get back to it.'
