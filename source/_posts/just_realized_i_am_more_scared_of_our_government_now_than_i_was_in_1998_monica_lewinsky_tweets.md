Monica Lewinsky has tweeted that she is 'more scared of our government now' than she was in 1998 - the year her affair with Bill Clinton came to light, and his impeachment proceedings begun.

Lewinsky found herself attacked from all sides, and, aged 22, was at the center of a worldwide scandal.  

Her timeline on Monday showed the 47-year-old growing increasingly concerned in the days following Friday's announcement of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. 

A battle has now begun over the replacement of Ginsburg, a trailblazing Supreme Court justice who was decisive in enacting womens' and minority rights.

Democrats want any decision over her replacement to be made after November's election, while Donald Trump seeks to replace her with a conservative judge, immediately.

On Monday morning she tweeted: 'just realized i am more scared of our government now than i was in 1998. and that's saying a lot. A. LOT.'

Her tweet was 'liked' 187,000 times.

Lewinsky's previous tweets explained her agitation.

On Sunday she tweeted: 'i would love to know what the other justices — some of whom knew justice ginsburg for decades— think should be done with her dying wish? and what would they want if the president in office were of a different political party?' 

On Saturday she asked: 'ok, smart legal twitter... can #MerrickGarland sue for 'hiring discrimination' if/when they try to fill the seat?'

Garland was Barack Obama's choice to fill an empty Supreme Court seat, after Antonin Scalia died in February 2016.

Mitch McConnell, the Republican serving as leader of the Senate, blocked Garland's appointment, and declared any appointment by the sitting president to be null and void. He said the next Supreme Court justice should be chosen by the next president — to be elected later that year.  

Ginsburg's dying wish, dictated to her granddaughter Clara Spera and first reported by NPR, underscored the battle she knew was coming.

'My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,' she said.
