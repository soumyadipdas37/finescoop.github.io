Ex-Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre wants Lionel Messi to 'reconsider' his decision to leave the club as Manchester City eye a sensational move for the star.

Messi sent shockwaves through football last week when he sent Barca a burofax - a court-recognised service provided by Spain's postal service - to inform the club that he no longer wanted to play for them and considered himself a free agent.

The Spanish giants and LaLiga both insist that Messi's £630million release clause remains intact despite Messi's claims, but Mestre hopes the two parties can sort out their differences and avoid a parting of ways this summer.

Former Barca vice-president Jordi Mestre wants to see Messi and the club sort out their issues

'What I can say is that I hope they reconsider, sit down and find solutions,' he told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser. 

'When lawyers and burofax come into it, it becomes too complicated. The exit would have to be very dignified and one Leo deserves. The best player in history does not leave with a burofax.'

City were hopeful of landing Messi for nothing but that now appears unlikely, despite the Argentine refusing to return for the club for pre-season training.

Mestre, who resigned from his role as vice-president last year, has backed up Barca and LaLiga's stance when it comes to the clause in Messi's contract which would have allowed him to leave for free, insisting that it expired back in June despite the season being delayed.

'I am very surprised that there is a clause of this type,' he added. 'It sounds strange to me. The contract was from 2016 to 2021, his last year and by not saying anything before June 10 it is extended,' he said.

'Contractually, the decision is Barca's. The club and La Liga say so. Messi had to say before June 10 if he did not want to exercise it.'

However, despite wanting Messi to remain at the Nou Camp, Mestre admitted that the club's greatest players should be allowed to decide when they depart.

He added: 'There are club legends such as Xavi, Iniesta or Puyol and for all that they have contributed they have the right to decide when they leave the club or the end of their contract is reached.'
