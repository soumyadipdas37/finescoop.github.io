Police searching for a diplomat who disappeared after going for a jog nearly four months ago announced today they had found a body two miles from his home.

Richard Morris, 52, was last seen on the morning of May 6 after leaving his £1m detached home in the village of Bentley, near Alton, Hants, to go running.

Hampshire Constabulary said today a body had been found in nearby Alice Holt Forest - where Mr Morris was known to go running.

Police, who are not treating the death as suspicious, had previously spent days combing the dense woodland for any sign of the married father of three.

Mr Morris had been due to take up the position of British High Commissioner to Fiji in July.

He was the ambassador to Nepal between 2015 and November 2019 and accompanied the Duke of Sussex on a tour of the country in 2016.

Mr Morris took up his post in Nepal six months after the devastating earthquake that decimated many parts of the country and claimed some 9,000 lives.

He had previously been head of the Pacific department in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and held senior diplomatic posts including in Australia and Mexico.

A missing person appeal was launched on Thursday, a spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary said: 'We've been making enquiries but are now turning to you for your help

'Formal identification has not yet taken place, but the 52-year-old's family have been notified. They are being supported by specialist officers.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner.'

Mr Morris married his wife Alison in 1992 and they have one daughter and two sons. In his spare time, Mr Morris enjoyed long-distance running, reading, travel, music and spending time with his family.

Alison was his girlfriend at school. The couple went off to different universities but resumed their relationship in their early 20s.

He was awarded an MBA from Aston University. 

He undertook contract work for Touche Ross Management Consultancy as part of his MBA.
