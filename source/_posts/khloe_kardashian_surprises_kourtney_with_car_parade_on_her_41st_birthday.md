Khloe Kardashian successfully surprised her sister Kourtney on her 41st birthday with an epic car parade in front of her front yard. 

Kourtney's birthday occurred on April 18, not long after large gatherings were banned and social distancing came into effect in response to the coronavirus pandemic.   

But Khloe, 36, was still determined to safely gather the family together and make the birthday an unforgettable one for her big sister.

Turning lemons into lemonade: Kourtney's birthday occurred not long after large gatherings were banned and social distancing came into effect in response to the coronavirus pandemic 

In a new KUWTK teaser, Khloe can be seen organizing the big event just minutes before leading a giant procession of cars through Kourtney's neighborhood.

'So it's Kourtney's birthday, and we are going to drive by Kourtney's house, blasting birthday music, honking horns, annoying all the neighbors, and everyone did such a great job decorating their cars,' Khloe explained in a confessional. 

Khloe secretly teamed up with Kourtney's daughter Penelope, eight, to make her vision happen.

Before driving by her house, Khloe called her niece to fill her in on the plan.

'Hey Penelope can your mom hear me?' Khloe says on the phone.

'No,' Penlope replies.

'Okay good because we have a surprise. I'm gonna need you to do something for me. I need your help with getting your mommy out the front door and I'm gonna have a surprise for her on the street. 

'But I can't tell her, you're just gonna have to say, "Mom, can you come outside? I need to show you something." But don't ruin the surprise! You can take all the credit!'

Next, Khloe led the giant procession of cars from atop her own vehicle.  

'Everybody line up and get ready for the car parade!' Khloe says through her blow horn. 

Here comes the birthday girl: Kourtney made her way outside of the house with her daughter following close behind

After the parade was over, Kourtney waved good bye to everyone.

'Bye love you guys!' she shouts.
