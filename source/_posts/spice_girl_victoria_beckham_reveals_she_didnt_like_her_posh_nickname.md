Victoria Beckham took to Instagram on Thursday to reveal she didn't used to like her Posh nickname given to her when she was in The Spice Girls. 

But she said that embracing the moniker gave her 'confidence' and 'a voice' when she felt shy. 

Victoria, 46, found fame in the mid 90s as part of the iconic girl band with whom she achieved global success. 

'It wouldn't have been my first choice': Spice Girl Victoria Beckham revealed she didn't like her Posh nickname but has admitted the the moniker gave her 'confidence when she felt shy'

And the mother-of-four has revealed she is embracing her nickname 20 years and it has inspired her latest make-up collection.   

She wrote on Instagram: 'I was given the name Posh in 1996 over lunch with Peter Loraine of Top of The Pops Magazine and the rest of the Spice Girls.

'I can't say it would have been my first choice, but ultimately grew into it on my own terms. 

She said: 'I was young and shy, and being Posh helped me find my style and confidence, and my voice' (pictured in 1997)

'I was young and shy, and being Posh helped me find my style and confidence, and my voice.' 

She continued: 'Now, years later I look back on that formative time with appreciation. Posh forever changed the course of my life, opening the doors for me to go after my dreams.

'This week I celebrate Posh with the launch of Posh lipstick. 





Paying lip service: She shared this long post while talking about her Posh inspired new beauty line

'It is deeply personal - lipstick has always given me confidence when I needed it and extra spice when I already had it. 

'Each shade is inspired by a specific memory, and whilst the moments may have been my own, the energy and emotion is shared by us all.

'This is an ode to our lifelong journeys of self discovery as women. Posh is back.'

She continued: 'Now, years later I look back on that formative time with appreciation. Posh forever changed the course of my life, opening the doors for me to go after my dreams' (pictured with the group in 1997 - centre)
