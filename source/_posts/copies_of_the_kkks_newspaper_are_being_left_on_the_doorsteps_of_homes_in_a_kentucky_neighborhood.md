Unsolicited copies of the Klu Klux Klan's quarterly newspaper have been left on the doorsteps of dozens of residents of a Kentucky neighborhood, provoking outrage.  

A member of the white supremacist hate group said the motivation behind leaving copies of its Crusader paper in the Pleasure Ridge Park area of Louisville, was to ‘educate our White Christian Brothers and Sisters’, the Courier Journal reported.

The KKK member, who was not named, also said the group wanted ‘to let them know in these troubling times of Chaos created by BLM, Antifa, NFAC, Etc. That there is an organization here for them.’

Austin Beam, 24, said he was left outraged when he went outside to take out the trash on Tuesday morning to find the KKK’s Crusader newspaper outside of his home. He also saw it had been left on the lawns of a number of his neighbors.

Beam said he took a few photos of the self-proclaimed ‘premier voice of the white resistance’ before throwing it away.

‘Nothing like that has been distributed in my neighborhood before, and I’ve been here two years,’ Beam told WAVE 3.

Beam said he believes the racist outfit are attempting to capitalize on the racial tensions in the area, amid weeks of unrest and more than 100 days of protests in Louisville spurred by the death of Breonna Taylor.

The 26-year-old EMT was shot several times by three officers from the Louisville Metro Police Department on March 13, when they actioned a no-knock search warrant on her home during a drugs probe for which she was not involved.

The fatal shooting took place in Springfield Drive, less than three miles away from Pleasure Ridge Park. 

Beam said he feels the KKK are ‘trying to warp people's' narratives following BLM protests [by] using fear and racism.’

The 24-year-old said he had attended a number of the protests and listened to people’s accounts of racism in Louisville. He said their stories need to be heard.

‘Articles like the ones that were written in that paper are trying to frame it as something else, trying to frame one incident out of 10 as being, “This is how everything is, you should be scared, you should be afraid,” and that’s not how it is,’ Beam said.

‘I hope the beliefs in that paper don't take hold in our neighborhood and stay out of Louisville,’ he continued.

Much of the paper was about fighting against ‘Globalists, Leftists, Black Lives Matter, Antifa, the NFAC, and other similar groups’.

A copy of the Crusader was also left outside the home of another Pleasure Ridge Park resident, Kristin Kidwell, who question the extremist views voiced within its pages. 

‘There was a sentence that said “Communism, nowadays Black Lives Matter and Antifa...” What? That has nothing to do with any of this,’ she said.

‘I really think it is just to generate a stir and reach out to people on the fence not really sure of what to believe,’ Kidwell added.

In a statement to WAVE, a spokesperson for the KKK said the group’s intentions were to ‘educate’.

‘We're not the bad people here. BLM and Antifa are. They are rioting and destroying our communities because they're not getting their way. In the meantime, you have law abiding Christian white Americans that feel unwelcome in their own country.

‘We want them to know that they're still welcome. This is OUR country. Due to recent violence and destruction by these terrorist groups, Antifa and BLM, we will be more active. Look forward to seeing a lot more of the Honorable Sacred Knights in Louisville and surrounding areas.’

The KKK is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. 

The group has attempted to put on a ‘kinder, gentler’ in recent years, attempting to portray itself as a modern ‘white civil rights’ organization, according to the center. ‘But beneath that veneer lurks the same bigoted rhetoric.’

The Louisville Metro Police Department has not yet issued comment on the newspapers.
