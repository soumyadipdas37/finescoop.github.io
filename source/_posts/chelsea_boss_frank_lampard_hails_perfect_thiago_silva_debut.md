Chelsea boss Frank Lampard was delighted with Thiago Silva’s impact both on and off the pitch after the Brazilian made his full debut in the 6-0 thrashing of Barnsley.

The 36-year-old defender had sat out the first two fixtures of the season due to a lack of match fitness following his move from PSG.

A month after playing in the Champions League final, Silva produced an assured display in Wednesday's Carabao Cup tie at Stamford Bridge.

Afterwards Lampard said: ‘It was a perfect 60 minutes for him tonight. He will show the qualities he has. Of course, he will get fitter and better. 

'He also gave us something for me on the night in the dressing room and on the pitch of a leader with authority in terms of his demands on others. 

‘He can’t speak the language but at the minute that’s not even a problem because his presence and the way he commands people around him is already showing that to me in training and in our game tonight.

‘I am very very pleased with Thiago. It is what I expected of a player of his level but it is very refreshing to have him here at the club.’ 

Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud all found the net to add to Kai Havertz's hat-trick, with the £89million Germany playmaker thriving in the number 10 role for his treble.

Brazil defender Silva and England left-back Ben Chilwell made pleasing debuts on a comfortable night for the Blues.
