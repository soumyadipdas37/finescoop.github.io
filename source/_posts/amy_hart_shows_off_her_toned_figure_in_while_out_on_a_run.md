Amy Hart brushed off comments from trolls as she headed out on a jog after critics branded her a 'disgrace' for sharing her health retreat transformation.

The Love Island star, 27, showcased her sensational frame and ample assets in a pink sports bra, which she teamed with a pair of matching cycling shorts.

Amy has been spending time in Portugal at a retreat, where she lost lost 2kg (4.4lbs) following a healthy living regime with Juice Master Jason Vale.

Former air hostess Amy displayed her toned physique in the pink two-piece, which she styled with a black belt bag and a pair of red running trainers.

The reality personality wore her blonde locks loose, held in place with a pair of sunglasses, while she showcased her radiant complexion by going make-up free.

Amy kept herself entertained on the run by listening to some music through a pair of AirPods.

On Wednesday, Amy hit back at social media trolls who sent her abusive messages after she shared a before and after weight loss snap at the retreat.

Taking to her Instagram Stories, Amy wrote: 'Some of the comments on my post about what a disgrace I am for sharing the day one and seven pics.

'I went on holiday to a health retreat and have had thousands of messages with questions and encouragement, asking to follow my journey.'

Amy insisted she was not suggesting people take 'weight loss shots' or resort to drastic measures to lose weight quickly. 

She said: 'It's not a dramatic weight loss, it's not like I've lost two stone in seven days or something ridiculous like that. I'm not telling people to go and take weight loss shots or live on three cuppa-soups a day.

'It's a one week reset. As you'll see in the caption the actual juicing aspect was very far down the list for me and the weight loss even further down.

'My skin is glowing, I'm less bloated, I toned up through lots of fun exercise classes with friends. I had the best time on what is a slightly out there holiday so wanted to share!'

The TV star added that the main difference between her before and after photos is 'no wine and takeaways' and pointed out most of her trolls would likely never approach a stranger on a street to comment on their appearance.  

She said: 'Also side notes, 1) I'm still way over what I was in Love Island so I dread to think how pathetic and thin you thought I was then. 

'2) The difference between b&a is more exercise, no wine and no takeaways, your body needs a break sometimes! 

Speaking out: Amy insisted she was not suggesting people take 'weight loss shots' or resort to drastic measures to lose weight quickly when she shared her post 

'Final thought, in what parallel universe would you go up to a stranger in the street and tell them they look pathetic and ill, before or too thin? 

'Luckily for me it's not (I don't get it very often - I enjoy wine and takeaways too much!) but it's actually very offensive to some people.'

It comes after Amy unveiled the results of her seven-day juice diet in a series of Instagram snaps shared on Tuesday. 

Admitting she didn't go on the trip in a bid to shed weight, the former flight attendant insisted she embarked on the lifestyle overhaul alone to 'overcome her social anxiety' as she went on a solo holiday for the first time.

The media personality, who already boasted a toned figure, showcased her slimmed-down frame in a barely-there black bikini.

Detailing her health journey, the reality star wrote: '‼️‼️‼️RESULTS‼️‼️‼️So as you can see from these pictures my body did change from the 7 day @juicemasterretreats plan! I lost 2kg and toned up from all the exercise. 

'However, that isn’t why I went. As well as 2kg I Went on holiday on my own for the first time.

'Had to overcome my social anxiety in order to make all my lovely juicy friends. did my first spinning classes and loved them... did @bellicon_uk rebounding everyday and loved it!

'All in all a successful week!' The media personality, who already boasted a toned figure, showcased her slimmed-down frame in a barely-there black bikini

'Hauled myself out of bed everyday for a hike between 5-11km sometimes in a 5kg vest... jumped in a river... has a reset ready to come home and start a new chapter!

'All in all a successful week!! Thanks so much to @jasonvale for an amazing concept. Can’t wait to come back!!' (sic) 

Her trip comes after Amy proved there were no hard feelings with ex Curtis Pritchard as they happily posed for a snap together late last month. 

The blonde beauty cosied up to Curtis, 24, in a sweet snap captioned: 'Nostalgia babes x', five months after his split from fellow Islander Maura Higgins, 29.

The dancer also posted a snap of the pair, captioned: 'Good to see you x @amyhartxo.'

In the wake of the reunion, the former British Airways employee re-followed her former flame on Instagram.

Later on the evening, Amy looked a little worse for wear as she put on an animated display and hung onto her friend while leaving the Proud Embankment venue after the boozy Cabaret All Stars Show in London.

Curtis, a professional ballroom dancer with a talent for tango, left Amy devastated after he started to chase after single Islander Jourdan Riane while Amy was away in Casa Amor.

Former air-stewardess Amy then told producers she wanted to leave the August series, after her 'half-boyfriend' split with her and began to chase after Islander Maura, who he went on to date, but split from in March.
