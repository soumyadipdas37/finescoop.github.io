He might be a former footballer who has carved out a successful modelling and presenting career. 

But it seems that Kris Smith is just like the rest of us when it comes to parenthood.  

On Tuesday, the 42-year-old shared a candid and rather relatable picture of himself in the bathroom as his two baby daughters barged in on him while he was trying to use the loo.  

Every parent can relate! On Tuesday, Kris Smith shared a candid picture of his two young daughters barging in on him while in the bathroom - and joked that he can never escape from 'daddy daycare'

'I have a larger audience than most Australian sport...' Kris captioned the Instagram photo. 

He added the hashtags including 'Daddy daycare.' 

In the image, his two daughters, Mila Elle, one, and nine-month-old Frankie can be seen walking in as he tried to have some private time.

One fan commented underneath: 'That's your next 12 years - zero privacy.'

Kris shares his daughters with girlfriend Sarah Boulazeris. 

He also shares son Ethan, 10, with ex Dannii Minogue, 48.

Last month, Now To Love reported that Kris and Dannii made the decision to not share images of their son to social media so he can 'have a normal life out of the spotlight'.

Also last month, Kris revealed whether or not he plans to marry personal trainer Sarah.  

The model and Myer ambassador was asked when he will wed his 29-year-old girlfriend in an Instagram question and answer session with fans.

The 41-year-old grabbed his collar as if the room was steaming up and joked that it was 'getting hot in here'.

Kris then went on to say that Sarah will have to be the one to get down on one knee.

He added: 'I get asked this a lot... When will I marry Sarah? When she gets off her ass and proposes! It's 2020 now, she needs to propose, put a ring on it'.
