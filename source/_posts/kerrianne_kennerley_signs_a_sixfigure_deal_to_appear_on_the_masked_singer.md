TV legend Kerri-Anne Kennerley may have been dumped from Studio 10, but she could possibly make a comeback on the network.

Despite rumours she's moving to Nine, the 67-year-old has reportedly signed a six-figure deal to appear on season three of Channel 10's The Masked Singer.

According to New Idea magazine, Kerri-Anne has met with executives to negotiate a role on the celebrity guessing game next year.

'It was a no-brainer and the deal was signed straight away. She's getting about $100,000,' claimed an insider. 

'She's left the lowest-rating show on the network to go to one of the highest-rating shows,' they added.

Kerri-Anne remains under contract with 10 until the end of the year, which means any future appearances on the network in 2021 will require her to sign a new deal. 

Rumour: According to New Idea, Kerri-Anne has met with executives to negotiate appearing on the third season of the popular television show 

Kerri-Anne was one of 25 employees to be made redundant from Channel 10 as a cost-cutting measure last month.

Rumours surfaced recently that she was plotting a return to Nine, after she was spotted playing golf in Sydney with one of the network's top executives. 

Kerri-Anne hosted Nine's Midday program from 1996 until 1998, before fronting What's Cooking the following year.

In 2018, she moved back to Channel 10, becoming a regular panellist on Studio 10. 

Regarding Kerri-Anne's exit from Channel 10, a spokesperson for the Logie winner said last month that she was 'disappointed' to be leaving. 

'Kerri-Anne's role on Studio 10 was only part-time two or three days a week,' her manager said in a statement.

'Nevertheless she is disappointed to be finishing up in September but understands the financial pressures on the network. She wishes everyone at Network 10 the best.'
