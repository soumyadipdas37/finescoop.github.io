A prankster stitched up a friend on a first date - by ordering a dessert to his table on a plate decorated with the words, 'Will you marry me?'.

Lee McIver, 24, from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, knew his friend Stephen Durand, 38, was meeting a woman at a steak restaurant for a romantic meal.

But he called the restaurant, Finsbay Flatiron, in Glasgow, pretending to be Stephen, who works as a roofer, and told staff he was planning to pop the question to his date.

Lee McIver, 24, from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, stitched up friend Stephen Durand, 38, who was on a first date, by ordering a dessert to his table on a plate which was decorated with the words, 'Will you marry me?'

Lee knew his Stephen was meeting the woman at Finsbay Flatiron steak restaurant, in Glasgow, for a romantic meal. He rang up the venue pretending to be Stephen and told staff he was planning to pop the question to his date. They then carried this dessert to the table 

Restaurant workers brought out prosecco and a cheesecake on a plate decorated with 'Will you marry me?' - as a friend of Lee's filmed it from another table.

The baffled woman told waiting staff, 'This isn't ours, 100 per cent it's not ours' as the cake was presented at the table.

The prank cost Lee £140 including giving his friend Michael Docherty, 21, £100 to eat at the restaurant so he could film it, while the remaining £40 covered dessert, alcohol and a tip.

Lee, who works as a scaffolder, said: 'We've been laughing about it, about an hour before his date I phoned the restaurant and pretended to be him and said I was going to propose.

The baffled woman told waiting staff 'this isn't ours, 100 per cent it's not hours' as the cake was presented at the table

'The manager said, "We'll bring out the cake and a bottle of prosecco and dim the lights".

'They brought out a candle and the plate and a bottle of prosecco.

'Stephen was just laughing, the girl was a bit embarrassed, she didn't think it was for their table at first.

'I got a friend to go in and and film it and paid for his dinner, Stephen doesn't even know hm.

'He was there with a picture of Stephen's face. It was £140 for the prank but it was worth it.'

Lee said the girl was not impressed, but his friend, who is also from Clydebank, had seen the funny side. 

Lee's video has since been widely shared on social media, with his original Twitter post receiving more than 50,000 likes and 3,700 retweets. 

One person wrote, 'Well done sir'. 

Another added, 'If that doesn't spook her she's a keeper.'
