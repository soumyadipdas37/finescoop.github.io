Every passenger on board a TUI flight from Zante to Cardiff has been told toÂ self-isolate after seven tested positive for coronavirus.
Passengers who were on TUI flight 6215 on Tuesday are now being considered as 'close contacts' of those who tested positive for COVID-19.
The seven cases were from three different parties on board the flight.
Dr Giri Shankar, Public Health Wales director, said: 'These passengers will be contacted shortly, but meanwhile, they must self-isolate at home as they may become infectious, even without developing symptoms. Anyone with symptoms should book a test without delay.
'Our investigations into a number of cases of coronavirus have indicated that a lack of social distancing, in particular by a minority of the 20-30 year age group, has resulted in the spread of the virus to other groups of people.'
