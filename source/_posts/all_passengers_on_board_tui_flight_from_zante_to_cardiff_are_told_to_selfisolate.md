Every passenger on board a TUI flight from Zante to Cardiff has been told to self-isolate after seven tested positive for coronavirus.
Passengers who were on TUI flight 6215 on Tuesday are being considered as 'close contacts' of those who tested positive for COVID-19.
The seven cases were from three different parties on board the flight.
Dr Giri Shankar, Public Health Wales director, said 'These passengers will be contacted shortly, but meanwhile, they must self-isolate at home as they may become infectious, even without developing symptoms. Anyone with symptoms should book a test without delay.

'Our investigations into a number of cases of coronavirus have indicated that a lack of social distancing, in particular by a minority of the 20-30 year age group, has resulted in the spread of the virus to other groups of people.'
Dr Giri Shankar, of Public Health Wales, said passengers were being contacted but must quarantine at home in the meantime, as they could become infectious even without symptoms. 
No new deaths related to Covid-19 were reported by the public health body in Wales on Sunday, while it said 56 cases had been confirmed.

Today is the third consecutive day that neither Wales or Northern Ireland recorded any Covid-19 fatalities. 
He urged revellers enjoying the bank holiday weekend to remember the importance of social distancing.
Dr Shankar added 'I would make a direct appeal to young people to remember that even if they feel that they would not be badly affected by Covid-19 if they were to test positive for it, if they were to pass it on to older or more vulnerable family members, friends or colleagues it could be extremely serious, even fatal.'
