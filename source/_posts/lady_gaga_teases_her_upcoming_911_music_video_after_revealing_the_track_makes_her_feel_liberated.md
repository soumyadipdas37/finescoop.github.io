Lady Gaga recently revealed shooting the music video for her single, 911, made her feel more 'alive' than at any other point of quarantine.

And on Thursday, the 11-time Grammy winner shared two shots of herself teasing the upcoming video for her fan-favorite track, one day ahead of its release. 

'911 short film out tomorrow at 9am PT,' the 37-year performer captioned one preview which showed donning a drapey white, pink and red gown with her mouth agape and a mask shielding her eyes.

First look: Lady Gaga shared two shots of herself from the set of the highly-anticipated music video of her sixth album's fan-favorite track, 911

The first look of her highly-anticipated video, which was shot in August, was quite the thrill for fans who last got a single from Gaga's Chromatica in May.

While most of her face was covered in the shot, two of the beloved songwriter's tattoos could be seen - including the Tony Bennett-inspired trumpet on the inside of her right bicep.

Another shot saw her laying down on a white sheet with her bright blue tresses cascading toward the camera and what appeared to be a bicycle cast aside in the background

The Oscar winner posts on social media come after her revealing new profile in Billboard, which shed light on some of her darkest hours.

'I used to wake up every day and remember I was Lady Gaga — and then I would get depressed,' the 5foot2 talent - real name Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta - revealed.

The emotions came from a mix of things, the Rain On Me singer explained, born from the messy place between denial and self-realization.

'I was peeling all the layers of the onion in therapy,' she told Billboard's Nolan Feeney, 'So as you dig deeper, you get closer to the core, and the core of the onion stinks.'

And Gaga wasn't ready to deal with the pain yet, and instead fought the depression with 'hours' of chain-smoking, sobbing and drinking.

'I used to wake up every day and remember I was Lady Gaga — and then I would get depressed,' the 5foot2 talent - real name Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta - revealed

'My existence in and of itself was a threat to me,' she explained. 'I thought about really dark sh** every single day.'

When the diva's inner circle suggested help like self-care or a getaway, Gaga would dismiss the ideas outright.

She made excuses about how she was trapped by fame, unable to do anything normal - pulling what she now calls her Lady Gaga card.

'It’s the one where you go, "I’m Lady Gaga, you don’t understand what it feels like, I want to dress how I want and be who I am without people noticing, why does everybody have to notice, I’m so sad, I don’t even know why anymore, why are you making me talk about it?"'

Adjusting: While making Chromatica helped pull her out of a fog, getting the dance-homage album to fans was another story, as the coronavirus swept through the globe and pushed  the release from April 10th to May 29th

That thought trap is something she's been able to subdue over time explaining, 'I gave that up in therapy.'

But it wasn't until the A Star Is Born ingenue got back into the studio that she started to feel more and more like herself.

While writing songs, Gaga said she 'would cry and go, "There it is — hi! How’s it going? Why do you got to hide?"

She latched onto those feelings, explaining how she learned to value even the smallest accomplishments.

'If there’s one glimmer inside you, celebrate it,' the New Yorker said, also showing her instinct to share that knowledge with the legions of fans she calls her Little Monsters.

'When you find another one, celebrate it,' Gaga went on. 'One more? Call a friend: "I did this today. I’m winning."'

Sweet surprise: In May, just days before Chromatica, she released the blockbuster music video for Rain On Me, her collaboration with Ariana Grande

While making Chromatica helped pull her out of a fog, getting the dance-homage album to fans was another story.

Her grand release plans were quickly shelved after life as we know it shuttered as the coronavirus swept through the globe, pushing the album's April 10th release day to May 29th.

But instead of sinking back into that dark place, Gaga pushed herself to inspire.

'When I see people struggling like they are right now, My brain goes, "Put on your superhero suit. Let’s go."'

For Gaga, that's meant working around the pandemic and continuing to share her art with the world.

On May 22nd, just days before Chromatica, she released the blockbuster music video for Rain On Me, her collaboration with Ariana Grande.

Light through the darkness: 'Freedom for me is when I can go to the darkest part of my heart,' Gaga said, wrapping the interview, 'Visit things that are hard and then leave them behind. Give them to the world, and spin all the pain into a puddle of gold'

The video has since earned 214million views on YouTube and along with the album is all but guaranteed to be a darling of the 2021 Grammy Awards, which are currently set for the end of January.

Gaga's kept the creative momentum going, revealing that the video for the song 911 - a dark electropop track about her relationship with her antipsychotic meds - was shot back in August.

Creating the video forced the singer to revisit some the demons haunting her while writing 911, something she found more liberating than painful. 

'Freedom for me is when I can go to the darkest part of my heart,' Gaga said, wrapping the interview, 'Visit things that are hard and then leave them behind. Give them to the world, and spin all the pain into a puddle of gold.'
