Just one week after filming started in Chicago, production on NBC's hit drama series Chicago Med is shutting down for two weeks due to a positive COVID-19 test.

While it was not revealed who had tested positive, Deadline reported that a regular rapid test, part of the show's new safety protocols, yielded a positive test result.

The person, said to be, 'a production team member from a Zone A department,' was sent home immediately.

Since the individual who tested positive was in 'close proximity' to other cast and crew members, Wolf Entertainment has shut down production for two weeks.

The positive test also 'triggered guidelines from both the NBCU Production Playbook and state and local guidelines as well.

This was reportedly the second positive coronavirus test coming within the first week of production, also within the same department.

The first positive COVID-19 test came from a different crew member on September 24, just two days after filming began in Chicago.

Production shut down midday after the positive test result was revealed, though filming resumed as scheduled the next day.

Still, despite the two-week shutdown, the COVID-19 hiatus will not impact the show being delivered on time this season.

Chicago Med was the first of NBC's trio of Chicago shows - along with Chicago Fire and Chicago P.D. - which are all slated to debut their new seasons on November 11.

The shutdown will also not impact the start of production on both Chicago Fire and Chicago P.D. starting on October 6, with all three shows filming in Chicago.

All three shows were created by Derek Haas and Michael Brandt and developed under Law & Order creator Dick Wolf's Wolf Entertainment banner.

NBC announced in February it had handed out three-season renewals for all three of the Chicago shows, which had reached a whopping 66 million viewers combined in the 2018-2019 television season.

Universal Television also inked a five-year pact with producer Dick Wolf and his Wolf Entertainment banner.

Wolf Entertainment also signed a separate deal with NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock, which will be the streaming home to all of the Chicago shows and Wolf's Law & Order franchise.
