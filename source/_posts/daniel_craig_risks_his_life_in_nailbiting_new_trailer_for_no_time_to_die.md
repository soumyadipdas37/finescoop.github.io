The new trailer for No Time To Die, Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond, was released on Thursday. 

The actor looked brooding as ever in the trailer which sees him confront villian Safin, portrayed by Rami Malek, who viewers are told is concocting a plan that could kill 'millions'. 

The nail-biting video opens with 007 narrowly avoiding being hit by a car before smashing into a wall.

The 25th film in the franchise finds Bond after he has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright, from the CIA turns up asking for help. 

Leaving his seemingly happy live with Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), Bond returns to the field to face Rami Malek's mysterious villain Safin who is armed with a new dangerous technology that could impact the world.

In the trailer, 007 is told of the danger Safin presents by Madeline, who tells him that he is after 'revenge' and her.  

During his journey, Bond also works alongside fellow 00 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch) as well as CIA spy Paloma (Ana De Armas), who he meets in Santiago.  



Unveiled: The new poster for the latest James Bond movie was unveiled on Tuesday evening, after the film's release was delayed by seven months

The new poster for the latest James Bond movie was unveiled on Tuesday evening, after the film's release was delayed by seven months.

Shared on the official James Bond Twitter and Instagram accounts, the poster shows franchise star Daniel  looking debonair in a classic black tuxedo.

Getting into character as the suave agent 007, the actor stares menacingly at the camera as he totes a small pistol, while the film's title is set in gold lettering.

 

Captioning the image, the promotional team wrote: 'Man on a mission. Check out the new poster for #NoTimeToDie, in cinemas this November.'

In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20.

The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, was originally scheduled for release in April, but was pushed back to November 25 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was then brought forward to November 8 before the most recent change.

In the summer, it was reported that the film's release date was set to change once again, after the COVID-19 crisis led the launch to be delayed by seven months.

According to a report from The Sun, it was being considered whether the film's release should be moved yet again over fears of losing money at the box office.

It was claimed that the continued increase in COVID-19 cases in the US meant film executives were concerned about how many people would be able to see it.  

A source told the publication: 'There are secret talks about what to do. Having No Time To Die earning less than half a billion would be deemed a disaster no matter the circumstances.'

MailOnline contacted EON productions for comment at the time.

The upcoming movie will mark Daniel's last-ever outing as the iconic character, which the actor recently insisted he was 'fine' about.

He told British GQ: 'I'm really... I'm OK. I don't think I would have been if I'd done the last film and that had been it. But this, I'm like... Let's go. Let's get on with it. I'm fine.'

The actor also insisted he isn't too worried about his post-Bond career, as he claimed: 'I'm pretty sure I can play just about anything. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I can, or at least I can make a f**king good fist of it.'

Exciting: Daniel was more involved in the writing of the new movie than he has been in the past, including having Phoebe Waller-Bridge brought on board to tweak the script

Daniel was more involved in the writing of the new movie than he has been in the past, including having Phoebe Waller-Bridge brought on board to tweak the script. 

Producers are also reportedly planning a spin-off based on the spy's recently-discovered daughter, penned by the Killing Eve' scribe Phoebe. 

Sources claimed bosses have approached her to pen a franchise documenting how the offspring of 007 becomes an agent herself. 

It comes following reports that Bond is set to to have daughter in the long-awaited James Bond film. 

No Time To Die will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20.
