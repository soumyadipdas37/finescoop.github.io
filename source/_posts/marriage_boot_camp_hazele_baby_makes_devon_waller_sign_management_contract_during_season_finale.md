Hazel-E Baby made her boyfriend sign a management contract in order to stay with her on Thursday's season 17 finale of Marriage Boot Camp: Hip Hop Edition.

'I know you said you were against pre-nups, but going forward, you sign my management contract,' she told De'Von Waller, 25. 'Since I'm going to help you, we make this fair, so therefore I don't feel like I'm getting completely played.'

The former Love & Hip Hop star, 40, had come on the show concerned that her younger boyfriend was with her for 'clout,' aiming to raise his social media profile.

She'd bought him clothes and gifts, and gotten him coverage on blogs and TV, she said—so the only way she'd feel safe was for her to get a percentage of any income he made from it.

De'Von denied that he was chasing fame, but when a lie detector test revealed that he had lied about wanting clout, Hazel-E lost it, fearing that her worries had come true.

At her behest, De'Von signed the contract to be with her, not even reading it first.

'Nothing says true love like a management contract!' observed the show's host, Dr. Ish Major. 'Really, is this what we're doing? Hazel, how much control do you want over this man?'

'I don't want her to think that I'm using her for clout,' insisted De'Von.

'You certainly aren't now,' Ish retorted, as the couple exchanged rings.

In June, Hazel-E gave birth to their first child, Ava Dior Waller.

As their 10-day stay in the Boot Camp house drew to a close, couples had to decide whether they would be together in the future by giving each other rings.

During the ring ceremony, reality star Tahiry Jose, 40, gave herself a promise ring instead of handing one to her boyfriend, the rapper Vado, 35.

Vado had attacked Tahiry during an earlier episode of the show, angered by something she'd said in a group meeting—and he'd been separated from her ever since.

The lie detector test had asked Vado if he was truly sorry for what he'd done, but Tahiry didn't even want to read the results.

'In this box, there's a ring,' she told him. 'And I'm keeping it. 'Cause this is self-love.'

At the beginning of the day, all of the couples had been given the results of lie detector tests they'd taken on the previous episode, in which they asked each other one burning question.

Test results: The lie detector test had asked Vado if he was truly sorry for what he'd done, but Tahiry didn't even want to read the results

The results were read out by judge Lynn Toler, 60, who assisted with the show.

For actor Medina Islam and lawyer/reality star Phaedra Parks, 46, the question was whether each of them wanted to have sex with each other, something they'd never done.

Medina had honestly answered yes, and Phaedra had said no, leading Medina to ask the cameras, 'Why are we here then? This is madness.'

Willie Taylor, 39, and his wife Shanda Taylor had dealt with cheating issues for years, and she wanted to know if he'd stay faithful, while he wondered if she could forgive him.

Both of them answered yes, and Willie's results said he'd told the truth, though he elected not to find out whether Shanda had.

'Y'all have my heart,' Lynn told them. 'You guys got so much at stake, but you are so mature and trying so hard. I think you've turned this thing around within the 10 days.'

Tense time: The couples anxiously awaited the results of the lie detector tests

Heart stolen: 'Y'all have my heart,' Lynn told Willie and Shanda Taylor. 'You guys got so much at stake, but you are so mature and trying so hard. I think you've turned this thing around within the 10 days'

Tahiry had been asked by the show's hosts whether she accepted physical violence as a normal part of a relationship after Vado nearly strangled her on the show.

While she answered no, the lie detector said she was lying, though Tahiry disagreed with it.

Finally, Hazel-E and De'Von were up, with the only question being whether De'Von had gone after Hazel for the fame.

'Deception was indicated,' Lynn told Hazel-E, who'd recently gone through a miscarriage and so was exempt from questioning herself.

As Hazel-E's face turned red, Lynn reminded her that she didn't need a man to be a 'strong, bad chick,' but if she did pick one, she should pick one that brought 'comfort and calm.'

Upset, Hazel-E fled outside, throwing water from her bottle and collapsing on a sofa in tears, as Shanda and Phaedra comforted her.

Fame seeker: Finally, Hazel-E and De'Von were up, with the only question being whether De'Von had gone after Hazel for the fame

'I just feel completely played, baffled, I feel hustled,' she said in a confessional. 'I feel used, like everybody gonna hit me with a big, 'I told you so.'

De'Von approached Hazel-E to tell her he loved her and the results meant nothing.

'You got on TV, you got social media clout, you made blogs, you got a bunch of new s***…' she observed. 'You already came the f*** up, so why the f*** are you still here?'

Feeling hustled: 'You got on TV, you got social media clout, you made blogs, you got a bunch of new s***…' Hazel-E observed. 'You already came the f*** up, so why the f*** are you still here?'

'Because I love you,' De'Von protested, to which Hazel-E responded, 'F***ing thirsty, cool the f*** off,' and tossed water from her bottle at him.

De'Von followed her upstairs as she cried, 'What do you want from me? You got what you came for, so go!'

Later, Hazel-E spoke to her mother, who advised her to put De'Von on a management contract, so that if he did 'come up' in the world, she would get a percentage.

True love: De'Von followed her upstairs as she cried, 'What do you want from me? You got what you came for, so go!'

She started to soften, saying to the camera that she'd been in relationships herself where she had 'not the best intentions going in, so I can kind of understand him a little bit.'

Still in the meeting room, Lynn sat down with Tahiry to try to understand how she really felt about bearing the brunt of physical violence by a man.

She wondered if Tahiry had seen so much of it in the community around her that she may have had an almost 'visceral' reaction to the question, setting off the lie detector.

'I guess it happens so often to women that the slightest inappropriate touch is not really seen as that big a deal,' Tahiry conceded.

At the ring ceremony that evening, Ish watched over the couples as they spoke to each other.

Willie and Shanda went first, with Shanda saying she wasn't sure she'd ever forgive his cheating, and Willie concerned that she had all lost respect for him.

He knelt down and said, 'Fifteen years of friendship, 12 years of marriage, three kids. And 10 days ago, we didn't know if we could even stand one second with each other.'

Opening the box, he added, 'Ten days later, I don't want to live another second without you.'

Shanda wept and opened her box, which like Willie's had a ring inside.

Hazel-E and De'Von went next, with De'Von telling her he didn't want her to change the way she looked at him just because of the results, noting, 'That's not who I am. That's not why I'm here.'

Getting emotional: Shanda wept and opened her box, which like Willie's had a ring inside

Privately, Hazel-E responded, 'You just failed this lie detector test, so what I'm not gonna do is make the same mistake again. Before you and me go forward, due to your circumstances, now you have to play in my arena, or get the f*** off the field.'

De'Von signed the contract, as Hazel-E said, 'You just do the last page and we'll figure out the rest.'

Phaedra and Medina were next, and the actor told her that he loved her spirit but didn't think she was 'ready for a man like me,' with which Phaedra agreed.

Contract offer: De'Von signed the contract, as Hazel-E said, 'You just do the last page and we'll figure out the rest'

She presented him with a ring, but Medina's box was empty, though he promised to hold onto her ring in case she ever became truly ready.

The last couple to go was Tahiry and Vado, and the rapper emphasized that being on the show had made him realize he needed to grow up.

From the moment Tahiry looked at him, it was clear she wasn't going back.

'I gotta do this for young Tahiry,' she reflected, thinking of the abusive relationships she'd been through. 'I gotta do this for me. I gotta do this for every woman in that house that feels like what you did was acceptable. I gotta do it for every little girl and every woman that a shove means nothing to because it's just something that happens in a relationship.'

Vado looked at Ish. 'Y'all serious, you bring me up here for this?' to which Ish replied, 'It's her truth.'

'I wanna make all the excuses in the world for you, and every time I blamed me,' Tahiry told Vado. 'When I look at the 10 days we spent here, I'm so mad that you were not able to be here, and I've learned a lot about me, too. Why was I not afraid? That's not normal. And I don't wanna live like that no more.'

No fear: 'I wanna make all the excuses in the world for you, and every time I blamed me,' Tahiry told Vado. 'When I look at the 10 days we spent here, I'm so mad that you were not able to be here, and I've learned a lot about me, too. Why was I not afraid? That's not normal. And I don't wanna live like that no more'

She kept the ring, and Vado complained that the whole thing was 'bulls***.'

Tahiry handed back the unopened answer to his lie detector test, no longer wanting the results.

'This is crazy,' Vado said to Ish. 'I messed up one time, I gotta go through all of this?'

'Yes,' Ish returned. 'Because that was a huge mess-up.'

Big mistake: Ish told Vado that he made a mistake and was suffering the consequences

He told Vado a van was waiting for him in the driveway, and handed him the envelope with the result of his test, which Vado threw on the floor.

'I got wild love for Ty-Ty,' the rapper offered later. 'The big lesson that I learned? I just want to do right by a woman, and by right, I mean never putting my hands on 'em.'

At the very end of the show, Willie finally opened Shanda's envelope.

'Can you truly forgive Willie for his infidelity?' he read aloud, marveling: 'She answered yes. And no deception was indicated.'

Wild love: 'I got wild love for Ty-Ty,' Vado offered later. 'The big lesson that I learned? I just want to do right by a woman, and by right, I mean never putting my hands on 'em'

No deception: 'Can you truly forgive Willie for his infidelity?' Willie read aloud, marveling: 'She answered yes. And no deception was indicated'
