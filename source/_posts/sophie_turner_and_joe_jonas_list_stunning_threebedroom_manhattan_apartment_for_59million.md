Sophie Turner and singer husband Joe Jonas have listed their three-bedroom Manhattan apartment for $5.9million. 

The Game of Thrones star, 24, and singer husband, 31, have been based on the West Coast since welcoming daughter Willa into the world in July.

They first quietly put the New York apartment on the market back in July for $6.5million but it have since relisted with a price reduction, according to property reports. The actress paid $5.6 million for the property back in 2018.

A private foyer leads way to a formal entryhall which opens into a 49 ft. long loft-like living space.

Custom stained white oak floors run throughout the gorgeous space, with custom oak doors and 10-inch base moldings.

The open-concept kitchen is illuminated with natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows on either side of the home.

Turner and Jonas confirmed the news of their new arrival in a July statement that said they were 'delighted to announce the birth of their baby.' 

'The couple is already obsessed and can't stop gloating about their new addition,' a source told Entertainment Tonight.

'With the pandemic, Joe and Sophie have been very cautious about who is around them and their little girl.'

Joe and Sophie were first married during a surprise Las Vegas wedding in May 2019 which was broadcast live on Diplo's social media, and shortly followed up with a family affair in France two months later.
