Frank Lampard is confident that the language barrier will not prove to be a serious problem for new Chelsea defender Thiago Silva.

The 36-year-old joined the Blues on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain last month and made his Premier League debut on Saturday, captaining the side against West Brom.

However, it did not go quite according to plan, the Brazilian at fault for Callum Robinson's second goal as the Baggies rushed to a 3-0 lead in the first half.



Silva was ultimately replaced in the 73rd minute with Lampard's team going on to rescue a point and fans were left questioning whether his poor English might prevent him from being able to lead the team.  

'I am not sure how relative it was today but he doesn't speak the language very well,' Lampard said in a Zoom press conference. 'It is something that we will work through because it is what it is.

'He hasn't had any time. Thiago turns up here pretty fresh and he is in and around us. He will learn it quickly; I am sure some players do speak the languages that he speaks in the squad.

'He speaks French, being the main one, but we have lads here who speak Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish and Italian so that one is again, if the language is a slight barrier, we need time to work. That's what we have in front of us.

'We have seen that leadership already and people are going to want to talk about the second goal and that's fair play and that's the nature of being the top player that he has been all his career, but at the same time, we saw how he is, his leadership and his qualities and we are going to see more of that.'
