Australian singles can break free from the shackles of social distancing restrictions with a free, interactive dating game that can be played from the comfort of the living room sofa.

Developed and hosted by Tinder, 'Swipe Night' - which takes place over the next three weekends in September -  follows a group of friends during the final hours before an asteroid hits earth.

As the clock counts down, users will be challenged with moral dilemmas and personal choices that impact who they match with once the game ends - but they'll need to act fast with only seven seconds to make each decision.

Key decisions are then loaded to participants' Tinder profiles, creating conversation starters and icebreakers that don't involve coronavirus or face masks.

* Saturday, September 12 from 10am to midnight on Sunday, September 13 

* Saturday, September 19 from 10am to midnight on Sunday, September 20

* Saturday, September 26 from 10am to midnight on Sunday, September 27

The game will run on the Tinder app from 10am on Saturday, September 12 to midnight on Sunday, September 13 and continue over the following two weekends.

Anyone with an active Tinder profile can play the game free of charge.

Tinder CEO Jim Lanzone sees the event as an escape from the constraints of pandemic restrictions and a chance for singles to mingle while staying 'COVID safe'.

'When lockdowns began, we saw an immediate increase in our members' engagement on Tinder, so we know we play an important role in their stay-at-home experience,' Mr Lanzone said in a statement.

'While the global health crisis continues, we believe Swipe Night can bring a welcome change of pace to our members around the world. 

'We're committed to driving innovation on Tinder that creates more ways to bring our members together, entertain them, and help them meet and get to know new people.'

'Swipe Night' first launched in the US to rave reviews in late 2019, months before the term COVID-19 was coined and 'social distancing' became part of daily vernacular.

During the interactive event, matches increased by 26 percent and messages by 12 percent compared to a typical weekend, data from Tinder revealed.

Launched on a California university campus in 2012, Tinder is now the world's most popular dating app with more than 340million downloads.

The app is available in over 40 languages in 190 countries and has roughly 6.2million subscribers worldwide.
