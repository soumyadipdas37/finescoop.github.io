Prime Minister Scott Morrison wrote to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews three times demanding he accept the help of 1000 Australian Defence Force troops to address the state's coronavirus crisis but were declined, bombshell letters have revealed.

Details of the letters obtained by Sky News through Freedom of Information laws were revealed on Wednesday night.

Mr Morrison first wrote to the Premier on July 4. 

'I note with concern that the Victorian COVID-19 case numbers have escalated to 108 cases today, as part of an increased trend of cases during the past week,' he wrote.

The Prime Minister followed up with a second letter on July 11. 

'It is critical to the containment of the virus that the now thousands of people in isolation and quarantine are carefully tracked by phone and personal visits to ensure compliance (and to ensure their welfare),” Mr Morrison stressed.

More to come.
