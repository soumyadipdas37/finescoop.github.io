She was recently linked to Roman Kemp after being spotted heading out for dinner with him and her pals.

But Mabel brushed her romance rumours aside on Wednesday night as she headed out for a girls' night with fellow singer Raye at Bob Bob Ricard restaurant in London's Soho.

The Finders Keepers singer, 24, turned heads in a busty optical illusion jumpsuit, while Raye, 22, caught the eye in a bold pink number.

Mabel showcased her enviable figure and plenty of cleavage in the skintight cream and brown number as she strutted down the street.

She boosted her height with a pair of nude heels, while she carried her essentials in a matching handbag.

The singer-songwriter upped the glam by sweeping her blonde locks into a high ponytail, while she added a sleek palette of make-up to her face.

Raye meanwhile put on a colourful display in her plunging dress, which featured a daring cut-out detail at the front.

The Please Don't Touch singer added a bold bold pair of slouchy red knee-high boots while she added a black and red handbag to her eye-catching look.

Both ladies appeared in good spirits as they emerged from the swanky eatery following a fun night together.  

Mabel's recent outing comes after she was spotted enjoying a possible date night with Roman Kemp. 

The newly single radio presenter, 27, split from his girlfriend of three years, Anne-Sophie Flury this summer.
