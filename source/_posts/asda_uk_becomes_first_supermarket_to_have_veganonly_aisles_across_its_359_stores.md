Asda has become the first UK supermarket with vegan-only aisles dedicated to plant-based products after sales rose 275 per cent.

Meat and dairy-free products were given two aisles - one for protein, sauces and condiments and another for snacks and treats.

The aisles were introduced across Asda's 359 supermarkets nationwide this week after it was revealed 17 per cent of UK households are reducing their meat intake or following a plant-based diet. 

Products on offer include an exclusive Asda own-brand range as well as brands such as Bosh, Galaxy, Mrs Crimbles and Vego.

Asda created an own-brand lentil bowl and rice bowl for £1.50 each. Galaxy chocolate in mint and cookie crumble are just £2.50 until October 25.

Another Asda exclusive is a Bosh falafel mix (120g) for £1.99. 

Meanwhile, Sainbury's sells a falafel mix (120g) for £1.20 and a vegan Galaxy bar can be bought from Morrisons in flavours caramel and sea salt, orange and caramilised hazelnut for £3.

Premium Tamarind chutney is on sale for £1.00. Products on offer include an exclusive Asda own-brand range as well as brands such as Bosh, Galaxy, Mrs Crimbles and Vego

Asda's buying manager Sarah Thornewill said: 'We understand that customers want a quick and simple shopping experience. And this shouldn't be restricted by dietary requirements.

'By merchandising all our vegan items together, we hope to save customers time and offer inspiration, whether for those following a plant-based diet, or those looking to reduce their meat consumption.'

The products used to be spread across the store and it is hoped bringing them together in one place will make the lives of vegans easier. Vegan items on chilled and frozen aisles will remain where they are.

But vegan shoppers had a mixed reaction. Melody Moon said: 'It is a good start.' But another added: 'I'd still check the ingredients. Staff haven't a clue.' 

One said: 'Asda are introducing fully vegan aisles. Finally a supermarket with sense.'

Another wrote: 'Asda adding a Vegan isle is V exciting no more hunting and looking around. Don't understand why people are ragin about it.'  

With searches for vegan lines up 275 per cent since 2019 on asda.com, some 104 new products will soon launch. 

Other items currently available on Asda.com include NOMO Vegan & Free From Nut Free Hazelnut Choc Bar for £1.60 and Squeaky Bean Vegan Nuggets which can be ordered online for £2.50.
