An Australian mother has used up leftover bolognese by serving it in loaded potato skins with Mexican-style taco ingredients, and fellow home cooks are inspired.

The woman, who lives in Newcastle, New South Wales, shared a picture of the delicious dinnertime recipe in a budget-friendly meal ideas group on Facebook, earning plenty of compliments.

'Had leftover spaghetti bolognese from last night so we're having loaded potato skins tonight. Full bellies and smiles all around,' she captioned the snap.

In the photo fellow group members could see the crispy potatoes steaming from the oven and a miscellaneous plate of toppings, including the beef bolognese with tomato sauce.

She had also included bacon bits, tortilla chips, guacamole, spring onions, corn and sour cream so her family could eat it like a plate of nachos.

The inventive idea was given a thumbs up by fellow parents who said they were going to 'copy it' for one of this week's meals.

'This looks so yummy. What a brilliant idea!' Said one woman.

'Great idea, I haven't made these for ages,' said another.

A third added: 'You've sorted me out for tonight's dinner. Good stuff'.

One replier did ask what the amateur cook does with the potato that is leftover when you cut around the skins.

To that question the original poster replied to say that she mashed it up to serve in a shepherd's pie for the following night's meals - so there is no wastage.

Many of the ingredients she worked with are commonly found inside the average household's fridge so it's an extremely inexpensive option for a family dinner.
