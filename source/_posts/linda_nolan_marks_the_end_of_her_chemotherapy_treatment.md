Linda Nolan has marked the end of her chemotherapy treatment by ringing the bell describing it as an 'amazing feeling' after her diagnosis with incurable liver cancer.

The singer, 61, who was diagnosed with secondary cancer in April alongside her sister Anne, 69, who has breast cancer, joyously rang the bell at the ward on Friday. 

Linda was seen reciting a poem before joyously ringing the bell as nurses gathered to applaud her milestone before she triumphantly gave a thumbs up to the camera.

Speaking to Hello! Magazine, Linda said: 'It was an amazing feeling and I felt so emotional, especially when all the nurses came out and cheered. It's been such a lovely day.'

She also shared the momentous occasion on Twitter, captioned: 'I RANG THE BELL TODAY!'  

Anne found out she has stage three breast cancer in April, 20 years after she was first diagnosed with the disease in 2000.

Her sister Linda discovered she had incurable liver cancer days later. 

The pop star has also battled cancer before. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006, cellulitis and lymphoedema in her arm in 2007 and secondary cancer on her pelvis in 2017.

Anne is awaiting the results of her mammogram and depending on the outcome may need surgery followed by radiotherapy.

Linda, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006, is due to have an MRI scan. 

Discussing her experience in August, Linda admitted that she was 'traumatised' by losing her hair during treatment as she detailed the side effects.

She said: 'I've got certain side effects from the chemo. I've got pins and needles in my fingers and my toes.  

'But it hasn't been too bad. I think for me personally I was traumatised losing my hair.

'At the time you feel like you're being a little bit vain but I think everybody takes it differently. 

'For a woman losing your hair is a really traumatic thing. We're not supposed to be going around bald.'

Explaining how her sister Anne was coping, Linda said: 'Anne has really had it tough because her body isn't handling the chemo so well.'

'But we're getting there, you know. She's got Maureen, our sister, to look after her. And I moved into my sister Denise's house so she could look after me.

'It's difficult, we're all devastated. We're both scared to death because we don't want to die.

'But we're doing the best we can and reiterating to everyone to go to hospital and get sorted. Because you will eventually have to get sorted and it might be too late.'  

Linda also revealed that it has been emotional looking in the mirror as it reminds her of her late sister Bernie, who tragically passed away from cancer in 2013.  

She said: 'We miss Bernie every single day. I don't think we'll ever get over it. The first time I looked in the mirror when I had my head shaved, I saw Bernie looking back at me.'

Siblings Linda and Anne, who formed part of Irish pop group The Nolans, began chemotherapy at Blackpool's Victoria Hospital in July. 

They received news of their shock diagnoses within days of each other, shortly after the sisters returned from filming a series of The Nolans Go Cruising in March.
