While the rest of the country has been dealing with coronavirus since March, the pandemic only made its way into The Bachelor mansion this week. 

And it seems Locky Gilbert isn't going to let a global pandemic get in the way of him finding The One.

'I'm not ready to give up my chance to find love,' the tattooed hunk is heard saying in a trailer for Thursday's show.

Reality bites! Virtual bubble bath dates and rose ceremonies are the new normal as The Bachelor goes into lockdown amid COVID-19 restrictions. Pictured: the cast 

The new teaser offers viewers a rare glimpse into Locky's home life, as well as the ladies vying for his affection.   

One scene even shows an excited Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29, overjoyed at the opportunity to see Locky in the bath as they share a romantic virtual date. 

'I'm just hoping that he doesn't have too many bubbles,' she says, grinning 

Moments later Locky is heard saying, 'Let's get out before we get too pruny.'

And it seems viewers haven't seen the last of Roxi Kenny's outbursts - with the tattooed bombshell set to unleash again during a zoom call.

'I feel miserable right now. I feel like maybe Locky will send me home. I don't even want to film anymore. God!' she says to the camera before storming off.

It comes after Osher Günsberg told Locky and the remaining ladies that a global pandemic had been declared during Wednesday's episode.

'A lot's changed since you've been here at the mansion,' he explained.

'And as always, your health and wellbeing is absolutely paramount to everybody making this show, and they will do what is needed to keep you safe while you're here.
