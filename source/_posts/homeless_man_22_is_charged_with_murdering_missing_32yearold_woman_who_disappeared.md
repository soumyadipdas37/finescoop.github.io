A homeless man has been charged with the murder of a 32-year-old woman who disappeared in Exeter more than a week ago.

Christopher Mayer, 22, was charged by police on Friday evening and will appear before Exeter Magistrates' Court today.

Lorraine Cox was last seen in Exeter city centre in the early hours of Tuesday, September 1, and was reported missing two days later.

Ms Cox, a Type 1 diabetic, had left her vital medical kit left at home, which sparked concern among her friends.

Police erected Special Operations Tents in Mary Arches Street, Exeter, Devon, on Thursday as they launched a murder investigation

Five other men were arrested along with Mayer and have been released on bail until October 7.

Devon and Cornwall Police say Ms Cox's family are being kept informed of any updates and are being supported by trained officers.

They have asked for their privacy to be respected.

Detective Chief Inspector Lee Nattrass, from the major crime investigation team, said that extensive searches were taking place in and around Mary Arches Street in Exeter city centre.
