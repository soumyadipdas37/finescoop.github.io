Jennifer Hawkins has gushed over her husband Jake Wall during his first Father's Day on Saturday.

The former Miss Universe Australia, 36, thanked the 37-year-old for being a 'caring, loving and silly dad' to their ten-month-old daughter Frankie in a sweet post shared to her Instagram post.

As well uploading a number of snaps the adorable daughter and daddy duo together, Jennifer also shared a sweet clip of Jake unwrapping a present sweetly gifted to him by the youngster. 

'Partner in crime!' Jennifer Hawkins, 36, has gushed over her husband Jake Wall during his first Father's Day on Saturday

Jennifer captioned the images: 'Happy 1st Dad’s Day! Thanks for being such a caring, loving and silly dad to Frankie. (And partner in crime w all things baby inc explosions from both ends daily- ETC!! ) We love you!! xx'

On a brief clip shared to her Stories, the former beauty pageant winner was heard giggling as Jake opened a Father's Day gift.      

This comes after Jennifer and Jake reportedly purchased another renovation project, just weeks after selling their $20million Sydney mansion - despite claiming that they do not want to be known as 'property flippers.' 

According to The Daily Telegraph, the supermodel and her property developer husband purchased the 1950s home in Sydney's Northern Beaches for $6.95million.

Speaking to WSFM's Jonesy And Amanda last month, Jennifer insisted that she and her builder husband are nothing like 'flippers' - a term describing people who buy and quickly resell properties for the purpose of generating profit.

'We don't really house flip. I don't know where that [came from],' the mother-of-one said, adding that her decisions to purchase and offload properties have always been motivated by 'life changes' rather than profit.

'It's kind of like, we would just find an amazing piece of land. Jake's a builder so we had that passion, and then something in our life would change and we'd want to move to a different area,' she explained.

'So we would sell it after maybe three to four, five years. But it seems like a quick amount of time, but yeah, no definitely not house flipping,' Jennifer added.

Jennifer and Jake's latest reported new renovation property, was previously owned by Dame Joan Sutherland and is the peninsula's largest oceanfront estate.

It was listed in 2018 for $8million, but failed to sell and ­returned to the market earlier this year.

The spacious home is set on 3,100sqm of land with expansive ocean and coastal views. Daily Mail Australia have contacted Jennifer Hawkins for comment.

Jennifer first entered the property market in 2006, two years after she was crowned Miss Universe.

The beauty forked out $469,000 for a double-storey house in Merewether, a suburb located in her home city of Newcastle.

She leased out the three-bedroom, two-bathroom property for much of the time it was in her name, before she eventually sold the residence for $782,000 in 2017.

Clearly bitten by the real estate bug, savvy Jennifer added two properties to her portfolio in 2007.

In January of that year, she bought another home in Newcastle's Merewether area for the sum of $620,000.

Like her first property close by, the house was double-storey and featured three bedrooms and two bathrooms.

Jennifer leased out the address for $530 per week, before she sold it in 2015 for $731,000.

Meanwhile, the second property Jennifer purchased in 2007 was a two-bedroom apartment in Sydney's Bondi.

She bought the swanky condo off the plan for $895,000, before living at the address with Jake for several years.

It appeared they tired of the eastern suburbs some time later, selling the property in 2014 for $1.2 million.

By this time, Jennifer and Jake had already begun to build homes, rather than simply buy them.

In 2010, the couple purchased a cliff-side block of land in North Curl Curl for a whopping $1.3 million.

They then partnered with renowned architect Koichi Takada to create a stunning three-storey mansion.

The couple sold the North Curl Curl home in 2014, for a jaw-dropping $4.1 million.

In the meantime, Jennifer and Jake bought another block of land in the same suburb and had already commenced building another incredible mansion.

They paid $1.66 million in 2013 for the block, which had an old weatherboard house on it.

The couple demolished the house, before Jake's company J Group project again collaborated with Koichi Takada to build another home.

Jennifer and Jake sold the North Curl Curl residence for around $5 million in 2016.

The couple then traded up to their latest pad, a mansion located in Sydney's exclusive Northern Beaches suburb of Newport.

The home was built on a plot of land bought for $4 million by the couple in 2014.

Jennifer and Jake sold the stunning mansion for $20 million in June this year, six months after listing it on the market. 

Billionaire software tycoon Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie purchased the mansion for a record $24.5million.
