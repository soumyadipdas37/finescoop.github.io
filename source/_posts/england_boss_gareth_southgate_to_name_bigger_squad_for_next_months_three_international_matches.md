England manager Gareth Southgate will name an extended squad on Thursday to ensure he can rotate players during this month’s international triple header.

Southgate, who will almost certainly recall Harry Maguire, usually selects a party of 23. But he is expected to name a bigger squad to ease the workload for his squad.

There are concerns from Premier League managers over the fitness of their players following a gruelling period since the restart in June.

Tottenham, in particular, are enduring an energy-sapping start to the season that will see them play eight games in 22 days and manager Jose Mourinho, speaking ahead of his side’s Europa League qualifier against Maccabi Haifa tonight, has warned Southgate to go easy on his players.

England face three home games in seven days, taking on Wales in a friendly before Nations League matches against Belgium a week on Sunday and Denmark on October 14.

Southgate is aware of the issues he faces regarding player welfare but has, more often than not, started with his strongest available XI — particularly in competitive matches.

With next summer’s Euros in mind, the England boss will want his best players involved as often as possible. But the prospect of playing three matches in a week means he will almost certainly rotate his team.

United captain Maguire will be recalled to the squad following his Greek court drama. The defender was dropped from the squad to face Iceland and Denmark last month after being found guilty on three separate offences following an altercation with Greek police during a holiday on Mykonos.

Maguire has since successfully appealed for a re-trial and, as Sportsmail revealed on Saturday, Southgate is ready to recall his key central defender.

Leicester attacker Harvey Barnes has also caught Southgate’s eye in recent months. The forward was excellent in front of the England boss in his side’s 5-2 win over Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday.

With Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden missing out — after being sent home in disgrace following England’s victory over Iceland last month for secretly bringing two women into the team hotel — Barnes could come into the reckoning.

Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be hoping for the call following his excellent start to the season.

Marcus Rashford, Ben Chilwell and Harry Winks are also expected to return after recovering from injury, but Kyle Walker’s place is in doubt following his red card in Iceland.

Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are set to miss out through injury.
