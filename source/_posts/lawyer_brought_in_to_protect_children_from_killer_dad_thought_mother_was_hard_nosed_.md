John Edwards (pictured), 67, killed his daughter Jennifer, 13, and his son Jack, 15, in West Pennant Hills in Sydney's north-west on July 5, 2018

A lawyer acting for two children who were later shot dead by their evil father ignored their claims he had beaten them and labelled their mother a 'hard nosed bi***', an inquest has heard. 

Edwards, 67, killed his daughter Jennifer, 13, and his son Jack, 15, in West Pennant Hills in Sydney's north-west on July 5, 2018.

Edwards then returned to his rented home in nearby Normanhurst and took his own life just hours after the cowardly attack.

Their murders came after a bitter custody dispute from March 2016 to February 2018 where a number of domestic abuse allegations were levelled at Edwards. 

His estranged wife and the children's mother Olga, who won full custody on Valentine's Day 2018, died by suicide five months after the killings.

An inquest into the murders began at the NSW Coroners Court on Monday September 7 and Edwards' violent history was exposed.  

On Tuesday, the court heard from a family psychologist who previously advised the children's lawyer she feared Edwards was a dangerous narcissist, The Australian reported.

Edwards' estranged wife and the children's mother Olga, who won full custody on Valentine's Day 2018, died by suicide five months after the killings 

The psychologist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, personally feared retribution from Edwards for even making the assessment.

The psychologist saw all members of the family between 2017 and 2018 amid the custody battle.

The two children told the psychologist they did not want to see their dad and detailed horrific living conditions when with their father.  

But the children's lawyer told the psychologist that the children's mother Olga presented as a 'hard nosed b*tch in court'. 

The psychologist told the lawyer she didn't agree with the assessment, before making a note of the comment. 

The psychologist felt the lawyer ignored the children's pleas to steer clear of their father.  

She said she had been misrepresented in emails claiming the teenagers would be taken from their mother if she didn't facilitate visits with their father. 

The psychologist said that both Jack (pictured right) and Jennifer (pictured left) expressed their desire not to see their father in the lead up to their callous murders 

'If I didn't feel they were safe enough to be in a joint session, how would I feel they would be safe living with him?' she said. 

On one occasion Jack told her his father was often at the tipping point of physical rage.

Edwards had admitted to physical violence against his children including bending fingers back and a 'clip over the ear' but he denied allegations of more severe abuse.

He described Jennifer as his 'perfect little angel' in one session and tried to get Jack to go on a holiday with him before Olga, fearing for her son's safety, intervened.

The inquest continues.
