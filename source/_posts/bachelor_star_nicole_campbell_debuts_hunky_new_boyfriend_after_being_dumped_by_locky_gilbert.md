Nicole, who received the triple threat rose in the premiere of the season, said her intense feelings toward Locky began to fade once the cast were forced to leave the mansion due to the outbreak of coronavirus.  

'What people don't know is there was a massive period of time in between leaving the mansion and commencing the 'Love In Lockdown' virtual dating,' she said.

Nicole said due to the time spent apart, she and Locky 'fizzled out'.

'When we got back to filming "Love In lockdown", I was just like *groans* I don't think it's there,' she admitted. 

'As soon as you stop filming in the mansion, and as soon as you're out of the bubble, it snaps you back into reality. Yeah he was cool, but nah.'
