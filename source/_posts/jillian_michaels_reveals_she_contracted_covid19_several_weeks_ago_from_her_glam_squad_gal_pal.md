The Biggest Loser alum Jillian Michaels revealed Tuesday that she contracted the coronavirus 'several weeks ago' from her glam squad gal pal.

'I haven't even spoken about this publicly really, and a very close friend of mine gave me COVID several weeks ago,' the 46-year-old Daytime Emmy nominee told Fox Business host Liz Claman.

'I literally get my guard down for an hour with one of my best friends who does my hair and makeup and got it. It's just that simple. So if you're not in a mask and that person is not in a mask, and they have COVID and have no idea.

'Because, by the way, I had no idea that I had it for six days [and] my friend had no idea that she had it when she gave it to me.'

Jillian continued: 'I'm fortunate to have gone into it being healthy and I was able to get on the other side of it pretty quick. But not everyone is that lucky, as we know.'

Michaels (born McKarus) discouraged people from exercising in gyms, even if pandemic restrictions have been lifted in your city.

'Anticipate that you will likely get it in an environment like that,' the LA fitness expert explained.

'All I can tell you is if you are afraid of getting COVID, a public gym is probably a place where you will get it. And I would love to tell you that's not the case.'

As of Tuesday, there have reportedly been 6.34M confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States of America leading to 190K deaths. 

Business from Jillian's subscription fitness app has 'gone up 30 percent' since quarantine, and she reminded people 'you don't need these pieces of equipment to work out at home.'

Michaels noted: 'You have your own body weight and you can use it in a million different ways literally to get a superior workout.'  

Her children are safe: Jillian has 40–60 custody of daughter Lukensia (R), 10; and son Phoenix (L), 8; from her nine-year domestic partnership with ex-fiancée Heidi Rhoades, which ended in June 2018 (pictured May 4)
