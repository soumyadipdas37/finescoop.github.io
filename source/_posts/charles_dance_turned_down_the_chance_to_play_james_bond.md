Debonair, athletic and with a penchant for glamorous women, Charles Dance could easily pass for an older James Bond. 

Now he has revealed that he turned down the chance to play 007 and admitted: ‘I would have f***** it up.’

Dance, 73, who was recently pictured on a beach break kissing a woman, thought to be Italian film producer Alessandra Masi, 53, was invited to an audition when Bond producers were seeking to replace Roger Moore.

But his agent advised him not to go, he told the Financial Times, adding: ‘She said, “I urge you not to do it. 

"One, think how you’ll feel if you don’t get it and, two, I think it will limit your career.” ’

The actor, who had earlier played a baddie called Claus in the 1981 Bond film For Your Eyes Only, agreed, saying: ‘I think she was being kind. 

'I had not nearly enough experience for something like that – and I would have f***** it up.’

However, his association with the secret agent did continue when he played Bond’s creator, Ian Fleming, in an ITV drama about the writer’s life in 1989.
