Aaron Rodgers said he had an 'increased love of life' and was 'in a lot better head space' Tuesday during an interview following his recent split from Danica Patrick.

The 36-year-old football star opened up while on The Pat McAfee Show after a caller asked why he appeared 'rejuvenated' during the 2020 football season.

'I have just a new and increased love of life and I have made decisions and changes and habits that put me in a lot better head space,' Aaron responded.

'There's just a lot of things that have come together in my life over the last few months that have really been enjoyable and reminded me, given me perspective, on life and in football to view things through the most positive lens that I possibly can,' Aaron added.

The Green Bay Packers quarterback added: 'That's why I'm having so much fun, and it starts with love. And then surround yourself with people that you really enjoy'.

Aaron even cited his weekly participation on The Pat McAfee Show as an example of his new outlook because of his 'love' for show collaborator, friend and former teammate AJ Hawk and respect for Pat.

He said that he looks forward to joining the show each week and called it 'another step' in the process of self-growth.

'It's mindfulness and positivity and love and kindness and integrity. Just putting it all together, I think for me, has made me a lot happier and I'm just enjoying football and enjoying life a lot more,' he said.
