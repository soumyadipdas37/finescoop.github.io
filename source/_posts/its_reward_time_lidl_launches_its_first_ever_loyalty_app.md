Lidl has launched its first ever smartphone loyalty rewards app, promising shoppers discounts on its own-brand products, cinema tickets and Sky TV packages.

The German-based discount supermarket said shoppers using the new app, called 'Lidl Plus', will be able to get 'scratch card' prizes, ranging from 25p to up to £20 off their weekly shop.

Customers will have a one in five chance of a win on the 'scratch card' with each purchase, Lidl claimed today. 

New app: Lidl has launched its first ever loyalty app for shoppers today 

Features: Lidl app shoppers will be able to enjoy a range of discounts, prizes and offers

Every week, shoppers using Lidl's new app will also get new single-use coupons to use on their next shop, with some discounts of up to 25 per cent on selected products. 

'All coupons are for one-use only and have an expiry date of two weeks from when you active them', Lidl added. 

The launch of the app will put pressure on the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer, who all offer customers various loyalty and rewards schemes in a bid to try and keep shoppers' cash coming in.

Lidl promises that its new app will offer shoppers 'exclusive rewards and discounts every time they scan their digital card at the till.'

Christian Härtnagel, chief executive at Lidl GB, said: 'Our customers know that we offer the best quality products at market leading prices. 

'We've designed Lidl Plus so we can provide an even better, tailored, shopping experience for our customers, as well as to thank them for their loyalty.'

Lidl Plus will also be launching a 'Coupon Plus' feature where customers will get bonus money-off coupons to use on their next shop when they reach a certain target. The name of the game, according to Lidl, will be, 'the more they spend, the more they save.'

The app will also dish out special offers on products and services, including up to 40 per cent off Sky TV and broadband, and up to 40 per cent off cinema tickets.  

Shoppers can also use the app to store all their digital receipts in one place, as well as browse weekly leaflets and seasonal magazines on the go.

Anyone interested in using Lidl's new app can download it via the App Store or Google Play. To activate the loyalty app, shoppers need to register online and provide certain details like an email address and telephone number. 

The new app cannot be used in Northern Ireland.
