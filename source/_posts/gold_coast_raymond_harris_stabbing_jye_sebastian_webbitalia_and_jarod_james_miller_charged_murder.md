The lawyer of a man accused of murdering father Raymond Harris, 27, has said that his client is 'shocked' by the allegations and has no history of violence. 

Jye Sebastian Webb-Italia, 18, and Jarod James Miller, 21, were both charged with one count of murder and three counts of common assault over the alleged stabbing on the Gold Coast on Wednesday night.  

Webb-Italia was represented by TWC Lawyer's Rodney Keyte in Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday morning. 

His face-tattooed friend Miller also appeared in court and made a Legal Aid application to get representation from a lawyer.   

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Keyte said his client Webb-Italia and his family were 'in a world of shock'.

Raymond Harris (pictured), 27, was stabbed to death during a fight with a number of men that were known to him on Cavill Avenue near Orchid Avenue in Surfers Paradise at 9pm on Wednesday

'He's obviously in shock as is his family. This is something, I'm instructed, that's never happened before.' he said. 

'Jye has obviously taken everything by shock. He's cut off from his family. It's hit him very hard.' 

Mr Harris suffered a stab wound to the torso after an alleged brawl in Surfers Paradise on Wednesday night. 

But Mr Keyte said the police allegations against Webb-Italia are 'very murky'.      

'What the police are alleging seems to be very murky,' he said. 

'They're going off CCTV footage and the action what they're describing is a slashing motion.' 

The lawyer confirmed a knife had been found near the scene but said there was no proof that it was the murder weapon.    

'A knife has been found within the vicinity of the deceased, it hasn't been confirmed that it was the murder weapon or even involved in the incident at all,' Mr Keyte said.

Webb-Italia appeared in court on Thursday morning and his case was adjourned until October 15. 

The 18-year-old's co-accused Miller also appeared in court and will face court via videolink on October 15, unless he gets legal representation before then. 

Miller is a father of a young daughter and has facial tattoos on each side of his face. 

The tattoo on his right cheek says 'Stay true. BR. Laugh with many. Trust none', while the left cheek reads 'Damaged. No regrets'. 

He also has a number of tattoos on his arms and legs, including a number of skulls on his left leg and an anarchy symbol on his left knee.   

The victim, Mr Harris, was allegedly involved in an altercation with a number of men that were known to him on Cavill Avenue near Orchid Avenue in Surfers Paradise at 9pm on Wednesday.

He suffered a stab wound to the torso and rushed to the Gold Coast University Hospital but died a short time later.

The mother of Raymond's young daughter posted a tribute on Thursday morning. 

'I'll never be able to handle the fact that my little girl will never get to see her daddy again,' she wrote. 

'I'm so thankful that Hannie has you in her life and I'll forever be grateful of the happiness you brung to our daughter and that you loved her endlessly. 

'Rest In Peace Raymond, you'll be missed.'  

Footage captured on Wednesday night showed the chaos as police cars surrounded the area. 

A Polair Helicopter flew around the vicinity and there were reports officers stopped and searched cars in the area. 

Eventually, police officers found Webb-Italia and Miller nearby and arrested them before charging both of them with murder and assault on Thursday morning.

It's understood children witnessed the alleged assault and stabbing.

'It was rather traumatic seeing it unfold...  There was a family with two children under five with their mum and dad,' one man wrote.

Another bystander came across the scene after finishing work.

'When I walked over at the end of my shift he was lying on the floor bleeding out, blood everywhere - the poor guy looked lifeless,' they wrote.

A local expressed concern about the safety of their neighbourhood.  

Two alleged stabbings have occurred around Orchard Avenue (pictured) in Surfers Paradise in the past 24 hours 

'I fear for mine and my partners life EVERY TIME we leave the house.... I can't wait to leave,' she wrote.

The incident is the second alleged stabbing on the Gold Coast in only 24 hours.

A 17-year-old woman was charged by police over the alleged stabbing of a 30-year-old man around Caville Mall at around 4am on Wednesday morning.

The man had been walking through the area when a fight allegedly broke out among a group of women.
