She is an advocate for body confidence and uses her social media platform to encourage other women to love the skin they're in.

And Malin Andersson did just that on Saturday as she proudly showed off her cellulite while modelling skimpy thong lingerie.

The Love Island star, 27, looked amazing as she sent an empowering message to her fans on Instagram, penning: 'This is a reminder to appreciate every bit of yourself.'

In her post, Malin shared two side-by-side pictures of herself in white underwear, with her leg in the left snap showing a much smoother appearance than in the right. 

The beauty looked confident in the snap as she modelled the bra and thong combo, while taking a mirror selfie over her shoulder.

Highlighting the difference between the images, Malin wrote: 'Some cellulite to a bit more cellulite within a tense of the leg...It’s like magic. Just without the photoshop!'

And in an encouraging statement to her followers, she added: 'BASICALLY... this is a reminder to APPRECIATE every bit of yourself. Whatever angle, lighting or positioning.'

Her post was met with a plethora of comments from fans, thanking her for continuing to promote body positivity.

It comes after Malin revealed that she's now 'looking for love' and has started 'going on dates again' after her abusive ex-boyfriend Tom Kemp was jailed earlier this month.  

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said: 'To be fair, do you know what, I am. I have recently started going on dates again which I haven't done for over a year. So I am looking for love - how about that?'

Malin, who also spoke about body positivity at the Lovehoney virtual love camp, added: 'I do want a family - I want a husband. 

'I want a good-looking little basketball player. I do like a basketball player and I want my family. I want a few kids maybe one or two I want a little dog.' 

Malin was last in a relationship with Tom and the couple welcomed daughter Consy in December 2019, who tragically passed away.

The couple split in 2019 after a violent relationship, and earlier this month, Tom was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year.

But Tom, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.    

Back in the dating game: 'I have recently started going on dates again which I haven't done for over a year. So I am looking for love - how about that?' 

Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.

Malin has spoken candidly about her grief and also works as a carer, after returning to the job as she felt a 'void' while away from the sector. 

Speaking about lockdown, she told MailOnline: 'I kept myself busy - I was volunteering with the caring work, I was doing mental health lives everyday on my Instagram.' 

'Living alone was fine by me I think it gave me a good time to do a lot more work on myself so I think I benefitted from it.'
