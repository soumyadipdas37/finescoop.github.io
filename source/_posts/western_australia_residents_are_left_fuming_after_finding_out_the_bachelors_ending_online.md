Many residents of Western Australia accidentally found out who The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert had picked as his winner before they had a chance to watch the show themselves. 

While the show is aired at the same time across all States, WA is two hours behind New South Wales, Melbourne and Queensland.

And with social media buzzing after Locky picked Irena Srbinovska over Bella Varelis during Thursday's nail-biting finale, many WA residents where left fuming that the ending of the show was spoiled for them.   

Annoying! Many residents of Western Australia accidentally found out who The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert had picked as his winner before they had a chance to watch the show themselves

'Mate, Bachelor hasn't aired yet in WA,' one person commented on Instagram.

Others told the woman that it happened every year and she should have known better and stayed off social media.

Meanwhile, after weeks of speculation that Locky had already split from his winner, he and his stunning girlfriend Irena took to their Instagram platforms shortly after the finale to confirm they were still together and very much in love. 

In fact, nurse Irena, 31, is so smitten with the 30-year-old that has also revealed that she's packed up her belongings at her Melbourne home to officially move in with the love of her life at his home in Perth.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph about starting afresh with the adrenaline junkie, Irena confessed: 'I have left my job, I have left my family and friends and the only city that I have lived in.'

Irena excitedly continued: 'I have found a job in Perth and can’t wait to start living the rest of my life with Locky.'

'Here is to one crazy adventure and so so many more with you babe.'

Thursday night's emotion-filled finale of the popular dating series saw Locky choose Irena as his winner.

In a twist no one saw coming, the 30-year-old had told both Irena and Bella Varelis that he had fallen in love with them - leading both to believe they had won his heart.

But ultimately, it was down to earth nurse Irena who stole the burly adventure man's heart - leaving Bella completely devastated.

After a distraught Bella stormed off the set, Locky came face-to-face with Irena to give her the good news - telling her he 'couldn't wait' to spend the rest of his life with her.

'Irena,' he began. 'Every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that.

'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole, whole package.’

Locky had placed viewers on the edge of their seat, when he admitted he had his doubts.

Lock said: 'Every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that'

'However, my biggest fear is that you're not gonna be able to put yourself first, or tell me no. And in my partner I want drive and ambition,' he said.

But then he turned to Irena and said: 'And I think you've got that in spades. When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'

'I love you too,' she beamed in response.
