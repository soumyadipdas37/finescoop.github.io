David Alaba is yet to agree a new Bayern Munich contract and wants to leave in this transfer window so the club receive a fee for him. 

The defender has just one year remaining on his current deal at the club and would be able to leave for free next summer. 

According to BILD, the 28-year-old wants to ensure Bayern, the club he has spent his entire senior career, picks up a transfer fee if they cannot agree improved terms.

Manchester United and Chelsea have both previously been linked with the Austrian, who played 40 times for Bayern last season, a campaign that culminated in their Champions League triumph.

Sky Germany reported last month that Alaba's advisors had held contract talks in Lisbon with Bayern chiefs, and an offer of £13.5m-a-year was rejected.

It is believed the two parties are some way off with Alaba keen to become one of the club's top earners which currently includes Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller.

The vastly experienced and versatile defender would be an attractive prospect for a number of sides across Europe, particularly on a cut price deal.

It remains to be see what kind of transfer fee would be acceptable to Bayern. The German champions are demanding £27million from Thiago Alcantara's suitors and he has the same amount of time left on his contract. 

Alaba has played in central midfield, central defence and on the wing but his primary role is as at left-back. 

Given that Chelsea have just splashed out on Ben Chilwell it seems unlikely that Roman Abramovich would sanction the sale to continue the Blues' spending spree. 

Alaba is eager to have his future sorted as swiftly as possible but he faces a race against time for a resolution before the new season begins. 

Bayern host Schalke at the Allianz Arena on September 18 to launch their title defence.
