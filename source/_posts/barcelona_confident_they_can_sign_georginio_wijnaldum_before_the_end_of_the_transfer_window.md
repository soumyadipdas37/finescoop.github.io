Barcelona are reportedly confident they will sign Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum before the October transfer deadline day.

Ronald Koeman has made the Dutchman a top target, having built a strong rapport with him from the time he was in charge of the national team.

Wijnaldum has entered the final year of his contract at Anfield, and Liverpool are reportedly reluctant to lose him for nothing next summer and could be backed into a corner over their man. 

Georginio Wijnaldum could be set to leave Liverpool and join Ronald Koeman at Barcelona

Goal have now reported that given the circumstances, the Blaugrana are confident they can lure Wijnaldum to the Nou Camp before the deadline of October 5.   

Koeman is determined to sign the 29-year-old as he looks to freshen up the team after a disastrous 2019-20 campaign.

Barcelona have not yet put an offer in for Wijnaldum as they look to sell before bringing any players in.

Ivan Rakitic has already departed to Sevilla, while Arturo Vidal is set to join Inter Milan and Luis Suarez looks likely to join Juventus.

There has been no sign from Wijnaldum, either, that he is unsettled or wants to agitate for a move but there is little doubt that Barcelona want to add his experience as they begin the process of rebuilding in the wake of their Champions League calamity.

Wijnaldum didn't give away much when he asked about the move ahead of the Netherlands' clash with Poland saying: 'It’s a rumour, I have nothing to say about it.'

Koeman is a big fan of Wijnaldum from his days working as the Dutch national manager

Since his arrival from Newcastle in 2016, only Roberto Firmino has played more Premier League minutes than Wijnaldum.

In that time he has made 187 appearances and won the Champions League and Premier League. 

Given his standing in the squad at Liverpool, they would look to recoup the £25m fee they spent on Wijnaldum. Should they do that, it would then pave the way for a move for Thiago.

The Spain midfielder has his heart set on moving to Anfield. He is in a similar contractual position to Wijnaldum, in that he has entered the last 12 months and Bayern Munich have made it clear they want £30m for him.
