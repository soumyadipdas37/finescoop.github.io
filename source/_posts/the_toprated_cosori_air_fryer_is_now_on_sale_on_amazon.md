If you're looking to lighten up on the calories and cook healthier meals at home, then an air fryer is your solution. 

Essentially a small oven, an air fryer circulates hot air around the food cooking it with next to no oil and in record time. With minimal moisture, your food also comes out wonderfully crispy- but with fewer calories. A healthier alternative to a deep fat fryer, you can enjoy your favourite meals but with far less oil. 

If you haven't tried an air fryer before or looking to replace an old model, then the Cosori Air Fryer is an impressive option. The Cosori Air Fryer has gained lots of attention from Amazon shoppers, with over 800 ratings and a near-perfect score of 4.8 out of 5.

What's more, you can now nab the top-rated air fryer for only £67.99 on Amazon- that's a saving of £22. 

You can now get the highly-rated Cosori Air Fryer for £67.99 - that's a saving of 24 per cent off 

Food cooked in the Cosori Air Fryer contains up to 85 per cent less fat than traditionally fried foods without losing the delicious tastes and crispy textures.

What's more, if you're partial to fried food but hate the way the smell lingers in your house, this is a clever, less smelly solution. With cooking time faster than a conventional oven and with crispier and tastier results, it's easy to see why 84 per cent of Amazon shoppers have awarded the Corosri Air Fryer the full five stars. 

Unlike its round competitors, the Corsori Air Fryer has a square basket which makes for bigger cooking space. Amazon shoppers have agreed that the 3.5-litre air fryer is plenty big enough for three people servings and while roomy, it's low profile means it can be easily stored under your kitchen cabinet when not in use.

'We have had this air fryer for over six months now, and we absolutely love it! Amazed at how well it cooks. The basket is roomy, good for 2 or 3 people servings, and both parts are easy to clean or put in the dishwasher. 

'It is not especially quiet during use, but not objectionable. I have made small loaves of bread, cakes and pastries, great chips made with real potatoes, and they have all cooked beautifully and evenly, at a lower temperature.'

Amazon shoppers have also awarded points to the Cosori for its versatility. The built-in digital one-touch screen menu features 11 settings including steak, chicken, frozen foods, French fries, vegetables and even bread. Thanks to its ability to bake, roast and fry, it makes dinner time a whole lot easier.

If you're worried about washing up, then you'll be pleased to hear that the removable non-stick coated basket is dishwasher safe too, so you can just bung it in with all your other utensils and pans. 

'This has probably become the most used kitchen appliance we have ever owned. I for one love the way it cooks and the fact that things are beautifully crisp and still taste fresh and like they are supposed to taste, but it's clean too, no (limited) oil and the non-stick surface makes cleaning a doddle, even for me!.'

With food cooked in the Cosori Air Fryer containing less than 85 per cent less fat, you can still enjoy your favourite foods with a fraction of the calories.   

'Hassle-free, flavour-filled, no-mess cooking. Still getting around to experimenting with what to cook in it but I christened it with homemade chips and following the instructions in the manual provided I ended up with lovely crispy chips and next to no mess. I've also cooked a small beef joint and roasted veg in it, both bringing out better flavours than my oven does.'
