Yorkshire have sanctioned an independent investigation into allegations of institutional racism from former captain Azeem Rafiq.

Rafiq, 29, revealed in an interview with ESPNCricinfo that his experiences during two stints as a contracted player at Headingley left him 'close to suicide'.

Rafiq, who was captain to both Joe Root and Ben Stokes at England Under 19 level, said that, as a Muslim, he was made to feel like an 'outsider' and left on the brink of suicide.

'I know how close I was to committing suicide during my time at Yorkshire,' he said.

'I was living my family's dream as a professional cricketer but inside I was dying. I was dreading going to work. I was in pain every day.

'There were times I did things to try and fit in that, as a Muslim, I now look back on and regret. I'm not proud of it at all.

'But as soon as I stopped trying to fit in, I was an outsider. Do I think there is institutional racism? It's at its peak in my opinion. It's worse than it's ever been.'

In response, Yorkshire chairman Roger Hutton said in a statement: 'Any allegation of this nature is hugely concerning to everyone from the board to the playing staff here, and we take the reports very seriously.Â

'The club took the decision to launch a formal investigation into the specific allegations made by Azeem Rafiq, and a wider review of (our) policies and culture.

'We fully acknowledge that just as in many walks of life, sport, including cricket and Yorkshire as a club, must do better to fully promote a culture of zero tolerance to racism or any form of prejudice.'

Although Rafiq did not name individuals in referencing several episodes of alleged racism, he said: 'Yorkshire don't want to listen and they don't want to change.

'And part of the reason for that is the people who were involved in the incidents I'm talking about are still at the club. They just want to sweep it under the carpet.

'But not this time. Not again. I know what I'm doing here. I know that by speaking out I'm damaging my chances of working in the game again. But I also know it's the right thing to do and if I have to stand alone to do it, I will.'

Yorkshire board member Hanif Malik, the Equality and Diversity Committee chair, has been in contact with Rafiq and would, said Hutton, continue dialogue 'in the weeks ahead, as it's important that we hear his grievances in as much detail as possible'.

Rafiq said that people who were involved in the incidents he is referring to are still at Yorkshire

Rafiq was first released by Yorkshire in 2014, just two years after becoming the county's youngest-ever captain, leading them in six Twenty20 matches.

Subsequent trials with Sussex and Derbyshire did not result in contract offers for the off-spinner and following a season of league cricket, he was re-signed midway through 2016 and spent two further seasons at Yorkshire before being let go for a second time with a clutch of other senior players like Liam Plunkett, Jack Brooks and Andrew Hodd.

He is no longer involved in the professional game.

Rafiq said during a previous interview with Wisden Cricket Monthly that earlier in his career, when walking on to the field with close friends Adil Rashid, Ajmal Shahzad and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan, a team-mate commented: 'There's too many of you lot. We need to have a word about that.'

In referencing several allegations of inappropriate behaviour, Rafiq revealed: 'I'm talking some very high-profile players here. Some very high-profile administrators and media figures.'

Rafiq jumped to the defence of Darren Gough, who he says has been of great support to him

He added that he had one captain who was openly racist. However, he leapt to the defence of Darren Gough when he said: 'Goughy has been a great support for me, from picking me to supporting me over last few years. Barnsley lads.'

Rafiq's accusations come in the week that incoming ECB chairman Ian Watmore admitted the lack of non-white faces on the governing body's 12-strong board was unacceptable.

In July, the ECB announced a new inclusion and diversity strategy, incorporating a game-wide anti-discrimination charter, with chief executive Tom Harrison saying English cricket 'had to confront some uncomfortable truths in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement'.

This followed research that showed the professional game now has only nine black players and two support staff in comparison to 33 black players 25 years ago.
