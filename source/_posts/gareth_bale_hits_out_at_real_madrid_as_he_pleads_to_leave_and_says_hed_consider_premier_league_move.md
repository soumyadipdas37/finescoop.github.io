Gareth Bale has hit out at Real Madrid for making it 'very difficult' for him to leave and admitted he would consider a return to the Premier League.

The Wales international has been frozen out at Madrid by boss Zinedine Zidane and the club are said to be desperate to get him off their wage bill.

Bale, who joined Madrid in a then world-record £85million deal from Tottenham in 2013, only played 20 times in all competitions last season and has become frustrated with the club's handling of his potential departure.

Gareth Bale has insisted Real Madrid have been 'very difficult' is allowing him to leave

The 31-year-old forward has previously been linked with a move to Manchester United and former club Tottenham and revealed he would be open to the idea of coming back to England. 

Speaking to Sky Sports, Bale also admitted that Madrid thwarted his mega-money move to the Chinese Super League back in January.

He said: 'Last year they blocked everything at the last second so it was a project that I was excited for last year but it didn’t materialise so there have been other incidents when we’ve tried to go but the club wouldn’t allow it or have done something so yeah as for the club what can I say. 

'I want to play and I’m still motivated to play football so I guess it’s on the club really. I can’t really do much, they are in control of everything. I have a contract so all I can do is carry on doing what I’m doing and hopefully something comes up.

Wales star admitted he would consider a return to the Premier League if offer was on the table

Bale left England in 2013 after joining Madrid from Tottenham for a then world-record £85m

'As I’ve said it’s in the club’s hands and they make it very difficult, to be honest.' Asked if he is keen to move to the Premier League again, Bale added: 'As I said it’s not really in my hands, I think it’s one of those situations if offers arrived it would be something I’d look at for sure but we will have to see what happens. 

'We have got plenty of time left in this transfer window and others as well but time will tell. Mainly the reason is the decision is in Real Madrid’s hands.'

Sportsmail understands that Bale's departure from Madrid is likely to be frustrated by the club's reluctance to pay off the remaining two years of his salary.

Bale's €17million (£15.1m) salary over his remaining two years would mean Madrid would have to negotiate a possible €34m (£30.2m) pay-off which they are not in a position to do.

Madrid have expressed a desire to offload Bale for the past two years but their urgency to get rid of him this summer has been somewhat diminished with the departure of James Rodríguez to Everton.

Bale is now on international duty with Wales and national team boss Ryan Giggs said he would speak to the winger about his situation in Spain given his peripheral role under Zidane.
