Bella Varelis was brutally dumped by Locky Gilbert in The Bachelor grand finale on Thursday.

And after a packed day of doing the press rounds and discussing her heartbreak, the brunette beauty, 25, discovered she was issued with a parking fine on Friday.

An inspector placed the ticket to the windshield wiper of her Mini Cooper, parked near her Sydney home.

Some time later, the reality TV beauty stepped out to find the receipt on her car window, and looked annoyed as she removed the ticket. 

She was dressed in a laid back outfit comprised of a black hoodie with the phrase 'we are all mutual friends' emblazoned across the chest.

The stunner paired her jumper with a denim mini skirt that showed off her trim pins, and completed her look with black slides.

Earlier in the day, Bella hinted she could be Australia's next Bachelorette after getting her heart broken during The Bachelor finale. 

Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, the Bachelor runner-up confessed she'd love to be cast on the reality show.

'Yeah, I mean, what a way to get your happily ever after!' she said.

Australia's next Bachelorette? It comes after Bella exclusively to Daily Mail Australia on Friday that she'd love to be cast on the reality show. She said: 'Yeah, I mean, what a way to get your happily ever after!'

Bella was left shell-shocked during Thursday's Bachelor finale when Locky, 31, told both her and love rival Irena Srbinovska he loved them - only to dump her. 

He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.

'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'

Instead, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with nurse Irena Srbinovska.

He told her: 'When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.'

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'

Happy ending! In the end, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with Irena (left)
