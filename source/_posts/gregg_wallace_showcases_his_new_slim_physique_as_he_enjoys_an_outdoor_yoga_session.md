Gregg kept things casual for his workout, donning a pair of grey shorts and a black Adidas t-shirt.

He was also joined by an instructor from yogaxtend for the session and announced to his followers that yoga will be coming soon to his fitness website showme.fit.

Gregg has been encouraging his fans to transform their lifestyles in recent weeks and sharing the impressive results of his own weight loss. 

On Monday Gregg posted a shirtless snap of himself flaunting his now toned chest which he has previously referred too as his 'almost six pack'.

It comes after he admitted he believes losing weight is the best way to keeping sparks flying with his wife Anna, who is 21 years his junior. 

The TV personality recently revealed that he transformed his lifestyle as he wants his wife, 33, to be 'physically attracted' to him after he became disillusioned with the idea of being the 'older and fatter' partner.

Gregg used to weigh 16 stone before embarking on a new exercise and healthy eating regime that allowed him to drop a whopping four stone.  

He revealed to The Mirror: 'I’ve got more energy and stamina and I’m stronger and leaner than I was at 25.'

Gregg also said he received a big wake up call when he was informed he had dangerously high cholesterol. 

He enrolled the help of a personal trainer and now exercises for an hour, five days a week from his Kent farmhouse, as gyms remain closed. 

The TV presenter has also been getting his family on board as they have been enjoying walks around his local area. 

Gregg has also been perfecting his healthy recipes for his wife, their one-year-old son, Sid, and his daughter from a previous relationship called Libby, 23. 

His fitness journey inspired him to launch his own website showme.fit which helps others achieve a healthier lifestyle.

On the platform, Gregg shares tips from his own personal fitness journey alongside exercise routines with his personal trainer. 

His wife Anna provides extra healthy recipe ideas and there is additional nutritional and psychological advice to help users overcome their fitness challenges.

Since adopting his new lifestyle, Gregg revealed that he practices everything in moderation and still enjoys a pint of beer when he feels like it.

He said: 'When we slip up we tend to chuck it all in, but that’s not the way. You’re ­going to slip up. You’re going to go to the pub, drink too much and get a kebab on the way home.  

'There is no way I’m going through the week without a pint of beer. But I’m careful most of the time and here I am, as fit as a butcher’s dog.'
