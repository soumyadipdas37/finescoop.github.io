Sadie teamed her look with a pair of high-waisted satin trousers and a cropped sparkly jacket. 

Adding some glamorous accessories, the star opted for a Chanel quilted handbag and stylish black heels.

Sadie styled her signature raven locks into a sleek sweptback hairdo and added a slick of radiant make-up.

Meanwhile business man boyfriend Darren, 53, opted for a blue tailored trouser suit with a white unbuttoned shirt which he left untucked. He finished the look with white brogue shoes and a silver chain necklace.

Chiltern Firehouse proved its celebrity hot spot status as Lady Mary Charteris, Brooklyn Beckham's ex Hana Cross and Kimberley Garner were also spotted at the 5-star hotel. 

Sadie's appearance comes after she recently admitted that she may never live under the same roof as her millionaire boyfriend.

The star explained that she enjoys her independence while Darren continues to live two miles away from her home in North London.

The mother-of-four – who split with Jude Law in 2003 – told The Mail on Sunday: 'I like being on my own and I like my own space.

'Some people who are in their 50s are settled down with a partner. I don't live with my partner. I have got more time on my own by being at home. I think I have got a little better as I'm not so co-dependent.

'I used to be not able to do anything on my own and I do like sharing my life with somebody.

'But with my partner now, yes, we love each other and we are strong personalities, but I am not sure if we could live together.' 

Sadie said she and Darren – founder of communications agency Excell Group – still share much of their life together.

'I love having him as a companion and we like sharing experiences,' she said. 'But I have had a lot of relationships and I have had relationships with strong men, who were like my dad.'
