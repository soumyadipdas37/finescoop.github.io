Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge revealed that Thiago Alcantara burst into tears and hugged him when his move to Liverpool was confirmed.

The Spanish midfielder completed a £25million move to the Premier League champions earlier this week after seven successful years for the Bundesliga giants.

Thiago was desperate to leave Bayern this summer with a Premier League on his wishlist and Rummenigge revealed he had an emotional embrace with the player when his move was arranged.

Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said Thiago cried when he moved to Liverpool

The Bayern chief said: 'After the transfer was finalised, I saw Thiago in the parking spot waiting for me. 

'He hugged me for five minutes, cried and thanked me for making it possible for him.'

Thiago left Bayern Munich as a Champions League winner after he helped the German giants complete a sensational treble under head coach Hansi Flick. 

The 29-year-old has also won the last seven Bundesliga titles with Bayern while he has also lifted four German Cups and the 2013 Club World Cup trophy. 

After completing his move, Thiago told the Liverpool official website: 'I think it’s an amazing feeling. I was waiting for this moment for a long time and I am very, very happy to be here. 

Thiago won the treble with Bayern Munich last season which included the Champions League

'When the years are passing, you are trying to win as much as you can – and when you win, you want to win more. I think this club describes what I am as well; I want to achieve all of the goals, win as many trophies as possible.

'It also [has] this kind of family [feeling] that I need because we [like to] have a very close relationship with the club and I think I will feel this, I will have this feeling, with this club as well.'

Thiago played 235 times for Bayern Munich, scoring 31 goals in his seven years at the Allianz Arena. 

Before moving to Bayern, Thiago came through the ranks at Barcelona where he won two La Liga titles and the 2011 Champions League title.
