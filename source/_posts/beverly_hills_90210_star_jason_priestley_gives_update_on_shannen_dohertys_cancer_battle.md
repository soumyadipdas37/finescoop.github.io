Shannen, who played Brenda Walsh on Beverly Hills, 90210, revealed she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in February, three years after going into remission.

Speaking with ABC's Good Morning America at the time, she said: 'It's going to come out in a matter of days or a week that I'm stage four, so my cancer came back, and that's why I'm here.

'I don't think I've processed it. It's a bitter pill to swallow in a lot of ways.'

Back in March, the American actress slammed those who were not social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic while saying that her underlying health battle was 'hard enough'.

Jason said: 'Shannen is a real tough girl. Shannen's a fighter, and she's always been a fighter, and I know she'll continue to fight as hard as she can'

However, Shannen has regularly credited her friends, exercise and healthy eating for pushing her through her debilitating cancer battle.

Meanwhile, Jason, who is currently starring in the comedy-drama Private Eyes, spoke gushingly about her daughter Ava, who recently turned 13.

'Listen Ava's a really good kid. The one thing that has changed with her [since becoming a teenager] is that she's a little bit more distance. She tries to hide in her room and get away from us a bit more.

'It's heart-breaking. She's my little girl! I'm used to her always wanting to hug me.'

When asked if he thought the mothers of Ava's friends had posters of him growing up, Jason explained it was actually her teachers who used to have a crush on him.

'That part has been sobering, to say the least,' Jason explained.

Jason played the role of teenage heartthrob Brandon Walsh from 1990-2000.
