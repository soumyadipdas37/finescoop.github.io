Anti-lockdown protesters are now using encrypted messaging for their 'freedom day' rallies in Melbourne. 

Hundreds of anti-lockdown protesters headed to the streets over the past two weekends in Melbourne calling for an end to the strict Stage Four lockdown. 

The encrypted messages are being used to plan the 'flash protests' and to attempt to prevent police from finding out the location of the planned rally.

'If you're keen on big numbers, Saturday is the one for you,' the encrypted poster said in a group chat, according to the Herald Sun. 

'We're also bringing you Sunday Surprise 2.0 – which will be like nothing you've ever seen in Victoria before.

'It'll be peaceful, in the middle ring of Melbourne, and a lower risk from a fines perspective.' 

At the bottom of the poster in red it reads, 'This eveny will NEVER be cancelled'. 

The publication reports more than 600 people have joined the group chat, indicating their interest in the rally.  

Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Rick Nugent confirmed that officers will be ready for the protests.
