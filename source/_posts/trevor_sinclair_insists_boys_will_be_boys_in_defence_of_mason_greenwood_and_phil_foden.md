Trevor Sinclair has leapt to the defence of Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden after the pair broke quarantine rules in Iceland by bringing girls back to the team hotel.

Greenwood, 18, and Foden, 20, have been kicked out of the England squad by manager Gareth Southgate just two days after making their senior debuts and will return home instead of travelling with the rest of the squad to Denmark for Tuesday's Nations League clash. 

But while former England international Sinclair did say the young pair must 'learn and be better', the 47-year-old started his tweet on Monday by insisting 'boys will be boys.'

Sinclair tweeted on Monday afternoon: 'Boys will be boys. Let's not destroy our own young players. Learn and be better, end of x.'

The pair made their senior international debuts in the win over Iceland on Saturday - but those accomplishments have now been overshadowed. 

Players have been given strict guidelines to ensure Covid safety and the images - published by Icelandic outlet DV - appears to show Foden and Greenwood disregard those protocols on Sunday.

Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood have broken Iceland's Covid-19 restrictions after inviting girls back to their quarantine hotel in Iceland.

After a spike in local transmissions, the government recently clamped down and brought in further restrictions.

Although the England team are exempt, foreign travellers arriving in the country are being forced to quarantine for 14 days before they are allowed to travel freely in the country.

The pair's conduct in bringing girls back has also contravened the FA's behavioural rules for players whilst on international duty. 

In the short clip, Foden and Greenwood appear to be wearing their new England training wear and the players are now in hot water with management.

In an interview with DV, one of the girls in the Snapchat video allegedly filmed in the hotel room said: 'We had no idea about these [Covid-19] rules, they never said we could not take pictures.'

DV claims that the girls were booked into separate rooms in the same hotel for the players to visit them. 

Another girl claimed to have notified the England stars that the pictures were in circulation with a Snapchat message, but 'they have not opened it'.

She also claimed to have been in a relationship 'with one of the boys for a few days', noting: 'The only thing I can say is that I had been talking to one of them for a few days. I'm not going to say where.'

Man City's Foden has a two-year-old son and a long-term girlfriend, while United star Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend back in May.

England manager Gareth Southgate said at a press conference on Monday: 'Obviously they have been naive, we have dealt with it appropriately. I recognise their age but the whole world is dealing with this pandemic.

'I'm a father with children, young adults, I know people get things wrong. I'm not excusing that in this instance.

'These are two boys I don't know particularly well at the moment so can't speak in great depth. I have got to try and speak with them later in the appropriate way. They have got responsibilities and they have apologised.'
