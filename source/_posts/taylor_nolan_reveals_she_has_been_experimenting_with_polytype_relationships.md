She famously pursued Nick Viall on The Bachelor, followed by an engagement with fan favorite Derek Peth.

But now Bachelor vet Taylor Nolan is experimenting with 'poly-type relationships'.  



'It's been a really interesting last kind of two and a half-ish years of experimenting, of exploring kind of what kind of a relationship I want to be in,' Taylor told host Chris Harrison on Monday night's episode of The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons - Ever!

'I've definitely kind of experimented more': Bachelor vet Taylor Nolan is experimenting with 'poly-type relationships'

For Taylor, who describes herself as 'pretty single and safely mingling', love doesn't always come in a neat little box.    

'I've definitely kind of experimented more with poly-type relationships,' she continued. 'And love doesn't have to present itself in this fairy tale, heterosexual, non-monogamous dynamic. Like, it can look many different ways… If you're hot, you're hot.' 

'Trans people are hot, non-binary people are hot, men are hot, women are hot. Like, it's a full spectrum of attractiveness,' she continued.  

Taylor elaborated on her newfound experimentation following her appearance on Instagram, where she posted a beaming selfie.

'I'm still always learning': Taylor elaborated on her newfound experimentation following her appearance on Instagram, where she posted a beaming selfie

In the caption, Taylor revealed she was still learning to more open with her sexuality.  

'I'm still always learning,' she wrote. 'Learning and figuring out what it is to be in and create a relationship that is monogamous or consensually non-monogamous or monogamish. 

'Learning to be embracing and accepting of experiencing sexual attraction to people when I think they're hot, and not just limiting attraction based on gender (but yes I do still love me a good beard lol). Learning to be a constant student of life, where I'll be wrong and I'll be right and I'll struggle and I'll grow....cause that's what it's all about, isn't it?⁣'
