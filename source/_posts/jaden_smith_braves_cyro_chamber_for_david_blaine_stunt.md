David Blaine prepared for his latest daring stunt by testing his limits inside a cyro chamber with Jaden Smith.

David floated more than 24,000 feet above Arizona holding a cluster of balloons, and in order to prepare for the frigid temperatures overhead, the illusionist trained inside a cyro chamber.

Jaden, 22, was game to try out the chamber, telling David: 'I will try and stay in there for as long as I possibly can.'

That's cool! David Blaine prepared for his latest daring stunt by testing his limits inside a cyro chamber with Jaden Smith

Impressively, Jaden last three full minutes inside.

'The way this helps my next stunt is when I'm going up in the balloons, riding all the way up, basically every thousand feet you lose three and a half degrees,' David explained. 'On my first jump that I did from 25,000 feet, I had a full face mask on, and the first breath that I took, the whole thing iced over. So my skydiving, I was jumping down, I had to like look through this little hole.'

'Ice! While you're out of the plane!' Jaden said incredulously.

'It becomes ice immediately,' David said.

'That's crazy,' Jaden remarked.

The breakdown: Blaine explained how the cyro chamber will prepare him for the balloon stunt 

'He's doing great!' Throughout the session, David would periodically check in on Jaden, who would flash the thumbs up 

The pair took their temperatures prior to entering the chamber, with David measuring at 97.7 and Jaden at 98.3.

'We had one professional boxer yesterday tap out,' the employee said.

'Wow,' Jaden remarked. Now he was wearing a white robe and gloves.

'He got knocked out in one round!' David said.

Cool as a cucumber: Jaden stood calmly by the transparent door throughout his session 

Nice! Smith emerged from the cyro after an impressive three minutes 

'Wow, this is crazy right now!' Jaden replied.

Jaden then walked inside the chamber, where he stood calmly by the transparent door.

Throughout the session, David would periodically check in on Jaden, who would flash the thumbs up.

'He's got 45 seconds left, he's doing great,' David mused. 'He's starting to shake,' he noticed.

Brrr! Jaden shivered as he walked outside of the freezing cold temperatures

He's got this! Blaine smiled from ear-to-ear inside the cyro 

Whoa! Remarkably, David lasted in the chamber for nine minutes

Once his session was over, a shivering Jaden emerged from the chamber.

Next, it was David's turn to enter the chamber.

'In the stunt, I do have to learn when I'm going up to these heights how to stay completely coherent and hypoxia kicks in much quicker when you're in an extreme condition,' David explained.

Remarkably, David lasted in the chamber for nine minutes.

How low can you go? His temperature was so low the thermometer could not register it

Taking part: Will Smith, Jaden, Jason Sudeikis, and Olivia Wilde were among the stars taught the breathing techniques

Magical: Both Olivia and Jason were able to hold their breath for longer than four minutes, exceeding Houdini's record of three minutes and thirty seconds

'I do not know how! That was insane!' Jaden said.

'Let's see if the temperature dropped,' David mused as he approached the thermometer.

His temperature was so low the thermometer could not register it.

David prepared for his stunt by teaching several celebrities techniques that would allow them to hold their breath significantly longer than thought possible.

Will Smith, Jaden, Jason Sudeikis, and Olivia Wilde were among the stars taught the breathing techniques. 

Both Olivia and Jason were able to hold their breath for longer than four minutes, exceeding Harry Houdini's record of three minutes and thirty seconds.

'Once we got past Houdini's, I was like, "well,"' Olivia joked, to the amusement of her partner Jason.

'We got past the Navy Seals... I'm happy with this!' Olivia continued.

David successfully completed the stunt on Tuesday morning over Page, Arizona, where he floated more than 24,000 feet in the air holding onto 52 helium-filled balloons for about an hour.
