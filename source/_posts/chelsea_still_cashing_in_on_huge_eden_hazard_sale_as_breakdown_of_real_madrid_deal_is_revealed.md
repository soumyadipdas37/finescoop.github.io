Chelsea are still reaping the rich rewards of the enormous deal to sell Real Madrid Eden Hazard last summer. 

The breakdown of the agreement negotiated by renowned hard-nosed director  Marina Granovskaia has been revealed. 

The Blues will end up banking £143million in total having been paid £36m up front last year, according to Voetball. 

Eden Hazard was sold to Real Madrid by Chelsea last summer and the Blues are cashing in 

Director Marina Granovskaia has been praised for striking the deal with Real Madrid for Hazard

This time around Real will pay Chelsea £50m and next year will see the coffers boosted even further to the tune of £57m. 

The deal is all the more remarkable when Hazard was already pushing to leave the club and had just one year left on his contract at the time. 

It was perhaps even sweeter when it appeared Chelsea had the better of the bargain with Hazard struggling in his first campaign with the LaLiga giants. 

Hazard was plagued by form and fitness issues throughout the season for Real 

Form and fitness issues plagued him and the Belgian even described the season as his worst ever. 

Hazard scored just once in 22 outings for Real with hamstring, foot and ankle injuries a constant problem. 

The financial outlay to bring him in is providing a boost in the market for Chelsea, who have broken the record for the biggest ever Premier League summer spend. 

Kai Havertz will follow Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell through the door at Stamford Bridge, four players recruited at a combined fee of around £230m.   

This summer Real Madrid are paying Frank Lampard's side £50m and next year it will be £57m
