Detectives have been left stumped after a teenager was mysteriously found dead with blood on her face in bed in Western Australia. 

Brooke Tuhakaraina's body was discovered by a friend in the home she shared with workmates in Port Denison, north of Perth, at about 7am on Wednesday morning.

Homicide detectives and forensics are investigating and awaiting the results of an autopsy.

As of early Thursday morning, there was no explanation for the 19-year-old's sudden death.

Devastated Dongra shearing contractor Mike Henderson said the teenager was found by a member of his staff in the home he lets to them. 

'She was a wool handler, a nice kid,' he told The West Australian through tears. 

'She was only 19 and she worked for me for a couple of months.' 

Ms Tuhakaraina is originally from New Zealand and had been working in Western Australia for the past year.

Her family posted 'we are all devastated at this time,' on Facebook on Wednesday.

Police set up a crime scene, with neighbours saying the people who lived in the share house were constantly 'coming and going'.

The small cray fishing town in WA's mid-west has been rocked by tragedy before.

Heather Glendinning murdered her daughters Jane, 12 and Jess, 10, before killing herself in the family home on December 5, 2011.  

The girls' father repeatedly warned of his ex-wife's deteriorating mental health.

'Their mother was not sane and fit to have custody of them - and no one wanted to hear that until it was too late,' he said in 2019.

At an inquest into the deaths in 2016, Coroner Barry King determined the tragedy was potentially avoidable.

He said the outcome could have been different if Glendinning's declining mental state had been discussed between the Family Court, mental health authorities and government agencies.
