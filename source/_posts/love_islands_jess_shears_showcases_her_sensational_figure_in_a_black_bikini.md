They're one of the biggest Love Island success stories, having met on the dating  show in 2017 and going on to get married and have a baby. 

And Jess Shears, 27, displayed her eye-popping curves as she went paddleboarding with her husband, Dom Lever, 26, in Bournemouth on Wednesday.  

The reality TV couple appeared united as they made the most of their fun-filled date and enjoyed a momentary break from their baby boy, 12 months.

Dom shared the picture of he and his wife emerging from the turquoise water on the British coast. 

Jess' toned midriff and ample cleavage were on full display in her black bikini. 

She wore a pair of rounded shades to protect her eyes from the glorious September sun, and styled her chocolate tresses in an effortless ponytail. 

Dom displayed his six-pack in black swimming trunks as he trailed the paddleboard out of the water.

He commented on the picture: 'Evening paddleboards with the Mrs @fatstickboards'.  

The pair fell head over heels for each other on Love Island in 2017 and became the first contestants to have sex in the secret hideaway. 

Jess and Dom announced their engagement after three months of dating and married in a romantic ceremony on the Greek Island of Mykonos in October 2018. 

They revealed that they were expecting their first child in May 2019, seven months after tying the knot, and welcomed their baby boy into the world in September that year.

 Jess recently hit back at speculation that she is pregnant for a second time after setting tongues wagging with a suggestive Instagram caption.

The Love Island star made a social media post in April saying she 'predicts a baby boom' in nine months, but clarified she wasn't referring to herself.

Jess then showed off her toned stomach in a sports bra as she posed for a snap, telling her followers: 'Just thought I'd come on her my last post everyone think I've take offence or asking for people to think I'm pregnant because of my caption.  

'I'm not pregnant and I didn't expect people to think anything other than i think there's going to be a baby bump.

'I think people are stuck at home not going out what else are they supposed to be doing. No hard feelings not pregnant but I think a lot of people probably will be.'
