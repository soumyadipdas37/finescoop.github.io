The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge saw lockdown as  'a rare gift' because royal children are usually 'unavoidably denied the privilege of prolonged time with their parents', a royal expert has claimed.

Prince William, 38, and Kate Middleton, 38, spent the majority of the last six months at their Norfolk home of Anmer Hall with their children, Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five, and Prince Louis, two.

Now royal commentator Victoria Arbiter has claimed the period gave the Cambridge children a 'privilege generations of royal youngsters have unavoidably been denied — prolonged time at home with just Mum and Dad'.

Writing for Australian site 9Honey, she said the children would likely be 'the most well-adjusted generation the royals have ever known', adding: 'For George, Charlotte and Louis a lifetime of duty eventually awaits, but thanks to the relative normality their childhood affords, their royal calling will feel less like a prison sentence and more one to be proud of.'

The royal commentator said the couple have 'set a royal parenting precedent' with their techniques.     

Victoria wrote that Prince William has long 'strived' to provide his children with the 'stability he once craved'.

Meanwhile, she added that Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton have 'remained at the heart of the Cambridges' existence' and offer a 'stabilising force' to the family unit.   

She wrote: 'Given his admiration for their solid middle-class values and hands-on style, it's hardly surprising Carole and Mike play such a significant role in their grandchildren's upbringing.'

Royal commentator Victoria Arbiter said the children would likely be 'the most well-adjusted generation the royals have ever known' thanks to Prince William and Kate's parenting techniques 

She commented that the combination of Kate's focus on early years education and the Middleton's 'nurturing presence', alongside Prince William's focus on mental well being and the Windsor traditions, would lead the Cambridge children 'to be the most well-adjusted generation the royals have ever known.'

Meanwhile Victoria added that Prince William and Kate are 'paving the way' for 'royal children of tomorrow' with their parenting techniques.     

Her comments come after the couple returned to London following months away as the children prepare for the start of their new school year.  

Last month, the Queen reportedly reunited with William, Kate and their three children for the first time since the country was plunged in coronavirus lockdown.

Victoria said that lockdown had brought the Cambridge children a 'privilege generations of royal youngsters have unavoidably been denied — prolonged time at home with just Mum and Dad' (pictured, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis at Anmer Hall in April) 

Almost exactly five months after the Queen told Britons 'We will meet again' in a now historic address to the nation, she had her first socially distanced meeting with all five of the Cambridges.

It was the first face-to-face meeting involving the Duke and Duchess, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis since lockdown began in March, reports The Sun.

William and Kate and the three children are said to have visited Balmoral, in Scotland, where the Queen and Prince Philip have been in a Covid- secure 'bubble' since the beginning of August.

According to the Sun, sources say the Queen spent time with her great-grandchildren while outside on the royal estate.

Prince Edward, Sophie of Wessex and Princess Anne were also reportedly at the 50,000-acre estate at the end of August. 

The source told The Sun: 'Like every family, they've been desperate to get back together and over the moon it was possible this weekend.

'They've all been up there for a few days and although there are very strict procedures with social distancing, they've been able to find ways of seeing each other outside.

'It's obviously been a difficult year for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh seeing the country dealing with the pandemic, so they were all keen to go there to show their support.' 

Earlier this summer, Prince William revealed his patience has been tested while homeschooling his children in lockdown, and that he's been struggling to teach Year 2 maths.

Prince George is in his final year of infant school at Thomas's Battersea, in south west London.

His little sister Princess Charlotte joined him in September and is currently in the reception class. 

But the royal children have been homeschooled since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, which Prince William admits has been a struggle.  

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Lives That Peter Crouch Podcast, which was recorded partially via Zoom and partially at Kensington Palace in March, the heir said: 'I've found it pretty testing, not going to lie, trying to keep the children engaged in some kind of work, it's been an interesting few months.

'I've learned through homeschooling that my patience is a lot shorter than I thought it was, that's probably been the biggest eye opener for me, and that my wife has super patience,' the duke revealed.
