On 21 July 2020, Daily Mail Australia published an article about George Alex and Caitlan Hall entitled “Drug kingpin Michael Ibrahim's makeup artist wife and bankrupt construction identity George Alex are charged over their alleged involvement in major crime syndicate”. The article referred to Ms Hall as having been charged with recklessly dealing with proceeds of crime in excess of $1million. The article also contained a photograph of Margaret Staltaro, the caption to which incorrectly named her as being Caitlan Hall. Daily Mail Australia accepts that Ms Staltaro had nothing to do with the charge that Ms Hall was facing. Daily Mail Australia unreservedly apologises to Ms Staltaro for the use of her photograph in the article, and for any hurt and embarrassment that she may have suffered as a result.
