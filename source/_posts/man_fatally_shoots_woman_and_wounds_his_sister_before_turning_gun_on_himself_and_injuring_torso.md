A man fatally shot a woman and wounded his sister before turning the gun on himself and firing a round into his upper torso region in what Fort Worth police believe is an attempted murder-suicide.

The shootings took place on Wednesday in the 900 block of East Davis Street on the city’s south side, according to Fort Worth police.

Investigators released few details about the shootings, including the ages of the suspect and the victims. The man’s condition is unknown.

A Fort Worth police spokesperson revealed that the suspect and the victims are all adults.

Police have also not revealed the nature of the relationships between the individuals involved, though 911 records indicate that the man with the gun had wounded his sister.

One woman was pronounced dead inside the south Fort Worth home where the shooting took place, according to the Star-Telegram.

The other female shooting victim managed to call 911. She was rushed to a hospital, and she was expected to survive.

‘At this time we’re not looking for anybody else and we want to note the general public is not - we don’t feel they’re in any danger at this point,’ Fort Worth police spokesperson Buddy Calzada said.

Investigators continue to gather clues at the scene of the shootings.

‘It’s a possible murder-suicide,’ Calzada said.

‘We don’t have those details yet until homicide confirms, and we’re waiting for the final word from homicide.’

Officers responded to the 911 call just after 6am on Wednesday. 

Police said the caller reported that her brother had shot himself in an attempted suicide.
