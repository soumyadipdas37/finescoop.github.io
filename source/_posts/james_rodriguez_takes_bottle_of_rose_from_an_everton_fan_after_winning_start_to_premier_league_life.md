He played the full 90 minutes as Everton secured an impressive 1-0 victory at Tottenham on the opening day of the Premier League season and dazzled during the comfortable follow-up win over the newly promoted Baggies.

After West Brom took a shock early lead, Rodriguez reversed the scoreline on the stroke of half-time, adding to Dominic Calvert-Lewin's equaliser with a clinical finish.
