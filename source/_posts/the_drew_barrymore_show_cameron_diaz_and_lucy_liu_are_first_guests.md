Drew Barrymore will be welcoming friends and co-stars from some of the biggest hits of her illustrious film career when her new daytime talk show premieres next week.    

On Tuesday, The Drew Barrymore Show announced a star-studded slate of guests expected for the premiere week, which will kick things off next Monday with a Charlie's Angels reunion featuring Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, almost 20 years since the first film hit theaters.

Also on Monday, Barrymore, 45, will welcome her three-time onscreen love interest Adam Sandler, with whom she first starred in 1998's beloved period rom-com The Wedding Singer.

It will be a special treat in particular to see Diaz, 48, in front of the camera, albeit as herself – the actress has stepped away from performing ever since 2014's Annie.

Cameron, Lucy and Drew appeared in 2000's Charlie's Angels, which was a worldwide hit that spawned a sequel in 2003 – Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, featuring Demi Moore.  

Sandler, 53, re-teamed with Barrymore in the cute 50 First Dates in 2004, and then ten years later for the less successful Blended.

It will of course be nice to see Drew catching up with her former co-stars, whom she reportedly still counts among her friends.

Other guest lined up for the rest of the premiere week for the one-hour nationally syndicated program include Gabrielle Union, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Eichner, Jane Fonda, Charlize Theron and Billy Porter.  

Barrymore's multi-format show will incorporate news-like segments in addition to standard chat show elements, all focused around Drew's infectious brand of optimism.

It remains to be seen how exactly the star – who made her film debut at age five in 1980's Altered States – will actually welcome her guests, as concerns around the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic remain prevalent.

While the show is being shot and produced in New York City, other review shows there have continued to 'welcome' guests virtually via Zoom-like platforms.

While in-person reunions remain preferable – HBO Max's long-touted Friends reunion has again been delayed until next spring in hopes they can all sit on the same couch – it's very likely Drew will be surrounded by a bare minimum of other people for the start of this new endeavor.

Nonetheless, reuniting with her Angels will be a surefire way to start off the proceedings, as Drew, Cameron and Lucy had a phenomenal mix of chemistry and humor in their two Charlie's Angels action flicks. 

The first Charlie's Angels premiered in theaters on November 3rd, 2000, which makes next week's reunion a 20th anniversary celebration almost to the date. 

Last year, the franchise tried to capture that previous magic with a reboot starring Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska, but the film failed to make much of an impression with audiences.
