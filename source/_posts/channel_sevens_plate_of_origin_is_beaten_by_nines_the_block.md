Another agreed: 'The format of #PlateOfOriginAU is essentially My Kitchen Rules but two teams at once'.

However, some liked the mash up of formats, with one fan Tweeting: 'I like this so far seems like a cross between Masterchef and My Kitchen Rules'.

Another added: '#PlateOfOrigin seems cool so far. But it's kinda hard too shorten the title #MKR style.'
