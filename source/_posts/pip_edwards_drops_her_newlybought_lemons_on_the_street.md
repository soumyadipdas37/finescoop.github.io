She may appear cool, calm and collectd on her glossy Instagram page. 

But Pip Edwards, 40, was spotted during a rather chaotic moment on Monday as she dropped a bag of newly-purchased lemons on the street outside P.E. Nation activewear headquarters in Alexandria, Sydney. 

The new girlfriend of cricketer Michael Clarke certianly had her hands full as she emerged from a parked car with a grocery shopping bag in one hand and a $2300 Burberry tote slung around her shoulders.  

When things turned sour: Pip Edwards, 40, was spotted during a rather chaotic moment on Monday as she dropped a bag of newly-purchased lemons on the street outside P.E. Nation activewear headquarters in Alexandria, Sydney

As she teetered on the sidewalk, the mother-of-one momentarily lost control of the grocery bag and allowed several lemons to spill forth and land squarely in a gutter,  

As Pip scrambled to pick up the fruit, a packaged salad threatened to fall out of the bag as well.  

Luckily, the agile activewear guru clutched the box of greens with her spare hand, preventing the package from hitting the pavement as well.

Following the unfortunate calamity, Pip was spotted making her way into the building with a lemon in one hand and the salad in the other. 

Despite her faux pas, Pip managed to look typically trendy during the brief sighting. 

The blonde sported a stylish white singlet emblazoned with the P.E. Nation logo, black leggings and a pink jumper tied around her waist.

She completed her look with a pair of black runners, a gold watch and several rings.  

While Pip may need to work on her grocery-balancing skills, she's currently enjoying a perfectly-matched romance with Michael Clarke.  

Following months of speculation, Pip finally confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram official' in July before enjoying a PDA-filled trip to Noosa, Queensland that same month.  

Michael had separated from Kyly, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.

The Clarkes have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their daughter Kelsey Lee.
