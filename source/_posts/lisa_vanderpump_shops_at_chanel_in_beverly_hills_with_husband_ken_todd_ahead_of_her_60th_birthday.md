She'll celebrate a milestone birthday on Tuesday.

And on Monday, Lisa Vanderpump marked the last day of her 50s with a little shopping at the Chanel boutique in Beverly Hills.

The reality TV star and restaurateur was accompanied by her devoted husband Ken Todd and two of their beloved dogs.

Milestone birthday: She'll turn 60 on Tuesday. And Lisa Vanderpump marked the last day of her 50s with trip to the Chanel boutique in Beverly Hills with hubby Ken Todd and two of their dogs

The couple, who celebrated their 38th wedding anniversary last month, walked arm in arm as Lisa carried her purchases in a large store bag.

She turns 60 on Tuesday and no doubt Ken has plans to spoil her on her special day depsite the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.

The pair abided by the rules and wore face masks on their outing, with Ken pausing at one point to place a sweet kiss on his famous wife's cheek through his face covering.

Lisa was dressed in a dark pinstripe blazer and blue jeans along with towering black peep toe heels with platform soles.

Lisa and Ken tied the knot in 1982 just a few months after meeting.

On August 28, she shared a snap showing herself and Ken enjoying a meal at a swanky hotel.

Alongside it, she tweeted: 'Agh we made it...just, most said we never would.' 

The couple have two children - daughter Pandora, 34, who is in charge of all things Vanderpump Wines alongside her parents, and son Max, 28, who works as a busser in their restaurant SUR which serves as the main backdrop for the show Vanderpump Rules. 

This summer it was announced the former star of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills would be securing another spinoff, this time a show about her posh dog rescue store, Vanderpump Dogs. 

The show will be coming to NBC's new streaming service Peacock at some point in the future.
