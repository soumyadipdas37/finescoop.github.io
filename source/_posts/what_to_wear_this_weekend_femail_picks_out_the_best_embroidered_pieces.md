Camilla Ridley-Day shared advice for embracing the embroidery trend. She wears a top from Anthropologie with an easy to wear floral thread design 

TIMELESS DESIGN

Pre-Covid, high priestess of fashion Anna Wintour decreed leather trench coats and embroidery to be key looks for 2020.

Personally, I’ll ditch the leather coat. Glamorous as it may be, my husband’s reaction to it would be more than just an eye roll.

Embroidery, however, is a trend I have loved ever since British designer Bruce Oldfield gifted me a hand-stitched veil for my wedding more than a decade ago. It’s timeless.

I’ve since loaned the veil to my sister and a close friend. One day, maybe my daughters will want to use it too.

MASTERFULLY CRAFTED

The work that goes into embroidery is intricate and skilled, which is why New York-based Ulla Johnson and Etro showed off pieces like this on the catwalk.

While High-Street versions are made by machine to cut costs, the pretty result can be just as treasured.

PERFECT PICK-ME-UP

The end of summer is calling, so invest in styles that will transition into autumn with ease.

I’ve teamed this easy-to-wear top by Anthropologie with smart trousers — perfect for going back to the office.

Or wear it with jeans if you’re still on Zoom calls.

KEEP STYLING SIMPLE

Go for an all-over embroidered piece if you want to make a statement, like the jacket from Monsoon, or there’s plenty out there with just a hint of stitching — the top from River Island has a more subtle approach.

Embroidery follows the same fashion rule as wearing a print: the rest of your look is best kept simple.

The skirt from Boden will look great with a white shirt or a rollneck and tights when it gets colder, but the colourful threads mean you will add cheer to your style in the depths of winter.
