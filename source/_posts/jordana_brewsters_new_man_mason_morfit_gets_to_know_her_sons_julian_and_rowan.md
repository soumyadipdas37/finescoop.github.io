After becoming Instagram official on September 5th, Jordana Brewster and her new man Mason Morfit have been inseparable. 

And on Friday the Fast & Furious actress, 40, and Morfit were seen starting off their day grabbing coffee from go-to spot Caffe Luxxe at the Brentwood Country Mart before linking up later to take Jordana's sons out.  

For their morning jaunt the two looked put together as they stepped out holding hands. 

Look of love: Jordana Brewster, 40, and her new boyfriend CEO Mason Morfit grabbed coffee in Brentwood before the loved up pair took Jordana's kids to school as she introduced him to her sons 

Jordana had on cuffed blue jeans and a striped red t-shirt which she paired under a black leather jacket. 

She threw on a pair of nude and black ballet flats, a checkered yellow face mask and some beige framed sunglasses as she looked back to grab her boyfriend's hand. 

The two have been spotted out on multiple occasions laying the PDA on very thick no matter where they are. 

Attached at the hip: Just last week Jordana and Mason were seen putting on an intense kissing display while sitting outside of the same coffee shop 

Coffee date: The pair have been linked since July after Jordana filed for divorce from her ex-husband producer Andrew Form with whom she shares her two sons 

Mason walked lovingly behind his girlfriend as he wore black jeans and a checkered button down, throwing on a brown belt and a pair of sneakers for their morning caffeine fix. 

Like his brunette bombshell, he too wore a face mask to comply with CDC guidelines as they grabbed their coffee and bounced. 

Jordana who is a doting mom to Julian, six, and Rowan, four, made sure to bring her new man along as the couple were later seen on a family excursion.  

The couple were spotted making out in front of the boys as her children played on mechanical rides. 

Kid approved: Mason was seen grasping Julian's hand as Jordana walked behind with Rowan while the new family unit brought her children to school 

Morfit could not get his hands off his leading lady as he copped a feel of her behind. 

The loved-up pair though in parenting mode were not shy about continuing their passionate infatuation.  

Despite the mushy behavior, it seems as if Mason was a hit with her sons, even engaging with them on the rides as the boys screamed for attention.  

At one point the ValueAct CEO was seen grasping Julian's hand while Jordana walked behind with Rowan as the family unit strolled in Brentwood. 

Family ties: No doubt things are getting serious between the two as the actress seemed to feel incredibly confident bringing her new beau around her youngins

 No doubt things are getting serious between the two as the actress seemed to feel incredibly confident bringing her new beau around her boys. 

The couple have moved increasingly fast in their relationship as Jordana only filed for divorce from A Quiet Place producer, Andrew, in July after 13 years of marriage. 

Days later she was spotted putting on an affectionate display with Mason at the beach. 

The San Francisco based hedge fund CEO was married in 2004 to his ex though details of when or how the pair split are not known.

Jordana is currently gearing up for the release of F9 - the ninth installation of Fast & Furious starring Vin Diesel. The film is set for release in April 2021.
