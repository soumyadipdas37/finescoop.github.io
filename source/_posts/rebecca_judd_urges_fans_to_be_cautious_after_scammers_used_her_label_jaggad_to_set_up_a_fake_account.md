Rebecca Judd has warned her fans to be careful after scammers used her activewear label Jaggad to set up a fake social media account.

On Tuesday, the WAG, 37, shared a post to Instagram stories, urging her followers to not pass on their personal details to the fake account. 

'We are aware there is an impersonation account contacting the JAGGAD community at the moment. Do NOT pass on any personal details,' she wrote.

She continued: 'Report this account direct to Instagram. We are working to have this account removed immediately.'

The scammer was contacting Jaggad members, and telling them that they'd won a competition and needed to provide their PayPal details to claim their prize.

Meanwhile, Rebecca co-founded Jaggad in 2013 with retired AFL star Chris Judd and fellow ex-footy player Steven Greene and his wife, Michelle. 

In June, the JAGGAD label was forced to deny claims it had copied the designs of a rival company.

Byron Bay-based activewear brand Nagnata posted several side-by-side photos to Instagram, comparing its woven jumper designs to similar items from JAGGAD's new Ridge Knit collection.

'If this Australian brand is going to keep copying Nagnata and ignoring our emails, then we're going to start calling them out,' the caption read.

JAGGAD's Ridge Knit range features several ribbed jumpers with striped patterns and a thick block of colour around the chest.

However, none of these designs are completely identical to those made by Nagnata.

Denying Nagnata's accusations, a JAGGAD spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'JAGGAD takes assertions of intellectual property infringement very seriously.

'In this case, it is clear that JAGGAD has not infringed any other brand's intellectual property rights.'

JAGGAD also disputed Nagnata's claim that they had 'ignored' email correspondence concerning the similar designs.

The spokesperson said the Judds' company had responded to Nagnata's inquiries in writing twice in the past two months, on April 17 and May 18.
