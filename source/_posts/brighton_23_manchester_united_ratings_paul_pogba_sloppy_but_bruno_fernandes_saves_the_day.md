Manchester United beat Brighton in dramatic fashion at the Amex Stadium as Bruno Fernandes' last-gasp penalty gave the Red Devils a 3-2 win.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side went behind thanks to Neal Maupay's first-half penalty but levelled just before the break as Harry Maguire influenced a Lewis Dunk own goal. 

Marcus Rashford's brilliant solo goal gave the visitors the lead just moments after Brighton had another penalty chalked off through VAR. 

Bruno Fernandes' last-gasp penalty gave Manchester United a 3-2 away at Brighton

Graham Potter's side, who hit the woodwork five times throughout the match, thought the had finally levelled in the last minute of stoppage after Solly March's header at the back post - but the drama hadn't stopped then.

Maupay handled in the penalty area just before the referee blew for full-time but Chris Kavanagh checked VAR as the players were shaking hands and pointed to the spot. Fernandes dispatched the penalty to save Solskjaer's blushes.

Here are the post-match player ratings from the match at the Amex... 

Brighton (3-4-3):

Mat Ryan - 6

Powerless to prevent any of United's goals, distributed well throughout.

Ben White - 6

Faded in second half after a promising opening. Left for dead by Rashford’s brilliance in build up to United’s second.

Ben White (right) was left for dead as Marcus Rashford (left) put United 2-1 in front

Lewis Dunk - 6 

Commanding display, slightly hesitant on United’s equaliser which allowed Maguire to nip in.

Aaron Webster - 6

Looping header hit the crossbar in first half. Solid if slightly hesitant when bringing the ball out from the back.

Tariq Lamptey - 7

Won the first-half penalty, a real threat down the right-hand side. Faded slightly in second half but another strong performance from the teenager.

It was another bright showing from Tariq Lamptey (left) who won another first-half penalty

Adam Lallana - 7

Marshalled Pogba well, provided great energy. Replaced on 74 minutes as Brighton went in search of equaliser.

Steven Alzate - 8

Excellent on the ball, kept Brighton ticking in midfield. Unfortunate to be on the losing side.

Solly March - 7

Grabbed equaliser in stoppage time and will rightly feel aggrieved to be on losing side after promising display.

Leandro Trossard (right) hit the woodwork three times at the Amex Stadium against United

Leandro Trossard - 6

Hit the woodwork on three separate occasions, worked hard throughout. Will be cursing his luck in front of goal.

Aaron Connolly - 7

Busy and ran the channels well, never let United’s defenders settle. Replaced on 74 minutes.

Neal Maupay - 7

From hero to villian after cheeky panenka left De Gea red-faced, adjudged to have handled the ball which led to United's penalty at the death.

Substitutes:

Pascal Gross - 6 

Replaced Lallana on 74 minutes, Played a few nice passes and kept the ball well.

Alireza Jahanbakhsh - 5 

Replaced Connolly on 74 minutes, struggled to make any impact late on.

Not used: Steele, Bernardo, Burn, Veltman, Molumby

Manchester United (4-2-3-1)

David De Gea - 7

Left red-faced by Maupay’s penalty. Looked more assured than in recent weeks, made vital late stop to deny Trossard.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 6

Struggled at time defensively and sloppy in possession. Strong in the tackle though and looked threatening going forward.

Victor Lindelof - 6

Kept busy by Brighton’s industrious front three. Dealt with any aerial danger commandingly. Still questions marks over his abilities in 1v1 situations.

Harry Maguire - 6

Forced the equaliser at a time when United badly needed it. Better in possession than in recent weeks, still hesitant at times in defensive situations.

United captain Harry Maguire (right) played a big role in the equaliser then won a late penalty

Luke Shaw - 6

Tough time dealing with the lively Lamptey to begin with but better going forward and won the free kick which led to United’s equaliser.

Paul Pogba - 5

Too casual in possession at times, struggled to have any real impact on the game. Survived VAR penalty check early in second half. Replaced on 64 minutes.

Nemanja Matic - 6

Worked hard and provided Maguire with the equaliser. Too slow to release the ball at times.

Mason Greenwood - 6

One of his quieter days in front of goal, looked a threat on the counter. Replaced on 82 minutes.

Bruno Fernandes - 8

Kept his composure brilliantly to convert late penalty. Provided two other moments of quality in the build up to Maguire's equaliser and Rashford's well-taken second.

Bruno Fernandes grabbed a goal and played a big role in the other two in United's win

Marcus Rashford - 7

Took his goal excellently, seems to be growing in confidence, United will be hoping he can kick on from here.

Anthony Martial - 6

Quieter day in front of goal. A physical presence but struggled to make an impact.
