The Kardashian-Jenner family announced the end of their long-running reality series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, on Tuesday. 

Although gracious when dropping the bombshell on dedicated fans, Kim K and company did not give a specific reason for walking away from the show after 20 seasons in 2021. 

But now Kim's longtime friend and former boss is sharing her thoughts on the family's decision to pull the plug on KUWTK.

Dishing: Paris Hilton spoke out about the decision to end Keeping Up With The Kardashians

'Just with The Simple Life, I was just over it. I wanted to just focus on my business,' Hilton said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. 

'They have huge business empires. I am sure they want to spend their time doing that and being with [their] families.'

The hotel heiress revealed that she hasn't yet spoken with the family about their decision but she surmised that they probably 'have so many things going on.'

'And after 20 seasons, I think they are ready to just live their life and not be on camera every second.'

Her take: Hilton, who grew up with Kim as her friend in Los Angeles, surmised that the family are probably 'ready to just live their life and not be on camera every second,' in an interview with Entertainment Tonight; The two friends are seen together in August 2006

Hilton, 39, went on to assure fans they will still see plenty of the Kardashian-Jenners in the years to come, all while raving about their massive success since KUWTK debuted in 2007.  

'It makes me feel incredibly proud. I have known [Kim] since we were little girls, and the empires that she and her sisters and her mother have built is just amazing,' Hilton gushed. 

'I love them all so much, and it's exciting to see your friends do well.'

In an interview on Wednesday with Ryan Seacrest, who co-created the E! reality show, Kris Jenner gave a little insight into the motivation for ending KUWTK. 

'I think the number 20 used to sound good until 2020, but the number 20 just seemed like the right time I think for us to take a minute and breathe and everybody slow down a bit… figure out what our next steps are,' she explained while doing her best to hold back tears.

'We've had such an amazing run and we're so grateful for every single moment and everyone we work with.'
