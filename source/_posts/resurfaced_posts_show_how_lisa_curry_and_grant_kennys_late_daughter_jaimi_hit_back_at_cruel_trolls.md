Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny's daughter Jaimi lost her private battle with an unspecified illness on Monday at the age of 33.

Emotional tributes continue to be shared regarding her character as friends and family mourn the heartbreaking loss. 

Before her death, Jaimi was fiercely protective of her loving clan and was known to defend her famous mother against nasty trolls.

In 2014, according to New Idea, Jaimi publicly slammed false reports that her mother Lisa's desire to have more children had ulterior motives, namely revenge

Lisa, who was at the time dating much younger ex-boyfriend Joel Walkenhorst, then 31, experienced backlash for wanting to grow her family.

The nasty online comments claimed her desire to mother another child at 51 was solely to 'get back' at ex-husband Grant Kenny for fathering a daughter with radio star Fifi Box in 2013. 

Fifi kept the father of her daughter Beatrix ‘Trixie’ Belle Box private for three years, before confirming Grant as Trixie's dad in 2016. 

The pair secretly dated in 2012 but broke up just before she revealed she was pregnant with her first child.

Lisa’s late daughter Jaimi stepped up to defend her mum at the time: 'Mum wanting a child had nothing to do with Fifi... Mum had talked with us about her thoughts on going through IVF before Trixie was conceived.'

In her impassioned social media post, she continued: 'You never know the conversations we have had as a family, or the timing of these. It’s upsetting to read such nasty things being said about our mother, without people knowing her personally.'

The family appeared to share no bad blood between them, with Jaimi often babysitting her stepsister Trixie.

The Curry-Kenny family confirmed Jaimi's death in a statement on Monday afternoon.

Neither the family's statement on Monday nor Lisa's Instagram update on Tuesday specified the exact nature of Jaimi's illness.

However, it's understood Jaimi had long battled an eating disorder, with her family supporting her through years of treatment at a private clinic.

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement, which was written by Jaimi's father, Grant on Monday.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.  

Jaimi is survived by her Ironman father, former pro swimmer mother, brother Jett and sister Morgan.
