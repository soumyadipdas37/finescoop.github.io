Hugh Jackman has bared all in a hilarious new advertisement for Australian footwear brand R.M. Williams.

The Hollywood star, 51, wore nothing but a pair of short black boots as he starred in the label's new TV campaign.

In the video, Hugh is first seen sitting in an office chair and explaining why he loves the boots.

'I'm actually in love. They're great. They're amazing,' the actor said before spreading his legs open on the desk.

The brand's representative then tells Hugh: 'While we appreciate how literally you've taken the clause that stipulates you can only wear R.M. Williams.

'I want you to know that you are allowed and we highly encourage you to wear other clothes.'

Hugh appears to ignore the advice and then starts explaining why he loves wearing the boots.

'I mean look at this, it's one beautiful piece of leather, beautiful stitching and they're comfortable,' he said. 

'I mean the balls of my feet just feel like they've died.. Seriously they've changed my life,' he added.

Hugh then begins to stand up to leave the room but stops to compliment how comfortable the chair is.

'A new chair? Honestly you should sit in this,' the Wolverine star said while moving around in his seat.

'Everything at R.M. Williams is just so comfortable,' he ended.

Hugh continues: 'I mean look at this, it's one beautiful piece of leather, beautiful stitching and they're comfortable'
