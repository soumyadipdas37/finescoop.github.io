A boy racer who lost control of his new Suzuki Liana at 50mph in a 30 zone and killed a pensioner wept after he was found guilty of causing his death. 

Daniel Freeman-Hollins' car ploughed into Raymond Johnstone, 72, outside the Robin Hood pub in Castlemorton, Worcestershire in May last year.

Mr Johnstone was hit with such force he was crushed against his Land Rover Freelander which was rammed into a pub building which collapsed on top of him.   

Despite being rushed to hospital, the grandfather died of multiple injuries.

Freeman-Hollins, of Malvern, Worcestershire, was found guilty of causing death by careless driving and causing death while unlicensed and uninsured.

As the verdict was read out yesterday, the 20-year-old broke down in tears.  

Worcester Crown Court was told that the defendant had only owned the car for a week despite not having a licence or insurance.

 Freeman-Hollins was travelling at more than 50mph with his girlfriend in the car when he lost control outside the Robin Hood pub, the court heard.

He swerved to avoid Mr Johnstone's daughter-in-law Ruth Johnstone, who was pulling out of the pub car park at 7.30pm.

He then collided with a parked Kia Sportage and span across the car park and struck Mr Johnstone's Land Rover.

Quizzing Freeman-Hollins, Harpreet Sandhu, prosecuting, said: 'It is the case you simply did not have enough time to see the hazard and react to it.

The defendant lost control of his new Suzuki Liana at 50mph outside the Robin Hood pub in Castlemorton, Worcestershire in May last year

'You came round that corner not travelling at 50mph (the speed limit on that stretch of road) but at a speed over 50mph. You didn't use your breaks. That's why there were no skidmarks (on the road).'

The court heard Mr Johnstone was dragged into the building which collapsed on top of him. 

Mr Sandhu said: 'The Liana struck the Freelander, sending it into the timber building.

'As it did so Raymond Johnstone, standing next to that Freelander, was dragged into the building with the car.'

The defendant only suffered minor injuries as his car was propelled back into the middle of the road.

The jury took just one hour and ten minutes to find Freeman-Hollins unanimously guilty. The case was adjourned until November 13 for sentencing.
