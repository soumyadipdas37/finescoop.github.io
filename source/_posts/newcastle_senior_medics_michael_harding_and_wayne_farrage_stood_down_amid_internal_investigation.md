Two of Steve Bruce’s senior Newcastle United medical staff have been stood down from their roles amid an internal investigation.

First-team physio Michael Harding and soft tissue therapist Wayne Farrage have not been seen at the club for the past week.

Newcastle are not commenting on the reasons for their removal from duty but confirmed the pair had agreed not to work until the internal process had concluded. Club insiders have told Sportsmail they are not currently expected to return.

Harding — the physio who treats players on the pitch — has been at the club since 2006, while masseur Farrage joined in 2011.

The pair are popular among many of the first-team players, who are said to be shocked at their sudden absence. Harding is also a co-director at the private Osborne Clinic alongside longstanding Newcastle physio Derek Wright.

Farrage is also part of the Osborne team. He has previously worked for Watford, Charlton, West Ham, Fulham and Portsmouth.

Meanwhile, Sportsmail understands that there have been several confirmed cases of Covid-19 inside Newcastle’s academy.

This has led to a strict separation of first-team and academy players and staff. Younger players no longer being called on to train with the senior squad.
