A visibly drunk California couple was arrested at Miami International Airport on Sunday after the woman hopped over the airline ticket counter and attacked a ticket agent who refused to let her board because she wasn’t wearing shoes.

Brittney Mohammadi of Huntington Beach and her boyfriend, Manuel Arteaga, 26, of Hawaiian Gardens approached the check-in counter at the American Airlines departure hall on Sunday.

They were looking to get on board Flight 1061 from MIA to Los Angeles International Airport.

Video shows Mohammadi turning violent when she was told that she would not be permitted onto the flight because she was barefoot.

‘We’re not leaving! We’re not leaving!’ Mohammadi is filmed yelling at the counter agent.

She then climbs over the ticket counter and appear to attempt to kick at the agent.

Arteaga grabs Mohammadi from behind and pulls her away from the counter so as to restrain her.

Mohammadi, who is slurring her words, starts yelling at the agent again before Arteaga led her away.

Miami-Dade police were called to the scene. Officers are seen above as Arteaga and Mohammadi are arguing with them at the terminal entrance

‘She’s high on something,’ a woman who filmed the incident from behind the ticket counter is heard saying.

Another video filmed on a cell phone moments later shows airport police talking with the couple at what appears to be the terminal entrance gate.

Mohammadi is seen being restrained by her boyfriend as she talks loudly at one of the officers.

Arteaga is then seen threatening to sue an unidentified individual, though the reason for this is unclear.

The unidentified man then walks toward his car and lets out a large dog that resembled a German Shepherd.

The couple appears to stare at the dog for a few moments before Miami-Dade police intervene.

Arteaga and Mohammadi then argue with one of the officers for several minutes. Both of them raise their voices at the officer as they accuse the other man of ‘attacking us with a dog.’

Arteaga, who is recording with his cell phone, taunts the officers and demands to get their badge numbers.

He and Mohammadi continued to raise their voices at the cops, who show restraint as the couple dares the officers to arrest them.

‘Are you going to arrest me?’ Mohammadi repeatedly asks one of the officers as she approaches him and makes hand gestures.

Arteaga is then seen trying to restrain Mohammadi by placing his arm around her neck. During the entire time, both of them are yelling at the four police officers.

When one of the officers comes over to warn the couple, the argument escalates.

Finally, the officers lose their patience and try to pry the two of them apart. It took several minutes for the officers to separate the two after a scuffle.

They then place handcuffs on their wrists.

Mohammadi told a local Miami television news station that she and her boyfriend had been drinking tequila at Voodoo Lounge before they arrived at the airport on Sunday

Arteaga is seen bent over the hood of a police car as an officer detains him while Mohammadi is handcuffed while lying on her stomach on the pavement while another cop watches over her.

Mohammadi and Arteaga were taken to Miami-Dade County Jail.

Arteaga was charged with disorderly conduct, battery on a police officer, resisting arrest with violence, and resisting arrest without violence.

Mohammadi was charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting an officer without violence.

‘We went through TSA, we had everything checked out, they didn’t realize she didn’t have her shoes,’ Arteaga told WSVN-TV.

Mohammadi was asked why she thought she would get away with attacking a ticket agent.

‘OK, and I get that, and I will take 100% responsibility,’ she said.

When asked why she thought she would be allowed on a plane without wearing shoes, she said: ‘OK, you know what? I don’t go on the airport that often.’

Mohammadi later admitted that before arriving at the airport, she and Arteaga were drinking tequila at the Voodoo Lounge, a rooftop bar in Miami.

Arteaga insisted that he tried to calm Mohammadi down during their encounter with police.

On her Instagram account, Mohammadi and Arteaga are seen after they apparently were released from jail.

Mohammadi posted a video on Wednesday showing her and Arteaga walking around South Florida and bragging about how people are noticing them on the street after the video of their airport meltdown went viral.

‘We’re walking around like normal civilians…and people literally are stopping us and saying: “You guys are crazy!”’ she said.

‘We’ve got fans out here!’

‘F*** American Airlines!’ Mohammadi says in the video.

After arriving back in Los Angeles, Mohammadi posted a clip referring to herself and her boyfriend as the ‘Miami Bonnie and Clyde.’

A spokesperson for American Airlines told DailyMail.com: ‘After being informed of our policy, the customers became irate and one attempted to strike an American team member at the gate.

‘Violence of any kind is not tolerated by American Airlines.

‘We thank the Miami-Dade Police Department for their quick action to ensure the safety of our customers and team members.’
