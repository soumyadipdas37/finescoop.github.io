Erin McNaught has shown off her bruised and battered body in a dramatic post on Instagram on Monday.

The 38-year-old model shared a naked selfie with a series of painful-looking bruises scattered across one of her arms, her ribcage and her chest.

Erin revealed she acquired the bruises when her 'jump out of a helicopter' went 'wrong'.

The former Miss Universe contestant is currently filming for the upcoming adventure reality series, SAS: Who Dares Wins.  

'No, that's not dirt. It's bruising. (The strip of unbruised flesh is where my sports bra was!),' she captioned the photo. 

'Apparently water is just as hard as concrete when your jump out of a helicopter goes wrong.'

Commenting on her photo, Erin's husband of seven years, English rapper Example, also known as Elliot John Gleave, pointed out that she 'got it very wrong'. 

'Tonight on "When Helicopter Jumps Go Wrong" we meet Erin. A helicopter jumper who sadly... got it very wrong. But first... Tony the fear,' the 38-year-old wrote. 

It's Erin's first Instagram post in weeks, after she revealed earlier this month that she was taking some time off, presumably to film the demanding series.

In an Instagram post on August 12, Erin revealed Example was going to be caring for the couple's two young sons, Evander, five, and Ennio, three: 'You finally get your wish to be a stay-at-home dad!! Enjoy baby, you got this'. 

SAS will follow 14 celebrities as they attempt the intense selection process for the elite Special Forces army unit.

Under the guidance of former Special Forces soldiers, they will have to endure both physical and psychological challenges.
