Brian Austin Green was a sizzling sensation in a clinging black T-shirt as he stepped out in Los Angeles this Thursday.

The 47-year-old showed off his toned arms and sprawl of tattoos as he picked up a couple of boxes of takeaway.

He made sure to take the precaution of wearing a camouflage face covering as he emerged from lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Brian, who shot to fame on Beverly Hills 90210, slipped into a charcoal pair of cutoff sweats and blue shoes for his latest outing.

The smoldering estranged husband of Megan Fox warded off the California rays with a pair of sleek sunglasses whilst out and about.

That very same day the Hollywood heartthrob fired up his Instagram page to upload a selfie of himself with his chickens.

'Moved them in through the door,' he captioned the selfie in which he gave his roughly 470,000 Instagram followers a thumbs up. 'Almost done !!!'

On May 18 amid rumors of her fling with Machine Gun Kelly, Brian emotionally revealed on his podcast ...With Brian Austin Green that Megan had left him.

Since the split went public Brian has been glimpsed out on dates with Maxim model Tina Louise and former 'child bride' Courtney Stodden.

Brian has four sons - Noah, seven, Bodhi, six, Journey, four, by Megan as well as Kassius, 18, by his ex-fiancee Vanessa Marcil.

Vanessa has publicly weighed in on Brian's marital collapse, writing on Instagram: 'Megan finally living her life for herself is in itself a gift to her children.'

Brian got the Instagram comment: 'You know what’s worse than going through a very public break up….the last baby momma chiming in to bring up old sh*t to add more fire to a very public break up. 17 years ago you broke up…maybe she needs to move on…I mean she never loved you anyways??? !!' to which he replied: 'agree.'

The TV beefcake has also posted a Tupac Shakur quote to Instagram in what was widely perceived as a veiled message to an ex.

'Just because you lost me as a friend doesn't mean you gained me as an enemy. I am bigger than that. I still wanna see u eat, just not at my table,' read the quote.

Megan and Machine Gun Kelly met early this year while shooting the movie Midnight In The Switchgrass in Puerto Rico.

The movie had its productions suspended in March over the coronavirus lockdowns but resumed in July, with both Megan and the slender rapper back on set.

However this week TMZ reported that the production has had to stop again on account of two crew members contracting COVID-19.
