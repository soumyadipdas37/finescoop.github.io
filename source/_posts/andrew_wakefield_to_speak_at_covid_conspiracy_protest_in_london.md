The disgraced doctor whose false claims that the MMR vaccine caused autism led thousands of parents not to get their children protected against deadly diseases is to speak at a conspiracy event against the coronavirus vaccine in London.

Andrew Wakefield, who was struck off the medical register in 2010 for showing a 'callous disregard' for the welfare of children, will appear at the allegedly medic-focused rally on Saturday which calls on its attendees to 'resist and act' against the life-saving jabs.

It has been organised by the new face of Britain's anti-vaccination movement, Kate Shemirani, a suspended nurse who has compared public health restrictions to the Holocaust.

In a Twitter outburst this week, she accused doctors and nurses of conducting a 'genocide' during the pandemic and serving the 'Third Reich'.

The mother, 54, appeared next to Piers Corbyn, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's brother, at an anti-mask rally in London last month. Mr Corbyn was fined £10,000 for breaching then-lockdown restrictions meaning people cannot meet in groups larger than 30 people. 

Speakers at the event in Trafalgar Square include a former nurse who has claimed there is 'no evidence' that the virus exists, and an alleged doctor that touted completely unproven allegations that the flu vaccine can make patients test positive for coronavirus.

Shamed nurse Kate Shemirani, who is due to host a rally in Trafalgar Square on Saturday, has promoted bogus claims on social media that vaccines are poisonous. (She is pictured above at an anti-lockdown rally in London last month)

She brags about being a 'natural nurse in a toxic world' to her thousands of social media followers. 

And Kate Sherimani's main bogus theory is that Covid-19 is fake.

She says that PCR tests — proven to spot the coronavirus — are wrong and that the virus cannot actually be spotted. 

But Ms Sherimani, who claims to be from Tonbridge in Kent, also peddles out the completely untrue claim that vaccines 'shorten your life'. 

In arguments with followers calling her out for her anti-vaxx propaganda, she has admitted to being a follower of Andrew Wakefield.

Mr Wakefield claimed the MMR jab caused autism in research that was published in the 1990s and blamed for driving people to avoid getting their jabs. 

But the study was discredited, he was thrown off the medical register after the results of the research were found to be faked. He had a side-project of vaccine earning him money.

Ms Shermani — who was suspended from the Nursing and Midwifery register last month over her comments — also claims the NHS, Britain's favourite institution, is a 'kill machine'. 

Her LinkedIn profile says she has 'extensively studied nutrition and it's relationship with degenerative diseases'.

Ms Shemirani — who claims to be 'a natural nurse in a toxic world' — has previously decried the coronavirus pandemic as a 'plandemic scamdemic' and claimed all vaccines are 'poison' that are 'not proven to work'.

On Twitter earlier this week she asked her followers whether the public would wake up 'on the cattle truck? Or in the showers?' She added: 'Murder. Genocide. The NHS is the new Auschwitz.' 

The mother, has also accused the authorities of 'genocide of the elderly, vulnerable and infirm' during the pandemic.

She has shared links to the widely discredited conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was built by the Chinese government and released on its population. 

Scientists have carried out extensive tests on the virus and found its genetics show 'no sign' of man-made changes, and that it evolved naturally in the wild. They add that Covid-19 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans.

Piers Morgan has slammed anti-vaccine campaigners on social media as 'imbeciles' who he said will stop the world 'defeating' the virus.

'These people are so dangerous,' he wrote. 'If we get a vaccine and people don't take it because imbeciles like this persuade them not to, we will never defeat coronavirus.'

The NHS says all vaccines are 'safe and important' as a way to prevent infectious diseases.

The Government will be handing out 30million doses of the flu vaccine this year, in an attempt to stop the health service being hit by a 'double-whammy' of flu and coronavirus.

Dr John McCauley, director of the WHO collaborating centre for influenza at the Francis Crick Institute, said people should get vaccinated against flu because it is like an 'insurance policy'.

'(A flu infection) may not occur but should it occur, you will wish you'd done it.

'You should get vaccinated, and it should be encouraged to ensure everyone is doing their bit for themselves and the NHS.'

The Nursing and Midwifery Council is investigating Ms Shemirani for making statements linking the coronavirus vaccines to 5G mobile phone technology.

She was represented at an interim hearing in July by Mark Steele, a campaigner against 5G phone masts.

At the hearing, both Ms Shemirani and Mr Steele attacked the panel for not wanting to hear the 'facts' about vaccines and 5G, it was reported.

Mr Steele accused the nursing regulator of being complicit in genocide, it is claimed. Ms Shemirani said nurses who made accusations against her did so because they were overweight and jealous. She added: 'We all know what women can be like.'

Her Facebook account has been removed for 'repeatedly violating policies against harmful misinformation' and her Instagram account was taken down on Wednesday.

Her Twitter following has more than trebled over the last four weeks to 24,000.

Wakefield had a paper published in 1998 in The Lancet claiming there was a link between the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism.

But the study was later retracted after it was found he had coerced his 12 volunteers taking part and fiddled the figures to provide the results he wanted.

Despite this the paper caused a scare meaning many parents did not get their children vaccinated, resulting in a resurgence of several deadly diseases in the US, UK and Ireland that had previously been under control.

When Andrew Wakefield's paper claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was published by the Lancet in 1998 it caused a vaccine scare, with thousands of parents deciding to keep them away from their children.

But by 2004 holes had started to appear in his paper after other scientists found they could not replicate his findings.

This led to a two-and-a-half-year investigation by the General Medical Council which struck him off the list for 'abusing his position of trust' and showing 'callous disregard' for the welfare of children.

They found Wakefield had failed to declare a number of conflicting interests when he submitted the study, including the fact that he and several of the children in it were involved in a lawsuit to show that MMR was linked to autism.

They also said he had acted against his patients' best interests and mistreated developmentally delayed children, and had 'failed in his duties as a responsible consultant'.

Is it safe to take the MMR vaccine?

The NHS says there is 'absolutely no' evidence that the MMR vaccine is harmful to humans.

The World Health Organisation said in 2003, following an extensive review, that there is no evidence to support a link between MMR and autism.
