At 15 months of age, most toddlers can just say a few words and have recently learned to walk and climb.

But one fearless tot has taken climbing to new heights!

Fifteen-month-old toddler, Ezzy, wouldn't stop clambering all over their furniture so his parents built him his very own climbing wall instead.

The indoor climbing wall is complete with multi-coloured grips, handles and safety crash mats below for a soft landing.

However, the new climbing wall only spurred the 'powerful' tot on from strength to strength.

An incredible video shows Ezzy, with a baby's dummy in his mouth, scaling the wall with ease.

He moves confidently up the wall, reaching the climbing holds until he nears the top and then drops to the safety mat below.

The clip was uploaded to Twitter on September 21 with the caption: 'My friend built his kid a climbing wall to get him to stop climbing furniture and it only made the tot more powerful.'

It has already been viewed over 500,000 times with people commenting on the tot's skill and natural climbing ability.

One person wrote: 'Holy sh**! He’s already using weight shifting and leg position technique naturally, that I LEARNED as a beginning climber!'

Climbing as a competitive sport will make its debut at the next Olympics in Tokyo, due to be held in 2021.

Perhaps we are watching a future Olympian in the making?
