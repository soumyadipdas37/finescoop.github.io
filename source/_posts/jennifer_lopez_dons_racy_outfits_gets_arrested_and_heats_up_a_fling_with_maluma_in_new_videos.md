The Bronx beauty's next film Marry Me with Maluma and Owen opens on February 12, 2021. It's a romantic comedy directed by Kat Coiro.

According to the film's website, J-Lo plays musical superstar Kat Valdez.

Owen Wilson is Charlie Gilbert, a math teacher, and they are 'total strangers who agree to marry and then get to know each other.'

The film is an 'unlikely romance about two different people searching for something real in a world where value is based on likes and followers, Marry Me is a modern love story about celebrity, marriage and social media.

'Kat Valdez (Lopez) is half of the sexiest celebrity power couple on Earth with hot new music supernova Bastian (Maluma, making his feature-film debut). As Kat and Bastian’s inescapable hit single, “Marry Me,” climbs the charts, they are about to be wed before an audience of their fans in a ceremony that will streamed across multiple platforms.'

But then things change when divorced high-school math teacher Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) has been dragged to the concert by his daughter Lou (Chloe Coleman, HBO’s Big Little Lies) and his best friend (Sarah Silverman). 

'When Kat learns, seconds before the ceremony, that Bastian has cheated on her with her assistant, her life turns left as she has a meltdown on stage, questioning love, truth and loyalty. As her gossamer world falls away, she locks eyes with a stranger—a face in the crowd.

In a moment of 'inspired insanity,' Kat chooses to marry Charlie. 

'What begins as an impulsive reaction evolves into an unexpected romance. But as forces conspire to separate them, the universal question arises: Can two people from such different worlds bridge the gulf between them and build a place where they both belong?'
