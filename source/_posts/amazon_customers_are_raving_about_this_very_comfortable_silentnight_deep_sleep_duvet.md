With the evenings drawing in and temperatures slowly dropping, it's time to get your bedding ready for winter. 

And there's never been a better time to change up your summer duvet for one of a heavier tog, as Amazon has just slashed the prices of the Silentnight Deep Sleep 10.5 Tog Duvet.

Costing only £21 for a double duvet, the Silentnight Deep Sleep Duvet has become a big hit with consumers, even becoming an Amazon Choice for the 'Double Duvet' category.

Amazon has taken 43 per cent of the Silentnight Deep Sleep 10.5 Tog Duvet- perfect for getting your bed ready for colder autumn nights 

Amazon customers have already left heaps of praise for the hypoallergenic Deep Sleep Duvet, with 80 per cent of shoppers awarding it the full five stars.

Describing it as 'warm, cosy and comfortable' and 'an absolute dream to sleep under', it's no surprise that hundreds of shoppers are snapping them up.

Now at a bargain price, it's the perfect time to see what the hype is about.  

When buying a duvet, it's important to look at the tog. The higher the tog, the warmer it is and so more appropriate for colder nights. 

At 10.5, the Silentnight Deep Sleep Duvet is ideal for autumn and winter. Generously filled with hollow fibre, it's perfectly suited to those that suffer from allergies and is thick enough to trap heat, making it extra warm and snuggly. 

Hundreds of reviews mention the 'cosy' and 'comfortable' nature of the duvet. One satisfied sleeper praised the quality of the duvet, saying: 'Like sleeping on a fluffy cloud. Purchased to replace an existing duvet, from the first night to present the duvet is light and comfy.  

'I first slept on top and felt like I was asleep on a cloud then, later on, got under it and didn't want to leave. Keeps you nice and warm but not too warm just snug. Really recommended and been about three months still like new.'

Shoppers have awarded the duvet a near-perfect score on Amazon, calling it 'it's nice toasty warm and snuggly'

Another agreed, writing: 'It's warm, cosy and comfortable. An absolute dream to sleep under and not too heavy at all.'

'A lovely thick and soft duvet!' wrote another 'Easy to wash. Very cosy on those long winter nights!!'

One enthusiastic shopper even commented on how the duvet has changed their quality of sleep, writing: 'Absolutely amazing, so cosy and comfortable and I have really noticed a difference in the quality of my sleep.' 

The Silentnight Deep Sleep range also includes the Deep Sleep Pillow. The pillow has also received positive feedback in regards to soothing body aches and neck pains and is also on sale for £15.49 for two.
