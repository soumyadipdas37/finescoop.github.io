A hot water bottle may seem like an old-fashioned way to keep warm but it's come a long way from basic square rubber versions. 

If you're looking for something a little more luxurious and cosy, Amazon has you covered. The site is currently selling a full-length water bottle, which warms your entire body - and it has received rave reviews from shoppers.

The YuYu Body Bottle is 75cm long and comes with a multinational strap, which is ideal for wrapping around the stomach, neck or shoulders. What's more, it claims to keep you warm for up to six hours with less than a kettle of water.

The YuYu Body Bottle has received rave reviews from shoppers who love that it can be used for the entire body and that it stays warm for up to six hours 

One reviewer dubbed the £24.99 YuYu Body Bottle 'an absolute godsend', while other shoppers raved about its 'snuggly and versatile' design, calling it a 'fantastic invention'.

Many customers have delighted over its ability to warm the whole body on chilly nights, and one praised it for giving 'comfort and pain relief in larger, awkward areas'.

'Oh my goodness, I love it,' wrote another delighted shopper. 'It is the nicest thing to curl around, and also you can wrap it round your waist if you have a sore back or stomach. Also feels amazing around your neck, I think because of the deep dimples in it. Retains heat well too!'

A third reviewer wrote: 'This is so easy to use and is great for relief of pain for my neck and shoulders... I would highly recommend this bottle.... it also has the ties so you can keep it in place without holding it up. it is easy to fill up and empty and very well made.' 

The elongated hot water bottle can be wrapped around your body, and the extendable strap feature means you can also enjoy hands-free heat

The 75cm long product is available in four colours, including brown, grey, zebra and grey spot, and is covered in a washable soft fleece cover.

It also features a handy strap so you can tie it around your shoulders or waist so you can enjoy hands-free heat. Amazon reviewers have been so impressed with the giant bottles that 75 per cent of shoppers have awarded it a full five stars.

One chuffed customer wrote: 'The long shape keeps the whole body warm and being slim does not get in the way while sleeping.'

Another shopper raved about the heat retention: 'The water is said to stay hot for 4 - 6 hours, but I find the bottle is still hot under my duvet in the morning. 

'It can be tied around your body (waist, stomach, back, or higher around shoulders, or even longways) and it can even lie alongside you in bed. I liked it so much that we bought them for our mother and step-mother, to much delight.'
