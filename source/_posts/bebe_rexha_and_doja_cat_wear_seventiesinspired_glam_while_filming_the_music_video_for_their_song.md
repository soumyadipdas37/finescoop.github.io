Juicy: Doja's song Juicy was nominated for Top R&B song at the upcoming BBMAs though many of her fans slammed Billboard for snubbing her on major categories where she was deserving of nominations

The video shoot comes a day after Doja received the news that her song Juicy was nominated for Top R&B song at the upcoming Billboard Music Awards. 

Sharing the news with her 7.4M Instagram followers, Doja wrote that she was 'so honored to be nominated at the 2020 BBMAs' which will take place on October 14th. 

Though the announcement seemingly came in good spirits, many of her fans seemed to believe the artist had been snubbed for a number of reasons. 

Users flooded Twitter with comments that her song Juicy should have been nominated for Pop, with many stating that it was unfair that a Black woman had to be 'pigeon-holed' into an urban category.

Snubbed: One user commented on her post 'Love that but since when is juicy RnB?' to which Doja replied 'It's not' with the shoulder shrugging emoji

One Instagram user commented on her post 'Love that but since when is juicy RnB?' to which Doja replied 'It's not' with the shoulder shrugging emoji. 

Others spoke out that Doja should have been up for Top Rap Female Artist and Top New Artist after her hit song Say So led her straight to number one on the charts.

Despite the dissatisfaction on behalf of her fans, Doja seemed to take the nomination in stride and appeared to focus on the things she could control at the video shoot. 

The hot new artist also scooped up the PUSH award for best new artist at the VMAs despite the brewing Billboard nomination drama.

Bebe who recently went public with new boyfriend, Keyan Safyari, brought her new man to set, giving him a glimpse into her daily life. 

The pair who were first linked in March, were spotted out on numerous occasions before she made it Instagram official with a birthday tribute last week.

Doja had been linked to musician Johnny Utah since 2019 though the pair broke it off in February. 

The singer confirmed the news in an Instagram live in February, sharing with her followers 'Everything is ok. I unfollowed my ex-boyfriend and everything is ok. Nothing weird going on. No drama, or weird shit going on. Shit just didn't work out' she said.
