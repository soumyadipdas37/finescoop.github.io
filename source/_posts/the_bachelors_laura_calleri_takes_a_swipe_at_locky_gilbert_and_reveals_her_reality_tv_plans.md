The Bachelor's Laura Calleri was sent packing by Locky Gilbert on Wednesday night in a shock elimination which saw five ladies get the boot from the mansion.

And on Wednesday, the 25-year-old took nasty a swipe at the former Survivor star, saying they would never have worked out because their clashing interests in life.

She told The Daily Telegraph: 'I have never been to Bali. From there, it was a bit like I didn't know if we were going to click, especially because fake designer stuff is a massive faux pas and I am really not about that.' 

'I got ripped off by a guy that likes Bintang!' The Bachelor's Laura Calleri, 25, took a swipe at Locky Gilbert following her elimination on Wednesday

Instead, Laura is hoping she'll be cast on Bachelor in Paradise for her second shot at love.

'Surely they would be able to do some good matchmaking for me now since I got ripped off by a guy that likes Bintang,' she said.

In her first meeting with Locky, the brunette beauty made it no secret she liked the finer things in life when she told him that the best present she had ever received was a 'Louis Vuitton purse'.

Laura, who is a marketing co-ordinator, also told the publication that she was unapologetic for her expensive taste. 

'That is how I am and I don't apologise for that. I just want to make sure that the guy I end up with is on the same page as me about liking nice things,' she said. 

Laura was among the five ladies booted out of the mansion on Wednesday.

'This is definitely the first time I have ever been rejected by a guy. I don't care because he obviously likes basic girls, and that's not me. I ain't basic,' she pouted.
