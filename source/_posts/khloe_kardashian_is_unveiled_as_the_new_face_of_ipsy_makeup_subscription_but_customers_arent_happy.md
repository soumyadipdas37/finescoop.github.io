Beauty subscription service Ipsy is facing backlash for unveiling Khloe Kardashian as the new face of the brand.

While some customers fond of the reality star welcomed the news, many expressed their disappointment with the choice referencing Khloe's ever-changing appearance using Photoshop and her rumored plastic surgery. 

Ipsy announced the news on their Facebook page on Monday evening, writing: 'Meet our newest brand partner Khloé Kardashian! Here’s everything you need to know about her passion for beauty:'

Ipsy unveiled Khloe Kardashian as the new face of their brand on Monday and the decision was met with a lot of backlash 

The company shared a link to their blog with a lengthy description of Khloe's love for beauty products and list of must-have cosmetic items.

The post quickly garnered dozens of comments from customers, many of them negative.

'Her passion for beauty was a whole new face..' one person quipped.

Another disappointed beauty-lover wrote, 'Ipsy we want a real woman someone relatable, someone with a real face, someone that is humble. This isn't it, she isn't it. Do better Ipsy.' 

'I'll pass on all things beauty from someone who chops and screws her face for sport and then still need to photoshop every pic' came another unimpressed response.

'Do better Ipsy': The announcement immediately garnered dozens of comments from customers, many of them negative

Mixed response: While some customers fond of the reality star welcomed the news, many expressed their disappointment with the choice 

Ipsy is a customizable service that ships glam bags filled with beauty and makeup products to subscribers for a monthly fee ranging from $12 to $37. 

Some customers considered canceling their subscriptions following the Khloe news.

'I guess it's time to cancel my subsciption. Will not support anything Kardashian/ Jenner. So disaapointing. Smdh' read one comment from an unimpressed Facebook user.

Furthermore, Khloe's appearance in the Ipsy promotional photos also raised questions.

'THAT'S KHLOE? I didn't recognize her. So, is her new beauty product line about changing how you look? No thanx. Comm'on Ipsy - I thought you were all about everyday women bringing out their best? I suddenly feel out of place.'  

Unrecognizable: Some customers questioned Khloe's appearance in the Ipsy images and considered canceling their subscription to the service 

Khloe is that you? One of the promotional snaps for Khloe's new gig drew comparisons to Beyonce

Looks familiar: There was more than one post on Twitter comparing the E! star to Beyonce

Her sultry brunette styling with the vivid pink and red background led to some fans making comparisons to Beyonce in her music video for Check On It.

While another Twitter user accused the star of going 'full-on Beyonce drag'. 

Khloe is no stranger to criticism for her changing looks, most of the time in snaps she shares to her Instagram account.

The most infamous of which came in May when she posted a photo from a KUWTK shoot, showing off her bronze figure in a white corset top.

But it was her face that puzzled her fans most as it appeared to be slimmed down and her eyes seemed to be a different shape and angled differently than usual.

Real? Khloe, 36, has been accused of editing her photos on social media to the point of being unrecognizable 

Editing wizardry: In August Khloe became the center of another photoshopping scandal after a scene from KUWTK was aired (right) in which she looked nothing like a snap she shared from the shoot two months earlier (left)

Then in August the untouched images were revealed when the scene aired on the E! show and one viewer immediately took a screengrab to do a side-by-side comparison with highly photoshopped image on social media.

In June a source told Us Weekly that Khloe doesn't care what people think about her appearance.

'Khloe doesn’t care about the backlash she's been getting from fans saying she doesn't look like herself in her recent photos. 

'She thinks she looks great. And actually [she] does not care what people think as long as she's happy.'

Khloe also seems to have a sense of humor about it as she clapped back at a fan who asked why she looked so different by joking: 'My weekly face transplant clearly.'
