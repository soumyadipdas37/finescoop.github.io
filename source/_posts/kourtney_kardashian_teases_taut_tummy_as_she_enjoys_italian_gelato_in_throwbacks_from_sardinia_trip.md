She recently took to her Instagram Story with some sage motherhood advice she shared with sisters Kim and Khloe in a group text.

Kourtney wrote: 'The 5 A’s of good parenting : Attention, Appreciation, Affection, Acceptance, Allowing. When these are met in children, they are able to have secure attachment relationships later in life.'

The exes have certainly been spending plenty of time together with their kids during quarantine, after he split with girlfriend Sofia Richie, 22, back in May.

But a source told HollywoodLife that they're strictly co-parents: 'So much time has passed since they have been in a romantic relationship and they are not interested in rekindling it. 

'They are just trying to be good parents and if that means they hang out more together, that is totally something they can figure out. They are very happy to be in each other’s lives forever even if it doesn’t return to a deeper love connection that they had in the past.' 

Kourtney is preparing to bid farewell to KUWTK for good, when they air their 20th and final season, after 13 years on E!

She left the show back in March, later citing a 'toxic environment' to Vogue Arabia as reason for her departure.
