Ciarran's womanising behaviour landed him in hot water on Bachelor in Paradise.

Last month, it was reported that Ciarran was romantically pursuing Big Brother star Sophie Budack.  

As spotted by fan account Bachie Funny, Ciarran posted a flirty comment on Sophie's Instagram Live video, which was being broadcast from her home in the Netherlands.

Despite being located in Melbourne, Ciarran commented on the 25-year-old brunette's video: 'Babe hurry up I'm downstairs with coffee.'

Bachie Funny captioned the post: 'After going through every female contestant from all eight seasons of The Bachelor, Ciarran now appears to be moving onto the Big Brother 2020 cast.'

Indeed, Ciarran has enjoyed a slew of romantic conquests since appearing on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette last year.

After splitting from his long-term girlfriend Renee Barrett last year, Ciarran signed up to Bachelor in Paradise, where he romanced Abbie Chatfield, Jessica Brody and Kiki Morris.   

It comes after it was revealed that Ciarran and Sophie's have been close friends for many years.

In early July, fans were shocked when Ciarran posted what appeared to be a throwback photo of himself and Sophie to celebrate her birthday.

'Happy Birthday chick @sophiebudack,' he captioned the photo.

The Big Brother star reposted Ciarran's sweet birthday message to her on her own Instagram stories.

When asked by Daily Mail Australia about their relationship Sophie said: 'We've been besties for years and years. We're both from Darwin.' 

Sophie's most recent relationship was with model Chad Hurst, 27, whom she met in the Big Brother house.

However, the status of their romance became unclear last month when Sophie announced she was moving to the Netherlands - leaving Chad behind in Sydney.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ciarran and Talia for comment in relation to this story.
