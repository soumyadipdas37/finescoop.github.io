The biggest visible difference so far is the backyard.

The outdoor seating area, swimming pool and small gym set-up on the synthetically turfed lawn have been slightly altered for the new season.

The patio furniture has been swapped, while outdoor vertical garden walls and timber decking around the pool appears to be a darker shade.

Spot the difference: Last year's reboot had more neutral tones used for its outdoor settings near the pool

It's expected that the interior of the house will be completely redesigned with new decor and refreshed colour scheme also.

In June, a casting call said filming of the series was set to begin in October 2020, and those applying were expected to keep at least 12 weeks free to be on the show.

Big Brother was previously filmed in a $13million house and production facility at Gold Coast's Dreamworld, but the property was burned down by children in 2019.

Channel Seven's reboot earlier this year saw a new format introduced Down Under.

For the first time in Australian Big Brother history, housemates evicted each other from the game which saw powerful alliances form and friendships crumble.
