Gareth Bale could be set for a stunning Premier League return as he prepares to have crunch talks with Real Madrid over a potential exit.

Reports in Spain say that the Welsh wizard could be set for a move to either Manchester United or Tottenham in the coming window after being outcasted at the LaLiga champions by head coach Zinedine Zidane. 

Bale's return to England would be one of the major moves of the European summer transfer window, with the Real Madrid star's arrival potentially having an impact at the top of the Premier League table.

MANCHESTER UNITED

There is no doubt that Bale would be the marquee attacking signing that Manchester United fans are dreaming of, but do the Red Devils actually need to sign Bale?

The 31-year-old's arrival would likely break up the exciting front three of Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, who all fired United to a top-four spot after the coronavirus break last season.   

Yet the way in which Ole Gunnar Solksjaer's side have been targeting Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho all summer shows that the club are looking to provide extra competition in that area anyway this summer.

Greenwood, who was caught sneaking Icelandic girls into his hotel room along with fellow Three Lions debutant Phil Foden of Manchester City this week, is inexperienced at 18 and although he starred towards the end of last season Bale is proven in the English top flight. 

There is no denying the youngster has the talent but he still needs time to grow and develop in order to improve his game. Working with the likes of Bale could push Greenwood on even more.

Bale could line-up on the right hand side of the Red Devils' front three in place of Greenwood given that the Welshman is comfortable with both feet and is a serial goalscorer and creator.

Bale would also have a comfortable role in the United side and would not need to track back given Aaron Wan-Bissaka's defensive competences. 

No Premier League player managed more tackles than the English right back last term, with the 22-year-old an expert in one-on-one defending, meaning Bale can stay high up the pitch.   

One issue where Bale would struggle at United, however, is the number of egos currently at Old Trafford, whose dressing room is occupied by big-money stars.

How would they feel about another big-money player coming in and hogging all the limelight?

TOTTENHAM

Gareth Bale is still a cult hero at Tottenham, having dazzled Spurs fans with some eye-catching performances in a six-year spell at White Hart Lane. 

Bale made his name at Spurs playing on the left wing, with his devastating displays against Inter Milan in 2010 one of the key career moments that elevated the Wales captain to the top European stage. 

Though Spurs boss Jose Mourinho would likely use him on the right-hand side to form a chilling combination with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min at the top of the pitch.

Bale's potential role on the right-hand side would work nicely as Spurs play a lop-sided system which sees Mourinho place more of an emphasis on the right wing. 

Left back Ben Davies often tucks in to create a back three, leaving right back Matt Doherty the freedom to go further up the pitch and become an extra attacking option.

A wider role from the Spurs right back would allow Bale more opportunities to cut inside on his left foot, as Doherty would act as a distraction for the opposite full backs against the right sort of opposition.

Not only would Bale improve Spurs from a tactical point of view, he would also help change the club's mentality. 

Several players at Tottenham are yet to lift a league title or even a trophy in their careers, with this lack of title-winning experience letting Spurs down in crucial moments over the past few seasons.  

Mourinho is trying to change this culture in north London - since his arrival in November last year, over half of his signings at Spurs have lifted league titles in their career.

Bale has played and scored in multiple successful Champions League finals during his career

Bale is a completely different animal compared to the likes of Joe Hart, Gedson Fernandes and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, however. The Welshman has both won and scored in multiple Champions League finals - something Spurs failed to do in 2019 - and has also guided Real Madrid to domestic league titles too.  

That kind of experience would cost money, however, with reports in Spain saying that Spurs owner Daniel Levy simply does not have the funds to sanction such a move.  

Though several close contacts of Mourinho, including ex-Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon, claims that the Portuguese coach is a huge admirer of the Wales winger and a loan move could be agreed by Real Madrid. 

A move United probably looks more of an attractive option from a playing point of view, though Bale would be returning home to Spurs if he chooses north London as his next destination. 

It's probably worth saying that Tottenham need him more than Manchester United do too.
