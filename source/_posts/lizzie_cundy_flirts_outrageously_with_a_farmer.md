Lizzie Cundy flirted up a storm with a farmer on Thursday when she asked him for directions after getting lost in the countryside in Hampshire. 

The 52-year-old soon had a smile on her face when she stepped out of her new white Mercedes in a bid to ask for assistance. 

And she was in luck, when a tractor-driving hero stepped in to help the damsel in distress. 

Sowing The Seeds Of Love: Lizzie Cundy flirted outrageously with a farmer when she got lost in the countryside in Hampshire wearing sexy red leather trousers om Thursday

Which way? She needn't have worried about being lost because a tractor-driving hero stepped in to help the damsel in distress

With a big smile on her face, Lizzie was dressed to the nines for her outing, wearing spray-on red leather trousers. 

She teamed it with a form-fitting matching red polka dot top which flashed a hint of her bra. 

The mother-of-two was sporting lightened Farrah Fawcett-style waves which she had dyed herself while in lockdown. 

Oh dear: Lizzie had been cruising along in her new Mercedes convertible when she came a cropper

I'm running late: She took a call on her phone, no doubt telling her pals she wouldn't be too much longer

But sadly, it looked as though Lizzie had left her wellies at home and she tottered along in gold killer heels instead.  

Lizzie was forced to cancel her usual lavish plans for her birthday as she marked her 52nd during lockdown in May. 

However in true Lizzie style, she promised a huge party once life returns to normal with the proceeds from the bash going to the National Health Service.

Are you from round here? Lizzie had a big smile on her face as she posed up a storm while talking to the farmer 

Turn left: The farmer was more than happy to help Lizzie out 

Walking tall: She looked picture perfect as she posed with her hands on her hips

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said: I really want to give back and say thank you to the NHS as they have been so incredible and I’m so thankful to have got through the coronavirus myself

'I’m so sad not to be with my family and friends and especially be with my son on my special day but know we will all be together soon...

'Good times are in their way ! I want my party to be the biggest fund raiser for the NHS to give thanks!'
