Amanda looked incredible in the stunning gown which clung to her figure to perfection, the result of gruelling hours spent in the gym.

She wore her blonde locks in loose waves while shielding her eyes with a pair of designer sunglasses to complete the chic look.  

She's been busy filling in for Simon Cowell as head judge on Britain's Got Talent, yet still found time to squeeze in some much needed relaxation time as she enjoyed a romantic getaway to Cliveden House in Berkshire this weekend.

Amanda put on a very loved-up display with her husband Chris Hughes during the trip before sharing a sizzling selfie of her lounging in lace while in bed.

She exuded glamour as she relaxed in a white dressing gown over a black lacy top while reading a book fittingly called The Mistresses Of Cliveden. 

The blonde beauty wore her locks down for the sultry snap and added a slick of pink lipgloss as well as some smokey eyeshadow.

Elsewhere on the trip, Amanda and Chris appeared to enjoy the good weather as she planted a tender kiss on his cheek in a sun-soaked selfie. 

Amanda also shared a black-and-white snap to her Instagram grid, showing her resting against a car while flaunting her toned limbs in white shorts.

Hot stuff: She was radiant as she stepped out after a relaxing weekend 

Taking to Instagram on Sunday, Amanda said: 'Had the best #romantic #weekend with #Chrispy in this historic and infamous place steeeeped in history.

'Thank you to all the staff for looking after us so well... NOT an #ad ( thanks to John on the door for humouring me by taking this pic early this morning)'

Cliveden house is a popular spot for celebs and has hosted an array of famous faces over the years including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Charlie Chaplin.

The property, once owned by William Waldorf Astor, was also the hotel where Meghan Markle stayed the night before her wedding to Price Harry in 2018.
