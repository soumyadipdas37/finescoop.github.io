A crash involving an ambulance and an FDNY fire truck killed a Brooklyn convenience store owner being rushed to a hospital for an apparent heart attack and critically injured his sister who was accompanying him. 

The deadly accident took place at around 12.45am on Thursday, when the fire truck, Ladder 102, smashed into the side of the ambulance at the intersection of Myrtle and Throop avenues in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. 

The patient inside, identified as 59-year-old Jamil 'Mike' Almansouri, was pronounced dead.

Surveillance video shows an ambulance carrying a heart attack patient to Woodhull Medical Center in Brooklyn early Thursday morning 

As the ambulance reaches the intersection of Myrtle and Throop avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant, it is T-boned by a fire truck 

The ladder truck pushes the ambulance into another vehicle that was stopped at a traffic light 

Ladder 102 was en route to a massive fire when it smashed into the ambulance 

Almansouri's sister, 35-year-old Ganna Ahmad, a married mom-of-four, the youngest aged one, was riding along with her brother to Woodhull Medical Center when the accident happened, reported CBS New York. 

According to family members, she suffered a broken back, multiple fractures and is now in a coma at Kings County Hospital Center. 

Her husband arrived at the scene of the collision after failing to reach her by phone or text, and using a GPS to track her phone. 

Deli owner and father-of-seven Jamil 'Mike' Almansouri, 59, was pronounced dead following the crash 

Eight first responders were also hurt in the crash, including two EMTs who were riding in the ambulance and six firefighters from the ladder truck. All were listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital.  

One of the paramedics was being treated for a leg injury and was expected to recover.

The ambulance careened into another car, a 2004 Honda CRV, that was stopped at a traffic light, leaving its two occupants with minor injuries. They were taken to Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. 

As surveillance video obtained by Williamsburg News shows, both the ambulance and the fire truck had their lights on at the time of the crash. The FDNY vehicle was responding to a massive fire on Willoughby Avenue, 

Almansouri was an immigrant from Yemen who owned a deli located a mile from the scene of the crash. He is survived by his wife, who still lives in Yemen, and their seven children, of whom three reside in Brooklyn, reported New York Post. He was also a grandfather. 

'He was the greatest,' the victim's brother, Abdullah Ahmad, told ABC 7 New York. 'Everybody loved him. He was a good-hearted person. He didn't bother nobody.'

Almansouri's sister, who was riding in the back of the ambulance with him, suffered a broken back and is now in a coma 

Six firefighters sustained minor injuries and are expected to recover 

Almansouri's 13-year-old nephew, Muhanand Hassan, recounted how it all started after midnight when his uncle, who suffered from a heart condition, began complaining of chest pains and his sister, Hassan's mother, offered to go with him to the hospital.

It was not until Ganna Ahmad stopped answering her phone that her family found about the crash. 

Her husband jumped in a cab and showed up at the intersection where the collision happened. His son said first responders had to push him away as he kept saying, 'My wife, my wife.' 

The family later went to Woodhull Medical Center and got to see Almansouri one last time. 



'He got, like, blood on his face, his eye was black and purple, and everywhere was purple and his face got, like, big,' the teen recalled. 'They just took him to the other room.'

Ahmad said his uncle, who had lived in Brooklyn for 20 years, was beloved by everyone in the community, including his customers whom he would invite into his apartment above the bodega for traditional meals.  

The accident is under investigation. New York Times reported that officials are looking to determine whether construction scaffolding at the intersection blocked the views of the drivers of the two vehicles.
