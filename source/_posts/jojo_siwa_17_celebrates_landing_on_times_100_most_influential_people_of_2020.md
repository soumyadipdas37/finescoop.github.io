Dance Moms alum JoJo Siwa celebrated scoring a spot on TIME's list of 100 Most Influential People of 2020 on Tuesday calling the honor 'the biggest thing that has ever happened to me.'

Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kim Kardashian West penned the official TIME tribute to the glitter-loving 17-year-old, whom she called 'a ray of sunshine in a world that seems scary right now.'

'She's a great role model for children, and her optimism is more necessary now than ever,' the 39-year-old mother-of-four wrote.

'It's no wonder my seven-year-old daughter North and millions of other children around the world adore her. When North met JoJo last year to fulfill her dream of being part of her YouTube channel, North got really shy. But JoJo, like a big sister, made her feel at home as they dressed up, danced and made slime.'

Kim noted how when her E! reality series premiered in 2007, she was old enough to know who she was and make her own decisions.

'I can't imagine what it's like to live this life at age 17. JoJo embraces it, and I hope she always will,' Kardashian wrote.

'At some point, she'll evolve and grow up a little bit, and that's okay. The people who love and support her will always be there.'

'I can't even begin to tell you how much I love and respect Kim and her whole family,' Siwa - who boasts 51.9M social media followers - wrote on Instagram Tuesday.

'She has always been there for me and is always the nicest human ever.' 

Balloons everywhere! Even though Siwa knew she was on TIME's list, she was still in shock as she celebrated inside the $3.4M 6,111-square-foot Tarzana mansion she bought last December
