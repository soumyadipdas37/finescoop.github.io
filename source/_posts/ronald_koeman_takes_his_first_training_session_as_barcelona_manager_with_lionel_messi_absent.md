Ronald Koeman took his first training session as the new manager of Barcelona as his feud with star Lionel Messi continues.

After the sacking of Quique Setien, Koeman was appointed as the Catalan club's new boss and took no time at all to ruffle a few feathers within the camp.

As talisman and club legend Lionel Messi was absent, the Dutchman was pictured alongside his squad in their first session together ahead of the new LaLiga season.

The Barcelona players were pictured taking part in some basic running drills, with winger Ousmane Demebele pictured jogging in the club's new training kit.

Elsewhere, Gerard Pique was shown with a ball at his feet as he dribbled at a light pace in the Spanish sun. 

However, the most noticeable factor from Koeman's first session was the absence of Argentine attacker Lionel Messi.

The forward has failed to report to the first two days of pre-season with Barcelona, and faces the prospect of a £1million fine as he tries to force a summer exit from the Nou Camp.

Messi has been left frustrated with Barcelona's previous trophy-less season and has disagreed with several key decisions being made as the club prepares for the new season.

Strike partner and best friend to Messi, Luis Suarez, has been told by Koeman that he was not part of the club's plans moving forward as Arturo Vidal, Ivan Rakitic and others all face summer exits as the club descends into chaos.

With Messi trying to force his way out of the club, LaLiga have recently stepped in as some of Europe's elite made their interest known in the 33-year-old. 

Manchester City are said to be leading the race for Messi but must pay £630m release fee

Manchester City are said to be the clear favourites to sign Messi this summer, with the forward said to be keen on re-uniting with former coach Pep Guardiola, but the logistics of any deal for the six-time Balon d'Or winner.

Barca are insisting that club's must pay Messi's staggering £630million release clause in order to open talks with the star, a fee that is clearly unreachable for any club in world football.

LaLiga have backed the Catalan club and have said the player will not be allowed to leave the club on a free transfer this season, should he be able to wiggle his way out of his rather complicated contract.
