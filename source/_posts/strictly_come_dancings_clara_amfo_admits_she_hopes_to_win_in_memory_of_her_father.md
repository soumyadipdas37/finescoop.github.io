She has officially joined the 2020 line-up for Strictly Come Dancing. 

And Clara Amfo hopes to claim Strictly gold in honour of her father, as she revealed on Saturday that his death five years ago was the 'the worst day' of her life. 

The Radio 1 DJ, 36, said that she intends to honour her father's memory by busting out some moves on the ballroom floor for the hit BBC TV show.

Noble cause: She has officially joined the 2020 line-up for Strictly Come Dancing and Clara Amfo hopes to win the show in honour of her father following his death five years ago

She recalled the heartbreaking moment she discovered her microbiologist father, Emmanuel, passed away from the heart attack which changed her life forever. 

Clara was in Paris, France, about to compete in a half marathon when she had a foreboding premonition, and her worst fears came true when she received a series of missed calls from her sister.  

She said to The Mirror: 'That morning I felt compelled to call him. I then looked at my phone and saw all these missed calls from my sister.

'In that moment I thought, "I bet my dad has died". I knew I needed to answer the phone but I really didn’t want to.'

According to Clara, she picked up the phone to a 'visceral and guttural' wail from her sister who revealed the devastating news.     

She added: 'I said "Susan, what? what?" I had to hear her say it. She said: "Dad has died," and I screamed. I’ve never had such a deep ­reaction as I had that day.' 

Emmanuel-originally from Ghana- arrived in the UK in the 1970s with just £25 pounds in his pocket.

He made a home for himself in Eltham, South East London, which Clara said was an area notoriously hostile towards new immigrants. 

Her father than moved to Kingston, Surrey, where he studied his passion and graduated to become a microbiologist.  

A memory that Clara holds dear to her heart is when her father wrote a long birthday card to her, expressing his love and stating she is the glue that holds their family together.   

The radio host felt his death may have had a knock-on effect on her dating life as she divulged that in recent years she has struggled to find her Prince Charming.

During an episode of the Daddy Issues podcast, she said: 'I have wondered if losing him has affected my dating life. 

'I’ve met some d***heads in the last two to three years.  

'I had to snap out of "why did these men treat me so badly. You have to retrace your steps through life and understand why you allowed people to treat you like this.

'Learning about grief made me realise why I attracted certain people into my life.'
