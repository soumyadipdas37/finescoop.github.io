More than 50,000 Twitter users were unable to access the website and app versions of the social media platform Thursday morning due to a worldwide outage.

Down Detector showed the outage started around 9:30am ET and was plaguing parts of the US, Europe and Asia.

Many users were met with an 'error message' when logging in, along with a blank news feed that only reads 'try again' and disabled features - all of which hindered their ability to share tweets. 

The peak of the outage hit around 10am ET, but much of the service was restored around 10:45am ET - some Twitter users may still be experiencing issues.

Typically when one social media site experiences an outage, users flock to Twitter to share their frustrations or ask if anyone else is having problems.

But when Twitter went down, the world may be in a frenzy.

DailyMail.com has reached out to Twitter for comment and has yet to receive a response. 

Down Detector, a platform that monitors website and online service outages, is one of the only places the public can go to check on the outage when Twitter is down. 

The outage appeared around 9:30am and is located in the US, the UK and Japan - other countries in Europe, Asia and South American are also reporting issues

The majority of the outage was plaguing the website, but users reported issues with the iOS and Android apps. 

Down Detector's outage map showed a number of major cities in the US as red, including Seattle, San Francisco, Washington  DC and New York City.

Twitter also went down in Japan, parts of India and Indonesia, along with countries in Europe.

Users shared their frustrations on Down Detector about Twitter going down so early in the day.

Another took this time to take a dig at liberals: 'I hope they fix it by 11:30AM when all the white liberals start rolling out of bed... they have some very important hashtags to tweet out today to save all the helpless minorities they are trying to rescue'
