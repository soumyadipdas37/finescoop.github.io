Scotland and Wales recorded no further victims today. A full round-up of non-hospital deaths with be confirmed this afternoon by the Department of Health.

Data earlier this week shows the number of people dying of Covid-19 continues to fall and is at its lowest level since early March, with 88 fatalities in the week ending August 21.
