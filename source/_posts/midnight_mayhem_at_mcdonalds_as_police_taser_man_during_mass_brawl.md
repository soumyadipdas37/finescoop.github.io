This is the shocking moment a towering reveller barely flinches after he is tasered by police during an altercation in a McDonald's.

At least four police officers are seen talking to customers in the fast-food restaurant in Bethnal Green, east London.

Onlookers claim the rowdy group kicked off after a security guard told them to leave their alcohol outside.

Suddenly one reveller - who is taller than all the officers - charges forward, prompting one officer to deploy his taser.

The man crunches forward as the electric current causes his muscles to spasm but remarkably remains standing the entire time.

A disgruntled customer exclaims: 'I only came here for a f****** chicken sandwich.'

Someone can be heard shouting 'I'm not leaving' as the confrontation begins.

The tall man walks towards one side of the room but his path is blocked by two police officers in the footage, believed to be taken last night.

 Another man rushes forward to intervene but is pushed back as a woman's voice is heard shouting in the background.

The second man continues to push forward before an officer grabs him by the arm and drags him to the floor.

Two women - one wearing grey and another in yellow - appear to try to help the man but are pulled away by officers.

One woman tells police 'he's a little skinny boy' as two officers are seen gathered around the man.

An officer replies: 'Step over there.'

A woman wearing a yellow shirt is seen sat on the floor next to the man as police yell: 'Get up and get away'.

The woman in grey then approaches the man on the floor again. 

She appears to start swinging punches at an officer as she stands next to a third woman who also tries to get involved.

The woman in grey is dragged away by an officer. Someone is heard shouting: 'What is wrong with you? Behave yourself.'

A woman's voice replies: 'F*** off

Meanwhile, the tall man can be seen walking towards a police officer who has his taser raised.

The officer uses his taser on the reveller who lifts his arms to his chest and hunches his head forward.

An onlooker can be heard saying: 'You don't need to taser him man. What the f*** are you doing.'

The man remains upright as another officer speaks to him.

An onlooker hits the officer's hand with what appears to be a wad of paper and says: 'Why you got to taser him man?'

The woman in grey then comes back into frame and is dragged along the floor by her hands.

An officer tries to calm her down by lifting her arm up behind her head. He then lets her go - but she heads back towards the fray.

On onlooker comically states 'oy is my McDonald's ready' as the clip comes to an end.

Another states: 'I only came here for a f****** chicken sandwich.'

Met Police have been approached for comment.
