The Life of Kylie star has reportedly been spending time with ex Travis Scott, 29, when not busy with her brands. 

A source recently told HollywoodLife: 'Kylie and Travis are spending a good amount of time together right now. 

'They have snuck out to dinner without getting photographed on a few occasions at least in the last few weeks alone. They try to be discreet about it because they don’t want all the chatter that follows.'

The insider added: 'They will always have chemistry between them, but they’re not together and are not discussing getting back together. 

'They just have a strong connection and like to spend time together. Neither one of them are looking for more right now.  

It comes after big she and big sister Kim Kardashian, 39, posted a statement earlier this month to Instagram, announcing the end of KUWTK, which has become a cultural phenomenon since premiering in 2007.

Power play: Kim and Kylie reportedly ushered in the end of the show, after they both threatened to leave, forcing 'momager' Kris Jenner's hand

Kim and Kylie reportedly ushered in the end of the show, after they both threatened to leave, forcing 'momager' Kris Jenner's hand.

A source told The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements. She doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.

'Filming the show meant having to be in LA with her family - now is free to fly off on holiday, or follow Travis Scott on his next tour.'

It came after sister Kourtney, 41, left the show back in March, later citing a 'toxic environment' to Vogue Arabia. 

Kylie and Travis have been getting closer during quarantine, which they've spent together with daughter Stormi, two.

The power couple was first romantically linked back in April of 2017, before announcing their separation last September.
