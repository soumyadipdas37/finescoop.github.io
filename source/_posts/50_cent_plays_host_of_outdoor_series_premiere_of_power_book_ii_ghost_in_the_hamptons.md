The stars were out for the special outdoor series premiere of the new Starz series Power Book II: Ghost, which is a spinoff of the long-running series, Power.

And executive producer Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson was on hand to play host of the festivities that was held at a drive-in theater-like setting in the exclusive Hamptons neighborhood in West Mill, New York.

With the COVID-19 pandemic still a major health concern, drivers pulled up their cars in front of a large screen for the airing of the very first episode.
