A murder investigation is underway after a man was stabbed to death in the Liverpool suburb of Dingle this afternoon.

A wide police cordon remains in Prince William Street while forensic investigators continue to make enquiries.

Merseyside Police say officers were called to the scene around 4.30pm after reports a man had sustained a stab wound to the chest.

Police have cordoned off Prince William Street in the residential Liverpool suburb of Dingle after a man, 30, was stabbed in the chest. He was taken to hospital but later died. Merseyside Police have detained a man in his 20s for questioning.

Emergency services attended and the victim, in his 30s, was taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

A spokeswoman for the Force said a man in his 20s was detained and will then be taken for questioning.

The victim's next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Police believe the attack may have been 'targeted' and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward. A cordon remains in place and a full investigation is being pursued.

Officers remain in the area to speak to witnesses and carry out further enquiries, while detectives believe the attack was 'targeted'.

Detective Superintendent Dave McCaughrean said: 'We are appealing for anyone who was in Prince William Street or the surrounding area, and witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious behaviour to please get in touch.

'A man has tragically lost his life and at this stage, we are treating the incident as targeted, however an investigation is now underway to establish the full circumstances.'

An air ambulance helicopter had landed on a patch of grass near the Baltic Market this afternoon, and is believed to have been deployed in relation to the stabbing.
