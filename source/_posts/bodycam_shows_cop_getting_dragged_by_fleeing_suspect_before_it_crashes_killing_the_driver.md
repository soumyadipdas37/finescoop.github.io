A Utah police department has released the bodycam video that shows the moment an officer was dragged by a fleeing suspect's car before it crashed and killed the driver following a traffic stop in July. 

James Franklin, 23, was pulled over by an Ogden officer on July 21 for a seat belt violation. 

During the stop, the officer noticed that the plates on the car did not match the vehicle's registration. 

In the video, James Franklin (pictured) is heard trying to explain why the plates didn't match the registration before the officer asks him to step out of the vehicle

The footage shows that two officers tried to pull Franklin out of the driver’s seat but within a matter of moments, Franklin puts the car into gear and speeds off, dragging one of the officers with him. The officer's hand is seen grabbing onto Franklin's shirt (top right)
