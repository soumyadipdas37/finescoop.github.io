Coronation Street actor Sam Aston's partner, Briony, charted her pregnancy journey with a series of snaps on Instagram on Wednesday.

The new mum - who welcomed baby son Sonny in August - shared a slew of progressive photos of her changing body - from first signs of a bump through to a a post-baby tummy, and then the final product, Sonny himself.

In the first, taken in early April, she remarked that she thought she already 'looked massive'.

She shared another of her doing yoga in a crop-top from the same time.

She explained that her bump changed quickly and she had to adapt her yoga routine as a result.

'Wheel pose was so tricky in pregnancy!' she commented as she performed the position in a backwards arch.

She followed this with a snap at 31 weeks, when the baby had dropped.

Another saw her in her pyjamas trying out her birthing pool in her living room - with no water in it.

'Not realising I wouldn't get the chance to use it again!' she added - having not ended up giving birth in it.

She posted another snap in a black bra and knickers, explaining that she had been 'waddling for four months' by that stage in July.

She rounded this off with a snap of her at 34 weeks, the day before birth, with her 'baby boy en route the next day'.

She shared snaps with Sam and Sonny, the three of them in the hospital following the birth, and another of just the baby.

She also showed off her postpartum shape, writing: 'And then bump was no more!' 

Sonny was born six weeks premature but soap actor Sam, 27, revealed that the birth of their son was 'calm'.

Briony was beaming with happiness as she cradled her firstborn in the adorable snap posted to her social media. 

Sonny was wearing a white onsie and is already rocking a full head of ginger hair, just like his father. 

The mother-of-one displayed her natural beauty as she opted for a makeup-free look and kept her long blonde tresses in a loose ponytail, leaving her fringe to delicately frame her face.

Briony revealed that nothing could have prepared her for the joys of parenthood. 

She said: 'Nothing could have truly prepared me for your entrance into this world; a journey of complete surrender and the most intense surges of energy I have ever felt in my life. 

'But I understand now that it had to be this way. How else could my heart come to live outside of my body?'

Briony penned: 'Nothing could have truly prepared me for your entrance into this world; a journey of complete surrender and the most intense surges of energy I have ever felt in my life'

In August, she confirmed the birth of her son on social media and revealed his official date of birth and weight.

She penned: 'Sonny Aston. He calmly entered our world 6 weeks early on 11.08.20 at 5lbs 7oz and we couldn’t be more in love'. 

The yoga instructor was expecting to welcome her baby in September and had been documenting her journey online.

Briony and Sam first announced they were expecting a boy when speaking with OK! magazine, saying: 'We're having a boy!

'It was a massive surprise when we found out, as there are loads of girls in our families, so we were adamant we were having a girl.'

The couple also revealed they had only been trying for a baby for little over a month before getting the positive result. 

Sam, whose Coronation Street character Chesney is parenting quads on the popular ITV soap, said he and Briony would love a big family but admitted they were glad they were just expecting the one child.
