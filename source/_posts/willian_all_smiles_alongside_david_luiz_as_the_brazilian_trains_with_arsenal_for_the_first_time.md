Willian trained for the first time as an Arsenal player on Friday following his free transfer from Chelsea earlier this summer.

The Brazilian winger was spotted at the Gunners' London Colney training base training with his new team-mates ahead of the new Premier League season which starts next weekend. 

The winger was seen smiling alongside Arsenal defender David Luiz, who he knows very well from his time at Chelsea and the Brazilian national team.

Arsenal have been back in training for a couple of weeks, having played in a couple of pre-season matches including the Community Shield win over Liverpool at Wembley.

However, Willian has only been able to start training now and joins fellow latecomers Alexandre Lacazette, Mesut Ozil and Nicolas Pepe in teaming up with Mikel Arteta's squad. 

Though the player was seen being part of gameplan scenarios in training, implying that the Arsenal coach will be keen to get him involved in competitive action as soon as possible.

Upon completing the deal for Willian, Arteta even hinted that Willian could be used as an attacking midfielder this season, rather than in a wide role he was regularly used in at Chelsea.

The Spaniard told the Arsenal official website: 'We had a clear intention to strengthen in the attacking midfielder and the winger positions [and] he is a player that gives us a lot of versatility, he can play in three or four different positions. 

'He has the experience of everything in the football world but to still have the ambition to come here and contribute to bring the club where it belongs.'

The 32-year-old arrived in north London after rejecting a new two-year deal at Stamford Bridge, with Blues boss Frank Lampard reportedly keen on keeping the Brazilian at the top-four club.

However, the Gunners managed to offer Willian a three-year contract and the player took up the option to join the FA Cup winners, who beat Chelsea 2-1 in last month's final at Wembley.

Willian was Arsenal's first summer signing of the 2020 summer transfer window, with the Gunners adding Brazilian defender Gabriel Magalhaes to their ranks for the forthcoming campaign.  

Arsenal also have a new face in former Saint-Etienne defender William Saliba available this season, after the 19-year-old defender was loaned back to the Ligue 1 club after joining the Gunners for £25million 12 months ago. 

Willian could make his Arsenal debut when the Gunners open their Premier League campaign with a match away at Fulham on September 12.
