Janice Woolford, 68 - who was stabbed to death by her 'very controlling' adult son before he killed himself - had reported 17 previous incidents to the police

A woman who was stabbed to death by her 'very controlling' adult son before he killed himself had reported 17 previous incidents to the police.

Janice Woolford, 68, was found dead at the home she shared with her reclusive alcoholic son Michael, 44, in Tunstall, Sunderland, in February. 

Woolford - who did not have a telephone, bank account, benefits or a job and very rarely left the house - stabbed his mother eight times before taking a fatal overdose of painkillers, the coroner was told. 

The majority of her wounds were to the head and neck. 

An inquest today heard that Mrs Woolford was subject to years of emotional and physical abuse from her son - including one incident where Woolford shot his mother in the face with an air rifle in 2003. 

Their bodies were discovered after Mrs Woolford's colleagues at a local charity raised the alarm, the inquest at Sunderland Civic Centre heard.

Inquiries found that Woolford was 'very controlling' of his mother.

She had been a widow since her only child was 18 months old, ensuring she provided him with exactly what he wanted, and that he considered himself the man of the house.

As well as being emotionally abusive, he also physically harmed her, the hearing was told.

Northumbria Police recorded 17 incidents relating to the property in the past 22 years.

She later told a judge that it was accidental and that proceedings against her son should stop, and family members told police investigating her murder that she continually made excuses for him.

Detective Sergeant Euan Campbell, who led the police inquiry, said the force has since examined what help Mrs Woolford was offered.

He told the hearing: 'We specifically looked back at the 17 incidents.

'We can say it is documented throughout them that Janice has been offered referrals to support agencies a number of times as a result of incidents at the house and was also requested to make statements about what has gone on.

'It is quite clear she would essentially report an incident, and if Michael was arrested it was at this point she would want no further involvement and she would want Michael released.

'She would say she had managed his behaviour since he was five and she didn't need any help.'

The inquest heard that Woolford had attended mainstream school and won a place at university but dropped out and was a reclusive alcoholic.

Assistant Coroner Karin Welch said: 'It seems clear she was a very independent, proud mother but that, effectively, this has ultimately led to her death because she obviously had difficulties with Michael.'  

She said Mrs Woolford's 'mother's instinct' must have made it 'doubly difficult to effectively walk away from the situation'.

The coroner recorded that Mrs Woolford was unlawfully killed and her son's death was suicide.
