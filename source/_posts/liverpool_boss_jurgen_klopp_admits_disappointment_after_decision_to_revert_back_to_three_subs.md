Jurgen Klopp has expressed disappointment that teams will only be able to make three substitutions next season and believes the decision will impact on player welfare.

A vote at a Premier League meeting at the beginning of August led to the rule of five changes — which was introduced for the period after lockdown at the end of the last season — reverting to the standard policy of three.

The International Football Association Board had given leagues the chance to extend to five substitutions for the next 12 months and the Scottish Premiership is one such competition that has accepted the opportunity.

Some Premier League managers — notably Aston Villa’s Dean Smith — were outspoken on the issue, claiming five changes merely favoured those clubs with the biggest squads, but Klopp has argued the point from the physical load that will now be put on footballers.

Asked whether he would have been in favour staying with five changes, Klopp replied: ‘Yes. I know the discussion will go again that it’s an advantage for the bigger clubs. I don’t discuss it from that point of view. I don’t want to have an advantage in the competition.

‘We have 38 Premier League games in a four-weeks shorter season. That says it all. And all the other competitions will be pretty much the same, as far as I know. That means just that these things would help. But I can imagine that other teams see it differently.

‘I saw it last season as well when we played the last nine games — Manchester City could bring on five players — ooh not bad! But it’s never for having an advantage. It’s all about how can we get through this season. Not: “Oh that’s a little advantage here”. 

The German believes making five changes would not give Liverpool an unfair advantage 

‘Getting in a good way through the season for the sake of the football players and the performance levels, I think it would make sense. But I don’t make the decisions.’

Klopp was left with a sense of deja vu after the Community Shield.

The game against Arsenal followed a similar pattern to the fixture against Manchester City 12 months ago, when Liverpool fell behind to an early goal, equalised in the second half but then lost on penalties.

Rhian Brewster, the England Under 21 forward, came on for Gini Wijnaldum in added time and replaced the Dutchman as the fall guy from 12 yards, his shot striking the bar.

Klopp gave the striker, who had scored three goals in Liverpool’s two warm-up friendlies in Austria last week, a sympathetic bearhug as he trudged off.

Liverpool’s manager had predicted on Friday that ‘it wouldn’t be our best performance ever’ and he was proved right. They were a little laboured at times and missed the input of injured trio Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

There was, though, a major positive in the cameo of Takumi Minamino, the Japan forward signed from Red Bull Salzburg in January.

He scored his first goal for the club but it was his energy — and the impression he has made in training — that leads Klopp to believe he will play an important role in future.

‘It was big for him and for us,’ said Klopp, whose side squandered a number of chances to win. ‘The only thing he has lacked with us is that he didn’t score. He was close in plenty of moments but the shape he’s in is good and everyone could see that.  

‘The goal is the logical step after performing at the level he has, especially in pre-season. So I am pleased for him. It was important for us to stay in the game and for him just to make his first important step.

‘He can have an impact. That’s why we signed him. But after one or two good pre-season performances I don’t want to put pressure on him. We have a good team and it’s difficult to get into it.

‘But he’s useful for us. It was not only the goal, it was his play in between. He was really good in short spaces, his first touch is exceptional. His decision-making between the lines was quick. He can be a real player for us.’
