A flock of birds cried fowl in spectacular fashion when a predator swooped in for the kill - forcing them to form the shape of an exclamation mark.

Photographer Nuray Gonulalan was amazed when she looked up and saw the familiar punctuation symbol - often associated with shock or panic - hovering above her.

She grabbed her camera and captured the pack of birds in their striking formation as they desperately attempted to escape in Mogan Lake, Ankara, Turkey.

'Like a cartoon': Photographer Nuray Gonulalan captured a flock of birds who formed an exclamation mark as they were attacked by a predator in Mogan Lake, Ankara, Turkey

Whipped into shape: The flock of birds also formed a tornado-esque shape in the sky

Astounded: Photographer Nuray Gonulalan

Ms Gonulalan said: 'It was an incredible once-in-a-lifetime chance to catch the sign, which is recognised by everyone.

'It was my lucky day, I got plenty of photos of this event. Nature was very generous to me that day.'

Nuray had been patiently laying in wait hoping to photograph a rare bird when she spotted the swooping flock out of the corner of her eye.

But after being distracted by the group's astonishing shape she quickly turned her attentions to the flock which comprised around 5,000 birds.

She said: 'It was almost like they were crying for help - just like you would see in a cartoon.

'There was between 4,000-5,000 Sturnus Vulgaris birds present who define their flying direction by the sun. When the predator moved in, they began making interesting shapes and flying formations in order to avoid it.

'It was an incredible sight - I will never forget it. it was a visual feast that kept changing every second. I could not stop watching until the end.'
