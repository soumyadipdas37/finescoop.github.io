This kind of match on a wearing pitch was exactly what England captain Eoin Morgan had called for on the eve of this series.

These are the kind of conditions they have to get better at combating, particularly as the next World Cup is in India.

If you want evidence that they were not a one-dimensional side during the four-year journey to becoming world champions, then look at last year’s final as an example.

The test against Australia on a wearing pitch was what England and Eoin Morgan needed

It was fairly low scoring at 241 apiece, and they adapted pretty well — although that was a green top of a pitch. 

This was dry, used, slow and low, and reminiscent of the one in the Champions Trophy semi-final loss to Pakistan in 2017. The kind for which they need a plan B in setting totals because their policy of going hard will not work all over the world.

For the batsmen, this was an exercise in reducing expectation and not letting frustration get the better of them if bowlers of the quality of Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins were on top. 

Joe Root was prepared to adapt but will be disappointed with going out in such a soft manner

In such circumstances, you need to give yourself that extra couple of overs to acknowledge: ‘Right, this is hard work.’ To assess what is making it hard, whether it will get easier and when the time has come to up the ante.

Joe Root has one of the lowest dot-ball percentages amongst batsmen in world cricket, averages more than 50 and very rarely lets any bowler settle, but on Sunday he scored just three singles from his first 28 balls — so he was prepared to adapt and allow the bowlers a spell of dominance.

The thing Root would have been disappointed with is that once he used up all those deliveries to get himself into the 30s, he was out in a soft manner. On a flat pitch, a gung-ho dismissal doesn’t matter because Jos Buttler comes in and picks up the mantle. But on a difficult pitch, if Root and Morgan use up 30-40 deliveries, one of them has to bat through to the end — because it is so hard for new batsmen to get started on such surfaces.

As the likes of Adil Rashid demonstrated, England are capable of producing strong finishes

The one saving grace for this England team, however, is the batting power of their lower order and since the 2015 World Cup, their numbers 8-11 have been the most prolific on the world scene. 

As Tom Curran, Adil Rashid and Jofra Archer showed, they are capable of strong finishes, and that means the team doesn’t have to suck it up for as long as their rivals when ball is dominating.

For years, we were asking England if they were a side capable of getting big scores, the 300-pluses? Now we are asking whether they have the players to get to the 260-par scores. It feels like the wheel’s gone full circle. It was good to see them respond to the pressure of scrambling to a winning total.
