In May, the In Your Eyes hitmaker revealed her hotly-anticipated LP - her first since Golden in 2018 - is to feature a set of 'grown-up disco' tracks. 

She said: '[It's] difficult even for me to explain. But even grown-ups need some pure pop fun.' 

Disco is making a comeback with artists like Doja Cat and Dua Lipa channelling the genre on their recent hits Say So and  Don't Start Now respectively. 

She tweeted on Monday: 'I. AM. SO. EXCITED. I can finally announce that my next single is called #MAGIC and it's coming out this Thursday!'

Disco is making a comeback, and Kylie said of the trend: 'It's all cyclical, right? I loved disco. There's a lot of early 2000s love around at the moment. Both feel like good times for me, so I'm channelling that into this record' 

The Spinning Around hitmaker said of the trend: 'It's all cyclical, right? I loved disco. There's a lot of early 2000s love around at the moment. 

'Both feel like good times for me, so I'm channelling that into this record,' she added. 

Kylie famously embraced disco during the early 2000s, where she released such iconic tracks as Spinning Around - and wore her infamous gold short-shorts.  

The Loco-Motion singer has been learning how to engineer and produce her own vocals amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Remember her! The Can't Get You Out of My Head hitmaker teased last year that 'Disco Kylie' was set to return

Kylie has also been working with disco pop producer Mousse T, Italian DJ Alex Gaudino, and Madonna's French producer Mirwais on her new music. 

The Can't Get You Out of My Head hitmaker teased last year that  'Disco Kylie' was set to return.  

She said: 'I feel a bit of disco coming on next. There's actually a big disco section in this show and we all know about it by the end because it nearly takes us all out. It's full-on, full-tilt, so that's where I would go at this point'. 

Disco is set to be released on November 6.
