Hilaria Baldwin already looks much smaller just one day after welcoming her fifth child, a son, with husband Alec Baldwin.

The 36-year-old yoga instructor showed off her new shape while in a black bra and undies with her hospital ID bracelet still on in an Instagram post shared on Thursday afternoon.

Next to the new image was the star's very pregnant shape before she gave birth.

 In the pregnant photo, she has on maroon lace lingerie as she puts on hand on her tummy and the other hand on her cell phone as she posed in profile in her bathroom.

The next photo was taken in the hospital as Hilaria had on a black lace bra and matching undies.

Her stomach pops out but instead of looking one day away from giving birth, she looks perhaps several weeks away from it.

'A day and a half...and a baby later,' the TV personality wrote in her caption for her nearly 800K followers.

'On the way to the hospital and about to make my way home. Thank you body for all that you have done and all that you continue to do. '

The New York City resident then added: 'I am grateful for this journey, housing and growing my son, delivering him safely, and to feel ready for me to return to me...step by step, taking a path of patience, nurturing, and time.'

Baldwin then noted she blurred her hospital tags 'because felt like I should.'

Tori Spelling hit the like button and said, 'Congratulations beautiful mom warrior and to papa and kiddos too!' Like Hilaria, she has five kids: daughters Stella, 12, Hattie, eight, and sons Liam, 13, Finn, seven, and Beau, three.

Rosie O'Donnell added a heart and said, 'Congratulations.'

Fans had positive feedblack with one woman saying, 'You are such an inspiration to so many women! I love how you thanked your body! You are so present and mindful. Enjoy your new son!' and another adding 'Can’t wait to hear his name!!! Great job Mama!!'

This comes just after she was seen dressing her little boy, whose name has not yet been shared, for their trip home to meet his four siblings.

The Spanish-born beauty and the 62-year-old Hunt For Red October actor already have daughter Carmen, seven, and sons Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two.

The child is seen in a blue and white striped snap-up onesie with a pink and white cotton cap on as he lays on a hospital bed with white sheets and a blanket.

Hilaria is dressed for comfort in a black sweatoutfit as her dark hair is pulled back in a clip and she has no makeup on. The Extra correspondent wears a simple wedding band on her ring finger. 

Alec, who got a tattoo of a foot on his arm that he flashed earlier in the day, is not seen.

'He is perfect': On Wednesday she announced the arrival of a baby boy via social media, sharing a sweet snap of her family's latest addition 

Hilaria explained she had to change the infant's clothing because he had an accident early on.

Alec showed off a footprint of his youngest child ink stamped on his arm 

'He peed on his first going home outfit,' she said in her caption. 'So we changed.' 

The star explained on Instagram Stories that her children already met the newborn on Facetime.

Son Romeo asked where the baby was, Carmen is 'obsessed' with the child and was talking possible names for her youngest brother.

Earlier on Wednesday, Hilaria, 36, had announced the arrival of baby number five for the couple via social media. 

Alec is also a father to daughter Ireland, 24, whom he shares with ex-wife Kim Basinger. 

'We had a baby last night. He is perfect and we couldn’t be happier. Stay tuned for a name,' Hilaria wrote alongside a snap showing her holding the newborn as she sat in her hospital bed with Alec by her side. 

Second wife: Alec and Hilaria, pictured in 2018, wed in 2012. The actor was previously wed to Hollywood star Kim Basinger from 1993 to 2002

This comes after Hilaria had a false labor alarm in late August.

She posted a selfie to her Instagram Story and explained: 'I've had a million kids but drove 3 hours to the dr today because I thought maybe I was in labor. You'd think I'd know by now.'

Hilaria went on: 'With living so far from the hospital due to COVID, I'm trying to anticipate labor even sooner.'

Baby news: The couple announced they were expecting again in April. In 2019, Hilaria suffered two miscarriages as she tried to add to their family in a quest for a second daughter; seen with two of their kids in 2017

She added: 'Literally was there for 10 min and had to drive 3 hours back home because I was not in labor. I'm wiped.'

She added the graphics 'Road Trip' and 'Baby On Board'.

In 2019, Hilaria suffered two miscarriages as she tried to add to her family, both of which she candidly documented on social media in an attempt to normalize them for other women.  

She and her Blue Jasmine actor husband wanted another daughter to their family after welcoming three boys and have publicly said they will continue trying until that happens.
