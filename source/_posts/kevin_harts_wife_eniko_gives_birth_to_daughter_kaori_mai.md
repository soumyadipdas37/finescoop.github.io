Kevin Hart's model wife Eniko has given birth.

Eniko, 36, announced the arrival of daughter Kaori Mai on Instagram on Wednesday and called her 'a little bit of heaven sent to earth.' 

Little Kaori was born the day before the post and Eniko wrote: 'thankful • grateful • blessed a little bit of heaven sent down to earth.

Kevin Hart's wife Eniko has given birth: The couple announced the arrival of daughter Kaori Mai on Instagram on Wednesday and call her 'a little bit of heaven sent to earth' 

 

Welcome to the world: Eniko shared this post on Instagram a day after her daughter was born

'Welcome to the world baby girl.. we couldn’t love you more.. ✨Kaori Mai Hart✨ 9.29.20.'

Eniko and Kevin, 41, have been married for four years and have son Kenzo Kash, two, who revealed 'Baby K's' gender on Mother's Day.

The comedian has been married previously, sharing two children, daughter Heaven and, 15, son Hendrix, 12, with his ex-wife of eight years Torrei Hart. 

Her last pregnancy workout: Eniko was last pictured working out at 40-weeks seven days before as she prepared to welcome her baby 

Eniko was last pictured working out at 40-weeks as she worked up a full-body sweat in a grey sports bra and form-fitting leggings the week before. 

'Just a little morning motivation,' the Fabletics ambassador had written on her Instagram Story, as she shared footage of herself squatting low and lifting weights, calling it the 'last workout of her pregnancy.'

Throughout her second pregnancy Eniko has also kept regularly active, switching up gym days with water aerobics and even bike-riding as she sees fit. 

The couple announced they were expecting back in March and two months later, they revealed they were having a little girl, alongside a sweet family picture.  

Kevin wrote at the time: 'We are thrilled about the arrival of our baby girl....Family of 6 WOOOOOOOOW!!!!'

He continued: 'God is unbelievable....We are blessed to have you in our lives. All I can say is thank you honey.'

Kevin and Eniko had posed with, Kenzo, Heaven, and Hendrix for a gender reveal themed photoshoot taken in the backyard of their Los Angeles home. 

The TV star, of course, wished his 'beautiful' wife of nearly four-years a 'Happy Mother's Day' in the post's caption. 

Eniko had some words on her own that she shared on her Instagram page shortly after Kevin's post.  

'OH BABY, it’s a little lady,' began the brunette beauty. 'This Mother’s Day God has blessed us with another baby girl!'

She admitted that 'this pregnancy felt the exact same ' as when she was pregnant with son Kenzo, so she 'could’ve sworn [they] were having another boy.'

'I literally screamed, laughed, and cried when we found out this time around because she & Kenzo are what I’ve always prayed for!'

Eniko described the entire situation as a 'dream come true' and confirmed that the family are 'filled with so much JOY' over the baby's gender.

It's a girl: Kevin surprised fans on Instagram by revealing that him and wife Eniko will be welcoming a daughter to join their family back in May 

She also made reference to Kenzo's facial expression, which looked to be the exact opposite of the 'joy' she had described.

'Dreams really do come true, and we are filled with so much JOY! (Can’t you tell, look at Zo),' wrote Eniko.

'Our little family is growing and starting to finally feel complete. Soon enough the little ones will be running and bossing us all around. Lol! She is already loved in so many ways..and we’re so anxious to meet her,' she concluded.

Kevin recently revealed he had been annoying his wife by constantly taking photos to document her pregnancy because he had nothing else to do while quarantining due to the coronavirus pandemic.

He said in July: 'During these last few months, I am waiting for the moments that aren't the most photogenic, trying to catch her biting a big sandwich, you know, falling asleep.

'Just the moments of pregnancy that are really beautiful. I am going to focus on those. Because we're in the house, I don't have nothing else to do.'

Although his wife said she had been grateful for having him there with her through every stage of her pregnancy this time, because of the pandemic, she had said her partner had been getting on her nerves. 

Kevin  admitted recently: 'She's so happy at the fact that through these stages, I'm here. Like normally, I'm in and out.

'So it's been a real blessing just to be around and talk, converse, you know, and just kind of be with the fam through these months.'

He continued: 'So this is the first time that I've ever been here this much through a pregnancy in general in my life. So it's been refreshing. She's not getting on my nerves.

'But she's saying I'm getting on her nerves. And you know, whatever. I don't fight it. But apparently, I'm annoying.' 

Pregnancy Announcement: Like their gender reveal, Eniko used Instagram to announce to the world that she was pregnant with her second child on March 24
