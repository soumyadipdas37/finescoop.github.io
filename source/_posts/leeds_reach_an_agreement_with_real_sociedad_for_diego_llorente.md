Leeds United have agreed an agreement in principle for the transfer of Diego Llorente from Real Sociedad.

The Spanish club tweeted out the announcement, as well as a farewell video showing off some of the defender's highlights.    

The exact specifics have not yet been revealed, but earlier on Tuesday, Leeds were thought to be closing in on a deal worth up to £20million. 

Defender Diego Llorente is on the brink of joining Leeds from Real Sociedad for £20million 

It remains to be seen whether Marcelo Bielsa will use Llorente as cover or a starter

Llorente will be the second Spain international to join in the window with the club having already secured Rodrigo from Valencia.

Llorente, capped five times by his country, has not always convinced regarding his consistency but Leeds hope his experience can help their young squad.

Robin Koch and Liam Cooper are Marcelo Bielsa's first-choice centre-back pairing so it will be interesting to see where Llorente fits in.

Llorente has plenty of experience and has been capped by Spain on five occasions 

Llorente spent the early part of his career at Real Madrid, but only made three appearances for the first team. 

Instead he often played in youth squads or out on loan at Rayo Vallecano and Malaga.

He joined Real Sociedad in 2017, and has since made 88 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals in that time.
