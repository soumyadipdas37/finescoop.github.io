Land Rover has brought a breath of fresh air to its refreshed compact 4X4 range with the help of a new cabin purification system to help keep drivers and passengers more healthy on the road.

It is one of a host of technical, infotainment and engine upgrades for its fleet of Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport vehicles ahead of the key new '70-plate' change from 1 September.

To boost occupants' 'wellbeing', buyers now have for the first time the option of a new cabin air filtration system which filters out fine particulate matter including allergens, pollen and even strong smells often found in cities and high traffic areas. The driver can even check the levels on the touchscreen to keep the cabin clean and healthy.

Costing £279 as an option on the Discovery Sport and £335 on the Range Rover Evoque, it complements the existing cabin air ionisation technology that was introduced in 2019.

Land Rover said: 'These technologies filter out fine particulates – often found in polluted cities – and purify and recirculate air within the cabin in order to ensure the air customers breathe inside the vehicle is purer and cleaner than the air outside.'

By pressing the 'Purify' button within the vehicle touchscreen, the system reduces the number of cabin allergens and fine particulates down to below 2.5 microns in size.

The purify mode can also be activated automatically, said Land Rover: 'When the sensors detect an increase in harmful allergens or particulates, the system will turn on automatically and begin to purify the cabin.'

The driver can view the effect of the system via a simple colour scale on the touchscreen highlighting the relative indoor and outdoor air quality.

The purify mode can also be activated automatically so drivers and passengers can enjoy the benefits of pollutant-free air inside, said Land Rover

The advanced cabin air filtration system also incorporates an active carbon filter to remove unpleasant odours.

The system works alongside the existing cabin air ionisation system which condenses moisture from cabin air, breaking it into tiny electrically charged particles that react with air contaminants to neutralise odours, bacteria and allergens.

Land Rover explains: 'Shielded by water, the particles last longer and disperse further than those from conventional ionisers, helping to maintain a healthier cabin atmosphere for longer.'

They new air purifying system is available in the recently revamped Land Rover Discover Sport, but as a £279 optional extra 

The revamped Discovery Sport is available from £31,915. 

It gains a range of cleaner and more efficient new 2.0-litre Ingenium diesel engines using electrified 48-volt mild hybrid technology (163 and 204 horsepower) with CO2 emissions from 163g/km, joining a plug-in hybrid launched earlier this year. 

The line-up also includes a new 290 horsepower petrol Ingenium engine promising 'enhanced performance and refinement' to the new Discovery Sport Black model which accelerates from rest to 60mph in seven seconds.

A new R-Dynamic Plus costs from £38,605 with privacy glass, 20-inch wheels, and powered tail-gate.

Land Rover's most advanced infotainment system, Pivi and Pivi Pro, is now available for the Range Rover Evoque, which also promises greater connectivity to online media services including Spotify, Bluetooth connectivity for two phones at once, wireless charging with signal-boosting option, and downloadable 'software-over-the-air' to keep the vehicle's software systems up to date. It also has a 3D Surround Camera and new rear collision monitors.

Buyers of the new Range Rover Evoque can have the new air purifying system fitted too, but at a premium of £335

The revamped Range Rover Evoque is priced from £32,100 in a line up joined by two new 2.0-litre four-cylinder Ingenium diesel engine variants (165 and 200 horse-power) using 48-volt mild-hybrid technology, and now topped by a new Range Rover Evoque Autobiography flagship model priced from £52,110 (D200) to £55,580 (P300). 

As well as the new cabin air filtration system, it also features a series of upgrades similar to the Discovery Sport.
