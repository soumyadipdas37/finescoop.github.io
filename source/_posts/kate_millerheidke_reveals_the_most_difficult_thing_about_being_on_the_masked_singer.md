The Queen was finally unveiled as Kate Miller-Heidke during the The Masked Singer's grand finale on Monday.

And now, the 38-year-old singer has revealed what was the hardest thing about appearing on the show.

Uploading a series of photos to her Instagram, Kate explained the most challenging part of gig was having to self-isolate for 14 days and not being able to communicate with her son.

Bow down, peasants! On Tuesday, Kate Miller-Heidke (pictured) revealed what she found to be the most difficult thing about being the Queen on The Masked Singer... and it wasn't keeping her identity a secret 

'Ernie is only 4 and he didn't really understand why I couldn't come downstairs, though he tried,' the mother-of-one revealed.

'He would come below my window and yell 'Rapunzel!' whenever he wanted to have a chat, and sometimes we ate together with him at a little table on the ground.'

Production on The Masked Singer was forced to temporarily suspend after dancers and crew tested positive for coronavirus last month.

Kate, host Osher Günsberg and judges Dannii Minogue and Jackie 'O' Henderson, and 200 workers were all ordered into self-isolation.

'I'm lucky I had somewhere to isolate at home, and that I didn't get the virus.

'I was so relieved that all 17 cases had completely recovered by the time we filmed the finale two weeks later. What a time!' she concluded.

'I tend towards Hypochondria at the best of times, so was on constant alert for symptoms to appear,' she said.

The singer added that she would also regularly test her sense of smell with things in the bathroom or the fruit bowl and admits she couldn't sleep very well.

Kate placed runner-up to former Neighbours star Bonnie Anderson, who won the Channel 10 singing competition as Bushranger.
