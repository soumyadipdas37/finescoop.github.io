Now that family and close friends are allowed in the NBA's Florida-based bubble, model Winnie Harlow wasted no time flying to see her beau Kyle Kuzma.

The 26-year-old Jamaican-Canadian beauty touched down at the Happiest Place on Earth on Monday after making sure last week that she was negative for the coronavirus.

Winnie and Kyle, who plays forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, have been dating since May and have been separated since the NBA restarted its 2020 season in Disney World. 

Reunion: Now that family and close friends are allowed in the NBA's Florida-based bubble, model Winnie Harlow wasted no time flying to see her beau Kyle Kuzma and touched down in Orlando on Monday

Winnie traveled in style and flew on a swanky private jet to the NBA bubble in Orlando, Florida.

She documented her journey on social media, with the leggy beauty popping an exploding bottle of Veuve Clicquot Champagne mid-flight.

The stunner kept things casual but chic in a matching white sweatsuit with pink airbrushed designs.

Her hair was expertly styled in long locks and pulled into a half updo with face framing tendrils.

Whoops: She documented her journey on social media, with the leggy beauty popping an exploding bottle of Veuve Clicquot Champagne mid-flight

Despite a long flight, Winnie looked fresh and glam when she arrived in Florida with shimmering silver eye shadow and long lashes.

On her Instagram Stories, the catwalker shared the breathtaking view from her hotel suite at Disney's Coronado Springs Resort.

Winnie is staying with her boyfriend who has been put up in the resort's Gran Destino Tower along with the rest of his team.

The Tower is not only home to the Lakers but the Los Angeles Clippers, the Miami Heat, the Milwaukee Bucks, the Toronto Raptors and the Boston Celtics.

Finally: Earlier this month ESPN revealed that family and 'established longstanding personal friends' would be allowed admittance into the bubble for the second round of playoffs

Staying safe: Now that she is living within the bubble, Winnie will be subject to daily coronavirus testing

Now that she is living within the bubble, Winnie will be subject to daily coronavirus testing.

She shared a snap of a sign on one of the NBA shuttles that read 'I've been tested daily!' and she commented below 'Lord, when I say daily ...'

To prepare for her visit, Winnie shared footage of her own COVID-19 nasal swab on social media.

'Testing 1 2 3,' she captioned the post. 'It was easy.' 

Love birds: Winnie, who shot to fame on America's Next Top Model, and Kuzma appear to have fallen hard for each other in the short time they've been together

Earlier this month ESPN revealed that family and 'established longstanding personal friends' would be allowed admittance into the bubble for the second round of playoffs. 

Winnie, who shot to fame on America's Next Top Model, and Kuzma appear to have fallen hard for each other in the short time they've been together.

Connecting romantically in May, the pair had been spotted out together during quarantine and Harlow shared a gushing, PDA filled post for Kuzman's 25th birthday this summer.

While apart, the pair had been keeping up with one another via FaceTime. 

Making it work! While they were separated due to Kyle being in the NBA bubble to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, the couple spent a lot of time on FaceTime
