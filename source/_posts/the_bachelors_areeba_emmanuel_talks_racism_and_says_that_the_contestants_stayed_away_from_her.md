Areeba Emmanuel has spoken about racism and diversity in The Bachelor mansion, after she was given the boot by Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert this week. 

The 25-year-old, who is the first Pakistani woman to star on the reality series, claimed that some of her fellow co-stars 'stayed away' from her during her time on the Channel Ten dating show.    

Addressing the issue in an interview with news.com, the beauty said 'actions speak louder than words'.

'Stayed away': Areeba Emmanuel has spoken about racism and diversity in The Bachelor mansion, after she was given the boot by Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert this week. The 25-year-old, who is the first Pakistani woman to star on the reality series, claimed that some of her fellow co-stars 'stayed away' from her during her time on the Channel Ten dating show 

'Actions speak louder than words. It doesn’t always have to be said, and it wasn’t said,' Areeba told the publication. 

'There was no "I don’t like you because of the colour of your hair or the colour of your skin". They’re not trying to be … but they really stayed away from me after that first night.' 

Areeba was referring to her clash with redhead Zoe-Clare McDonald, who claimed she was being discriminated against for the colour of her hair.   

'There was no "I don’t like you because of the colour of your hair or the colour of your skin". They’re not trying to be … but they really stayed away from me after that first night.' Areeba was referring to her clash with redhead Zoe-Clare McDonald, who claimed she was being discriminated against for the colour of her hair 

During The Bachelor premiere, which aired on August 12, Zoe-Clare had a meltdown after Areeba interrupted her chat with Locky Gilbert.

Zoe-Clare claimed she was being 'oppressed' because of her hair colour.

'I'm the only redhead in the whole entire house... The only colours are blonde or brunette, and then there's me. I think that's exactly why Areeba is targeting me. It's the red hair. It's just... it's not appropriate,' she said.

Her rant left viewers baffled as nobody had mentioned the colour of her hair during the show.

Meanwhile, Areeba said she no hard feelings towards the women, saying that she has a 'strong personality'. 

'They never really treated me bad. I was treated how I expected, really,' she added. 

'My personality is very strong and not many people like that so they just stay away because maybe they’re scared.' 

Fuming: On Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor, Locky felt the wrath of Areeba after he sent the feisty reality star packing

On Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor, Locky felt the wrath of Areeba after he sent the feisty reality star packing.

After being eliminated along with four other contestants, Areeba fumed that this year's Bachelor clearly had a penchant for 'basic girls'.

'This is definitely the first time I have ever been rejected by a guy. I don't care because he obviously likes basic girls, and that's not me. I ain't basic,' she pouted.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel Ten.
