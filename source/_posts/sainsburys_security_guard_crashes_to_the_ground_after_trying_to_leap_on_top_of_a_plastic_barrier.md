A Sainsbury's security guard had a painfully boring day at work recently - so much so that he decided to jump a barrier.

However, he fails to make the jump and ends up toppling backwards onto his head in what looks like an excruciatingly painful fall. 

His attempt was caught on video and has been watched almost 400k times on Twitter with users scoring his jump skills and 'aspiration'.

The video shows the security man outside a Sainsbury's story wearing his full uniform. 

He readies himself before he makes the jump, eyeing up the height of the plastic orange barrier. 

With a huge athletic effort, he leaps on top of the barrier but his feet slip and he loses his balance. 

He  flips backwards, in a 360 turn, landing painfully on his head.

One Twitter user jokingly gave the jump a score out of ten, writing: '8/10 on jump height but 0 on the landing.'

Ruth Topham on Twitter, credited the security man's efforts to scale the barrier, writing: '10 out of 10 for aspiration.' 

However, Tom Pine was more concerned for the plastic barrier involved, joking: 'I hope the barrier is ok.'
