Then one by one she dropped her boys 30ft from an open window on an enclosed balcony into the blanket stretched out by locals.

'I woke and one of my kids was next to me,' she said.

'I took his hand and began to look for my second son.

'The three of us fought through the smoke to the balcony, and I don't remember any further from there - I passed out.'

She came round again and pleaded for help, she said.

'I shouted for at least the children to be saved,' she said.

'The children were my only priority.

Three other adults also escaped from the same flat, said the Russian emergencies ministry.

'The window was blown out, everything that could burn, burned down,' she said.

'It's good that we ourselves did not suffer, we only choked on smoke.'

An investigation is underway into how the blaze occurred.

A report by NGS citing emergency sources said it is suspected a child had been playing with a lighter.

There was also a report that a faulty microwave caused the inferno.
