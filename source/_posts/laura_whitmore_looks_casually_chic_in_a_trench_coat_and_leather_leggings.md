She matched her stylish coat with skinny black leather leggings and black high heeled suede boots. 

The Irish beauty showcased her natural beauty with minimal makeup and her flaxen tresses hanging loosely down in waves. 

Laura fiddled around on her mobile as she strolled along the pavement with the hint of a smile on her face. 

At one point, she was seen to rummaged through her leopard-print bag to reveal a patterned face mask, white Apple headphones, and a copy of Sunday Times journalist Dolly Alderton's forthcoming novel Ghosts.

Laura has recently begun filming for Celebrity Juice, as she and new captain Emily Atack look to begin their stint on the programme alongside host Keith Lemon.   

Laura and the actress, 30, took to their social media to share snaps from a picturesque farm where they were shooting scenes with Keith for the programme's next season.

Holly Willoughby, who the pair replaced on the show, also gave her stamp of approval as she shared a snap of the trio and wrote 'Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!'

The trio kept a tight lip on exactly what they were filming, but appeared to be having a great time as the trio smiled for photos together.

One snap saw Emily, Laura and Keith pose for a fun selfie on the farmland, as Laura put on an animated display by flexing her muscles.

ITV2's comedy panel series will see comedian Keith return to host eight episodes this autumn, followed by two 60-minute specials.
