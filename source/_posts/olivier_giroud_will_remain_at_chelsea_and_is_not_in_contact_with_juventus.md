Olivier Giroud will reportedly stay at Chelsea this summer despite transfer interest from Maurizio Sarri's Juventus. 

The Serie A champions had turned their attention to Giroud after struggling to reach an agreement for Barcelona's Luis Suarez and Roma's Edin Dzeko, but The Athletic claim the Frenchman has not entered talks to leave Stamford Bridge. 

Sarri is looking to reinforce his attacking options after the Old Lady released Gonzalo Higuain on Thursday anda move to bring Everton's Moise Kean back to Turin has been considered.

Juventus are interested in signing Oliver Giroud, but the forward plans to stay at Chelsea

The 33-year-old trained at Cobham on Thursday ahead of the season opener at Brighton

Appearances: 88

Goals: 28

Assists: 14

Trophies: 2 (FA Cup + Europa League)

Giroud has also been identified as a potential target but no formal offer has been made by the Italian club.  

The 33-year-old signed an extension to his Blues contract in May which will cover the entirety of the 2020-21 season, however this has not deterred interested clubs. 

The forward was left out of Frank Lampard's squad over the first half of the 2019-20 campaign and attracted interest from Tottenham, Inter Milan and Lazio. 

Once Giroud was reintroduced in February, he scored eight goals in 13 games for Chelsea and this week netted his 40th international goal during France's 4-2 victory over Croatia in the Nations League. 

He maintains he is determined to fight for his spot in Lampard's starting XI after the £53million arrival of Timo Werner from RB Leipzig.

Giroud told Telefoot: 'I haven't spoken to Lampard.

'One thing is certain: the competition will pull us all to the top. A great club should have different options in each position.

'We want to be in the race for the title and I'm here. I finished the season well and I proved to the manager that he can count on me.

'Werner is not the same profile as me, I hope to have some playing time.'
