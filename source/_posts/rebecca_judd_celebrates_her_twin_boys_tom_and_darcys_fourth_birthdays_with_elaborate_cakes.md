She's the busy mother-of-four known for her glamorous lifestyle.

And on Wednesday, Rebecca Judd, 36, pulled out all the stops to mark her twin boys Tom and Darcy turning four.

The TV presenter celebrated the occasion with two custom-made cakes and shared photos of the elaborate designs to Instagram.
