An obstetrician has given the term 'family doctor' a whole new meaning after delivering a newborn baby 29 years after he delivered the child's mother and father. 

Dr. James Stands, an OB/GYN at Lexington Medical Center in West Columbia, South Carolina, delivered Jenna and Max Hazen's newborn son, Elliott, on September 2, nearly three decades after he welcomed them into the world. 

'I thought it was something cool that he was going to be able to deliver all three of us,' the mother-of-two told Good Morning America. 'I knew it was unique, but [also] an interesting story to tell my little boy.'

All smiles: Dr. James Stands, an OB/GYN at Lexington Medical Center in West Columbia, South Carolina, delivered Jenna and Max Hazen's newborn son, Elliott, on September 2

Happy day: The healthy baby boy weighed 9 pounds, 2 ounces, and he was 21 inches long when he arrived earlier this month

Family doctor: Dr. Stands delivered Jenna on January 14, 1991, and he delivered her now-husband Max on August 9 that same year

Dr. Stands history with the family begins with Jenna, whom he delivered on January 14, 1991. That same year, he delivered her now-husband Max on August 9. 

Jenna has been a patient of the OB/GYN since 2013, though he did not deliver her eldest son Hampton. 

She and her mother-in-law were the ones who realized that Dr. Stands had delivered both her and her husband.   

Lexington Medical Center confirmed to GMA that the doctor had delivered Jenna, Max, and newborn Elliott.  

History: Jenna said it's 'an interesting story' to tell her baby boy when he gets older

Brothers: Jenna has been a patient of the OB/GYN since 2013, though he did not deliver her eldest son Hampton 

Aww! The proud parents have shared numerous photos of Elliott with his big brother 

The healthy baby boy weighed 9 pounds, 2 ounces, and he was 21 inches long when he arrived earlier this month. 

Jenna couldn't help but gush about Dr. Stands, recalling how he prayed with her after she suffered a miscarriage prior to Elliott.  

He’s phenomenal,' she said. 'He made everything so relaxing…he's just an awesome doctor.'

The proud parents have since taken their baby boy home, and they have shared numerous photos of Elliott both by himself and with his doting big brother.
