Prospective new Arsenal signing Runar Alex Runarsson may have some explaining to do after tweets surfaced in which he branded Arsene Wenger a 'French f***'.

The 25-year-old Iceland international goalkeeper, who plays for French club Dijon, is attracting interest from the Gunners as they search for a replacement for Aston Villa-bound Emiliano Martinez.

Dijon have set a price tag of just £1.5million for Runarsson, who was an unused substitute when Iceland lost to England in the UEFA Nations League earlier this month.

Old tweets have emerged in which Arsenal transfer target Runar Alex Runarsson brands their former manager Arsene Wenger a 'French f***'

Iceland international Runarsson, then 16, was certainly angry with Wenger and Arsenal

But eagle-eyed Arsenal fans have dug up tweets Runarsson posted nine years ago as a 16-year-old - since deleted - in which he strongly criticises former Arsenal boss Wenger.

The first tweet, from April 21 that year and originally written in Icelandic, says: 'Hell, this Wenger guy is stupid.'

That comes the day after a north London derby at Tottenham in which Arsenal led 3-1 only to end up drawing 3-3. 

Another, posted on June 15, 2011, reads: 'Arsene Wenger is a little too stupid #frenchf***.' 

A third post, from August 21 that year, reads: 'Arsene Wenger is definitely the dumbest man on this planet #frenchf***.'

It isn't clear what annoyed the teenage Runarsson in the June post but by the time of his August follow up, Arsenal had sold Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona.

Runarsson posted at least three tweets criticising Wenger, with the first coming in April 2011

Wenger was once again the subject of Runarsson's anger after an August defeat to Liverpool

They'd also lost 2-0 at home to Arsenal in their second Premier League match of the season, with both goals coming after Emmanuel Frimpong was shown a second yellow card.

Things would go from bad to worse for the Gunners later that week, with Samir Nasri sold to Manchester City and the team demolished 8-2 by Manchester United at Old Trafford.

Runarsson ensured the old tweets were deleted as soon as Arsenal fans brought them to light but that didn't stop some suggesting he shouldn't be signed.

Arsenal have also considered Brentford keeper David Raya, valued at £10million, as Mikel Arteta looks to bring in a back-up to No 1 Bernd Leno.

Runarsson has been lined up as a potential replacement for Aston Villa-bound Martinez

The Gunners are looking for a new understudy for their No 1 goalkeeper Bernd Leno 

Leno kept a clean sheet as Arsenal secured a comfortable 3-0 victory over Fulham on the opening day of the new Premier League season at the weekend.

Martinez, who starred in the Gunners' recent FA Cup and Community Shield triumphs, was not included in Saturday's squad as he edges closer to a switch to Villa.

Arsenal are on the brink of reaching a £20m agreement to see Martinez make the move to Villa Park to be their first-choice stopper.

The Gunners need to bring in a new face before the transfer window closes on October 5.
