Cardi B has 'not shed one tear' after filing for divorce from her husband-of-three-years Offset.

The rapper, 27, recently began divorce proceedings, but has insisted she is not upset about the break-up.

Speaking in an Instagram Live video, she said: 'I want to say thank you so much. However, like, I don't really need it. I'm okay. I want to let you know I have not shed not one tear.'

Although Offset, 28, who has two-year-old daughter Kulture with Cardi, reportedly cheated in the past, Cardi insisted this split was not caused by him being unfaithful.

She said: 'This time, I wasn't crying. Wanna know why? The reason my divorce is not because of none of that s*** that ever happened before. It's not because the cheating. I'm seeing people [saying] "Oh, he has a baby on the way." That's a whole f*** complete lie.'

The WAP star went on to reveal she and Offset called time on their relationship because they were constantly arguing.

She said: 'I just got tired of f***ing arguing. I got tired of not seeing things eye to eye. When you feel like it's not the same anymore, before you actually get cheated on, I rather just be… you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm tired of people.'

The marriage breakdown came after Offset and Cardi briefly split in 2018 before confirming speculation they had rekindled their romance when they attended the 2019 Grammy Awards together.

At the time, the I Like It rapper accused the Migos star of being unfaithful, but they were said to be trying to work things out for the sake of their daughter.

Offset made a number of public gestures to get Cardi back, including crashing her set at Rolling Loud festival in LA with a huge 'Take Me Back Cardi' sign made out of white and red roses.

Although she initially rejected his apology, he still thought it was the right thing to do.

He tweeted at the time: 'All of my wrongs have been made public, i figure it's only right that my apologies are made public too. A ***** was just trying .....thank god I ain't got no balloons sheeesh (sic)'.
