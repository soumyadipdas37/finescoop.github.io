Aston Villa have announced the signing of goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez from Arsenal for £16million.

The Argentine has signed a four-year deal with the Villians after spending eight seasons in North London. 

Martinez was signed to the Gunners since 2012 and has had six different loan spells whilst at the club. He most notably featured for Arsenal in the latter stages of the 2019-20 season and played in their FA Cup final victory over Chelsea.

Manager Dean Smith told the club website: 'We are really pleased with the signing of our new goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.

'We know how highly Arsenal rated him and we watched his outstanding performances last season in a trophy-winning top side.

'We moved for Emi when we saw the opportunity, as it is rare to be able to buy a top class goalkeeper who hasn't yet reached their peak age and who can therefore be a key player for our Club for the long term.'

The signing of Martinez has followed some huge developments from Villa Park the day before as Jack Grealish signed a new five-year deal worth about £135,000 per week to give Aston Villa a huge boost for the new season.

The Villa captain was admired by Manchester United but has now accepted a huge pay rise – an increase of about £55,000 per week on his previous salary – with his current club.

Villa had no interest in discussing a deal for their homegrown star at anything below £80million – a fee only a handful of clubs could contemplate after the coronavirus pandemic reshaped the financial landscape of football.
