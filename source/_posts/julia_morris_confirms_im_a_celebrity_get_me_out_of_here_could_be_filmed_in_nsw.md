Filming for the Australian version of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! usually takes place in South Africa in early January, but that could change in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Host Julia Morris told The Kyle and Jackie 'O' Show on Wednesday while the show is confirmed to take place next year, the location is yet to be decided. 

'Nothing has been confirmed yet, we have literally been waiting for September for the federal government to work out what we're allowed to do,' she began.

'I've gotta say that would be my my dream come true [to film the show locally in NSW] this year with all the traveling,' she continued.

Julia said with the future of international and domestic travel up in the air, producers are yet to make a decision on the location.

'Are we even allowed to go up to our beloved Africa? You know, if there was any time when... somewhere needed our production dollars, it's now in South Africa.'

'We're definitely doing the show for 2021. We just don't really know where yet. So it's wonderful to know that that set is a up our sleeve.' 

Earlier this week, it was revealed the series is likely to be filmed in Murwillumbah, in northern New South Wales, at a campsite normally used for the UK series. 

The campsite is less than an hour from the Gold Coast.

The UK version of the show, which has been filmed in Australia for almost two decades, has also been forced to reconsider its location due to the pandemic.

Back in May, ViacomCBS executive Beverley McGarvey confirmed the show would 'definitely be back next year' and that a potential change of format was on the cards.  

At the time, Ms McGarvey explained I'm A Celebrity... could 'absolutely' be filmed Down Under.  

'The jungle is kind of a character in the show, but we just don't know if that's possible or realistic, so we're just looking at a range of options,' she told news.com.au.
