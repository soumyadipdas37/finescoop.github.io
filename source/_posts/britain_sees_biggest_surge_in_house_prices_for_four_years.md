House prices grew at their fastest rate in four years last month as families sought more space after being cooped up during lockdown.

They are increasing in 'virtually all parts of the UK', said a closely-watched poll of chartered surveyors, with buyers also rushing to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday.

The average home was worth £245,747 in August, £12,000 more than in the same month last year. It was the biggest annual rise since 2016. 

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors poll found buyers are most attracted by gardens or proximity to green space, with eight in ten surveyors saying demand for homes with these attributes will rise in the next two years.

It backs up reports of a surge in enquiries from homeowners wanting more space.

Stamp duty has been temporarily axed on homes worth up to £500,000. 

Recent reports by two of the biggest mortgage lenders Halifax and Nationwide have also revealed a dramatic recovery in the property market as the lockdown has eased, with house prices hitting a record high.

They have both pointed to the impact of chancellor Rishi Sunak's stamp duty holiday, which came into effect on July 8 and will last until March 31 next year.

Prices had been falling in May and June as the lockdown paralysed the housing market.

Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS said: 'The latest RICS survey provides firm evidence of a strong uplift in activity in the housing market which should help support the wider economy gain traction over the coming months.

'Meanwhile the results provide a further pointer to more substantive changes taking place in household behaviour in the wake of the pandemic.

'Increased demand for properties with garden and near green spaces has if anything increased since we tested the water in May.'

But commentators are worried the recovery in house prices may be short-lived.

As well as concerns about rising unemployment when the Job Retention Scheme closes, experts are worried that the end of the stamp duty holiday next March will also hit demand.
