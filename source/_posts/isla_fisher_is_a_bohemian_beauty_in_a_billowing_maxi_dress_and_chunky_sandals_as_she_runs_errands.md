She never puts a foot wrong with fashion. 

So it was no surprise to see Isla Fisher looking effortlessly chic as she ran errands in Los Angeles on Wednesday. 

The Australian actress, 44, opted for a boho vibe as she teamed a maxi dress with chunky sandals.

Isla looked radiant in a white Tory Burch smock that featured navy embroidery along the sleeves and hemline. 

Keeping her accessories simple, she slung a brown handbag over her shoulder, and subtly boosted her petite frame with chunky white sandals. 

The mother-of-three swept her famous auburn tresses back into a bun and accessorised with a pair of gold hooped earrings and wayfarer shades - opting for a plain white face mask.

Isla found fame starring on Home and Away before landing roles in several Hollywood blockbusters, including Confessions of a Shopaholic and The Great Gatsby.  

Isla currently has three films in post-production, Blithe Spirit, Godmothered and Unplugging - but fans will no doubt be keen to see if she's landed a role in the surprise Borat sequel.   

Isla has been married to comedian and filmmaker Sacha Baron Cohen, 48, since 2010 and back in 2016 they collaborated on his action comedy, Grimsby. 

Sacha's most famous film, Borat is now set to get a sequel - which has already been filmed and screened for 'a select few industry types,' according to a new report from Collider.

Cohen, 48, had previously revealed in 2007 that he was planning to retire both his Borat and Ali G characters, though it seems he had a change of heart. 

The sequel reportedly follows Cohen's Borat, who, after the release of the 2006 Borat film, thinks he's a huge movie star.

He tries hiding from the public, interviewing people while taking on different alter-egos along the way.

One source described the meta sequel as, 'Cohen playing Borat playing Cohen.'
