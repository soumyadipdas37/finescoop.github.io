Daniel James' loan move to Leeds is dependent on Jadon Sancho completing a move to Manchester United, according to reports.

The 22-year-old Welshman started United's 3-1 home defeat against Crystal Palace last week but was left out of the squad for Saturday's 3-2 win at Brighton.

Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa is interested in the United winger and The Sun report he will be allowed to head across the Pennines to Elland Road with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer willing to let him leave temporarily for the campaign.

Manchester United will allow winger Daniel James to join Leeds United on loan this window

But United will only sanction the deal if they can land Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho 

However, the report adds the Norwegian will only be willing to do so if he can find a replacement for James - who at the moment represents the only back-up to Mason Greenwood - with Sancho the frontrunner to be that player.

Sportsmail revealed on Sunday that United are preparing a last-gasp bid to prise Borussia Dortmund star Sancho away before the transfer window slams shut next week.

Dortmund have been adamant in recent weeks that the £108million-rated England international will stay with them for the season.

But having missed out on Gareth Bale and Jack Grealish this summer, United are expected to offer around £65m plus achievable add ons up to £90m for Sancho, whose potential arrival would then allow James to head out on a season-long loan.

But right now James represents the only back-up to Mason Greenwood as is being kept for now

James almost joined Leeds on transfer deadline day back in January 2019, only for Swansea to pull the plug on the deal at the last-minute after he had already passed a medical.

But Bielsa's side have been in regular contact with United over a potential move for the winger and the renewed interest could finally see the Welsh star arrive at the newly-promoted outfit.  

However, if United are unable to reach a compromise with Dortmund, both the Old Trafford club and their Elland Road counterparts will be forced to look elsewhere for recruitments ahead of next week's deadline.

United are among clubs to have been linked with Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik and Bournemouth's Josh King while Ivan Perisic of Inter and Douglas Costa of Juventus have also been discussed.

And should Sancho make the move James would then be free to join Marcelo Bielsa's side
