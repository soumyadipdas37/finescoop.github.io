Brian Austin Green's tattooed 'girlfriend' Tina Louise has gained plenty of admirers while on the arm of the former 90210 star. 

And the 39-year-old certainly ensured all eyes were on her yet again when she stripped down to lace lingerie for a raunchy shoot. 

Taking to Instagram, where she has 2.4 million followers, Tina left her fans gobsmacked as she worked the camera kneeling on a couch.

The beauty was holding an antique phone in the eyebrow-raising photographs. 

Tina looked absolutely dazzling with her glossy makeup-style while choosing to wear her cropped blonde hair slightly wavy. 

'Does anyone actually still have a landline?' she wrote playfully.

It comes after Tina clapped back at haters who told her to cover up.    

During an Instagram Q&A on Wednesday, the Australian model was told to cover up, and one troll even asked: 'Why do you need to show your body that much?'

Tina responded by sharing a video of herself in a racy swimsuit, which drew attention to her sensational curves and pert derrière.

'Does it offend you that I'm confident and comfortable with my sexuality?' she wrote.   

Tina has gone from social media star to bona fide celebrity since her fling with the Beverly Hills, 90210 actor made headlines in July.

Tina was spotted with Brian on a Los Angeles beach last week, following talk the pair were no longer seeing each other.

The father-of-four, who is separated from wife Megan Fox, was unable to take his eyes off the bombshell.

He had reportedly split with Tina at the end of July after a month of dating, only for them to reconcile weeks later.

It comes just days after Brian told his Instagram followers he would 'never say never' to getting back with Megan.

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he said during a livestream on Saturday.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he added. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'

Meghan started dating rapper Machine Gun Kelly, whose real name is Colson Baker,  less than a month after her split with Brian.

Brood: Brian and Megan share three children: Bodhi, six, Journey, four, and Noah, seven. He also has another son, 18-year-old Kassius, from his previous relationship with Vanessa Marcil
