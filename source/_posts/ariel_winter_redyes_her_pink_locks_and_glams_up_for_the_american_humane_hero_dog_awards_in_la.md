Modern Family alum Ariel Winter flaunted her surgically-reduced assets in a white sheer puff-sleeved corseted ASOS top to attend the American Humane Hero Dog Awards in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

For the first time in months, the 22-year-old LA native hit the red carpet for the awards show airing October 19 on the Hallmark Channel.

Curiously, no one protected themselves or others from the coronavirus by wearing a mask or face covering, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for public outings on June 18.

As of Thursday, there have been over 264K confirmed coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 6,455 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University. 

Winter (born Workman) resembled a real-life pin-up in her pink leather Noour Hammour mini-skirt, baby-blue Marie De La Roche purse, and matching Stuart Weitzman heels selected by styling duo Dani + Emma.

Ariel - who boasts 5M Instagram/Twitter followers - captioned her snap: 'Served you up some cotton candy & flowers for your Wednesday!'

Pretty: Rather than pink, make-up artist Ash K. Holm used a shimmering Marc Jacobs copper eye shadow on Winter and she teased up her bushy brows

Ariel's post caught the eye of her boyfriend of nine months, Grand Isle actor Luke Benward, who commented with a heart-eye emoji.

The Tennessee-born 25-year-old is the four-time SAG Award winner's first public romance since ending her two-year relationship with live-in love Levi Meaden in August 2019.

The acting couple co-produced and co-starred as Annie and Adam in the Baer Brothers' directorial debut Don't Log Off, which wrapped production on July 31.

In the COVID-19 era indie comedic thriller, Winter plays a woman who disappears during her virtual Zoom surprise birthday party, and her friends have to find her.

Ariel gushed of the film: 'This movie really is an ensemble and I'm honored to be sharing the screen with my friends, and producing this with a few of them as well!'

The aspiring federal prosecutor previously stated that she planned on resuming her studies at UCLA after dropping out in March 2018.
