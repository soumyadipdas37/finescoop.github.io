The Bachelor's 'Love in Lockdown' episodes come to an end during Wednesday night's episode of the show as Locky Gilbert and the ladies vying for his heart return to the mansion.

And after time apart, it seems the friendship between Locky's two favourites -Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovksa - comes to a dramatic end. 

In the clip, the best friends have a heated conversation at the cocktail ceremony.

'I don't trust you!' Bella Varelis ends her friendship with Irena Srbinovksa during dramatic scenes on The Bachelor on Wednesday night 

'I actually can't f***ing deal with this to be honest,' Bella says in the promo as she wipes away tears.

While the reason for the conflict between the friends is not explained in the promo, it appears that a lack of 'trust' is the reason behind their conflict.

'Irena, I don't trust you anymore,' the brunette tells the nurse, who defiantly responds: 'I don't trust you.' 

'Then great, friendship done,' Bella declares as she storms off.

Elsewhere in the trailer, Locky welcomes the nine remaining ladies and new intruder Bec Cvilikas back to the mansion.

The tattooed hunk, 31, is instantly taken aback by the blonde stunner.

The clip then cuts to what appears to be then end of Locky's date with Bec, where he confesses: 'Yeah, Bec could literally be the one.'
