She's been enjoying some downtime in New York City after moving to Los Angeles during the coronavirus lockdown.

And Dua Lipa was in good company as she strolled across the Big Apple with her boyfriend Anwar Hadid on Tuesday afternoon.

The One Kiss hitmaker, 25, styled her white face mask with a brown and yellow top and high-waisted wide-leg trousers.

Standing out, the singer's long-sleeved clothing item was embellished with floral printing throughout.

The musician ensured she showcased her typically edgy style by boosting her frame in chunky black boots.

The outing comes days after Anwar became an uncle, following news his sister Gigi had given birth to a baby girl with boyfriend Zayn Malik.

It was reported last month that songstress Dua has upped sticks and travelled across the pond to Los Angeles to be closer to California native Anwar.

The Sun reported the brunette has relocated stateside to live with her partner due to fears that she won't be able to travel to and fro because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK.

A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end.

'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic.

'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time.

Congratulations! The outing comes days after Anwar became an uncle, following news his sister Gigi had given birth to a baby girl with boyfriend Zayn Malik (pictured)
