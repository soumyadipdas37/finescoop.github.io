Host commentator

That's all for our coverage of Barcelona's win against Villarreal. Thank you for following the game with us. 

Barcelona's overall performance was very impressive and Koeman's 4-2-3-1 system worked well.

Villarreal, meanwhile, struggled and there is much work for Unai Emery to do. 

The game is over, and it's a winning start for Koeman. Fati scored a brace, Messi netted a penalty and Pau Torres turned the ball into his own net. 

90 mins - Messi is still looking for another goal and sends a free-kick over. 

89 mins - Kubo is continuing to threaten and forces Neto to make a save

86 mins - Messi has another effort tipped over. Pjanic has done well since being brought on, while Kubo has impressed for Villarreal. 

Gerard Moreno goes into the book for Villarreal for a clash with Pique. 

Funes Mori comes on for Albiol. Bacca is on for Moreno.

81 mins - Villarreal, to their credit, haven't been disheartened and have continued to push forward with regularity. Gaspar's effort goes over. 

Two debutants for Barcelona as Trincao and Pjanic enter the fray. Griezmann and Busquets are the players to make way 

73 mins: A rare moment of alarm for Barcelona as De Jong loses the ball, but Clement Lenglet is there to clear the danger. 

Meanwhile, Kubo, on loan from Real Madrid, replaces Chukwueze for Villarreal. 

71 mins: Alba gets forward well again and picks out Messi, but the Argentina star's header is off target. 

It was a very good performance from Coutinho, who could prove to be a crucial player for Koeman this season.

Those Barcelona changes are made, with Dembele and Pedri replacing Fati and Coutinho. 

65 mins: Messi's effort is tipped over the crossbar. It looks like Dembele and Pedri are about to come on. 

62 mins - Frenkie de Jong is pushing forward to good effect at times. It certainly wouldn't be a surprise if Barcelona were to add to their lead.

56 mins - Barcelona are determined to add to their considerable lead, and Griezmann goes for goal, but his effort is blocked. 

53 mins - Villarreal have looked a little more threatening since Emery's changes, but Barcelona's defence are coping well so far

51 mins - It has been a very quiet night for Neto so far, but the Barcelona goalkeeper is alert on this occasion to rush off his line and clear the danger. 

48 mins - Barcelona are continuing to push forward with regularity. Ansu Fati is still at the heart of proceedings and plays a lofted pass into the path of Messi, who sees his shot saved.

The second half is underway at the Nou Camp, with Emery making a couple of changes for Villarreal. Trigueros and Iborra are on for Coquelin and Alcacer. 

It has been a hugely impressive first half for Koeman's side, with Fait netting a brace, Messi scoring a penalty and Pau Torres' own goal adding to the scoreline.   

Messi plays a wonderful ball into the box and Villarreal defender Pau Torres inadvertently turns it into his own net. 

Barcelona are starting to work the ball very well and one intricate move concludes with Coutinho trying his luck and his effort being tipped over by Asenjo.

Alcacer thought he had a chance to score but Neto claimed it and the flag was up anyway

Messi steps up to convert the penalty, despite Asenjo diving the right way. 

Fati wins a penalty as he's brought down by Mario Gaspar.

Francis Coquelin, who joined Villarreal from Valencia, doesn't look sharp at all and has been struggling physically in the opening weeks of the campaign. 

Estupinan pushes forward for Villarreal but his effort lacked conviction. They've struggled to supply Gerard Moreno

25 mins: Barcelona are utterly dominant at the moment. Alba is getting forward with ease, and the left-back sees his shot saved.

Fati's quality was already clear last season but this could be a hugely productive campaign for the 17-year-old. It appears that Ronald Koeman has a lot of faith in the winger, who will be looking to progress even further. 

It's another goal for Fati, with Coutinho finding the talented young winger. Villarreal's defending was disappointing but it's still a well-worked goal.

Barcelona get the first goal of the Ronald Koeman era. Jordi Alba finds Ansu Fati, who finishes excellently to open the scoring. 

Villarreal have kept their shape well so far and have looked rather composed despite Barcelona's quality. 

Barcelona are starting to get into the game. Alba won a corner, with Coutinho subsequently seeing a shot deflected away

At the moment Griezmann is on the right wing with Messi up front

The game is underway at the Nou Camp.

While Barcelona are attempting to restore their reputation, the same applies to Unai Emery.

His spell at Arsenal certainly didn't go to plan, but, back in Spain, he will hope that he will be able to make a major impact at Villarreal. 

The conclusion to last season was hugely frustrating for Barcelona as they ended the campaign without a trophy and were thrashed 8-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League.

Koeman faces a tough task in attempting to improve Barcelona's fortunes. Coutinho's return, though, could be a major boost. 

While Barcelona are playing their first league game of the season, this is Villarreal's third fixture. They have four points so far.

Unai Emery can call upon the likes of Gerard Moreno and Paco Alcacer. 

Villarreal: Asenjo; Gaspar, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan; Chukwueze, Parejo, Coquelin, Gomez; Moreno, Alcacer.

Subs: Bacca, Baena, Trigueros, Funes Mori, Rulli, Cabrera, Jaume Costa, Kubo, Iborra

Ronald Koeman has named his first official starting lineup as Barcelona manager.

Philippe Coutinho, back from his loan spell at Bayern Munich, is involved from the outset, as is Ansu Fati, who has been officially promoted to the first-team squad.

Lionel Messi, of course, also starts after he ended up staying at the club.

Neto is in goal, with Marc-Andre Ter Stegen out injured. 

Barcelona: Neto; Roberto, Pique, Lenglet, Alba; Busquets, De Jong; Messi, Coutinho, Fati; Griezmann

Subs: Pena, Rafinha, Araujo, Dembele, Pjanic, Tenas, Ramos, Firpo, Puig, Alena, Trincao, Pedri.
