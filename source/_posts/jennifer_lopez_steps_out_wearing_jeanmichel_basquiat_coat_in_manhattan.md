Jennifer Lopez looked stylish as ever as she was spotted out in New York City on Tuesday.

With her golden brown locks styled high on her head, the 51-year-old singer looked fierce as she rocked skintight jeans and a black blouse.

Adding a touch of glam to her look the songstress wore towering platform boots and some oversize shades and hoop earrings.

Meanwhile, Lopez is feeling grateful for extra family time amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

She tells PEOPLE that before the lockdowns happened, family dinners where everyone got together were not that frequent.

The star, who has 12-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex-husband Marc Anthony, is engaged to former MLB player Alex Rodriguez.

Rodriguez has daughters Natasha, 15, and Ella, 12, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.

'That's been a huge blessing for us during this time,' she said of their now-nightly dinners.

'Because Alex and I have both separately and now together lived a gypsy-type life, as both of our careers require tons of travel. The blessing of the quarantine for us was having dinner with the kids every night, for months and months.

'I don't think that would've ever happened,' she added, 'and probably reminded us how much we need to do that more.'

Lopez told the publication that she hopes to continue the tradition when life gets back to normal.
