Victoria Beckham has gushed that her daughter Harper, nine, loves to spoil her after a busy day at work.

The fashion designer spoke out on her daily routine over the weekend, revealing she loves nothing more than an at-home pamper evening with her little girl.

The proud mum, 46, explained how her doting daughter runs her a salt bath after a long day and the two love to bond while making organic face masks together.

What a girl! Victoria Beckham has gushed that her daughter Harper, nine, loves to spoil her after a busy day at work by running her a relaxing salt bath

She explained: 'Harper often makes an Epsom bath soak for me when I get home from work.'

'She's also into beauty treatments which is really sweet. Sometimes we make our own face masks with a little manuka honey and organic oats.' 

The former Spice Girls singer - who also has three sons with husband David Beckham - thinks it is a real 'luxury' if her evening allows her time not only for a pampering session but also to fit in reading a chapter from a book.

She said: 'My Cell Rejuvenating Power Serum and Priming Moisturizer are my nightly staples to repair my skin while I sleep. The serum changed my skin and is the power player in my regime.

'Sometimes I have the time to add a face mask and read a few pages of a good book – luxury.' 

Speaking to Stella magazine, Victoria also opened up on her exercise routine, admitting: 'I work out every day - I see it like brushing your teeth, it's just something you do. I normally do an uphill walk on the treadmill, followed by a Tracy Anderson routine.'  

And Victoria makes sure she gets up before the rest of her household so she gets some time to herself.

She said: 'I try to get up before everyone else – it's my time for me. I have hot water with lemon and apple cider vinegar to help maintain a healthy digestive system. I also have two cups of black coffee to properly wake me up.'
