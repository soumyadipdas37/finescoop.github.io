A mum who was busted with $500 worth of ice stashed down her bra pleaded with a magistrate to spare her a conviction so she couldn't continue a relationship with a man in U.S. 

Lynette Pilgrim, 60, was caught with 1.16g of methamphetamine in Townsville, Queensland, on November 16, 2019, but told Townsville Magistrate's Court she was 'keeping it for a friend'.

Townsville Magistrates Court heard on Monday that police saw her car pulled over in the suburb of Douglas and suspected she may be carrying drugs, the Townville Bulletin reported.

The trained masseuse was caught again on May 13 parked outside Kirwan Police Station at 1.50am.

Pilgrim was breathalised and blew 0.07 - two points over the legal limit.

She pleaded guilty to possessing dangerous drugs and driving over the alcohol limit.

Prosecutor Tim Madsen told the court she had a history of drug offences that never resulted in a conviction.

He also said Pilgrim had almost a completed a course run by the the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Service.

Mr Douglas said a conviction may stop her from getting work and could impact her relationship with a man in the US.

Magistrate Ross Mack recorded the conviction, fined her $1,100 and banned her from driving for two months.
