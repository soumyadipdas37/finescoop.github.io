Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey is reportedly interested in becoming the latest star name to arrive at Arsenal.

The 27-year-old Ghana international has become a household name in Madrid and a mainstay of Diego Simeone's side, though can leave the club if his £44million release clause is triggered.

This summer Arsenal have been heavily linked and now the player is open to making the move happen, according to Goal.

Partey's current deal runs until 2023, though it is reported that the financial impacts of the coronavirus pandemic have resulted in Atletico being unable to offer the player a financially lucrative extension.

Simeone is said to be very keen on keeping hold of his player, though talks between Partey and Atletico have not been fruitful.

Arsenal look set to make a move for the midfielder, though Arteta has already been told he must sell to generate funds this summer.

The Gunners are waiting on bids for the likes of Matteo Guendouzi and Emiliano Martinez this summer, while looking set to agree a loan deal for Sead Kolasinac to return to Schalke.

Exciting youngster Ainsley Maitland-Niles is also heavily tipped to move to Wolves. 

This would reduce the sizeable wage bill at the Emirates, which remains crippled by the out-of-favour Mesut Ozil.

Arsenal have already gone about some impressive business, sealing the signature of free agent Willian who has moved across London from rivals Chelsea.

On Tuesday the Gunners confirmed the £27m signing of defender Gabriel from Lille, with Arteta further bolstering his suspect defensive line.
