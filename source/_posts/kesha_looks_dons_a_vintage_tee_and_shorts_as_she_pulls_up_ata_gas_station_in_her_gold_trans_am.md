Kesha rocked a vintage Neil Young tee and a black cloth face mask that featured a daisy chain and the word 'Vote' written across it.

The Animal songstress looked noticeably makeup-free and had a pair of brown shades tucked into her wavy brunette hair. 

Kesha carried a brown paper bag in her hand and trekked across the gas station in a pair of hot pink slide sandals.
