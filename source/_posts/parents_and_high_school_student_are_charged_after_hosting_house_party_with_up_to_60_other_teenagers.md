The parents along with their child who is a student at a Massachusetts high school have been charged after allegedly hosting a party at their home, in direct violation of social host laws which forbid the distribution of alcohol to minors. 

Although those involved have not yet been named, all three are facing charges for violating the state's social host law in Framingham District Court near Boston.

Their child was charged in Framingham Juvenile Court. 

Around 60 students from Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High attended a house party just outside of Boston

The school at which the teens attended, Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High, has now shifted to remote learning instead of adopting a hybrid model as a result of the mass gathering

Authorities believe that between 50 and 60 high schoolers were at the the party where social distancing was not observed and masks were not being worn.

The party appears to go directly against measures put in place by the school district that saw remote learning introduced from the very start of the school year. 

Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School had originally intended to operate a hybrid model with some students attending for some of the time before rotating with other groups.

However, last week it shelved such plans and decided to go fully towards remote learning.     

Police have had trouble tracking down all those who attended the party after dozens ran off into nearby woods and several others gave false names

Officials are having some difficulty identifying exactly who went to the the party after Superintendent and Principal Bella Wong said around 15 students ran into the woods.

A further 13 students deliberately gave the police false names.  

'After the intensity of hard work and planning that has been done to be able to start school with students in-person, we are profoundly disappointed at this sudden change of plans,' Principal Wong wrote in a letter to parents.   

The Sudbury Board of Health is now requesting asked anyone who went the party to be tested for COVID and to notify both the Health Department and the school district if students suddenly start to show symptoms of coronavirus. 

The school was going to have some students attend for a couple of weeks at a time while other groups learned remotely. Now, the entire school has shifted online
