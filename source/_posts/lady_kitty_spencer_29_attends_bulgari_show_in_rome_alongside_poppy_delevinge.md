During the evening the models and film stars were seen catching up in the luxurious setting, with Lady Kitty and Poppy ensuring to keep their distance as they sat on mirrored stools.

The blonde beauties were later seen posing for some snaps together, with Poppy putting an arm around Lady Kitty. 

Last week, Kitty joined a host of other fashionistas who flew into Tuscany to enjoy at least three different events hosted at exclusive venues across the city by D&G.

She jetted off to the French Riviera earlier this month and has now made her way to Italy, where she has enjoyed the views of a volcanic crater south of Rome, visited the town of Nemi and toured the Pope's summer palace. 

Tonight's outing comes days after Lady Kitty put on a loved-up display with fiancé £80million fashion tycoon Michael Lewis as they shopped for rings in Florence. 



The society model reportedly got engaged to fashion tycoon Lewis, 61, who is 32 years her senior and five years older than her father Earl Spencer, after Michael proposed in Cape Town over Christmas. 

Lady Kitty and Michael went public with their relationship during a stroll through New York in May and were seen kissing after leaving Club 55 in St Tropez in August.  

Princess Diana 's niece opted for classic black dress which featured a corset top, full-skirt and dot pattern

The royal appeared in high spirits as she attended the event in Rome this evening, and could e seen  twirling in her sheer black gown 

An expert previously revealed that the society model was wearing an emerald cut diamond engagement ring with an estimated 30 carats of flawless diamonds.

Speaking to MailOnline, appraiser Oliver Horner from Prestige Pawnbrokers of Channel 4's Posh Paw, said: 'This gorgeous full hoop diamond full band engagement ring is of extremely high quality.

'The full band is set with large emerald cut diamonds, each stone looks to be approximately one and a half carats and I would estimate the total diamond weight of the ring to be between 25 and 30 carats. 

Lady Kitty, who has spent the last few weeks attending events across Italy, beamed as she posed for snaps in her stunning black gown 

The royal posed for pictures alongside socialite Poppy Delevinge, who opted for a daring black number for the event 

'Judging from the image the diamonds look to be of exceptional quality and I estimate a clarity grade to be between flawless and VVS1 and to be of D to F colour which is the very best.

'I believe a ring of this exceptional quality would have an would cost between £200,000 - £300,000 maybe even more given the provenance of such a piece.'

Kitty grew up in Cape Town and spent Christmas, her birthday and New Year's Eve in South Africa, where Michael is also based.

Lady Kitty joined a host of others at the event, donning a black mask to match her stunning gown 

The 29-year-old wore a black face covering during the event, and accessorised with a bold pink clutch bag 

Michael has three adult children and was previously married to a woman named Leola in 1985.

Kitty, who was spotted at the tycoon’s £19 million mansion in central London last summer, told the Mail at the time that she didn’t feel 'in any rush' to start a family.

'I can see myself having children at some point... but I'm only in my twenties. I do have friends my age who are having children, and they are so, so, sweet, but I think everyone should do things in their own time.'

Lewis' previous wife, Leola, 59, signed a prenuptial agreement but it's not yet known whether Lady Kitty will do the same.
