A spinoff series for the bonafide superhero hit -- The Boys -- has reportedly been in the works for awhile.

But now, following the massive success of the original show's second season, Amazon Prime is fast-tracking the development and production for the spin-off, according to several publications including Deadline.

The news comes just three weeks after the season two premiere of The Boys, which is now Amazon's most-watched launch of an original series in its history, with the episodes to date having grown viewership by 89% compared to season one. 

Major push: Amazon Prime has fast-tracked development of The Boys spin-off series

Based on a comic book of the same name written by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, the original series takes place in an America where superheroes have been morally corrupted by their celebrity status.

Karl Urban (Billy Butcher) plays the leader of a team of vigilantes, known as The Boys, who watch over and combat any of the superheroes who abuse their abilities.

The untitled spin-off will be set at America's only college for young adult superheroes that's run by Vought International. To date, it's been described as an irreverent, R-rated series that explores the lives of hormonal, competitive Supes as they put their physical, sexual, and moral boundaries to the test, competing for the best contracts in the best cities.

As a whole, the spin-off series is said to be part college show and part Hunger Games -- combined with all the heart, satire and raunch of The Boys.

Original series writer and executive producer Craig Rosenberg is penning the pilot episode and will serve as showrunner and executive producer under his overall deal with Sony Pictures Television. 

The Boys creator Eric Kripke will also serve as executive producer along with Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver of Point Grey Pictures and Original Film's Neal H. Moritz and Pavun Shetty.

Amazon Studios and Sony Pictures Television will produce.
