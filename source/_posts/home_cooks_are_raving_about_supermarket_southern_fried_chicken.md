Australian amateur cooks are stocking up on a new southern fried chicken offering at Coles supermarkets, calling it the perfect addition to any burger.

One woman shared a photo of her KFC-inspired dinner on social media, complete with a hearty burger and a side of chips, crediting the grocer for its new range.

'How to make a fried chicken burger. I used the Aldi brioche buns, hands down my favourite... I always go out of my way to buy them,' she said.

'Then I bought Coles southern fried chicken in the meat section and Coles special burger sauce, which we are obsessed with and use as a chip dip as well.'

Finally a handful of potatoes were cooked in an air fryer for maximum crispiness and enjoyed alongside the burger.

The chicken, which is $8.50, can be bought as a breast piece or thighs, as well as tenders, depending on what kind of meal you want to put together.

They are to be cooked at 180C Celsius for 30-35 minutes and turned once at the 15-minute mark.

Plenty of people on Facebook said they also enjoyed making burgers with them, suggesting they were the perfect amount of 'crispiness'.

'Yummmmm. That Coles southern fried chicken is really tasty,' said one person.

'We do our Coles KFC-style chicken in the air fryer. It's definitely not spicy, otherwise I would not eat it,' said another.

A third added: 'Well that's dinner on the weekend sorted then'. 

Purchase Aldi's brioche buns, Coles' southern fried chicken, lettuce, tomato and Coles' special burger sauce and a layer of cheese.

Oven bake the southern fried chicken at 180C for 30-35 minutes, flipping it over at the 15-minute mark. 

Once each ingredient is stacked on the other, air fry a handful of potatoes to dip into the special burger sauce.

Southern fried chicken is a dish that consists of chicken pieces that have been coated in a seasoned batter and are pan-fried, deep-fried or pressure fried.   

The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the chicken while retaining the juices in the meat.

It was actually a dish created by the Scottish, who brought it to America, according to The Daily Meal.
