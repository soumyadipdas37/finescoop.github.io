Oli McBurnie has stressed his commitment to Scotland after returning to club action just two days on from pulling out of Steve Clarke’s national squad.

The Sheffield United striker’s second-half appearance in a friendly win over Derby County on Tuesday sparked anger amongst national team fans on social media.

However, Clarke moved quickly to defuse the situation, explaining how a conversation with Brammall Lane manager Chris Wilder left him convinced McBurnie was nowhere near fit enough to start up front against Israel in the Nations League on Friday night.

With the 24-year-old needing to work on his conditioning following a foot injury, the Scotland boss agreed with his Blades counterpart it was best for him to do so at his club.

Keen to add his side of the story, McBurnie insisted he would never let his country down and vowed to work his hardest to be fit for next month’s Euro 2020 home play-off semi-final against Israel then the Nations League visits of Slovakia and Czech Republic to Hampden.

In a statement posted on social media, McBurnie said: ‘Nobody is more frustrated than me at having to withdraw from the Scotland squad for this double header.

‘I know both my club and international managers have explained the situation but I feel it’s important I do too.

‘The reality is I haven’t been able to train at all for the last two weeks due to a cut in my foot that became infected.

‘Given that pre-season coincides with the Nations League matches as a result of the Covid-19 impact on football, the last thing I wanted to do was to let myself or my country down.

‘I was ready and willing to give it my best but both managers — probably rightly — took the decision out of my hands.

‘Playing a bit longer than expected in a friendly is a different world to an international double-header but I get how some people perceive it.

‘I will be supporting my team-mates from home and putting in the work to get fit for October. Stay safe and see you soon.’

Midfielder Kenny McLean claims critics of McBurnie have painted a target on the striker’s back.

Speaking after he signed a new three year deal with Norwich yesterday, McLean also leapt to the defence of his friend - claiming he comes in for unjustified criticism.

‘I don’t know if that’s just me saying that because he’s my mate,’ said the ex-St Mirren and Aberdeen midfielder.

‘Sometimes he will bring some stuff on himself, don’t get me wrong. But I think at times he seems to have a bit of a target on his back.

‘I don’t think it’s justified what people are saying just now. He’s not fit, what else can he do?

‘Does he come away and not train, train half the sessions and not be fit to play a qualifier? These are big games for us and we need everyone at 100 per cent and right now Oli is not 100 per cent. When he is, he’s a great asset for us.’

Yet to score his first Scotland goal, McBurnie has long divided opinion at Scotland level.

Last year the £20million man had to reiterate his commitment to the cause after disparaging remarks he made about playing for Scotland appeared on social media.

‘I think the people giving him stick don’t really know the whole story,’ added McLean. ‘They don’t know the position he’s been in.

‘I’ve been speaking to him a lot in the last few weeks and he’s been struggling with an injury.

‘He played in a pre-season game for Sheffield United after one day training. I think if he came away, played Friday and didn’t look fit he’d get even more stick.

‘I think he’s done the right thing, he’s trying to get himself fit. The manager has got plenty of options to choose from and if Oli was to come away 50 per cent fit then it wouldn’t be best for us and I think the manager looked at that as well.’
