Caitlyn Jenner is giving fans a closer glimpse at her life, after launching a YouTube channel this week.

And the Olympic gold medalist recently enjoyed a relaxing summer outing, after uploading her first batch of content.

She made an iced coffee run Tuesday, as she stepped out in a preppy chic ensemble, after spending a day at the golf course in Los Angeles.

The 70-year-old donned a white collared polo shirt, paired with a baby blue pleated skirt, featuring two rows of buttons down the legs.

She finished the ensemble with a pair of black sports sunglasses, a gold necklace and a pair of white trainers, while carrying a black leather handbag.

Caitlyn posted a video to Instagram on Monday of herself hiking, as she teased her new YouTube channel, telling her 10.3million Instagram followers: 'Maybe someday, I would start my own YouTube channel. So, that's what I've been doing.'

She then included the intro clip from her channel, featuring her flying a plane, doing her makeup, showing off one of her cars and cooking in the kitchen.

Caitlyn also gave a shoutout to ex-wife Kris Jenner, 64, in another video, as she made fettuccine with sausage and peppers from her 2014 cookbook In the Kitchen with Kris.
