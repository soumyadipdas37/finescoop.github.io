She recently broke up with her beau Cody Simpson.

And Miley Cyrus stripped topless on Instagram this Thursday while enjoying the single life at home on lockdown.

The 27-year-old showed off her sprawl of tattoos as she folded her arms over her front to avoid violating Instagram's Community Guidelines.

She started off by posing up a storm in a dark tank top and a pair of matching leather trousers, which she sultrily unbuttoned.

Miley then pulled her best smoldering supermodel stare while pulling her top off over her head in a bit of a striptease.

Wrapping her arms around herself she bit her lip beguilingly for the camera and leaned her head back slightly.

Her cropped hairdo was reminiscent of 61-year-old rock diva Joan Jett whose music Miley was listening to in the Insta Stories footage.

'Being single means having more alone time to video myself stripping naked to Joan Jett,' the blonde bombshell captained one of her clips.

She also uploaded a masked bathroom mirror selfie captioned: 'Mask 4 Mask,' in a play on the popular gay dating app phrase 'masc for masc.' 

Miley has been a longtime devoted fan of Joan and even gave the icon's induction speech into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall Of Fame in 2015.

During the speech she dished that she 'wanted to have sex with Joan Jett' when the dynamic duo performed together on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2011.

The pair have hit the stage together more than once and Miley also sang a medley of Joan's hits during her Gypsy Heart Tour in 2011.

Miley and her 23-year-old Australian boyfriend went into self-isolation together amid the coronavirus pandemic but last month it emerged they have split. 

The duo were longtime pals and Miley was even pictured attending Cody's star-studded 18th birthday bash.

'Miley is one of my best friends and she helps with some of that transitional stuff - trying to escape your childhood,' Cody told GQ Australia that year.

Her split from Cody came a year after her split from her husband Liam Hemsworth, whom she was married to for about nine months.

After she separated from Liam she had a whirlwind summer romance from Kaitlynn Carter who had herself recently split from reality TV dreamboat Brody Jenner. 

During a recent interview on The Joe Rogan Experience she shared that she was undergoing a 'pivotal moment' by being single again.

'I haven't been single in like, I guess really from 2015 - I mean, there's been little months, so maybe about five years. Like I've had, you know, a few months here and there where I've been single but not for a long period of time,' she said.
