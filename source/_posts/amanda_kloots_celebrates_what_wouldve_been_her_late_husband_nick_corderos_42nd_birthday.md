Amanda Kloots, the widow of Tony nominee Nick Cordero, tearfully celebrated what would have been his 42nd birthday on Thursday.

'My angel in heaven is celebrating his birthday today,' the grieving 38-year-old wrote to her 583K Instagram followers.

'Happy 42nd Birthday baby. I bet you're having quite the celebration up there, probably singing to everyone. [Our son] Elvis and I will be singing here on Earth to you.'

Amanda then shared two snaps and a short video of the Canadian triple-threat celebrating his 41st birthday one year ago at a friend's home in Laurel Canyon.

Kloots wrote: 'Right after he blew out his candles I remember him saying, "Come on! I'm so blessed!"'

To mark the occasion, the fitness trainer is releasing Live Your Life, an $18.87 album of Nick's cabaret act at Feinstein's/54 Below in Manhattan recorded back in April 2019.

'I've never seen my husband work so hard on a show, and boy, was he nervous,' Amanda told Broadway.com back in July.

'It was the first one-man show he had created, and he wanted to give the audience something to remember. Nick created a night of music and storytelling that was extremely personal too. It is a mix of Broadway, rock 'n' roll, standards and original music and, if you knew Nick, it was perfect!'

Guest performers on the album include Kathryn Gallagher (Jagged Little Pill), Drew Gehling (Waitress), Sara Chase (First Date), and Zach Braff (Bullets Over Broadway).

All proceeds from Live Your Life will benefit Kloots and their 15-month-old son Elvis Eduardo, who both rocked out to the record on Thursday.

The former Radio City Rockette - who met Nick in 2014 while performing in the Broadway musical Bullets Over Broadway - will also be going live on Instagram at 3pm PST to sing him Cordero happy birthday.
