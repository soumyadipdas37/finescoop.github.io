Kaysar Ridha was unanimously kicked off Big Brother All-Stars on Thursday's episode and Christmas Abbott also became the new Head of Household.

The two had gone head-to-head in the week's elimination ceremony, with Kaysar, 40, unsurprised that he was voted out by all 10 houseguests.

Kaysar, however, was so fed up with the way he'd been treated by them during his stay that he decided to 'light up the house' with bombshell revelations before he left.

'I just want to say I really love every one of you guys on a personal level,' Kaysar began. 'Now, when it comes to game play and strategy, I think you guys all suck. Here's why.'

The biotech executive then told everyone around him that there were several secret alliances in their midst, and that Cody Calafiore, 29, and Nicole Franzel, 28, were the leaders.

He didn't know how wrong he was about the alliances and their composition, and had no idea that his confidant, Robert 'Memphis' Garrett, 37, had created the biggest one.

Kaysar was shocked when he finally heard about Memphis' scheming, saying, 'Man, they got me.'

Exit interview: Kaysar was interviewed by host Julie Chen Moonves after he was evicted

He admitted to show host Julie Chen Moonves, 50, that he hadn't come back to win, anyway, but to be a voice for viewers by having conversations about things that impacted their lives: the need to transcend racism, or to keep religion from dividing people.

'I didn't come back for the money,' swore Kaysar, who also appeared on BB6 and BB7. 'I came back because Big Brother was a platform that changed my life 15 years ago, and I felt that it was so much more… it was a call to duty to come back to make a difference.'

As a father, he explained, he was 'not okay with the way the world is today. There's so much pain and division, and I felt that we had to take a stand, and somebody had to step up and say, 'There's a better way.' And I felt like that was why I was able to walk out of this house with my head held high.'

Duty called: 'I didn't come back for the money,' swore Kaysar, who also appeared on BB6 and BB7. 'I came back because Big Brother was a platform that changed my life 15 years ago, and I felt that it was so much more… it was a call to duty to come back to make a difference'

'Kaysar, that is exactly why the public voted you back in,' Julie told him, as Kaysar replied, 'Oh my God!' and she quickly corrected herself: 'Fifteen years ago. Back then, back then!'

Kaysar had known that he was doomed all week long, and he was almost reconciled to it.

He tried to sway Memphis' vote before the elimination ceremony by asking him if he was going to let The Slick Six, 'an alliance of four people,' run the house.

Alliance founder: Robert 'Memphis' Garrett was approached by Kaysar in a desperate attempt to forge an alliance unaware that he was being duped

What he didn't realize was that the alliance had six people and Memphis had started it.

In fact, in the 27 days since the BB cast entered the house, two primary alliances were essentially running everything that went on, and Kaysar identified neither one correctly.

'The Committee' included Christmas, Cody, Memphis, Nicole, Tyler Crispen, 23, and Dani Donato, 34.

The Slick Six contained Tyler, Dani, Cody, Enzo Palumbo, 42, Da'Vonne Rogers, 32, and Bayleigh Dayton, 27.

There was no doubt about Kaysar's eviction, but Enzo and Cody were also eyeballing Dani, who'd recently messed up by broadcasting Tyler's involvement in the Slick Six. 

'I call Dani ''The Gardener'',' Enzo said in a confessional. 'Plants seeds everywhere. She goes around every day to every room and waters the seeds. I'm done with it, man. Her game is messy; it's sloppy. I think The Gardener needs a weed-whacker right now.'

Worried that Dani might blow up his spot, Cody told Enzo that he was in The Committee, but Enzo was unperturbed, noting that he would remain faithful to Cody no matter what.

Tyler was equally irritated by Dani, saying she was 'just being so extra in this game.'

'She's loving planting seeds,' he affirmed. 'Dani is trying her best to turn everyone within the Slick Six against each other, and then just chill there in the middle. She is reckless and sloppy, and I want to be the one to end all the madness that she is spreading throughout this house.'

So extra: Tyler was equally irritated by Dani, saying she was 'just being so extra in this game'

In a series of conversations, Tyler, Bayleigh, and Da'Vonne all realized that Dani had been talking about them to others, which put an immediate target on her head.

'The Slick Six had the numbers to run this house,' Cody observed, also telling Enzo he was wary of Da'Vonne. 'But now, with all the mistrust that is going through the group, all this alliance has done is create chaos, turmoil and even more paranoia. This alliance is done.'

Elsewhere in the house, independent agents Ian Terry, 29, and Kevin Campbell, 40, had decided that Cody and Nicole were the key players in the show's existing alliances.

Ian felt that there was 'an octopus' in the house, with those two running everything from the head, and a bunch of sprawling arms, or disparate, smaller alliances, also at work.

He told Kaysar about his theory, and emphasized that his pal had nothing to lose if he wanted to 'light up the house' by revealing that information to others.

Kaysar liked the idea, saying, 'I might just light this house on fire. It sounds kinda fun.'

'Trust me,' Ian told Kaysar, growing emotional. 'My wish would have been a different nomination, against you. There's just no fricking way.'

At the week's elimination ceremony, Christmas made a rhyming speech that urged the houseguests to vote 'the HoH way,' and follow Enzo's unspoken wishes.

Kaysar then stood up to say his piece, and offered his convoluted take on the alliances.

'Cody and Nicole have been running this house from day one, and they have a secret alliance that's going to take them all the way to the end,' he proclaimed. 'Meanwhile, the guys have an alliance—Enzo, I already knew when we were talking—with David [Alexander, 30] and Tyler. And then the last alliance, of course, Dani and Nicole and Cody. Cody finds himself in this love triangle. But no one's willing to take a shot.'

'If you want to play All-Stars, then keep me here,' he urged the cast. 'We'll continue to play.'

Everyone then voted Kaysar out, with Dani calling his speech 'disrespectful and tasteless.'

Afterward, Kaysar sat in the BB studio with Julie and admitted that he'd known it was a long shot for him to stay, calling his speech a 'Hail Mary' to get votes.

'This season has been extremely friendly,' Kaysar pointed out. 'Nobody was wanting to pull any punches and no-one was wanting to take a stand. I figured we had to spice things up a bit. It was getting a little boring, as far as I was concerned.'

For the Head of Household competition, the houseguests played 'Filter Face-Off,' a game that required them to answer questions about heavily filtered cast photos.

Christmas answered the most questions correctly, and became the new HoH, replacing Enzo.

As the show ended, Julie promised that Sunday's episode would reveal which houseguests Christmas targeted for elimination.

It would also introduce a new room in the house: the BB basement, where contestants would play a game in the dark in order to earn three special powers.

Big Brother All-Stars will return Sunday on CBS.
