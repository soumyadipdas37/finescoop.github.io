Lily Allen and David Harbour have obtained a marriage license to wed in Las Vegas.

According to TMZ, the pop star, 35, and the Stranger Things actor, 45, have registered to marry in Sin City with a license that is valid for 12 months.

Public records obtained by the publication state the expiration date for the license is September 6 2021 - meaning they will need to wed within a year.

This comes days after Lily was seen strolling through New York flashing a sparkling diamond ring - fueling the unconfirmed rumours she and David are engaged.

They were with her daughters Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven, while taking a stroll through the city.

The quartet have been in New York of late - with the sudden license application hinting that the next stop on their jaunt could be Vegas.
