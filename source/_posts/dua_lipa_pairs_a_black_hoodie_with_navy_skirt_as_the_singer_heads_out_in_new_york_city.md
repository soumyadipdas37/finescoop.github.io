She introduced the world to her adopted puppy Dexter on July 31.

And Dua Lipa and her new best friend were again inseparable on Wednesday, with the English singer seen carrying the pooch under one arm as she stepped out in NYC.

Not seen was the 25-year-old's beau Anwar Hadid, with whom she has reportedly moved in to a Beverly Hills home.

The Electricity songstress wore a dark ensemble for the outing, pairing a black hoodie with a navy skirt.

On her feet Dua sported a pair of chunky black sneakers.

It was reported last week that Dua has upped sticks and traveled across the pond to Los Angeles to be closer to California native Anwar.

The Sun reported The One Kiss hitmaker has relocated stateside to live with her partner due to fears that she won't be able to travel to and fro because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK.

A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end.

'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic.

'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time.
