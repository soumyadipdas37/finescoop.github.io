Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks and his entourage are rumoured to be isolating in a lavish Gold Coast mansion after being granted an exemption from hotel quarantine.

As thousands of Australians are forced to stay in shoe box-sized hotel rooms guarded by the military, the A-lister and his cohort are believed to be relaxing on the 55-acre grounds at the Rivermead Estate in Queensland.

Hanks, 64, arrived in the Sunshine State on September 8 by private jet for the filming of Baz Lurhmann's Elvis Presley biopic, for which he is playing the rock legend's manager Colonel Tom Parker.

The two-time Oscar winner was given special exemption to isolate in non-official premises after he and his wife Rita Wilson contracted COVID-19 during their first visit in March.

While the cast and crew were thought to be staying at the Oracle resort in Broadbeach, The Courier-Mail reported the party moved to the mega-mansion in Guanaba, 25 minutes north of the Gold Coast.

Rivermead, which charges guests up to $6,000 per night, is a three-storey lodge that sleeps 19 and features a lake, tennis court, polo field, day spa and pool.

Manager Zak Gordon denied any knowledge of Hanks' accommodation plans, according to the publication.

The Hollywood heavyweight's arrival in Australia has been marred by controversy since his inaugural 2020 visit when he was stayed in the same building as one of the nation's first coronavirus victims.

Queensland's first reported case of COVID-19, a man from China, 44, was staying in at the Peppers Resort in the same building complex when he tested positive on January 28.

The man had only recently flown in from Wuhan, where the virus was first transmitted from animals to humans. 

Health workers clad in decontamination suits were photographed swarming the resort about 1.30pm that Tuesday.

A few days later, Hanks and Wilson are understood to have checked into the Oracle Apartments on the other side of the complex.

Hanks shocked the world when he announced that the couple were both suffering from coronavirus symptoms and were self-isolating.

'Hello, folks. Rita and I are down here in Australia,' he wrote.

'We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too.

'To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive. 

'Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed.

'We Hanks' will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?

'We'll keep the world posted and updated.'

The film production was shut down.

Following the Castaway star's arrival in Queensland in September, the state's Deputy Premier Steven Miles accused Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton of 'lying' about letting Hanks into the country, news.com.au reported.  

Mr Dutton attacked the Queensland government on September 11 over the star's exemption.

'If you are Tom Hanks from California, you are okay. If you are Tom Hanks from Chermside or Castle Hill, sorry, you are not coming in,' he said.

Mr Miles hit back at the Home Affairs Minister the following day, saying the Australian Border Force would have granted him permission.

'And what that means is that when Peter Dutton launched that extraordinary attack during the week, he was lying.

'He was saying that it was us that let Tom Hanks in, when in fact it was him and his own department that let Tom Hanks in,' Mr Miles claimed.

Queensland's borders are closed to Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT.
