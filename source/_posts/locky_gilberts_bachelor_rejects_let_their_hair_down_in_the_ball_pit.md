They were sent home before the finale episode of The Bachelor. 

But Gemma White, Charley Bond and Steph Harper looked to have had Locky Gilbert the furthest from their mind, at a nightclub on the Gold Coast on Friday.

Dressed to impress in flirty numbers, the starlets were in fits of giggles as they posed for photos in the ball pit. 

No love lost here! Locky Gilbert's Bachelor rejects Gemma White (centre), 28, and Charley Bond (left), 25, partied in the ball pit alongside Steph Harper (right), 26, at a nightclub relaunch party on the Gold Coast on Friday 

Gemma, 28, revealed her trim figure in a glitzy pink frock and styled her blonde tresses in voluminous waves.

Her makeup was high-octane, consisting of defined brows, false lashes, contoured cheekbones and a glossy lip.

The real estate professional kicked one lithe leg in the air, and threw her head back in laughter, as she lounged around in the ball pit with her gal pals.

Locky, who? Dressed in flirty numbers, the trio appeared to have had The Bachelor the furthest from their mind 

Winner: Gemma, Charley and Steph failed to make it to Thursday's finale episode, where Irena Srbinovska was chosen as Locky's leading lady 

Charley, 25, drew attention to her toned tummy in a white crop top and matching mini-skirt, and like Charley, opted for glamorous hair and makeup.

While Steph, 26, slipped her slender figure into a slinky white frock, and kept her beauty look fresh and natural. 

The trio seemed unperturbed by having not captured Locky's heart, with Irena Srbinovska chosen as his leading lady on Thursday's finale episode.

It wasn't just a Bachelor affair, with former Married At First Sight stars Jessika Power and Ines Basic lending their star power to the Bedroom Nightclub's relaunch party. 

Jessika, 27, accentuated her cleavage and trim figure in a pale blue frock and perspex heels.

The full-time influencer styled her cropped blonde locks sleek and straight, and her eyes were enhanced with defined brows, false lashes and kohl liner. 

Showing off a more urban dress sense, Ines, 30, donned a white crop top and relaxed-fit jeans, teamed with black pointy-toe heels and a red shoulder bag.
