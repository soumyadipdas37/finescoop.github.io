Dele Alli and Jose Mourinho fell out before Tottenham's weekend defeat to Everton, according to Gabriel Agbonlahor, with the England star now a potential makeweight in Gareth Bale's sensational return.

Midfielder Alli was taken off at half-time for Moussa Sissoko on Sunday afternoon as Spurs opened their Premier League campaign with a 1-0 home loss.

And Agbonlahor has claimed Alli had a disagreement with Mourinho in the lead-up to the season opener.

He told talkSPORT: 'I feel like they need a No 10 as well because I'm hearing from a good source that Dele Alli and Mourinho have fallen out.'

It comes with Alli, 24, potentially on his way to Real Madrid as part of the deal that could see Bale return to north London.

Chairman Daniel Levy led high-level discussions on Tuesday with the result that Spurs are in pole position - ahead of Manchester United - to sign the Welsh star.

Sportsmail reported that Real will agree to pay in excess of 50 per cent of Bale's astronomical wages of up to Â£500,000-a-week in order to facilitate the deal.

Tottenham are believed to have explored a loan or a permanent deal, which could include a swap for one of the club's premium first-team players, such as Alli, for Bale.

Alli has struggled to make an impression since Mourinho took charge of the club and the new Amazon documentary about the club reveals the manager has repeatedly questioned Alli's attitude.

Mourinho claimed Alli 'doesn't train well' and is 'lazy' in one of the episodes of 'All of Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur' and questioned his 'party boy' lifestyle.

Alli scored nine goals and contributed six assists in 38 appearances for Tottenham last season.

Former England forward Agbonlahor also believes that Spurs urgently need another striker to ease the goalscoring burden on Harry Kane.

He said: 'I feel if they don't get a striker and get off to a bad start, I can see Mourinho walking or getting the sack.

'He is used to spending money. He is not used to begging for a striker.'

Spurs travel to Bulgaria on Thursday for their first Europa League qualifier against Lokomotiv Plovdiv.
