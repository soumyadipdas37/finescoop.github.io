Jim Gaffigan says he has received death threats after the normally apolitical actor-comedian went on a Twitter rant over the weekend slamming President Trump and urging his supporters to vote for Joe Biden this November.

The 54-year-old star of The Jim Gaffigan Show wrote a lengthy post on his Facebook page on Sunday in which he shared a frightening comment from someone who reacted on social media to his anti-Trump tweets.

‘Unsubscribed - you’ll be looking over your shoulder the rest of your life,’ wrote a social media user.

‘The image that is connected to this post is one of the many messages I received that are quasi threatening or flat out threatening,’ Gaffigan wrote on Facebook.

The 54-year-old star of The Jim Gaffigan Show wrote a lengthy post on his Facebook page on Sunday in which he shared a frightening comment from someone who reacted on social media to his anti-Trump tweets. ‘Unsubscribed - you’ll be looking over your shoulder the rest of your life,’ wrote a social media user.

‘I have friends that have received much worse and I’m sure this guy is just engaging in some bluster.

‘We all know Trump is not a unifier but remember he and his cronies stoke hatred and violence.’

Gaffigan wrote that while he has ‘expressed support for gay rights and Black Lives Matter,’ he has in years past avoided taking strong political stances but that he felt compelled to speak up now because he believes Trump ‘is ruining and possibly has already ruined my country.’

‘I learned early in my stand-up career people don’t want to hear about politics from me,’ Gaffigan wrote.

‘I knew me talking politics wasn’t changing any minds and was only alienating half of the audience.’

Gaffigan wrote that he’s willing to alienate some of his fans with political statements due to what he believes is the urgency of the moment.

‘I feel a responsibility to coming generations, my children but selfishly I didn’t want to explain to my grandchildren that I didn’t fight to stop Trump,’ he wrote.

‘Maybe they will see that I stood up for decency, rule of law, and equality.

‘That’s way more important to me than selling out an arena.’

Gaffigan added: ‘To be clear upfront I don’t think anyone is going to let an actor or a comedian tell them who to vote for despite the fact that the current President is essentially both and actor and a comedian.

‘However, I’d be lying if I didn’t say I want to change some minds. Of course I do, I feel strongly about what is going in our country.’

On Friday, Gaffigan posted more than a dozen tweets slamming Trump and the Republicans.

He tweeted: ‘RIP Truth.’

In another tweet, he wrote: ‘Look Trumpers I get it. As a kid I was a cubs fan and I know you stick by your team no matter what but he's a traitor and a con man who doesn't care about you.

‘Deep down you know it. I'm sure you enjoy pissing people off but you know Trump is a liar and a criminal.’

Gaffigan also tweeted: ‘By the way you can't be against Cancel Culture and tell people to stay out of politics.

‘You know that time you did a job and didn't get paid? That's trump and you know it.’

In another tweet, Gaffigan hit out at Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, as ‘snobs and elite.’

‘Think they are on your side? Do you think they've ever done a real days work in their lives,’ he wrote.

‘Wake up.’

Gaffigan also tweeted: ‘to those of you who think Im destroying my career wake up. if trump gets elected, the economy will never come back.’

He then tweeted of Trump: ‘You know he lies. Constantly.

‘Yet you dont care? What because he insults people that make you and me feel dumb?’
