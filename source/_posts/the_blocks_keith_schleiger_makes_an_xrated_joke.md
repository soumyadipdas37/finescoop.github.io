He's The Block's no-nonsense foreman, but on Monday's episode, Keith Schleiger made an X-rated joke that left one of the show's contestants lost for words.

Without missing a beat, Keith cheekily asked George Bragias if he had 'trouble getting it up', after noticing his ceiling lying on the floor.

While it took the 33-year-old electrician a moment to register what Keith had actually meant by the comment, he was left red-faced by the raunchy remark.

After coming in to inspect the work on George's master bedroom, Keith noticed the home's original ornate ceiling was lying on the floor.

'You're doing demo, too. Now, I presume you want to keep this,' Keith told him after they'd carefully removed the ceiling to ensure it remained intact.

He added: 'What happens if something falls on it and it just breaks it, or if you stand on it?'

George then explained that while he'd tried to move the ceiling off the floor, it had proven to be 'impossible'.

'We're gonna need six, seven guys to get this, so it's going to have to stay here at least so I can try and get it up,' George explained.

Without missing a beat, Keith asked: 'Do you have trouble getting it up?'

'We're gonna need six, seven guys to get this, so it's going to have to stay here at least so I can try and get it up,' George explained of the ceiling

'Yeah,' responded George, before realising what he meant, prompting him to burst out laughing.

A stony-faced Keith then slowly turned his head up to look at the ceiling, as George continued to laugh at his racy joke.

The scene then cut away without any further explanation, but it was obvious what Keith had meant by the double entendre.
