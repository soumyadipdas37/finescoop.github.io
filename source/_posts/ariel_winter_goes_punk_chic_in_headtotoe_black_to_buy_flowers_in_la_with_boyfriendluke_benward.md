Ariel Winter has been known to serve a stunning beauty transformation, and she's already been through four hair colors this year alone.

The former child star debuted her latest look over Labor Day weekend, as she dyed her hair pink.

She showed off the new 'do Sunday, as she went punk chic in head-to-toe black, while picking up a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of red with boyfriend Luke Benward at Gelson's Market in Los Angeles.

The 22-year-old donned a retro black printed t-shirt from a pool hall in Irvine, California, with matching skintight leggings.

She finished the ensemble with a black face mask and a matching pair of leather booties, while carrying a black YSL crossbody handbag.

She showed off a bleach blonde look in July, referencing the similarly blonde Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen and her own name in the caption: 'Winter Is Coming!!!!!!!!!!!'

It came after she returned to her signature red look back in February, writing: 'I’m a strawberry and a shortcake sooooo new nickname?'

The Speed Racer actress previously posted one last photo of her natural dark brown hair, writing: 'bye bye dark hair :) I don’t think I’ll miss you :)))'

She bid farewell to the dark 'do shortly after bidding farewell to her Modern Family character Haley Dunphy.

Winter starred as the brainy daughter and sister in the ABC sitcom since it premiered in 2009, before coming to an end with its 11th season.

She told Teen Vogue in April after the show wrapped: 'This is new territory for me. I was doing something very specific for so long. Now I have to reset my mind and retrain myself to be in that place of, "All right, I am ready to look for the next thing." 

'I am ready to work. I am ready to do everything I can. I am ready to be in the right mindset to go in there again and be able to face the rejection that will come, and be able to move past that and go to the next audition and be ready for it. And be ready for things in my personal life. Just living.'

The native Angeleno has since booked a role in the upcoming comedy-thriller Don't Log Off, which is set in the early days of the COVID-19 lockdown.

Winter stars in the film alongside boyfriend Luke Benward, 25, with whom she's been spending her quarantine.
