Three MTA employees have been suspended after converting a storage room beneath a Grand Central Terminal platform into a 'man cave' that they used to 'hang out and get drunk and party.'

A new report from the MTA Inspector General on Thursday revealed that all three unidentified men were served disciplinary charges and suspended without pay. 

Inspector General Carolyn Pokorny said evidence found inside the unauthorized break room were linked to a wireman, electrical foreman and carpenter foreman.

Two complaints previously flagged the unauthorized break room,but the MTA IG's office said that Metro-North officials did not investigate the claims 

'Many a New Yorker has fantasized about kicking back with a cold beer in a prime piece of Manhattan real estate – especially one this close to good transportation,' she said in a statement.

'But few would have the chutzpah to commandeer a secret room beneath Grand Central Terminal & make it their very own man-cave, sustained with MTA resources, and maintained at our riders’ expense.' 

The report said that the secret 'man cave' was discovered under Track 114 and behind the locked door of a locksmith shop. 

The MTA Inspector General's Office released photos showing various items, including this Amazon network item, that were found inside the man cave during the investigation 

Per the report, cabinets were fond around the storage room and appeared to be specifically installed to hide lounges

The space was outfitted with a futon, exercise equipment, a futon, microwave, fridge and beds, according to photos shared in the report. A bottle of cranberry juice, a peanut butter container and an opened beer can were inside the refrigerator. 

Wooden cabinets found inside the storage room appeared to specifically designed to conceal the TV and futon. 

The three Metro-North MTA employees have denied ever being in the room, but the Inspector General's office called that claim 'implausible.'

The report said that the carpenter foreman's smartphone hot spot was connected to the TV's network

'Evidence that the three MNR employees had used the Unauthorized Breakroom is overwhelming,' the report said. 

'First, there is strong physical evidence, unique to these employees, linking all three to the space for recreation.'

Investigators found two data books inscribed with the electrical foreman's name, a media streaming device with his name and a pull-up bar in a package with his home address listed.

The wireman was linked to an inflatable mattress in a box that contained a receipt with his name on it. The carpenter foreman's smartphone hot spot was connected to the TV's network. 

Additionally, the report said former complaints named the three men, the electric foreman was linked to the room in testimony and the wireman had actually confessed to the allegation before later recanting.

The wireman initially said that he and electric foreman had been in the room while receiving overtime pay, but denied it when confronted by investigators.

The electric foreman admitted that he had a copy of the locksmith shop keys, despite not having worked in that department between five and eight years ago.

The investigation began on August 8, 2019, after the MTA determining that Metro-North MTA officials did not probe two complaints about the man cave.

Subsequently, the new report has called for those officials to 'formalize how it tracks complaints the President’s Office' and accurately identify all rooms.

Railroad officials complained that the secret space was a potential fire hazard because rescue workers would have trouble navigating an unmapped room.  

Grand Central Terminal officials denied even knowing the room was there and was not sure which employees had access to the storage room. 

Investigators could not officially determine if the men had used the room while on the job, but based on the evidence it's likely they did.
