She's rumoured to lose out to Irena Srbinovska on The Bachelor finale. 

But Bella Varelis was all smiles as she stepped out to grab a coffee with co-star and housemate Bec Cvilikas in Sydney on Thursday. 

The 25-year-old stunned in a casual T-shirt and a tiny pair of matching shorts that showed off her trim pins.

The brunette beauty couldn't stop grinning as she carried the two coffees to the car where Bec was waiting for her. 

Possibly in a bid to fly under the radar, the aspiring influencer hid her famous face behind a pair of sunglasses.

Bella penned a heartfelt message to Locky Gilbert ahead of Thursday night's gripping season finale.

The message was released on The Bachelor's official Instagram account.

'Never in a million years did I think I would be stepping out of the limo that first night and meeting someone who I'd connect with on so many levels,' she wrote.

Bella said after a 'long' and 'incredible' journey, she can see herself with him, which she called 'simultaneously exciting and petrifying.'

'After a very long, incredible journey and seeing Locky with my loved ones, I have a full heart and I can definitely picture my life with him.'

She finished by saying that Bachelor has been a 'wild ride' and she is 'grateful' for what she has learnt along the way.

'Regardless of the outcome, this has been one heck of a wild ride and I'm so grateful for the beautiful people I've met along the way and everything I've learnt about myself.'

Fans are still guessing who will win Locky's heart. The two finalists are Bella and 31-year-old nurse Irena.

Paparazzi pictures have emerged that prove the brunette spent the night with former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro at the weekend.

One of Bella's neighbours in Sydney spotted Nathan's Toyota HiLux parked outside her home at about 8pm on Saturday night.

The following morning, at about 9:45am, a nervous-looking Nathan, 25, was pictured leaving the apartment and driving away.

While these photos aren't irrefutable proof that Bella and Nathan are dating - they could be just friends or he could be seeing Bec - they leave little doubt that Bella doesn't win Locky's heart.
