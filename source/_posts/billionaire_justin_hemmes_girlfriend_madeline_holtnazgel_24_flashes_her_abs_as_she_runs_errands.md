She has reportedly moved in with her billionaire boyfriend, Justin Hemmes.

And life was certainly good for the 48-year-old pub baron's much younger girlfriend Madeline Holtnazgel, 24, as she left his $2.1million beachfront apartment in Sydney's Coogee to run errands on Thursday.

The stunning model flashed her abs in a black sports bra before making a stylish outfit change for a night out with her friend, Indi Thew.

Madeline showed off her slender physique in the matching black two-piece set.

Her sports bra plunged down the middle, and the leggings featured white stripes down the side to accentuate her slender legs.

Her brunette locks were scraped back into a messy bun, and she added to her low-key look with a pair of shades.

The beauty was seen enjoying a lengthy phone call before picking up a smoothie with her blonde pal.

It proved to be an eventful day for Madeline, as she then made her way to her beau Justin's pub Coogee Pavilion.

Madeline embraced a rock-chic look in an off-the-shoulder black knit which was loosely tucked into a pair of high-waisted skinny black leather trousers.

She teamed the ensemble with grunge lace-up boots and wore her long locks undone while accessorising with gold earrings.

Her sighting comes after reports from The Daily Telegraph that she has moved in with Justin at his beachfront apartment in Sydney's Coogee.

The publication understands Justin purchased the three-bedroom property six years ago for $2.1million.

 It is also believed the father-of-two resides in his family's Vaucluse mansion, visiting Madeline at the Coogee abode.

Justin was spotted aboard his luxury jet Bombardier Challenger last Saturday, celebrating his birthday week with Madeline and several of their friends.

When asked about his new romance with the youthful stunner, a coy Justin told The Daily Telegraph: 'We hang out a bit.'

With her stunning features and her sizzling Instagram feed, it's no wonder Justin took a liking to Madeline - who is the younger sister of Australia's Next Top Model finalist Simone Holtznagel.

Madeline was one of the four models who was permitted by Justin to self-isolate during the COVID-19 pandemic at his $60million mansion in Sydney's Vaucluse.

The businessman himself stayed in the country at another of his properties with his two young daughters, Alexa, four, and Saachi, three.

Justin shares his two children with his ex-partner Kate Fowler, 29, who he announced he had split from in July 2018.

In August 2018, it was claimed Justin was dating a then-single Australia's Next Top Model star Montana Cox.

The brunette beauty denied the reports, telling The Sydney Morning Herald that they are 'just friends'.
