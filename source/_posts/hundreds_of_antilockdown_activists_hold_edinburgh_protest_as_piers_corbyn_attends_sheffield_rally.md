Hundreds of anti-lockdown activists held a huge protest against wearing face masks outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh this afternoon.

Around 600 coronavirus sceptics and vaccine conspiracy theorists gathered outside Hollyrood after Scotland saw its highest weekly rise in coronavirus cases since May. 

Meanwhile, Piers Corbyn attended an anti-lockdown protest in Sheffield today, less than a week after he was handed a £10,000 fine for organising a rally in London.

The older brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke at the protest in Sheffield city centre.

He was joined by anti-5G campaigner Mark Steele in the Sheffield Peace Gardens this afternoon, with South Yorkshire Police in attendance.

Professor Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, called the protesters outside Hollyrood 'deeply irresponsible'.

He told the BBC: 'I honestly do not understand it. I think it is irresponsible - do they think we're making it up? 194 counties are making up a viral pandemic.

'I would love to have not lived through the last six months, both in my job and what we have had to do to our country and many others. 

'I think it is deeply irresponsible.'

In the past seven days Scotland saw 994 confirmed cases of coronavirus, almost double the 507 new cases in the previous week.

The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 overall in Scotland now stands at 21,189 and the number of infected patients who have died remains at 2,496. 

The protest outside Hollyrood was organised by the Saving Scotland Facebook group. Protestors held signs reading 'fact not fear' and 'no masks in schools' as they marched through Edinburgh. 

A post on the Facebook group said it is 'time to stand up together, and listen to real scientific evidence in regards to the health of the Scottish people'.

Others at the rally held signs saying 'don't let them muzzle you' as Piers Corbyn addressed the crowd.

Last Saturday, the 73-year-old meteorologist led more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally in Trafalgar Square.

He was seen being hauled off by officers after the event and his Twitter account has since confirmed he was slapped with the colossal fine and 'held for ten hours.'

He was among eight other offenders who were fined across the rest of England under new lockdown measures imposed last week which are designed to stop gatherings of more than 30 people.

The hefty fine is now being wielded by police forces across the country to discourage people from meeting in groups of more than 30.

The arrest of Mr Corbyn in Trafalgar Square was the third time the divisive anti-lockdown campaigner has been arrested since the pandemic started. He was carted out of Hyde Park by officers on May 16 and May 30.

South Yorkshire Police have been approached for comment.
