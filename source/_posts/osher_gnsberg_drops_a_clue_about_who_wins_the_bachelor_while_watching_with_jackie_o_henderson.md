Jackie 'O' Henderson claims she knows a major clue about the who wins The Bachelor this year. 

Appearing on Tuesday's Kyle And Jackie O Show, the radio star, 45, explained that regularly watches The Bachelor with the show's own host Osher Günsberg via Zoom video conferences. 

'It's so fun, because obviously he knows who the winner is. But he's so good at not letting anything on to us,' she told co-host Kyle Sandilands. 

Jackie revealed that Osher even divulged the name of his favourite contestant during one of their weekly Zoom viewing parties. 

Also privy to the conversation were Jackie's fellow Masked Singer judges Urzula Carlson and Dannii Minogue . 

'I'm not going to say which contestant that [Osher] loves, but I do find it interesting that he has a favourite, that's all I say,' Jackie mused.

Intrigued, Kyle interjected: 'And he's told you?' 

'I asked him! I said, 'Who do you like on-set? Like who do you think is actually a cool, nice chick?' And he mentioned one, and I was like, 'Oh, that's interesting!'' Jackie enthused. 

However, Jackie chose not to divulge Osher's answer, explaining: 'I feel like he'll kill me.'

It comes after Osher publicly blasted Bella Varelis for her childish attitude on the show last week when she declared her friendship with Irena Srbinovska was 'over'. 

Appearing on the latest episode of the Cocktails and Roses podcast, which he presents with Bachelor alum Alisha Aitken-Radburn, the 46-year-old likened Bella's behaviour to that of a teenager.  

'This was straight out of a grade nine, little lunch conflict playbook. 'Friendship over' is something that you say right before the bell and you have to then go into P.E.' he said.  

Who could it be? Jackie chose not to divulge the name of Osher's favourite contestants this season, explaining: 'I feel like he'll kill me'  

'Come on, man. We're grown adults. You pay tax, you vote. Come on. No one says 'friendship over'.'

The women, who had been close friends earlier in the season, clashed because Irena had supposedly misled Bella about how often she was communicating with Locky Gilbert outside of the 'official' Zoom sessions. 

 The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
