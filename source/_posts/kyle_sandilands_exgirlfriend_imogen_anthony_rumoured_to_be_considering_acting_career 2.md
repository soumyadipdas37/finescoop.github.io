She's best known for being Kyle Sandilands' ex-girlfriend, but that could all be about to change for Imogen Anthony.

'Imogen is a creative. She is driven by creating art and expressing herself in many different forms. Animals, acting and fashion are just a few of her great loves,' a friend of the star told The Daily Telegraph. 

Imogen already has some acting experience under her belt, having briefly appeared in Fat Pizza vs Housos back in 2014.

She had a cameo in the film alongside her then-boyfriend Kyle, 49, with the former couple playing drunken bogans who end up in a fight.

At the time though, the focus was on Kyle's performance, with the film's director Paul Fenech telling The Sydney Morning Herald in November 2014 that the radio shock jock could have a career in comedy.

'He has a lot of potential for comedy acting. He's really easy to work with, unlike many others,' he said at the time.

But in a surefire sign that Imogen is the one looking for acting opportunities, she has a profile on casting website StarNow.

Her other skills include: 'Photographer, Dancer, Makeup Artist, Fashion Stylist, TV Presenter, Radio Presenter'.
