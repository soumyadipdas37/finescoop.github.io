'And then there were 3 #babybarker,' she wrote alongside a gallery of images of the couple on holiday.

The announcement came four months after Elyse and Josh bought a $2.3million beach house in Byron Bay.

Their new 1960s built property is located in the old part of Byron Bay town, just a short walk from the main beach and surrounded by tranquil greenery.

Last year, Elyse told Daily Mail Australia that the couple had moved to Byron Bay from Melbourne while chasing a more sustainable lifestyle for themselves.

Speaking at an event in September, the model explained she'd physically confront strangers that she would see littering in Victoria, before eventually leaving.

She explained: 'I just can't see it being left on the ground and when they're dropping rubbish, I think they need to be told off.'
