She recently left the world of reality television after an alleged affair came to light.

But Denise Richards was focused on brunch with her beau as she stepped out in Calabasas, Calif. with husband Aaron Phypers on Sunday. 

The 49-year-old actress sported a black tank top and jeans as she hopped on the back of a motorcycle outside of the Sagebrush Cantina days after quitting the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

The Bold and the Beautiful star showed off her summer tan in a spaghetti strap top with a matching black bra. 

She paired distressed denim with her signature chunky combat boots which featured a thick heel and bright white laces.

Denise kept her caramel colored hair swept to the side in a loose braid and wore minimal makeup to complement her flawless complexion.

Aaron was equally as laid back wearing a grey T-shirt and dark denim slacks, with a navy blue baseball cap covering his brunette hair.

The pair — who recently celebrated their second wedding anniversary — pounded the pavement through the parking lot with a few friends before hopping on their motorcycle for a Sunday ride.

Denise appeared to be relatively care-free just days after departing RHOBH following a season full of accusations involving former castmate Brandi Glanville.

Just the two of us: Fans on social media wondered whether or not she was in an 'open marriage' with Phypers, but Denise insisted in February that she is '100% monogamous to [her] husband'

Richards spent the better part of Season 10 denying an affair with Brandi despite a host of text messages seemingly confirming their interactions. 

Fans on social media wondered whether or not she was in an 'open marriage' with Phypers, but Denise insisted in February that she is '100% monogamous to [her] husband.' 

Glanville, who left the Bravo program in 2015, doubled down on her side of the story when confirming their relationship to US Weekly. 

'If I was just doing it to make a splash, why would I not have done it last season? Then they would have brought me back full-time this season because they would have had a giant full f**king story line,' she explained. 

'I didn't say it last season because I was worried that I was a cheater after she's like, 'Oh, Aaron's going to kill me if he finds out.' I thought, 'What is she talking about?' That is bullsh*t.' 

The drama surrounding Richards' love life ramped up the series' ratings in season 10, with the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills becoming the 'top-rated cable program on Wednesday nights,' according to Variety.
