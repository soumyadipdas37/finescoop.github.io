The first day of school has officially begun for Sarah Michelle Gellar and her children, who are continuing their studies at home in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus.

But already the Buffy The Vampire Slayer has sent a plea for help.

Sarah, 43, jokingly asked for assistance from fans as she documented her first day of homeschooling on Wednesday, which was riddled with problems.

'In case anyone was wondering how the first day went... the fire alarm started going off ten minutes in ... and no ladder we had was tall enough to reach... so seems about right for 2020 #sendhelp #homeschool #teachersareheroes,' she wrote.

In the video, Sarah stood in her living room holding onto two signs announcing her children's first day of school in quarantine.

'Send help,' Sarah whispered to the camera. 

Sarah and her husband Freddie Prinze Jr. share daughter Charlotte, 10, and son Rocky, eight, together.

The couple celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary on Tuesday, and Sarah marked the occasion with two black-and-white snaps from their special day.  

'You... are my favorite husband #happyanniversary,' she captioned the sweet snaps.

Sarah and Freddie, 44, tied the knot in Mexico just two years after they first started dating.

The couple both starred in the hit 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer before becoming romantically involved in real life.

Now, nearly 20 years later, the couple are parents of two.

Sarah and her husband welcomed daughter Charlotte in 2009, followed by son Rocky in 2012. 

The stars were friends for two years before becoming romantic, which Freddie credits their thriving, long-lasting relationship to.

'We just became friends. It's one of the reasons I think our relationship has always been so good,' he told E! in 2017. 'We were friends for a good two years before we ever went on a date. She knew what kind of guy I was, she knew what my morals were, my priorities were, and vice versa.'

Though they were opposites, Freddie said that ended up working to their favor.

'Neither one of us would have ever - if you ask her, she would have been like, "Oh my God, I thought he was a dork." And I'd be like, "Oh my gosh, she just ran a million miles an hour and I couldn't keep up with her."

'We ended up being the perfect balance, you know what I mean? But it didn't happen until years after, and there was a solid foundation built, and that's probably the main reason why we've always been cool and grooving.'
