Little Mix have reportedly made a staggering £28.5million since winning The X Factor back in 2011. 

The band- Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jesy Nelson and Perrie Edwards- made a £938,827 profit last year, despite not releasing a record, The Sun reports. 

In the latest accounts from their firm Eternal Dance, the near £1million boost brings the net worth of their company to £4,870,417.

The healthy sum comes as the band have just released their new album Confetti, which should add to their growing money pot. 

And with the launch of their BBC show Little Mix: The Search in the hunt to find the perfect band to tour with them, the quartets' finances should be on the up. 

Back in July it was reported that Jesy, Jade and Perrie banked a whopping £700,000 in the past year, after the millions they raked in for their tour.

The girls- minus Leigh-Anne- all set up private companies registered in their first and second names. 

The Sun reports Companies House show Jade, 27, was the top earner, with her firm banking £312,959 in accounts dated 31 March 2020.

Meanwhile, Perrie, 27, made a profit of £179,508 after deductions were made for bills of her £239,945 she banked for her company Perrie Louise. 

Good work: The healthy sum comes as the band have just released their new album Confetti, which should add to their growing money pot

Jesy, 29, made a £91,209 profit after banking £144,623. 

Collectively, the firms, set up in 2018, brought in £700,000 over the past year but £200,000 of that had to be used to pay bills.  

It comes after Jade admitted that Little Mix were 'scared of p***ing anyone off' at the start of their career and that they did 'what we were told'.

The Holiday hitmaker candidly discussed the group's journey in a new interview with Radio Times.

Little Mix, who switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018, were originally formed on The X Factor in 2011.

'At the beginning we were so scared of p***ing anyone off and damaging our career, so we did what we were told,' she said. 

'We didn't even realise we had a choice, it was pitched as not having one, so you sign what you are told to and you go along with it. As the years went on, we started to realise we didn't like that.' 

Jade recalled how in one meeting she tried to reach a compromise with 'one of the head guys' and she was shot down.

Claims: The singer also claimed that the music industry is 'very much dominated by older men' (pictured in 2019) 

She said: 'I left that meeting crying my eyes out and ringing my mum. It took a while to be like, "Actually, f*** you. I'm just as entitled to an opinion as you are.''   

Jade added since the band has started saying 'no' a weight has been shifted and that they used to feel 'intimidated' by the music industry but not anymore.

Little Mix switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018 amid claims of a feud.  

At the time, Simon insisted he 'never fell out' with the group and that tensions between himself and Little Mix's management, Modest Management, led to an 'embarrassing row' over a songwriting credit for their new track Woman Like Me. 

The music mogul even branded the girls 'the hardest working bunch' he has ever worked with.
