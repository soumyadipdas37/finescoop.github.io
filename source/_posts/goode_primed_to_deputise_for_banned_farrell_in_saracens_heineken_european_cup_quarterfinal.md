Alex Goode is primed to deputise for the banned Owen Farrell in Saracens’ No 10 shirt against Leinster on Saturday and he will relish the added responsibility — even if it makes his mother uneasy.

The 32-year-old former England full-back is set to fill in at fly-half for the holders in their momentous Heineken European Cup quarter-final in Dublin, in the enforced absence of the England captain. Goode is not fazed by the prospect of a head-to-head with Irish Lion Jonny Sexton, but it is causing parental jitters.

‘I enjoy it more than my Mum does,’ he said of operating at No 10, as he did in last year’s quarter-final win over Glasgow. ‘My mum doesn’t like me getting tackled. She gets nervous about me getting injured, she doesn’t like me goal-kicking — she’d rather I was on the bench!

‘Naturally, as someone who plays that position, you have to enjoy the pressure. If I didn’t enjoy it, I’d be in the wrong job. I do enjoy it.’

Reflecting on filling the void left by Farrell, Goode added: ‘They’re pretty hard shoes to fill. You can’t compare anyone to Owen. He’s a special player who plays his own way, but it’s a team that isn’t built around one person.’

The fixture is a major focus for Saracens as they seek to claim another European triumph before accepting relegation from the Premiership.

‘We are the last team to beat them (Leinster) and we hope that it sits in their minds. We don’t want to give up our title easily,’ Goode said.
