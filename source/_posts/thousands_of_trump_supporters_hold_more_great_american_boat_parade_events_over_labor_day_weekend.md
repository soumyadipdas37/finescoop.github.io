Hoards of flag-waving President Trump supporters sailed into the waters again on Sunday for a series of boat parades after several vessels sunk and were capsized in Texas. 

Labor Day Weekend in the United States this year comes just three months before the highly polarized presidential election in November, and a number of conservatives have lifted their anchors to show their support for President Trump.

At least nine cities across the country, from California to Georgia and back again, hosted Great American Boat Parade events to herald the current Commander-in-Chief for a second term.

Just one day before, officials said that five boats sank during a Trump boat parade at Lake Travis, Texas, amid a flurry of distress calls. 

Lake Travis, a reservoir on the Colorado River, is known for its hazardous sailing conditions at times and has been the site of dozens of boating accidents over the years. No injuries or deaths were reported. 

At least nine cities across the United States held Trump Boat Parades on Sunday to draw up support for the current Commander-in-Chief ahead of the presidential election in November

Thousands of 'Keep America Great Again' supporters participated in the Great American Boat Parade at Lake Lanier on Sunday.

Organizers said that around around 700 vessels participated in the event, but the Georgia Department of Natural Resources estimated that almost 4,000 people showed up. 

Georgia DNR Game Warden Kevin Goss told 11 Alive that the surprising number includes spectator boats as well. The agency will get a more exact count after they review aerial images.

Luckily, the waters on Sunday were fairly calm and Goss said no issues were reported.

'It went really smooth, we haven't received any reports of boats sinking or swamping or getting turned over,' he said. 

Organizers of Georgia's Great American Boat Parade said the event was meant to show support for 'the leadership of this great nation' and first responders.

Although the Georgia Department of Natural Resources estimated around 4,000 participants, organizers said they only counted roughly 700 boats during the event

'Let's come together as Brothers and Sisters and celebrate these very freedoms,' the group wrote on the Facebook event page. 

Elaine Hill, a local resident, heard about the event and ventured out to see the inaugural event. 

'They're out here doing something they enjoy and they're not hurting anybody,' said Hill. 'They're just peaceful people for Trump.'

Goss said participants at the Lake Lanier boat parade followed local rules and the county never contacted the agency. In addition to the George DNR, agencies from Hall, Forsyth Gwinnett County were there.

Further north, a similar event was held by organizers in the Potomac River when hundreds of boars arrived on Sunday afternoon

Stephanie Christacos, who helped organize the event, told WUSA 9 that their Great American Boat Parade was meant to create excitement around Trump's 2020 bid.

'It's all grassroots, I'm just a mom,' said Christacos. 'I love our country, and I want to be safe. And I believe that's President Donald Trump.'

The boat party, or the 'Trumptilla', began the journey from the Old Dominion Boat Club in Alexandria and then headed for the Memorial bridge.

'The enthusiasm is off the charts,' said organizer Mae Snow.

The organizers, including Carole Berman, said the President has their unwavering support in spite of the anti-military statements her reportedly made about veterans or polls that label Biden the front runner.

'I've never been polled. I've never been polled. I've never been. I don't believe in the polls and I don't think most people do,' they said.

More importantly, Christakos said, people need to get out and vote for the November election.

'Everybody has to get out to vote. Get out to vote, do not sit home,' she added.

 One participant, Art Barletta, told WUSA 9 that he voted for Republicans in 2016 and felt is was important to show support for the party.

He admitted, however, that Trump had not made good on all his promises.

'Campaign promises never come to reality all the time,' said Barletta, who added that he still believed Trump should get a second term.

'He needs to unite the country. He needs to get equality for everybody. He needs to get equality for everybody that's not been born yet,' said Barletta. 

Hundreds of Trump supporters sailing through the waters were also spotted at Pennsylvania's Lake Erie.

'It just shows a lot of love for America's values and our love for our president and our support,' said Adam Stanzzyk, a person who attended on Sunday.

According to Your Erie, this particular event was organized by a 19-year-old student from Gannon University who wished to stay anonymous due to death threats.

The Great American Boat Parade was met with some protesters who opposed the event, but no reports of confrontations or altercations were made

The boats gathered at Presque Isle before navigating to Dobbins Landing just 10 miles away.

One person visiting Lake Eria said the amount of boats sailing was shockig.

'Seventy five boats more boats have shown up and I think about 95% of them have Trump flags on them so that's pretty cool. Great show of support for our president. There really is a silent majority out here,' said Mark Webb.

Erie County Councilman Brian Shank, a local conservative politician, welcomed Trump supporters and others to the event.

Shank: 'Put a thing on Facebook and said hey we got a boat parade coming in we want to come out and show our support for the folks out on the water'

'Put a thing on Facebook and said hey we got a boat parade coming in we want to come out and show our support for the folks out on the water,' said Shank.

'So we got together a couple of friends. It's a beautiful day and is what freedom is all about.'

A small group of counter-protesters arrived to the event, resulting in a back and forth with Trump supporters. 

Shank said that the difference in opinion is what makes the country great.

'That's what makes America great. We're allowed to have a difference of opinion.'

A Great American Boat Parade was also held near the Owensboro Riverfront of the Ohio River.

Those organizers said that in addition to supporting Trump, the event allowed Indiana and Kentucky boaters social time during the pandemic.
