Tie-up talks: The potential deal could see the pair combine their life insurance, pensions and asset management divisions

It would mean that LV=, better known as Liverpool Victoria, would end its 177-year run as an independent business. 

The two companies could form a 'mutuals champion' boasting some 10m UK customers, sources told Sky News. 

Royal London is Britain's largest mutual insurer. 

Private equity firm Bain Capital is seen as a potential rival bidder for LV=, which is thought to be worth between £500m and £1billion.
