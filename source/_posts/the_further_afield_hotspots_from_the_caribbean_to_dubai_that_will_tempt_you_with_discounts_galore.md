Having something to look forward to is what we all need right now. And, despite our summer holidays being all but ruined, long-haul trips later this year and into next year look like a much safer bet — and there are some astonishing deals.

Book with a package holiday provider, such as the ones we suggest below, and you’ll be guaranteed a refund or the opportunity to re-book should a coronavirus outbreak happen either here or abroad. 

Many of these countries have few cases and are welcoming tourists with open arms.

Caribbean

Travel restrictions can vary between islands in the Caribbean. A seven-night holiday to Secrets St. Martin Resort & Spa on the island of St Martin, pictured, starts from £1,998 on selected dates in December

Caribbean islands make up a large proportion of long-haul destinations on the Foreign Office’s quarantine-free list. They include the Bahamas, BVIs, Bermuda, Barbados, Antigua, Turks and Caicos, St Lucia, St Barts, Jamaica and St Vincent and the Grenadines.

Restrictions vary between islands. The Cayman Islands, which is also on the list and will open to international tourism on September 1, is asking visitors to wear coin-sized ‘biobuttons’ which will ‘passively monitor incoming travellers for early symptoms’ and provide proof of a negative test.

Other islands require tourists to fill out questionnaires, obtain visas or bring thermometers with them so they can report their temperatures twice daily to the authorities.

BA announced last week that it will launch a new route between Gatwick and Jamaica from October 13.

The deals

Seychelles

Holidaymakers can enjoy seven nights at the Six Senses Zil Pasyon in the Seychelles, pictured, in December from £4,695 -  a saving of 30 per cent

The Seychelles is a cluster of 115 tropical East African islands. Pictured is the spa at the Six Senses Zil Pasyon

This cluster of 115 tropical East African islands is reopening to international tourism from today (August 1). 

However, travellers are permitted only from low and medium-risk countries (the UK is currently listed as high risk). Visitors from medium-risk countries require proof of a negative test. 

The Seychelles has had no deaths and is on the FCO quarantine-free list. The best times to visit are April, May, October and November when trade winds are calmest.

The deals

Maldives

The Maldives has been open to international tourists since July 15. Most of the resorts will be open in October - in time for the high season. There is a five-night deal going for Cocoon Maldives, pictured, with a saving of 39 per cent

The honeymoon islands began welcoming international tourists on July 15. Visitors will have their temperature checked on arrival and will need to register a confirmed booking at one of the Maldives’ 156 resorts, of which 43 have reopened, with the tourism board.

Most of the resorts will be open in October — just in time for the high season, when the weather is at its best. The Maldives, which has had 15 deaths, is not on the FCO quarantine-free list but is likely to be added in the coming weeks.

The deals 

Thailand

Thailand has only had 58 deaths from coronavirus and is opening up to international tourists from today. Pictured is Railay beach in Krabi 

The country is opening up its glittering temples and tropical beaches to international tourists from today (August 1). 

Thailand has had only 58 deaths and no locally transmitted cases in 50 days. Thailand is not on the FCO’s quarantine-free list but is exempt from its ‘all but essential travel’ advice.

The deals 

Dubai

Tourists visiting Dubai, pictured, must show proof of a negative coronavirus test on arrival or undergo a test at the airport

International tourists have been welcome since July 7. Visitors must show proof of a negative test on arrival, or carry out a test at the airport, and register their details in the COVID-19 DXB app. 

Arrivals will also have their temperature taken with thermal screening devices. 

Bask in the warmth of Dubai’s desert-like climate from November to March — but avoid the peak of the heat.

The deals 

Mauritius

Mauritius is one of the countries on the FCO's quarantine-free list. Pictured is the beach at Trou aux Biches 

The far-flung Indian Ocean island nation is on the FCO’s quarantine-free list and the WHO’s green list, having had only three cases since May 11. 

Mauritius will begin opening up to international tourists in the coming months once construction of a lab at the airport has been completed.

The deals

All prices include flights and transfers. 

No-go countries

Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, USA, Brazil, India, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Indonesia.
