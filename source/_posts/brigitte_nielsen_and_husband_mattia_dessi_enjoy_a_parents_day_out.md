They share a precious two-year-old daughter named Frida.

But Brigitte Nielsen and her husband Mattia Dessi enjoyed some quality time just with each other on Saturday - and their two dogs.

Brigitte, 57, and Mattia, 41, were spotted shopping in Beverly Hills with their four-legged friends scampering by their side.

Parents' day out! Brigitte Nielsen and her husband Mattia Dessi enjoyed some quality time just with each other in Beverly Hills on Saturday

Even in the midst of a pandemic, Brigitte and her beau were dressed to impress.

The star wore a white V-neck tank, slimming black Capris, and a pair of white strappy sandals.

She carried a blue water bottle and slung a chic white purse over her shoulder.

Mattia exuded cool in olive green joggers, a white T-shirt, and stylish sneakers.

In addition to their stylish ensembles, the couple took precautions against COVID-19 with their matching disposable face mask.

Not pictured with the couple that day was their toddler Frida, whom is often seen out with her parents.

Brigitte was able to give birth to her daughter aged 54 thanks to her foresight to have her eggs frozen when she was 40.

'If you don’t want to use [donor] eggs, you have to preserve your own eggs at a reasonable age for there to be a possibility,' she explained to People shortly after welcoming little Frida.

She also spoke to The Guardian in February of last year about having a child in middle age.

'I was always like: I want to do it until there are no more embryos left,' said Nielsen. 'Somebody has to win the lottery. 

'You're on a lot of medication. It is very expensive. Hormones will do different things to different women... you always think you're going to get pregnant, but most of the time, the phone call comes and it's: I'm sorry.

'It is devastating,' she added. 'The partner you're with has to be onboard as much as you, unless you're a woman who wants to have a baby on your own. You have to stay realistic and, if you're older, the odds are against you.'
