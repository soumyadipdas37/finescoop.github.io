Billi and Andy have been together for many years, and became engaged nearly six years ago when he got down on one knee in Rome, Italy.

While nothing appears to have been arranged, the blonde had previously revealed that the couple were planning to wed in the summer of 2017.

Speaking to OK! magazine at the time, she said: 'I wanted to spend a few months enjoying Arlo as a baby before we started getting busy with wedding stuff. I definitely want a massive wedding, though.'
