David Tennant has been voted the best Doctor Who by fans, in a poll released by Radio Times on Sunday.

The actor, 49, originally took on the role of the 10th Doctor in the iconic sci-fi series between 2005 and 2010, but is still a stalwart favourite.

Earning a grand total of 10,518 votes, David beat current star Jodie Whittaker to the top spot by just 95 votes, as she won 10, 423 votes.

Peter Capaldi, who was the last Doctor to star during Steven Moffat's tenure as showrunner, was given third place with 8,897 votes.

Matt Smith was next in the poll after gaining 7,637 votes, while of the new era of Doctor Who Christopher Eccleston came in at eighth place with just 1,144 votes.

Close second: Earning a grand total of 10,518 votes, David beat current star Jodie (pictured) to the top spot by just 95 votes, as she won 10, 423 vote

Third place: Peter Capaldi, who was the last Doctor to star during Steven Moffat's tenure as showrunner, was given third place with 8,897 votes

Peter Davison, who played the part from 1981 to 1984, came in last at 13th place, and he is also David's father-in-law as the actor is married to Peter's daughter Georgia.

The Scottish star met his wife Georgia on the show when she appeared in 2008 episode The Doctor's Daughter. 

David and Peter appeared on screen together as the fifth and tenth incarnations of the time-travelling alien in the 2007 mini-episode Time Crash, which aired as part of Children In Need.

The pair wed in 2011 and share children Olive, nine, Wilfred, seven, and Doris, five, and Birdie, eleven months, and David adopted Georgia's 18-year-old son Ty when they married. 

Huw Fullerton, sci-fi and fantasy editor of Radio Times said of the poll: 'Over a decade after he left the TARDIS behind and after nearly 50,000 votes were cast, it's clear David Tennant is still Doctor Who fans' perfect 10.

But with Jodie Whittaker hot on his heels and a great showing for other recent Doctors like Peter Capaldi, it looks like the fans also hold other Time Lords close to their hearts.' 

Finishing on a nail-biting cliffhanger, Doctor Who's eagerly-awaited return will be for a festive special, it was announced in March.

2. Jodie Whittaker - 10,423

3. Peter Capaldi - 8,897

With the fate of the Doctor hanging in the balance amid the Great CyberWar and return of The Master at the end of Series 12, fans will have to wait until December to see how the action unfolds.   

The identity of the Timeless Child was finally revealed, throwing everything fans know about the Doctor into question.

Jodie will be back as the near-immortal Time Lord in the upcoming festive episode curiously titled Revolution of the Daleks.

This can only mean that the Doctor's biggest and most feared enemies, the Daleks, will be front and centre in shaping the next series, set to be Jodie's last.

Showrunner Chris Chibnall said at the time: 'We can't leave the Doctor there! On that cliffhanger! Well, we did.

'But rest assured, the Doctor and her friends will be back for a one-off extended Special around Christmas and New Year. (I don't know when they're going to put it on yet, otherwise we'd tell you!).

'There will be Daleks. There will be exterminations. Thrills, laughter, tears. You know. The usual. See you at the end of the year.' 

Producers also confirmed Tosin Cole, who plays Ryan, Bradley Walsh's Graham, and Yaz played by Mandip Gill will all be returning for the festive episode.

The original: William Hartnell (centre), who was the first actor to play the Time Lord in 1963, came in sixth place for 1,983 votes

Not bad: Peter Davison, who played the part from 1981 to 1984, came in last at 13th place, and he is also David's father-in-law as the actor is married to Peter's daughter Georgia
