 She welcomed her beloved baby girl in December 2019.

And Rachel Riley was every inch the devoted mother as she stepped out with daughter Maven and husband Pasha Kovalev after Countdown filming in Salford on Wednesday.

The blonde beauty, 34, looked happier than ever as she smiled with Maven, nine months, in a leopard print sling on her chest.

Rachel looked stylish in a white crochet jumper paired with black jeans and silver sandals as she stepped out pushing a pram.

Her blonde tresses were styled in soft waves while her pretty features were enhanced with a rich palette of make-up. 

Maven matched her mum in a white babygro and sandals. 

Former Strictly dancer Pasha, 40, looked casual cool in a black jacket, tee and shorts as he wheeled the suitcases.

Rachel, Pasha and Maven have spent lockdown with her Russian mother-in-law Galina, whose month-long visit to the UK was extended amid the pandemic.   

The couple, who became first-time parents to Maven in December, have been enjoyed extended time off at home amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Speaking on Heart Breakfast with Jamie Theakston and Lucy Horobin, the blonde recently admitted the countrywide lockdown has been something of a blessing for the family as they have been given 'enforced maternity and paternity leave'.

The Oxford University alum said: 'Well we're quite fortunate in a way, I was supposed to be back at work, Pasha was supposed to be on tour, and it's kind of enforced maternity and paternity leave we didn't have before so we're loving it.

'She's just over five months, I've left her in bed in kind of the same sleeping position as Pash, if you hear crying it could be either one of them I have no idea.'

Rachel's appearance came after she revealed she came to the aid of one of her friends suffering domestic abuse, after learning of her plight during lockdown.

 The media personality spoke out as she got candid about the abuse so many more women are experiencing behind closed doors.

She told The Mirror: 'I've been supporting a friend who I didn't know was in a situation of domestic violence for some years. While I can't go into specifics, I know COVID has made things more difficult.

'It's been so hard for women in her situation, without direct access to support services. I saw a poster that said 'Domestic abusers have always worked from home' and that's so true.

'There's no outlet currently. People are trapped at home, the kids aren't at school and police and social services are running a limited service.'
