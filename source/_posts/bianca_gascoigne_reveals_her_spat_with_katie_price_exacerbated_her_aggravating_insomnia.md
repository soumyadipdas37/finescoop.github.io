Bianca Gascoigne has revealed her explosive row with boyfriend Kris Boyson's ex Katie Price caused her anxiety and insomnia.

The step-daughter of Paul Gascoigne, 33, spoke on Tuesday's edition of Steph's Packed Lunch on Channel 4, where she detailed how the spat impacted her and exacerbated her problems with sleeping. 

Speaking to Dr Javid Abdelmoneim, she said: 'So I think I just felt really powerless and it was really making me anxious and I just didn't know what was going to come out next. It's aggravating as you want to have a peaceful night's sleep.'

Tough times: Bianca Gascoigne has revealed her explosive row with boyfriend Kris Boyson's ex Katie Price caused her anxiety and insomnia

Bianca spoke to Steph and Dr Javid about how she has been feeling of late and how lockdown and the row impacted her mental health. 

Bianca and Kris confirmed their relationship in April - four months after he split from Katie following a turbulent two-year romance before rows broke out in June. 

It was alleged at the time that Katie was reported to police for 'trying to force her way into their home' and was allegedly shouting and screaming and tried to get inside the property just days after Bianca moved in.

Bianca was not home at the time but is said to be 'feeling threatened' days after Katie tried to warn her off dating her personal trainer ex, 31.

Katie later warned love rival Bianca off Kris and accused her ex of still messaging her and doubled down on her comments in an interview with new! magazine.

The mother-of-five claimed that Kris had been 'playing' them, as he had told Katie he was single, three days before his relationship with Bianca came to light.

Katie recalled: 'He told me he wasn't seeing anyone and was single - we talked about getting married, babies, starting again. In my opinion they were false promises... There have been a lot of mixed messages.'

Following the painful row, Katie has detailed how the argument has impacted her.  

She said: 'There were a lot of lies coming out. I couldn't fight my corner because I didn't want to bite to it. Obviously I wanted to say what was really true and be like 'it's all lies' and everything like that...

'So I think I just felt really powerless and it was really making me anxious and I just didn't know what was going to come out next. It's aggravating as you want to have a peaceful night's sleep.'

In a candid video filmed during the night, Bianca described her insomnia: 'It's 4am, I'm fed up, I just want it sorted. I'm just wearing myself out....

'It's annoying when you wake up and you feel still so tired and you're wide awake and all you can't do is sleep, and it's all you want to do.'

Bianca told Dr Javid: 'I'm a very light sleeper, I'm watching TV, I'm checking my phone before going to bed. I'm waking up say about 4 o'clock, I'm wide awake and it's frustrating. I can be a short with people, a bit snappy and that's just not me at all.'

The duo were talking as part of a recurring strand on Steph's Packed Lunch, Celebrity Surgery, in which the show's resident doctors help celebrity patients.

Steph's Packed Lunch contacted Katie Price's representatives about Bianca's comments. A spokesperson said: 'Katie wished the couple all the best a few months ago - there is nothing further to add.'
