Hector Bellerin was slammed by Arsenal fans for taking two foul throws in the Gunners' defeat by Liverpool on Monday - despite the right-back's best protests about his technique.

The Spanish defender was penalised twice for incorrectly throwing the ball back onto the Anfield pitch as the north Londoners dropped their first points of the Premier League season at the home of the champions. 

After giving away the second foul throw, Bellerin pleaded his innocence with the linesman and vocally admitted he had been committing foul throws for his whole career.

The Gunners full-back admitted he had been using that throw-in technique all his career

The right-back bellowed at the official: 'How? I've done that my whole life!' as the Gunners chased down Liverpool's lead during the second-half. 

Supporters on social media were quick to notice Bellerin's error of judgement during Monday night's Merseyside showdown, with one fan even suggesting he work on his technique. 

One fan tweeted: 'Bellerin needs throw-in practice. 2 foul throws but counted several more he got away with. Like a wet cloth throwing it.'

Liverpool are famed for having their own throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark, while Arsenal have recently hired a set piece coach, Andreas Georgson, who was formerly at fellow London side Brentford. 





Supporters mocked Bellerin on social media for the multiple foul throws on Monday night

Another fan said on social media: 'A foul throw at any level is embarrassing , at pro level it’s a joke!! Bellerin has done it 4 times tonight and been pulled up for it twice! Shocking!'

One fan claimed the Arsenal defender was playing at an amateur level, saying: 'Someone needs to teach Bellerin how to take a throw in. Two foul throws in 1 game. Unbelievable scenes Jeff. Don’t even get that on Sunday league.'

A fourth fan said: 'Bellerin just did a foul throw. One of the most humiliating things you can get pulled on as a full back!'

Bellerin's side did all they could to try and stifle Liverpool at Anfield but Jurgen Klopp's side were just too strong for the north London club on Monday night.

The Gunners did show some promise and Mikel Arteta's side took the lead in the first-half as Alexandre Lacazette finished off a fine team move with a scuffed finish over Alisson Becker. 

But Liverpool turned the tide before half-time as goals from Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson inside the penalty area gave the Reds the lead at the break.

Substitute Diogo Jota marked his first Premier League appearance for Liverpool with a match-sealing goal late on.
