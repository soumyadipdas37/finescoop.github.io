Three months after celebrating their two-year anniversary, Dylan Sprouse and his  girlfriend Barbara Palvin enjoyed a night out with friends in Manhattan's Chinatown. 

While flocking to a trendy Southeast Asian restaurant on Saturday, the 28-year-old actor could be seen sporting a red and black flannel jacket lined with sheepskin. 

Meanwhile, Palvin, 26, nailed off-duty model chic as she stepped out in a black leather jacket and her brunette locks cascading down her shoulders.

As she strutted around in a pair of pristine white sneakers, the Victoria's Secret Angel kept her blue surgical mask resting under her chin.  

Both Sprouse and his male pal were more adherent to NYC's mask mandate, which requires people to wear a well-secured cloth covering or disposable mask in public. 

While standing together on the sidewalk, the lovebirds engaged in some lively conversation, before the former child star caught up with another friend.

Dylan revealed how he first connected with Barbara during a 2019 interview with W Magazine where he admitted he was bold enough to slide into her DMs. 

'I was like, "Hey, I don't know if you're in New York for very long, but we should hang out if you want to. Here's my number,"' he recalled. 'And she didn't message me for six months.'

Palvin explained by saying she wasn't in the right place for a relationship at that time.

'I knew I wasn't in a good mind-set at the time, and maybe deep inside I knew that it could be something more,' she confessed.

The pair are currently quarantining together in NYC.  

And though a stressful time, Dylan recently told Entertainment Tonight that they've been enjoying their quality time.  

How it all began: Dylan revealed how he first connected with Barbara during a 2019 interview with W Magazine where he admitted he was bold enough to slide into her DMs 

'I'm with my girlfriend, Barbara, and we're out in New York City, out here in the epicenter of the virus, but we're remaining completely indoors as much as humanly possible.' 

The star continued, 'In a way, despite the circumstances, it's actually pretty nice considering that we fly around all the time throughout the world and haven't had this much time to spend with each other in a long time.'

Professionally, Sprouse is keeping busy. He currently has three projects - the films After We Collided, Turandot, and Tyger Tyger - in post-production.
