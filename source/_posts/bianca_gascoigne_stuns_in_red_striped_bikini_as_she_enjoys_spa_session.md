She recently returned from Croatia following her first holiday with boyfriend Kris Boyson.

And Bianca Gascoigne treated herself to some more relaxation as she enjoyed a spa session at Ye Olde Bell Hotel in Retford over the weekend.

The glamour model, 33, took to Instagram to upload sizzling images of herself sporting a red striped bikini by Bahimi.

Flaunting her incredibly toned midsection, the CBB star stunned in the stunning two-piece, which featured a halterneck bralet and matching bottoms.

The adopted daughter of former footballer Paul Gascoigne ensured focus remained on her killer figure by opting for very minimal accessories during her Sabbia Med treatment.

Still managing to inject her signature glamour into her appearance, Bianca wore her tresses in loose waves and complemented her features with matte make-up.

The blonde beauty recently revealed she moved in with her personal trainer beau, 31, after their first date in a interview. 

The couple took their relationship to the next level as they spent the UK's nationwide lockdown together just weeks after embarking on a romance. 

Despite dating for only five months, the reality stars admitted they'd definitely want to get married and start a family in the future as they 'completely trust' each other.

Katie Price's ex told new! magazine: 'We've spent every single day together practically since we met. You wouldn't lock down with someone for 100 days if it was a showmance.' 

Bianca and Kris were introduced to each other three years ago when he provided her with healthy meals in preparation of a charity fight, which got cancelled when her opponent, his ex Katie Price, pulled out.

They lost contact for a while, before fitness enthusiast Kris slid into her Instagram DMs earlier this year. 

The couple currently reside in Kent and are renovating their pad with a cinema room and a new bar.
