Kevin Spacey was seen for the first time in months on Thursday, cycling around London - and wearing a wedding ring.

The shamed actor, 61, was last spotted in public in May, having kept a very low profile recently following claims he sexually assaulted actor Antony Rapp, who was 14 at the time.

But Kevin - who was then hit by over 30 additional accusations by other men about his predatory advances - tried to get some exercise in the English capital, flashing the steel band on his wedding finger as he rode.

The American Beauty actor is not known to be in a relationship, having remained cagey about his sexual orientation for years, until the allegations from Rapp forced him to come out as gay in 2017.

He has never been married and is known for his lack of a romantic partner throughout his years in the limelight.

Kevin wore a blue zip jacket over Lycra black leggings, and added sporty cycling shoes to his get-up.

He wore a grey woolly hat and aviator shades as he cycled along the sunny north London road.

Charges against Spacey were later dropped, after he strenuously denied them.

Spacey said he did not remember such an encounter with Rapp but apologised if the allegations were true.

Earlier this year he compared the ordeal to the coronavirus pandemic, and complained about losing his job following the accusations.

Caught on camera: Spacey described his 'painful' journey three years after he was accused of assault by a string of men and said he could relate to workers who've being laid off during the pandemic

Spacey, who made the comments in an interview for the Bits & Pretzels podcast, said: 'I don't think it will come as a surprise for anyone to say that my world completely changed in the fall of 2017.

'My job, many of my relationships, my standing in my own industry were all gone in just a matter of hours.' 

Not only did he get fired from Netflix hit House Of Cards, he was also removed from the completed movie All The Money In The World, which was reshot with actor Christopher Plummer in his role.

Spacey was asked during the podcast to reflect on the current coronavirus pandemic causing global and widespread devastation.  

The actor, who has not appeared in a professional movie or series since the accusations were made, said:  'I don't often like to tell people that I can relate to their situation because I think it undermines the experience that they may be having which is their own unique and very personal experience.' 

Taking the air: Other than this outing, he has only been seen earlier in the summer in a park walking his dog

He said: 'I don't often like to tell people that I can relate to their situation because I think it undermines the experience that they may be having which is their own unique and very personal experience'

Spacey added: 'But in this instance I feel as though I can relate to what it feels like to have your world suddenly stop.

'And so while we may have found ourselves in similar situations, albeit for very different reasons and circumstances, I still believe that some of the emotional struggles are very much the same.

'And so I do have empathy for what it feels like to suddenly be told that you can't go back to work or that you might lose your job and that it's a situation that you have absolutely no control over.'

Oh dear! Adding to the former House Of Cards actor's woes, a photo was released in July of him with Ghislaine Maxwell sitting on the Queen and Prince Philip 's Coronation thrones during a private Buckingham Palace tour organised by Prince Andrew

Bad to worse! A photo obtained by the Telegraph appeared to show the pair reclining in the thrones in 2002

Another day, another drama: The apparently lighthearted image has taken on new significance following Maxwell's arrest over the summer, with some suggesting it alludes to the close friendship between Maxwell and Prince Andrew

Adding to the former House Of Cards actor's woes, a photo was released in July of him with Ghislaine Maxwell  sitting on the Queen and Prince Philip's Coronation thrones during a private Buckingham Palace tour organised by Prince Andrew.

A photo obtained by the Telegraph appeared to show the pair reclining in the thrones in 2002.

The apparently lighthearted image has taken on new significance following Maxwell's arrest over the summer, with some suggesting it alludes to the close friendship between Maxwell and Prince Andrew. 

The paper said that the pair were on a private tour of the palace organised by the Duke of York for former US president Bill Clinton.

The photograph emerged after Maxwell was arrested in New Hampshire over allegations she helped disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, her former boyfriend, 'identify, befriend and groom' girls, including one as young as 14.
