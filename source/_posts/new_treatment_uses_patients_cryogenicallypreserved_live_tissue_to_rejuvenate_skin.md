A new treatment is promising to tackle wrinkles and reverse the signs of aging by using a patient's own frozen live tissue to rejuvenate their skin. 

Uvence is the first quality controlled fat transfer facial injection pioneered by Dr Olivier Amar for the Cosmetic Treatment Company in London, who claims it is 'the future' of non-surgical cosmetic treatments. 

The procedure, which is 100 per cent natural and costs upwards of £7,500, uses live tissue from a patient that has been frozen and preserved in order to re-plump their skin. 

Doctors extract fat cells from an unwanted pocket of fat on the body through a form of micro or mini liposuction, before they are purified and re-injected into the skin.    

A new treatment offers to extract and re-inject the patient's own fat cells  into their skin in order to erase the signs of ageing (pictured: left: before, right: after)

The first step is to have the small amount of fat extracted with a local anesthetic from an area such as the  outer thighs. 

The appointment can last 30 minutes and, while slightly uncomfortable afterwards, Dr Amar said the recovery period is minimal.

Meanwhile your tissue will then be placed in a medical-grade Uvence box and sent to the lab to be processed and frozen in a Cryyo Chamber. 

When patients are ready for treatment, the frozen cells are injected into the face using a syringe.  

The treatment can be use proactively or when marked sign of ageing have appeared. It claims to erase wrinkles and bring the skin's elasticity back. 

Treatments will then last several months.

Meanwhile the company can preserve ten injectable vials taken from the patient for future use for up to five years, allowing doctors and patients multiple uses from a single extraction.

The procedure can be carried out either proactively, as a reaction to signs of ageing, or used to fixed botched filler treatment.  

The procedure has been adopted by other cosmetic consultants as a way to offer 100 per cent natural services to their clients.  

Dr Maryam Zamani, a leading oculoplastic surgeon, said: 'Uvence is an innovative way to harvest small amounts of fat in a short procedure to then prepare into super enriched tissue to help improve quality of the skin. 

'It can be used in combination with injectables, energy based treatments and surgery to bolster collagen production and a more youthful preservation.' 

Dr. Amar, who is one of Europe's leading aesthetic consultant with 15 years of experience in cosmetic, plastic and reconstructive surgery, claimed that this new treatment is the future of cosmetic procedures.

Dr Amar said: 'This really is the future of cosmetic skin treatments, it is hugely exciting to see the next step in standardisation and quality for this kind of treatment.' 

'The Uvence offering allows access to regenerative and personalised treatments and is the biggest advance in the field for nearly 15 years. 

This new treatment is in line with the rising trend of 'tweakments,' or non-invasive, subtle non-surgical procedures bringing minimal changes to the skin. 

He said:  'In terms of accessibility and convenience this has never been seen before, the cryopreservation capability allows plastic and cosmetic surgeons alike to provide this treatment on a consistent basis to their patients without the need for further liposuction or tissue extraction.'
