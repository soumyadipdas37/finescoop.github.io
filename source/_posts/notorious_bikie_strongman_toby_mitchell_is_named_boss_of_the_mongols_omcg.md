Bikie strongman Toby Mitchell has reportedly taken over as the boss of the Mongols Outlaw Motorcycle Gang.

Mitchell was formerly a senior member of the Bandidos - an arch rival of the Mongols - but defected in 2013, in headline making news.

After news of his rise to the top of the Mongols broke on Friday, the heavily tattooed personal trainer took to Instagram to claim he had been the boss of the organisation for 12 months.

Mitchell's defection to the Mongols has led to a number of Bandidos coming over to join him, including ex-Bandidos national president Jason Addison, according to The Herald Sun. 

Addison, who served as the national Bandidos president for two decades, has also brought his sons to the Mongols.

The reason for his departure his unclear.

Around ten former Bandidos have ditched their former patches to join the Mongols over recent months.

The club now has more than 100 members since Mitchell took over the reigns. 

It was initially thought Mitchell joined the Mongols in April 2019.

A social media picture showed the 44-year-old smiling while wearing a black T-shirt with the word Mongols written across it in large font.

He was also apparently been spotted several times at the Mongols clubhouse in Port Melbourne.

Mitchell is a veteran bikie and convicted criminal who has survived two attempts on his life and has spent time behind bars. 

In June 2016, he was sentenced to almost two years in jail after he was busted with drugs and a weapon in his car.

Mitchell pleaded guilty to possessing ice, cocaine and a baton after police searched his car and Docklands apartment in September 2015.

Police found snaplock bags containing 331.8 grams of methamphetamine and 168.2 grams of cocaine inside Mitchell's car.

They also found a baton in the driver's door of the former bikie's car.

In passing sentence, a Judge Hicks said: 'You have a reasonably lengthy criminal history.

'I accept by your pleas of guilty that you have some remorse for your actions.'

Mitchell had 21 surgeries to save his life, and a further nine to deal with complications, the court heard

The judge noted Mitchell required ongoing medical attention after he was shot five times in the back outside a Brunswick gym in 2011.

Mitchell had 21 surgeries to save his life, and a further nine to deal with complications, the court heard.

While he recovered, the shooting effectively ended Mitchell's career as a personal trainer and a 'fitness fanatic' who had previously been a kickboxing champion.

The ex-Bandido also survived being shot in the arm in March 2013 after more than 30 rounds were fired at a Melton bikie clubhouse.
