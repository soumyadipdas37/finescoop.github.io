Elyse and Josh relocated to Byron Bay last year in search of a more environmentally conscious lifestyle. 

The Block winners are renting a $1.5million bohemian-style home featuring rustic furnishings and high ceilings. 

The sustainable property has three double bedrooms, wide verandas and a self-contained studio apartment attached and is conveniently located just a 10-minute walk from the beach.  

Elyse told Daily Mail Australia: 'The community is more environmentally conscious. [You see it in the] conversations that people have every single day… talking about the ocean and the marine life.'
