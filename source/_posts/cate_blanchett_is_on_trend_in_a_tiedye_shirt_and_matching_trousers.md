She has been wowing on the red carpet at this year's Venice Film Festival in a succession of stylish ensembles.

And Cate Blanchett proved that she can nail off-duty chic too, as she arrived at the  Excelsior Hotel in the Italian city on Sunday.

The 51-year-old Australian actor wore an on trend tie-dye shirt teamed with matching trousers.

She teamed the two-piece outfit with some quirky accessories, including a pair of leather platform sneakers and an Antik Batik beaded bag.

The Blue Jasmine star showed off her flawless complexion by going makeup free and wore her short blonde crop in a straight simple style.

Cate graciously signed autographs for fans as she arrived at her 5 star accommodation.

The beauty is heading the jury at the Venice Film Festival during a historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.

'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she told the AFP in regards to her thoughts on the matter.

'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.' 

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

According to Variety, when the Film Festival unveiled its official selection in late July, the 'unprecedented inclusion of eight female-directed titles within the 18-film roster was heralded as welcome progress for an event that has come under fire in recent years for scarce representation of female filmmakers.'

Cate was chosen to head the jury back in January, making her the third woman in four years to hold the role.
