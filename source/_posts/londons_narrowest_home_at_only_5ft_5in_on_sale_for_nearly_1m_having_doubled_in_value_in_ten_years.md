The narrowest house in London, standing only 5ft 5in wide, is going on sale today for £995,000.

The slender home in Shepherd's Bush has soared in value since it was last sold in 2009 for £595,000 to a lawyer who is now moving abroad.

The former hat shop, which was the home of fashion photographer Juergen Teller in the 1990s, is arranged over five floors.

The narrowest house in London, standing only 5ft 5in wide, is going on sale today for £995,000

Before its last sale, it was bought for £488,500 in 2006 by Simon Woods, the Pride and Prejudice actor married to Christopher Bailey, Burberry's former chief executive.

The facade, situated between a nail salon and a pizza restaurant, is painted blue and the unusual property offers 1,034 sq ft and two bedrooms.

It is arranged across a lower ground, ground, first, second and third floor, and has beautiful period features including a parquet floor, an original art deco bathtub and patterned wallpaper.

The interior is well designed to maximise the limited space, with a 24ft long kitchen on the lower ground floor which includes a forest green Aga providing central heating.

On the same floor is a long dining area with double glazed doors leading out to a patio and garden.

The first floor is reached by a spiral staircase where its future owner will find a roof terrace giving views of west London.

On the floor above is a bathroom, a dressing room and a shower room.

The main bedroom on the third floor is 20ft by 6ft, with a built-in double bed filling the width of the house. 

Simon Waller, who is handling the sale of the property at Winkworth, told The Telegraph it is the smallest house in London.

He said: 'We did see a contemporary one which was five foot wide but my managing director isn't sure if it is deemed fit for human habitation.'

The agent added that he once attended a New Year's Eve party hosted by a casting director at the house in 1994 that went on for four days.

He said: 'It was terribly bohemian - you could get lost in the different worlds over the five floors.'

Mr Waller added: 'Each owner has sprinkled their own fairy dust on it. The current owner likens it to a classic car - she's tinkering with it constantly.'
