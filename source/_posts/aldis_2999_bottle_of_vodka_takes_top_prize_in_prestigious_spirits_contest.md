Aldi Australia's $29.99 Tamova Vodka has won the Master medal at The Vodka Masters 2020 spirits contest in the UK.

The quadruple distilled alcohol has a 'sweet, clean and lifted' taste and is ideal for making refreshing beverages at home, such as martinis or cosmopolitans.

The vodka is part of Aldi's core range of spirits and is available all year round at stores across the country.

The annual competition is part of The Global Spirits Masters, which is the world's most highly regarded series of blind-tasting competitions.

The vodka along with other products were critiqued by 'independent expert judges' to ensure each contender was assessed constructively without any bias.

The Global Spirits Masters is the only blind-tasting competition to exclusively use independent judges, with no brand affiliation 

The judges can award Silver, Gold or Master medals as well as other trophies for outstanding excellence.

This isn't the first time the prized vodka has been crowned the best, as it also won the Gold medal at the 2019 Spirits International Prestige Awards, the Silver medal at the 2019 International Spirits Challenge and another Silver medal at the 2019 The Vodka Masters.

The award-winning vodka is best paired with citrus flavours, fresh herbs and fruits, including limes, apples, berries and mint. 

Other Aldi spirits have also been awarded gold medals at international competitions, including the Seville Orange Gin priced at $39.99.

Customers can purchase the Tamova Vodka at Aldi store locations across the country.
