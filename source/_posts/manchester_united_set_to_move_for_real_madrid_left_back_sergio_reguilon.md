Manchester United have become favourites to land Real Madrid's Sergio Reguilon after putting an offer on the table for the highly sought after 23-year-old.

Reguilon is likely to leave the Santiago Bernabeu this summer as Ferland Mendy and Marcelo have established themselves as Zinedine Zidane's first choice defenders.

Having played a crucial role on loan at Sevilla for the past campaign - helping them achieve a fourth-place finish in the league and qualify for the Champions League - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hopes Regilon will strengthen United's left-back position.

Last season United's left-back position was occupied by Luke Shaw - who was withdrawn from their Europa League campaign due to an ankle injury - and 20-year-old academy product, Brandon Williams.

Despite having his heart set on returning to Real Madrid, Zidane has added Reguilon to his list of player he is hoping to sell, to raise £180million in funds this summer to help deal with the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 

The Spain Under-21 international is likely to cost United around £25m with Real Madrid adding an option to buy-back clause in the contract.

Having been forced out the door, Reguilon has been tempted by the Red Devils offer as he has been assured of a starting place at Old Trafford - according to AS. 

Reguilon will also have the opportunity to prove himself on the European stage as United have confirmed their place in the Champions League.

Although Sevilla have been hopeful of keeping Reguilon for another season, United hold the upper hand in negotiations as they are able to offer him a long-term deal.

Having already bought Oscar Rodriguez from Madrid this summer, Sevilla would be looking for another loan agreement without an option to buy.
