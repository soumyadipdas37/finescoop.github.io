Zac Efron has been keeping a low profile in Byron Bay since news of his romance with waitress Vanessa Valladares surfaced.

As locals and tourists alike remain on the lookout for the Hollywood star, a lookalike of the actor has been fooling the town. 

Daily Mail Australia can reveal an unknown male in the region has been turning heads and making people do 'double takes' on the street.

The High School Musical star reportedly met new girlfriend Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress at the Byron Bay General Store café.

The cafe has since become a hotspot in Byron for those hoping to catch a rare glimpse of the actor with his ladylove.

Last week, multiple cafe patrons were convinced Zac had returned to the popular haunt for a quick takeaway coffee.

Pacing the pathway outside of the venue, and wearing a hat tilted down to partially conceal his face, numerous breakfast-goers whispered and pointed.

One cafe patron told Daily Mail Australia: 'We were sure it was him. He kept his distance from everyone and waited outside for his coffee order.'

'It wasn't just us, either. Others were looking. But, sadly it wasn't him. When he looked up to drink his coffee and walk away, it was just a lookalike. We were pretty embarrassed. We wished it was the real Zac.'

A waitress confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Vanessa no longer works at the Byron Bay General Store café.
