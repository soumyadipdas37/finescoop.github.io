Isabella Carlstrom will soon welcome her first child with wife Moana Hope.

And on Wednesday, the 28-year-old model flaunted her blossoming baby bump while standing in front of a mirror at her home in Melbourne.

Taking to Instagram, Isabella gently cradled her stomach as she turned her body to showed off her pregnant figure.

Earlier this month, ex-AFLW star Moana penned a sweet tribute to her pregnant wife.

Moana shared a photo of the couple kissing as a colourful floral projection beamed on them. The image was taken while they were on holiday in Japan.  

'Completely and utterly in love with you,' she wrote in the caption.

'I can't wait to share motherhood!' Moana penned a sweet tribute to her wife Isabella Carlstrom earlier this month, as they prepare for the arrival of their child

'@isabellasofiacarlstrom I can't wait to share motherhood with you,' she added, along with the hashtags #MyWife, #OurLife and AlwaysSmiling. 

Moana's heartfelt message to her wife comes after they celebrated their first wedding anniversary last month.

The former Australian Survivor star shared their wedding video to Instagram, and gushed over her expectant wife in the caption.

'Today last year I married my best friend, my soulmate and the mamma of our children to be,' Moana wrote.  

'I love that all we do is laugh, your smile makes my day light up. I wake happy knowing that I get to see and kiss your beautiful face. I'm completely in love with you. Thank you for always being you. Happy anniversary, my beautiful wife.'    

In May, Isabella announced she was expecting a child with Moana.

Bumping along nicely! Isabella has excitedly documented her pregnancy journey 

'It's time to be mummas! We feel so incredibly grateful to be able to share this news. I am pregnant and Mo and I are expecting our little one in November,' she told her Instagram followers.

'It's been a beautiful journey and I can't believe we're finally at this point. It wouldn't have been possible without the amazing team at Monash IVF, so a huge thank you to them. I'm so excited to raise our child with you, beautiful.'
