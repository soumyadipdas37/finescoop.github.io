Last month, she revealed that she quietly underwent gastric sleeve surgery two years ago, leaving to her jaw-dropping 85lb weight loss.

And Kelly Osbourne proudly showcased her newly slender frame on Friday, when she was spotted enjoying a lunch date with a pal at West Hollywood's Gracias Madre.

The TV personality, 35, looked casually cool in a grey top, which she teamed with figure-hugging black cropped trousers.

Keeping her face covered with a protective face mask amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the London-born star complemented her ensemble with black-and-white brogues.

Accessorising cat eye glasses and a selection of delicate jewellery, the daughter of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne styled her colourful tresses in a relaxed bun.

Wearing her patterned handbag across her torso, Kelly was seen laughing and chatting with her friend as they made their exit from the popular eatery.

Her outing came one month after she defiantly revealed that she underwent secret gastric sleeve surgery two years ago. 

'I had surgery,' Kelly stated in an interview. 'I don't give a f**** what anyone has to say. I did it, I'm proud of it, they can suck s****. I did the gastric sleeve.'

She added: 'All it does is change the shape of your stomach. I got that almost 2 years ago. I will never ever ever lie about it ever. It is the best thing I have ever done.'

Speaking on Hollywood Raw with Dax Holt and Adam Glyn, Kelly also discussed having injections to change the shape of her face, and make her jaw look 'skinnier', after suffering with TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction). 

'One thing I did that changed my face,' she added. 'I had really bad TMJ. One of the things they did to stop it was they gave me injections in my jaw. It kinda made my jaw look skinnier.'

'That's when people started to notice that I had really lost weight because it changed the shape of everything. I found out It’s called buckle fat. It changed everything on my face! How the f*** did I not know about this sooner?'

Earlier in August, Kelly had boasted about her weight loss on her social media, telling fans that she had 'worked hard' on getting her new shape.

'Yes...I'm bragging because I worked hard and it feels good!' she wrote alongside a photo of a 'small' size clothing tag.

In her 2017 memoir, Kelly wrote about her struggles with weight gain, as well her substance abuse issues, and described herself as having had 'a little dumpling body' which put her off going to the gym and exercising around thinner people.

Before she decided to get surgery, Kelly said that she had to fix her mind and get sober before she made any big decisions. 

She explained on the podcast: 'The number one thing I had to do was get happy. I had to fix my head before I could fix my body. You can never go into this if you’re not in a good mindset.'

'I stopped drinking, which is the best thing I've ever done. I really wanted to fix the things that were broken in me. I'm not perfect. I still make a lot of mistakes. I have bumps in the road, I fall down, I get back up again.'

Kelly also admitted that since showing off her weight loss, she has received more attention from men than ever, even being asked out seven times in one day.

'I woke up one day and I was all over the newspapers and sites. I had literally hundreds of text messages. I got asked out 7 times in one day. I said no thanks to every single one of them,' she said.

However, Kelly maintains that she hasn't had any plastic surgery work done on her face. 

'I've never f***** with my face. I'm too scared. My t*ts are saggy, and I want to get them fixed, but I'm scared of the surgery. All my friends I've helped recover from it. It looks so painful and they can't move their arms… I'm like nah, I'm good,' she said.

Kelly then describes a moment in 2017 when she had hit rock bottom with her drinking, and decided that she needed a lifestyle change, calling her brother Jack Osbourne to say she wanted to become a 'skinny winner.' 

'I was a functioning alcoholic,' she said. 'Full blown functioning alcoholic. I kept my job; I kept my friends. What it was for me, what I reached a spiritual low where I was just so morbidly unhappy and lost and directionless and just broken in every way.'

'I took a really hard hit when Joan [Rivers] died. It's still hard for me to even talk about it. She was my family; she was my mentor. When that ended and Fashion Police stopped, I was like, what am I? It was my identity, I felt destroyed.'

She continued: 'I hated myself in every way. I remember I picked up the phone August 8, 2017, and called my brother and I said "I’m done, I need some help, can you come to get me? I don't want to be a fat drunk loser anymore; I want to be a skinny winner." I was ready to work on myself and I did it.'

Kelly's mother Sharon is known for having had extensive plastic surgery, showing off the results of her fourth face lift last December. 

Sharon, 67, underwent gastric bypass surgery in 1999 after years of fluctuating with her weight, losing around 125lbs in weight. She decided to get the band removed in 2006.
