A popular high school teacher has died suddenly aged 29 after she gave birth to her third child.

Danielle Idai-Jawai and Aaron Tamwoy posed happily with their children Marley, six, and Isla, four, as they welcomed a new addition to their family - baby boy Xy - at central Queensland's Townsville University Hospital on September 14.

But the next evening the family was struck by tragedy after Ms Idai-Jawai is believed to have suffered a fatal cardiac arrest while recovering in the maternity ward. 

An online fundraiser set up to support Mr Tamwoy and their children through the grieving process said the mother 'had a heart of gold' and 'lived wholeheartedly for her beautiful little family'. 

Danielle Idai-Jawai and her partner Aaron Tamwoy pictured with her children Marley, six, and Isla, four, and their new arrival - a baby boy named Xy. Ms Idai-Jawai tragically passed away a day after giving birth to her third child

The parents were from Bamaga in remote far-northern Queensland and Ms Idai-Jawai  - known as 'Danga' to those close to her - worked at the Northern Peninsula Area State College in the furthest reaches of the Cape York Peninsula.

In the weeks before Ms Idai-Jawai's sudden death, Mr Tamwoy paid tribute to his partner in a touching Facebook post.

'Happy birthday to my beautiful partner in this crazy journey we call life,' he wrote alongside a photo of the family sat down for a meal. 

'Thank you for all that you are to myself and the kids. We love you.' 

Friend Lauren Watson - who worked with the late mother - said Ms Idai-Jawai took her in like she was family after she moved to the remote area.

'Danga gave me a beautiful turtle painting and said "You’re not my teaching partner anymore you’re my sister,"' she told The Courier-Mail.

'That conversation just keeps playing in my head.' 

The friend said both Ms Idai-Jawai and her partner were passionate fans of basketball and the only thing she loved doing more was her role as a mother. 

Mr Tamwoy works closely with residents in the remote area through the Northern Peninsula Area Family and Community Services and is also a basketball coach. 

The GoFundMe fundraiser set up for the family has already raised almost $40,000 towards its $50,000 goal since being first set up on September 20.

'The funds will go towards funeral logistics and to ease the financial burden this small family will now face so unexpectedly,' the page said.

'As a family we would appreciate any contribution as Aaron will have to sort his work arrangements out and will now be the sole parent of their kids Marley, Isla and their new baby Xy.'
