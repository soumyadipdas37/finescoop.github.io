Real Housewives of Sydney star Lisa Oldfield has appeared to acrimoniously split from her boyfriend, James Laws, after nearly a year and a half of dating.

In a now-deleted Instagram clip shared on Saturday, the reality star dramatically flushed a ring down the toilet which was previously gifted to her by him.

'Should have had him #spayed along with the dog,' the 45-year-old fumed in her caption.

The video showed Lisa dropping a dazzling black diamond and silver ring into the toilet before flushing.

Lisa debuted her romance with James, who she lovingly called 'Jimbo', in March 2019, following the end of her 18-year marriage to politician, David Oldfield.

At the time, James gushed to The Daily Telegraph about his 'whip-smart, gorgeous, funny and easy-going' new girlfriend, Lisa.

In August 2019, a smitten Lisa confessed that she wanted to marry James

She told the Kyle and Jackie O Show that she thinks they will marry in 2020. 'I reckon we'll be married by the end of next year,' Lisa said.

She added: 'He's the real deal. He's a super nice guy, supportive, so amazing with my boys.'

In January, the pair fuelled engagement rumours after Lisa flaunted a stunning ring on her wedding finger on social media.

However, she confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the ring was a birthday present from John, not an engagement ring.

The tech entrepreneur was previously married to David Oldfield, who co-founded Australia's One Nation party with Pauline Hanson.

The political party has been criticised for its nationalist policies and anti-immigration stance.

Lisa officially split from David early last year, after 18 years together.

She rose to mainstream fame in 2017, when she joined the cast of reality show The Real Housewives of Sydney.

The mother-of-two was known for her vicious arguments with her co-stars, including Krissy Marsh and Victoria Rees, as well as her unorthodox parenting methods.
