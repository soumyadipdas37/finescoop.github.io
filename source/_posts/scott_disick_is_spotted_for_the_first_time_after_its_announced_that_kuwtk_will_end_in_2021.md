The Kardashian–Jenner clan announced earlier in the day that their long-running reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians would bow out for good in 2021 at the conclusion of its 20th season.

But series fixture Scott Disick didn't seem bothered by the end of the series as he was spotted out in Calabasas, California, on Tuesday.

The 37-year-old reality star looked fierce in a button-up shirt covered in roaring tigers while taking care of errands around the LA-adjacent city.

Scott paired his busy shirt with a pair of green camouflage cargo pants.

He matched his pale yellow Nike sneakers to his shirt and added a silver wristwatch for some extra luxury. 

The former model wore his brown hair slicked back and blocked out the sun with tortoiseshell sunglasses. 

Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, neither he nor his friend wore masks.

Earlier in the day, the Kardashians shared a statement announcing that KUWTK was coming to an end.

The series would call it quits after its 20th season in 2021, though fans will still have it and the upcoming 19th season to look forward to.

'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up With The Kardashians,' they wrote.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years — through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children,' they continued.

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.'

End of an era: Scott has been a fixture on the show for years, even after he and Kourtney Kardashian ended their relationship

Scott seems to have been in on the decision to set an end date for the series, as his name was listed alongside the Kardashian–Jenner women, despite the fact that his ex Kourtney had stepped away from the show for the upcoming season.

Scott may have signaled the end of the show earlier in the day when he posted a photo of himself on a golf course overlooking a gorgeous vista as the sun set.

'Sunsets and things,' he captioned the snap.

But the photo also tied in with photos Kourtney shared earlier on Tuesday that were also sunset themed.

She shared a picture of herself on what appeared to be the same golf course at sunset, along with other lovely sunset snaps.

'sun moon stars obsession,' she captioned the pictures.

Synergy: But the photo also appeared to be from another of his outings with Kourtney, who shared a photo of herself seemingly at the same place in a post that was also about the sun

Heading home: On Monday, Scott posted a selfie of himself in a gray hoodie while standing near a private jet. 'Going going back back 2 Cali,' he wrote ahead of his trip

The day before, Scott posted a selfie of himself in a black baseball cap and a gray hoodie while standing near a private jet.

'Going going back back 2 Cali,' he wrote ahead of his trip.

The reality star has been spending time with Kourtney and their three children in recent weeks, following his split from Sofia Richie, 22.

He and the model originally broke up following his brief rehab stint in May, though they appeared to have reunited in July when they spent Independence Day together.

But the relationship wasn't long-lived, and now Scott has had more time to devote to Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five.
