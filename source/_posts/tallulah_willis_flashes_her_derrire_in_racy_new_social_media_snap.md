The statuesque beauty left very little to the imagination in the picture which showed her taking a photograph on her phone.

The daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore worked her best angle as she stood in front of an ornate fire place for the sexy snap.

Clearly feeling in a cheeky mood, the star simply captioned the post 'Honey, she’s home'. 

Open book: The daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, has been very candid about her struggles with mental health and body image recently 

Tallulah has been very open about her struggles with mental health and even an eating disorder.

Though she has seemed to be in good spirits these past few months Tallulah is always one to candidly discuss how her mood ebbs and flows. 

Switching gears from her ethereal beach snaps, Tallulah bravely opened up to her 332K Instagram followers earlier this month.

In honor of September being National Suicide Prevention Month, the brunette beauty Instagrammed a baby photo of herself shot by legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz with a poignant caption.  

 'I have low days, and in my lowest of lows, limbs heavy from exhaustion, I have questioned if I have the energy to keep pushing another day. Truly a horrifying sentiment to have swimming in your head' she wrote. 

'But then I try to remember, I do it for her. I do it because she needs a voice, a champion, a Big Kid; To tell her it's ok, that she is safe that she is protected.'

She continued, 'If you look in the mirror and feel like what stares back is not worthy of love and care, if you can’t trust your own intrinsic value as a human being, do it for them. Do it for them until one day, one alarmingly beautiful day, you can do it for yourself.' 

The brunette continues to be a pinnacle of strength and light for her followers, providing a sort of unfiltered edge on her page that often gets lost on social media.

Tallulah is currently dating Dillon Buss, with the couple isolating together during lockdown.
