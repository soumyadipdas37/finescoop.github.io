According to NSC Total, the baby girl remains in the Children's Hospital of Florianopolis, where she has been given antibiotics and pain medication for the injuries sustained when she was ripped from her mother's belly, but is otherwise in good general health.

The autopsy will confirm if the baby was removed with the pregnant woman alive or if she was already dead.

Flavia, who studied pedagogy and worked as a substitute teacher, was buried in the Municipal Cemetery of Canelinha after a brief ceremony.
