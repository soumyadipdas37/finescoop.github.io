Dele Alli's Tottenham future has been plunged into more doubt after it was revealed he has not been included in the squad to face Chelsea tonight.

The England midfielder has been linked with a move away from north London in the transfer window, and he appears to have dropped down Mourinho's pecking order this season.

Alli has only started one match, coming off at half-time against Everton, and has come on as a substitute just once, in the Europa League against Shkendija.

The Telegraph are now reporting that despite Mourinho insisting he will rotate his squad for the Carabao Cup, Alli has still not made it into his manager's plans. 

When asked about his plans for the competition at the weekend, Mourinho claimed it was impossible to fight for the League Cup trophy amid his side's heavy fixture schedule.

'What would you do in my position?' he said. 'I would like to fight for the Carabao but I don't think I can. We have a game on Thursday that gives us not as much money as the Champions League, but the group phase of the Europa League gives us a certain amount that for a club like us is very important.

'It's a competition with a possible group phase that gives us a good chance to go through to the next knockout stage, so this game on Thursday is very important for us.'

But despite the games coming thick and fast for Mourinho and his team, Alli has still not made it into the squad and a move away in the January window now appears even more likely.

One team credited with an interest in the 24-year-old is Paris Saint-Germain, but the French giants have been put off by the asking price placed upon his head.

Alli will be desperate to secure first-team football this season, with the rescheduled European Championships coming next summer.

It is unlikely that Alli will leave Spurs permanently, but a season-long loan could be sanctioned if it is right for all parties.
