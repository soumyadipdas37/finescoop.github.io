Bella Varelis got into a heated argument with her best friend Irena Srbinovska during Thursday night's episode of The Bachelor.

And on Monday, the 25-year-old, told TV Week, she doesn't regret confronting Irena, 31, because she had 'tipped her over the edge'.

'Although I lost a friend, I'm grateful it all got brought to the surface,' she said.

'It ended up being the beginning of some beautiful friendships with the other ladies that I'll have for the rest of my life,' she added.

Bella also accused Irena of falsifying stories and claimed two friends dating the same guy was 'a disaster waiting to happen'.

'I'm usually not one to allow petty behaviour get to me but when someone falsifies stories, it tips me over the edge especially when I felt she was using it as a way to get in between Locky and me,' she said.

Bella and Irena got into a heated argument during Thursday night's episode of The Bachelor.

Their confrontation took place within days of the cast returning to the mansion after several months of COVID-19 lockdown.

The women, who had been close friends earlier in the season, clashed because Irena had supposedly misled Bella about how often she was communicating with Locky Gilbert outside of the 'official' Zoom sessions.

After telling Irena she didn't trust her, marketing consultant Bella stood up and stormed off in the middle of the cocktail party.

'Friendship done. I'm f**king over your bulls**t, to be honest! You're a manipulative little b***h!' she yelled.

Nurse Irena confessed she was 'in complete and utter shock' at Bella's reaction, and agreed that their friendship was effectively over.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
