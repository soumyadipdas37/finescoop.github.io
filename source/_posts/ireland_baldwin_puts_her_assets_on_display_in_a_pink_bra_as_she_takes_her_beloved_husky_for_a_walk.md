Ireland Baldwin has been enduring a tranquil quarantine with boyfriend Corey Harper and her army of rescue dogs amid COVID-19. 

But the 24-year-old model was spotted beyond the confines of her home on Thursday afternoon as she took her beloved Husky for a walk in Los Angeles.

Baldwin put her ample chest on display in a bright pink bralette that matched the rubber band in her hair.

She paired the jaw dropping top with some high-waisted denim jeans.

Instead of rocking some trainers or a pair of flip flops, Ireland opted to trek around her neighborhood barefoot. 

Her golden hair was neatly slicked back and tied up into a chic top knot.

Ireland, who happens to be the daughter of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, had a rather eventful day on Thursday.

In the morning, Ireland and her beau Corey Harper grabbed a delicious breakfast at Sweet Butter in Sherman Oaks.

She showed off the incredible dish on her Instagram Story, which appeared to be a stack of pancakes doused in Nutella and served with a side of eggs and bacon.

After their breakfast date, Ireland and Corey headed to the beach with a pal and one of their adorable dogs.

She followed up her post with a picture of her darling dog, who happened to be wearing a bright pink harness, with sand all over his nose.

Ireland and Corey have been spending a lot of their time outdoors amid the pandemic. 

Last month, the couple ventured to Oregon and they brought Ireland's beloved Husky along for the ride.

Baldwin documented some of her favorite moments of the trip on Instagram, including a riverside date.
