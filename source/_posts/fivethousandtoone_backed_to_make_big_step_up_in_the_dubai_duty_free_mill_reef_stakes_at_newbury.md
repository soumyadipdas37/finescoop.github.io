Fivethousandtoone is 9-4 favourite with Coral to give trainer Andrew Balding his first win in the feature Dubai Duty Free Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury on Saturday.

Balding has yet to win the race named after the brilliant 1971 Derby and Arc winner trained by his father Ian.

Fivethousandtoone, who was an effortless winner at Newcastle on his last run, faces seven rivals including Bahrain Pride, who beat him on his Windsor debut.

Balding said: ‘He’s a horse we’ve always liked a lot at home, so it was great to see him be so impressive on the racecourse at Newcastle. It is a big step up for him but the ground will suit and he is bred to be a decent horse.

‘We have been placed a few times in the Mill Reef and for obvious reasons it would mean a lot to win the race for the whole family. We will be giving it our best shot.’

Fivethousandtoone, a son of Frankel who cost 475,000gn as a yearling, carries the colours of King Power and is named after the odds bookmakers quoted for Leicester City ahead of their sensational 2015-16 Premier League winning season.
