The devil is in the detail — every granny's favourite saying. And when it comes to fashion, it's true.

Attending shoots, I'm struck by the big picture of the clothes: the colours, the mood, the prints. A true fashion stylist, however, will wave the hem of a £2,000 Chanel jacket at you and drone on at length about how a chain stitched into it gives it the right weight and 'hang' — and how, sadly, that's why you'll never get the same level of quality for £50 on the High Street.

The current trend for buttons is this idea writ large; they can make or break an outfit, making it look cheap (if they're plastic or faux tortoiseshell) or expensive (if they're textured ceramic or chunky, vintage brass) — and can flatter your figure.

Do you have an outfit in need of an instant sophistication upgrade? Just change the buttons! Recently, I bought a plain but flattering black, 1960s-style tunic top with a cream tie neck. I added some oversized vintage pastel buttons to the front and, hey presto, much more interesting.

Essentially they work as a highlighter, drawing the eye. So think about the parts of your outfit or body you want to spotlight, and look for button placement accordingly.

I love Topshop's clever cream trousers (above centre), with their asymmetric waistband starring giant buttons — flattering to your middle (and a total steal at £15). Zara's powder-blue top with buttons up the collarbone (far left) will narrow your shoulders, while L.K.Bennett's chic chambray skirt will make you look longer and leaner.

If you have no figure-related agenda (lucky you), then enjoy the delights of the button as a fabulous feature. Covered designs add interest to Zara's cotton dress (third from right), while Mango's puff-sleeved frock (third from left) looks designer-level thanks to its contrasting buttons.

As for me, I'll be snapping up this juicy mango delight of a dress by ASOS (above right).
