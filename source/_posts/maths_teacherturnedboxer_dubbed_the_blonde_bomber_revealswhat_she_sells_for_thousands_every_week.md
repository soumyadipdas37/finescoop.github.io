A glamorous maths teacher turned boxer is making a fortune from a 'creepy' side project earning her thousands of dollars every week.

Boxing sensation Ebanie Bridges juggles her life as a mathematics teacher at Sydney's Westfields Sports High School while also remaining undefeated in the ring with the nickname 'Blond Bomber'.

In July the 33-year-old revealed that a UK boxing fan ask to buy one of her used training socks, and she pocketed $900.

The 33-year-old (pictured) is now making a small fortune selling her used socks on the internet

'I'm a professsional boxer and a UK boxing fan has just paid me 500£ to send my dirty training socks to him in the UK,' she wrote on Twitter.

'Who needs #OnlyFans when you have dirty socks.' 

While it was initially just a laugh with friends, Bridges' tweet went viral and her side project exploded - and she's now earning more than $1,000 a week.

She has made more than $4,000 in the past four weeks, with dedicated fans paying more than $100 just for pictures of her socks on the floor.

But Bridges is charging even more to fans who want a used sock for themselves, selling two socks from the same pair to two different people for $2,000.

'You know how much money I've made from that s***,' she told news.com.au.

'The story went like global in 25 countries or something like that so I had all these sock people from around the world. I've made a bit of money, I'm not going to lie.'

Bridges admitted she finds it strange when she's asked by some fans to sell pictures of her feet without socks on, saying it feels as if she's selling nude photos.

Since beginning her surprising side business, the undefeated boxing champion has been contacted every day by fans on Twitter about her socks.

'To me it's just business. I don't play around,' she said.

Bridges has dedicated much of her life to teaching high school children and even runs empowerment clinics for at-risk teenagers and girls with anxiety.

Through the high school, she also runs 20 week boxing and life coaching seminars each week to instill confidence in her students.

Her inspiration comes from her own teenage years as Bridges said she had it 'pretty bad' in high school, but now wants to give back to people going through the same experience.

Bridges has pushed to break gender stereotypes as a maths teacher and boxer, previously telling Daily Mail Australia she was tired of getting a 'weird reaction' from people when she says what she does for work.

'I get a reaction no matter what I do, from boxing to being a maths teacher, because of the way I look,' Bridges (pictured) said

'They never believe me because of the way I look,' she said. 

Yet Bridges said her students have been really supportive and when they're behaved she even lets them hold her winning belts from her matches.

'I take it to school and they kids really love it.

'They ask me all the time, when's your next fight miss? When's your next fight?' 

The 33-year-old is a bigger name in the UK than in Australia and is looking to move to England as it has a more lucrative female boxing market.

If it weren't for the global coronavirus pandemic, she would have already been there.
