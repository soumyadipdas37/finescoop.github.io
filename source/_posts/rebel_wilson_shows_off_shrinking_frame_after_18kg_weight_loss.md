Rebel Wilson has been on an incredible health and fitness journey this year, losing at least 18kg.

And on Friday, the Australian actress drew attention to her shrinking frame in a chic ensemble, in photos shared to Instagram.

The 40-year-old revealed a glimpse of cleavage and her tinier waist in a white top and black pants, as she posed on a couch with an adorable pooch in Los Angeles.

Rebel added a chic red cardigan and white loafers to the look, and swept her blonde locks into a sleek high ponytail.

She appeared to have worn minimal makeup, allowing her natural beauty to shine through.

'I made a new friend today x thanks Aunty Hilary,' Rebel captioned a sweet photo shared to her official page, of the dog resting its paw on her leg.

The Pitch Perfect star also shared a near-identical photo with the pooch to her Instagram Stories.

Rebel also follows the Mayr Method diet plan, which encourages followers to chew their food slowly and to reduce their sugar intake

According to People magazine, Rebel's remarkable transformation is partially down to following the Mayr Method diet plan.

'It's an approach that eliminates food intolerances, reduces sugar, encourages eating whole foods slowly, boosts the immune system and reduces inflammation,' a source said.

'She exercises with a personal trainer up to six times a week, goes on walks and is trying to up her protein intake nutritionally.'

Meanwhile her personal trainer Jono recently shared her workout routine with E! Australia.
