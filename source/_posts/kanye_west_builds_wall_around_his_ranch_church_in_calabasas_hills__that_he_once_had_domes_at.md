Kanye West has erected a large white wall around the ranch style church he has on his 300-acre property in Calabasas Hills, California.

In new photos, a pair of structures belonging to the rapper, 43, are seen surrounded by the white wall.

The Grammy-winning performer had previously tried to erect a set of dome structures there last year prior to Los Angeles County Department of Public Works officials ordering him to tear them down.

Problems arose from the project amid complaints from neighboring residents who were rankled by the noise and traffic the construction of the domes attracted to the area.

'Cars everywhere, and it was obviously an imposition on everybody on the street with very little notice,' one neighbor of the rapper told KCAL. 

Authorities made the Bound 2 artist take down the domes - which West drew inspiration from, referencing the fictional Star Wars planet Tatooine - in September of 2019, citing a lack of permits required.

West weighed the possibility of building the structures to help curb the homeless problem in his initial design.

A second structure had a large wall bordering the property but not completed the whole way around 

Public works officials told CNN of the structures, 'It's the objective of our building officials to help property owners build in a way that protects public safety and is in compliance with state and county codes.

'This is a standard enforcement action for our office, and property owners are given ample time to comply with the order by either removing the unpermitted construction or submitting plans for approval and securing a building permit(s).'

The father-of-four, who shares North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, one, with wife Kim Kardashian, eventually built the domes on property he owns in Wyoming with the reality star.
