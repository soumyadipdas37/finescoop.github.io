He's the handsome design judge on The Block who never seems to age a day.

And it appears fans of Darren Palmer are questioning if the popular judge has undergone a renovation of his own to maintain his youthful visage.

According to Woman's Day, fans of the interior designer, 42, have commented on his fresh face on social media, including one who wrote: 'What has Darren done to his face!? He looks so strange.'

Another said of his complexion: 'He's impossibly shiny and smooth.'

While a third commented on his new hairstyle: 'Black dyed perms look ridiculous on any man.'

Meanwhile, other fans are gushing about his look, including one who recently commented: 'I know you're a happily married family man, Darren Palmer, but damn you are looking fine this season.'

'I used to sit in bed and pray that no one would be gay because that was easier for me than accepting that I was,' he said. 

'I just didn't want [being gay] to exist because then it wouldn't apply to me and then I wasn't one of 'those' people.' 

In the interview, which is part of the fashion bible's Men Who Raised Us podcast, the ruggedly handsome interior designer also spoke about the heartfelt moment his dad accepted him for who he is - in fact, even encouraged it.

It happened one day when Darren overheard his dad talking to one of his mates on the phone, assuring him that his gay son was still his son. 

'I know he said that so I could hear it... he was letting me know it was okay for me to tell him when I was ready,' added Darren.
