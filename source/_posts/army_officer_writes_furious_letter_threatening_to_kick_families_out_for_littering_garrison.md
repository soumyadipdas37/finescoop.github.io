An army commanding officer has been left so outraged by families failing to clean after themselves at their garrison that he's threatened to kick them out.

Fed-up Lt Col Paul Brazier has said the garrison streets are so filthy, they are the worst he's witnessed in his entire service spanning 37 years.

He's been left so appalled by the amount of rubbish left around Warminster Garrison, Wiltshire, he's sent out a stark warning to all the tenants saying he will no longer put up with it.

To make his message crystal clear the fuming officer has sent out letters to residents reminding them that under their rental agreement they are responsible for the upkeep of the area.

In it he's written: 'I walked around your estate and I was appalled by the amount of rubbish and litter strewn around.

'Regardless of you being military or civilian, I have the authority to revoke your licence to occupy your accommodation and if necessary I will.' 

This letter was sent out to all the residents living in the Warminster Garrison urging them to take action and clear up their rubbish

Residents living in Warminster Garrison (pictured) have been warned to clean up their act or face eviction 

The houses in the Warminster Garrison are occupied by service families from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, civilian contractors and MoD staff.

Lt Col Brazier is expecting tenants to take swift action and has ordered an 'estate-wide litter sweep called Operation Womble'.

Residents have until October 15 to get their act together.
