A video circulating on social media reveals the disgusting dirt lurking in plain sight on dark coloured upholstery.

The clip, originally shared in an Australian cleaning group on Facebook, shows a woman rubbing the backseat of her car with a Bissell 'Proheat Revolution' carpet cleaner.

While the seats are not visibly stained, the plastic container on the back of the machine quickly fills with murky brown water - proving the horrifying amount of grime embedded in the fabric. 

'B****y disgusting! This is just a general clean, there wasn't anything spilled or any really visible stains - just 10 years of filth,' the woman wrote in the caption.

People were quick to respond to the video, with some expressing horror while others admitted they found the footage 'satisfying' to watch.

'Disgusting, but awesome,' one woman replied.

'Oh dear… but so very satisfying,' said a second, while a third added: 'This is disgusting. I love it.'

Others said they had discovered similar levels of filth on what they believed to be 'clean' furniture and soft furnishings.

'I've just finished my house, rugs and car and was disgusted with the dirt it pulled out. I thought I was a clean person until then!' said one woman.

Another felt equally ashamed, writing: 'I did this to my car and was mortified.'

And it's not the only home cleaning horror that's been revealed on social media in recent weeks.

The woman said there were no spillages on the seats, 'just 10 years of filth' lurking in plain sight

In August, a self-professed 'clean freak' was disgusted after making a grim discovery under the drain of here kitchen sink.

After watching a tutorial on household cleanliness, the woman asked her husband to prise off the stainless steel ring sealed over the pipe - only to find the plastic beneath was encased in a grotesque layer of congealed dirt.

Sickened by the sight, she posted photos in an Australian cleaning group on Facebook to warn others about what lies beneath the seemingly spotless base of the sink.

'I'm a clean freak but I was nearly [vomiting] when I saw what was in there,' she wrote in the caption. 'Just disgusting but all clean now and siliconed (sic) back in place.'

The woman said she scoured the plastic with Gumption multipurpose cleaning paste, which is sold in leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths for $5.40. 

Hundreds replied to the post, expressing their revulsion and pledging to investigate their own drains without delay.

'I never knew we can unscrew [drain coverings], I didn't even know it builds up dirt like this,' one woman said.

'I've been living in my house for three years and I'm so scared to do mine now, I can't imagine what I will find in there.'

Another said she is 'now officially terrified' of her sink, joking: 'Will have to get hubby to do all the dishes now. What a shame for me.'
