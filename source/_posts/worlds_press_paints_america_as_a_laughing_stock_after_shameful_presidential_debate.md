Press across the globe have branded the United States a laughing stock following Tuesday night's tumultuous debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

In the heated debate, Trump bulldozed over Biden with repeated interruptions, insults were thrown back and forth and moderator Chris Wallace failed to maintain order amid the chaos.

Papers and news outlets across the globe deemed the debate a 'shame', a 'chaotic spectacle of political theater', and Trump's potential re-election 'the first line of America's obituary'.
