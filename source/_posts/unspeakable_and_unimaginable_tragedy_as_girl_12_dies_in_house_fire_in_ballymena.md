A local councilor described the incident as an 'unspeakable and unimaginable tragedy'.  

The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) confirmed one person was rushed from the burning house to hospital. 

Local Councillor Matthew Armstrong gave his 'deepest sympathies' to the victim's family. 

'My deepest sympathies to the family and everyone involved,' he told Belfast Live.  

'It is an unspeakable and unimaginable tragic event and one in an area that has sadly been no stranger to tragedies in last short period of time. 

'Sometimes in all honesty there are no words to express or even to imagine what the family are going through at the minute. I am truly devastated and heartbroken for them all.' 

The incident marks  the second death reported in the Ballykeel area of the town on Wednesday after a man's body was discovered at a flat in Crebilly Drive, sparking a murder investigation.
