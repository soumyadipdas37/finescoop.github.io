 WHAT'S NOW & HOW TO DO IT: FINE LINERS

British beauty expert Elsa McAlonan reveals how to get the feline flick look

There's no escaping the feline flick trend this autumn, but the good news is that the newest fine eyeliners make the look simpler than ever to perfect.



Easiest on the eyes is Milk's Kush Liquid Eyeliner (£20, selfridges.com) with cannabis seed oil, which helps the felt-tip glide along the delicate lash line.

Meanwhile, Kiko's double-ended and water-resistant Lost In Amalfi Eye Marker Duo has one fine tip and one thicker, angled tip for fool-proof application.

Barry M's On Point Eyeliner makes perfect lines easy to achieve with its ultra-fine tip.

And, for false lash fans, Eylure's Line & Lash delivers eyeliner along with a precise line of adhesive.

DENISE VAN OUTEN'S MULTI-TASKER

Denise Van Outen is a big fan of Dr Paw Paw multi-tasking products, recently showing on Instagram how easily the brand's It Does It All 7 in 1 Hair Treatment Styler (£12.99, drpawpaw.com) untangles her hair.

With ingredients including nourishing pawpaw fruit and aloe vera, the do-it-all hero lives up to its name, adding shine, protecting against heat damage, smoothing split ends, conditioning, taming frizz, aiding styling and gently detangling hair.

THIS WORKS 

We know retinol as a powerful anti-ageing ingredient in facial skincare, but now The Solution Retinol Smoothing Body Lotion delivers the same benefits for your body. 

It targets a variety of concerns, from age spots and pigmentation to wrinkles and visible sun damage. 

In Superdrug stores from September 16.

 



RACE YOU THERE! 

The latest W7 Velvet Luxe Lipstick collection offers a little luxury for less. 

Priced at £3.50 each, the long-lasting lipsticks are available in eight flattering autumnal colours, including Belmont Jewel, What's Nude? and Earthquake, a natural shade that's similar to Charlotte Tilbury's iconic Matte Revolution Very Victoria lipstick — but more than £20 cheaper.

IS TAP WATER AGEING MY SKIN? 

Yes, the nature of the water supply where you live could determine how well your skin ages.

'Hard water increases transepidermal water loss and forms a residue on the skin's surface,' says dermatologist Dr Vikram Rajkomar, of Pall Mall Medical. 

'This has the effect of drying the skin.'

A reader asks if tap water is ageing their skin. Elsa says that yes, the water supply in your area could determine how your skin ages. Pictured: the new Liz Earle Hydrating Cream Mask (£20, john lewis.com) is formulated to replenish and protect skin's moisture levels.

Check the water hardness in your area and get recommendations for your skin type with the new online tool available at cosmetify.com/the-water-effect.

If you're looking for a quick way to bring moisture back to your skin, the new Liz Earle Hydrating Cream Mask (£20, john lewis.com) is formulated with shea butter and apricot kernel oil to replenish and protect skin's moisture levels.

SHAMELESS INDULGENCE

 

Estee Lauder's limited edition Pink Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex is a treat for your complexion — and buying it will make you feel good on the inside, too, as 20 per cent of the purchase price goes to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

The silky serum helps to reduce the signs of ageing and the effects of the environment on our skin, increasing radiance, smoothness and minimising the appearance of fine lines. 

It's available until June 2021, so you have plenty of time to stock up on the pretty pink bottle, which even comes with a pink ribbon bracelet that you can wear to show your support.
