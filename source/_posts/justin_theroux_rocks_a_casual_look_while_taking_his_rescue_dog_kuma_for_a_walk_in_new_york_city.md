Theroux rescued Kuma in the summer of 2018 from Texas, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

The actor introduced his beloved new pet in an Instagram post in June 2018, with the first photo of his pet.

'Meet Kuma!!! There are too many people to thank for Kuma.... @jesselee81 and William and everyone @chancetobloom,' he began.

'You are the heroes who took Kuma from death and loved her back to life. Also @austinpetslive for steering me towards a new adoption,' he added.

The actor also thanked 'Katie and Ryan and all the pilots with @pilotsandpaws... showing that ALL breeds can fly. Especially the ones most in need.' 

He also encouraged his fans to adopt a pet of their own by going to Pet Finder and to donate to Chance to Bloom in Kuma's name.
