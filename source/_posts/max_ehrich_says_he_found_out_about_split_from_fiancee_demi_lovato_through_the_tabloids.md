Whilst another insider added: 'She doesn't trust him and thinks he's sketchy... She feels he proposed to get attention.'

A third source explained: 'Things started going downhill [when he said he was flying out to Atlanta for work]. They were arguing a lot and Demi didn't want him to go without her... There has been a lot of tension and Demi left him to get a clear head.'

However, Demi is said to be 'distraught' over the split.

A source told E! News: 'She really loved him and wanted it to work. Demi is really upset and distraught about it.'

A source told People on Thursday: 'It was a tough decision, but Demi and Max have decided to go their separate ways to focus on their respective careers.'

Demi and Max have had a whirlwind romance, that started in March just before the coronavirus pandemic began. 

And sources later revealed that they had decided to quarantine together at Demi's house amid the lockdown.  

Demi and the former soap opera actor quickly began boasting about their love on social media.  

They announced their engagement in July, alongside a beachside photoshoot showing off Demi's shining diamond ring.  

Earlier this month, Demi admitted they were considering eloping amid the pandemic limiting large gatherings to 10 people.

The singer shared that she wants their wedding to be 'sacred' between them, as she dished to Popcrush Nights.

Seeming torn between a big wedding and eloping she said 'On one hand, I would love to elope because my life is so public and I want to keep it sacred between me and him. 

Adding: 'On the other hand, I want my friends and family to be there for a celebration. But I can't do that until the pandemic's over because it's not safe.'

Their relationship seemed to hit rocky water earlier this month when fans claimed to have screenshots of tweets and other social media posts by Max pitting Demi and her former BFF Selena Gomez, against each other. 

Demi took to Instagram earlier this month to seemingly debunk a slew of viral screenshots that showed rude tweets made by Max, in 2015.  

'It's really sad when people FAKE images to put women against each other. If women have conflict that's between them NOT YOU,' the former Disney star wrote. 

In the tweets, Max allegedly wrote that Lovato's former best friend Selena  was 'prettier' and more vocally gifted that her.

And this week, following the split, more posts have emerged where Max appeared to write to Selena 'Marry me now' during live broadcasts.

He is also said to have got a matching tattoo, just like the one of a musical note on Selena's wrist.

There is a blog dedicated to uncovering max's alleged past posts about his love for Selena. He is also accused of setting up fake profile about him and Selena being the 'perfect couple'.

Before their split, when rumors of Max's obsession first emerged, Demi passionately challenge the validity of the past tweets and she went as far as to urge 'tabloids' to write about 'more important sh*t.'

Selena is, clearly, a touchy subject for Demi, being that the pair have endured a rocky friendship since rising to fame on Disney Channel in the mid-2000s.

Lovato opened up about their crumbling friendship in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in May.

'When you grow up with somebody, you're always going to have love for them. But I'm not friends with her, so it felt….I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best,' she explained.
