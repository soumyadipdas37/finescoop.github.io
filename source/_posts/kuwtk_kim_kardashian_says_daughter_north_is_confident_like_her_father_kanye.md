Kim Kardashian was by her daughter North's side in Paris in March when she sang at her father Kanye West's Yeezy fashion in Paris.

And on Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the 39-year-old matriarch shared that her eldest daughter is just like her rapper dad.

'I'm so proud of how confident she is,' she said of North. 'She obviously gets that from her dad, and it just makes me so happy that she's not afraid to try anything. You know, she's just so fearless, and I love that about her. And I'm such a proud mom.'

On stage: And on Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the 39-year-old matriarch shared that her eldest daughter is just like her rapper dad 

Kim was anxious when North was rapping in front of a crowd for the first time.

'She's never even been up on a stage and practiced,' Kim said. 'So to see her up there, my nerves are just, I honestly start crying because I'm happy for her, but I'm so nervous for her.'

'So you know my name is Northie,' the girl chanted to cheers at the show. 'What are those? They are clothes. What are those? These are clothes. Wow!'

Pride: 'I'm so proud of how confident she is,' she said of North as she teared up

'Yay! I love you Penelope!' she added, pointing to pal Penelope Disick, eight. 'Yes, I love you. One, two, three!'

Afterward, Kim realized it had all gone better than planned.

'I'm so proud of how confident she is,' she said of North. 'She obviously gets that from her dad, and it just makes me so happy that she's not afraid to try anything.'

'You know, she's just so fearless, and I love that about her. And I'm such a proud mom.'

Now with dad Kanye on stage: 'You know, she's just so fearless, and I love that about her. And I'm such a proud mom,' said Kim

Kanye, 43, prepared for his Yeezy Season 8 show in the City of Lights, while Kim worried that the show might be canceled, or she might get sick due to COVID.

During the episode, she was seen getting fitted in a latex bodysuit sent by Balmain chief and friend Olivier Rousteing, before voicing her concerns over 'the virus'.

Speaking about the show in one of her confessionals, Kim said: 'Because the virus is so unknown, and you hear it just spreading, we didn't know if the fashion show was gonna happen. So our plans kept on changing every day.'

Fittings were delayed and clothes still being shipped, with everything running right up to the last minute, as Khloé , 36, and Scott Disick, 37, decided not to attend.

At the beginning of the episode, Kim extended an invitation to her family to attend Kanye's Yeezy show in Paris, and everyone seemed excited.

'Wait, have you guys heard about this new virus?' Kris Jenner, 64, interjected, as Kim said, 'Is it the corona one? Yeah. So, s***, so is it too scary just to be there?'

She reflected on whether she should make the trip. 'It is a little bit scary just thinking about traveling,' she told the cameras, 'because there's talk of the coronavirus circulating, and no one really knows a lot about it...

'But as of right now Fashion Week is still on, and I talked to so many friends and people that are in Paris and everyone feels super-comfortable, so I'm really excited.'

In the weeks leading up to the show, the news about COVID-19 grew more and more dire, and the family started to text back and forth about it on group chats.

'It's all of the links,' Khloé told Scott. 'MJ to Mom: 'They're shutting down Paris.'

She decided not to fly to the Yeezy show because she worried the Paris airport might end up closing, which would separate her from her daughter True, two.

Scott agreed, noting that while Kourtney Kardashian, 41, was taking his daughter Penelope to the show, he didn't want to go and leave his other kids with a nanny.

Khloé told the cameras, 'Kanye is my family and I will do literally anything to support him but more and more cases are coming out in Europe every single day, and I don't want to potentially get sick. I don't want to risk getting somebody else sick. And there's talks that if travel might be banned, and if we go to Paris, we might be stuck there. And I can't take that risk with my daughter.'

In the next scene, Kim and Kourtney were shown eating at a restaurant in Paris with their daughters, looking at photos of how big North had gotten since their last trip.

'I feel like we need hand sanitizer before we eat,' Kourtney noted.

That night, North and Penelope ate churros, rode a carousel and danced in their rooms.

The next day, their moms went to church in latex looks sent over by Olivier Rousteing at Balmain, with Kim calling hers 'the coronavirus suit—no one can get in here!'

She had wanted to wear the tight-fitting look to the Balenciaga show, but went to attend Kanye's gospel-infused Sunday Service at the Bouffes du Nord theater beforehand.

Afterward, she dined with Kourtney, Kanye and pal Fajer Fahad, and admitted that her plans to go to Paris had fluctuated all week as the news got worse.

'I almost walked off the plane,' Kourtney said, as headlines about 'designer masks' and cancellations at Fashion Week were shown.

Fajer said there was good buzz around the Yeezy show, with everyone trying to get invites.

That made her recall the first time Kim met Kanye after his second Yeezy show in Paris.

'I didn't know where to go,' Kim said, of arriving in the city alone. 'I was like, 'You guys, I don't know what to do! I want to get him a cake to celebrate. Don't they have a Ralph's here?'

She'd wound up getting a small box of pastries for Kanye, and got 'kidnapped' by Fajer and a friend, who took care of her.

Kim fretted for her husband, as she'd just learned that fittings were being pushed back for his show because of coronavirus, with items still being sewn and shipped over.

The night of the show itself, she, Kourtney and the kids rode to the event together.

'You wanna get some vibes and listen to some North music?' Kim asked her daughter, who shook her head. 'When are you gonna debut it to the world?'

'My daddy knows,' North said. 'I don't know.'

They got to the show at the Espace Niemeyer with only seconds to spare, and watched the models walk down the runway to the sound of cars honking—the show's 'soundtrack.'

All of a sudden North was onstage, singing, 'Oooh oooh,' as Kim taped her with her phone.

Musical North: 'My daddy knows,' North said. 'I don't know.'

In a confessional, she observed, 'I had no idea what the fashion show was going to look like in itself, but when Kanye asked North, 'Do you wanna sing?' I just… the nerves that I have now… '

Afterward, Kim and Kanye told North she'd done well, and Kourtney noted that the performance had been 'cool' to experience during such a tough time.

'You girls, put on hand sanitizer,' she told North and Penelope as they left the show.
