A university in China has been slammed by angered netizens as ‘homophobic’ after branding homosexuality as ‘unnatural and a psychological disorder’ in its health textbook.

Huaiyin Normal University in east China’s Jiangsu province made the statement in a ‘Health Education Handbook’ which were given out to all of its first-year new students, according to Chinese media.

The textbook also claims that gay people bring instability to society and they have shorter life expectancy than ‘normal people’ because they are ‘against the law of nature’.

The Jiangsu university came under fierce backlash after anonymous students shared pictures of the health handbook on Chinese Twitter-like Weibo on Monday.

A screenshot shows part of the textbook content in which it claimed homosexuality is ‘unnatural’ and ‘against the law of nature’.

‘Gay people are against the law of nature. They have personality defects and unstable emotions, [they are] more likely to commit suicide and harm others as a result of adverse consequences,’ the page read.

‘[They] cause instability in society. In one hand, it would cause conflicts because of the rejections and disapprovals from normal groups; in another hand, gay people would instigate and seduce normal people, causing threats to normal people.’

The so-called health handbook also said gay people have shorter life expectancy because homosexuality is a ‘psychological disorder that damages one’s nerve system’.

‘Gay people are more likely to use drugs because they cannot fit in nature and therefore they are easy to get lonely. They couldn’t resist the temptation of drugs,’ it continued.

The widely-shared screenshots sparked a heated discussion on Chinese social media, with many web users blasting the university ‘homophobic’.

One commenter wrote: ‘Are you serious? It’s 2020 already. This is pure discrimination.’

Another one said: ‘I can’t imagine a university with a group of highly educated people would say such ignorant words. I feel sick.’

But other Chinese commenters appeared to agree with the university’s statements.

One of them said: ‘What’s wrong with discriminating gay people? Aren’t we supposed to do that? Are we supposed to encourage and praise them?’

Another replied: ‘Isn’t homosexuality a mental disorder? Doesn’t make it right just because it’s legal in Western countries. They also legalised marijuana.’

A spokesperson from the university confirmed the incident with Shanghai-based news outlet The Paper, saying that they had asked students to return the textbooks.

‘[We] will appoint health workers to review the content again, to look through all of it again, and will delete the inappropriate sections,’ the staff member said.

The news comes after another Chinese university's guidelines warning women students not to wear 'revealing' clothes on campus 'to prevent arousing temptation' have whipped up online fury in the socially conservative country.

The recommendations were included in a 50-point safety guide issued by Guangxi University, which also urged women to avoid going out alone.

'Do not wear clothing and skirts that are overly revealing, low-cut, exposing your waist, or showing your back, so as to prevent arousing temptation,' the advisory note for new female students read.

Chinese authorities removed homosexuality from its list of diseases in the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders, a national clinical guide, in 2001.

But the LGBT community continue to face strong social stigma. Stories of families enrolling relatives in treatments seeking to change their sexual orientation also remain common.
