She is known for her love of glitz, glamour... and fake tan.

However, Married At First Sight star Elizabeth Sobinoff's excessively bronzed complexion in her latest smitten snaps with boyfriend Seb Guilhaus left her fans truly horrified.

The 27-year-old was ridiculed for her 'hideous' tanning disaster and was urged to embrace her natural beauty as she was reminded that 'beauty comes from the inside, not the outside'.

Despite sporting fake tan that was much deeper than her natural complexion, Elizabeth oozed self-confidence as she posed up a storm in snaps shared on Tuesday.

However, alarmed fans were quick to slam her appearance, with one noting 'the tan looks hideous' while another quizzed 'does she know how horrible that tan she is using is?'

Others advised her to feel confident with her natural beauty, with one saying: 'Omg stop with trying to look beautiful. She would look amazing if she didn't have a tan or stuffed her lips up. Beauty comes from inside not the outer.'

Someone else echoed: 'Less is more when dealing with fake tan.'

Another person jokingly quipped: 'Hope they don't have white sheets'.

Others offered a gentler approach to telling Elizabeth she had overdone her fake tan, with one saying: 'It's great to see her happy with seb. I like her toned down look a bit better.'

Another added: 'That's great that her and seb are still together they are so cute together her tan is too dark though, her natural complexion looks much better.'

In the offending snaps shared a day earlier, the star wore a glittering bustier top which highlighted her incredibly deep tan as she cosied up to her other half.

The reality star had locks brushed away from her face, and she emphasised her features with a glamorous coat of makeup and drop silver earrings.

Placing her hand on Seb's stomach and smiling for the camera, the beauty couldn't have looked happier.

She added the caption: '@Seb.guilhaus just want to say I'm proud of you and @glamourmakeupmirrors that light is bright!!!!!!! Poor Seb didn't know what hit him! Keep knocking your goals and growing beautiful boy.'

Elizabeth's smitten display comes after she added to her ever-growing tattoo collection on Saturday.  

Sharing a photo at a Sydney tattoo parlour, the TV personality revealed she has added a large design to her inked physique.

The brunette stunner proudly showed off her new tattoo, which was placed on her left thigh.

The design, which was placed alongside two previously-inked wolves, included a forest, mountain and moon inside a circle.

'Inked up again! Thank you Gillian for my new contribution to my collage. If you didn't know me you'd think I was cleaned skin,' she wrote.

Her beau Seb commented underneath her post, writing: 'Insert wolf howl.'

This comes months after Elizabeth revealed a huge new inking underneath her bust, as well as one on her back. 

Pulling up her black top, the brunette proudly showed off a bee and flower design across her torso, followed by a kookaburra on one side of her back.

In June 2019, she also got a comprehensive new inking, spanning from her back, down the side of her body, and to her thigh.

The sprawling design incorporating various animals was inspired by the children's book Possum Magic by author Mem Fox, and the TV show The Animals of Farthing Wood.   

Since meeting on Married At First Sight last year, Elizabeth and her boyfriend Seb recently relocated to Sydney where they are living as a couple.
