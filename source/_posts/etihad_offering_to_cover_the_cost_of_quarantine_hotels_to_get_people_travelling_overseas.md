Etihad Airways will cover the cost of hotel quarantine if travellers contract coronavirus while overseas in a desperate attempt to get people on flights. 

The 'COVID-19 global wellness insurance cover' is included in every Etihad Airways ticket travelling from September 7 to December 31. 

'Our COVID-19 global wellness insurance cover is an extension to your travel insurance, giving you extra peace of mind as you travel the world,' the airline said.

'If you're diagnosed with COVID-19 whilst you're away, we'll take care of your medical expenses and quarantine costs. No stress, no hassle. Simple.'

The national carrier for the UAE said insurance is valid for 31 days from the first day of travel. 

But Australians are unlikely to make the most of the safety offer, with overseas travel banned for another three months. 

Last week the Federal government announced the travel ban had been extended until at least December 17. 

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the decision came following advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.

'AHPPC has advised that the international and domestic COVID-19 situation continues to pose an unacceptable public health risk,' he announced on Thursday.

'The extension of the emergency period is an appropriate response to that risk.

'The human biosecurity emergency declaration ensures the Government has the powers to take any necessary measures to prevent and control COVID-19 and protect the health of all Australians.'

Cruise ships and regular international flights will remain suspended under an extension to the human biosecurity emergency period.

The overseas travel ban has been in place since March 18 and was due to end on September 17 before the three-month extension.

Australian citizens and permanent residents are banned from leaving unless they're a resident of another country, an offshore freight, boat, aircraft or essential worker or a government official.

Others can apply for an exemption from the Department of Home Affairs.

Following the latest national cabinet meeting last week, Mr Morrison said the cap on international arrivals would be revised. 

Some 4,000 Australians are able to return home each week under the current caps, with Sydney allowing the greatest number.

It's unlikely more flights will travel there, with Mr Morrison saying states had to help ease its load.

'We want to get more Australians home,' he said on Friday.

'And we need to do that safely as well, and not compromise the quarantine arrangements we have here as well.'

According to the Sydney Airport website, at least one Etihad Airways flight from Abu Dhabi arrives in the city each day.

Etihad Vice President Duncan Bureau said the safety and wellbeing of guests and employees remains a top priority during and beyond the flight.   

'This additional cover will not only instill confidence to travel but also reassure our guests that we are doing all we can to keep them safe and protected,' he said.  

'As more countries start opening their borders, we are making it as easy as possible for our guests to plan their next trip, hassle free.'
