A floating wedding chapel that was transformed into a luxury houseboat has been put on the market for $400,000.

The unique two-bedroom property is currently docked on the Manatee River in Palmetto, Florida. 

The vessel was formerly a wedding venue known as Chapel On The Bay but it has since been turned into an upmarket floating home.

More than $1,300,000 has been spent on the original construction in 2004 and subsequent conversion over the years but it still retains many of its original features including a 30-feet steeple, seven stained-glass windows and 19-foot ceilings.

She said: 'The interest has been extreme. I send the owner five to seven leads per month.

'We've had interest from people all over the world - from China and Australia and just about every state in the US.

'They are currently operating it as an Airbnb so you can try it out for a night.' 

The one-of-a-kind property was originally put on the market for $600,000 in 2017 and again for $425,000 in 2018.
