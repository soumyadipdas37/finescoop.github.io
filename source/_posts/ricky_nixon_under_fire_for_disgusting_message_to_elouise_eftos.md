Controversial former AFL player agent Ricky Nixon is under fire yet again after calling a young female comedian a 'fat ugly sl**' on Instagram.

Elouise Eftos received the disgusting message from Nixon on Thursday morning, just hours after her interview with Karl Stefanovic and Ally Langdon on the Today Show.

The 27-year-old comedian created a viral video earlier this week poking fun at the AFL for reportedly asking amateur dancers to perform for free on grand final day.

As part of her sketch she joked 'Ricky Nixon asked for my number. I think he wants to represent me'.

When Ms Eftos again poked fun at the disgraced former player agent on TV it did not go down well, with Nixon sending her a shocking direct message on Instagram - that she later shared on Twitter.

After tagging Nixon in a post on her Instagram, the ex-player agent responded: 'Fat ugly sl**'

'Aw Ricky I wish I was as fat, ugly and sl**y as you babe,' she wrote in her Tweet. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Nixon for comment.

Ms Eftos initial video poked fun at the fact the AFL had asked dancers to volunteer to perform on the final day of the season.

In her skit she joked that doing so herself had been a major boost for her career. 

'Things really changed for me after I danced at the AFL Grand Final for free,' Ms Eftos said in the video.

'It's amazing what the exposure has done for my life. Its changed it forever.

'So what I didn't get paid? Ricky Nixon asked for my number and I'm pretty sure he wants to represent me.'

After her initial joke about Nixon in her skit, she followed up by taking aim during her Today Show appearance.

When asked by host Karl Stefanovic if she had heard from Nixon, she replied: 'I didn't which is weird... maybe I'm too old for him?'

Her joke was seemingly pointed at his links to a Melbourne school girl in 2011.

Ms Eftos had initially joked about being 'too old' for Nixon, seemingly a reference to his much-publicised involvement with a Melbourne schoolgirl in 2011. Nixon always denied wrongdoing

Nixon was accused of being involved with then 17-year-old Kim Duthie, providing her with drugs and having sex with her in hotel rooms.

He always denied any wrongdoing. 

The pair had met after Duthie posted naked photos of three St Kilda players online.

The incident sparked the downfall of Nixon, a once goliath of the football world who represented star players including Wayne Carey, Jason Dunstall and Gary Ablett Snr.

Before becoming the game's biggest player agent, Nixon played 63 games for three AFL teams - Carlton, St Kilda and Hawthorn - between 1983 and 1993.
