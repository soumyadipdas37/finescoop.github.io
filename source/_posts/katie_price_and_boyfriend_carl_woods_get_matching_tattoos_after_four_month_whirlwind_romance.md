Katie Price and Carl Woods took their four month romance to the next level on Friday as they declared their love to one another by getting matching tattoos. 

The former glamour model, 42, and the car businessman, 31, were pictured heading to a parlour in Essex to get their matching inkings, which will take several weeks to complete. 

 Katie has a whole host of tattoos, including previous name tributes to ex-husband Peter Andre and ex-fiancé Leandro Penna- both of which she has covered up.

Carl winced as the tattoo artist got to work on inking Katie's forearm with the elaborate design. 

The television personality gazed into his eyes and held his hand as the artist got to work.  

While it is not yet known what Katie and Carl have decided to get, it is said the pair will have to go back to the parlour over the course of several weeks for it to be completed.

Upon arrival, Carl was every inch the doting boyfriend as he carried Katie out of the car and into the tattoo shop.

The mother-of-five has been left unable to walk as she continues to recover from six hour surgery on her feet after breaking them while she was on holiday in Turkey. 

Despite the agonising pain she is in, Katie had a smile on her face as they arrived for their tattoo session. 

The pair even sported matching outfits. Katie cut a casual figure in a white long sleeved top and grey jeans, with the star also sporting her plastic boot casts. 

Former Love Islander Carl, meanwhile, opted for a white T-shirt and ripped denim jeans.

Katie's latest tattoo will join her 12 other pieces of artwork, including a garter on her thigh, a crown for daughter Princess, 1,  and a rose which was used to cover up ex Pete's name on. 

The star hit headlines when she decided to put a giant X over Pete's name when their marriage broke down in 2009. 

Katie also once had the name of her model ex Leandro on her ankle, with the date they met but covered it up when they split in 2012. 

Other notable tattoos include red hearts and stars on her wrist in tribute to sons Harvey, 18, and Junior, 15, a bow on her hip to represent her loved ones 'tied together, and the initials H and J on the back of her neck.  

She also has a pony and ribbbon on her ankle, two other bow tattoos, a crown and microphone inking to represent 'self worth', a heartbeat on her right wrist and a heart with wings on her left wrist.
