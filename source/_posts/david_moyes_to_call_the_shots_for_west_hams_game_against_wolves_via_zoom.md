West Ham assistant manager Alan Irvine says David Moyes will take charge of Sunday’s clash with Wolves from home as he isolates following his positive test for coronavirus.

Moyes, Issa Diop and Josh Cullen were all forced to leave the London Stadium barely an hour before their Carabao Cup win over Hull on Tuesday after finding out they had the virus.

The trio need to remain at home until next Thursday, but Moyes will continue to call the shots in his absence via phone.

The Hammers boss was sent home from the London Stadium after testing positive for Covid-19

Irvine said: ‘David will be the manager and everything that we do will be run through him first of all.

‘He will make the decisions on everything that he would do if he was here. Nothing has changed as far as that is concerned but, like for this press conference, I am the messenger.’

Irvine added: ‘I spoke to both of the players and they are fine. They are frustrated because they are not able to come in but that’s the situation and we all understand that. Neither of them are feeling unwell which is arguably more frustrating.’

West Ham’s focus this weekend is on recording a first point after defeats in each of their opening two Premier League fixtures. They were poor in their opening loss against Newcastle, before getting nothing from a vastly improved performance against Arsenal.

‘It is another huge game,’ Irvine said. ‘We felt we certainly should have got something from the Arsenal game albeit we were disappointing with our performance against Newcastle.

‘We need a good performance against what will be a very good team and we have to try and get some points on the board as soon as possible.’

The game follows radio comments from co-owner David Sullivan in which he admitted West Ham might not sign anyone in this window.

Irvine said: ‘Like any other club we were coming into this window thinking we need to get some players, there are not many who think they have got exactly what they want so we are looking at ways to improve.

‘We would like to but you can only do that if the right players are available and at the right prices.

‘If we end up being unable to find those players, I don’t think it would be wise to sign players who would make the squad more unbalanced.’
