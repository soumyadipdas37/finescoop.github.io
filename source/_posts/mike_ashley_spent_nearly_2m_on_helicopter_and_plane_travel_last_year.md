Mike Ashley spent nearly £2million on travel by helicopter and commercial jet last year, accounts reveal.

The controversial Sports Direct tycoon, who is worth an estimated £1.9billion, has previously defended his use of the aircraft to commute to work.

Sports Direct owns a £5million navy AgustaWestland AW109 helicopter and spent nearly £40million four years ago on a Dassault Falcon 7X jet.

But Ashley’s extravagant travel bill of £1.9million in the year to April 29, 2019 – disclosed in accounts published by his firm Mash Holdings – was down from £2.1million the previous year. 

Ashley owns a 63.5 per cent stake in Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct International, through Mash. 

The company includes retail brands ranging from House of Fraser to, Flannels, Evans Cycles and Game. 

Annual revenues rose from £3.5billion to £3.9billion, accounts show, while profits rose from £20.9million to £185.4million.

Mash also warned about the impact of coronavirus, which had reduced sales after lockdown measures forced shops to close. 

But it said it had access to enough cash to weather the storm.
