An Adelaide driving instructor who passed a dodgy student and pocketed $450 for doing so is deserving of a bond or a suspended sentence, a court has heard.

Masoud Rad has pleaded guilty to one count of abuse of public office for passing the student who he clearly should have failed during a driving test in 2018.

In sentencing submissions in the District Court on Tuesday, his counsel said the former refugee had thrown away his lucrative business by his offending and would surrender his driving instructor's licence.

The court heard he deeply regretted his conduct and accepted that he should have carried out his duties without fear or favour.

Judge Patrick O'Sullivan was asked to consider imposing just a bond or suspending any jail term.

But prosecutor Gary Phillips said Rad's offending was serious, not because of the small financial gain, but because of the risk to other road users from people wrongly being passed as competent drivers.

He said that was indicated by the fact that the motorist Rad passed subsequently failed three more tests after having his initial licence revoked.

Judge O'Sullivan will sentence Rad later this month.
