Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in the BOSS show on Friday.

Romance: Hailey and her husband Justin are gearing up to celebrate their official second wedding anniversary on September 30

The Christian couple - who met at the 26-year-old pop star's 2009 concert meet-and-greet - are now moving into the $25.8M seven-bedroom Beverly Park mansion they bought in August.

Justin recently debuted the wholesome music video for his new song Holy featuring Chance The Rapper, which references his whirlwind romance with Hailey.

'Running to the altar like a track star / Can't wait another second / 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me / Feels so holy,' Bieber sang.

'They say we're too young and / The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin" / Wise men say fools rush in / But I don't know.'

Anniversary: It follows an informal picnic on September 13 to celebrate the day they got their marriage license in New York
