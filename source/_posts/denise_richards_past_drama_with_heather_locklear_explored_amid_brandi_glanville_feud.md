Denise Richards' past drama with Heather Locklear was brought back into the limelight on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season's reunion Wednesday.

Lisa Rinna, 57, who has been at odds with the Wild Things star, advised cast and viewers to search on Google for details about the drama between her Melrose Place costar Locklear, 58, and Richards, 49 - which traces to Bon Jovi alum Richie Sambora, 61.

Rinna said, 'I go back to when she was friends with Heather Locklear,' to which Richards said, 'I actually wasn't, Lisa, and you know that. To bring that up, really? She was friends with my ex-husband - now you're grasping at straws ... really?'

Details: Denise Richards' past drama with Heather Locklear was vaguely brought up on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season's reunion Wednesday, with problems between the two seemingly linked to their respective relationships with Richie Sambora 

Amid pressing from host Andy Cohen, Rinna refused to delve into further detail about the relationship between the actresses.

The bad blood started when Richards began dating Sambora after he parted ways with Locklear in 2006.

Richards, speaking with Entertainment Tonight in June of 2006, admitted that the situation was a complicated one, as it coincided with her own split from Charlie Sheen that same year.

'Heather, that’s been hard,' Richards told ET, according to People. You can’t help who you fall for and that friendship, unfortunately, was done and wasn’t salvageable.'

Sharing her side: Brandi Glanville has claimed that she got supportive messages from Heather Locklear amid her feud with Denise Richards

A post shared by  Brandi Glanville (@brandiglanville) on Sep 9, 2020 at 12:38pm PDT

The man himself: Appearing on Wednesday night's episode of Watch What Happens Live , Brandi, 47, told her story to Real Housewives producer Andy Cohen 

She noted the romance with Locklear's ex was 'the last thing [she] was looking for,' and that there was a public misconception at the tie that she and the Dynasty star were particularly close.

She said it had 'been tough having people think that [she's] such a crappy friend,' as Locklear 'wasn’t [her] best friend, but rather 'a close friend in the last couple of years.'

She noted that she and Sambora struck up their romance before either couple split, as 'didn't meddle in marriages and anything like that.'

Richards added more details about the nature of her relationship with Locklear to Redbook in 2008.

'I was no longer friends with Heather months before Richie and I got together,' she told the magazine. 'I don't want to say what caused the split, but she and I weren't even speaking then. It wasn't ever like we'd be shopping and go back to her house and I'd flirt with her husband.

'Yes, I got together with Heather's soon-to-be ex-husband, but no, I didn't have an affair with him. If Heather and I had been friends at that time, I would never have crossed that line. But we weren't.'

The way they were: Heather and Denise used to be close pals but their friendship broke apart in the late 2000s as their respective marriages collapsed; pictured on New Year's Day 2006

Acting: Heather and Denise even shared an on-screen kiss on Spin City

She added that her friendship with Locklear 'was not salvageable' and that she was aware of the potential backlash with the timing.

'I get why the public thinks I'm an awful person who stole someone's husband. But in my heart, I know I did not break up their marriage. If either Richie or I had felt our marriages were fixable, we wouldn't have crossed that line.'

Locklear is currently engaged to ex motocross racer Chris Heisser. She was legally married to Sambora from 1994 and 2007, and to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee between 1986 to 1993. Locklear and the Living On A Prayer musician are parents to daughter Ava, 22. 

The revelation came amid Brandi Glanville's claim that she got supportive messages from Locklear amid her feud with Richards. However she alleged that Heather is unwilling to discuss the actress on TV because Denise purportedly once sent her a cease and desist.

Appearing on Wednesday night's episode of Watch What Happens Live, Brandi, 47, told her story to Real Housewives producer Andy Cohen.

'Calculated #timing': Not only are the Real Housewives reunion episodes pre-taped, but apparently Brandi's Watch What Happens Live shot was filmed a day before its air-date as well

Ciao: Beverly Hills Housewife Erika Jayne, whom Denise has clashed with on the show, appeared to take an online dig at her after her exit made headlines

Although Brandi's interview aired Wednesday hours after Denise's rep told Variety she was quitting the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, it was taped the day before. 

The current Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills season has been roiled by drama involving Brandi's claim that Denise had an extramarital affair with her last April.

Denise celebrated her second wedding anniversary with Aaron Phypers this week and has consistently denied that the affair with Brandi ever took place.

'So Heather just reached out to me and said: "Thank you," with a bunch of hearts and prayers. And I was like, it just made me feel like I was probably bringing this side of Denise out for everyone to see. And I wrote back: "Of course. The truth always comes out." And she wrote a bunch of more hearts,' Brandi told Andy.

'And then I said: "Hey, you should be on Watch What Happens Live with me," and she said: "I've already had a cease and desist from Denise so I'm not gonna do it."'

Denise reportedly sent a cease and desist to Bravo to get the network to stop broadcasting material about Brandi's affair allegation.

She is also claimed to have sent similar cease and desists to co-stars as well as to Evolution, the production company behind the show, Page SIx reports. 

Months ago Brandi also wrote on Instagram that Denise 'sent me a cease-and-desist [so] I will not talk about her.'  

Star turn: Denise became a Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills in 2018 just three years after Brandi left the reality series after three seasons in the main cast

The ladies themselves: On the current season, at a group dinner in Rome, Denise blew up at her fellow Housewives whom she felt had relentlessly 'interrogated' her about Brandi's claim 

Denise's departure announcement from The Real Housewives OF Beverly Hills came the day that the second part of the three-part pre-taped season 10 reunion aired.

'The word of the night is calculated #timing #Are you f***ing kidding me,' Brandi tweeted Wednesday night.

Denise said on Wednesday's reunion episode that Brandi was 'not a friend of mine,' but on that night's episode of Watch What Happens Live Brandi said: 'We were definitely friends and more than friends actually.' 

Beverly Hills Housewife Erika Jayne, whom Denise has clashed with on the show, appeared to take an online dig at her after her exit made headlines.

Erika tweeted a Small Wonder GIF of a door slam along with the word: 'Bye' and a waving hand emoji.

Look of love: Denise celebrated her second wedding anniversary with Aaron Phypers this week and has consistently denied that the affair with Brandi ever took place

On the current season, at a group dinner in Rome, Denise blew up at her fellow Housewives whom she felt had relentlessly 'interrogated' her about Brandi's claim.

The meal deteriorated into a massive row where Denise slammed her co-stars as 'mean girls' and fled the table before a producer convinced her to come back.

This February she responded to an Instagram comment claiming she had an 'open marriage' and insisted that she is '100% monogamous to my husband.'

Last year the onetime Bond girl revealed that both she and Aaron got happy ending massages at her suggestion during their romance.

'If I was just doing it to make a splash, why would I not have done it last season? Then they would have brought me back full-time this season because they would have had a giant full f**king story line,' Brandi said in July of her allegations. 

She asserted to Us Weekly: 'I didn’t say it last season because I was worried that I was a cheater after she’s like: "Oh, Aaron’s going to kill me if he finds out." I thought: "What is she talking about?" That is bulls***."'

'I didn't say it last season because I was worried that I was a cheater after she's like: "Oh, Aaron's going to kill me if he finds out."'

The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills rose to be the 'top-rated cable program on Wednesday nights' amid this storyline, according to Variety.
