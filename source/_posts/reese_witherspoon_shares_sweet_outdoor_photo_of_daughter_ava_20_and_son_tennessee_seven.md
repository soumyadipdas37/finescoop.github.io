Earlier in the week, she shared funny photos of her youngest son Tennessee hanging upside down around the house as he went back to school online.

But on Thursday, Reese Witherspoon shared a more touching snap of the seven-year-old as he posed for a picture with his older half-sister Ava Phillippe, 20.

'My September babies,' the Hollywood star, 44, wrote in the caption on Instagram.

Virtual learning: A week ago, the actress and producer shared a photo showing herself and Tennessee sitting at a table in their makeshift classroom as they went 'back to school' online

A week ago, the Legally Blonde star had shared a photo showing herself and Tennessee sitting at a table in their makeshift classroom as they went 'back to school.'

She has been supporting her son as he continues his education via online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Monday, however, it seemed that homeschooling had gone off the rails a little bit. 

She posted three photos of Tennessee hanging upside down from different objects around the family home  in Brentwood, Los Angeles. 

'Home school is going great,' she wrote sarcastically alongside the pics.

Reese juggles caring for her family with running her production company Hello Sunshine as well as starring in a string of high-profile projects.

She also has her own clothing line Draper James.

Earlier this year, after lockdown started in LA, she shared candidly with Miley Cyrus that having everyone under one roof had its tensions. 

'I definitely have good days and bad days,' she said on Bright Minded: Live With Miley.

'I think it's really important to designate space,' she continued. 'My husband and I are both working from home and all three kids are doing school online. So everybody has a room that has a little area and there's a privacy sign there, so when the privacy sign is on and your headphones are on, you can't interrupt.'

She added: 'You have to have rules on the wall for your family, just so we respect each other's space.'
