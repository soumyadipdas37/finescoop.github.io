It's been one of the most explosive seasons of The Bachelor to date.

And now host Osher Günsberg has teased their could finally be a reunion show on the cards, after fans in their masses begged to see what happened next with Locky Gilbert and his winner Irena Srbinovska.

On Thursday, Osher posted on Twitter: 'If ever there was a season to do a reunion show, it would be this season. #TheBachelorAU.'

Could a reunion be on the cards? On Thursday night, host Osher Günsberg teased that one day such a show could exist, after fans in their masses begged to see what was going on with Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska (pictured)

A fan had responded to the Tweet, asking the host: 'Why no after the final rose or women tell all? The ending to the show feels like it’s incomplete #bachelorau.'

But Osher insisted that he'd pitched such a thing many times to Channel 10, saying: 'We pitch it every year, but we've only got it up a few times. #thebachelorau.'

Adding more fuel to the fire, Comedia Urzila Carlson wrote to Osher: 'Make it so!!! I want to be there in the room for it! I’ll quarantine again,'



'Wouldn't that be something?' Host Osher Günsberg made it clear he's been fighting for a reunion show 

'Wouldn't that be something?' Osher said he'd 'take a run' at trying to get the show going for season nine

To which he quipped: 'Wouldn't that be something? I'll take another run at if for season 9 ... #thebachelorau.'

The tease left fans hungry for a drama-filled reunion show - with many baffled why there isn't one in place already.

'Yes!! Please do an After the Final Rose. One of the best parts of the US bachie,' one wrote, while another added: 'Can we PLEASE make this a thing from now on. We need the drama.'



'Can we PLEASE make this a thing!' Fans were quick to agree with Osher, and begged for a reunion show to take place

The reunion would certainly make for interesting viewing, as Locky had told both Irena and Bella Varelis that he'd fallen in love with them before the tense finale aired.

And, like any season, rumours also ran rife that Irena and Locky had broken up after the show aired.

However, on Thursday night they did post a sweet video together seemingly confirming their relationship is still going strong.

'We're SO excited for the future,' Irena, 31, gushed. 'It's been such a long process and now we finally get to be together, and finally get to start our lives together.'

Locky, 30, added: 'It's been so long and now we finally get to tell everyone we're in love, and just get on with our normal life!'
