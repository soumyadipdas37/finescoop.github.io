Paris Saint-Germain star Marquinhos has jumped to the defence of team-mate Neymar after the Brazilian winger was accused of racist abuse during a match against Marseille. 

Neymar was sent off and banned for two matches for hitting Marseille's Alvaro Gonzalez earlier this month, with the PSG star accusing the Spanish defender of racial abuse towards him.

Gonzalez and Marseille now claim they possess evidence that it was in fact Neymar who made a racist slur during the match by calling defender Hiroki Sakai a 'Chinese s***'.

A Spanish TV network also accused the PSG star of making a homophobic slur, calling Gonzalez 'a f***ing queer' in the violent incident.  

Marquinhos, who plays with Neymar at both club and international level, claims the Brazilian is not the person to make these type of remarks. 

The 26-year-old told Le Parisien: 'I know Neymar, he is a person that never uses racist insults. 

'It is hard to say, because I was not on the pitch or close by and I have not seen the footage.

'But for anyone who knows Neymar, he never jokes around with words like that, and I believe he didn't do it.'

Marseille, meanwhile, refused to comment on the supposed accusations when questioned by AFP. 

A spokesperson for the Ligue 1 club said: 'We have no comment. We entrust all our expertise and analysis to the examiners of the league.' 

Neymar is set to return from suspension after two games out on Sunday night as PSG visit Stade de Reims in Ligue 1.

It will be the 28-year-old's first game back since the 1-0 defeat to Marseille on September 13, with Neymar one of three PSG players to receive red cards in the fiery encounter.

Layvin Kurzawa was handed a six-game ban for his role in the brawl while Leandro Paredes was given the same punishment as Neymar. 

On the Marseille side, Jordan Amavi and Dario Benedetto were given a three and one-match ban respectively.

After the match, Neymar vented his fury at Alvaro Gonzalez over the alleged abuse. 

The Brazilian attacker tweeted: 'You are not a man to assume your mistake, losing is part of the sport. Now insulting and bringing racism into our lives no, I don't agree.'

Gonzalez himself had tweeted: 'There is no place for racism... Sometimes you have to learn to lose and take it on the field. Incredible 3 points today. Allez l'OM. Thanks family.'
