Victoria has recorded 45 new coronavirus cases and four deaths as anti-lockdown protesters prepare to rally in Melbourne again.

The new cases reported on Friday come after the state's daily infections dropped to 28 on Thursday - the first time the figures have been in the 20s since June 24. 

The daily update comes as disgruntled Melburnians revealed they are planning to take to the streets again in protest of the city's lockdown restrictions. 

Deputy Commissioner Rick Nugent told 3AW's Neil Mitchell police received a warning email from a protester.  

'The organiser of the protest sent an email to us … advising us that if we refuse to allow them we will be jeopardising the safety of others and Victoria Police would be putting all Victorians at risk,' he said.

'Unfortunately, we're just going to have to continue to drag police off other functions and other roles to police these people in the city. 

It will be the third weekend protesters have gathered at inner-city landmarks to rally against the state government's Stage Four restrictions in Melbourne.
