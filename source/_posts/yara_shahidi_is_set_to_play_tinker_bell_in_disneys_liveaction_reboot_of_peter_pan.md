Disney has tapped Yara Shahidi to sprinkle a little bit of pixie dust as Tinker Bell in the upcoming live-action reboot, Peter Pan & Wendy, bound for theaters not Disney+. 

The 20-year-old Grown-ish star's casting makes her the 'first person of color' to portray the sassy sidekick of the film's title character, which has traditionally been played by a white actress, according to Deadline. 

The star-studded production will also include two-time Oscar nominee Jude Law, as  Captain Hook.

Over the weekend, Shahidi spoke about the importance of representation on television at the 2020 virtual Emmy Awards. 

'The stories we tell on TV shape how we see ourselves in others, and how we are seen can many times determine how we are treated,' she said during the virtual ceremony. 

She continued: ' 'The dream of television is the freedom to live our full and nuanced lives outside of boxes and assumptions. We continue to strive for a more complete definition of inclusivity.'
