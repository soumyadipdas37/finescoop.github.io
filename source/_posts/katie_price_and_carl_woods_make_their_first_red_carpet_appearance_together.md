She recently hit out at trolls who criticised her relationship with her younger partner.

And Katie Price made quite the statement with her boyfriend Carl Woods as they made their first red carpet appearance together at Shaka Zulu's 10th anniversary celebration in Camden on Thursday.

The former glamour model, 42, who broke her feet in a horrific freak accident on holiday last month, was supported by the Love Island star, 31, as they kissed and cuddled at the event.

Mother-of-five Katie was pushed along the venue in a wheelchair before attempting to stand to take cosy snaps with her beau. 

The TV star, who also sported a foot brace, caught the eye in a black slogan T-shirt and PVC trousers, which she styled with a series of silver chain necklaces.

With her blonde locks styled into loose waves, Katie complemented her features with heavy strokes of make-up.

Carl, meanwhile, looked handsome in an all-black outfit, featuring a long-sleeved top, skinny jeans and suede Chelsea boots.

Not mincing her words, the I'm A Celeb star said: 'I’ve heard every bit of abuse, insults and hurtful s**g naming calling under the sun from people who havent met me nor @carljwoods, I’m sick of small minded trolls trying to put us down. 

'I’m not a s**g I NEVER slept around being called a s**g is infuriating and cruel. There isn’t many guys that would be able to handle the life changing injuries I have. (sic)'

The businesswoman returned to social media earlier this month after taking time out to focus on her health following surgery on her two broken feet.

She revealed she feared her injury would leave her 'paralysed' after she plummeted 25ft off a wall at a theme park in Turkey and landed on her feet.  

The CBB star explained how her feet are 'destroyed' following the incident, and admitted she has returned to The Priory to learn to 'walk again.'

Katie, who was on holiday with Carl and her children Princess, 13, and Junior, 15, at the time, said doctors told her they have amputated legs with injuries similar to hers.

Speaking to The Sun, she said: 'The doctors said I'm lucky I'm not dead. I could have hit my head and I could have been paralysed, I am actually lucky I landed on my feet. 

 'I thought, "I'm never going to walk again". The doctors said they've cut off legs before after seeing injuries like mine.'
