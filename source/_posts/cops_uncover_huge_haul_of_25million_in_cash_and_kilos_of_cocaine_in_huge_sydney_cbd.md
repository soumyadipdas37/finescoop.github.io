A haul of $2.5million in cash and cocaine has been uncovered by police in a bust in Sydney's CBD.

Investigators searched a Volkswagen SUV in Haymarket at midnight on Thursday and found suitcases, boxes and bags containing more than $2.5 million cash and more than 2.5kg of cocaine.  

They also seized 30g of cocaine, $10,000 cash, casino chips valued at $1750, over $100,000 worth of watches, a money counter and documentation during a raid on a unit.  

All items seized will undergo further examination.

A 28-year-old man was arrested at the unit and taken to Surry Hills Police Station.

He was charged with knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime and supplying prohibited drug (large commercial quantity).

He was refused bail to appear at Central Local Court on Thursday. 

Organised Crime Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Martin Fileman, said the arrest is a testament to the collaborative effort of local police and specialist investigators.

'Today's results can be directly attributed to good old-fashioned policing, with officers from across the organisation working together to remove harmful substances from our streets,' Det Supt Fileman said.

'The cocaine that was found was broken into small amounts, clearly ready for supply in the community and with an estimated potential street value of $1.25 million.

'Anyone who choses to actively participate in organised criminal activities – including money laundering and drug supply – will be pursued by police and brought before the courts,' Det Supt Fileman said.
