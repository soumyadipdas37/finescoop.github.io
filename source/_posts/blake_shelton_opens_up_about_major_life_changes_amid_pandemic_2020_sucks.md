Blake Shelton opens up on Monday's edition of Ellen about how the pandemic changed the course of his life.

In the appearance, Ellen DeGeneres showed her gratuity to the 44-year-old country singer and his girlfriend Gwen Stefani, 50, for their support amid her career crisis surrounding a toxic workplace scandal over the past few months.

'Thanks for reaching out to me this summer, you and Gwen reached out to me when things were going a little bit crazy and I appreciate it very much, so thank you,' Ellen told the Oklahoma native who replied, 'Absolutely, we love you.'

The latest: Blake Shelton opens up on Monday's editor of Ellen about how the pandemic changed the course of his life, and how he and girlfriend Gwen Stefani hunkered down in his native Oklahoma at the time of the shutdown 

Ellen recalled to the Sangria singer, who has made frequent appearances on her show in the past, that the last time they had seen one another in person was at the Grammys in Los Angeles this past January.

'So I saw you in person at last at the Grammys and we both had high hopes and then we both lost,' Ellen told Shelton.

He replied, 'That was that the last time I saw you in person? Oh my gosh, I guess it was because it wasn’t long after that that none of us could see each other ever again right.'

Shelton joked of their empty night at the Grammys: '2020 sucks and I refuse to spend another minute sober!'

The God's Country performer reflected to Ellen about the quick change of pace that took place with the shutdown.

'We canceled my tour on March 12, like literally as we were building the stage for the production for that day in Omaha, Nebraska,' Shelton said, adding that Stefani was with him at the time as they were working on a video.

'We were supposed to be making some footage for a video for our single Nobody but You,' he said. 'We had a whole plan, we had a different camera crew out there filming these concerts and we only got to film one.'

Shelton said that upon the shutdown, he and Stefani headed back to his native Oklahoma, where they remained from March until late July. 

He said that the upside of the quarantine was that Stefani had a chance to see the beautiful nature in his native state in the three month span.

'She got to be there and actually see it from pretty much winter to spring to summer and see some seasons change,' he said.

Ellen, in her season 18 premiere earlier this month, talked about the scandal, and allegations her the show's work culture is rife with bullying, racism and sexual harassment.

'I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realize that with that comes responsibility, and I take responsibility at what happens at my show,' she said. 'This is The Ellen DeGeneres Show. I am Ellen DeGeneres. 

'We have had a lot of conversations over the last few weeks about the show, our workplace and what we want for the future. We have made the necessary changes and today, we are starting a new chapter.'
