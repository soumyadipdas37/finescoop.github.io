Molly-Mae Hague has revealed that she's been forced to avoid her Twitter account this week, after getting trolled over her £8,000 social media giveaway.

The Love Island star, 21, took to Instagram on Wednesday to reveal that she was giving away a massive haul of goods – including Louis Vuitton bags – as she celebrates garnering 1million YouTube subscribers.

However, she soon found herself to be the target of relentless trolling on Twitter, after several men complained that the competition post, which has been liked and shared more than 1 million times, was clogging up their feeds.

As the complaints ramped up on the micro-blogging site, the reality star and influencer clapped back, wryly tweeting: '£10 to any boy that’s not tweeted ‘£10 to any girl thats not entered Molly-Mae’s giveaway’..... terms and conditions apply x.'

However, on Saturday, Molly-Mae revealed that she'd all but given up on the platform, in a video shared with her fans on her Instagram Stories.

She said: 'I've been kind of trying to not look at Twitter too much just because even though it's meant to be a lovely thing and something we can all enjoy together people still have their mad opinions on it always.

Clapping back: As the complaints about her giveaway clogging up Instagram feeds, the reality star and influencer clapped back with a wry tweet

'I'm one of those people that do tend to read things and I do tend to let it get to me.

'But I just made this giveaway for something for us all to enjoy together, a way that we can celebrate having a million subscribers together and also a way for me to give back was the main thing.

'I wouldn't have any of this stuff without you guys, I wouldn't be able to do any of the things I do.

'Like even be where I am now in Milan, that wouldn't be happening without you guys, so it's just a way I can give back and say thank you, really.'

On initially announcing the competition, the blonde beauty wrote: 'I can’t put into words what this means to me. Since the age of 16 I’ve had this dream and goal in my mind and today we did it.... my mind is blown.

'Without you guys this dream would never have become a reality, so it’s only right that I give back. THIS IS MY CRAZY GIVEAWAY!!!! The thought of one of you receiving all of these things makes me so happy, I can’t wait to see who wins!

After sharing the terms and conditions – which included liking her post and tagging a friend, as well as subscribing to her YouTube channel and following her on Instagram – she also reiterated that the gifts were bought with her own cash. 

She concluded of the contest, which ends on September 20th: 'This giveaway is not a paid partnership or in any way an affiliation of any brands that are included. Everything included has been purchased by me for this giveaway for you all to enjoy.'

Molly-Mae's post comes after she recently revealed that she'd been harassed by a group of men while out shopping in her adopted hometown of Manchester.  



The television personality had been trying to film to a 'come shopping with me' video, but felt shaken when rowdy men began to name-call her.

She said: 'Guys I'm way too embarrassed to vlog out in public. I don't know what has happened to me. My confidence has just gone and I haven't vlogged in any of the shops because everybody is staring at me.

'I'm going to have actually put the camera down guys, I'm sorry. '

While waiting for a taxi, she said: 'Okay guys there are some men heckling me now.

'This is why I just cannot vlog in public guys, listen to this,' she said, as a man shouted 'oi blondie' in the background.

Feeling scared, she continued: 'I'm just going to ignore it, just ignore it. It's fine,' before picking the camera up again when she was safely in the car.

Meanwhile, Molly-Mae recently revealed it won't be long until she and her beau Tommy Fury, also 21, start a family.

The media personality was quizzed by fans about her plans to have a baby during an Instagram Q&A, where she told her followers she has always seen herself as a young mother.

When asked when they will try for a baby, Molly-Mae, who met Tommy in 2019, said: 'Probably not ages, like, I've always wanted to have a baby slightly younger anyway, so not going to be super, super old or not going to be super, super young.'

The blonde also answered the question: 'If you could meet Tommy again without the fame, would you?'

She replied: 'Well this is the nice thing about how we met, we met on Love Island and I didn't know who he was, he didn't know who I was. It was a really natural and nice way of meeting.'

Where it all began: The couple met during their stint on Love Island in the summer of 2019. They finished second-place to Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea
