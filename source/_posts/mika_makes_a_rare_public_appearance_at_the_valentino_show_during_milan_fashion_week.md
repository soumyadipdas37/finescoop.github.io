Mika made a rare public appearance as he attended Valentino's Spring/Summer 2021 show during Milan Fashion Week on Sunday.

The Beirut-born musician, 37, proved safety comes first as he sported a protective face mask to the star-studded presentation. 

Love Today hitmaker Mika, who was last seen on his worldwide Revelation tour earlier this year, cut a dapper figure in a sharp white suit, which he teamed with a plain T-shirt.

The award-winning songwriter looked suave in his smart two-piece, which featured a longline blazer and matching trousers.

Adding a touch of his typically edgy style, the pop star rounded off his appearance with patent black boots.

Mika recently held a I Love Beirut benefit livestream concert following an explosion which killed over 200 people in Lebanon's capital city last month.

The event boasted performances from Kylie Minogue, Salma Hayek and Danna Paola, Rufus Wainwright, Louane, Etel Adnan, Fanny Ardant and Laura Pausini. 

On the concert, songstress Kylie said in a statement: 'Mika and I have been friends for a while, so when he asked me to be part of his I Love Beirut project of course I said yes! 

'The situation in Lebanon is so sad, but I hope this event will raise lots of money to support the incredible work of Save the Children and the Lebanese Red Cross and their teams working on the ground in Beirut. I’m so happy to be part of it.'

Mika dominated the charts in the late 2000s with tracks such as Grace Kelly and Happy Ending, and released his latest album My Name Is Michael Holbrook in October 2019.

In 2012, the artist confirmed his sexuality in an interview with Instinct Magazine, revealing the tracks on his album The Origin Of Love are about his relationships with men.

The media personality told the publication: 'If you ask me am I gay, I say yeah. Are these songs about my relationship with a man? I say yeah.

'And it's only through my music that I've found the strength to come to terms with my sexuality beyond the context of just my lyrics. This is my real life.'
