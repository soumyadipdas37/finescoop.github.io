The Ellen DeGeneres Show is set to return to Channel Nine later this month, after the network finalised a deal with Warner Bros to bring the show back. 

Nine confirmed the news to Daily Mail Australia this week, saying the show will air from September 22 after a two-week break. 

The news comes amid the 'toxic' workplace scandal rocking the show, which is believed to have given Nine major bargaining power.

'The new season of The Ellen DeGeneres Show will air on Nine from September 22, we look forward to the show returning,' a spokesperson from the network said, after the news was first reported by industry website TV Blackbox.

Last month, the editor of TV Blackbox, Rob McKnight, said he believed the controversy surrounding the show came up 'at the perfect time during a negotiation period' and gave the broadcaster bargaining power. 

McKnight, a former senior executive at Nine, also told Daily Mail Australia at the time that Nine had the enviable position of being 'willing to walk away' from the deal as it refocuses its efforts on prime time.

'Nine are in negotiations and to bring the price down they're showing Warner Bros. that they're willing to walk away,' said McKnight.

'With the advertising market shrinking [due to the coronavirus recession], the focus is on prime time. I'm sure they'd like to keep Ellen, but this whole controversy has come up at the perfect time for them during a negotiation period. 

'They'll be taking a look at the ratings of Desperate Housewives in the Ellen slot and seeing whether it adversely affects them before they walk away from the deal.

'The fact is, this is all about getting the best deal for Nine. Controversies come and go, but at the moment every dollar counts.' 

McKnight also made the 'bold prediction' that The Ellen DeGeneres Show will continue to rate well in Australia and other overseas territories, despite the negative headlines.

'Ellen won't lose any viewers and will rate as well as she ever has,' he said.

'Here's the thing: her fans don't want to know the truth. They want to believe she is this kind and generous soul who wouldn't treat anyone badly.' 

McKnight's analysis came after Channel Nine chose to stop airing the U.S. talk show last month pending an internal investigation by WarnerMedia into accusations of racism, bullying and sexual harassment behind the scenes.

The network was instead airing reruns of Desperate Housewives - which previously screened on Seven - during Ellen's usual time slot between 12pm and 1pm.

'We are resting Ellen repeats on Nine and have replaced with Desperate Housewives,' a Nine spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia at the time.

Repeats however of the Ellen Show were aired on 9Gem. 

Warner Bros. Television announced last month that three senior producers had been fired from Ellen's show: Ed Glavin, one of the executive producers; Jonathan Norman, a co-executive producer; and Kevin Leman, the show's head writer.  

They were sacked as a result of the internal investigation into multiple allegations of a 'toxic' work culture behind the scenes of the popular daytime talk show.

Employees described a working environment rife with 'racism, fear and intimidation.'
