 Married At First Sight star Hayley Vernon has moved to Queensland. 

The 32-year-old is one of the many Melburnians making the leap to the Sunshine State following the Victorian capital's strict lockdown.  

On Thursday, Hayley was spotted arriving at Brisbane airport, where she was ushered off to quarantine for the next 14 days.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Hayley said she moved to Queensland for a new job opportunity. 

'Life in Melbourne got stagnant, who would want to live under the direction of Dictator Dan?' she said, referring to Premier Dan Andrews. 

'I needed to get out of there for my mental health,' she added.

Hayley went casual for the flight, wearing a tight-fitted long-sleeve black t-shirt and was COVID-19 safe in a surgical mask.

Off to quarantine: Hayley will now spend 14 days in quarantine where she will be continuously tested for the virus before going about her new life 

Earlier in the day, Hayley shared images of herself on the packed flight. 

Hayley posted an picture which showed dozens of passengers crammed into the centre aisle of a plane - with no social distancing in sight.  

She captioned the image: 'Jetstar - please use social distancing at airport. Also Jetstar - cramming flights for cash.'

Hayley has been outspoken in her views on Melbourne's lockdown laws - with her urging her followers to attend the anti-lockdown protest this month.    

'I'm calling on all activists, SJW's [social justice warriors], BLM protestors, pro-life choices, concerned Victorians, anyone! Join the walk in protesting our freedom,' she wrote.

'In this together Melbourne,' she added in another reminder post for the protest.

Star: Hayley only just recently joined website, OnlyFans. Hayley has already uploaded a number of raunchy photographs of herself 

Hayley - who joined the explicit adult streaming site OnlyFans last month - has been regularly accused of spreading misleading and false information about COVID-19 since it was declared a pandemic in March.

In July, she criticised Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews for making face masks mandatory in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.

'Why are we wearing masks? Us people who are healthy,' she wrote on Instagram. 'This as you said "is about curbing behaviour". I'll be dammed if you are going to curb anything about me.'
