Yazmin showcased her penchant for designer goods as she sported a Fendi fedora and matching bag, while also wearing a glitzy Chanel chain necklace.

Meanwhile, James mirrored his girlfriend's all black look as he opted for a sophisticated black short-sleeved shirt with linen trousers and espadrilles. 

It comes after Yazmin lifted the lid on her reunion with James during last Sunday night's episode of The Only Way Is Essex. 

She spoke to Bobby Norris and Nicole Bass about how she ditched her gal pal Amber Turner while on holiday to enjoy a romantic reunion with her then ex James.

Bobby quizzed Yazmin on their relationship and told her he'd heard 'through the grapevine' she had left Amber at a beach club and jetted off to meet James.

Confronting Yaz over the situation, he said: 'What I've heard through the Essex grape vine is that you skanked Amber at a beach club and jetted off to Mallorca to meet Lockie.' 

Attempting to explain herself, she retorted: 'So I was on my first girls' holiday ever with Amber in Ibiza and I think that kind of, not worried James a little bit...

'But he thought God she's moving on with her life and he was messaging me every day like come out here, so I took the first flight out to Mallorca.'

Appearing happy with herself, she told Bobby: 'And I've got to say it was the best decision I've ever made.'

Although the TOWIE gang have been separated due to lockdown, their is still drama brewing in Brentwood, as Amber tries to get to the bottom of Lockie's intentions with Yaz now they are back together.

Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted last month, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.

They looked as loved up as ever, showing signs they were on the road to returning to a fully fledged romance, with a source saying 'sparks are flying' between them.

At the time a source told The Sun : 'They're not officially back together but they're getting closer and everyone around them wouldn't be surprised if they got back together. 

'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'

Yazmin and James sensationally split last summer after rumours of cheating on his part - which he vehemently denied.

The couple displayed their turbulent relationship on TOWIE during their two years of being together.
