Sunrise star Samantha Armytage recently sold her multi-million dollar Bondi pad after getting engaged to Bowral businessman, Richard Lavender. 

And the 44-year-old has now revealed the details of her emotional move.

Writing in her Stellar magazine column on Sunday, Sam expressed that she was worried the stress of moving would overwhelm her, and tried to streamline her possessions by using the Marie Kondo method - 'does it spark joy?'

'I Googled ''how to move house without stress'' to get some tips. And they were: on moving day, lie down. Try not to cry. Cry. A lot,' she wrote.  

Despite being the busy anchor of a breakfast TV show, Sam said her country, 'control-freak' leanings meant she wanted to tackle packing by herself. 

In fact, she did most of the packing herself as opposed to paying for removalists.

Candid: 'Why do I wait 'til just before the removalist arrives to disconnect the TV and box the twenty-thousand cords connected to it these days?' Sam said

'In a last-minute panic I just jam it all in a cardboard box anyway,' she added. 

Sam admitted the move was more hectic than she would have liked.
