She was hospitalized in July after being found unresponsive in a hotel room in Los Angeles.

And in a lengthy Instagram post Monday, Tamar Braxton thanked God for giving her a 'second chance' at life.

The singer and TV reality star, who's 43, shared: 'God thank you for saving me! You know my true heart. Despite what the world may think of me, you kept me here for a reason. You are a God of second chances, and this second chance I won’t take for granted.'

Braxton wrote that she had been dealing with mental health issues 'for some time' and that it 'is not a joke'.

She said she had been putting all her time and love into her work, family and relationships and leaving nothing left over for herself. 

'I believe I have put a lot of time and effort in loving and giving my all to everything else but myself. I have allowed myself to stay in toxic situations including work environments,' she said.

'I’ve allowed my talents to be used for the wrong reasons. I have allowed myself to be used in too many “angry black girl” narratives. I’m not angry at all.'

Issues: In a lengthy Instagram post, the singer and reality TV star, 43, said she'd been dealing with mental health issues 'for some time' and wouldn't take her second chance 'for granted'

While not addressing specifics of what she has been through during the past several months, Braxton explained: 'I’ve realized in this time that the only thing I can control is the things I own. I want to personally fight for brown girls to have more ownership and not just be a slave to the industry. Black women are the unvalued and unprotected.'

She concluded: 'I am on a never ending battle to be the best Tamar Braxton I can be. God has brought me through a lot so I would like to pass it on to use my voice to help brown women and ALL women in these similar situations. We all have the opportunity to evolve. For now on it’s me vs me.'

Braxton was rushed to hospital on July 16 after being found unconscious in her room at LA's Ritz-Carlton Hotel by then boyfriend David Adefeso.

She was then transferred to a hospital facility in Los Angeles where she received treatment from mental health specialists, The Blast reported at the time. 

Earlier this month, Adefeso was granted a restraining order against Braxton after he alleged she had attacked him while a passenger in a car he was driving and threatened to have him killed'

She is required to stay at least 100 yards away from the 49-year-old, his car and his place of work, TMZ reported.
