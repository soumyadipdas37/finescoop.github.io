Amanda revealed in a new interview that that she is writing a book about her late husband Nick Cordero's final health struggle.

Nick was hospitalized with COVID-19 in March and eventually tested negative for the virus but still underwent a series of health complications and died July 5 at age 41. 

'Yes, I’m writing a memoir about this time, and I’m writing it with Anna Kloots, my sister. It’s about everything I went through, and about positivity and faith and resilience,' Amanda explained to the New York Times.

'I started writing when I was in Ohio, with my mom and dad, right after Nick passed. I’ve actually found it to be incredibly therapeutic.'

During the same interview she shared what she hopes her one-year-old son Elvis will inherit from his late father. 

'I want our son to be curious because Nick was very curious,' shared Amanda, a fitness trainer, to New York Times.

'I want him to know Nick struggled to make his dreams come true and he never quit. I want him to know his dad was a hard worker,' she said.

'And I’d love for him to know about all the people that he touched, the lives that he touched, and what a good guy he was,' Amanda revealed.

Nick spent 95 days in the hospital and had a string of medical crises including holes in his lungs, two mini-strokes and a blood clot that led to a leg amputation.

Amanda revealed that 'at night' she will occasionally 'rack her brain' about why exactly the illness affected him so badly.

'It’s not fair. He was getting better. They were almost going to take him off the vent,' she said in her latest interview.

'And then he got a terrible infection in his lungs and his fever spiked, his blood pressure dropped, his heart stopped and he died for two minutes, and that was the start of the spiral down. It just felt like he could never catch a break.' 

She also shed some light on her determination to retain a positive attitude, saying: 'I can’t be in a hole in my life right now, because I have a beautiful little boy that relies on me. And on top of that, it’s what Nick would want me to do.'

Amanda noted: 'There are parts of every day that I get sad, and there are parts of every day where I cry. But I also have to find the little things throughout the day that make me happy, or else I know I won’t survive.'

Part of what keeps her spirits up is that her one-year-old is 'the cutest little thing. And he’s a very happy little boy.' 

'He never quit': 'And I’d love for him to know about all the people that he touched, the lives that he touched, and what a good guy he was,' Amanda revealed 

She said: 'Even when I want to be sad, he’s just so cute that you end up smiling and laughing. He looks like Nick, and he has a lot of Nick’s personality. I can already tell.'

Shortly after Nick died Amanda shared a glimpse of a letter she had written to Elvis about the tragedy that had befallen their family.

'I miss him so much. I miss his voice, hugs, kisses, smiles, silliness. I wish quarantine would have been the three of us together every day,' she wrote. 

'We must look for the silver linings in life son. Life is never perfect, things happen we will never understand. Look for lessons, keep moving, find the beauty.'

'I would pray so hard': In her new interview Amanda shared that as a nondenominational Christian 'I don’t know how I would have gotten through without my faith and prayer'

In her new interview Amanda shared that as a nondenominational Christian 'I don’t know how I would have gotten through without my faith and prayer.'

She recalled that 'there were so many times in the hospital, or on a phone call, when I was talking to the doctors, and they would tell me Nick wasn’t going to make it - they would tell me he has an hour or two left to live.'

Amanda said: 'And I would pray so hard because it’s how I was able to help. And he would live and he would fight and he would hold on.'

She added: 'But one of the times that that happened, I was praying, and I said: "God, thy will be done. I will never understand if you take him. But it isn’t my will, it’s your will." It helped me in the hospital, and it helps me today. It’s not that the hospital didn’t do enough. It’s not that I didn’t do enough. It’s God’s will.'
