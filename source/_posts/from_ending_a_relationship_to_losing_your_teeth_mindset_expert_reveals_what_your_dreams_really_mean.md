Mindset expert and clinical hypnotist Claire Aristides has shared what common dreams really mean and how they could relate to your emotions and everyday life. 

Some dreams often involve falling, losing your teeth, being naked in public and dying - all of which can have a deeper meaning.

'Dreaming is a way to connect to the subconscious mind; dreams are natural, healthy and can be metaphorical to what an individual is feeling or experiencing,' Claire, from Sydney, told FEMAIL.

'I would encourage people to not feel frightened of dreams or think that they're negative, but instead see them as a gateway or outlet to your unconscious mind.'

She said metaphors are a 'very good way' to understand or decode what is happening in our dreams, mind and lives.

Claire has also released a free Mindology app to calm and empower the mindset through visualisation and self-hypnosis.

Falling

One common dream thousands of people experience is falling, which Claire says might occur as a result of feeling lost or unsafe.

'Dreams don't always mean the same thing for every person, but falling can be a metaphor for feeling out of control, falling out of touch with someone or falling into the unknown and feeling unsafe,' she said.

'This could also signify leaving something behind or separating from something that you might be drifting away or holding you back.'

Losing your teeth

Similarly to falling, dreaming about losing teeth could signify feeling lost or losing control.

Claire said it's important to draw on what's taking place in everyday life in order to understand a dream.

'Losing your teeth can relate to stress, anxiety and feeling like you're not in control of a situation,' she said.

Being naked in public

Dreaming of being naked in a public place is common and can link to feeling exposed or caught out.

'This often relates to the fear of others pointing out your insecurities, failures and flaws - which is something no-one wants,' Claire said.

'This type of dream can also be tied into an individual's self-esteem levels, guilt or being caught out.'  

Falling - feeling out of control, separating from something, feeling unsafe

Dying - change is occurring, end of a chapter or phase in life, something new is starting, stress

Losing your teeth - stress, anxiety, feeling like you're not in control

Chopping off your hair - change, making a big career decisions, stress, something is changing in your life

Being naked in public - self-esteem issues, fear of flaws and insecurities being exposed to others

Ending a relationship - stress in a relationship, mindset exploring response to a possible situation

Drowning - feeling overwhelmed, not coping, stress

Being chased - feeling frightened, fearing something or someone, escaping

Dying

Dying in a dream can signify change is about to happen, or and ending is taking place.

'Death represents an ending - whether it be the ending of a chapter in their life, separating from a relationship or ending a phase,' Claire said.

And with death, or the end of a chapter, ideally beings a new journey for the person to embark on.

Claire said while dying in a dream may be frightening, it can indicate a positive aspect and change to someone's life too.

Ending a relationship

When we dream, the muscles in our body are relaxed but the mind and brain is still very active.

And because dreaming strongly links to how an individual is feeling, this gives the mind an opportunity to play out certain situations.

Claire said if a person dreams of ending their relationship with their partner, this may be because of stress, issues, other factors, or sometimes nothing at all.

'Dreaming gives the individual a chance to react to a situation in their minds, or think about something differently,' she said.

'The power of the imagination takes what a person has experienced over the last few days and uses it when dreaming, but alters or creates situations.'

Being chased

When people dream of being chased, this can reflect the fear of change, being frightened or escaping something.

'Children, teenagers and adults can dream of being chased for multiple reasons, and fear itself can evolve into a character that can start to chase you in a dream,' Claire said. 

'This can link to fearing something at school, work or change in general.' 

While cutting your own hair or shaving your head in a dream isn't as common as others, this might be metaphoric to stress of a particular situation

Cutting your hair 

While cutting your own hair or shaving your head in a dream isn't as common as others, this might be metaphoric to stress from a particular situation or change.  

'The hair is a metaphor for something - which will vary from person to person,' Claire said. 

'It could be a metaphor for making a career decision, personal change in your life or letting go of something.'
