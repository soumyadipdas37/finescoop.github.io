Lisa Armstrong has named her new cosmetics range after the pals who supported her following her split from Ant McPartlin.

The makeup artist, 43, has joined forces with Avon to release her own line of beauty products, which will launch on Monday, and has chosen some of her pals' names to feature on her lipsticks.

Lisa split from Ant in 2018 after 12 years of marriage, and is now reported to be dating James Green.

Tribute: Lisa Armstrong, 43, has named her Avon cosmetics range after the pals who supported her following her split from Ant McPartlin

A spokesperson for Avon told The Sun: 'Lisa's partnership with Avon is the exciting co-creation of her new professional make-up collection following Lisa's 20 years in the beauty industry.

'Lisa's lipsticks are named after close friends that are independent women who have supported and inspired her.'

A source also told the publication that Lisa learned 'who her true friends were' after splitting from Ant as they supported her through her divorce from the presenter.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Lisa Armstrong and Avon for comment.

Over: The couple split in 2018 after 12 years of marrage, and their divorce was finalised in April (pictured together in 2017)

Lisa and Ant finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 following the presenter's highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol.

The Saturday Night Takeaway star has continued his relationship with his former personal assistant and girlfriend of two years, Anne-Marie Corbett, 43.  

However last month Lisa appeared to confirm that she was dating her new lover James, after fans reached out on Twitter to congratulate her on the happy news.

Exciting: Lisa has joined forces with Avon to release her own line of beauty products, which will launch on Monday, and has chosen some of her pals' names to feature on her lipsticks.

Her follower tweeted: 'Just love the fact that, A. Your Career continues to soar. B. You have a handsome good man who clearly cares for you (Finally).

'I wish you...... Love, life and magic in all you do.'

Rather than denying the relationship rumours, Lisa retweeted the message for her followers to see, adding three kiss-blowing emojis, and added: 'Thank-you Kathy xx.'  

The blonde is said to have met James before lockdown but started seeing him properly once restrictions started to ease. 

New man? Last month Lisa appeared to confirm that she was dating her new lover James Green, after fans reached out on Twitter to congratulate her on the happy news.

Ant and Lisa first met in 1994. At the time Ant and life-long TV partner Declan Donnelly were reaching new TV and music heights as PJ & Duncan following their stint on Byker Grove. Lisa was in a band called Deuce at the time.

The pair met in the 1994 Smash Hits tour in Newcastle, where Lisa's Deuce performed alongside Ant and Dec's musical alter-egos.

They started dating and were together for over ten years before Ant decided to take it to the next level, proposing to Lisa while on holiday in Dubai in 2005.

They were married in 2006 on July 26 at a country house hotel in Buckinghamshire. Dec was Ant's best man.

In that time, Deuce split and Lisa retrained as a makeup artist, ultimately working her way up to become head of makeup and hair for BBC's Strictly Come Dancing.

In 2013, Ant and Lisa spoke about their struggles to conceive, telling Radio Times: 'Lisa and I would love to have kids. We're trying. It's tougher than you think when you get a bit older.' 

The TV star also revealed that he wasn't holding off from having children until Dec, who at the time was single at the time, was with someone.

'There's a rumour that we do everything together and I'm holding off having kids till Dec finds himself Mrs Right. I love that idea, but I'm afraid it's not true.'

Happier times: The pair made a public appearance when they attended Dec's wedding to Ali Astall, where Ant returned the favour and served as Dec's best man

He also told Fabulous Magazine: 'I think I'm lucky. Lisa works in the industry and understands it. She's constantly working – sometimes more than me!

'We would love to have a family so fingers crossed. If we're blessed with children, then we'd be over the moon!'

The pair made a public appearance when they attended Dec's wedding to Ali Astall, where Ant returned the favour and served as Dec's best man.

Lisa frequently supports Ant and his lucrative TV career, most recently attending the 2017 National Television Awards—just 12 months before the couple announced their separation.

In June 2017, Ant went into rehab for alcohol and drug addiction. 

In a statement to The Sun at the time, Ant said: 'The first step is to admit to yourself you need help. I've let people down. I'm truly sorry. I feel like I have let a lot of people down and for that I'm truly sorry. I want to thank my wife, family and closest friends through this really difficult time.' 

Lisa took to Twitter to thank the support her husband received: 'Completely overwhelmed by all your love & support it means so much. I'm relieved he's receiving the help he needs, we just need him better.'

Ant then told the Sun about the impact his addiction had on Lisa: I've put Lisa through hell with mood swings and depression and how it affects you. I'm very sorry about the effect it has on partners. This kind of stuff puts strains on any marriage. All I can say at the moment is that she's been amazing — fantastic throughout.'

In autumn 2017, rumours of a split emerged after Lisa didn't accompany Ant to Australia for I'm A Celeb, something which she quickly denied, pointing out she has a job and hasn't been to Australia for years.

On January 14, 2018, the couple announced that their 11-year marriage has ended.

The couple announced their split in January when a representative said: 'In response to the recent speculation in the media, Ant is very sad to announce that, after eleven years, he is ending his marriage to Lisa McPartlin.

In March 2018, Anne-Marie Corbett, the couple's personal assistant was seen giving Ant a packed lunch outside his house. She accompanied him to his court date in April.

The pair continue to be seen over the next several months, and in June 2018, having revealed that she didn't know Ant and Corbett were dating, Lisa accused Ant's new girlfriend of 'breaking the girl code' by dating the TV star. 

In October 2018, just days before their divorce application was granted, Ant was seen holding his phone, which has him and Corbett as the screensaver.

Their union legally came to an end during a 30-second hearing.

In November 2018, the pair were said to be fighting over custody of their pet labrador, Hurley  

In January 2020, Ant and Lisa were said to have finalised their divorce deal 

Ant agreed to hand over £31m to his ex-wife in the settlement, including their £5million former marital home in West London

The couple will share custody of pet dog Hurley
