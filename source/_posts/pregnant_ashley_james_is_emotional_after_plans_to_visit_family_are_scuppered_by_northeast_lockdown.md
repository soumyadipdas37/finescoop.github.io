Ashley James was left feeling emotional on Thursday after the Government's imposed lockdown in the north-east means she will be unable to see her family.

The former Made In Chelsea star, 33, who is pregnant with her first child, took to Instagram to reveal she had planned to visit her loved-ones with partner Tom Andrews next week. 

However, after Boris Johnson announced those in the north-east will be unable to socialise with others from outside their household and with a 10pm curfew imposed, Ashley had to cancel the reunion.

With a sarcastic thumbs up selfie, Ashley wrote: 'Cheers to the government for locking down the North East a week before I was meant to be going home to see my family given that I can't go home for Xmas because of the due date.

'Really delighted that I haven't seen my parents/ gran all year and they've missed my entire pregnancy, and there's no cases at all around them. Cheers.   

'Also really pleased Tommy won't get to meet my siblings. At least we can go sit in the pub with loads of strangers or go house hunting.'

It comes after Ashley slammed Boris Johnson over Covid-19 rules that force women to give birth alone and without their partners. 

The television personality told MailOnline she expected more from the Prime Minister after he became a father again in April when fiancée Carrie Symonds gave birth to a baby boy.  

Ashley, who is expecting her first baby in January with boyfriend Tommy Andrews, 30, said the current ban on partners at the bedside during births has left her feeling 'apprehensive' but she's trying not to over worry for the sake of her unborn child.

In an exclusive interview, Ashley said: 'The thing I am most apprehensive about, which again we can't change, is what's going to happen with Covid and whether Tommy is going to be allowed in the hospital.

'The frustrating thing is that people are allowed to go to the pub and get on tubes and go to offices. 

'Why can't you have one person from your household in something like labour?

'You would think as well that Boris would be sympathetic towards that given his partner has just had a baby.   

Rules: The DJ has been let down by new government guidelines that restrict families to only meet in groups of up to six people, after hoping to visit her loved ones this weekend 

'I'm sure if it had been him that had the baby and had to go through labour then he would have thought a bit more about it.

'There isn't really much point in me worrying because it is what it is.'

It was reported on Sunday that more than 60 MPs are now demanding NHS Trusts lift the ban, as new mothers have been left 'devastated' over having to give birth without loved ones by their side.

The Mail on Sunday launched a campaign this weekend to stop the practice, which has also led to patients being forced to attend stressful hospital appointments on their own.
