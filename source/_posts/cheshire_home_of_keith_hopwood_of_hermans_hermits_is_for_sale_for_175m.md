From the outside, it paints a picture of a peaceful, quintessential English countryside home with sash windows and landscaped gardens.

The Grade II listed property sits in 10 acres of land in Cheshire with Beeston and Peckforton castles in the background.

But the inside of this property for sale has proved to be far less sedate, having seen its fair share of a rock 'n' roll lifestyle over the years.

This is because, for the past three decades, it has been owned by the 1960s rock star Keith Hopwood - of the band Herman's Hermits, which rubbed shoulders with The Beatles and sold more than 80million records in the late sixties.

Mr Hopwood has a music studio at the property and famous faces that have walked across its floors include Jason Donovan, Stacy Solomon, and Neil Morrissey.

Mr Hopwood has lived at the property called Hulgrave Hall for the past 30 years and has now put it on the market with a guide price of £1.75million via estate agents Jackson-Stops.

Aside from the band, Mr Hopwood founded a successful music company called Pluto Music, which is behind the sound tracks for shows such as Bob the Builder and Roald Dalh's The B.F.G, which were composed from the studio at his home. 

Those who have used the studio include Neil Morrissey as Bob the Builder.

Mr Hopwood exclusively told MailOnline Property: 'What was once a Georgian farmhouse for a working farm has become the most fantastic home for my family and I over the last 32 years. 

'Moving from Manchester originally, I had struggled to find a home that ticked all the boxes of being able to accommodate our whole family, having a fantastic outdoor garden and entertaining area as well as having the ideal space to house my own studio for work. 

'When I saw this property with all those features I knew it was too good an opportunity to pass up.

'One of my favourite parts of the house are the gardens and grounds that provide beautiful views towards the neighbouring castle. It's something our visitors always remark on and was certainly appreciated by Jason Donovan who once strolled the grounds while warming up his voice ahead of a recording.'

He went on to explain how 'long before any celebrities visited this home, the former owners had famous racehorse Red Rum stay in the stables'. 

'The property boasts an incredible history and if these walls could talk I'm sure they would have some fantastic tales to tell,' he said.

'The location is perfect, with acres of green in sight, yet an easy commute into London and neighbouring villages. 

'We're sad to be leaving but I'm sure that the next homeowners will love this home just as much and continue to add to its fantastic history.'
