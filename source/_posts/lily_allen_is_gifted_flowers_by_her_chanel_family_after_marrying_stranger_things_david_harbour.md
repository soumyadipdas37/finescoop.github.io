Lily Allen has been gifted with a beautiful bouquet of flowers by her pals at Chanel after tying the knot with David Harbour on Monday.

The singer, 35, revealed she'd been sent a pretty collection of roses by her friends at the designer brand after announcing she'd married the actor at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas.

Lily sported a chic 60s-inspired dress by Dior as she exchanged vows with David with an Elvis Presley impersonator acting as the officiant.

Dijay told MailOnline: 'Lily‘s wedding ring is beautiful and compliments her engagement ring perfectly. 

'Her ring is a classic diamond set wedding band with approximately 25 round brilliant cut diamonds held together perfectly in a micro-claw setting.'

He added: 'This type of slightly wider diamond wedding band is becoming increasingly popular paired with slim engagement ring bands.' 

The singer and her actor beau married at the famed Graceland Wedding Chapel on Monday after obtaining a marriage licence to wed in Sin City.

Wedding bells: Lily and David tied the knot before enjoying a takeaway dinner from fast food chain In-N-Out with her daughters Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven

In snaps shared from the ceremony, Lily opted for a short 60s-inspired Dior dress to exchange vows with a suited and booted David, before celebrating their union with dinner at the fast food chain In-N-Out.

The pair were joined by Lily's children Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven, as they tucked into their fast food outside.  

Lily opted for a short white double-breasted dress with a bateau neckline, black buttons, and a belted waist teamed with black suede platforms heels and a small bouquet of pink flowers. 

A black version of the dress is currently priced at $4,300 (£3,306).

David went onto share a pair of snaps from their nuptials, including one mere moments after the union outside the chapel. 

Referencing their laid-back nuptials, David penned the caption: 'In a wedding officiated by the king himself, the people’s princess wed her devoted, low born, but kind credit card holder in a beautiful ceremony lit by the ashen skies courtesy of a burning state miles away in the midst of a global pandemic.

'Refreshments were served at a small reception following.' 

The Graceland Wedding Chapel was the first chapel to conduct an Elvis-themed ceremony in 1977.

Found on the famous Las Vegas Strip, the 70-year-old chapel conducts weddings and vow renewals.
