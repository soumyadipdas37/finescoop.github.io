During the years in which the show is set, Prohibition was in force in the States and cocktails like mint juleps became popular to disguise the taste of bootlegged spirits. 

If formidable Aunt Polly, the matriarch of the Shelby clan (Helen McCrory), drank one she'd have given it a twist – this one has peach brandy.

For 1 glass – Preparation: 5 minutes

Place the mint and sugar in a cup and crush. Fill with crushed ice, add the whiskey and brandy, stir and garnish with fresh mint.
