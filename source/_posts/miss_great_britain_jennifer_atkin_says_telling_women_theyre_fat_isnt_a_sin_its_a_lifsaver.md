You’d never know to look at me now — especially wearing my sparkly tiara and the sash proclaiming me to be Miss Great Britain — but just three years ago I was classed as ‘severely obese’ with a body mass index (BMI) of 40.

How did I go from dangerously overweight to beauty queen?

It started when a nurse, who had just completed my annual asthma check-up, delivered the killer blow: ‘You’ve put on a lot of weight over the past few years, Jen, and it’s a concern,’ she said, looking serious. 

Jennifer Atkin was given a scare when a nurse told her she was 'severely obese' three years ago, sparking her decision to turn her life around and lose around 8st. Pictured, Jennifer when she weighed 18st, left, and this year wearing her Miss Great Britain tiara, right

While she was having her annual asthma check-up, a nurse said to her: ‘You’ve put on a lot of weight over the past few years, Jen, and it’s a concern. Pictured, Jennifer at her heaviest, before her dramatic weight loss

‘You are obese and really need to eat less and move more if you want to avoid getting to the point when you might need a gastric band.’

Despite weighing 18 st at just 22, it had not occurred to me until that moment that weight-loss surgery might ever have to be a consideration for me.

And, although I admit my initial reaction to the shock was to comfort-eat a bar of chocolate and a packet of crisps, the nurse’s words were a wake-up call. 

They changed my life in ways I could never have imagined, setting me on a path to losing 8 st and, ultimately, being crowned Miss Great Britain 2020.

Had the nurse not been brave enough to speak up five years ago, I might now be on my way to a lifetime of health complications and even premature death.

So when I hear people call for the banning of terms such as ‘obese’, because a growing movement says they are ‘fat‑shaming’, I consider it to be dead serious — and dead wrong.

Jennifer said the words from her nurse shocked her, stating that despite the fact she weighed 18st at just 22, it had not occurred to her until that weight-loss surgery might ever have to be a consideration. Pictured after she lost several stone

She took the nurse’s words as a wake-up call and made it her mission to drop the pounds, leading to her eventually competing and winning Miss Great Britain 2020

The British Psychological Society believes we should now refer to people as ‘living with obesity’, rather than ‘obese’, thereby removing any inference of personal responsibility.

Obesity is a complex condition, not merely the result of ‘eating all the pies’, as my tormentors at school used to assert. 

Pretending it’s not happening, however, is not the way to tackle it. It’s ludicrous to conclude that using medical terms such as ‘obese’ is the same as nasty bullying. Far from being a term of abuse, obese is a scientific measure of a person’s weight. 

When your BMI — a figure calculated by measuring weight against height — exceeds 25, you are clinically overweight, and when it reaches 30, you are classified as obese. Saying a person with a BMI of over 30 is obese is, therefore, no different to calling a table a table.

Not that all medical professionals get it right. Take the nurse who, after fitting my contraceptive implant in my early 20s, said: ‘You should lay off the biscuits.’

Her advice was not clinical, it was humiliating. I walked out with my cheeks ablaze. But if every attempt to help someone lose weight is labelled ‘fat-shaming’, then few people will ever go on a diet.

With 67 per cent of men and 60 per cent of women in the UK overweight or obese — and with heart disease, diabetes and cancer all serious risk factors from obesity (each one a condition which, incidentally, makes people more susceptible to complications from Covid) — this is a ticking timebomb set to put even more strain on the NHS.

Yes, of course it’s wrong to deliberately humiliate anyone. But we are also doing a huge disservice to those whose health is at risk if we shy away from telling it like it is: only by taking in fewer calories than our bodies burn can we reverse obesity.

Speaking from her own experiences, Jennifer, pictured after her weightloss, suggests the proposal to ban the term 'obese' could be damaging - as after being told she was told it she was motivated to lose the weight she had gained

I used to have a full English in the morning, a bar of chocolate as a mid-morning snack, a ready meal for lunch, plus fizzy drinks, crisps, pasties, takeaways and wine most evenings. The local Chinese knew my order off by heart.

Luckily, I decided to do something about it. I cut out all that stuff and replaced it with a yoghurt for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch and a piece of chicken with a baked potato and cheese for dinner. 

I wasn’t adventurous back then because I couldn’t cook, but it worked. The weight dropped off, initially at a rate of 8lb a week.

Practice nurses could play a vital role in this process if they were encouraged to make regular, motivating calls to those trying to lose weight. 

Being able to boast about losing a few pounds might be all the motivation some people need to make a change. 

But, instead, I fear a counter-culture is developing — one that glamorises carrying huge amounts of excess weight under the banner of ‘body positivity’. 

Social media is full of women, like Jonathan Ross’s daughter Honey, professing to be ‘big and proud’.

As a society, we need to stop confusing this with a debate about people’s looks. This isn’t about whether you can be ‘fat and beautiful’ — I’d say without hesitation that you can. 

But there is no getting away from the fact that being obese damages organs and can knock years off your life.

This is why it’s vital that NHS professionals stop getting tied up in knots worrying about causing offence, and start focusing on reversing this crisis.

I’d love to see the Government offer financial subsidies similar to the Eat Out To Help Out scheme. It could introduce a far healthier Work Out To Help Out alternative, making a contribution to the cost of gym membership and personal trainers to get people to start exercising. 

And lessons in how to make healthy meals should be compulsory throughout your school years, and free for concerned adults, too.

Friends and family, worried about a loved one’s weight, should suggest going for a long walk or cooking a healthy meal together.

Only one of my friends ever addressed the issue of my weight, telling me she worried about my health. Although I was shocked, I now feel grateful for her concern.

It was harder to deal with when, shortly after that asthma check-up, my then-fiancé ended our relationship, partly, I believe, because of my size.

I was devastated at the time, but as I’m now happily married to Chris, 31, a mechanical engineer, he definitely did me a favour.

I had no idea the impact my body size was having on my life until I slimmed down. I used to be so tired and would catch every cold going. These days, I have plenty of energy and my asthma has vanished.

Plain speaking about my weight may literally have saved my life. We can’t deny other women the same opportunity.
