They've been shooting scenes for the upcoming series of The Only Way Is Essex.

And the new episodes look to be as explosive as ever as Amber Turner and co-star Nicole Bass engaged in a very heated row during filming in Essex on Thursday. 

Amber, 27, appeared to bump into Nicole, 28, during a shopping trip before the pair got very animated.

Disagreement: TOWIE's Amber Turner engaged in a very heated row with her co-star Nicole Bass during filming for the show's new series in Essex on Thursday

The blonde beauty looked furious as she spoke to Nicole, who was seen raising her hands in frustration during the intense chat. 

At one stage, co-star Chloe Meadow, 27, was seen trying to break up the chat from a distance while Clelia Theodorou looked shocked over the scenes.   

During the argument Amber put on a leggy display in a white shirt dress which she layered with a tweed blazer adorned with pearl buttons.

Intense: The blonde beauty looked furious as she spoke to Nicole, who was seen raising her hands in frustration during the tense chat

Tense: The chat descended into a row between the two reality stars during filming on Thursday

The reality star finished her look with a pair of suede knee-high heel boots and styled her blonde locks into a blow-dried hairdo. 

The hit ITVBe reality series resumed filming last month after production was halted in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Amber has been in an on-off relationship with her co-star Dan Edgar since she joined the show two years ago.

Stepping in: At one stage, co-star Chloe Meadow, 27, was seen trying to break up the chat from a distance while Clelia Theodorou looked shocked over the scenes

Friends: Clelia appeared upset by the scenes that unfolded between two of her friends during filming 

But Amber and Dan have been stronger than ever after spending lockdown together.

The couple rekindled their romance in May last year after a brief split which saw the Lothario pursue a relationship with his co-star Chloe Sims, 37.

The blonde beauty previously talked about how Dan has become a 'changed man' since they gave their romance another go.    

Argument: Nicole looked upset during the confrontation on the street with her friend Amber 

Stylish: During the argument Amber put on a leggy display in a white shirt dress which she layered with a tweed blazer adorned with pearl buttons

Amber told The Sun: 'Sometimes you have to go through really low points in life, and Dan admits what happened was a real low for him. He lost me. I was gone and he wasn't in the best place.

'When you lose someone it makes you realise how much you want them and need them in your life, he's not someone in their mid-20s anymore, he's mature and serious about life.

'Obviously joking around, but he has had his mid-life crisis already. Now he's such a changed person. He's so happy and focused on his future. I'm excited for the future with him.'

Fashionista: Reality star Amber finished her look with a pair of suede knee-high heel boots and styled her blonde locks into a blow-dried hairdo

Tension: Although it was not clear what the argument was about, all will be revealed in the new series airing later this month
