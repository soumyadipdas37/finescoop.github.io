They married in December 2019 and welcomed their first child together in April.

And Joshua Jackson, 42, called the last 12 months the 'happiest whirlwind of my life' as he paid a gushing tribute to wife Jodie Turner-Smith on Monday to mark her birthday.

The Affair star shared a stunning photo of the 34-year-old actress on Instagram as he wrote: 'Happy Birthday my beautiful wife. Thank you for choosing to share your light with me. Thank you for walking this path of life as my wife.

'Thank you for bringing our daughter into the world. This last year has been the happiest whirlwind of my life. I can’t wait to see what all the years to come bring our way.'

The couple married in December and a month later they revealed they were expecting their first child together when Jodie showed off a visible baby bump on an outing in Los Angeles.

Reps for the couple confirmed on April 21 that the couple had welcomed their daughter Janie with the Queen & Slim star celebrating the news on Twitter two days later.

'I'm a mother!' she wrote at the time and also thanks fans for their well wishes and congratulations.

The Neon Demon actress added, 'feel like i ran a marathon today — that delirious feeling of pride in your accomplishment and also like where is the nearest hole to crawl inside and sleep till next year?'  

Earlier this week Joshua affectionately posted a social media snapshot of his wife breastfeeding their firstborn child.

The acting couple were first linked in 2018. They were seen wearing wedding rings back in November, but it wasn't until December that they confirmed they had secretly wed.
