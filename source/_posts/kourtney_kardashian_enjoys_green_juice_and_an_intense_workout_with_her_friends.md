Kourtney Kardashian caught up with some of her longtime pals over green juice, ahead of a grueling workout at her 12,000-square-foot Calabasas mansion.  

While the fit 41-year-old reality star has documented a number of her grueling sweat sessions under quarantine, she proved they really aren't for the faint of heart on Wednesday. 

After training with Don-A-Matrix, the mother-of-three filmed her friend, JJ Corsini, catching his breath, after she revealed his 'first workout with the crew' made him vomit.

'Don't film me, I've never puked working out before, ever,' her pal grumbled, as two men, including Harry Hudson, could be heard joking it wouldn't be the last in the background. 

Despite sharing footage of both Hudson and Corsini, the Poosh founder did not share any pictures of Travis Barker, who she tagged on her Instagram Story.  

For their meeting, the raven-haired beauty sported a pair of form-fitting black leggings and a baseball cap, which read: 'Be Kind.'

In the snap, she appeared to be wearing minimal makeup, as she displayed her flawless complexion and signature pout.

Her $55 graphic hoodie also spread a message of positivity, as it was emblazoned with the message: 'I'm happy you're awake today.'

While Barker, who is the drummer for the rock band Blink-182, and Kardashian have previously sparked dating rumors, the pair have always maintained they're 'just friends.' 

'Kourtney's like a dear friend. That's it,' the performer told told People last March. 'I mean, I love her to death. I love her family to death. But yeah, just friends' (seen in 2019)

The 44-year-old shares three children with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler: son Landon, 15, stepdaughter Atiana, 19, and daughter Alabama, 13. 

Meanwhile, Kardashian is a mom to ten-year-old Mason Dash, Reign Aston, five and Penelope Scotland, eight, from her past relationship with Scott Disick.

She and Disick, 37, dated from 2006 to 2015, and recently sparked speculation they were trying for another baby.  

In a teaser for her family's reality show, her sister, Kim, asks if they were 'serious' about wanting a 'fourth' child.  

The exes have certainly been spending plenty of time together with their kids during quarantine, after he split with girlfriend Sofia Richie, 22, back in May.

But a source told HollywoodLife that they're strictly co-parents: 'So much time has passed since they have been in a romantic relationship and they are not interested in rekindling it. 

'They are just trying to be good parents and if that means they hang out more together, that is totally something they can figure out. They are very happy to be in each other’s lives forever even if it doesn’t return to a deeper love connection that they had in the past.'
