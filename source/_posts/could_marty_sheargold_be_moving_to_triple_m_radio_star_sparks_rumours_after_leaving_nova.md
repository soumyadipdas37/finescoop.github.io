During the announcement, he explained to his co-hosts Kate Ritchie and Tim Blackwell that he 'spent the last 'four or five months tossing up' what to do in 2021.

'Kate, Tim and Marty will no longer feature Marty at the end of the day,' he said on-air. 'Thank you to the network for having me, putting up with me.

'Over the last four or five months I've been tossing up what I'd like to do in 2021, and what I've decided to do is leave the show,' he added.

In an official statement, Marty thanked his co-hosts for their support in his decision.

'I've had a fantastic 10 years with the Nova Network, having worked with buildings full of talented and dynamic people,' he said.

'I'd like to thank Tim and Kate for their support of my decision and wish them continued success with the show.

'Now feels like the right time for me professionally to keep challenging myself and to embrace future opportunities with renewed vigour and enthusiasm.'

While he's yet to reveal his next move, Radio Today understands a podcast and a return to his comedic roots may be on the cards.
