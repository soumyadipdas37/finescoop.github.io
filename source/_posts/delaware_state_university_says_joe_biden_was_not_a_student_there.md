Joe Biden said last year that he kicked off his academic career at Delaware State University, a historically black university, but the institution has now denied that claim. 

The Washington Times reported that a spokesperson for Delaware State University said the Democratic presidential nominee was never a student at the school, but he did make two appearances for commencement speeches. 

'Vice President Biden did not attend DSU,' Carlos Holmes, Director of News Services, told the publication.

'However he was the Commencement keynote speaker in 2003 and [2016], and during the former he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree.'

Delaware State University is one of 107 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) open in the US and is ranked No. 11 on the US News & World Report HBCU rankings.  

The institution sits about 50 miles south of the University of Delaware, where Biden graduated in 1965 after he double majored in political science and history. 

Biden made the declaration before the South Carolina Democratic primary - which he won by a landslide - during an October 2019 town hall event at Wilson High School in Florence

The high school was founded in 1866 by the Freedmen's Bureau for black children seeking an education after The Civil War's resolution. 

'I got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State — now, I don’t want to hear anything negative about Delaware State. They’re my folks,' Biden told the crowd.
