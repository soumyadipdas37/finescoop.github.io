An elected official in California has urged the salon owner at the center of the Nancy Pelosi's mask-less blowout saga to reopen her business in a different county after being forced to shut down due to threats. 

Erica Kious, who has lived in San Francisco for 15 years, revealed earlier this month she was closing her ESalon SF following the controversy surrounding Pelosi's visit. 

Kious had said she was forced to close because she was now too afraid to do business in San Francisco after receiving death threats. 

She revealed earlier this week that she didn't know when or where she would open up another salon. 

Bonnie Gore, who is an elected official in Placer County, subsequently wrote to Kious saying the county would welcome her with open arms if she wanted to reopen there.

'As an elected official, I am disheartened to hear about your recent experience in San Francisco with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, at your salon,' Gore wrote in the letter that she later posted on Facebook. 

'I cannot image the heartbreak you have experienced during Covid-19 especially since your business and livelihood have been completely upended in the past few weeks. 

'While you may already know your next destination, I would like to invite you to consider setting up your next salon here.

'Our arms are open to hard-working small business owners.' 

Placer County is about three hours from San Francisco.

Kious and her salon became the subject of national headlines after Pelosi was seen flouting pandemic health guidelines inside the business on August 31 when she received a blowout. 

Pelosi argued that she was 'set up' by the owner but Kious has denied those claims and called them 'absolutely false'.

Pelosi said she had been to the salon several times over the years.

'I take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighborhood salon I've been to over the years many times, and when they said we're able to accommodate people, one person at a time, and that we can set up that time, I trusted that. As it turns out, it was a setup,' she said. 

'It was a set up, and I take responsibility for falling for a setup.'

Since the incident, a petition demanding Pelosi be prosecuted for 'COVID violations' was launched. 

A GoFundMe was also set up in support of Kious, which has raised more than $336,000.  

Many quickly deemed Pelosi a hypocrite for flouting face mask guidelines after criticizing Trump for not wearing one.

When he was pictured in one in July, she said: 'He's crossed a bridge. So hopefully by his example, he will change his attitude, which will be helpful in stopping the spread of the coronavirus.' 

Also in July, Pelosi announced that all members will be required to wear a mask when voting on the House floor. 

She said failure to wear would be 'serious breach of decorum' for which members could be removed from the chamber.

'It's a sign of respect for the health, safety and well-being of others present in the chamber and in surrounding areas,' she added.

Meanwhile, Trump spewed attacks against Pelosi on Twitter as he questioned how she would fare in global negotiations given claims the incident was a 'set up'.

'Nancy Pelosi said she got 'set up' by the owner (a very good one) of a beauty parlor,' Trump wrote.

'If so, how will she do in negotiations against President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, or Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Not so well, I suspect, but far better than Joe Hiden' would do!'
