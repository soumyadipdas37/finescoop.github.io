Middlesbrough have completed the signing of former Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom for £2.75million.

Akpom played for PAOK in a Champions League qualifier against Besiktas last month

He will be at the Riverside Stadium on Saturday to watch his new team play Bournemouth in the Championship.

'I'm delighted to finally have got him,' said Boro manager Neil Warnock, who will coach his side against Bournemouth via Zoom following a positive Covid-19 test.

'He's been my No 1 choice. I've wanted him for a long time. I'd like to give a big thanks to [chief executive] Neil Bausor for getting it done.

'I told him what we were doing at the club and right from day one he wanted to come and I'm delighted.'

Akpom spent two seasons with PAOK in Greece, helping them win a league and cup double

The forward previously played for Arsenal, making 12 appearances for the Gunners' first team

London-born Akpom joined Arsenal at the age of six and worked his way through their youth ranks.

He made 12 first-team appearances for the Gunners in all amid a succession of loan spells at Brentford, Coventry, Nottingham Forest, Hull, Brighton and Sint-Truiden.

Arsenal sold Akpom, who represented England up to under-21 level, to PAOK in August 2018.

He played a key role in their first Greek Super League title win in 34 years and scored the only goal in their cup final win over AEK Athens.
