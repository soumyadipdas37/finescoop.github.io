She is known for her fit physique crafted after years of professional dancing. 

And Julianne Hough stepped out for a hike on Friday with her trusty dog leashed to her waist. 

The 32-year-old former Dancing With the Stars pro was spotted out in Los Angeles flaunting her toned abs in a blush sports bra and matching workout leggings.

She teamed her look with black sneakers and a grey sweatshirt she kept in hand, as she headed out with friends. 

Julianne was sure to don a face mask, amid the coronavirus pandemic, though she tucked it under her chin as she sipped from a plastic cup. 

The star went fresh faced and left her golden brown/blonde hair down in a messy do, parted in the middle. 

Julianne has been finding ways to stay active as the pandemic has left gyms closed in Los Angeles.

Earlier this week, she gave fans an insight into her training methods on Monday by sharing a snap of herself working out.  

Partially exposing her cleavage, Julianne flashed a peace sign while exercising in what appeared to be a makeshift home fitness studio. 

The American star had evidently worked up a sweat during the gym session, and she revealed a flushed complexion worked on her cardio. 

Julianne previously took to her Instagram Story with a glimpse at her morning routine, which included lemon water, 'morning pages,' breathwork, meditation and an obligatory workout.

The Dancing with the Stars alum launched her holistic movement experience earlier this year, and has been offering virtual classes amid COVID-19.

She told Us Weekly in May: 'With so much uncertainty in the world today, it’s easy to feel a bit lost and isolated.

'Now more than ever, people are searching for deeper human connections, and at its core the Kinrgy philosophy guides us to our inner knowing, that it all starts from within.' 

Late last month, she sparked reconciliation rumors with her estranged husband Brooks Laich as they enjoyed a friendly lunch.

The couple split up in May 2020 after nearly three years of marriage, but Julianne celebrated her 32nd birthday with him in July.   

There have also been reports the duo are thinking about getting back together.  

While Brooks initially felt 'humiliated' and refused to consider the possibility of a reunion, he's now coming round to the idea of repairing his marriage, according to E! News.

'At first Brooks was not open to reconciling,' a source said. 'It's been a very fluid situation. They still love each other, and the lines of communication are open.'
