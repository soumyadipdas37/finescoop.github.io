She puts on a showstopping display on a daily basis. 

And Amanda Holden was working all her best angles as she strutted into work at Global Studios in Leicester Square on Thursday morning.

Hot stuff: Amanda Holden was working all her best angles as she strutted into work at Global Studios in Leicester Square on Thursday morning

Amanda looked sensational as she headed to work in her stylish ensemble which combined girly elegance with a touch edge. 

Her envy-inducing black saddle bag complemented her leather jacket and strappy heels perfectly while she kept things chic with sunglasses. 

Meanwhile, Amanda confirmed that COVID-19 won't put a stop to Britain's Got Talent's return in 2021 - which will be the show's 15th season

She also pointed out that she turns 50 next year - and has laid out her ideas for a joint celebration.

Amanda said: 'I’m really excited because 2021 is happening in whatever format it’s going to be in,' she confirmed. 'That will be 15 years we’ve been going - and I’ve been there for all of them! So hopefully, there’ll be a party!'

She added: 'I also turn 50 next year, so I’m expecting a joint birthday! In fact, as a present I think I should be able to press all the golden buzzers!'

Amanda and her co-judges - Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon - returned to screens this weekend for the first time since the pandemic put a stop to production on the current series.

Excitement: Amanda said: 'I’m really excited because 2021 is happening in whatever format it’s going to be in,' she confirmed. 'That will be 15 years we’ve been going - and I’ve been there for all of them! So hopefully, there’ll be a party!'

Chatting: The Kiss Me Kate actress said: 'Being a meter apart will be annoying because we’re a very emotive judging panel and we hug one another if an act has been particularly emotional and set one of us off crying

The show resumes over September and October after a lengthy wait, with social distancing now in place and no studio audience.

The Kiss Me Kate actress said: 'Being a meter apart will be annoying because we’re a very emotive judging panel and we hug one another if an act has been particularly emotional and set one of us off crying.

'It’s going to feel very odd explaining to all our kids that they can’t come and hang out backstage.'

The semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October.

As usual, Ant and Dec will host, and Ashley Banjo will replace Simon at the judges’ desk, after the head judge broke his back in LA three weeks ago during a bike accident.
