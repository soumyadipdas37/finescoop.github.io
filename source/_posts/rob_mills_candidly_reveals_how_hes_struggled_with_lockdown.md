Former Australian Idol star Rob Mills has bravely opened up about how he's struggled with lockdown in recent months, leading him to turn to booze and even struggling to get out of bed.

The 38-year-old actor, singer and media personality revealed this week how he became 'stuck in a rut,' as he throws his support behind the Alcohol and Drug Foundation's national health campaign, Break the Habit. 

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, Rob said how he made the conscious decision to turn his life around by doing Dry July and drinking less.   

'I didn't want to get out of bed': Rob Mills candidly revealed this week how he's struggled with lockdown and became 'stuck in a rut' after having no work and turning to alcohol - and how he's turned his life around

'I was just going through the motions and found myself caught up in a routine of unhealthy habits of drinking more, scrolling aimlessly on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and obsessing over the solutions to COVID-19,' Rob said, being based in Melbourne which is enduring it's second lockdown. 

'None of these things were good for me. They made me feel increasingly angry at the world. A lot of days, I just didn't want to get out of bed. I couldn't see the point.'

Rob said that he reconnected with old friends to help him get by and cut down his alcohol intake, saying it has helped him 'find joy again'.

'For me, drinking less was an important step in getting out of the hole I felt caught up in,' Rob said.  

He added: 'Drinking less helps me feel more present, and I can't be that way when I'm smashing loads of drinks.'

He said that 'moderation is key' and that now he no longer needs 'extremes' in his life.

Rob previously spoke about his decision to participate in Dry July to help raise awareness for cancer, after he lost two friends to the disease.  

Posting on Instagram at the start of July, the former Australian Idol contestant vowed to give up alcohol for a month.

In a lengthy post, Rob said he was 'sad' and tired' as he opened up about the loss of his mates.

'I'm tired. And I'm sad. There seems to be a lot of sadness around at the moment from BLM [Black Lives Matter], COVID, the arts...' he wrote.

'I lost two friends to cancer. Forty-eight and 38 years of age. Michael Falzon and Joe Sassone.'

Vowing to go 'booze free for the month', Rob asked that donations be made to the Cancer Council.

He then announced that he would also give up social media for a month or 'maybe longer' in order to shed light on youth suicide.

He also urged his followers to donate to The Reach Foundation.
