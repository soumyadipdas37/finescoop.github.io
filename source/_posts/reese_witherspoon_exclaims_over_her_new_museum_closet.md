Reese Witherspoon is showing off her incredible collection of memorabilia in the first episode of Netflix's new home organizing show, Get Organized with The Home Edit.

The seres, which follows The Home Edit founders Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin as they visit the homes of celebrities and normal people, premiered with a bang on Wednesday, kicking off with a visit to the home of Legally Blonde star Reese, 44.

Reese has the pair organize years of red carpet dresses and pieces she kept from movie and TV sets like Legally Blonde and Big Little Lies, and is clearly in awe when she walks into her completed 'mini Reese museum.'

New show: Reese Witherspoon is showing off her incredible collection of memorabilia in the first episode of Netflix's new home organizing show, Get Organized with The Home Edit

Welcome! The Home Edit founders Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin visit her at her Nashville house

Keepers: She shows them some of the dresses and other fashion items she has kept over the years, which she wants to display in an extra closet

Memories: Among the red carpet pieces she's kept over the years are a beaded Versace dress she wore while pregnant at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012

Fave: She also still has the yellow Nina Ricci gown she wore to the 2007 Golden Globes

Ta-da! Reese proudly shows off the Armani Prive gown she wore to the 2011 Oscars

Iconic: She also still has some items from her Legally Blonde days, include a Bruiser toy and the outfit she wore on the movie poster

'This is my dream project that you guys would come and help me organize my memorabilia from all my movies, my dresses, my clothes, my costumes, pictures — everything,' she says

It's appropriate that Reese should appear in the series premiere, as it's her Hello Sunshine production company that executive produced the show.

New show! Netflix debuted the new series this week

'This is such an exciting moment in our lives. Honestly, we've been dying to do a project for Reese for years,' says Joanna. 

The home visit begins with excited hugs between Reese and the Home Edit founders, as Reese welcomes them into her newly-renovated home in Nashville.

'We just renovated it, and we just moved in this week,' Reese tells them. 'It's a lot of blue and white and a lot of wallpaper.'

In fact, the entryway where they're having the conversation is covered in a blue-and-white patterned wallpaper, with a dark blue door opening to the outside. In a sitting room behind them are several beautiful mismatched blue chairs can be spotted.

But Clea and Joanna aren't organizing these rooms — they are getting into Reese's closets, where she keeps her red carpet gowns and the pieces she has taken home from movies and TV shows. 

'I have extra closets, and this is my dream dream dream project that you guys would come and help me organize my memorabilia from all my movies, my dresses, my clothes, my costumes, pictures — everything,' she tells them.

Reese explained that she connected with the women on social media.

'I met them on Instagram. I DMed them because I thought they were so funny. I love their relationship with each other, and I also love female partnerships.  

Ready for some clothes! She shows them the empty closet in her newly-renovated house

'I had all of my costumes in storage for years and years, and I thought, this is the perfect place to put them,' says Reese

Empty: The room starts out completely empty and pristine, all white with lots of shelves, drawers, and places to hang things

Get going! It gives Clea and Joanna a blank canvas to work with

'Our house goals for Reese's memorabilia closet are to divide the closet into sections relating to her various wardrobe from movies, TV shows, her red carpet moments,' Clea explains

'I've been very lucky in my career to have great female partnerships from Nicole Kidman and Kerry Washington to Jennifer Aniston, so I love working with teams of women and seeing how they work with each other.

After some chit-chat, Reese takes them to the closet she's had built: The room starts  out completely empty and pristine, all white with lots of shelves, drawers, and places to hang things.

'I had all of my costumes in storage for years and years, and I thought, this is the perfect place to put them,' says Reese.

She next takes them to a room filled with boxes and racks of stuff, and walks them through some of the highlights.

Among the red carpet pieces she's kept over the years are a beaded Versace dress she wore while pregnant at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012, a yellow Nina Ricci gown she wore to the 2007 Golden Globes, and the Armani Prive gown she wore to the 2011 Oscars.

All done! After spending hours working, they show off the 'mini Reese museum' they created

Beautiful! Above all, it's incredibly neat and nice to look at

They've divided it into sections: On one side, there are (left to right) red carpet dresses, Big Little Lies outfits, Legally Blonde clothes, and Legally Blonde accessories

'She can walk in and see all the parts of her life, all on display,' says Joanna

Sequel: She has a lot of pieces from Legally Blonde 2, including the pillbox hat she wore

Famous! Several of the items are instantly recognizable

On tour: The hat and the rest of the pink outfit have been in museums before landing in Reese's house

She also has quite a few outfits from Big Little Lies.

Especially exciting are all the pieces she still has from making Legally Blonde, including the pink ensemble on the poster for the sequel, which has been in several museums before landing back in Reese's home. She also a robe Elle wore.

When Reese leaves, the pair gets to work. They and their four employees begin by putting on gloves because they are handling 'priceless items.'

'Our house goals for Reese's memorabilia closet are to divide the closet into sections relating to her various wardrobe from movies, TV shows, her red carpet moments,' Clea explains.

'Then she can walk in and see all the parts of her life, all on display,' adds Joanna.

They admit that the project is a bit different from what they usually do, since everything is about displaying items rather than making them easier to find or use.

In charge: She appears to have been more likely to keep items from projects produced by her production company, Hello Sunshine (pictured: Big Little Lies pieces)

Custom: The sections have custom labels printed with a font made from Clea's handwriting

Don't forget! Her red carpet dresses have labels with the year and event

'I am always nervous. I go into every project nervous, that is my baseline emotion for everything. I am a little bit optimistic because I think we have a really great blank canvas to work with,' says Clea.

'It's like making a little mini Reese museum,' she adds.  

While in some homes, they might toss out unnecessary things, there is obviously nothing be trashed here. 

'The only editing we would do in this project is if we were to steal the rubber ducky bathrobe, which we're not gonna do because we're not criminals,' Clea jokes.

When the group has finished, Reese returns — and is clearly thrilled with the results, stopping to take it all in.

Clea and Joanna show how they've divided the closets into sections, with one large area dedicated Legally Blonde. There, outfits from the movies are hanging, and hats and other accessories are on display and in clear containers on shelves. 

Keepsakes: On the opposite side is a section of blue boxes with other items Reese has collected, including one dedicated to Walk the Line

Mementos: They include items that didn't belong on the shelves, like pieces of paper

Not made for walkin'! The shoes are all perfectly on display

Pricey: While many of the shoes in the closet likely costs hundreds of dollars each, by now they are priceless

Designer goodies: Quite a few have visible Jimmy Choo labels

In love! Reese is clearly thrilled with the results, and says: 'The closet is so gorgeous'

A stuffed toy version of the dog Bruiser is hanging in a purse.

There's also a section for Big Little Lies, and one for Reese's award show gowns, with labels showing where she wore them. 

On the opposite side is a section of blue boxes with other items Reese has collected, including one dedicated to Walk the Line.

Her shoes are also perfectly on display on the shelves. 

'The closet is so gorgeous. They organized everything, just perfectly, all the labels and all the little drawers that hold every accessory that Elle Woods had! It's a memorabilia paradise,' says Reese.

The trio joke that that The Home Edit will have to come back once Reese has some more movie and TV items to add in. 

Check it out! Khloe Karadashian gave fans an up-close look inside her garage in her episode in the new season

Cleanup! She uses her garage to house lots of stuff but wanted everything organized a bit better

Before: Khloe's garage wasn't exactly a mess before, but it had a 'mish-mosh' of items all over the place

Toys: True's collection of luxury cars was mixed in with strollers and a clump on one side

Needs a bit of work: She also had some loose cleaning supplies out near her painting area

In another episode this season, Khloe Karadashian had Clea and Joanna come organize her garage. 



'It's the most exciting house that could possibly exist for us. It's like organizing a museum anyway,' Clea says in a planning session before the visit.

The pair has 'already worked [their] way through most of the house' — and reworked their way through it again — but they'd never touched the garage before, and they were thrilled.

'Not to play favorites, but she is one of our favorite people ever,' says Clea. 'She understands us, she gets organization. To be honest, she could really just do it all herself.'

The warm feelings are clearly mutual, and Khloe welcomes them to her home with a huge smile.



'I'm always excited to see you. I think it just gets better and better,' she tells them.

'The way I feel when Joanna and Clea come to my house, any time they come, it's just a sense of relief,' she adds to the camera. 

'I know that something is gonna get done the way that I would do it myself.  

'I'm always excited to see you. I think it just gets better and better,' Khloe tells them

Ready to go! The women quickly get to work, pulling everything out to put it back in with a better system

Good American: Everything went into clear boxes which got custom labels

Speedy: The organizing pair managed to do the whole thing in just one day

Swag: Khloe has a lot of extra merch from her and her family's product lines

Drive-in: There also needed to be a better system for True's cars

'The way I feel when Joanna and Clea come to my house, any time they come, it's just a sense of relief,' Khloe says

'I'm so particular and I'm very OCD in certain ways, and they don't judge me for that.'

Though she's 'absolutely crazy' about organizing, she admits to the women that she doesn't pay much attention to her garage, and it's organized 'in the worst way possible' with 'a mish-mosh of stuff.' 

Still, when the three women walk into the garage, they reveal an are that's not actually that messy. Clear bins hold some things in storage, True's ride-in toy cars are all lined up, and a designated painting area with easels sits in the middle.

Khloe explains that she started painting while pregnant and realized she liked it for therapeutic reasons — and is actually 'kind of good at it.'

There are a few random things thrown in, though, like extra high-chairs for visiting nieces and nephews and a bike that Khloe admits she doesn't know how to ride.

Plus, inside her house she has a closet full of merch from her various product launches — which she keeps in case she needs to give some to people — and she wants to move all of that to the garage. 

 Khloe said: 'I know that something is gonna get done the way that I would do it myself. I'm so particular and I'm very OCD in certain ways, and they don't judge me for that'

Amazing! She was thrilled by how immaculate the garage looked when the women were done

Khloe comes back to see what they've done, exclaiming, 'Oh my god!'

A spot for everything: There is a parking lot for True's cars, with spaces made using pink tape

The view: Khloe's art station has been turned around so she can look outside while she paints

Nice! Khloe explains that she started painting while pregnant and realized she liked it for therapeutic reasons — and is actually 'kind of good at it'

Smart! They put her supplies on a cart that can be easily wheeled around

Khloe leaves them to it for several hours, and the women get organizing with a professional team.

At the end of the day, Khloe comes back to see what they've done, exclaiming, 'Oh my god!'

The right wall is now lined with identical black shelving units outfitted with clear containers — all of which are meticulously labeled with white letters.

Here, Khloe now has all of her merch overflow, including Good American jeans, makeup from her collaboration with Kylie cosmetics, and pieces from her sibligns' brands. 

On the floor on the right side of the garage, True's luxury cars are perfectly lined up in a mini parking lot, with designated spots created with light pink tape. The strollers that had previously been crammed in with them now have their own separate spot.

'I don't know why I never thought of this!' says Khloe. 'It's so excellent!' 

More shelving units on the back wall hold Khloe's gift section, including spare baby shoes, books, fragrances, and blankets.  

Shelving: Behind the cars are shelves holding all of the merchandise in clear bins

Want! Khloe has lots of stuff from Good American and Kylie Cosmetics to give away 

'Joanna and Clea, they made a beautiful, functional space,' Khloe says

Easy! There is also a section with extra gifts that Khloe keeps in storage should she ever need a present for someone

Variety: She has some baby items like bows and shows, plus adult gifts like perfume

'Most of my house is pretty organized right now but I might mess some things up just to get them back,' Khloe says

Further along, more shelves hold extra household items in storage, including tissues, soap, diapers, wipes, disinfectant, and cleaners. 

Khloe's art station remains in the middle, but the easels have been flipped so Khloe can look outside while she paints. They've also added a cart for her art supplies. 

'Joanna and Clea, they made a beautiful, functional space,' Khloe says. 'I know where everything is but it's also visually appealing and everything is spaced out perfectly so I can find everything so perfectly. It's just perfect.  

'I don't know how they did all that in just a few hours. They're like little wizards. They just do it.

'Most of my house is pretty organized right now but I might mess some things up just to get them back,' she adds.

'I should marry them. What am I waiting on?'

The Home Edit has grown in popularity on Instagram over the past few years, thanks to the droolworthy photos they post pantries and closets that have been perfect organized, with items divided into identical clear bins and cascading with color. 

Several of their famous clients, including Gwyneth Paltrow, have also shared the results of their work. 

'One of the things we love most about having organized homes, and one of the things we often hear from our clients, is how calm they feel when everything’s put away. Organization can help save time, money, and ultimately, your sanity,' Joanna told Create & Cultivate.  

Other well-known customers include Mandy Moore, Abigail Spencer, Whitney Port, Olivia Culpo, Hoda Kotb, Kasey Musgraves, Jessie James Decker, Schitt's Creek star Dan Levy, Vanessa Lachey, and Tiffani Thiessen.

'My kitchen and pantry looked insane and the lovely ladies at @thehomeedit came and changed my life (I mean, at least my snacks),' she wrote on Instagram.
