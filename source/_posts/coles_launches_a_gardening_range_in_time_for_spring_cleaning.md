'Customers are constantly telling us how much they are loving the best buy ranges and amazing value each fortnight,' Coles general manager for health and home Jonathan Torr said.

'Our team has worked hard to ensure we are offering the best value possible on products as well as expanding the range to more stores so more people can access the savings the range has to offer.'
