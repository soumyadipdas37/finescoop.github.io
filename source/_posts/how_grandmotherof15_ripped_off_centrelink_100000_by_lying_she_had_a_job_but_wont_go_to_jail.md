A grandmother who ripped off the taxpayer to the tune of $108,816 after fraudulently claiming Centrelink benefits has escaped a prison sentence.

Mary Irvine failed to report her job as a personal aged care worker in Victoria to the government agency on two occasions over a five year period. 

The 56-year-old was claiming the disability support pension due to her severe asthma while making more than $1,000 a fortnight working at Yallambee Traralgon Village from 2014 to 2018.

Mary Irvine (pictured) pleaded guilty to dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception

She also failed to report her income while working in Gippsland for ten months in 2012.

Irvine pleaded guilty to two charges of dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception via video link in County Court of Victoria on Tuesday.

The court heard Irvine thought her granddaughter had been correctly lodging her Centrelink income reporting form for her, which Judge Carolene Gwynn did not accept.

'(Recipients are) not eligible for DSP payments if they work more than 30 hours per week,' Judge Gwynn said, as reported by NCA NewsWire. 

Irvine had previously told police her ex-husband spent her allowance on alcohol, though her bank statements revealed she had spent large sums of the cash at Big W, Target and Bunnings.

Judge Gwynn sentenced Irvine to a three-year good behaviour bond and two year suspended jail sentence.

The 56-year-old claimed $108,816 after defrauding Centrelink on two occasions over five years

'(Your) motivation was more need-based than one of sheer greed, yet that does not excuse your offending,' she said

She said there was 'a place for both mercy and leniency' in Irvine's trial.

Irvine must also repay Centrelink the money.
