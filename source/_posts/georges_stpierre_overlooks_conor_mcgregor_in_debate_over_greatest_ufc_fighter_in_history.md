Georges St-Pierre does not consider Conor McGregor among the greatest MMA fighters of all time. 

The Canadian, who is regularly chosen by fans as their pick as the best to have competed in the sport, overlooked the now retired former two-weight champion. 

He believes Royce Gracie to be the most influential and explained to TMZ: 'Royce Gracie is the one that really changed the sport.

Georges St-Pierre does not consider Conor McGregor among the greatest of all time 

'[He] changed the entire belief system of what a real fight is.'

The Brazilian is in the UFC Hall of Fame and was one of the company's earliest stars, popularising the style of jiu-jitsu his family have exported worldwide as an elite fighting discipline. 

GSP then added: 'Jon Jones is there, Jon Jones I believe right now is the best guy. There's also Khabib that could be there, there's a lot of guys.

'But we should never forget about the guys who were there before us.

'They paved the way for us.'

The Irishman thinks he is either No 1 or second behind Anderson Silva as the greatest

GSP thinks Gracie changed the way most people perceived what fighting can be 

Jones and Khabib are ranked first and second respectively in the UFC's current pound-for-pound list. 

Jones has lost only once, from a disqualification, while Khabib remains undefeated inside the octagon. 

Earlier this year McGregor offered his verdict on the best of all time, ranking Anderson Silva as No 1, himself No 2 and GSP in third.   

McGregor announced his third retirement earlier this summer having made his comeback in a win over Donald Cerrone in January.

The Irishman was recently accused of showing off his manhood and then assaulting a young married woman in a bar toilet following a heavy drinking session in the Port of Calvi, on the French island of Corsica on September 6. 

French police raided McGregor's £3million yacht and took the UFC star away after claims he 'exhibited his private parts' to the alleged victim as she entered a bar toilet. 

McGregor has strongly denied the recent allegations, and Emmanuelle Ramon, his lawyer, said his client 'vigorously denied any wrongdoing'.
