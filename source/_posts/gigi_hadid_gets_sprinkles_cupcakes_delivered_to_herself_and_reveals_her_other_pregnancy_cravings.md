A month before welcoming her first child, IMG Model Gigi Hadid decided to reveal some of what she's been craving during her hush-hush pregnancy.

'Pregnancy is real when u order nationally shipped @sprinkles to be delivered to yourself,' the expecting 25-year-old - who boasts 67M social media followers - tweeted on Sunday.

'@sprinkles do I have to defrost the whole box right when I get it or can I defrost the [cupcakes] one by one to make them last longer?'  

Eating for two! A month before welcoming her first child, IMG Model Gigi Hadid decided to reveal some of what she's been craving during her hush-hush pregnancy (pictured July 26)

The New York baking brand unveiled their national shipping service in July, and customers must wait 'one to two hours' before the cupcakes thaw from their 'unique commercial flash freezing process to lock in freshness.'

Aside from cupcakes and her daily bagel, Gigi (born Jelena) also told fans she's been indulging in 'supreme triple chunk brownies' and 'make-your-own ranch mix dip [with] carrots.'

Hadid - who 'dreams' about In-N-Out Burgers - is said to be 34 weeks along with a daughter with former 1D boybander, Zayn Malik.

On Sunday, the 27-year-old singer was celebrating Washington, D.C. pop trio Shaed winning the best remix trophy for their track Trampoline (featuring Zayn) at the virtual iHeartRadio Music Awards.

Fast food fix: Hadid - who 'dreams' about In-N-Out Burgers - is said to be 34 weeks along with a daughter with former 1D boybander, Zayn Malik

The half-Jordanian, half-Dutch American and the half-Pakistani Englishman were last pictured together driving to their $5.8M three-bedroom apartment in Manhattan's NoHo neighborhood on August 19.

'They both are reading parenting books, having had fun planning the nursery and picking out items together,' an insider told E! News on August 25.

'Zayn and Gigi are really excited and have been loving this experience together. Things are going really smoothly and they are closer as a couple more than ever.'

The nesting parents-to-be famously met in late 2015 and split in November 2018 before rekindling their on/off romance in December.
