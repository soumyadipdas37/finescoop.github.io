The Bachelor's Bella Varelis, 25, and Irena Srbinovska, 31, are set for a fiery confrontation as the ladies head back to the mansion on Thursday. 

In the latest teaser for the series, the two frontrunners clash in a bitter argument seemingly over their feelings for Locky Gilbert.   

'Irena, I don't trust you anymore, I'm sorry,' Bella tells the clearly agitated nurse, who says she also also no longer 'trusts' Bella.

'Great. Friendship done. I'm over your bullsh*t to be honest. You're a manipulative little bi*ch,' Bella tells her, as she does a walk off. 

Bella's animosity towards nurse Irena is on full display as she confesses the nurse 'grinds my gears' after seeing her at the cocktail party. 

'I'm not stoked to see her,' Bella says. 

Irena seems perplexed by the sudden acrimonious behaviour, with the two women previously friends in the mansion. 

Upset: 'Great. Friendship done. I'm over your bullsh*t to be honest. You're a manipulative little bi*ch,' Bella tells Irena, prompting her to walk off set 

Turmoil: 'I'm not stoked to see her,' Bella says, clearly annoyed at the nurse. Bella looks to be avoiding her until the two women have a verbal stoush 

'Bella decided that our friendship was done,' Irena says, with her then shown saying: 'It's hurt me so bad.' 

It isn't just Bella and Irena who go head-to-head, with Roxi Kenny and Juliette Herrera also coming to verbal blows. 

'I would rather gouge my eye out with a spoon than see Juliette tonight,' Roxi says in a piece-to-camera. 

Anger: 'Honestly, what is this bi*ch doing?' Roxi complains as Juliette (pictured) swans over. 'We agreed, stay away from me. Respect that'

'Honestly, what is this bi*ch doing?' Roxi complains as Juliette swans over. 'We agreed, stay away from me. Respect that.' 

Juliette is then heard saying: 'Nothing's changed. Roxi's having a meltdown.'

Roxi later tells the cameraman to get out of her face.
