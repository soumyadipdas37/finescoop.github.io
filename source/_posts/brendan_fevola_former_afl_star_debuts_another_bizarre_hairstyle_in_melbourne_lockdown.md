Brendan Fevola is doing his best to keep himself amused through Melbourne's second lockdown. 

During the first coronavirus lockdown, the 39-year-old AFL star experimented with several bizarre hairstyles, and on Thursday he was at it again, debuting yet another crazy 'do. 

This time the FOX FM radio star rocked a half-shaved mullet. 

What has happened to Brendan Fevola? Former AFL star debuted another bizarre hairstyle on Thursday as Melbourne's hard lockdown continues 

Brendan had shorn the front half of his head completely bald, and left his long dark curly locks at the back. 

He hilariously captioned the snap: 'Looking grouse 2020'.

It comes after Brendan unveiled several dramatic looks back in April. 

The sports star dyed his hair green and purple to represent his employer's trademark logo.

'New day, new hair style,' he wrote, before offering a spirited plug for his show with co-stars Fifi Box and Byron Cooke. 

'Make sure you are tuning in 6 till 10 Mon to Fri,' he said, adding fans could also download the smart phone app. 

Brendan also informed his legion of fans his daughter Leni did the dye job.

The shock look came after the AFL player, who is normally a brunette, admitted he 'got bored' while cooped up at home and decided to change his hair colour.

After his hair initially went yellow, Brendan later unveiled the lighter blond colour after a second dye attempt to his Instagram fans,

'I'm so not posing here,' he cheekily wrote underneath the new post with his peroxide blonde hair.

The former Carlton footy star then joked 'just a candid shot of my grouse look', alongside the hashtags 'new hair' and 'blonds have more fun'. 

Brendan claimed he was channeling Eminem's Slim Shady look with his newly bleached hair and said: 'ISO got me doing weird s**t'. 

Last month, the proud father-of-three revealed that he has found a novel way to keep his daughters Leni, Lulu and baby Tobi busy and well-behaved while homeschooling.

The media personality shared an Instagram photo showing a list of a chores and a bunch of snacks.

The payment for these tasks was generous - $20 for cleaning their room, $50 for exercise and $20 for thirty minutes of reading. 

In exchange for the payment, the girls could buy chocolates, chips and others snacks from the nearby shelf. 

Wow! The 39-year-old shared an Instagram photo, showing a list of chores and a bunch of snacks. Chores could be exchanged for Monopoly money, which can then be used to buy treats from the special shelf 

But the prices were steep - $50 for popcorn, $25 for a snack sized bag of chips and a whopping $100 for ice cream.  

The twist: the payments were not made in cash but Monopoly money, making the whole task a fun game. 

Brendan captioned the photo:  'Best parent advice I've seen so far. Trying this with my kids see how we all go have a crack'.
