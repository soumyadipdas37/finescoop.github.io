Leggy: Alessandra Ambrosio Turned heads in Daisy Dukes while out on an errand run in Beverly Hills and Brentwood on Thursday

Ambrosio, 39, was spotted walking into at a local passport photo business not too far from from her home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

For the clip, she had a cartoon finger added in to point at herself and her #Together mask.
