In Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President, which explores the 39th president special connection with the music community, Carter shared that one of his sons got high with the country star.

'And he says that his companion that shared the pot with him was one of the servants at the White House. That is not exactly true. It actually was one of my sons.' 

Carter made it a point not to reveal which of his three sons was the one who enjoyed a quick puff with the country music legend. 

It is a brief, humorous moment in a documentary that follows Carters impressive talent for using music and artists to help get him into and stay at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Chip Carter has vaguely confirmed that he was the son that enjoyed some pot with Nelson during a brief set break in 1980

When asked whether he was the son of the peanut farmer who enjoyed a little bit of pot with Nelson, Chip Carter paused before answering. While he has confirmed the bit in the past, he usually answers in vague terms, the Los Angeles Times reports.  

'My guess is it's true. If you're talking about me and Willie, he was my friend,' he said. 'I've never talked about that before.' 

It just so happens to be the 40th anniversary of the passing of the joint, this Sunday. 

On September 13, 1980, Carter had been in the heat of his reelection campaign against Ronald Reagan when Nelson had stopped by for a set at the White House

On September 13, 1980, Carter had been in the heat of his reelection campaign against Ronald Reagan when Nelson had stopped by for a set at the White House. 

At the time, 52 American hostages had been held in more than a year of captivity.   

'In the break I said, "Let's go upstairs." We just kept going up till we got to the roof, where we leaned against the flagpole at the top of the place and lit one up.'

 'If you know Washington, the White House is the hub of the spokes — the way it was designed. Most of the avenues run into the White House. You could sit up and could see all the traffic coming right at you. It's a nice place up there.'

The documentary comes out in theaters this week.
