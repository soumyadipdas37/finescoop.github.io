If your bedside table is constantly cluttered with books, tablets, chargers and other bits and pieces, then you might be interested to learn of this space-saving hack. 

The SIMBOOM Bedside Storage Bag neatly fits underneath your mattress, providing you with extra space to help get your bedside table into tip-top shape.  

Not only genius for small spaces like university dorms, but it's also been a revelation for hundreds of Amazon shoppers who are obsessed over its ability to make light work of desk organisation. Even better, you can now snap up the bedside pocket storage for just £6.79.

The SIMBOOM Bedside Storage Bag is an Amazon bestseller and a real space-saving hack 

Aside from costing as little as £6.79 on Amazon, the SIMBOOM Bedside Storage Bag has racked up nearly 1,000 glowing ratings.

Shoppers have called the storage bag 'great for organising chaos', 'very spacious, stylish, and subtle' and even 'one of the most useful things I've bought'.

'One of the most useful things I've bought. Wish I'd come across this years ago! My bedside table used to cluttered with phone, Kindle, iPad, tv remote and lots of other bits and pieces. This stores them all, and they're all close to hand. One of the best buys I've made.' 

Another shopper raved: 'It will change your life, especially if you wear glasses and read books. Never realized how useful it could be to have a bed pocket until I purchased one. It looks nice, the room is tidy, and I can finally easily find my glasses in the morning!! Great product.' 

A third shopper added: 'I've purchased several of these now to give as presents. Every person that's received them has said how great it is, easy to fit, and holds items like iPads, phones, earplugs, books etc. with ease - basically all the clutter that would otherwise be on the bedside table.'

The SIMBOOM Bedside Storage Bag has been designed to easily slot between the mattress and box spring or couch cushions so is a good choice for the bedroom and living room.

There are 12 styles available, varying in colour and sizes including a Sofa Couch Armrest Organiser and Bedside Storage Bag

The hanging storage caddy has plenty of pockets for extra storage space. Great for sorting bedside clutter, it keeps things neat and tidy whilst keeping your essentials close to hand.

Shoppers have found plenty of uses for the SIMBOOM Sofa Organizer too. If you're fed up with losing the remote or like charging your phone whilst watching TV, the caddy will keep everything at your fingertips.

'I bought this to organise all our remote controls. The quality was much better than I had expected, nice and thick felt. Slots onto the side of our couch nicely. Delivered quickly. I would recommend this.' 

One shopper even suggested using it as a desk organiser when working from home, writing: 'This is much better than expected. Working from home now and trying to find space-saving options to replace a file holder in the office. I use it for A4 size papers, light files and a diary pad, it also takes my specs case, pens, post-its etc.

There are lots of little pockets in it, so it helps for organising and helps keep all that stuff off the home desk, which is much smaller than the office desk.'
