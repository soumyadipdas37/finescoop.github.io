In a product debut that will surprise no one, Yandy has unveiled a pair of 'sexy' Tiger King-themed Halloween costumes this year.

The e-retailer — which has sold sexy costumes inspired by the Popeyes chicken sandwich, Mr. Rogers, and Rihanna and Beyonce's Met Gala outfits in the past — has just launched the 'Coolest Cat' and 'Tiger Queen' costumes online.

While there's no Carole Baskin-inspired version, the two costumes on offer give friends the opportunity to reimagine themselves as a female Joe Exotic and one of his exotic cats — both in skimpy attire.

'Meow, sassy zookeeper!' reads the description. 'Aren't you an exotic, tiger-befriending beauty? Ignore that bizarre babe throwing serious cat-itude your way. Prove you're the star of the animal breeding world in this exclusive Tiger Queen costume,

Meanwhile, the $49.90 Coolest Cat costume is its perfect companion, packaged with a tiger print bodysuit and a matching tiger ears headband.

'A queen only bows down to her king. Be the baddest kitty queen in town in this Coolest Cat costume,' the description reads.

Get ready: PETA, the animal rights organization, debuted a 'Joe Exotic Tiger Killer Costume' for a whopping $159.99 earlier this year

While these certainly seem to be the first 'sexy' Tiger King costumes, they're not actually the first Halloween getups inspired by the show.

In May, nearly six months ahead of the holiday, the animal rights organization PETA debuted a 'Joe Exotic Tiger Killer Costume' for a whopping $159.99.

The costume, which is available for pre-order and will ship by September 30, includes an orange prison jumpsuit, a blonde wig, and a fuzzy stuffed tiger.

PETA is clearly no fan of Joe's, and rushed to get the costume ready ahead of dedicated Halloween retailers.

In the item's description, the organization takes issue with the light, amused way that some viewers have watched the documentary, stressing that Joe — real name Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage — has been found guilty of crimes.

'Netflix's docuseries Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness glossed over Joe Exotic's cruelty to animals, but PETA's spoof Halloween costume makes clear that "Mr. Mullet" belongs behind bars, where he can no longer harm a tuft of fur on any animal's head,' reads the site.

'We hope everyone will be out and about by Halloween, so this one-of-a-kind costume is available for preorder now,' it goes on.  

Not a fan: PETA says: '"Mr. Mullet" belongs behind bars, where he can no longer harm a tuft of fur on any animal's head' 

'It comes with everything you need to portray the notorious tiger abuser: a blond wig, a mustache, jail bars, a plush pouncing tiger, and an orange jumpsuit with the more apt moniker "Tiger Killer" on the front.'

PETA suggests washing the polyester-cotton blend costume with cruelty-free detergent.

A spokesperson further slammed Joe in s statement to Orlando Weekly.

'Tiger King has exposed tiger exhibitors as ghouls who steal cubs from their mothers, exploit them as living photo props, and then often discard or kill them when they grow up,' PETA Foundation director of captive animal law enforcement Brittany Peet said.

'This Halloween, PETA will poke some pointed fun at a tiger killer who belongs behind bars, where he can no longer harm a hair on any animal's head.'

Earlier this year, Joe was was sentenced to 22 years in prison for a murder-for-hire plot against Carole Baskin, killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs, and falsifying wildlife records.

Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage, 56, is also known by the nickname 'Joe Exotic,' and is the subject of Netflix's new documentary Tiger King. 

He once was the owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma.

He was known for his colorful personality, and in 2016 he ran as a write-in candidate for president, even appearing on John Oliver's Last Week Tonight to promote himself.

They do: Joe had a three-way wedding with Travis Moldonado and John Finlay in 2014; he was married to five men total

In 2017, he ran as a Libertarian candidate for Oklahoma governor.

Joe had been married four times in all, to a total of five men.

His longest marriage was to Brian Rhyne from 1986 to 2001, followed by his union with J. C. Hartpence.

He then had a three-way wedding with Travis Moldonado and John Finlay in 2014, but in 2017, a then 23-year-old Moldonado died after authorities say he accidentally fatally shot himself in the head.

His final marriage was to Dillon Passage in December 2017, and they were together when Joe was arrest in 2018. 

Guilty: In January of this year, he was sentenced to 22 years in prison for a murder-for-hire plot

In April of 2019, Joe was found guilty of a murder-for-hire plot targeting the CEO of Big Cat Rescue, Carole Baskin. 

The jury heard evidence that he paid a man $3,000 to travel to Florida to kill Baskin, with a promise to pay more after she was dead. He was upset that Baskin, an outspoken critic of his, had won a million-dollar civil judgment against him.

After his initial attempt failed, he offered $10,000 to an undercover FBI agent to kill Baskin during a meeting that was recorded and played for the jury. In the recording, he told the agent: 'Just like follow her into a mall parking lot and just cap her and drive off.' 

Joe was also convicted for killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs, and falsifying wildlife records. 

In January of this year, he was sentenced to 22 years in prison. 

After the sentence, he released a statement via Facebook saying he planned to appeal.

He said: 'I still maintain my innocence and looking forward in the upcoming days to my attorneys filing my appeal and moving onto the next step in this nightmare.'
