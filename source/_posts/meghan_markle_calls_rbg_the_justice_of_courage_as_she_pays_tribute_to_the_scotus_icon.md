Meghan Markle has paid tribute to late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, calling her 'a Justice of courage'.

'With an incomparable and indelible legacy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg will forever be known as a woman of brilliance, a Justice of courage, and a human of deep conviction,' Markle said in a statement to the media.

'She has been a true inspiration to me since I was a girl. Honor her, remember her, act for her,' she continued.

Markle, 39, is currently living in Los Angeles with Prince Harry and their son Archie, after the couple stepped down as senior royals in March and moved to North America.

'With an incomparable and indelible legacy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg will forever be known as a woman of brilliance, a Justice of courage, and a human of deep conviction,' Markle said

Ginsburg, the second female justice ever appointed to the Supreme Court, is widely regarded as a feminist icon.

Prior to her appointment to the high court, Ginsburg argued six gender equality cases before the court.

Markle was just one of the many voices raised up to pay tribute to the late justice.

Democratic Party vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, joined crowds outside the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington on Saturday morning.Â 

Ginsburg was 'a titan - a relentless defender of justice and a legal mind for the ages,' Harris wrote in a tweet with a photo of the visit.



Others on the Supreme Court steps clutched candles, flowers, signs, and young children. Some appeared in running and biking clothes, on a detour from their morning exercising.

Ginsburg, 87, died on Friday night after a battle with pancreatic cancer, giving President Donald Trump a chance to expand the U.S. top court's conservative majority at a time of deep divisions in America, as a presidential election looms.

Mourners heralded Ginsburg's groundbreaking legal career and expressed dark worries about the future of the country.

'I am heartbroken,' actor Jennifer Lopez wrote on Instagram. 'She was a true champion of gender equality and was a strong woman for me and all the little girls of the world to look up to.'
