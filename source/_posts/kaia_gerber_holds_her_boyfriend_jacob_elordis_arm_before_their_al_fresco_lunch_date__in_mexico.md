Kaia Gerber intimately held her new boyfriend Jacob Elordi's arm while headed inside a Cabo San Lucas restaurant during their Mexican vacation with her famous folks Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber.

The 19-year-old Malibu native was wearing nothing more than a black string bikini, patterned maxi-skirt, and sandals while the Australian 23-year-old sported a striped T-shirt and swim trunks.

For their al fresco lunch date, Kaia and Jacob did not protect themselves or others from the coronavirus by wearing a CDC-recommended mask or face covering.

As of Wednesday, there have reportedly been over 710K confirmed COVID-19 cases in Mexico, which has lead to 74K deaths in the country.

Gerber and Elordi 'have been inseparable' ever since they were first pictured together at Nobu Malibu on September 1.

'They've been going out to dinner at night and working out together at the gym during the day,' a source told E! News.

'They're always laughing and smiling at each other and they seem very happy to be together.'

Before the 6ft5in heartthrob, the DNA Model packed on the PDA with her 'sole-mate' Cara Delevingne at a Black Lives Matter rally held outside the Hall Of Justice on July 16.

Jacob is Kaia's first public romance since ending her two-month fling with SNL star Pete Davidson back in December.

Meanwhile, Elordi was previously linked to his Kissing Booth castmate Joey King from 2017-2018 and his Euphoria co-star Zendaya from February through April.

HBO halted production on the second season of their critically-acclaimed drug and sex-fueled teen drama after the March 11 script reading due to COVID.

'In order to do it the way we want to do it, we need to wait until it’s safer,' the 24-year-old Emmy winner told InStyle last month.

'There is an idea to do a couple of bridge episodes that can be shot safely but aren't necessarily part of season two. So, hopefully, we will be able to do those in the coming months. I can't wait!'

In Euphoria, Jacob plays antagonistic East Highland High School quarterback Nate Jacobs, 'whose anger issues mask his sexual insecurities.'

As for Gerber, she and her 54-year-old mother teamed up last Thursday to model in a new Omega Watch campaign shot in their garage by famed lensman Norman Jean Roy.
