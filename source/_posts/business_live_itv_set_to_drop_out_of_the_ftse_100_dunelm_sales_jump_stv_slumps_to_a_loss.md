Broadcaster ITV  is set to be relegated from the FTSE 100 in today's reshuffle after its shares suffered from the drop in advertising spend since the pandemic took hold.  Value retailer B&M is tipped to take its place in the corporate top flight. 

Elsewhere, homeware seller Dunelm has reported a jump in sales, helped by pent-up demand following store closures and its summer sale.
