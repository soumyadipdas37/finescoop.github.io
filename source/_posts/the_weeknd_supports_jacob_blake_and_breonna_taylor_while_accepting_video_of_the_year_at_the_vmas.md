The Weeknd called for justice for prominent Black victims of police violence on Sunday at the MTV Video Music Awards.

The 30-year-old singer took to the stage twice during the evening to accept awards, including the prestigious Video of the Year moonperson for Blinding Lights.

He kept his acceptance speeches to a minimum while calling for 'justice' for Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor. 

Justice: The Weeknd, 30, called for 'justice' for Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor on Sunday while accepting two awards at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards

'Thank you, VMAs and MTV,' he began during his first win of the evening for Best R&B for Blinding Lights.'I want to thank Lamar Taylor and Anton Tammi for the video.'

He continued the short speech by mentioning two Black people injured or killed by police in the past year.  

'It's hard for me to celebrate right now and enjoy this moment. So I'm just going to say justice for Jacob Blake and justice for Breonna Taylor. Thank you.'

When the Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye)came on stage toward the end of the distanced ceremony he repeated his speech almost word for word and with a similar cadence, raising the possibility that the pre-taped speeches were recorded back-to-back. 

Short and sweet: 'It's hard for me to celebrate right now and enjoy this moment,' he said. 'So I'm just going to say justice for Jacob Blake and justice for Breonna Taylor. Thank you'

The Can't Feel My Face singer was made-up to look as if he'd been beaten up, and his face was coated with blood smears and fake lacerations. 

In the winning video for Blinding Lights, he's seen being being beat up by club bouncers. 

The look was all the more disturbing when paired with an invocation of Black people who had been gunned down by police.

Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by police officers while he was outside of an apartment building in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 23.

Though he survived his injuries, Blake is currently paralyzed and was initially shackled to his bed by police, though he was later freed of his restraints.

Counterprotest: A group of Blue Lives Matter protesters supported police officers in counter protests on Sunday. On Tuesday, 17-year-old Blue Lives Matter supporter Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two protestors and injured a third

It was later reported that he had been tased twice by officers, and the allegation that he had a knife in his car at the time was selectively released later by police.

The shooting kicked off days of ongoing unrest in Kenosha and around the country.

On Tuesday, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse drove from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, where he was accused of shooting and killing to protestors with an assault rifle, as well as injuring a third.

Since then, he has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide.

Gunned down: Breonna Taylor, a Black EMT, was shot eight times by police in her Louisville, Kentucky, home after the executed an illegal no-knock warrant; Taylor pictured on the left

Taylor was shot and killed in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, by police on March 13.

The police were searching for a suspect who didn't even live with Taylor and who was already in police custody at the time of the raid that killed her.

Though her death didn't initially inspire protests, the uprising following the police killing of George Floyd created renewed interest in her killing.

Seeing red: The Weeknd was dressed in a scarlet blazer with peak over a black shirt and matching tie and black trousers

On theme: The look, including the injury makeup, was part of his character for his album After Hours, and he's worn the look during multiple appearances and performances

The Weeknd was dressed in a scarlet blazer with peak over a black shirt and matching tie and black trousers.

He finished the ensemble with black and white loafers and wore thick black leather gloves.

The look, including the injury makeup, was part of his character for his album After Hours, and he's worn the look during multiple appearances and performances, including when he performed the song on Saturday Night Live in March.
