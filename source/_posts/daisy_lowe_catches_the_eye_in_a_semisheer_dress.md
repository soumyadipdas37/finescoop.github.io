London's Ned provided the setting as Daisy Lowe attended her first public engagement with new boyfriend Jordan Saul on Sunday. 

The British model was in high spirits while cuddling up to property developing hunk Jordan as they made an appearance at the Ned's Club X Malfy Gin partnership. 

Sporting a black dress with semi-sheer detailing, Daisy, 31, caught the eye during a brief photo-call before mingling with guests including Love Island presenter Laura Whitmore and Made In Chelsea's Tabitha Willett.

The brunette added to her look with a smart leather jacket, while a simple black clutch and gold pendent necklace proved to be her only visible accessories. 

Adding a splash of vibrancy to an otherwise subdued colour scheme, Daisy rounded off her make-up with a generous layer of rich, red lipstick.

Joining his new girlfriend, Jordan - the latest in a long line of men to be connected with Daisy over the course of the year - looked relaxed in a loose fitting shirt and ripped jeans.

The new couple were attending the event little more than a week after going public with their romance during a post-lockdown trip to Portugal. 

They were first pictured together on a boozy day out in a north London park in mid-July and then went on a date to the zoo together.

Jordan is understood to work as a new home consultant for an estate agent.

Make way: Stylist Emma Thatcher (L) looked lovely in a breezy tiered floral dress, while model Grace McGovern (R) opted for understated high-slung cargo trousers and baseball boots

Don't mind me: But Love Island star Laura was hard to miss as she made her way into the event on Sunday afternoon 

Daisy, daughter of Bush rocker Gavin Rossdale and Pearl Lowe, seemed enamoured with Jordan, just a month after she was linked to musician Christian Langdon.

Christian is also the ex-husband of Cat Pierce from The Pierces. The rocker was a member of Arckid in the 1990s and early 2000s.

He also goes by the nickname 'Leggy Langdon', thanks to his statuesque frame.

Daisy's spokesperson previously told MailOnline that her relationship with Christian was platonic after she was spotted with a ring on her engagement finger.

Before that, Daisy had been dating singer Jack Peñate, 35, for six months, but they split in March, with Daisy saying she 'couldn't see a future' with him

The beauty had found romance with Jack after splitting from Cameron McMeikan, 24.

Daisy and Cameron dated for almost a year before reportedly ending their romance over their six-year age gap.
