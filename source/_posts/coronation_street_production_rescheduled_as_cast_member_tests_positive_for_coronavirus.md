Coronation Street bosses were forced to reschedule production after a member of the cast tested positive for Covid-19 after being on set last week.

The long-running soap had to briefly shut down certain areas of the set for a deep clean, after the coronavirus positive actor had filmed scenes.

It has been reported that although certain areas were closed down it did not affect filming due to the soap's two-metre distancing rules, according to The Guardian.

A spokeswoman for ITV soap told MailOnline: 'We can confirm a member of the Coronation Street team has tested positive for coronavirus. The protocols we have in place for such an eventuality have been implemented and the individual is now self isolating at home.

'Although we do not believe anyone has been within 2m of the individual, as a precaution, the production team who were working with the individual have been notified.

'In keeping with health and safety guidance, we have also undertaken an intensive clean of touch points in the cohort area where the individual was working and areas of the building they visited.

The representative for the soap also confirmed filmed continued on Monday after the situation was contained following an extensive clean in the targeted area. 

MailOnline understands that filming was slightly rescheduled this week due to the actors absence on set as they isolate at home. 

It was reported by the Guardian that the soap is assured that no longer member of the crew or cast came into close contact with the actor.

They also said that everyone who worked with them had been notified.

Worried: Coronation Street and Emmerdale bosses are reportedly concerned their soaps will look dated compared to BBC rival EastEnders

The news comes amid claims Coronation Street and Emmerdale bosses are reportedly concerned their soaps will look dated compared to BBC rival EastEnders.

Sources have claimed producers are worried their new coronavirus-friendly filming methods do not hold up to their BBC rivals, who are using clever new techniques with the help of perspex screens, CGI and stand-ins.

So far Corrie and Emmerdale have used clever editing and filming angles to hide the use to social distancing during production, but have been forced to eliminate kissing and other intimate scenes.

A source told The Sun: 'Everyone backstage is miffed because they think both Corrie and Emmerdale are going to look really dated now Enders is back.  

'So whereas Corrie and Enders bosses ruled out perspex screens early on — so there's no kissing or sex scenes and everyone is clearly two metres apart — they are now looking at copying the idea so they don't look low-rent compared to Enders. 

'But ­obviously it's going to take a while before fans see the ­difference on screen, as they have already filmed so much.

The insider added that some crew members suggested the use of perspex screens during filming, but their ideas were 'pushed back.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Coronation Street and Emmerdale for comment at the time of publication.

Coronation Street and Emmerdale were the first soaps to resume filming following the COVID-19 crisis, and have introduced one-way systems and strict social distancing rules during filming.

Both shows were able to avoid going off-air during the pandemic, though did reduce their weekly episodes to just six per week. They will return to their usual schedules on Monday, September 14th. 

Revolutionary: EastEnders finally returned to screens on Monday after a three-month break, and have introduced an array of new methods

Meanwhile EastEnders finally returned to screens on Monday after a three-month break, and have introduced an array of new methods to try and hide the use of social distancing.

Among them are the use of perspex screens between characters, which will also be used in kiss scenes before being edited out, along with CGI to create the illusion of two characters being in the same room.

Executive producer Jon Sen also told MailOnline that in some cases cast members' real-life partners are being used as stand-ins for intimate scenes.
