She officially broke up with her boyfriend Scott Disick last month.

And Sofia Richie looked as if she'd moved on as she was spotted wrapping her arms around a male friend on Wednesday in Malibu, California.

The 22-year-old model was seen getting close to the new man while spending some time with friends by the sea.

Sofia was spotted hanging out with some of her pals near a beach volleyball net.

She showed off her toned and tanned tummy in a white cropped tank top, which she wore with high-waisted black shorts. 

The 5ft6in beauty had her blonde locks styled straight and parted down the middle so that they cascaded down her shoulders.

She also wore a thick gold luxury wristwatch and blocked out the sun with reflective sunglasses.

Sofia's friend was dressed in a red hoodie for the Apple Pan, the classic LA burger joint that opened in 1947 and later inspired nostalgia-drenched chains like Johnny Rockets. 

After Sofia wrapped her arms around his shoulders, he returned the affectionate gesture by patting her on her head as she sat at a table. 

Later on Wednesday, Sofia shared a photo of herself in the same white ribbed crop top as she sat in her car.

She gave a closeup of her sunglasses and her impeccably made-up face while running her fingers through her hair.

Sofia was back in the US in recent days after traveling to Mexico late last month to celebrate her 22nd birthday with friends.

She documented the trip with some throwback photos of her lavish Cabo San Lucas villa to Instagram last week.

The model's recent outings come after it was reported in May that she and Scott Disick had separated following his brief rehab stay over the summer.

The couple were rumored to have gotten back together in July, but their split was confirmed again in August.

A source who spoke to People said Scott's family commitments led to their breakup.

'It's always been difficult for them to balance their relationship with Scott's family life. His kids will always come first,' they said.

Another insider said, 'Scott's focus is his health and the kids. Sofia wants to hang out with friends and enjoy the summer. Since they are no longer on the same page, they decided to just be apart. At least for now.'

 Last month, a source told UsWeekly that Sofia 'isn't upset' about the breakup, adding that she 'is not thinking about Scott at all.' 

'Her friends and family have been surrounding her with so much love and support, especially for her birthday, so that's been a nice distraction for her,' the source added.
