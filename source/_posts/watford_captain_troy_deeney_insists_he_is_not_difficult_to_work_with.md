Watford captain Troy Deeney has hit back strongly to claims he is difficult to work with by suggesting people can be uncomfortable that he 'speaks his mind'. 

Deeney has become increasingly irritated by suggestions he is tough to be around and a bad trainer and both claims were debunked by the striker. 

Speaking to the Sun, Deeney said: 'I have heard these stories going around. It's being said I'm a difficult individual and it's very frustrating, to be honest.

The Watford captain said that he speaks his mind but that does not make him 'difficult'

'I've never had an issue where somebody has publicly said "Troy's difficult to work with". These are things being said by people who don't know me. Maybe it's because I speak my mind and that's uncomfortable for people sometimes.

'Should you bend who you are to please others? I don't think that's the right way to go about things.'

Deeney was part of the Watford side that suffered relegation on the final day of the pandemic-interrupted 2019-20 Premier League season. 

 The 32-year-old striker also criticised whispers that he is a bad trainer for returning late

But the 32-year-old is generating interest from the top flight - namely West Brom - and with the new season approaching, Deeney was determined to debunk rumours of his behaviour. 

He describes himself as a 'soldier' for the team due to his total commitment but did admit that if things were going wrong he would speak out. 

In the run-in of their relegation season, Deeney was quizzed on an alleged fight at half-time in the dressing room in a match against West Ham. He was also asked whether he was having a say in team selection following the dismissal of Nigel Pearson. 

Deeney denied both of those at the time and has since continued to put the record straight in a bid to ensure his reputation is not knocked by what he believes are inaccurate assessments of his character. 

Due to family reasons, Deeney came back a week later than others in the Covid-19 pandemic

The striker scored 10 Premier League goals in an injury-ravaged campaign last season and yet he is confident that he can still cut it in the top flight, backing his body to hold up if he does secure a move away from Watford. 

Watford appear open to selling the striker as they look to balance the books following their relegation.

Indeed, Deeney is one of a clutch of players who is not required to take a pay reduction following their relegation which increases the likelihood of the club listening to offers for the talismanic skipper.
