Thiago Alcantara has arrived at Liverpool's training ground to finalise his £25million move to Anfield from Bayern Munich. 

The 29-year-old midfielder has been Jurgen Klopp's top target all summer and Liverpool finally made a breakthrough in their negotiations with Bayern on Thursday after they agreed to pay a minimum of £20m over the next four years, along with £5m in add-ons.

The Premier League champions had been fairly quiet in this summer's transfer window, but have sprung into action and the signing of Thiago, who was a target of Manchester United, will send a big message to their closest rivals.

And on Friday, the Spaniard was seen arriving at Liverpool's Melwood training after leaving Hans Dieter-Flick's side to start a new chapter at Anfield. 

Thiago arrived at the training complex in a black Mercedes. Earlier today, Thiago said an emotional farewell to the German club, where he has starred for seven years. 

'Yes, I've made the most difficult decision of my sporting career,' he said. 

Thiago's arrival will come as a huge boost to Jurgen Klopp's Premier League champions

'I will close this chapter in this wonderful club, the club where I grew and developed myself as a player during the last seven years.

'Victories, success, joyful moments and some hard times as well. But what I am most proud of is having arrived in Munich being a young man full of dreams and leaving completely fulfilled and identified with a club, a history, a philosophy, a language and a culture.

'Here I learnt how to love and respect a tradition that I am now saying goodbye to but which I will never forget.

'Me and my family have lived amazing moments in the city, at Sabener Strasse, and of course, in our beloved Allianz Arena. With you, my Bayern family who treated me so well and loved me every second.

'My decision is purely sports related. As a football player, I want and I need new challenges in order to develop myself as I did here.

'Bayern will always be my home. Thank you, FC Bayern.'

Thiago joins a star-studded Liverpool squad and will compete with the likes of Fabinho, Naby Keita, Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum for a starting position in Klopp's midfield.
