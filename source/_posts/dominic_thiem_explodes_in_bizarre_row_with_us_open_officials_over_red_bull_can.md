Dominic Thiem erupted into a bizarre row with tournament bosses at the US Open after not being allowed to drink straight from his Red Bull can because it is not one of their sponsors.

The second seed marked his 27th birthday with a commanding 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over India's Sumit Nagal on Thursday, though it was somewhat overshadowed by his heated dispute with US Open chiefs.

Thiem was angered when he was told late into the match that his can of Red Bull had to be poured out into a plain cup away from his sight and TV cameras as the beverage company does not sponsor the tournament.

Dominic Thiem became embroiled in a row with US Open officials over a Red Bull can

Thiem was angry that tournament bosses wanted to pour it into a blank cup out of his sight

Footage emerged online showing world No 3 Thiem rowing with a US Open official, in which he was heard saying: 'You guys are like crazy about anti-doping and then you want to carry the Red Bull can out and you guys fill it in a blank cup.

'I mean what the heck is this? Just bring me a blank cup and I'll pour it in.'

The Austrian, who is seeking his maiden Grand Slam title, was eventually allowed to pour the drink himself while a white towel was held over him to prevent the Red Bull logo from being visible.

The incident happened during Thiem's match with India's Sumit Nagal on Thursday

The Austrian won 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 to set up a mouthwatering third-round tie with Marin Cilic

Thiem admitted the incident 'p***** him off' after claiming a straight-sets victory to set up a mouthwatering third-round tie with 2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic. 

'They wanted to go out with the open can and fill it in a plain cup without me observing it,' Thiem said.

'That's what p***** me off a little bit because the anti-doping rules are so strict. I don't want to lose the can out of my sight... and they propose me to fill the can in a plain cup without me observing it.

'That p***** me off a little bit.'
