Aston Villa are interested in a potential loan deal for Chelsea's Ross Barkley or team-mate Ruben Loftus Cheek as they look to strengthen their midfield.

Villa had asked about Tammy Abraham earlier in the window but he didn't want to leave Stamford Bridge.

They can only sign one on loan due to Premier League rules.

West Ham had also been interested, as they are in Antonio Rudiger, but are wary of being drawn into negotiations over a deal for Declan Rice.

David Moyes has no desire to sell Rice.

Barkley played 90 minutes of Chelsea's Carabao Cup victory over Barnsley on Wednesday night, scoring his side's third goal.

Loftus-Cheek, meanwhile, was left out after Frank Lampard was left disappointed by his performance in their opening-day win over Brighton earlier this month.

The England midfielder came in for criticism from Gary Neville after that game with the former Manchester United man saying he could have no complaints if Chelsea decided to offload him.

'I thought, Loftus-Cheek, he's been given his chance,' Neville told Sky Sports after the match at Brighton. 

'I thought he was really disappointing. I don't think Loftus-Cheek can complain. He's been given games.

'I don't think he's ever grasped his chance yet. There's going to come a point when they're going to cash in and get £25million for him.'
