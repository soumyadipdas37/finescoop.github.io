Deontay Wilder should retire from boxing if he refuses to fight Tyson Fury in a rematch later this year, says Eddie Hearn.

The 34-year-old American suffered his first defeat of his career back in February when the Gypsy King conquered him inside seven rounds to claim the WBC title.

Wilder has since activated his rematch clause but has remained sheepishly quiet since his defeat in Las Vegas.

As a result, Hearn is questioning whether the American will go ahead with the blockbuster trilogy bout that is due to take place in December.

But if he doesn't, the Matchroom promoter believes Wilder has little reason to continue his heavyweight career. 

Hearn told iFL TV: 'If Deontay Wilder doesn't take that rematch, he should retire from boxing.

'What's the point? You've been a world heavyweight champion, and now you've lost and your bum's gone.

And Hearn insists Wilder should hang up his gloves if he refuses the trilogy bout in December

'You've bottled the rematch, and he won't. He's got more about him than that. But he's worryingly quiet, isn't he?'

The prospect of Wilder dropping out and freeing Fury up come the end of the year has put British boxing fans on red alert, which would see Fury and Anthony Joshua take a step closer to their unification fight next year.

However, Hearn has ruled out the idea of Joshua and Fury fighting in December because of AJ's mandatory title defence commitments to Kubrat Pulev.

Hearn added: '[Fury is] under contract for another fight. No, we're not under contract yet, but we have to agree to terms with Pulev now.

'We probably will [fight Pulev]. Fury doesn't want to get out of his contract for the trilogy match with Wilder.

Hearn says Anthony Joshua will likely agree a deal to fight mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev

'Why would he? Next to a fight with Joshua, it's the best money Fury can make, and it's a match that will help increase his popularity in the US.

'We're probably a lot freer to take the fight in December than [Fury] is.

'Whether that is to goad us or to challenge us, we accept that challenge to fight in December if you don't have to fight Deontay Wilder.

'But you do have to fight Deontay Wilder.'
