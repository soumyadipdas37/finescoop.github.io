Sharon Stone shared a clip on Wednesday where she was bonding with a monkey named Pablo who co-stars with her in the Netflix series Ratched.

The video was taken when the 62-year-old actress first met the famed animal who has also shared the screen with Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush on Pirates Of The Caribbean.

'When we met❤️,' wrote the Basic Instinct veteran in her caption.

Monkeying around: Sharon Stone shared a clip on Wednesday where she was bonding with a monkey named Pablo who co-stars with her in the Netflix series Ratched

 They made a good pair: The blonde with Pablo on her shoulder during a scene from Ratched; the little guy even had a dress made especially for him

'He's just checking me for I think lice, Dr Pablo... he's looking for all my problems and we're fixing them all up,' said the star gently as the primate looked at her ears, eyebrows and neck.

'He's making sure I am fine to work with, so far so good' the Sliver star joked. 'He's protecting me.'

The star was seen at home on a dark sofa as she wore her blonde hair back and had on minimal makeup.

The former beauty pageant queen seem fascinated by the monkey as he looked in her ear. 

Stone told Town & Country that at first she didn't want to work with a money but creator Ryan Murphy insisted.

So close: 'He's just checking me for I think lice, Dr Pablo... he's looking for all my problems and we're fixing them all up,' said the star gently as the primate looked at her ears, eyebrows and neck

Funny: 'He's making sure I am fine to work with, so far so good' the Sliver star joked. 'He's protecting me'

'I was like, "No, Ryan, no, I can’t have a monkey,’” Stone told the magazine.

'I’m like, "I worked with leopards in Africa. I’m comfortable with leopards."'

But Murphy would not let up:' "No. Has to be a monkey for Christ’s sake,"' Sharon  said in a stern voice.

The star gave in but wanted to cast the monkey herself. 'There was a monkey that had worked on Pirates of the Caribbean that was great. A real pro monkey,' she told Ryan.

'I’m like, "Let’s get the monkey in. Can I please meet this monkey at my house?"'

A fabulous character: Playing Lenore Osgood in Ratched has been a thrill for her. 'She’s completely insane,' says Stone with a sly smile. 'And at the same time she thinks she’s really a loving mother who has her sh*t together'

And then the primate came to her Beverly Hills mansion for a meet and greet. 

Ratched costume designer Lou Eyrich told W magazine a wardrobe was made for the little guy: 'The very first day that the monkeys came for a fitting, we were all just captivated. Everybody wanted to come and peek in fitting room. 

'The handler brought two of them, so we made outfits for each, with matching pantaloons or little panties underneath their party dresses. But we actually only ended up really filming with one of the monkeys, whose name was Pablo.'

He has a good resume! Pablo seen here with Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp in  Pirates Of The Caribbean - At World's End in 2007

Playing Lenore Osgood in Ratched has been a thrill for Stone, she also told Town & Country. 'She’s completely insane,' says Stone with a sly smile. 'And at the same time she thinks she’s really a loving mother who has her sh*t together.'

Still on top: Stone talked her new role in Town & Country

To help with her role, Sharon thought out the character's back story. 

'I thought she was probably Doris Duke’s best friend—she was a showgirl who married some rich guy and knocked him off,' she said.

'She would try to be fancy, because the more fabulous she was the less people would know that she came from nowhere and was a complete criminal.'   

Also in T&C Stone said she had experienced sexual harassment at the height of her career.

Stone did not offer too many details about her sexual harassment story with the unnamed director - who denied the story to the publication - but she did convey the tension well. 

'He’d tell me that I should sit on his lap to get direction for the scene,' said Stone.

'And when I told him that I was not going to sit on his lap, he would send me back to the trailer. And that is just the way it was.'

The incident took place when she was 'at the height of her earning power,' the magazine explained. Stone reportedly made her most money for Basic Instinct 2 in 2006 with over $13M.

An icon: When playing cunning author Catherine Trammel in 1992's Basic Instinct, Sharon showed off a cold, calculated sexuality

Her sex symbol image still lingers, which surprises the veteran.

'People still want to see my boobs. I’m 62! It’s like, "Really? Grow up!" But also, "Here’s some boobs!"' she said with a theatrical gesture.

As far as how she came to fame in the early Nineties, she says the public wanted a pinup.

'People, I guess, really needed a sex symbol,' said the Pennsylvania native.

'I mean, I never thought I was that sexy... When I did Basic Instinct, I explored my dark side and made friends with my dark side. I got to not be afraid of my own self. I think people find that sexy.'

But having people expect her to be a sex symbol all the time is taxing.  'It was very difficult for Marilyn Monroe. She did movies that really mattered, like Bus Stop, The Misfits, but she still couldn’t get completely out of being that thing. It’s very hard to shake,' said the mother of three.

There was also a time when Sharon was hardly employed because of the old Hollywood rules that still apply. 'You don’t really get work between 40 and 60. It doesn’t matter if you’re at the height of your career, whether you just made Casino. That’s it: no work,' said the movie queen. Casino came out in 1995.
