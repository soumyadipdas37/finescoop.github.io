The original Purple Wiggle, Jeff Fatt, is returning to children's group.

The fan favourite will replace Lachlan 'Lachy' Gillespie while he takes some time off following the birth of his twin daughters. 

The 67-year-old has decided to return to the band to film a four-part series, The Wiggly World of Dance Classes.

The classes will be hosted on Big W's Facebook page over the next four weeks. 

The Wiggly World of Dance Classes aims to showcase a range of dance styles that children can enjoy in the comfort of their own home.  

Jeff retired from the children's group in 2012, but has decided to fill in for Lachy while he enjoys some bonding time with his new babies.
