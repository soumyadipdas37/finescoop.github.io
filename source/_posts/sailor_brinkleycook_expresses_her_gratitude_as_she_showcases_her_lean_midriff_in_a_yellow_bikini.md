Sailor Brinkley-Cook flashed a bright smile in a pinup photo shared to Instagram on Wednesday.  

The 22-year-old daughter of supermodel Christie Brinkley showed plenty of her glowing skin while in a tiny yellow bikini. 

As she shielded her eyes from the sun with her hand, the former Dancing With The Star contestant displayed her gym-honed midriff and appeared to be having a great  time.

'Gratitude is the attitude,' she captioned the shot of herself standing in front of the ocean for her nearly 200,000 Instagram followers.  

While relaxing on the beach, the beauty sported a pair of lowrise string bottoms and styled her wavy blonde tresses in a low ponytail. 

Hours prior on her Instagram Story, Sailor shared footage of a 'magical' sunset and mini photo shoot in front of a white Jeep.
