Maura Higgins plays down her 'man-eater' reputation by admitting she's 'only ever been on one date' and is 'scared' to meet a new boyfriend.

The reality star, 29, told MailOnline she would be a 'nervous wreck' on a first date despite charming countless men on Love Island last summer.

Behind her confident exterior, the Irish beauty said her lack of experience in courting the opposite sex in the real world has left her fearful of when she'll meet her next partner. 

'I'm 29 and I've been on one date!': Maura Higgins plays down her 'man-eater' reputation by admitting she's only ever been on one date and is 'scared' to meet a new boyfriend

In an exclusive interview, Maura, who's expanding her makeup collection with Inglot by releasing three gift sets this Christmas, said: 'I am ready to start dating again.

'But the thing is I've only ever been on one date aside from Love Island.

'I know we did a lot of dating on the show but you're in a completely different environment.

'Putting that aside, I've been on one date and that was with the guy I was with before Love Island, so I'm not used to the dating scene at all.

'I wouldn't know what to do myself': The reality star told MailOnline she would be a 'nervous wreck' on a first date despite charming countless men on Love Island last summer 

'I'm 29 and I've been on one date! When I think of it like that it's quite scary.

'I would be a nervous wreck on a date, which sounds crazy because I'm a confident woman but I wouldn't know what to do myself.'  

Maura is aware not to force herself into meeting someone as she approaches a milestone birthday this November, and has already soothed any turning 30 panics.

She said: 'I have thought about this… and I have thought "argh I'm turning 30 and I'm single" but then I also think I don't want to put pressure on myself.

'I need to just roll with it': Maura has reminded herself not to put pressure on finding a new man as she approaches her 30th birthday this November 

'If I do that then how am I ever going to meet someone? I need to stop thinking about it and just roll with it and see what happens.

'I feel for me anyone I meet; I always trust them until they do me wrong, which I feel is important. I can't paint everyone with the same brush. I just need to trust somebody and see how it goes.' 

Instead of looking for love, as she did in the ITV2 villa, Maura hopes to meet someone new the old fashioned way, and has sworn off dating apps.

She said: 'I feel like I have to meet someone face to face. Even with my Instagram DMs I don't message anyone back.

'I want to meet someone organically': Instead of looking for love, as she did in the ITV2 villa, Maura hopes to meet someone new the old fashioned way, and has sworn off dating apps

'I just can't bring myself to meet someone through social media and that's why I won't go on dating apps because I know me, I want to meet someone organically, say if it's on a night out or an event.'

Maura has been linked to a number of potential suitors following her split earlier this year from ex-Curtis Pritchard.

In August, speculation started to mount over her relationship with Love Island co-star Chris Taylor after the pair spent the night together following a restaurant date.

But Maura remains adamant that she and Chris are plutonic and only share love of the 'same banter.'

Over: Maura has been linked to a number of potential suitors following her split earlier this year from ex-Curtis Pritchard, who she met while appearing on Love Island in 2019 

She said: 'Chris is one of my best friends. A lot of people have said we're dating but it's only because we get on so well.

'We click and have the same banter. We got on so well in the villa but I don't think our friendship was shown at all.

'A lot of people assumed we got friendly outside of the show but that wasn't the case – we clicked straight away.'

Maura launched her 34-piece makeup range with Inglot in June and now following the success of the line, is releasing gifts sets for Christmas. 

The three gift sets include 'Naughty but Nice,' a lip liner and gloss set, 'Rebel in You,' a lip liner and lipstick and 'All the Drama,' which is an eye pallet.

Maura said: 'I've always wanted to have my own lip kits and for Christmas they're absolutely perfect.

'With the lip liners you don't always need to use a gloss because they're so nourishing – some days I wear a lip liner all over.

'The colours I have chosen for the lip kits work really well together and they're also great for day and night.

'Obviously I had to bring out an eye kit as well; as everyone knows I'm obsessed with winged eyeliner and the cat eye look. 

'I was so, so nervous bringing out my first collection. I was shaking before it first went live, we all just can't believe how well it's done.'

The INGLOT x MAURA collection is available to buy on Inglot's website, as well as Boots and Missguided
