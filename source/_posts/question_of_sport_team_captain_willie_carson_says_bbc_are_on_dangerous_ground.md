Former A Question of Sport team captain Willie Carson has said the BBC is on 'dangerous ground' by ditching host Sue Barker.

The former tennis player, 64, has been axed as host of the show, alongside team captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell, so that bosses can draft in fresh talent to revamp the long-running sports quiz. 

Mr Carson, 77, who was a team captain in 1972, told the Daily Express: 'The BBC are on dangerous ground because these are big shoes to fill. Very big shoes to fill.

Mr Carson, 77, who was a team captain in 1972, said: 'The BBC are on dangerous ground because these are big shoes to fill. Very big shoes to fill'

'It seems a little bit harsh in a way, because it seems to be a very successful team.

'I'm sure most people were very happy the way the format is at the moment. I certainly am.

'They have great chemistry between the three of them - seems a shame to lose that.' 

Mr Carson was particularly critical of BBC middle-management for getting rid of Miss Barker, who will continue with presenting duties for the next two summers at Wimbledon, having signed a three-year deal last year.

He added: 'People sitting at a desk think they can do better.

'The racing term is: people in the stands can ride the horse better than the fellow on top, the jockey. That's what's happening.' 

Jermaine Jenas and Alex Scott have both been tipped to join A Question of Sport in the future

Sources previously disclosed to Sportsmail that Alex Scott, the former Arsenal and England defender, is well-liked by the broadcaster and in the mix to replace Barker as presenter. 

Ex-Tottenham and England midfielder Jermaine Jenas is also in the running to become one of the new team captains, with the BBC keen to diversify.  

The final series of A Question Of Sport featuring Miss Barker, Tufnell and Dawson will be shown next year. 

The BBC told the Daily Express that 'no conversations have been had about the future line-up.'
