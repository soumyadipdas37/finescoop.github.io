Frontrunner Bella Varelis was trolled by fans and labelled the 'villain' after turning on best friend Irena Srbinovska during Thursday night's episode of The Bachelor.

And now it can be revealed Bella does not get sent home by Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert following her jealous antics, in on-set photos at the mansion in Sydney's Oxford Falls.

Pictures taken on July 13 show Locky, 30, choosing his final three in the competition: Bella, Irena, and intruder Bec Cvilikas.

Bella was dressed to impress in a white gown, featuring a bodice that cinched in at her tiny waist.  

Sheer fabric from the waist down revealed her trim pins, while nude heels elongated her frame.

The marketing consultant's brunette locks were styled loosely around her face and shoulders, and her makeup was elegant. 

Countdown: Pictures taken on July 13 at the mansion at Sydney's Oxford Falls, show Locky, 30, choosing his final three in the competition

Locking lips: The marketing professional enjoyed a steamy kiss with the Australian Survivor star

Bella appears to still be the frontrunner, pictured enjoying a steamy kiss with Locky in the grounds of the mansion.

She wrapped her arms around the Australian Survivor star, gazing into his eyes as they shared quality one-on-one time together. 

Bella was also seen heading into the mansion, presumably for the rose ceremony.

Sheer daring: Bella's gown featured sheer fabric from the waist down, revealing her trim pins

Embrace: Bella wrapped her arms around Locky while in the mansion's gardens 

Production team: Camera crew were there to capture every moment 

Beauty: Bella's brunette locks were styled loosely around her face and shoulders, and her makeup was elegant 

A production assistant used a large umbrella to conceal her face, however her dress was a clear giveaway. 

Irena also appears to be one of the final three - a woman matching her description in a red beaded frock was seen entering the mansion.

Like Bella, she also used a large umbrella to hide her face.

Off to the rose ceremony? Bella was also seen being led to the front door of the mansion by a member of production

Safety first: Production wore protective face masks amid COVID-19

One other contestant in a black gown, possibly Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29, was also seen entering the mansion.  

Tough decision: Locky appeared tense, perhaps after choosing his final three ladies

Is that you, Irena? Another contestant in a red dress, presumably Irena Srbinovska, 31, was seen heading into the mansion 

Hidden: The contestant was also given a large umbrella

Bella's sighting seemingly confirms her feud with Irena on Thursday's episode, does not see her being booted from the mansion.  

After weeks of tension, Irena pulled Bella aside for a private conversation to see if they could resolve their differences.

But it didn't take long for things to escalate, with Bella labelling Irena 'a manipulative little b***h', before storming off.

On the move: The starlet looked to have made her way over to the mansion's gardens 

Arrival: Another contestant with blonde hair, presumably intruder Bec Cvilikas, 25, arrived at the mansion 

Details: The contestant looked glamorous in their frock, which they teamed with metallic heels 

Helping hand: Production were on hand to escort the ladies 

After telling Irena she didn't trust her, Bella stood up and stormed off mid-conversation.

'Friendship done. I'm f**king over your bulls**t, to be honest! You're a manipulative little b**ch!' she shouted.

Irena confessed she was 'in complete and utter shock' at Bella's reaction, and agreed that their friendship was effectively over.

Tresses: The contestant's blonde curly locks could be seen underneath the umbrella 

On the go: She looked to have made her way over to the mansion's gardens 

Careful: The beauty picked up her dress with one hand, as she made her way across the mansion's grounds

Crew: A production member was on hand to help her with her dress 

The show's fans appeared just as stunned as Irena, processing Bella's seemingly uncharacteristic meltdown on Twitter.

'Jeez, I thought Bella was a Disney Princess, I guess not,' tweeted one shocked fan, while another added, 'First time I haven't liked Bella. Overreaction much? Irena's taking over as No.1'. 

Others compared Bella to Roxi Kenny, who quickly developed a reputation as the show's resident drama queen.  

Clothing: The starlet came prepared with sneakers and a statement top to change into 

Outfit change: She was later seen in a pair of light blue jeans, the statement top and perspex heels 

Looking good: Despite being in a less glamorous ensemble, she was still dressed to impress 

Casual: Her curly tresses were visible as she made her way across the mansion's grounds. She also had changed into a pair of denim shorts 

Comfy: She held onto a black jacket and changed into comfortable white sneakers 

'Bella has somehow morphed into Roxi,' commented one viewer, while another tweeted, 'Man, Bella on #TheBachelorAU is really pulling a Roxi'.

Some fans thought Bella's reaction to Irena wanting to have a discussion reflected her maturity levels.

'Bella was my fave but now she just seems immature and selfish,' tweeted one fan, while another added, 'I'm getting flashbacks to year seven watching this'.   

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.  

Sighting: One other contestant in a black gown, possibly Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29, was also seen entering the mansion 

Pulling out all the stops: Production went to great lengths to ensure her identity was hidden
