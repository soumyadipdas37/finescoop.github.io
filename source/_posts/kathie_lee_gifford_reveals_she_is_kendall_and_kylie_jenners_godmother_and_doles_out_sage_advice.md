Kathie Lee Gifford and Kris Jenner go way back.

And, Gifford revealed that the pair are so close that she is actually the godmother to Kris' youngest girls, Kendall and Kylie Jenner.

The 67-year-old television host dished on her goddaughters during an appearance with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live Tuesday night.  

One big family: Kathie Lee Gifford revealed that she is the godmother to Kendall and Kylie Jenner during an appearance with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live Tuesday night

'By the time I moved away from California they were still very, very little, so I've obviously not had a whole lot of influence on their lives,' Kathie Lee said of the 24-year-old supermodel and her 23-year-old billionaire sister. 

Gifford added: 'But I adore them. I adore all of them. They're part of my life. I've known Kris since I was in my early 20s, when I first started my career in California.' 

Kathie Lee was on the late-night show along with the iconic Gloria Estefan, and during a round of fan questions, Andy asked what advice she's given her famous goddaughters.

'I would tell them, first of all, stay close to God. And they sometimes do!' she said with a laugh. 'I would tell them to be true to themselves. That's about it. That's what I tell everybody.'

'By the time I moved away from California they were still very, very little, so I've obviously not had a whole lot of influence on their lives,' Kathie Lee said of the 24-year-old supermodel and her 23-year-old billionaire sister.

 'But I adore them. I adore all of them. They're part of my life. I've know [their mom] Kris [Jenner] since I was in my early 20s, when I first started my career in California.'

Things in the Kardashian/Jenner world have certainly changed quite a bit since Kris and Kathie Lee first became friends.

In fact, the former Today Show host told People Magazine last year that she once lent Kris money back when she had fallen on a hard time.

'Kris was having financial problems,' she said in the 2019 interview. 'I loaned Kris money years ago because they needed it. They were really struggling.'  

'I would tell them, first of all, stay close to God. And they sometimes do!' Kathie Lee aid with a laugh when asked what advice she would give them. 'I would tell them to be true to themselves. That's about it. That's what I tell everybody.' (Kylie and Kendall pictured in 2017)

Now, the family is one of the most recognizable names in the world and Kylie alone is worth a billion dollars. 

'They're not superstars or billionaires when they come into this world. They were just my dear friend's children,' Kathie Lee reflected during her chat with Andy. 'That's what all we celebrities are anyway at the end of the day really, we're just people.'

She added: 'We have a celebrity crazed culture and we put people on pedestals that we're not made for. People aren't supposed to sit where only God should sit.

'We make huge mistakes [when] we make our idols out of human beings, 'cause they're going to topple and fall. Unfortunately in our culture people love to see the fall. I hate it. I hate to see people ruined or destroyed.'
