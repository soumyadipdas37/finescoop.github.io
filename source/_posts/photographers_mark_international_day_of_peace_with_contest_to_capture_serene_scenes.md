Photographers captured scenes of serenity from around the globe as part of a contest to mark the International Day of Peace. 

The competition, organised by photo app Agora, challenged photographers to submit an image illustrating what 'peace' means to them.

More than 11.000 photos capturing peace were sent from all over the globe, with snapper Rashid Ibrahim, 23, from Kenya being the winner. 

His powerful shot 'A peaceful world is a fruitful one' gathered the most votes from the Agora global community, making him the #Peace2020 Hero and winning him the top prize of $1,000. 

The beautiful photo, captured in Nairobi, shows a man in army fatigues holding up a white flag and there are five other young men looking at the soldier, who is offering peace. 

Other entries that made it in the top five were the meditating young boy in Myanmar,  a diver exploring the sea in Menorca, Spain, a young woman enjoying the nature in Dolomites, Italy and a woman praying Kraton Kasunanan Surakarta, Indonesia.
