She's known to many for her role as Mandy Richardson in Hollyoaks.

And Sarah Jayne Dunn was looking as stylish as ever in a tight black mini dress as she headed out for dinner in Manchester on Saturday.

The actress, 38, put on a leggy display in the tight dress as she enjoyed a meal at the Scene Indian Restaurant.

Sarah showcased her toned physique in the tight black ribbed t-shirt dress as she stepped out for the evening.

The soap star accessorised the dress with thigh-high black boots with silver studs and her blonde bob styled into loose curls.

Sarah added a cheeky pop of colour to her look with a statement red lip as she enjoyed the night out.

Sarah is mum to son Stanley, four, with her husband Jon Smith, who she married in May 2018 at The Holford Estate in Plumley, Cheshire. 

Sarah revealed last October that Stanley had been rushed to hospital and she was having an 'emotionally draining' week.

Alongside a picture of herself on set with Stephanie Waring, she wrote: 'I’ve had the most emotionally draining & stressful week of my life. I can’t wait for my little man to be back to full health first & foremost.

'Then I can’t wait to be back on set doing a job that I love & working with people that make me smile. Love ya @stephwaring Fingers crossed it won’t be much longer before I’m back.'

Sarah chose not to disclose what illness her son had in the post, which she tagged as being at the Royal Bolton Hospital.

She and Jon welcomed their first child together in August 2016, and the actress has since embarked on an intense fitness journey.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline recently, the star revealed she was motivated to transform her physique after 'everything got bigger' during pregnancy and that she wanted to tone up in preparation for her wedding.
