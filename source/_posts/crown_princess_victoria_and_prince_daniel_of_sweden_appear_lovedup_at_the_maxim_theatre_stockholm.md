Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden appeared loved-up as they attended the Maxim Theatre in Stockholm today. 

The smiling couple visited the private film screening theatre which has been struggling to stay open for business due to the 50-person gathering limit currently in force in Sweden.

As they approached the establishment, the happy pair beamed as they strolled arm in arm along the streets of the country's capital.

The happy couple smiled widely as they stood outside the Maxim Theatre before they entered. Princess Victoria wore an impressive all-red ensemble and her husband Prince Daniel donned a dark grey double-breasted suit

Crown Princess Victoria, 43, wore a beautiful black and plum ensemble and her husband Prince Daniel, 47, donned a dark grey double-breasted suit with a deep blue tie. 

The Swedish royal cut an elegant figure, wearing a printed midi-length dress which she paired with a purple jacket and matching tassel earrings.

To finish off the impressively co-ordinated look, she added some pointed high heels in a similar shade and carried a clutch bag to finish it off.

In her signature style, the King's eldest daughter wore her hair slicked back into a neat ponytail for the occasion.

As they strolled through the streets of the capital towards the theatre, the couple beamed as they walked arm in arm. Princess Victoria cut an elegant figure in her printed black and burgundy dres

To complete her look, she also wore a pair of matching high heels, some tassel earrings in a similar shade and even coordinated her clutch bag to match her burgundy themed outfit

Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, who used to be her personal trainer, are parents to Princess Estelle, eight, and Prince Oscar, four. 

The mother of two is the eldest daughter of King Carl Gustaf 74, and Queen Silvia, 76, who have two other children - Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland, married to Princess Sofia, Duchess of Värmland, and Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, married to Christopher O'Neill. 

During their visit, the couple took a look around the private theatre which hosts film screenings but has been struggling to stay in business in recent months as Sweden cracks down on the number of people gathering
