His older sister Khloe Kardashian recently used her social media presence to raise awareness about the ongoing military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

And Rob Kardashian decided to lend his voice to the cause on Tuesday evening by sharing the truth of the matter with his 1.9million Instagram followers.

'In the fog of the pandemic & global crises, #Armenians in #Artsakh have been the victims of unprovoked attacks by #Azerbaijan,' began the 33-year-old KUWTK star.

Artsakh, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, is a disputed region between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  

Although it is recognized as part of Azerbaijan by the international community, it's ruled by an independent government and is primarily comprised of ethnic Armenians.

Dozens of Azerbaijani and Armenian service members have been killed in recent days as the two sides have begun fighting. 

Rob continued in his caption: 'We appeal to the international community to continue to condemn these attacks. From the highest levels of leadership, we know Armenia & Artsakh want peace.'

Kardashian told to his 1.9million followers that 'anything else [they] read is disingenuous & false,' before urging them to 'call [their] representatives' by visiting the webiste anca.org/call.

Just like Khloe's original post, Rob encouraged his followers to follow his friend Eric Esrailian, a gastroenterologist who teaches at UCLA and a film producer, for updates on the conflict, which she described as 'unprovoked attacks — by Azerbaijan — against civilian #Armenians in #Artsakh.' 

'You can also provide support for the We Are Our Borders/All For Artsakh #ArstakhStrong campaign to provide charitable support via: armeniafund.org/donate #Wearestillhere,' he concluded.

Along with his powerful words, Rob included a cinematic photo of the Flag of Artsakh blowing in the wind.

Rob and Khloe, as well as sisters Kim and Kourtney, hold Armenia so close to their hearts because they are of Armenian descent through their late father, Robert Kardashian.

Robert Kardashian, who is known for being part of O.J. Simpson's 'Dream Team,' passed away in September of 2003 after enduring a short, but strenuous battle with esophageal cancer.

Though he does not use social media as much as his sisters, Rob recently honored his only child, daughter Dream, three, on Nation Daughter's Day.

'Happy National Daughter Day @dream,' captioned Kardashian as he shared a throwback snapshot of his baby girl resting in his arms.

It was announced earlier this month that his family's long running reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be coming to an end after 20 seasons on the E! network.

With Rob not having been on the show in more recent seasons, series regulars Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, and Kris all released statement regarding the show's closure.

'It is with heavy hearts that we’ve made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' began Kim on Instagram, who shared an image of the series' first ever promo poster.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who’ve watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We’ll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we’ve met along the way.'

Filming is already underway for the final season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, where Rob is expected to make a highly anticipated return.
