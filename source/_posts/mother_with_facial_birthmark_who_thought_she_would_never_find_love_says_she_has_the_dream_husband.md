A mother who was cruelly called the Batman character 'Two-Face' due to her large facial birthmark said she never thought she would find love - but now has her dream husband and kids. 

Chelsey Peat, 34, was born with a rare condition called Sturge-Weber Syndrome, a neurological disorder which means has a large birthmark on the left side of her face, along with glaucoma in her left eye. 

The mother-of-two from Lethbridge, Alberta, said bullies made her life a 'living hell', throughout school, with Chelsey being taunted daily and called cruel names such as 'monster' and 'freak'.

Chelsey said her tormenters also nicknamed her 'Two-Face', after the infamous Batman character who is horrifically scarred on the left side of his face following a chemical attack.

Such vicious abuse caused her self-esteem to plummet and Chelsey said she never thought she would ever find true love, walk down the aisle, or have kids and a real family of her own.

But after meeting Matt, 34, through mutual friends back in 2004, they began chatting more online and hit it off straight away - with the two eventually tying the knot in 2008.

And after the happy couple welcomed their daughters Athena, 13, and Zelda, three, Chelsey got the family she never dreamed she could have.

Now the inspirational mother is sharing her story to raise awareness about her condition and to give hope to others who may have been bullied for their facial differences.

Chelsey, who works part time in a hospital, said: 'It is so much more than just a birthmark, there is so much going on under the surface.

'It is a complete genetic mutation. There is nobody in my family who has the condition.

'I always sided with the poor defenceless characters in movies, such as the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the beast in Beauty and the Beast and the Phantom of the Opera.

'Those guys helped me growing up, because school was really hard.

'Ever since the release of the Batman Forever movie, I was given the nickname 'Two-Face' after the character who had half his face burnt with acid.

'I didn't have many friends growing up, it could be a very lonely time.

'You get to the age where you want boys to notice you but they didn't want a thing to do with me because I looked different.

'A few months before my high school grad dance, I prayed someone would ask me to go with them, but they never did.

'I longed to be like every other normal teen girl. Self-acceptance has been a battle.

'In my teen years, I'd put on thick layers of foundation to hide my birthmark.

'But then I came to a realisation later on. Why should I do the hiding and masking to make other people comfortable with me?'

Chelsey did not have the easiest start in life, undergoing brain surgery at just 18-months-old to stop her life-threatening seizures that were caused by her condition.

But doctors told her mother, Ione, 54, that her baby girl had just a 50 per cent chance of surviving the procedure - and if she did make it, would have a 50 per cent chance of living with serious mental disabilities.

Thankfully, Chelsey beat all the odds - but it was not long until she began asking her mother why she looked different to everyone else.

She said: 'I remember as a young child, people would come up to me and my mother asking how I got burnt, or thinking I had been beaten.

Now the mother-of-two has put her difficult past behind her and focuses on her husband and two children, Athena and Zelda

'My mom said there was a man who once wrapped his arms around her and told her that he could help the two of us get away from our abusive situation.

'But she was always very diplomatic and would educate people, which is something that stuck with me and is how I deal with those situations today.'

Chelsey added that the abuse took a heavy toll on her mental health, revealing that there were times she was in a very 'dark place' and never wanted to go outside.

She added that due to the torment she received from cruel bullies, her self-esteem was extremely low and she believed she would never get married or have children.

Chelsey suffered with low confidence after years of bullying due to her condition, but is now happily married to Matt 

But after meeting IT worker Matt through mutual friends at a party, the pair began chatting on MSN messenger and quickly grew close.

Chelsey said she felt the experience of being able to talk online made it easier for her to open up and have Matt get to know her true self beyond her birthmark.

Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare disorder present at birth. 

It's characterised by a port-wine stain on the face and brain or eye abnormalities.

While some children don't have any neurological symptoms of the disorder, others have severe developmental delays and seizures.

The disorder is not believed to be genetically inherited.

Experts instead believe it is caused by a network of blood vessels that continues to develop instead of separating. 

The total number of people with Sturge-Weber syndrome is unknown since many never receive a diagnosis. Estimates range between one in 40,000 and one in 400,000. 

Treatment depends on the type of symptoms the child may be experiencing. 

It may consist of medications to treat seizures, surgery to treat eye problems, or therapy to treat developmental delays.

She said: 'Matt was friends with a friend of mine. One day he was hanging out with her and we just connected.

'We got to chatting online and would talk for hours. I felt like he got to know the real me.

'If I try and speak with people in real life, all they can focus on is the birthmark. I feel like a bit of a monster that way.

'The next thing I know he asked me on a date, we went to the park, and then on another date to the mall.

'It was a big deal for anyone to be interested in me at the time, I never thought that was even possible.

'I never thought I would have a husband or kids because of how I looked.

'But we fell in love, and he loved me for me. He didn't care about my birthmark.'

Chelsey said that while she is used to being 'gawked' at while out in public, the stares are amplified while she is out with her husband and children.

She said: 'Matt says the hardest part about this relationship is the reaction of other people around us.

'We have to deal with a lot of staring. I am so used to it, but for him it's still a struggle.

'I was so nervous meeting his parents, but his family accepted me right away.

'I taught my girls from a young age about my birthmark, but to them it is just part of me and who I am.'

Chelsey said she never lets the stares or comments hurt her, and instead uses such incidents as an opportunity to educate.

Now feeling at peace with herself, the mom is sharing her story to raise awareness of her condition and to inspire others to accept people with facial differences.

She said: 'I wish people knew we are not contagious, which is one of the biggest misconceptions.

'Accept us and love us for who we are, birthmarks and all.

'We are incredible people, but we don't get to use our full potential because the outside world is not comfortable with us because we are such oddities.

'I want to be treated like any other woman in 2020.'
