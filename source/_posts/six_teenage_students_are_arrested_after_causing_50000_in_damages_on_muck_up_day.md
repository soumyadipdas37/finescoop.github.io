The older student was granted conditional bail and will appear in Fairfield Local Court on October 12.

The five younger students were granted conditional bail and will appear in a children's court on November 2.

Police Minister David Elliott slammed Muck Up day, saying it was not an excuse for alleged criminal behaviour.

'Kids that aren't going to comply with the law will be dealt with both by, I expect, the schools, but certainly by police,' he said on Saturday, according to 7 News.

'Mucking up because it's your last day of school is going to be no excuse when you're before the magistrate.'

Police investigations are ongoing.
