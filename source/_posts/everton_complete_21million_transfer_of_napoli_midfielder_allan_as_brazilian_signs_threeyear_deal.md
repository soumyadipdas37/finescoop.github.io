Everton have completed the signing of Napoli midfielder Allan for a £21million fee. 

The 29-year-old Brazilian moves to Goodison Park on a three-year deal as he links up with Carlo Ancelotti's Toffees ahead of the new Premier League season next week. 

Allan praised both Everton and Ancelotti's stature as he put pen to paper at his new club.

He told the official Everton website: 'It is a real pleasure to sign for Everton. I am immensely happy to be here. 

'I hope, like I have done in my entire career, I contribute with my performances together with my teammates and that I put in some great games, great performances and win important things.

'It is a club with a rich history in the Premier League, has real ambition and then there is Professor Ancelotti. He has done everything possible to bring me here.

'It is the size of the Club and the name of the coach which means you don't think twice about coming to Everton.'

The midfielder worked with Ancelotti while the Italian coach was the Napoli manager for 18 months between 2018 and 2019.

And Allan gave Everton fans an indication of what they can expect to see from the midfielder over the coming season. 

'A strong part of my game is marking and the desire going in to win absolutely every ball.

'I believe with my desire I can put in really good performances to win the fans over and I hope to win things as well. There will be a tremendous amount of dedication from me, a lot of dedication – a lot.

'I received a lot of messages from Everton fans and that made me really happy and confident in the work I can do here.' 

The Brazil international had been at Napoli since 2015 and has made 212 appearances in all competitions.

Allan was part of the side that won this season's Coppa Italia, as Genarro Gattuso's side beat Italian league champions Juventus on penalties in the final.

Meanwhile, Ancelotti is looking to finalise a deal for another former player in James Rodriguez. 

The Colombia international was part of Ancelotti's Real Madrid side in the 2014-15 season and is looking to bring the 29-year-old on an initial loan deal.  Ancelotti also brought James to former club Bayern Munich on temporary deal in 2017. 

The Toffees are also believed to be close to securing a £22million deal for Watford midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure.
