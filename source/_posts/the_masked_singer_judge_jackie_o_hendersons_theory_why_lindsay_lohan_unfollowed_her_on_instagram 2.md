Jackie 'O' Henderson has offered a compelling theory as to why Lindsay Lohan unfollowed all of The Masked Singer judges on Instagram.

The American actress, 34, severed social media ties with her former co-judges after she was replaced by Urzila Carlson when she couldn't fly back to Australia to film for the show due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. 

Jackie said on her KIIS FM breakfast show that she believes The Parent Trap star took the drastic measure because she didn't want to be 'constantly reminded of the job she really wanted but couldn't have.'

Interesting! Jackie 'O' Henderson has offered a compelling theory as to why Lindsay Lohan unfollowed all of The Masked Singer judges on Instagram

Jackie was pressed on the awkward situation by her co-host Kyle Sandilands as they spoke to Urzila at the other end of the line.

She responded: 'I have a theory behind this because Lindsay has still reached out on Whatsapp just to check in and see how everything's going.

'I think the reason she might have unfollowed us is that she doesn't want to see all The Masked Singer stuff because she really did want to be a part of it.'

Adding that the actress should have 'muted' the judges on social media instead, Jackie continued: 'I don't blame her in a way.

'I don't blame her': Jackie revealed on the KIIS FM breakfast show that she believes the Parent Trap star took the drastic measure because she didn't want to be 'constantly reminded of the job she really wanted but couldn't have'

'You don't want to be constantly reminded of the job you want to do, but can't do right now because of COVID.

'I'm assuming that's why and not because there's any other reason,' she added.

Jackie also said that she hadn't discussed the matter with her fellow judges Dannii Minogue and Dave Hughes, who also received the same treatment by Lindsay.

All good: Jackie admitted Lindsay's unfollowing couldn't have been anything dramatic because she recently 'reached out on Whatsapp just to check in and see how everything's going'

Meanwhile, Jackie recently told Who magazine that Lindsay was 'so upset' over being unable to return to Australia to film the second season.

'We've stayed in touch after she was on the panel last year. She's so upset that she couldn't make it back to Australia, but it just wasn't possible,' Jackie said.

'I know she'll try and watch it from her home. I loved what she brought to the show last year.'
