Prince Edward has stepped out in a plastic face shield for a visit to Surrey as research emerged suggesting they don't work in stopping the spread of COVID-19.

The Earl of Wessex, 56, who lives with his wife Sophie, 55, and their children Lady Louise Windsor, 16, and James Viscount Severn, 12, at Bagshot Park, between Windsor and Guildford, visited Yvonne Arnaud Theatre yesterday.

His engagement came as a study warned that plastic face shields allow nearly 100 per cent of tiny airborne droplets released by coronavirus-infected patients to escape through visors.

Dressed in a grey blazer, teamed with cream trousers and a blue shirt, the Queen's son shielded his face with a plastic guard.

Photographs of the royal, who followed social distancing rules during his visit, were shared to the Royal Family's Twitter account today. 

Edward could be seen chatting with actors and staff members at the Guildford theatre before exploring the gardens, which is being used as an outdoor stage.

The images were captioned: 'The Earl of Wessex yesterday visited the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford, where he met with actors and staff to discuss how the arts are coping with Covid-19 restrictions.

'The theatre is one of the few venues staging indoor performances, with reduced audience numbers. The Earl has long-supported the arts, and is Patron of many organisations that support youth participation in theatre, music and dance.

Yesterday, a study warned that plastic face shields allow nearly 100 per cent of tiny airborne droplets released by coronavirus-infected patients to escape through visors.

The alternative to face masks were touted by industry experts as providing adequate protection from the virus - and the British government has recommended them for hairdressers, barbers, nail technicians and tattooists as a barrier between them and the customer. 

But doubt has now been cast on claims they work, after a computer simulation revealed almost 100 per cent of airborne droplets smaller than five micrometres in size — released when talking and breathing — escaped through the visor.

And half of larger droplets measuring 50 micrometres in size — given off by coughs and sneezes — found their way into the air, posing a risk to others. One micrometre is one millionth of a metre.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says face shields can help prevent the virus, scientifically called SARS-CoV-2.

But the agency says they only work in combination with other safety measures such as wearing a mask, social distancing, and frequent hand-washing.

Face shields do not completely cover the entirety of the face, leaving room for droplets expelled by the mouth and nose to escape.

Face visors are also worn by doctors, nurses and other hospital workers on the Covid-19 frontline, but with the addition of a fitted surgical face mask. 

Makoto Tsubokura, team leader of the study carried out by the Riken Centre in Japan, cautioned against wearing face visors.

He told The Guardian: 'Judging from the results of the simulation, unfortunately the effectiveness of face guards in preventing droplets from spreading from an infected person's mouth is limited compared with masks.'

In a scramble to find ways to protect people from catching the coronavirus, masks, goggles, visors and gloves have all been touted as possible layers of protection.

Some people have even been seen with homemade attempts, such as wearing lunchboxes or water bottles over their faces.

But do visors work?

Some research has shown that people are at risk of becoming more seriously ill with COVID-19 if they receive a larger 'viral load' - the first dose of viruses that they are infected with.

Epidemiologist Dr Eli Perencevich and a team of scientists at the University of Iowa said a visor could reduce the amount of virus someone inhaled by up to 92 per cent form 2m away from the source.

They said: 'Face shields... should be included as part of strategies to safely and significantly reduce transmission in the community setting.'

Dr Robert Glatter, a doctor at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said that early data was 'promising'.

But research carried out before the pandemic does not show any clear benefits of using visors on their own, other scientists say.

A study by the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) done in 2016 found there is no proof to back up claims that face shields work on their own.

He said viruses or bacteria could come in through around the edges of the visor and still cause infection — and said they should only be used in addition to other PPE.

Lawrence Young, a virologist and oncologist, University of Warwick, told MailOnline: 'I don’t know of any systematic studies properly evaluating the benefits of face shields.'

He noted an 'interesting' review led by the University of Hong which comprehensively explored the different types of facial protection measures, including masks.

The team highlighted the fact that ‘strong evidence is lacking in terms of the effectiveness of face shields against the transmission of viral respiratory diseases'.

Writing in the journal Oral Diseases, the team add: 'Because most face shields do not form a tight seal around the side of the face and chin area, they do not offer protection against aerosols leaking in from the margins of the face shields.'
