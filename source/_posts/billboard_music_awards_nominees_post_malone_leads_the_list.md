Post Malone leads the 2020 Billboard Music Awards nominations with 16.

The 25-year-old singer has been shortlisted for 15 different awards, with two of his nods being in the Top Rap Song category, one for Sunflower (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) - on which he collaborated with Swae Lee, and again for Wow.

Post's nominations also include the prestigious Top Artist award, which he will contest against Billie Eilish and Khalid - who both received 12 nominations - as well as Jonas Brothers and Taylor Swift.

Tops: Post Malone leads the 2020 Billboard Music Awards nominations with 16. The 25-year-old singer has been shortlisted for 15 different awards, with two of his nods being in the Top Rap Song category, one for 'Sunflower (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse') - on which he collaborated with Swae Lee, and again for 'Wow'; seen in December 

Lil Nas X follows him with 13 nominations, including in the Top Male Artist category, for which Post is also shortlisted along with DaBaby, Khalid, and Ed Sheeran.

Top Female Artist will be contested by Billie, Taylor, Ariana Grande, Lizzo and Halsey, and BTS, Dan + Shay, Jonas Brothers, Maroon 5 and Panic! At The Disco will fight it out for Top Duo/Group.

The prestigious Top Billboard 200 Album accolade will go to either Billie for 'When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?', Ariana for 'Thank U, Next', 'Free Spirit' by Khalid, Post's 'Hollywood's Bleeding' or Taylor's 'Lover'.

And in the Top 100 Song category, Lil Nas X's smash collaboration with Billy Ray Cyrus, 'Old Town Road', is in contention, along with Lewis Capaldi's 'Someone You Loved', Billie's 'bad guy', Lizzo's 'Truth Hurts' and Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello's 'Senorita'.

Elsewhere, while Kanye West has previously been recognized in the rap categories, this year he's shortlisted for Top Gospel and Top Christian Artist, with his Sunday Service Choir also up for the former.

He's also got an impressive four nods in the Top Gospel Song category for his tracks 'Closed on Sunday', 'Follow God' - which is also up for Top Christian Song - 'On God' and 'Selah', with Kirk Franklin's 'Love Theory' rounding out the category

And the 'Bound 2' hitmaker is also up for both Top Christian Album and Top Gospel Album for his 'Jesus Is King' record.

The Billboard Music Awards usually take place in May each year but were postponed in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

They will now take place on 14 October, with Kelly Clarkson returning as host. 

She has had a very good year: Billie Eilish has also been nominated for a Billboard Award; seen in August 

The nominees are based on the original eligibility period between March 23, 2019, and March 14, 2020. 

The awards show was originally scheduled for April 29, 2020, but was postponed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  

Billboard Music Awards nominees and winners are based on 'key fan interactions with music, including album and digital song sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring and social engagement, tracked by Billboard and its data partners, including MRC Data/Nielsen Music,' according to a press release.

The 2020 Billboard Music Awards is produced by dick clark productions. Amy Thurlow, Mark Bracco, Barry Adelman, Linda Gierahn, Kelly Clarkson and Robert Deaton are executive producers.
