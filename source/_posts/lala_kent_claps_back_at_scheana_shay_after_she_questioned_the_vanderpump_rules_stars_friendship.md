Lala Kent hit back at Scheana Shay after her Vanderpump Rules co-star questioned their friendship.

The 30-year took to her Instagram story on Saturday to clear the air, after Shay revealed on her Scheananigans With Scheana Shay that Kent promised Shay's mother that she would look after her.

'She literally said to my mom, ‘If she needs anything at all, I will be there. I’m five minutes away in Palm Springs,' Shay said on the podcast. 'I needed her and she wasn’t there because she had dinner with celebrities. Let’s be real.'

In response, Kent took to her Instagram story with a lengthy message to offer her thoughts on Shay's comments.   

'Anybody wondering my thoughts on @scheana ‘dragging’ me,' Kent, who hosts her own podcast Give Them Lala with fiancee Randall Emmett. 

'1. I’m not trippin too hard. In her mind that’s how it happened. She would rather focus on me ‘not being there for her’ than the fact her man said he was working, turned his phone off and went golfing that day,' she said.

'Weird how that was just glazed over. This is why her relationships are always a trainwreck that make epic TV. She makes reality TV gold,' Kent added.

'2. She claims I chose celebrity over her. Girl, weren’t you just capitalizing off banging John Mayer 100 years ago?' Kent added, throwing some major shade.

'3. She has a way of making everything about her. I’ve accepted that about her and found the endearing parts of it,' she added.

'4. She has an idea of how everyone should react in certain situations. We usually always fail and she is left disappointed. This is why she has a new best friend every day. We can’t keep up,' Kent added.

'5. When she told me she was really upset with Brock and just wanted to go to bed, I didn't know that meant, "Come over right now."

She concluded her missive with, 'I can’t believe I just gave that much time to this s–t when we aren’t even filming and I’m not getting paid. Smh.'

Shay also said during the podcast that her and boyfriend Brock Davies weren't invited to the gender reveal party Kent and Emmett threw recently.

Kent and Emmett announced earlier this month they are expecting their first child, with the gender reveal party on September 19 revealing they're expecting a girl.

It hasn't been revealed yet when Kent's first child will be due.
