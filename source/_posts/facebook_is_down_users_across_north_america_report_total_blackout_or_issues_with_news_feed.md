If you are experiencing a total Facebook blackout- you are not alone.

The social media platform is experiencing an outage across North America, with major cities such as Chicago and Boston in the US, along with Montreal in Canada, Mexico City to the south and parts of South America.

Issue reports began to slow trickle in to DownDetector.com around 4pm ET with users citing problems with News Feed, logging in or accessing the platform entirely.

Both the app and desktop site seem to be experiencing glitches, with more than 11,000 users plagued with issues.

Â DownDetector, which monitors service of online platforms, showed issue reports starting at 3:40pm ET with 36 complaints and quickly spiked to more than 11,000.

The largest problem plaguing users seems to be a total blackout.

Users are being shown a blank page with a wrench in the center and text underneath that reads: 'This Page Isn't Available Right Now.'

'This may be because of a technical error that we're working on to fix. Try reloading this page.'

However, the users have been reloading over and over again without any success.
