Bella Varelis got into a heated argument with best friend Irena Srbinovksa during Thursday's episode of The Bachelor.

After weeks of tension, Irena, 31, pulled Bella aside for a private conversation to see if they could resolve their differences.

But it didn't take long for things to escalate, with Bella, 25, labelling Irena 'a manipulative little b***h', before storming off.

And the show's fans appeared just as stunned as Irena, processing Bella's seemingly uncharacteristic meltdown on Twitter.

'Jeez, I thought Bella was a Disney Princess, I guess not,' tweeted one shocked fan, while another added, 'First time I haven't liked Bella. Overreaction much? Irena's taking over as No. 1'.

Others compared Bella to fellow contender Roxi Kenny, who quickly developed a reputation as the show's resident drama queen.
