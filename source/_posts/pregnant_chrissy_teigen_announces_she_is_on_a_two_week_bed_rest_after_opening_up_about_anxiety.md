Pregnant Chrissy Teigen announced she is on an 'official' two week bed rest, after admitting she often finds herself 'freaking out' when she can't feel her baby kicking.

The 34-year-old model, who is expecting her third child with husband John Legend, opened up to fans about resting at home and restricting some of her activities. 

'I’m on official 2 week bed rest :( I’m taking this time to learn how to sew capes and kid clothes so shit is about to get... astonishingly ugly,' she tweeted on Tuesday night.

In addition to honing her new hobby, the cookbook writer revealed her pregnancy cravings have caused her to yearn for 'sandwiches all the time.'

She joked: 'If I’m not making, I’m ordering. If not ordering, looking at pics of them. If not looking at pics, I’m learning about new mayos. I had to cancel therapy because I didn’t wanna not think about sammies for 60 mins.' 

Her tweets come one day after sharing a sweet video on Instagram of her daughter Luna, four, helping out with a sonogram.

The star's firstborn child helped guide the doctor's hand over her mother's stomach and called out excitedly when the fetus came into view on the monitor.

In the caption alongside the clip, the Chrissy's Court star admitted to feeling nervous in these relatively early days of her pregnancy.

'Before I’m able to start feeling the kicks, the anxiety gets the best of me and any little bits of spotting or pain freak me ouuuuuut,' she wrote.

Teigen, who is also a mom to her two-year-old son Miles, concluded her update by saying 'all is well' and has yet to specify why she is on bed rest.  

Earlier this week, she also opened up to Marie Claire's Fall 2020 issue, which goes on newsstands September 10, about starting therapy while under quarantine. 

'People think I'm tough, but I'm such an empath, and I take on other people's pain and sadness as my own. And when I let people down, I'm hyperaware of it,' the confessed. 'Sometimes I feel like people aren't going to be as hard on me as I am on myself.'

She added: 'I'm barely online anymore, and that was at the request of my therapist.'  

'I didn't start therapy until quarantine. I used to avoid it and make fun of the idea of it, and then I found the person and it changed my world,' admitted the supermodel.

The lifestyle entrepreneur and her Grammy-winning husband, 41, announced they were expecting their third child in the music video for his latest single, Wild, last month.
