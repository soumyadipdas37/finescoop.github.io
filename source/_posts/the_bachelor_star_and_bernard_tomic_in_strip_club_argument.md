Troubled Australian tennis star Bernard Tomic and The Bachelor contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe had a very public row inside strip club last weekend, it can now be revealed.

Tomic, 27, and Hoppe, 26, were seen arguing inside Hollywood Showgirls strip club during a big night out on the Gold Coast on Saturday, September 5.

The argument led to Ms Hoppe leaving the club, while Tomic - a regular patron - was allowed to stay.

It is understood the pair have been in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years, which recommenced after Ms Hoppe was kicked off The Bachelor.

Ms Hoppe refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.

'It was crazy, even for a night out on the Gold Coast. They were screaming at each other,' one man told Daily Mail Australia (Pictured is Ms Hoppe outside the strip club with a friend)

A source told Daily Mail Australia the altercation brought the club to a standstill.

'They got in a big fight at Hollywood Showgirls the other weekend... everyone heard and saw it,' the man said.

'It was crazy, even for a night out on the Gold Coast. They were screaming at each other.'

Having long been dubbed the brightest future star in world tennis, Tomic's career is almost at a point of no return.

Tomic, the former world number 17, has not played a professional match since March and has not won a Grand Slam match since mid-2018

The world number 209 has not won a Grand Slam singles match since mid-2018.

The former Wimbledon quarter finalist was such a prodigious young talent that at 12 he was signed by management giant IMG.

But after reaching a highest ranking of 17 in 2016, Tomic's career has been downhill ever since and marred by a number of incidents both off and on the court.

His altercation with Ms Hoppe came just a day after two AFL players were kicked out of the league's COVID-19 hub for a brawl outside the same strip club.

Sydney Stack and Callum Coleman-Jones were sitting on a bench outside the venue eating kebabs in the early hours of September 4 when a man confronted them.

CCTV showed the man being knocked to the ground in the push and shove.

Stack, 20, and Coleman-Jones, 21, were both suspended for the remainder of 2020.
