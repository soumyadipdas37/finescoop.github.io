Despite emerging as the star in Amazon's hit Tottenham documentary 'All or Nothing,' Jose Mourinho insists he has only 'seen bits' of the recently broadcast show.

Mourinho is often regarded as a proud and somewhat self-absorbed individual, but the iconic Portuguese manager says he has not put much time aside to watch himself in the show.

In the series fans are offered a glimpse of Mourinho as never seen before, which has seen the Portuguese commended for opening himself up. The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss has, however, revealed there were certain filming requests he turned down.

Speaking ahead of Tottenham's season-opening clash with Everton, Mourinho told reporters: 'I've seen bits of it. People will get a different image of the players. This can confirm that it is a problem for players when they lose. 

'Everything related to my job, is something that I love. I don't see myself doing something else in life.'

Many viewers have credited the way Spurs allowed the cameras to observe deep into the inner core of the squad, with a constant watch on training sessions and the dressing room itself.

Mourinho however has revealed that he did put certain guidelines in place, despite appearing very accommodating in the series and opening himself up. 

'The challenge is trying to be happy, happy, happy. I agreed with them [Amazon] not to show my tactical work!' Mourinho added.

'To get a job mid season is very, very difficult. For me to arrive and change is not the right thing. The best thing was to diagnose the situation. The problems were the results. 

'The away record was really bad. The number of goals conceded were really bad. The injuries were such an unlucky situation. It was really complicated, it was hard.'

Danny Rose's feisty conversation with Mourinho during the January window was a highlight

Last season Mourinho was unable to secure a top four finish with Tottenham, despite the season's postponement due to the coronavirus pandemic enabling several injured players to return in time to finish the campaign.

This season Mourinho is bidding to get Spurs back among the big time, despite an apparent lack of funds in the transfer window.

So far the north London club have brought in Matt Doherty of Wolves, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg from Southampton and Joe Hart as a free agent.
