Tributes have poured in for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg from both sides of the political line with Hillary Clinton saying she 'paved the way for so many women' and former President George Bush remembering the 'smart and humorous trailblazer'. 

 Ginsburg, only the second woman to serve as a Supreme Court Justice, died Friday evening aged 87 after a battle with metastatic pancreas cancer, the Supreme Court announced. 

The judge, who served for 27 years on the highest court of the land, passed away surrounded by her family at her home in Washington D.C. following complications after she has battled the disease on and off since 2009.

Chief Justice John Roberts led tributes to his colleague Friday describing her as a 'champion of justice'.

'Our nation has lost a justice of historic stature,' Roberts said in a statement. 

'We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her, a tired and resolute champion of justice.'  

Tributes poured in from former presidents including George Bush and Jimmy Carter and several Democrats including Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Hillary Clinton tweeted that Ginsburg, a staunch advocate for women's rights, paved the way for other women. 

'Justice Ginsburg paved the way for so many women, including me. There will never be another like her. Thank you RBG,' Clinton wrote. 

Bernie Sanders called her passing a 'tremendous loss' to America. 

'Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of the great justices in modern American history and her passing is a tremendous loss to our country,' he tweeted. 

'She will be remembered as an extraordinary champion of justice and equal rights.'

Former president George Bush also paid tribute to Ginsburg in a statement Friday. 

'Laura and I join our fellow Americans in mourning the loss of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She dedicated many of her 87 remarkable years to the pursuit of justice and equality, and she inspired more than one generation of women and girls,' he said.

'Justice Ginsburg loved our country and the law. Laura and I are fortunate to have known this smart and humorous trailblazer, and we send our condolences to the Ginsburg family'. 

Former president Jimmy Carter also paid tribute to the 'powerful legal mind and a staunch advocate for gender equality'.

'Rosalynn and I are saddened by the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. A powerful legal mind and a staunch advocate for gender equality, she has been a beacon of justice during her long and remarkable career,' he said in a statement.

'I was proud to have appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1980. We join countless Americans in mourning the loss of a truly great woman.

'We will keep her family in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.' 

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke of the state's heartbreak over the loss over one of its own.









Tributes poured in from Democrats including Hillary Clinton, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Washington Governor Jay Inslee

'NY's heart breaks with the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,' the Democrat tweeted.

'During her extraordinary career, this Brooklyn native broke barriers & the letters RBG took on new meaning—as battle cry & inspiration. Her legal mind & dedication to justice leave an indelible mark on America.'

Washington Governor Jay Inslee, also a Democrat, described her as an 'American hero' and demanded that her 'dying wish' to not be replaced on the bench until after the election be respected.

He tweeted: 'We have lost an American hero and a giant of justice. 

'May we honor Justice Ginsburg's legacy by fighting for the civil rights of all Americans and respect her dying wish that she 'will not be replaced until a new president is installed.''

 

Former presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter also paid tribute to the legal pioneer Friday

His words were echoed by Senator Cory Booker who urged the nation to carry on 'her legacy of fairness and equality'.

'Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a true giant, an American hero and a warrior for justice,' Booker tweeted.

'Our country mourns her loss deeply—we must honor her by carrying on her legacy of fairness and equality.'

Tributes also poured in from those on the other side of the political spectrum.  

Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted that he was filled with 'great sadness' at the news and that despite their 'many differences' he 'appreciate[d] her service to our nation'.

'It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Justice Ginsburg. Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes. She served with honor and distinction as a member of the Supreme Court,' he wrote. 





Tributes also poured in from those on the other side of the political spectrum

'While I had many differences with her on legal philosophy, I appreciate her service to our nation. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends. May she Rest In Peace.' 

President Trump is yet to tweet about her passing however estranged niece Mary Trump urged Americans to continue her 'fight for our country'.

'Take a moment. Breathe. And then we fight for our country the way she always did for us. Or we will lose everything,' she wrote on Twitter. 

Ginsburg's death gives Trump the opportunity to name her successor at a critical time just six weeks before the nation heads to the polls.

The president has already appointed two members of the Supreme Court, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, in a move that pushes the court increasingly right wing.

The replacement of Ginsburg, a Democrat and women's rights champion, by another Republican will leave the court Democrats outnumbered, with six Republicans to their three.

A debate is expected to ensue over whether Trump should nominate her successor or leave the seat vacant until after the outcome of the election. 

Senator Chuck Schumer tweeted Friday after the news broke of Ginsburg's death that the position should not be filled until the White House race was over.

'The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,' he tweeted.

'Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.'

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying the Senate and nation mourns for Ginsburg alongside a statement where he said Trump's nominee would be voted for by the Senate. 

'The Senate and the nation mourn the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life,' he tweeted. 

Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Clinton in 1993 and has served more than 27 years. 

She leaves behind her two children Jane Carol Ginsburg and James Steven Ginsburg, four grandchildren Paul Spera, Clara Spera, Miranda Ginsburg and Abigail Ginsburg, two step-grandchildren Harjinder Bedi and Satinder Bedi, and one great-grandchild Lucrezia Spera. 

Her husband Martin David Ginsburg died in 2010. 

Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on March 15 1933.
