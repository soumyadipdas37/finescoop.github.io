She announced she was expecting her second child with South Sydney Rabbitohs prop Tom Burgess less than two months ago,

And Tahlia Giumelli showed off her burgeoning baby bump on Monday while heading to a CPR course in Cronulla, in Sydney's south.

The pregnant WAG, 28, was dressed casually in a pair of olive green leggings, which she paired with a matching sweatshirt.

Her jumper hugged the model's burgeoning belly as she arrived at her appointment.

Tahlia, who is in her third trimester, completed her sporty look with a pair of black sneakers, and carried a black YSL handbag on one shoulder.

Her long, caramel-coloured hair was tied up in a high ponytail, and she didn't appear to be wearing any makeup.

Tom and Tahlia, who are already parents to one-year-old daughter Sophie, announced on Instagram in early August they were expecting their second child.

'Only a few months away from Sophie meeting her little brother or sister. Can't wait to have a new addition join the family before the year is out,' Tahlia captioned a photo of her young daughter touching her baby bump.

Meanwhile, Tom, 28, said they were waiting until the birth to find out the baby's gender, but invited fans to try and guess.

'Yes we'll be adding one more of these cheeky cherubs to our family before the end of the year!' the English rugby league star wrote. 

'We can't wait for our new arrival, Tahlia is doing the best job once again at pregnancy, this time there is no gender reveal!
