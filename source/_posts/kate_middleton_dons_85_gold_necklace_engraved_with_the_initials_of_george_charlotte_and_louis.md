Kate Middleton paid a touching tribute to her children by donning a necklace complete with their initials as she met with fellow parents in a park yesterday. 

The Duchess of Cambridge, 38, opted for personalised gold necklace from Welsh designer Hayley Jones, engraved with the letters 'G, L, C' in honour of her children, Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five, and Prince Louis, two for the outing in Battersea Park.

The mother-of-three paired the delicate pendant with another £85 gold necklace from Hayley's brand Spells of Love, a simple white t-shirt, and rewore her pair of £29 M&S pink trousers as she met with fellow mothers to discuss the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

And it's not the first time the duchess has opted to keep her children close to her heart.

Earlier this year, the royal wore a delicate £1,070 'Personalised Gold Midnight Moon Necklace' by Daniella Draper, which was engraved with the letters 'G, L, C' in honour of her children during her 24 hour three-leg trip around Britain to launch a landmark survey on early childhood development.

And back in February 2014, she was photographed proudly wearing a new necklace that carried a disc engraved with Prince George’s full name – George Alexander Louis – and a heart-shaped charm inscribed with the letter ‘W’ for her husband William. 

Alongside her personalised necklace, the Duchess wore the £85 Spells of Love Double Strand Beaded Satellite Chain Necklace.

The brand is described online as crafting pieces with a mix of 'bohemian feminine influence' and 'trend-led modern aesthetic', with a focus on 'ethical production'. 

The Duchess opted for the gold stacked necklaces as she stepped out in Battersea Park yesterday 

It was launched in August 2019, and has since become a favourite for British reality stars and models including Emma Louise Connelly, MIC's Sophie Habbo and TOWIE's Chloe Lewis.

The pieces are described as being 'designed with love and intention' and 'mix bohemian feminine influence with trend led and modern aesthetic'.

She added a further touch of glamour with her £110 Halcyon Days Maya Torque bangle and her £385 Daniella Draper Cupid hoop earrings. 

The Duchess is known for her love of affordable jewellery, and often selects earrings by high street brands including Accessorize.  

Earlier this year, Kate  donned a gold necklace featuring a pendant engraved the with initials of her children as she stepped out in Cardiff today 

 The duchess was greeted in the autumn sunshine in the picturesque Old English Garden in Battersea Park where she spoke with the mothers, whose children were in pushchairs, as they sat socially distanced on wooden park benches yesterday.

The mother-of-three chatted with parents helped by different peer groups - such as Home-Start, National Childbirth Trust (NCT) and Mush - and heard how they had struggled to meet up during the Covid-19 lockdown, but kept up their work on zoom and regular phone calls.  

The personal style of necklace is also loved by Meghan Markle, who wore a dainty initial 'A' necklace as a nod to her then two-month-old son Archie when she made a surprise appearance at Wimbledon in July 2019. 

In September last year, the Duchess of Sussex also kept husband Prince Harry and baby Archie close-by during her first trip away from her family when she arrived in New York.

Meghan Markle was seen wearing a gold necklace embellished with the initials 'H' and 'A' in honour of Prince Harry, 35, and their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, then four months, during her first solo trip since becoming a mother in September 2019

The mother-of-one wore a gold necklace adorned with the letters 'H' and 'A' while watching her friend Serena Williams compete against Canadian Bianca Andreescu in the US tennis championship - and was pictured fiddling with her necklace as the game heated up.

In addition to the initials, the dainty piece of jewellery by brand Mini Mini, also featured two tiny diamonds, and retails at £125.

The royal was also photographed wearing a delicate 18-carat gold 'mommy' necklace when she was seven-months-pregnant, with many believing it could have been one of her baby shower gifts.

The handcrafted necklace doesn't come cheap, and retails at an eye-watering $850 (£650), by designer Jennifer Meyer - and it appeared the letter addition to her jewellery collection was from the same brand.
