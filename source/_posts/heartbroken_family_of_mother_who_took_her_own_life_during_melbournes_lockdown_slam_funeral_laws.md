A grief-stricken family has shared a heartbreaking photo showing an elderly widower sitting alone and away from loved ones at his wife's funeral during lockdown in  Melbourne.

Clare Ross disappeared from her home in Ferntree Gully in the city's south-east on August 30 before her body was found in a nearby quarry 24 hours later, three days before what would have been her 79th birthday.

Her devastated family have opened up to Daily Mail Australia about their heartbreak to raise awareness about suicide - and called for Victoria's strict rules on funerals to be overhauled in line with the rest of Australia.

Only 10 mourners could attend Ms Ross' funeral on Friday under Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown. 

It meant none of her 12 grandchildren or four great-grandchildren could say goodbye.

David Ross (pictured) was forced to sit on his own and socially distance from loved ones as he mourned the loss of his wife of 60 years Clare at her funeral in Melbourne on Friday

Her son Danny later uploaded the gut-wrenching photo of his father David, 82, sitting on his own on a church pew, unable to be comforted by loved ones as he mourned the loss of his wife of 60 years.

'I felt today's service being inside the church seemed cold and lonely,' Mr Ross captioned the photo on Facebook, which has since gone viral online.

'Whoever decided that only 10 people can attend a funeral in a 800 square metre church needs their heads read. Look at that picture and tell me it's right.'

'The most stupid thing is more than 100 people can shop in a supermarket at any one time.'

Ms Ross' tragic death has left the family reeling. They said they had no idea of her dark thoughts.

'It wasn't in her DNA, she was very old school and kept her feelings to herself but always warned us six kids against suicide, which was against her religion,' her son Danny told Daily Mail Australia.

'She was last person on earth I would think would take their own life. If I had any idea, we would have kept closer tabs on her. Everyone is devastated.'

Clare Ross took her own life, days before she was due to celebrate her 79th birthday

'She had a few niggling illnesses here and there and self-diagnosed herself with dementia.

'But as soon as COVID hit, that's when she started to go downhill. She was paranoid about it and tested negative four times.'

Ms Ross and her husband were hit hard when lockdown confined them to their house earlier this year. 

'My mum was a social butterfly before lockdown, always out with her church, her card group or volunteering,' Mr Ross said.

'She and Dad were out every day of the week and were never home. So lockdown has been a battle for them. At one stage, Mum described lockdown as being in prison.'

Danny Ross said his parents David and Clare (pictured together) have battled with being confined to their home during lockdown

Mr Ross' heartbreaking photo of his father at the funeral has gone viral with more than a thousand shares and comments.

In attendance with him were their six children and three of his late wife's siblings.

'Seriously, it was horrible,' her son told Daily Mail Australia.

'For us to not be able to go over and give him a hug while he's crying over the loss of Mum was devastating.

'I didn't want to make it political, but I have not had one negative comment on the post, which tells you something.

'But I don't want sympathy. I want the rules changed.'

Mr Ross has pleaded the Victorian government to increase the number of attendees allowed at funerals.

It comes after Premier Andrews announced on Saturday plans to ease restrictions on pet groomers, who can reopen on September 28.

Mr Ross described the current funeral limit of 10 in Victoria as 'inhumane'.

The limit has increased to 100 in New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland in recent months.

South Australia allows 150 at funerals while up to 250 Tasmanians can attend an indoor funeral, which increases to 500 for outdoors.

The only limit on funerals in Western Australia is the two-square metre per person rule. 

'It needs to change but sadly, I don't think it's going to as the Victorian government is hell bent on showing no compassion,' Mr Ross said.

'What they've done is wrong. We want this fixed so no other family goes through what we have.

'What if my parents had 10 kids? Who misses out, my dad?

'They need to change funerals before they look at other services such as pet groomers and hairdressers.

'People aren't stupid, they're going to be respectful, especially at a funeral.' 

Clare's tragic death has rocked her close-knit family, which includes six children, 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren

Mr Ross also wants to open up the discussion about suicide.

Victoria's lockdown has not yet seen a spike in suicides compared to last year, according to new data.

Since the start of this year, 466 people have taken their own lives in Victoria, compared to 468 suicides in the same time frame last year, according to figures recently released by the state coroner.

Mr Ross has questioned the figures.

'After Mum's body was found, the police said to us they've seen more suicides in the last six months than they had in the six years prior,' Mr Ross said.

'There are lots of what ifs and whys, because we'll never get the answers we are looking for. Suicide is a taboo subject and that needs to change.' 

As Stage Four lockdown continues for at least another two weeks, Mr Ross urged Melburnians to keep a vigilant on their elderly loved ones, regardless of the distance.

'If your elderly parents are still alive and you're not with them make sure you check in on them even if the rules don't allow it just do it. No amount of fines or laws should deter you from doing it,' he urged.
