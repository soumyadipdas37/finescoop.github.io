A father has been left paralysed after another man tried to kill him by running him down with his ute during an argument over missing meat. 

Darryl Dighton, 49, drove to James Tickle's property in Acacia Hills, in rural Darwin, to 'borrow' some meat for Australia Day on January 26. 

The pair were not known to each other, Mr Tickle was friend's with Dighton's wife.

When he got to the home at midday and found no one was home, Dighton decided to help himself to steak and sausages in the freezer before driving off. 

Darryl Dighton, 49, drove to James Tickle's property in Acacia Hills, in rural Darwin, to 'borrow' some meat for Australia Day on January 26

When he got to the home at midday and found no one was home, Dighton decided to help himself to steak and sausages in the freezer before driving off

He returned to the property after a few drinks with his mate to let Mr Tickle know what he'd done. 

But still no one was home, so he left once more, driving off in his Nissan Navara, leaving behind skid marks on his way.

Dighton's wife then began getting messages calling her husband a 'grub' and challenging him to return to the property to face up to what he'd done. 

On arrival he found Mr Tickle standing on the side of the road with a metal pole and wooden club.

Dighton yelled for Mr Tickle to drop his weapons and 'fight like a man' as he approached him. 

Mr Tickle then swung the club, hitting Dighton several times on the head.

'He just hit me with a stick, jump into the vehicle and I'll drive over the c***,' Dighton yelled as he ran back to his ute.

Dighton bowled Mr Tickle over with his ute before driving over him several times. 

Dighton appeared in the the Supreme Court this week where he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and attempted murder

Mr Tickle was flown to Adelaide to with 'catastrophic injuries'. He has likely permanently lost the use of his legs.

Dighton appeared in the the Supreme Court this week where he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and attempted murder.

Dighton's barrister, Peter Maley, told the court his client had very little memory of the 'showdown'.

'(He) was emotional and couldn't believe what he did, and he said, in fairness, ''I deserve to be punished'',' Mr Maley said. 

The matter will return to court on November 6 for sentencing.
