Eddie Murphy won his first-ever Emmy on the fifth and final night of the virtual 2020 Creative Arts Emmy Awards on Saturday. 

The legendary actor and comedian, 59, took home the award for Outstanding Guest Actor In A Comedy Series for his hosting spot on Saturday Night Live last December. 

Murphy had some stiff competition in the category: beating out Brad Pitt and Adam Driver who were also up for SNL roles, Fred Willard in Modern Family (in a posthumous nomination), Dev Patel in Modern Love and Luke Kirby for his role as Lenny Bruce on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

Finally! Eddie Murphy won his first-ever Emmy for his Saturday Night Live hosting gig during Saturday's virtual 2020 Creative Arts Emmy Awards on Saturday

Murphy wasn't available to accept his Emmy during on the virtual Creative Emmys FXX telecast. 

His guest starring episode marked the show's highest ratings in over two years. 

His return to Saturday Night Live as host was his first appearance on the longtime NBC sketch comedy in 35 years.

Legendary: Murphy, 59, brought back some of his most famous characters when he hosted SNL in December 2019

Long wait: Murphy's SNL appearance was his first since leaving the show as a regular in 1984

The Brooklyn, New York native joined the SNL cast for season six in 1980 when he was just 19-years-old, and lasted until his departure in 1984.

His run on SNL helped launch his meteoric rise as a stand-up comedian and A-list leading man in such films as 48 Hours, Trading Places, the Beverly Hills Cop franchise, The Nutty Professor, Dreamgirls, the Shrek franchise, Dr. Doolittle and Dolemite Is My Name, among others.

Murphy had previous been nominated for four Emmys over the years which included Outstanding Supporting Actor In A Comedy, Variety, Or Music series for SNL in 1983; both Outstanding Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program and Outstanding Writing For A Variety Series for SNL in 1984; and Outstanding Animated Programming, Hour Or Less for The PJs in 1999.

The night's event also crowned Maya Rudolph a two-time Emmy winner.

Earlier this week the Florida native won an Emmy for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance for her role as Connie The Hormone Monstress on Netflix’s animated series Big Mouth.
