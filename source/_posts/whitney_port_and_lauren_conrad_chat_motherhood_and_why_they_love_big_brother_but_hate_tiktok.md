Whitney Port continued her discussion with her former castmate Lauren Conrad in part two of her With Whit podcast posted on Tuesday.

35-year-old Whitney and 34-year-old Lauren appeared together on MTV's The Hills for four seasons and five seasons, respectively, of the six-season Laguna Beach spin-off famed for fabricating storylines.

'Their job was to, like, make things out of nothing and make us think things that were not actually happening,' Port noted.

Famed for fabricating storylines: 35-year-old Whitney (M) and 34-year-old Lauren (L) appeared together on MTV's The Hills for four seasons and five seasons, respectively, of the six-season Laguna Beach spin-off (pictured in 2006) 

'And I feel that had an affect on me trusting other people.'

Conrad admitted she initially agreed to shoot The Hills in 2006 because she 'was broke' and starring in MTV's Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County was 'the easiest money I ever made.'

'Most of the people that I [keep in touch] with are from Laguna. So Dieter [Schmitz] I talk to all the time. I don't see anybody anymore but when I did, I see Stephen [Colletti] like at holidays and stuff and I'll usually see like Christina Schuller,' the Laguna Beach native revealed.

'Because, obviously, I live in my hometown, it's more seeing people that I grew up with who I also filmed a show with. For me, especially now, being married with kids it's really important that I'm in a good place. My happiness is my family's happiness. It's all a balance.'

The blonde twosome might have had mixed feelings about the stigma of being a reality star, but they certainly both enjoy watching Big Brother.

'Oh yeah, my husband and I are like big Big Brother people. Last summer, we went to like the live taping,' Lauren laughed.

'We nerd out, we do the after hours, we do the podcast and the blogs. Like, we're invested. I have a Big Brother fantasy league!'

Whitney and her husband of nearly five years - former The City associate producer Tim Rosenman - have been 'obsessed' with the CBS reality competition for 'a couple years'

'Now I can text you about the episodes!' Whitney and her husband of nearly five years - former The City associate producer Tim Rosenman - have been 'obsessed' with the CBS reality competition for 'a couple years' (pictured last Friday)

'I love that so much now I can text you about the episodes!' Port gushed.

'This season [22] is having a slow start and I'm like waiting for it to pick up.'

The LA-born socialite and Conrad also agreed that there's no way either of them will ever join the trendy Chinese app TikTok.

'I've had so many meetings with different people and they're like, "You really need to post more. You need to be more real,"' the designer and cosmetics CEO explained.

'She's just the happiest thing ever!' The designer and cosmetics CEO revealed the guilty pleasure Instagram account she follows is Game of Thones alum Emilia Clarke because she's 'literally just like smiling and drinking dark liquor' (pictured 2017)

'They do a Cherry Garcia that's really good!' Lauren also dished on her guilty pleasure snack - Ben & Jerry's dairy-free ice-cream - because she's lactose intolerant and her son Liam has a dairy allergy

'And they'll send me examples, and it's like a 17-year-old TikToking. I was like, "I could be that person's mother. I'm not doing that."'

Whitney replied: 'Same! I'm sorry, TikTok, but I refuse to have a TikTok account. Like, I can't. Like there's only so much I can do. I'm doing City reaction videos on my YouTube. That's enough.'

Lauren revealed the guilty pleasure Instagram account she follows is Game of Thones alum Emilia Clarke because she's 'literally just like smiling and drinking dark liquor. She's just the happiest thing ever.'

Scared: Whitney - who suffered a miscarriage at six weeks gestation in July 2019 - has been divided on whether or not to give birth to a sibling for her three-year-old son Sonny because of breastfeeding and exhaustion (pictured December 30)

'My experience was pretty similar to yours': Conrad has two sons - Liam James, 3; and Charlie Wolf, 11 months - with her husband of six years, former Something Corporate guitarist William Tell (pictured December 2)

Lauren encouraged Whitney: 'My second trimester I was uncomfortable but it's like, "Oh I'm never going to have this again." ... With a second [baby], you're not as worried and you appreciate the little stuff more because you know how quickly it goes by' (pictured May 10)

Port - who suffered a miscarriage at six weeks gestation in July 2019 - has been divided on whether or not to give birth to a sibling for her three-year-old son Sonny because of breastfeeding and exhaustion.

Lauren has two sons - Liam James, 3; and Charlie Wolf, 11 months - with her husband of six years, former Something Corporate guitarist William Tell.

'My experience was pretty similar to yours. I did not enjoy being pregnant. I was grateful to be pregnant. I sort of had this guilt every time I was like, "I feel so big and uncomfortable, everything hurt, I had heartburn for six months. Like every single day, if I drank water I got heartburn. I was so uncomfortable,' Conrad explained.

'But I'll say this, the second time around you appreciate things in a different way...My second trimester I was uncomfortable but it's like, "Oh I'm never going to have this again." ... With a second, you're not as worried and you appreciate the little stuff more because you know how quickly it goes by.'
