Two Richmond stars were reportedly evicted from a Gold Coast strip club before brawling on the street, while everyday Australians are still banned from entering Queensland under Annastacia Palaszczuk's 'double-standard' border rules. 

Sydney Stack, 20, and Callum Coleman-Jones, 21 were involved in an altercation after being evicted from Hollywood Showgirls on the glitter strip's Orchid Ave at 3.30 Friday morning, the Courier Mail reports. 

Queensland Police said in a statement that two men were issued with an infringement notice for public nuisance (violent behaviour). 

'Police arrested two men following a disturbance in Surfers Paradise early this morning,' the statement read.

'Around 3.30am, officers responded to reports of two men, aged 20 and 21, involved in a physical altercation on Orchid Avenue.

'Both men sustained facial injuries as a result of the incident.

'The men were both issued with a Police Banning Notice, excluding them from Gold Coast Safe Night Precincts and a Penalty Infringement Notice (PIN) for Public Nuisance (Violent Behaviour). Further investigations are continuing into the matter.'

The AFL is aware of the matter and is currently investigating.  

About 400 AFL players, their families and officials have descended on Queensland under controversial quarantine arrangements.

They were given the all-clear to dodge the state's border lockdown in a bid to keep the AFL season going away from Melbourne's second coronavirus wave. 

It comes amid reports WAGs and officials are living it up in 'hotel quarantine' - sipping cocktails while lounging by the pool at their luxury Gold Coast resort. 

'We are doing this quarantine the same as everyone else,' AFL boss Gill McLachlan said this week.

But images and video that emerged on Thursday tell a different story - with the officials and families chilling out the four-and-half star Mercure Gold Coast resort.

Aerial footage - published by Nine News on Thursday - showed WAGs relaxing by the swimming pool at the quarantine resort as children splashed in the water.

The wives and girlfriends soaked up the sun with drinks in hand, just a few steps away from the poolside bar.

The vision is a world away from the experience of other travellers who have desperately fought to enter Queensland.

Jayne Brown, 60, spent two weeks confined to a tiny hotel room in Brisbane following her recent return from Sydney, where renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo removed two large tumours on her brain.

The grandmother-of-seven requested an exemption from hotel quarantine to self-isolate at home on the Sunshine Coast, but was rejected twice.

She blasted Ms Palaszczuk for allowing the AFL officials to enter the state on Tuesday night. 

'I don't understand it, mind-blowing,' Ms Brown told Nine News.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been criticised for easing her strict border controls to welcome the officials and their loved ones from coronavirus-riddled Victoria

Meanwhile, a Queensland grandmother was forced to recover from brain surgery in a quarantine hotel, while AFL officials have been exempt from strict quarantine rules 

The Queensland government has deemed all of Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT to be coronavirus hotspots.

Travellers from hotspot states who are granted a border declaration pass are required to spend 14 days in mandatory hotel quarantine, at their own cost.   

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg accused the Queensland government of double standards. 

Mr Frydenberg said the football hub showed two sets of rules on borders given regular punters had missed out on vital medical treatment.

'It's just not on that a young woman can lose an unborn child because of confusion at the borders,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday. 

'At the same time, footy officials can go down to their hotel bar as they so-called quarantine in Queensland.

'It seems double standards on our borders.'
