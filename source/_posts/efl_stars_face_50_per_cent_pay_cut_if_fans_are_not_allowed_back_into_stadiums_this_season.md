Football League players will lose half their wages if fans are not allowed into stadiums this season, Sportsmail can reveal.

Many EFL clubs put Covid clauses in players' contracts ahead of this season to protect themselves financially against the impact of the pandemic.

And in a document seen by this newspaper, a large number of players are contractually obliged to forgo half their wages while they are playing in front of empty stands.

Some EFL players will also lose 50 per cent of their wages if the season is curtailed, from the point any decision to end the campaign is made.

If fans are allowed back in reduced numbers, some clubs will enforce 25 per cent wage reductions for the period games are played in front of crowds of less than 75 per cent of the average attendance for the three months of competitive matches before restrictions came in.

The document also states that players are not entitled to the wages they have lost once football returns to normal.

Not all clubs in the EFL have introduced the clauses and the percentage cuts vary.

Some clubs have provided players with a window from the start of the season when they can recoup their wages in full, despite playing in empty stadiums — but that period is close to elapsing. The Government's move this week to scrap plans for fans to return from next month means players face going the vast majority of the season with drastic wage reductions.

The EFL, it is understood, want to be included in any financial aid made available by the Government, to help their clubs dealing with the renewed restrictions imposed this week.

The player contracts state, however, that any Government help would not impact wages according to the conditions.

The Professional Footballers' Association have advised members that reduction clauses are not obligatory — but indicated it may be in their long-term interest to accept cuts.
