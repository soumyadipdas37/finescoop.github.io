The Queen will return to public duties in time to lead the nation at Remembrance Day 'come hell or high water,' after isolating during lockdown.

Her Majesty, 94, has been in lockdown at Windsor Castle since March, unable to take part in public engagements.

But Royal insiders expect she will end her summer break early by returning to work at Buckingham Palace in October.

Queen Elizabeth II, picture at last year's Remembrance Sunday event, will be at the Cenotaph on November 8 'come hell or high water,' Royal sources said

Sources told The Sun she 'fully intends to be at the Cenotaph,' on November. 

One said: 'She'll be there come hell or high water.'

Queen Elizabeth II flew to Balmoral in August, and is expected to fly to Sandringham with Prince Phillip tomorrow.

But she could return to offices at Buckingham Palace at this month.

A Palace source told The Sun: 'The Queen wants to be leading from the front. Remembrance Sunday is a hugely important day for the country and for her personally.'

Her Majesty was seen wiping away a tear during last year's Remembrance Sunday as she watched alongside Camilla and Kate. 

Her Majesty has been in lockdown since March, but did step out to give Captain Tom Moore a knighthood

She has been unable to take part in events such as Trooping the Colour, and Maundy Thursday, along with Palace garden parties.

She continued to hold weekly calls with the Prime Minister, and did hold a socially-distance birthday party.

Her Majesty also stepped out to give NHS fundraising hero Captain Tom Moore a knighthood, and to attend Princess Beatrice's wedding.
