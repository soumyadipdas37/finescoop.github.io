Rebecca first showed off her fig plant, saying that she's had trouble keeping it alive during Melbourne's cold winter.

'He's so bloody sad! He's been there a year and was always thriving and amazing but by the end of the Melbourne winter, things just got too cold for him outside and he started loosing his leaves,' she said. 

'I'm hoping now that it's spring and it's warmer that he's going to fight back but things aren't looking good. Sorry mate!'  

Fiddle-leaf figs can range in price from $26 for smaller plants to $800 for larger ones.

Wisteria hysteria! Lastly, she showed off a wisteria vine next to her pool, explaining that was 'so excited' that the plant was finally blossoming after being cut back for renovations 

'This sounds really silly, but I'm so excited about my wisteria! We didn't get any flowers last year because they were still very cut back,' she said. 

'This is our first little hint of some flowers, of some colour and I'm just so excited for this wisteria to explode and for all the wisteria to hang down over the arches.'

Rebecca's garden features multiple arches, a swimming pool, a dining area and a tennis court.
