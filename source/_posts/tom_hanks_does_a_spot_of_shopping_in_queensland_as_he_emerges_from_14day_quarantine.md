Tom Hanks returned to Australia earlier this month to resume filming on Baz Lurhmann's Elvis Presley biopic.

On Tuesday, the Hollywood superstar looked like any other local as he took in a spot of shopping at Pacific Fair in Broadbeach, Queensland. 

The 64-year-old emerged from a 14-day mandatory quarantine and appeared in excellent spirits.

Tom dressed down in an Adidas tracksuit, consisting of a pair of pants with the iconic design of three white stripes down the side. 

He added a matching, long-sleeved, zip-up top from the same set, also in a black and white tone. 

Underneath, the Big actor opted for a simple black t-shirt, and he added a pale green and white cap to the ensemble.

He then traversed an escalator and appeared to be in the the company of multiple minders.  

Pals: The Splash actor walked along in the company of what appeared to be an assistant 

Chatting: Tom and his pal chatted as they walked around the shopping area

Just a regular guy! Tom fit right in with shoppers who didn't seem to notice his presence

The superstar and his entourage were rumoured to have spent 14 days isolating in a lavish Gold Coast mansion after being granted an exemption from hotel quarantine. 

While thousands of Australians are forced to stay in shoe box-sized hotel rooms guarded by the military, the A-lister and his cohorts were reported to be relaxing on the 55-acre grounds at the Rivermead Estate in Queensland.

But both the estate owners and the Queensland government have denied the rumours, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk insisting Hanks was staying in a Queensland Health-approved hotel.

He is starring in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley biopic, in which he is playing the rock legend's manager Colonel Tom Parker.
