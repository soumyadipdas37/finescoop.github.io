Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris spoke with Kenosha shooting victim Jacab Blake by phone Monday, while she was meeting with familly members in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  

The Biden campaign confirmed that Harris sat down with Jacob Blake Sr., the victim's father and his sisters Zietha Blake and Letetra Widman, as soon as she touched down in Milwaukee

Also present on the phone were Blake's mother, Julia Jackson, and attorney Ben Crump. 

Vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris is photographed arriving in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Monday. The first thing she did was meet with members of Jacob Blake's family and call the shooting victim and his mother by phone 

Harris, a California senator, is photographed walking inot a meeting with members of the Blake family. Reporters weren't allowed inside the meeting or the one with Democratic nominee Joe Biden 

Blake's two other lawyers, B’Ivory LaMarr and Patrick Salvi, Jr., were also present. 

It was essentially the same group that Democratic nominee Joe Biden had spoken with when he touched down in Milwaukee on Thursday.    

Jacob Blake is photographed in his hospital bed. He spoke to Joe Biden by phone on Thursday and Kamala Harris by phone on Monday 

Reporters weren't allowed in either meeting.  

'I had the opportunity to spend some time with Jacob on the phone. He's out of ICU. We spoke for about 15 minutes,' Biden said at the Grace Lutheren Church in Kenosha last week. 'He talked about how nothing was going to defeat him. Whether he walked again or not, he was not going to give up.'   

Biden and his wife Jill made a two-city trip to Wisconsin Thursday, a key swing state, first stopping in Milwaukee for a meeting with Blake's family members and then motorcading to Kenosha for a conversation with community stakeholders. 

The Biden visit marked the first time a Democratic presidential candidate visited Wisconsin since the 2012 cycle.  

Harris will spend the day in Milwaukee and tour an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, to mark the Labor Day holiday. 

She will then meet with Black Milwaukee business owners as part of the Biden-Harris' 'Build Back Better' agenda, according to the campaign.
