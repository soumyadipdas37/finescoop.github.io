Princess Charlene of Monaco shared a sweet embrace with her husband Prince Albert after finishing a grueling charity water bike challenge today.

The royal, 42, donned a red wetsuit as she completed The Crossing Calvi Monaco Water Bike Challenge earlier this afternoon.

The challenge, which sees two teams of four internationally renowned athletes take turns to 'cycle' 180km from Calvi, in Corsica, to Monaco, was launched by the royal to raise awareness and funds for her namesake foundation’s activities. 

Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques of Monaco, both five, attended the occasion with their father Albert, 62, to cheer on their mother Charlene from the sidelines. 

 Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star Conor McGregor had been preparing to take part but was forced to pull out as he waits to see if he will be re-arrested over alleged sexual assault and indecent exposure.

Prince Albert donned a facemask and a cap as he joined his wife alongside their young children to watch the challenge.

Princess Charlene leaned on her husband for support once the task was finished, embracing him and her team members. 

The event will benefit the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation and raise awareness of its programmes including 'Learn to Swim' and 'Water Safety', which have been implemented around the world. 

Since the creation of the Princess Charlene Foundation in 2012, more than 730,000 people, particularly children, have benefited from these three programmes in 34 countries.

Zimbabwean-born Charlene is a committed philanthropist and often draws on her athletic connections to raise money for the fund established in her name.

The Princess of Monaco represented South Africa at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and later retired from professional swimming in 2007.  

Charlene and Albert tied the knot in 2011 after five years together, going public with their relationship at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

Other athletes involved in the race include Olympic gold medallist, Yannick Angel, and Australian racing cyclist, David Tanner.

After completing the challenge herself, Princess Charlene went on to cheer for others from the stands

Retired UFC star Conor McGregor had planned to take part but was forced to withdraw as he waits to see if he will be re-arrested over alleged sexual assault and indecent exposure.

McGregor is waiting for the results of ‘key physical tests’ and ‘the examination of film evidence’ before learning whether he will be re-arrested.

The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star was taken into police custody on the French holiday island of Corsica last Friday following a complaint from a young woman.

She has claimed the 32-year-old Irishman assaulted her and showed off his manhood following a heavy drinking session in the upmarket port town of Calvi on September 6.

Charlene appeared emotional as she completed the challenge today while her team mates were elated  

McGregor was released on Saturday without charge, but the criminal case is still active and he could be summoned before a magistrate later this week.

Emmanuelle Ramon, McGregor’s lawyer, said his client ‘vigorously denied any wrongdoing’.

‘He has been released before the legal end of police custody and without any judicial review,’ said Mr Ramon.

Audie Attar, McGregor’s manager, said in a statement: ‘I am irate and putting out a warning loud and clear: Conor McGregor is not and will not be a target for those seeking to score a headline or a payday.’
