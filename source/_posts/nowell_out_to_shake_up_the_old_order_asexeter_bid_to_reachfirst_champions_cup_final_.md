Ten years ago, Exeter Chiefs had just been promoted from the second division of English rugby and Toulouse were crowned champions of Europe.

Times have changed. Back then, Jack Nowell was an academy hopeful, but on Saturday the England winger is hoping to shake up the old order.

Exeter are plotting to reach their first ever Champions Cup final and Nowell insists they are ready for the biggest stage.

‘If you’d said to me 10 years ago, when I was 17 and still at College, that I’d be in a European Cup semi-final at Sandy Park against Toulouse, then I wouldn’t have believed you. I thought I’d have been on trawler fishing with my old man.

‘But we are very greedy now. We’ve had a taste and want more. We’ve got the players now, got the experience, played big games at Twickenham, played for the country. We want it extremely badly. We’re ready. The next step for us is the Heineken and we’re in a very good position this year.’

Nowell will be coming up against fellow winger and World Cup-winning Springbok Cheslin Kolbe.

‘He’s pretty special, isn’t he?’ said Nowell. ‘Size doesn’t matter on a rugby field. He’s a prime example of that. 

'He’s not the biggest of fellas but he’s extremely quick, strong for his size. He’s one of those who you think you might have tackled but you’ve got to make sure he is on the ground and out of the game. You can’t give him space.

‘We are the same age so we played under 20s together. We’ve followed each other all the way through. He is obviously going to be a handful. We’ve spoken about him. 

'But they’ve got threats throughout the team. But we’ve got ours too. We’re now we’re going to have to look out for him on the field, soak up what he has got to give but also try to fire a few shots ourselves.’
