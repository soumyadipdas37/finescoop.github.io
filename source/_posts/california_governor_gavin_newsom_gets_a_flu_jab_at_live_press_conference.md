California governor Gavin Newsom had a flu jab during a live press conference as he urges people to get vaccinated to prevent a 'twindemic' of influenza and Covid-19 this winter. 

Newsom, 52, completed the 30-second process in front of the cameras to 'demonstrate how simple it is and how safe it is' as the flu season draws in. 

The Democratic governor warned there were early signs of a rise in coronavirus cases in the Bay Area and Southern California, saying school and business re-openings could be delayed further if infections rebound in the fall. 

An industry expert said a possible slowdown of business re-openings could not come at a worse time, especially for retailers who depend on the holiday shopping season for a majority of their annual sales. 

California's Democratic governor Gavin Newsom broke off from a live press conference to have a flu jab (pictured) as he warned of a possible 'twindemic' of influenza and Covid-19 

Newsom said it was only weeks before 'we move into the peak of our flu season', with signs of transmission starting already. 

'By getting a flu shot you protect yourself and you mitigate the impact of what some have referred to as the twindemic,' he said.  

He warned that a second wave of coronavirus combined with the flu season would lead to the infections 'putting pressure on our hospital system, draining resources and impacting the quality care that all of you deserve and respect'. 

'That's why getting a flu shot is so important. I've done this every single year as long as I can remember,' he said. 

'It is a simple thing to do, and getting a flu shot is a safe thing to do. In an effort to demonstrate how simple it is and how safe it is, I thought I would just take a moment of your time and take the opportunity to get a flu shot here.' 

Newsom then took a seat next to a doctor wearing a mask and a lab coat, and took his jacket off to reveal a Cal Fire T-shirt underneath.

Within 30 seconds, the female doctor had syringed Newsom's right arm and put a plaster over the hole in his skin. 

'About as simple a thing as any of us can do, so I encourage everybody to get a flu shot,' Newsom told viewers.

The Democratic governor warned there were early signs of a rise in coronavirus cases in the Bay Area and Southern California, saying flu and Covid together would drain resources 

Newsom warned of a 'plateau' in coronavirus cases after weeks of decline (pictured, California's infection graph which reached its peak in July) 

At the same press conference, Newsom warned there were signs of a potential rise in coronavirus cases after a significant slowdown in August and early September. 

While hospitalizations and ICU admissions are down, cases have plateaued after weeks of decline and some regions are 'beginning to see an upward trend' in the R rate, Newsom warned. 

The R rate in the Bay Area and Southern California has edged closer to the critical threshold of 1 at which cases may increase exponentially, official figures show. 

Newsom warned that a rise in cases could prompt a longer shutdown of businesses and lead to further delays in re-opening schools.  

Rex Hime, president and CEO of the California Business Properties Association, a group representing owners of commercial properties, said the consequences of a third shutdown 'will be devastating.' 

Newsom said his message to the business community and parents of school-aged children is to 'abide by these mask mandates.'

California saw its worst day of the pandemic on July 21 when the state piled up 12,807 new infections at the height of America's second wave. 

The state saw a record 219 deaths on July 31, but that figure has since fallen to an average of around 80 per day. 

California has seen 807,425 cases in total, a rate of 2,036 infections per 100,000 people which is slightly lower than the US average.
