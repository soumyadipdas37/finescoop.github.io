Jose Mourinho is still trying to create a more balanced Tottenham squad and intends to use the transfer market to do it.

Mourinho has said he has 'too many players' on his books, but having already signed five players this summer, the club are still on the lookout for at least two more.

They have been in discussions with Inter Milan over central defender Milan Skriniar and are still searching for a striker to take the load off Harry Kane.

Several players are available to leave the club and with just over a week to go Mourinho says they are still trying to do business.

'Is the club trying to build that balanced squad that we all want, yes we are trying. Let's see if that's possible.'

One of those five players who have already joined is Joe Hart, who signed on a free transfer in August.

The former England international made his debut in Thursday night's Europa League qualifying win over Shkendija, a game Spurs won 3-1 in North Macedonia.

Hart is expected to give up his place to Spurs captain Hugo Lloris as Newcastle visit on Sunday, but the veteran knows the importance of the game.

'That's important right now,' he told the club's official website. 'We've games coming thick and fast, Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday, and I know people say you get paid to play football, but it is tough, a big ask.

'It's a really important match, they all are. We had a meeting at the start of the season and there are obviously a lot of goals in the long term, but in the short term it's to win every game. Now we focus our attention on Newcastle.

'That's the most important game for us now.'
