Dawid Malan has risen to No 1 in the Twenty20 international batting rankings following England's 2-1 series win over Australia.

Yorkshire batsman Malan jumped four places in the ratings after stacking up 129 runs, including a man-of-the-match 66 in the opening match of three at the Ageas Bowl.

The 33-year-old is eight points ahead of Pakistan's Babar Azam, in a list that includes Indian superstar Virat Kohli in ninth place and England's World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan in 10th.

Adil Rashid, Malan's county colleague, has moved up to seventh from ninth following another fine white-ball series in which he took six wickets.

England have strengthened their second-placed position, improving their ranking by three points by virtue of defeating the No 1-ranked team - although they would have taken over at the summit themselves had they avoided defeat in the series finale on Tuesday evening.

Malan's achievement is all the more remarkable given that he is not guaranteed a place in England's best XI - he was omitted on the tour of South Africa earlier this year and would likely be ousted again when Jason Roy and Ben Stokes are available.

'When you get limited opportunities, you have to make full use of them,' said a player who has passed 50 in exactly half of his 16 T20 international innings.

'So to do that when you're under pressure is very satisfying. For anyone to break in to this team, you have to be extremely consistent and win games of cricket for England.'
