Parents of stillborn babies will be granted a year of unpaid leave under new laws proposed by the federal government. 

Under current rules, parents who suffer a stillbirth or infant death now only get a guaranteed six weeks of unpaid leave before they can be required to return to work.

The government wants to change the law to give them up to 12 months off, the same amount granted to parents of healthy babies.

More than 2,000 Australian families experience a stillbirth each year, while many more lose a child soon after birth from medical complications.

Attorney-General Christian Porter said: 'This change to unpaid leave entitlements will give these parents the time and space they need to grieve the loss of their baby, without having to worry about returning to work before they're ready to do so.'

Interest groups representing parents who experience stillbirth and premature birth were consulted about the idea. 

The government is also removing a barrier that prevented parents of premature babies from pausing their leave while their child is in hospital.

'Parents have told us that not being able to pause their leave while their child is in hospital meant that they had little or no leave left once their baby was ready to come home,' the Attorney-General said.

'These changes will give parents that flexibility and ensure they will get to spend quality time at home with their child when the time is right.'

Employees will also be allowed to to use up to 30 days of their year off at any time up to two years after the birth or adoption of their child. 

The chances will be made under The Fair Work Amendment (Improving Unpaid Parental Leave for Parents of Stillborn Babies and Other Measures) Bill, 2020.
