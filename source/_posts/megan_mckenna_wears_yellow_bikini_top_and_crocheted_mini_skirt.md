New love: It was recently reported that Megan is 'smitten' with her new businessman beau Josh after he won her heart over during a series of fancy dinner dates

Last month it was reported that Megan is 'smitten' with her new businessman beau Josh after he won her heart over during a series of fancy dinner dates. 

Josh is said to have wined and dined the reality star as they enjoyed a date at the swanky Mayfair restaurant Hakkasan, where they originally met earlier in 2020.  

He is the company director of the online men's fashion brand, Yelir World, which has been featured in GQ and has been worn by Wayne Rooney. 

A source confirmed to The Sun that the pair are now an item and are planning their future together.  

They said to the website: 'Megan and Josh have been dating for a few months. They’re totally smitten, it’s very sweet to see.

'The pair of them are taking it slow but they have been talking about the future.'

Beauty: Megan originally made her name on MTV dating series Ex On The Beach when she would become embroiled in volatile altercations with other contestants
