Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not tolerate people smuggling in any form, and are doing all we can to tackle those responsible for this appalling trade.

'This was a reckless attempt to circumvent our border controls and anyone in doubt about the consequences of such actions should take note - you will be caught and put behind bars.'

The Home Office said the cases of the family are being dealt with according to the immigration rules.
