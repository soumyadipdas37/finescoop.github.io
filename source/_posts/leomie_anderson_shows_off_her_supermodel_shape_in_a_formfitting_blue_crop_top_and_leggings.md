She has walked the runway for Victoria's Secret - and Leomie Anderson looked like she had just strutted off the catwalk as she stepped out in central London on Tuesday.

The supermodel, 27, displayed her svelte physique in a form-fitting sporty blue crop top as she arrived at the Capital Xtra offices in Leicester Square. 

The catwalk queen teamed her zip-up top with matching cobalt and lilac leggings as she headed inside.

Leomie displayed her toned stomach in the sculpting two-piece from activewear company, Lapp The Brand. 

She paired the look with colourful Nike trainers and a Dior rucksack. 

The catwalk model styled her raven tresses in a textured high ponytail and opted for low-key make-up that highlighted her stunning features. 

Leomie recently joined forces with TOWIE star Vas J Morgan, actress Jodie Turner-Smith and Little Mix's Leigh-Anne Pinnock to raise mental health awareness for the black community.

In the powerful video campaign, the stars all wore charity t-shirts as they emotionally declared: 'I am enough,' among other messages of empowerment.   

Starting the video, Jodie, 34, said: 'I allow myself to be the full expression of who I really am.'  

Leigh-Anne, 28, added: 'My race is healthy and good.' 

Vas announced: 'My sexuality is healthy and good.'

The former TOWIE star, 31, created the powerful video to help those dealing with trauma, racism or mental health related issues. 

He added: 'Mental health awareness is very important and it's vital to say it, repeat it, believe it and share it. I am Vas J Morgan and I am enough.' 

Talking about what the campaign means to him in a passionate statement, the star added: 'Like so many black people, my mental health has been deeply impacted by events this year. 

'For me, they have brought back a lot of traumatic memories of low self-esteem and self-hate, essentially being told that black was wrong. 

'If I was feeling this way, I knew many others within the black community would be feeling exactly the same too. 

'I've been fortunate to have received extensive treatment for my own mental battles in the past but know many aren't so lucky. 

'This is why I wanted to launch this campaign, to show people that they are enough and provide them with the vital support they need.'

The end of the video promotes the charity T-shirts which are available to buy online, with all proceeds donated to the I Am Enough fund, providing free mental health support for the black community. 

So far, the campaign has raised more than £50,000.
