Ashlee Simpson was seen flaunting her baby bump in her neighborhood of Encino as she shopped for groceries at Gelson's supermarket.

Despite being a few months out from giving birth, the 35-year-old looked incredibly put together as she presented a cool display for her day of errands.

This comes after the blonde beauty and her husband, singer Evan Ross, recently upgraded their home as they prepare for the arrival of their new baby.

Ashley wore a long, black, form-fitting dress under a pale yellow blazer. 

She matched her egg-colored Converse high-top sneakers to her jacket for a cohesive look as she adjusted her phone case that was hanging from her shoulder. 

The singer held her pink fuzzy car key chain in her hand and suited up in a pair of plastic gloves and a black mask before entering the store. 

She accessorized her look with a pair of vintage-looking white sunglasses as she kept her blonde locks tied back in a low bun with a scrunchie. 

Quick stop: Ashlee could be seen grabbing the essentials as she stocked up on water and an assortment of food as she continued out of the store

Not present was husband Evan, 32, or their daughter Jagger, five. 

Ashlee also shares 11-year-old son Bronx with her ex-husband Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz. This will be Evan's second baby with the Autobiography singer. 

Evan and Ashley have been friends for over 10 years and got engaged in January 2014 after less than a year of dating; they had their wedding the following August. 

Growing love: The couple have been married for six years and are madly in love as the pair continue to expand their family 

Shortly thereafter she became pregnant with their daughter Jagger. 

Evan shared a video last week of Jagger singing to Alicia Key's This Girl Is On Fire. With both parents being singers and her grandma being legendary crooner Diana Ross, the child is definitely primed for music. 

Speaking to ET about their marriage Ross said 'The biggest thing in this world is being in love. I’m so in love. I love my daughter, I love my wife. She’s given me the best gift in the world. I’m very lucky.' 

The couple announced their second pregnancy in April of this year as Ashlee is expected to give birth to a baby boy sometime this fall.

Everything: Ashlee took to instagram to express her undying love and commitment to her husband of six years as she called him her 'everything' 

Taking to Instagram to pay a sweet birthday tribute to her man in late August, Simpson expressed her undying love.  

'I love you so much baby....YOU are my everything...I can’t imagine this life without you. You brighten everyday. I love you so very much baby' she wrote.  

A couple days later the two celebrated their six year anniversary. 

As they prepare for their new arrival it seems as if all plans revolve around their new future, as the couple just purchased a 6,250 square foot house in Encino for $4.5M to make more space. 

Speaking to People about her pregnancy, Ashlee shared her excitement. 'Newborn babies smell so good. There's nothing like it. And we can't wait for the snuggles!' she said. 

Pregnancy glam: Ashlee has maintained her edgy sense of style throughout her pregnancy as she always remains effortlessly cool and put together while prioritizing comfort
