Russian car lovers donned vintage outfits to flock the streets of Moscow and mark the 50th anniversary of the creation of the popular Lada car yesterday. 

Gathering for the Gorkyclassic GUM Rally, the vintage vehicle enthusiasts celebrated the creation of one of their countries most well-known and trusted cars, with models dating back to the 1970s at the heart of the celebration.

The classic car show, which takes place once a year in the Russian capital, sees vintage car lovers gather together, some opting for vintage looks to go with their vehicles. 

The Lada, which was first commercialised in 1970, was manufactured by AvtoVAZ, a Russian company now owned by the French group Renault.

The original 1970 Lada car was the star of this year's show with several models making it to the rally. 

Families walked up to the Lada models, all parked together during the show, some of which were adorned with GUM rally stickers. 

AvtoVAZ's Lada, which was first manufactured in 1970, with technical help from Fiat, takes its name from a type of small boat in Slavic language. 

It was born out of a cooperation agreement between Fiat and the Soviet minister of automotive industry Alexander Tarasov signed in 1966. 

Other rally goers wore a selection of vintage costumes for the occasion, with one woman opting for a jumpsuit and red head scarf

The cars first appeared in Russia under the Zhiguli brand, but the brand's name was changed to Lada when the vehicle began to be commercialised internationally. 

The first ever Lada to be built was produced on the 100th anniversary of Lenin's Birth on April 1970. 

The Lada VAZ-2101 was the first vehicle to make it to the market in Russia. Its design was derived from the Fiat 124 Sedan. 

There were very few repair shops around the country, and the Lada was marketed as DIY-friendly and easy to maintain. 

Women in costumes and vintage outfits strolled through the streets next to members of the public as they attended the car rally
