A middle-aged man has admitted to beating and stabbing his elderly parents to death in the house the trio shared in southern Sydney. 

David Reid, 47, pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in the New South Wales Supreme Court on Friday. 

The IT worker killed his mother Dianna Reid, 71, and father Victor Graham Reid, 75, in their Sutherland home in August 2019. 

His defence barrister said there is a 'significant medical issue that needs to be explored' and said four psychiatrists are set to testify at a February sentencing hearing, according to The Daily Telegraph. 

Reid was arrested at the Tudar Rd property in the south Sydney suburb of Bonnet Bay after he called police and allegedly threatened self-harm. 

He led officers inside the house where they discovered his parents' bodies. 

Police said his parents died from 'multiple injuries.' 

After he was arrested he spent five days in hospital with serious injuries on his hand and was later put on suicide watch while in custody.

Reid is in a vulnerable position in custody and needs protection as he recovers from injuries sustained during the alleged attack, according to his barrister 

Reid, who had worked for casino gaming manufacturer Konami for the past 20 years, had reportedly battled mental health issues in the past.

Concerns were raised last week when Reid showed up at work acting 'more strange than usual'.

He had 'a noticeable amount of blood' on the back of his neck and shirt collar when he arrived at his Botany office on last Monday, a colleague told the Sydney Morning Herald. 

The worker said no one wanted to ask him about the blood as his behaviour had changed. 

Mr and Mrs Reid had been members of their local Jannali Anglican Church for more than 50 years. 

Neighbours say Reid had been living with his parents his entire life. 

Dianna Reid and her husband Victor Graham Reid were found dead in the family home last Tuesday
