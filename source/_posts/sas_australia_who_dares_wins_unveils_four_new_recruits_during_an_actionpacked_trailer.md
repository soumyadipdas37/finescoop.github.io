Four new recruits have been unveiled during the dramatic new trailer for Channel Seven's new military-style reality show SAS Australia: Who Dares Wins.

Australian Rules Footballer Sabrina Frederick, Olympic swimmer James Magnussen, cricket star Mitchell Johnson and suspended swimmer Shayna Jack are put through their paces in the action-packed new promo.

While Sabrina confidently declares she's ready to bring home a win for the ladies, a teary-eyed Shayna finds herself crumbling amid gruelling interrogation from former British soldier and Chief Instructor, Ant Middleton.

The promo begins with Ant coldly announcing: 'I don't care how rich they are, [and] how many followers they've got on social media.

'They've entered our world now... they're not going to know what's hit them. We will expose the deepest darkest part of them.'

An accompanying montage of larger than life action shots sees alarmed recruits jumping out of helicopters, scaling mountains and carrying each other on their backs.

Cricket legend Mitchell, 38, then says: 'I want the excitement and the adrenaline rush that cricket gave me.'

'The hardest question you could ever ask me!' A teary-eyed Shayna finds herself crumbling amid gruelling interrogation from former British soldier and Chief Instructor, Ant Middleton

Confident in her abilities, footballer Sabrina, 23, adds: 'Australia know me as an AFL player. I'm here to prove that women can win this!'

Ready for his second shot at glory, Olympian James reveals: 'I came up short at the Olympics, failure is not an option this time.'

Disgraced swimmer Shayna, 21 - who was suspended from swimming after she allegedly tested positive for a banned black market muscle-builder in July 2019 - admits she's 'going to prove she's not a drug cheat.'

Ant pitilessly asks her: 'What if you can't ever swim again?'

Shayna's eyes well up with tears, as she admits: 'That's probably the hardest question anyone could ever ask me.'

The military-style show will see contestants having to endure sleep deprivation, interrogation and physical endurance.

Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby was also a part of the show's line-up, and even filmed some scenes, before deciding to quit after reportedly being 'iced out' by other contestants.

Disgraced ex-WAG Arabella Del Busso, publicist Roxy Jacenko, Candice Warner, Merrick Watts and Nick Cummins are also confirmed for the show.

SAS Australia is a remake of the hit British TV show SAS: Who Dares Wins and will put stars through their paces as they attempt to pass the selection process to join the Australian Army's elite Special Air Service.

Filming began earlier this year in Queenstown, New Zealand, however, it recently resumed in the Snowy Mountains, New South Wales, due to strict international travel restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic.

SAS Australia premieres this October on Channel Seven.
