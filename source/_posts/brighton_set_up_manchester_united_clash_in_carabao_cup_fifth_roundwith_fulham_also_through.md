Brighton face a repeat visit from this Saturday’s Premier League opponents Manchester United in the last 16 after goals from Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Alexis Mac Allister secured a 2-0 win at Preston. 

Pascal Gross saw a free-kick saved, with Jahanbakhsh also having an effort kept out. 

Brighton boss Graham Potter made 11 changes from the 3-0 Premier League win against Newcastle.

Fulham booked a rematch of the Championship play-off final against Brentford with a comfortable 2-0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday.

Scott Parker’s side won promotion to the Premier League by beating their local rivals 2-1 in August and the Bees will be on a revenge mission in the Carabao Cup fourth round.

First-half goals from Aboubakar Kamara and Bobby Decordova-Reid were enough to see off a weakened Wednesday side.

Josh Brownhill’s long-range strike shortly before half-time put Burnley ahead at Millwall before Matej Vydra sealed a 2-0 win. Sean Dyche’s men will host the winner of tonight’s clash between Manchester City and Bournemouth.

Stoke striker Tyrese Campbell struck the winner in a 1-0 home victory over Gillingham.

His side await the winner of Bristol City against Aston Villa.
