The teenager reported the alleged assault to police in June 2020.   

Police will allege the man met the teenager two years ago at a school on the mid-north coast.

The man allegedly began to message the girl on social media.  

'It will be further alleged the man sent sexually explicit material to the girl, and sexually assaulted her on two occasions between July 2018 and June 2019,' NSW Police said in a statement.

The former student teacher appeared at Port Macquarie Bail Court on September 5.

He was granted strict conditional bail.

The man will next appear in court on November 5.

Investigations into the allegations continue.
