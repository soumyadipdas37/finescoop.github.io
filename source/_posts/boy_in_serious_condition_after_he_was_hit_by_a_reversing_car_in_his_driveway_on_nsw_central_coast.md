Motorists are urged to be extra vigilant and keep a frequent lookout for young children during the school holidays.

At least one child is run over in the driveway of their home each week in Australia, according to KidSafe NSW.

Eight children are killed each year after being hit or run over by a vehicle at home and while another 60 are seriously injured.

Most children run over by a vehicle at home are aged under-5.
