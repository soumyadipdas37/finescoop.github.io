Scott McTominay has opened up on the anguish of dealing with his recent long-term injury, as the Manchester United midfielder revealed his parents moved in with him to help him cope with being away from first-team action. 

The 23-year-old had impressed since breaking into the senior squad under former boss Jose Mourinho but was hit by a long-term knee injury during United's 4-1 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. 

By the time Project Restart got underway, the Scotland international had returned to full fitness but could only find himself rotated in and out of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side. 

Scott McTominay has opened up on the mental toll that long-term injuries have on footballers

The 23-year-old was sidelined for a long spell after picking up a knee injury on Boxing Day

And the United star has revealed the mental toll that such a setback has on a young footballer, and expressed the importance of family support during difficult times. 

'Whenever it's all going swimmingly, you're playing every week and scoring a few goals here and there, it's good. Then you get a setback and you have to react to that,' he told the Official Scotland national team podcast. 

'You can't hang your head and be disappointed about that. You have to think about when you'll be back and set dates for yourself to push yourself back from injury as well as you can without re-injuring yourself.  

McTominay revealed that his parents moved in with him to keep him on track for recovery

'A lot of that does come from the people you've got around you, your family… my mum and dad stayed at my house for two or three months when I got injured,' he revealed. 

'They made sure I ate all the right foods, which I do anyway, checking if there's anything you need. They're the type of people who get you through stuff; always having someone there to speak to if you're having a tougher time.

'For me, it went so quick from when I first got injured [in December] - my knee, that was 10 weeks - that went really quick because I had people around, coming to see me. You can't really do much when you're on crutches! 

The Scotland international made a speedy recovery to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a big boost

'The physios at the club were amazing and they pushed me every single day to my limits to get me back as quick as I could, and it shows when you come back to matches and you're ready. You're only mugging yourself off if you don't come back in that way.' 

The defensive midfielder has scored seven goals and provided an assist in his 84 outings for the Red Devils, and will be hoping that he can force his way into the starting eleven as United prepare for a run in the Champions League and attempt to close the gap on Liverpool and Man City in the Premier League.
