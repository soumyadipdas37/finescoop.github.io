Will Hughes has become a surprise transfer target for Tottenham Hotspur, according to reports. 

The 25-year-old midfielder was part of the Watford side that was relegated from the Premier League last season, with Hughes scoring one league goal in the disappointing campaign.  

Spurs boss Jose Mourinho is looking to continue his overhaul of the north Londoners this summer and is plotting his fourth signing of the window.

And according to The Sun, the Portuguese coach is a big admirer of Hughes, who is rated at £13million, due to his versatility across the midfield.

The Hornets man is naturally a central midfielder, but the left-footed Englishman can also operate on either flank, with most of his performances last season coming from the right-hand side. 

Hughes made the step up to the Premier League by joining Watford from Derby County in 2017 and has since played 87 matches in all competitions for the Vicarage Road side.

The midfielder came through the youth ranks at Derby and had been linked with a move to Liverpool before joining Watford three years ago. 

He was called up to the England Under-21s squad at the age of 17 and made 22 appearances for the young Lions between 2012 and 2017.  

Mourinho has already brought in Southampton midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Wolverhampton Wanderers' Matt Doherty and England international goalkeeper Joe Hart on a free transfer.

The north London club are looking to make more additions to their squad but fear they may need to sell players before they make new signings.

Defenders Juan Foyth, Serge Aurier and Danny Rose could be part of the Tottenham exodus this summer, along with second-choice shot stopper Paulo Gazzaniga. 

Mourinho is also reportedly keen on Brentford striker Ollie Watkins, who scored 26 goals in the Championship last term and is available for around £25million.
