An old bucket factory has been converted into a trendy three-storey house on the outskirts of Sydney CBD, complete with upstairs and downstairs living rooms, antique timber beams and a rear made entirely of glass.

Built in the 1880s, 38 Foucart Street is regarded as a local landmark in Rozelle in the city's inner-west, and has been used as a church mission hall and photography studio since it was built roughly 140 years ago.

After falling into disrepair in the second half of the 20th century, the dilapidated warehouse was bought for $950,000 in 2002 by private owners who hired an architect to transform it into a modern family home.

The result of the redesign is a four-bedroom, two-bathroom semi-detached residence overlooking the city skyline, still fronted with the original brickwork and double door of the factory facade.

Spread over 173 square metres, the renovated house is described as a 'sanctuary where space, style and privacy' are equally balanced.

This is thanks to features like a quiet upstairs living room - perfect for study and reading - and a landscaped garden patio.

That contrast runs throughout, with the historic brick front cleverly juxtaposing the contemporary glass walled rear.

Upstairs, the window of the master bedroom offers unrestricted views of city skyscrapers including the iconic Sydney Tower Eye. 

Each of the two bathrooms are decorated in a monochromatic white colour scheme, with luxury fixtures like silver tapware and a hotel-style free-standing bathtub.

Other standout features include a wine cellar and off-street parking.

Listing agent Cindy Kennedy from McGrath realtors called it 'one of the most unique' houses to come up for sale in central Sydney for many years.

'The facade is simply divine and it really captures the interest of locals whenever they walk past,' she told realestate.com.au.

Ms Kennedy described the house as the perfect space for young families, with enough room for kids to play while parents and guests relax in others. 

The house has already proved popular among prospective buyers since it hit the market with a guide price of $2.5million last week.
