Xbox Series X UK pre-orders have gone live today September 22. A wide array of retailers from Amazon to GAME  are stocking the next-gen consoles so we're hopeful there won't be any problems snapping one up.

The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S look likely to feature in a few Christmas stockings this year, as they're launching globally on November 10.

Pre-orders will start for all retailers listed below from 8am BST, with the Xbox Series X priced at £449.99 and the Xbox Series S at £249.99.

The Xbox Series X (£449.99) and Series S (£249.99) pre-orders open today from 8am BST 

This is in addition to Xbox All Access, which lets you spread the cost of the console over a 24-month period with no interest. The Xbox Series X is priced at £28.99 and the Xbox Series S at £20.99 monthly. This also comes with 24-month Game Pass Ultimate - a library of the best games for you and your friends on the same plan to enjoy.

Plus, as recently announced, EA Play will be coming to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate later this year, which will give you access to some of EA's flagship titles such as FIFA, Battlefield and the Star Wars franchise.
