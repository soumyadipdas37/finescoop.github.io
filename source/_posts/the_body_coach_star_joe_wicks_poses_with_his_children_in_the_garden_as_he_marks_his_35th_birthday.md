He helped keep the nation fit during lockdown by hosting daily PE sessions from his London home and raised more than £500,000 for the NHS in the process.

And Joe Wicks celebrated entering a new chapter of his life as he marked his 35th birthday on Monday.

In a snap uploaded to Instagram, the Body Coach star appeared in great spirits as he posed in the garden of his home with his children Indie, two, and Marley, nine months, who he shares with his model wife Rosie Jones.

The YouTuber, who recently moved into a new home, wore a T-shirt and shorts as he knelt in front of gold age balloons.

'I’m 35 today. Spending the day with my little family. Have a great day everyone❤️', the online personality captioned the image.

Last month, the fitness instructor confirmed his hugely popular YouTube exercise sessions made a comeback.  

Just months after retiring the charitable endeavour as lockdown restrictions eased, the father-of-two made a dramatic U-turn and opted to lead more sessions for fans.

Here we go again: Last month, the fitness instructor confirmed his hugely popular YouTube exercise sessions made a comeback after giving it up in June

He told followers: 'That’s it I can’t leave it any longer. I’ve felt as flat as pancake since PE with Joe ended and the truth is I really miss it. 

'I miss the energy it gave me and the sense of purpose I had everyday. I miss the lean backs, the silly billy’s and all the happy faces taking part at home with me. 

'I’ve decided i’m coming back for another session. This Saturday morning I’ll be going LIVE for another workout at 9am on my YouTube channel. The first workout live from my new home. 

'Will you join in for the reunion? I cant wait to train with you again. Please share and tag friends in this post.' 

Joe previously admitted he feels 'lost' and lacks 'purpose' after ending his lessons, which saw him become a national treasure.

He revealed he 'had a few flat days' ever since minimising the frequency of his workouts to three times a week.

Crediting exercise for helping him get through his rough patch, the exercise guru vowed to 'regain my energy and get myself into a positive mindset' as he updated fans in between a gruelling session at his home gym.

The media personality told fellow social media users: 'So I'm half way through my workout, I can't explain how much better I feel emotionally and mentally.

'I've been having a flat few days. I was thinking about P.E. with Joe and the whole impact of what that was doing.'

Detailing the difference between his mindset when he tutored the world from his living room in Richmond and now, the Epsom native added: 'I had so much purpose.

'I was driven and focused and I knew what I was doing - making people feel good. That's when I'm at my happiest.

 'Now that's gone I feel confused and lost, but I know I'm going to regain my energy and get myself into a positive mindset.'

The hunk is rumoured to be worth nearly £6million after becoming the nation's PE teacher.

According to The Sun, his company Joe Wicks Ltd has assets of £3,478,270 and investments worth £3,722,256. 

It looks after the fitness expert's projects including his TV and books and online videos. The accounts show that the coach also had £343,838 cash in the bank.
