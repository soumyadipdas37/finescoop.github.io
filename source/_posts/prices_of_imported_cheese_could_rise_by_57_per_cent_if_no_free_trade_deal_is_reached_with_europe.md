Prices of European food in shops will soar if the UK fails to broker a free trade agreement with the bloc, retailers have warned. 

The British Retail Consortium said supermarkets and their customers face £3.1billion of food and drink tariffs a year - an average £112 per household - if trade barriers are erected.

More than 85 per cent of European imports will be slapped with tariffs greater than 5 per cent in a no-deal scenario, while the average duty would be a hefty 20 per cent.

The group reeled off many staple foods which will be hit with tariffs, including '48 per cent on beef mince, 16 per cent on cucumbers, 10 per cent on lettuce, and 57 per cent on cheddar cheese.'

By these calculations, a £3 pack of Irish beef mince would jump to £4.08, while a Spanish cucumber would cost 47p rather than 43p.

A £6.94 kilo of EU cheddar would theoretically rise by £3.96 to £10.90 - although the UK is a producer of cheese much is still imported from abroad.

Retailers have already signaled they would not be prepared to absorb the tax hikes and have urged ministers to thrash out a deal to avoid consumers bearing the brunt. 

Andrew Opie, Director of Food & Sustainability the British Retail Consortium, said: 'There is no time to waste, the UK and EU must hammer out a final arrangement as soon as possible. 

'Coronavirus is already making life hard for consumers, particularly those on lower incomes and, and a no-deal Brexit will have a massive impact on their ability to afford essential goods.

'UK consumers have benefitted from great value, quality, and choice of food thanks to our ability to trade tariff free with the EU.

'There is now the risk of a £3bn tax bill for the food we cannot source here in the UK. 

'Unless we negotiate a zero-tariff deal with the EU, the public will face higher prices for their weekly shop. This would prevent harm to shoppers, retailers and the wider economy.'

The UK formally left the EU last January but remains part of its Customs Union and Single Market until the end of the year when the transition period closes, meaning imports from the bloc are not subject to tariffs.

Unless a deal is reached, the UK will in January begin trading with the EU using the UK Global Tariff.  

British officials led by Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove are locked in talks with Brussels to strike an agreement and avoid such a scenario.

But negotiations have stalled because of two noticeable sticking points - fisheries and the rules governing state aid.

The EU also reacted angrily to Boris Johnson's Internal Market Bill, which they say overrides part of the Withdrawal Agreement struck last year. 

A government spokeswoman said: 'Negotiations are ongoing and discussions will be continuing at the next formal round in Brussels next week.'

'The UK is a significant importer of food and other goods, and avoiding tariffs should be beneficial to both sides, particularly given our shared commitment to high regulatory standards.'
