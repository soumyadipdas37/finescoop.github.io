Nine days after the unexpected death of Chadwick Boseman, his friends and family gathered in Malibu for a small memorial service. 

His Black Panther co-stars including Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke were in attendance, according to photos obtained by The Sun. 

Boseman's wife Taylor Simone Ledward joined the actors to honor her late husband who died after a four year long battle with colon cancer on August 28 at 43-years-old.

Jordan took to Instagram just days after Boseman's passing, sharing several photos of himself with his co-star, along with a heartfelt message about his passing.

'I’ve been trying to find the words, but nothing comes close to how I feel. I’ve been reflecting on every moment, every conversation, every laugh, every disagreement, every hug…everything. I wish we had more time,' Jordan began.

Jordan continued by stating how Boseman helped him along the way in the beginning of his career, 'starting with All My Children when I was 16 years old you paved the way for me.' 

'I’m dedicating the rest of my days to live the way you did. With grace, courage, and no regrets. “Is this your king!?” Yes . he . is! Rest In Power Brother,' Jordan concluded.

'How do I start to honor a man who I saw as a giant in many ways; with whom I thought I had so much more time,' Duke wrote. 'I am absolutely devastated by the loss of my friend and hero, Chadwick Boseman.'

Continuing: 'I feel sick ... I’m in pain and I can’t believe he’s gone. Chadwick was a lightning rod for me... he gave me direction..Thank you! Chadwick, you are the best...you are me and I’m you and we are all one!'

He added: 'You will NEVER be forgotten. Your heroism is now legend. We’ll carry the load and honor your legacy, the rest of the way! Bless King!'

In memory: Boseman's hometown of Anderson, South Carolina recently honored him with a memorial ceremony at an outdoor amphitheater and screening of his film Black Panther 

Boseman's hometown of Anderson, South Carolina recently honored him with a memorial ceremony at an outdoor amphitheater and screening of his film Black Panther.  

To take proper precautions with a public gathering amid the coronavirus pandemic, the amphitheater's capacity of 10,000 attendees was reduced to 50 percent capacity in an effort to create social distancing space.

In addition, an enshrinement of the talented actor will be built in the town, officials told the outlet. 

The news comes as a petition on Change.org amassed more than 16,431 signatures urging local officials to erect a statue of the late actor in place of a Confederate statue that remains on display in the city's downtown area.
