Bertrand Traore is to undergo his medical in Denmark ahead of finalising his £19million move to Aston Villa.

The Lyon winger has flown from France to Copenhagen where he will undergo medical tests and speak to Villa's Danish sporting director Johan Lange who is in his home country.

Traore, a Burkina Faso international, will also need a work permit, ahead of completing his move and meeting up with his new teammates at Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground.

 Aston Villa have agreed a £19million deal with French club Lyon to sign winger Bertrand Traore

The 25-year-old's signing will be a coup for Villa as there was plenty of interest in the former Chelsea winger. Indeed, Lange has overseen the addition of some top targets.

After Ollie Watkins was confirmed from Brentford, they gave Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez the hard sell on the club's history on Saturday to help convince him to join and have asked about a deal for Werder Bremen's attacking midfielder Milot Rashica too.

Werder Bremen’s head of football, Clemens Fritz, confirmed: 'They [Villa] have come forward, yes, I can confirm that. There is nothing concrete. There are a few requests for him. We are in intensive and close contact with his management.'

Villa are also still in the chase for Chelsea's Conor Gallagher and Liverpool's Rhian Brewster.

Manchester United are expected to make an attempt to sign Jack Grealish but Villa will hold out for a hefty fee.

The club expect Traore to undergo a medical on Monday ahead of signing a three year deal
