Megan Gale spent two weeks in hotel quarantine in August, after flying into Perth from Melbourne to attend her brother Jason Gale's funeral.

In an Instagram video on Monday, the model revealed how quarantine put her life into perspective, and shared advice for those isolating after the death of a loved one.

The 45-year-old advised going into quarantine with a 'super strong mindset' and allowing yourself to grieve after the mandatory two weeks.

'It gave me a lot of time to reflect upon my life, reassess things, think about what I prioritise now, what I don't, which a very dear loved one passing away will often do that,' Megan said of quarantine. 

The media personality went on to reveal how she discovered a newfound appreciation for the simple things in life.

'Appreciating things like fresh air and direct sunlight, I didn't have that for two weeks. I had a very basic, very small room with quite basic food and not much else.'

However, when watching old episodes of fiancé Shaun Hampson, 32, on Australian Survivor, Megan realised that despite being in quarantine, her life is pretty good.

Grateful: Megan went on to reveal how she discovered a newfound appreciation for the simple things in life: 'Having that attitude of gratitude and putting things in perspective, really helped me get through quarantine' 

'Having that attitude of gratitude and putting things in perspective, really helped me get through quarantine,' she said.

Megan, who shares son River, six, and daughter Rosie, two with Shaun, went on to share her advice for those entering quarantine after the death of a loved one.

'Try and focus on a super strong mindset before you go in. The only way I could get through it was to not think about what had happened to my brother,' she said.

Blocking out the pain: 'I couldn't allow myself to grieve and sink into that deep sadness in there, being locked in a room for two weeks,' she said 

Megan revealed that she 'broke twice', but 'shifted focus' and 'snapped' herself out of it, only allowing herself to grieve once she completed quarantine.

'I couldn't allow myself to grieve and sink into that deep sadness in there, being locked in a room for two weeks,' she said.   

Megan joined mourners on August 18 to farewell her brother at his funeral in Perth, four weeks after he was found dead in bushland. 

Jason, 49, was last seen at a petrol station on July 14 in Western Australia, and was found dead a week later in bushland next to his 1999 Honda CR-V SUV.
