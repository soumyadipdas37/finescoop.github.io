Mark Wright has jokingly been compared to Simon Cowell after posing in an unbuttoned shirt in a throwback snap. 

The former TOWIE star, 33, posted the picture which was taken at his mum Carol's 60th birthday party three years ago which had a 70s theme.

In the snap Mark donned a black shirt that was buttoned half way down as he posed alongside Carol and his sister Jess, 35.

He captioned the photo: 'What a weekend celebrating mums 60th !! @carolwright we couldn't love you anymore if we tried.

'Your kindness, your love and the fact that you ALWAYS put others first is what makes you so special. Happy birthday mum. Love you always xx'

But social media fans were quick to comment on the post, comparing him to X Factor judge Simon, 60, who is known for showing off his chest in daring unbuttoned shirts.

One eagle-eyed follower commented: 'Thought you were Simon Cowell at first...'.

While another wrote 'Legit thought this was Simon Cowell', as another penned: 'Going for the Simon Cowell look!!'

However others thought Mark looked more like John Travolta in the low-cut black shirt and that his mum Carol looked like Olivia Newton-John.

It comes after it was revealed that Michelle Keegan and husband Mark's £1.3 million dream home in Essex is reportedly near a dogging hot spot.

The Sun has claimed people who have engaged in outdoor sex in the rural area have boasted about their escapades online.

In July, the actress and presenter, both 33, had the country house demolished to create their own Georgian-style four bedroom mansion.

The publication alleged an advert on an adult site read: 'The countryside near ***** is good for dogging and flashing. Loads of secluded laybys and woods etc. Also on the golf course at night. Seen some couples putting on a show after dark. You've just gotta drop lucky.'

A man in his 40s reportedly wrote: 'Out with my female friend this weekend for fun and frolics in the ***** Lane area. Good-looking peeps only.'

Another site dedicated to outdoor sex just years away from the TV stars new property is believed to have had a post which read: 'Loads of places near ***** and Chelmsford for dogging and flashing – socially distanced of course. The woods near the end of the road are great. Plenty of cover so fun to be had.'

Not shy! People who have engaged in outdoor sex in the rural area have allegedly boasted about their escapades online (their property pictured before they demolished it)

Guidelines suggest you should remain socially distant from anyone in another household, remaining two metres apart where possible, or one metre with other measures.

A representative for Mark and Michelle declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. 

The duo bought the home for £1.3 million in October last year, and the project is being designed by Essex-based company MP Architects.
