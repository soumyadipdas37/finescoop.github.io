He split from his girlfriend Miley Cyrus in August after ten months of dating.

And on Tuesday, Cody Simpson showed the Wrecking Ball singer, 27, what she was missing as he flaunted his bulging biceps.

Cody's mother Angie shared a photo to Instagram of the Australian singer posing in red budgie smugglers after enjoying a swim.

The 23-year-old held a bag in his hands while he looked at the camera after jumping out of the pool.

In August, Miley confirmed her split from Cody after less than a year of dating in an Instagram video, telling fans the pair are taking time apart to 'work on' themselves. 

Referencing her split from ex-husband Liam Hemsworth in August 2019, Miley began: 'A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me, and control my narrative, and I'm just not accepting that.

'So today, it came out that me and my boyfriend have broken up,' she added.

She continued:'It was confirmed by a "reliable source" even though no one is reliable in a relationship except the individuals who are participating in it.' 

'We are just deciding who we wanna be in our lives, what we wanna do, and so, don't make it some drama story if next week we're hanging out, getting pizza,' she said.

The American singer went on to say she remains friends with Cody, who she's known for a decade.

'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not.'

The couple began dating in September 2019, shortly after Miley had ended her fling with U.S. reality star Kaitlynn Carter.

She was previously married to actor Liam Hemsworth, but they separated in August last year after just seven months of marriage.
