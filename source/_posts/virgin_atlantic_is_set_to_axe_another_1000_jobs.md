Virgin Atlantic is set to slash more than 1,000 jobs as it struggles to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

The British airline, based in Crawley, West Sussex, will reportedly announce the huge cull as early as tomorrow.

It comes just hours after Sir Richard Branson's firm had a £1.2billion rescue package approved by creditors.

And it is less than four months after Virgin Atlantic said it would close its headquarters at Gatwick and axed 3,150 jobs.

The news means the airline's workforce would have nearly halved since before Covid-19 struck, according to Sky News.
