Filming for Married At First Sight 2021 is currently underway in Sydney.

And on Wednesday, resident relationship expert Mel Schilling showcased her new hair transformation after she spent the last 14 days in mandatory hotel quarantine.

Uploading a photo to her Instagram, the 48-year-old psychologist appeared to be getting her hair coloured before she returned to set. 

Almost camera ready! On Wednesday, relationship expert Mel Schilling (pictured) got a full head of foils in preparation for the new season of Married At First Sight

'My own hair is extremely fine and I've got pregnancy hair loss,' she explained alongside the image of her with a full head of foils. 

'This is a ''halo'' piece called Amazing Secret,' she also jokingly wrote as she showed off her new hair extensions. 

Mel's makeover comes as after Channel Nine revealed the season eight cast of MAFS will be 'the most genuine yet'.

Channel Nine also claimed the new season will be about 'finding love not fame' as all the contestants are determined to find their potential match.

The new season will also star Alessandra Rampolla, a certified clinical sexologist with over 20 years' experience, who will join the show as an expert.

'I am thrilled to be joining John and Mel in Australia's biggest social experiment,' she said.

Alessandra added: 'With my particular expertise, I hope to contribute to the complex mix of components that ensure marriages not only work but thrive in the long haul.'

For the first time, the show's relationship experts were forced to meet the loved-up hopefuls via Zoom.

It's understood producers have decided not to cast any Victorians this season after the state recorded a spike in COVID-19 cases.
