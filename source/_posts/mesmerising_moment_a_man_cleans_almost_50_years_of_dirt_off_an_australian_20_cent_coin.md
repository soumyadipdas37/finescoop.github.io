The TikTok account features dozens of other videos, with coins from all over the globe receiving the same makeover.

The coins are released back into circulation after they're cleaned.  

The footage has proved extremely popular on the video-sharing app.

'This was so satisfying', one woman wrote. 

'I'm shocked to find out 20 cent coins are silver,' another said.

Others suggested they had wasted their time cleaning it by hand. 

'Next leave it in a can of coke overnight,' they said.
