Lisa Rinna was determined to prove that Denise Richards had an affair with Brandi Glanville during the third and final RHOBH reunion episode Wednesday on Bravo.

The 57[year-old actress brought her version of receipts to the season 10 reunion as evidence that Denise, 49, and Brandi, 47, had hooked up. 

In a shocking moment, Lisa held up a thick stack of text messages between the women, saying, 'I have 'em right here if you guys wanna go through 'em.'

'Wow. Wow. Wow,' moaned show newcomer Garcelle Beauvais, 53.

Denise maintained that she and Brandi were just 'acquaintances' and suggested that Brandi's screenshots of the text messages were different from her own.

'Hey, Rinna, you better be careful saying this, because yours will be shown, too,' she told her friend of 20 years.

'Are you threatening me?' Lisa asked.

'I'm telling you the truth,' Denise said. 'If you wanna play this game, we can do it.'

Reunion host Andy Cohen, 52, asked Denise if she would show her texts with Brandi for comparison's sake.

'Absolutely,' Denise affirmed. 'Is Rinna willing to let me show my text messages with her?'

Good question: Reunion host Andy Cohen, 52, asked Denise if she would show her texts with Brandi for comparison's sake

'It's not about me, and those are private,' Lisa whimpered, as Denise countered, 'It's not about me and Brandi… this is about me with all of you.'

She later softened a bit, wiping away a tear as she mourned a lost friendship. 

Lisa, however, was not done, alluding to an old rumor that Denise had 'stolen' actress Heather Locklear's husband Richard Sambora, 61, and once invited a hooker to dinner.

Andy had an important question, asking Lisa, 'If you were to do it over again, would you give Denise a heads-up about Brandi's accusation?'

'I wouldn't have had Denise not come on the show if I were to do it over again,' Lisa said, leading Dorit Kemsley, 44, to sigh, 'F***.'

As the show opened, the ladies were already sparring, with Denise angry at Teddi Mellencamp-Arroyave, 39, for asking her about Brandi in public.

Do over: 'I wouldn't have had Denise not come on the show if I were to do it over again,' Lisa told Andy

'Teddi, you are the daughter of a famous father,' Denise said. 'The fact that you would even bring that up in a group dinner, I think is really f***ing s***ty.'

When Lisa backed Teddi, Denise snapped, 'She said a lot about your family. Do you want me to throw that out there?'

Teddi asked Denise how she knew so much about Brandi if they weren't pals.

Sharp query: Teddi Mellencamp asked Denise how she knew so much about Brandi if they weren't pals

Denise clutched a drink and said, 'It was the first time I met her when I signed on to do the f***ing show through a mutual agent. She spilled—talked—diarrhea of the mouth. I never repeated it. That is the truth.'

The Starship Troopers actress explained that Brandi had called her 'out of the blue' and tagged along with her to Kyle Richards's black-and-white gala.

'Aaron was like, ''No f***ing way,'' which, I didn't even ask him…' she went on.

'He said ''No f***ing way,'' that he wouldn't even come, but you didn't even ask him?' Andy puzzled.

'No,' Denise said. 'He doesn't like Brandi. She's a trainwreck, and she's not stable, and she drinks a lot. The last time he saw her prior to Kyle's was when she asked to come do the podcast…'

Denise was referring to an event at which they were alleged to have hooked up, and said Aaron, 48, was there the whole time.

Together again: Dorit Kemsley, Sutton Stracke, Lisa, Kyle Richards, Denise, Teddi, Garcelle Beauvais and Erika Girardi gathered virtually for the season 10 reunion on Bravo

'I do not have an open marriage,' Denise declared. 'If I had an open marriage, I would say it.'

Kyle, 51, said Denise's behavior seemed dishonest, and Denise said she thought the whole discussion had been laid to rest during the cast's Rome trip, asking 'What happened after that?'

'You stopped showing up,' Kyle replied. 'You said. ''I'm not coming to the final party'',' you stood up Garcelle…'

Not honest: Kyle, 51, said Denise's behavior seemed dishonest, and Denise said she thought the whole discussion had been laid to rest during the cast's Rome trip

'I have to move on, or I'm gonna die,' Andy groaned.

New cast member Sutton Stracke spoke up. 'I didn't know Denise at all in 2018. But I did hear a rumor from one person that this was going on. So either Brandi is lying and she's been lying… or she has manipulated you and used you.'

Denise said she hadn't known Brandi in 2018, which Lisa said was untrue.

'The whole f***ing thing is about you and Brandi,' Lisa spat. 'Why? Is she being muzzled? Did you send a cease-and-desist to Brandi to shut her up?'

Andy told Denise, 'Your lawyer threatened to file a cease-and-desist against production.'

'No, no, no,' Denise said. 'The cease-and-desist was against Brandi, to make her tell the truth to all of you.'

Legal notice: 'No, no, no,' Denise said. 'The cease-and-desist was against Brandi, to make her tell the truth to all of you'

Andy then asked Lisa to imagine a scenario in which Denise had just been trying to protect her marriage, wondering 'What then?'

'I would think that if we were such good friends, she would have come to me and said, ''Lisa, this happened, please help me'',' Lisa suggested.

Garcelle laughed. 'How can she come to you? All you do is attack her every time you see her!'

Main subject: The affair allegations and the fractured friendship between Denise and Lisa dominated the final reunion episode

Denise swore that she had told the truth, and no one believed her anyway.

Andy said Bravo had hoped Aaron would show up to the reunion, and Denise explained that it would have been a 'no-win situation' for him.

The two of them had been filming her soap opera together lately; she and Aaron shared love scenes to preserve others' safety during the COVID-19 crisis.

No win: Andy said Bravo had hoped Aaron would show up to the reunion, and Denise explained that it would have been a 'no-win situation' for him

Teddi said that when she re-watched season 10, she was often 'uncomfortable' with the way Aaron spoke to Denise.

At one challenging party, for example, Denise dragged Aaron away to keep him quiet and he said he was 'going to crush' her 'f***ing hand.'

Denise said Aaron claimed not to remember saying it, and added, 'I don't know why I would say that, because I'm afraid of you.'

Show veteran: Kyle has been on RHOBH since its premiere in October 2010, while Denise was one and done after season 10

Lisa wondered why Aaron was afraid, and Denise said he had been joking.

Andy asked Denise how Lisa had changed over the course of their friendship.

'I need to eat something before I answer this question,' Denise said.

Meal break: 'I need to eat something before I answer this question,' Denise said

She then got up and walked off as the other women goggled.

'We're almost done, Denise,' Andy pleaded. 'We're almost done.'

Seconds later, Denise returned, high heels in hand, clutching a script.

'I'm done,' she said. 'I have to go to work tomorrow. I have 48 pages….'

Over it: 'I'm done,' she said. 'I have to go to work tomorrow. I have 48 pages….'

Denise emphasized to Andy that she had enjoyed doing the show and getting to know the other women, but she didn't like how Lisa had 'turned' on her.

Lise then recalled Denise's insistence that the RHOBH cast stop speaking about sex around her kids, and called her a 'hypocrite.'

Lisa noted that Denise once invited a prostitute dating her ex, Charlie Sheen, to Thanksgiving dinner.

 Called out: Lise then recalled Denise's insistence that the RHOBH cast stop speaking about sex around her kids, and called her a 'hypocrite.'

'Shame on me for asking her to come in for a square meal,' Denise shrugged.

Lisa argued again that Denise and Brandi couldn't just be 'acquaintances,' saying she couldn't 'reconcile' it with their texts.

'Remember those words,' Denise warned. 'You told me a lot of stuff about her.'

Relationship debate: Lisa argued again that Denise and Brandi couldn't just be 'acquaintances,' saying she couldn't 'reconcile' it with their texts

Lisa admitted she didn't like Brandi, but said she wanted to give her a chance.

She wondered why Denise hadn't called Brandi to talk right away, and Denise said there was no need for them to hash it out.

Denise and Lisa hadn't spoken or texted in six months, and Lisa bristled at the suggestion that she'd somehow been a bad friend.

'You know, I go back to when she was friends with Heather Locklear...' Lisa mused.

Not talking: The reunion revealed that Lisa and Denise have not talked in months

'She was friends with my ex-husband,' Denise seethed. 'Really?'

Andy was desperate to be clued in, and Lisa urged him to Google it.

As the Daily Mail revealed on Tuesday, actress Heather, 58, claimed Denise stole her husband away from her in 2006.

No clue: Andy was desperate to be clued in, and Lisa urged him to Google it.

Asked if she would have changed anything about the season, Lisa said no.

Andy lamented the state of Lisa and Denise's friendship, recounting how Lisa had once encouraged him to cast the former Wild Things star.

Denise wiped away tears, saying she'd come to the reunion hoping to resolve things with the cast, but 'some of the women don't want to do that.'

Elsewhere on the show, Andy took questions from callers.

One asked Lisa why she wouldn't let her daughter Amelia Gray, 19, be a go-go dancer, since she already parades 'half-nude on Instagram.'

'Well, gosh,' Lisa said. 'I guess there really isn't any difference, is there?'

'[She makes] a lot more money, that's the difference,' joked Erika Girardi, 49.

Caller questions: Elsewhere on the show, Andy took questions from callers.

Erika had just done a Broadway run as Roxie Hart in Chicago, which Andy said was attended by singer Janet Jackson, designer Marc Jacobs and other fans.

Because of the COVID-19 epidemic, the show shut down early, and Erika's husband, Tom Girardi, 81, never saw it.

Most of her castmates had, though, with Dorit flying from Mexico to get there.

Denise said she hadn't gone because she hadn't known about it in time, to which Andy said, 'I was told that it was at the time you were suing us.'

'I wasn't suing anybody,' Denise insisted. 'I sent a cease-and-desist to Brandi, and we also sent something to Bravo to ask if they could remove the footage because she was not a cast member, and it wasn't true.'

Garcelle claimed she didn't go because she was 'deathly scared of small planes,' then confessed she'd had to work and watch her kids.

As the show ended, the cast raised a glass to each other in a toast.

'May the only pain in your life be champagne,' Dorit declared, shaking her Gucci glass full of Gucci ice cubes.
