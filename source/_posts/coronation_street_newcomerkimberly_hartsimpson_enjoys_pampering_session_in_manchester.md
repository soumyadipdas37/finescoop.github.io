Yet things have recently taken a sinister turn as Daniel has been asking Nicky to wear Sinead's clothes and perfume.  

Only recently, Kimberly revealed she has been trying to get a role on Coronation Street for ten years.

She told Inside Soap: 'My first ever audition for Coronation Street was probably about 10 years ago, when I'd just finished drama school. I completely over-acted!

'I was so hammy because I couldn't understand the difference between doing theatre and TV.'

She added: 'But with the role of Nicky, I only auditioned once – I just walked into the room and thought, "I'm having this one!"'

Kimberly sweetly added that it was her late father's dream for her to secure a role on the cobbles.

She told The Sun: 'Unfortunately, I lost my dad in 2007. One of the last things he said to me was, "Just do me a favour and get on Corrie, love." We had that shared ­connection with it.'

Newcomer! Kimberly will no doubt be enjoying an afternoon of pampering after joining the cobbles as escort Nicky Wheatley (pictured on the soap)
