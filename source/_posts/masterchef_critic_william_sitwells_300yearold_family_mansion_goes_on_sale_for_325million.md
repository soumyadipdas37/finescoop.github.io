It's been in his family for 300-years and comes complete with lavish gardens, a swimming pool and tennis court, so it's perhaps of little surprise that MasterChef critic William Sitwell appears reluctant to part with his 'paradise' mansion - which is on sale for £3.25million.

The Sitwells were once among the most celebrated of British society families, with their much-loved Northamptonshire manor house, Grade II-listed Weston Hall at Weston, near Towcester, proving to be the perfect place to host glamorous parties.

In the family’s heyday in the Twenties and Thirties, Brideshead author Evelyn Waugh, English playwright Noel Coward and society photographer Cecil Beaton often stayed. 

But now, the late-17th-century stone house, which stands in 49 acres of gardens and woodland, has gone on the market through Knight Frank, with William and his brother, baronet and film producer Sir George deciding to sell Weston Hall.

Reflecting on the sale of his home (pictured), William, 51, said: 'Given my personal attachment to Weston Hall, and my family’s link to the property since 1714, saying goodbye is terribly sad and a wrench, but whoever the future owner is will find that it’s wonderful in so many ways'

'It’s the perfect house because it’s not too big and not too small, with a beautiful garden, and accessible to London in not much more than an hour despite its remote and rural location. 

'It’s not just the four walls of bricks and mortar on offer to the buyer, there is also a wonderful spirit and atmosphere to the place - which I’m sure will be cherished by the future owner. 

'As well as being a treasure trove of English social history, Weston Hall has an amazing local community and a pub only 30 seconds away. If it were not for our financial set up, I would stay at Weston Hall forever, because it is paradise.'

William Sitwell, who has appeared on the BBC's MasterChef as a food critic, is the former editor of Waitrose Food magazine and a great-nephew of avant garde poet Dame Edith Sitwell. 

Four years ago William separated from his first wife, society girl Laura McCorquodale, by whom he had two children, in favour of Emily Lopes, daughter of the late Devonshire race-horse breeder the 3rd Lord Roborough.

They married in 2017 and called Weston Hall their home.  Emily’s cousin, Harry Lopes, is married to Laura Parker Bowles, daughter of the Duchess of Cornwall. 

William's brother George used to live at Weston with Martha de Blank, daughter of late gastronome Justin de Blank, after marrying her in 2007. But Martha walked out five years later.

'It’s the perfect house because it’s not too big and not too small, with a beautiful garden, and accessible to London in not much more than an hour despite its remote and rural location', William said. Pictured is an outside space at the property

Inside, there’s an array of rooms that capture English social history - including an 18th-century library (pictured), a 17th-century Justice Room and a vibrant dining room painted purple by William’s mother

The wonderfully private 10-bedroom, five-bathroom home boasts a two-bedroom lodge, stabling, a coach house, tennis court (pictured) and various outbuildings

With a reception hall, five reception rooms and four bedroom suits (pictured is one of them), the country home is perfect for both large-scale entertaining and more intimate occasions with family and friends
