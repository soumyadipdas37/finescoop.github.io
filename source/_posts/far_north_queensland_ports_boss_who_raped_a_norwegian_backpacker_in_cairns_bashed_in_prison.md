A highly-paid businessman who raped a drunken backpacker he picked up walking home has been brutally bashed in prison.  

Alan George Vico, 54, was hospitalised with multiple facial fractures following the violent incident and required surgery.

Vico use to command a $290,000 annual salary while working for Ports North in Far North Queensland before his arrest.

He is now serving a five and a half year jail sentence at the Lotus Glen Correctional Centre west of Cairns where the assault took place on September 17.

Vico was jailed in the Cairns District Court last month following the opportunistic rape of a Norwegian backpacker in September 2018.

A Queensland Corrective Services spokesman confirmed the bashing remains under investigation.

'QCS (Queensland Corrective Services) can confirm a prisoner in his 50s was transferred to hospital on September 17 after being assaulted by another prisoner,' he told the Cairns Post.

'He is being treated for facial injuries and remains in hospital.

'The matter will be reviewed by CSIU (Corrective Services Investigation Unit).' 

Vico has formally launched an appeal against his conviction and sentence, arguing the outcome from the judge-only trial was 'manifestly excessive'. 

A jury could not be used due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Judge Julie Dick reserved her decision for more than two months before finding Vico guilty in late August.

She ordered he serve half of his sentence before being eligible for parole.

Court documents revealed Vico picked up the highly intoxicated female tourist on the side of the road in his car in Cairns North two years ago before driving her to a nearby hotel in Earlville.

The 20-year-old woke up naked and alone the next morning, unaware how she made her to the motel. 

The woman, who cannot be named, then discovered an empty condom packet and a $20 note on the bedside table.

Vico took the used condoms from the motel room, which were later found by police in his bin at home. 

DNA from Vico and the victim was discovered on the discarded condoms. A date for Vico's appeal is still to be determined.
