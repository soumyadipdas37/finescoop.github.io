'Technically, actually, not anymore, but I was. I was in my old room,' admitted Washington with a wide grin.

'But you still had to do chores, though, right? Because I know Denzel likes some order in the house,' quipped Jackson. 

'I can't believe we're doing this right now,' said Washington, as he rubbed his face. 'There was a chore or two. My chore was to make sure I'm down for dinner in time.'
