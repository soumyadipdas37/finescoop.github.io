In the midst of an unprecedented time in America, legal journalist and victims rights advocate Nancy Grace is using her crime-fighting expertise to help people ensure that they don't fall prey to criminals.

Nancy covers 'every aspect' of staying safe in her latest book, Don't Be a Victim: Fighting Back Against America's Crime Wave, and exclusively spoke about the project with DailyMailTV. 

And, as part of her tireless mission to protect children, the New York Times best-selling author is giving all proceeds from the book to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

'I don't just report on cases, I try to solve cases,' Nancy said of her inspiration to pen the new book. 'Especially right now in a world full of uncertainly. A lot of people feel very powerless but you don't have to feel that way.' 

Don't Be A Victim took two years to research during which Grace tapped into every single case that she's worked on throughout her career from a prosecutor all the way up to today.

Through those stories, Nancy offers hundreds of practical tips for readers to be empowered to get proactive in the face of whatever dangers may be out there. 

'I don't want people to go through life unaware of what is happening around them which makes them a potential target,' she explained.  

'I don't just report on cases, I try to solve cases,' Nancy said of her inspiration to pen the new book. 'Especially right now in a world full of uncertainly. A lot of people feel very powerless but you don't have to feel that way.'

The book is intended to shine a light on potential threats around people every singleday and help ensure that neither the readers or their families become victims. 

Nancy summed her approach to the wide world of dangers: 'Every chapter in the book relates to true cases and then I decipher: What can we do about it?' 

The true crime expert covers the gamut of dangers between COVID-19 scams, assaults, car-jacking, home invasions, online stalking, computer hackers, travel safety, cruise ship safety, elevator safety and even shopping - just to name a few.

Her chapter on RV safety was born out of research she did on a recent family trip from Atlanta to Yellow Stone with husband David Linch and their twins, John David and Lucy.

'I used every safety tip possible,' she recalled. Adding that it makes her happier knowing she's doing everything in her power to keep her family safe. 

Not only is the best-selling author calling on her own years of professional experience enmeshed in the world of crime, but she's also tragically seen it first hand from the victims perspective.  

When Nancy was a college student her fiance Keith was murdered before their wedding. 

'Everything went sideways when my fiance was murdered,' Nancy recalled. 'Up until that point I knew nothing about hate and violence.'

'When Keith was murdered all that changed and my world exploded,' she continued. 'I soon dedicated my life to being a crime fighter and hopefully protecting people from going through what Keith and his family went through.' 

The Atlanta native said that through her work she would hear stories over and over and over again about people being victimized in dozens of ways and she started compiling 'literally hundreds of ideas and tips about how to stay safe.' 

'Women would go missing in their cars,' she would think. 'Why is that?'

'I used every safety tip possible,' she recalled. Adding that it makes her happier knowing she's doing everything in her power to keep her family safe.

To answer those questions Nancy dedicated a lot of time and research to figuring out what people do or don't do that leave them vulnerable. And, she didn't only use her own legal mine and experiences but sourced help from 'experts around the world.'

'My friends had been gunned down because a female sheriff had been overpowered in an elevator,' she said, illustrating one of those real life examples. The incident led Nancy to researching and putting together an entire chapter on elevator safety.  

Among her hundreds of tips, the TV host says there are several small things people can do right at home, right now to protect themselves. Things that are simple but potentially life saving like changing the factory codes on garage door openers or nanny cams. 

'Crime is evolving and we have to evolve along with it,' Grace said. 'There are people out there that spend their whole day trying to hack your computers.' 

Nancy is careful to caution that protecting yourself and your family doesn't mean anyone should be living in a state of constant fear. Actually, she revealed that being aware of the dangers and the methods to thwart them should have the opposite effect. 

'Don't Be a Victim is not to scare anyone - it's to empower you,' she said. 'It is a way of life where you're actually much less afraid of the world around you because you're taking the power. You're the one proactively fighting back.'

In addition to helping the readers with real world tips to protect themselves, the proceeds from Don't Be a Victim: Fighting Back Against America's Crime Wave are being donated to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

The nonprofit organization, established in 1984 by the U.S. Congress, is the leading resource center for assisting in the finding of missing children, and works to raise awareness about how to prevent child abduction, abuse and exploitation. 

'They've been a big part of my mission of protecting our children,' Nancy said. Back in 2011 when she was a contestant on season 13 of Dancing With the Stars, Nancy also donated that money to the NCMEC.

'They have so much hard work to do. They are protecting our most vulnerable and our weakest members of our society that have no voice,' Grace said. 'They're fighting the good fight and I do not believe I can stand by and do nothing to help them. If you stand by and do nothing you're part of the problem.'

Never one to stand by or be silent on an issue, Nancy is turning her signature brand of on-camera crime-fighting towards the upcoming season of her television series.

'I'm thrilled about season two of Injustice on Oxygen. We cover the cases that are happening now – cases to which I want answers,' she said.

National Center for Missing and Exploited Children: 'They've been a big part of my mission of protecting our children. They are protecting our most vulnerable and our weakest members of our society that have no voice.'

On her true crime show, Nancy demands answers in cases 'where judges or incompetent, where witnesses lied, where there were fumbling of justice that result in injustice.'

'I want justice,' she said switching her tone to the instantly recognizable, television's-Nancy-Grace-fervor. 'What is happening at Fort. Hood? Why are so many minorities going missing and turning up dead at Fort Hood?'

In the last year there have been 28 deaths at Fort Hood and Congress recently launched an investigation into Texas Army post.

'What these people have gone through and suffered is overwhelming and what makes it worse – to rub salt in the wound – is that Fort Hood is engaging in a cover-up. I know that for a fact,' Nancy said. 

Nancy served as a Special Prosecutor working on felony cases in the Atlanta-Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney's for nearly a decade. 

After leaving the prosecutor's office, Nancy pivoted to a wildly successful television career, first joining up with Johnnie Cochran and Court TV in 1996. In 2005 she launched her eponymous award-winning HLN series.

The legal mind has also authored several books.Her first,  Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal Justice System, is a New York Times bestseller. 

Her fiction book, The Eleventh Victim, is also a bestseller and was turned in the Hallmark Channel's popular Hailey Dean Mysteries series. She also hosts the podcast Crime Stories with Nancy Grace on SiriusXM.  

Season two of Injustice with Nancy Grace premieres October 8 at 9/8c on Oxygen and her new 20 episode  true crime series Bloodline Detectives premieres October 3rd. Don't Be a Victim: Fighting Back Against America's Crime Wave is available now.
