On Monday night's episode of The Masked Singer Australia, musical theatre star Lucy Durack was unveiled as the Cactus.   

And the 37-year-old revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Tuesday there was one song she didn't want to sing without her mask on. 

The Wicked star explained that she was glad that she wasn't eliminated after her performance of I Touch Myself last week, because she would have been too nervous to sing the tune without her costume on at the end of the episode.  

Nerves: On Tuesday, Lucy Durack (pictured) told The Kyle and Jackie O Show there was one song she didn't want to sing without her mask on

'You said you were so glad you didn't go out last week 'cause you didn't want to have to sing I Touch Myself with the head off,' commented radio host and The Masked Singer judge Jackie 'O' Henderson. 

The mother-of-two agreed, saying: 'That's very true, I was like, "Oh my God, I'm not sure I have the confidence to sing this song not in a mask."'

She even admitted that she was worried about practicing the song at home in case her eldest daughter Polly, five, heard her. 

Setting an example: Lucy admitted that she was worried about practicing the song at home in case her eldest daughter Polly (pictured), five, heard her and sang it at kindy

'I practiced a lot at home and my daughter, Polly, was listening to me,' she said. 

'But I didn't practice I Touch Myself at home 'cause I was worried she was going to learn it and sing it at kindy.' 

Thankfully, Lucy made it through to the next round and didn't have to sing the racy Divinyls' tune without her cactus costume.

However, she was sadly voted out on Monday night's episode following her performance of Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart. 

Lucy wasn't at all upset at being voted out, jumping up and down and beaming when she pulled off the mask.   

'When you're behind the mask, it's so much fun 'cause you've kind of got this freedom to just have a go,' she said on the program.  

The Masked Singer continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
