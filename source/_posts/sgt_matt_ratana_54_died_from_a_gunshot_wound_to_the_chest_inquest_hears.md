Metropolitan Police Sergeant Matt Ratana died from a gunshot wound to the chest, his inquest heard today. 

The 54-year-old was shot as he was preparing to search a handcuffed suspect who had managed to smuggle a revolver into the custody suite in Croydon, south London last month. 

But they are yet to speak to the alleged gunman, Louis De Zoysa, 23, who is in a critical condition in hospital after he shot himself as he opened fire.
