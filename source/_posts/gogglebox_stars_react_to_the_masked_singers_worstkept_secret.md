Sophie Monk's unveiling as Dragonfly on The Masked Singer was hardly a surprise for viewers who had been paying attention to the clues.

And the cast of Gogglebox weren't exactly shocked by the big reveal either.

The couch critics watched Sophie being unmasked on Thursday's episode, and Isabelle Silbery couldn't resist shouting out: 'Ah! Knew it!'

The guessing game also seemed to be a bit too easy for the others.

Art dealer Mick Kershaw, who watched the show with his wife, Di, confidently said: 'I reckon it's Sophie Monk.'

Newcomer Chantel Bakac told her housemate Kaday Kamara that the Dragonfly 'has the same figure' as Sophie.

Keith made a similar observation: 'She hasn't got a bad figure, though, whoever it is.'

Never would have thought! The former Bardot singer's big reveal left a couple of the Goggleboxers shocked, including Tim Lai (pictured)

'Not that I'm looking at it. I just meant the wings and the hat and that,' he clarified to his wife, Lee.

During Dragonfly's performance of Kesha's TikTok, the households couldn't help but mimic her singing and dance moves.

After the big reveal, Anastasia Katselas said: 'Sophie, I don't know why they picked you - you were great!'

Too easy! The guessing game also seemed to be a tad too easy for others, including art dealer Mick Kershaw, 77, who watched the show with his wife Di, 74, confidently said: 'I reckon it's Sophie Monk'. Pictured left is Mick with Di

Matty Fahd also pointed out: 'This is actually the first time we haven't had to Google who was under the mask.'

Meanwhile, the Elias family's eldest son, Jacob, applauded: 'Someone we know!'
