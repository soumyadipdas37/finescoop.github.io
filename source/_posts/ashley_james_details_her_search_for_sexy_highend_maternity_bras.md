She also explained how in the past she has been judged for having bigger boobs which attracted 'unwanted attention'.

In the emotional post the former Made In Chelsea star penned: 'Let's talk pregnancy & boobs. So after having a bit of a meltdown today after a bra fitting I wanted to talk about my experience with big boobs and pregnancy...

'Because after talking about it on stories it made me feel like I wasn't alone. So if you relate, you're not alone. I first discovered I was pregnant at only 2 weeks because my boobs were so painful...

'For my entire first trimester they felt so painful I could barely move, I had to invest in a sleep bra, and they felt swollen and uncomfortable.'
