Brooke Burke showed off her sensational summer body when she was spotted out and about in Los Angeles this week.

The 49-year-old dancing queen flashed her chiseled midriff as she pounded the pavement with one of her adult daughters.

She shares her elder two daughters by her first husband, Extreme Makeover plastic surgeon Garth Fisher - Neriah, 20, and Sierra, 18.

When she was spotted out and about that day Brooke was ab fab in a black bra-lette and emphasized her dancer's gams in leggings.

She was California chic in a fashionably torn denim jacket and slipped into a pair of silver sneakers that glinted in the sunlight.

Sweeping her hair into an updo, she accessorized with a snappy pair of shades and slung a gold purse from one arm.

Brooke rang in her latest birthday just last week at the Kardashian hot spot Nobu Malibu with her beau Scott Rigsby.

The mother of four went red carpet official with her new man last November, bringing him to the Beverly Hilton for Operation Smile’s Hollywood Fight Night.

She gushed to People that her children from her two marriages 'really like him,' adding: 'It is awesome because he is a great father.' 

The Connecticut native, who shot to fame hostessing Wild On!, dished: 'He has two children and that is one of the things that I love most about him. He is really kind and responsible and devoted, so our kids are getting to know each other.'

Brooke recently finalized her divorce from her second husband David Charvet, with whom she shares her daughter Heaven, 13, and son Shaya, 12.

Their divorce proceedings were finished up in early March, shortly before the coronavirus lockdowns began.

They each footed the bill for their own legal fees, neither is paying alimony or child support and they have joint custody of the children, People reported.

Brooke married her latest husband David, a French singer and Baywatch star in 2011, after they welcomed their two children.

She filed for divorce in April 2018 and last year explained their co-parenting equation to Us Weekly: 'We have a beautiful relationship right now, which is really valuable.'
