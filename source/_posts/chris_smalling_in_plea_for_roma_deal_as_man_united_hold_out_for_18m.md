Chris Smalling is growing frustrated at Manchester United over the club’s transfer wrangle with Roma. 

United value Smalling at £18million and are waiting for Roma to return with an improved offer.

The defender, 30, is training on his own twice a day at Carrington after coming back from a season on loan at the Italian club.

The former England centre back believes United should be doing more to give him the move he wants. Smalling has been at Old Trafford since a £10m transfer from Fulham in 2010.

However, United are refusing to budge on their valuation at a time when they need to generate as much money as possible to finance new signings.

Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer must sell a defender before he can buy a new one, as United haggle with Porto over left back Alex Telles, who has a £36.6m release clause in his contract.

Marcos Rojo is following a similar training regime to Smalling, with United willing to listen to offers for the Argentina centre back, as well as for goalkeeper Sergio Romero and midfielder Andreas Pereira.
