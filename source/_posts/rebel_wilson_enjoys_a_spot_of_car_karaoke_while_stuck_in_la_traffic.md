Rebel Wilson commands attention on screen. 

But the 40-year-old actress also knows how to turn heads in traffic, as demonstrated by her car karaoke skills on Monday.

Rebel honed her vocal skills while stuck on a busy Los Angeles commute, and shared footage of her singalong to Instagram.

Rebel looked relaxed as she sat and danced in the front seat of her 4WD, belting out the Bruno Mars song 24K Magic. 

She dressed casually in a blue Nike sweatshirt, which she paired with oversized cat-eye sunglasses. 

The comedian wore her blonde hair in a ponytail pushed to one side.

It comes as Rebel continues her incredible body transformation. 

The star has declared 2020 her 'year of health', and has lost at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone) so far. 

Earlier this month, she drew attention to her shrinking frame while posing for a photo shared with her 8.6 million Instagram followers.

She revealed a glimpse of cleavage and her slimmed-down waist in a white top and black pants, as she posed at her home in Los Angeles. 

Rebel added a chic red cardigan and white loafers to the look, and swept her blonde locks into a sleek high ponytail.

She was wearing minimal makeup, allowing her natural beauty to shine through.

'I made a new friend today x thanks Aunty Hilary,' Rebel captioned the photo, which showed a friend's dog resting its paw on her leg.

Rebel recently returned to Los Angeles, after spending several weeks in her home city of Sydney, Australia.
