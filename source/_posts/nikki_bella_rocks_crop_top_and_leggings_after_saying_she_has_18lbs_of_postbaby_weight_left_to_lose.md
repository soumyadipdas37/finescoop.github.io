Nikki Bella was spotted emerging from her car to fill up her tank at a Los Angeles gas station on Thursday.

The 36-year-old former WWE star cut a casual figure in a crop top and a pair of high-waisted black leggings.

The athlete made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown six weeks after giving birth to her son Matteo.

At the start of the week she posted an Instagram video showing her post-baby body and declaring she had 18lbs left to lose to reach her weight before getting pregnant. 

She attributed some of her weight gain to diet as well saying: 'I indulged in pizza quite a bit especially towards the end and baked goods.'

The retired wrestler explained: 'I have to take full accountability, so I am now in a journey to lose 18 pounds, but in the most healthiest way possible because I’m breastfeeding obviously, and giving my son the most amazing nutrition is No. 1, so there’s going to be no crash-diets, no starving myself.'

Nikki shares her firstborn child with her fiance Artem Chigvintsev who rose to fame as a pro hoofer on Dancing With The Stars.

She gave birth to her little pride and joy just one day before her twin sister and fellow ex-WWE star Brie Bella delivered her own son Buddy.

Brie and her husband Daniel Bryan, another professional fighter, share a three-year-old daughter called Birdie along with their newborn.

Looking ahead: At the start of the week she posted an Instagram video showing her post-baby body and declaring she had 18lbs left to lose to reach her weight before getting pregnant 

While Nikki stepped out in her car Brie posted a heartwarming picture of baby Buddy lying on the floor next to Birdie who was assembling a Lego tower.

'This makes me sooo happy,' wrote Brie, who went into joint lockdown with Daniel, Birdie, Nikki and Artem during her pregnancy. 

'I've been up since 3 a.m., but this is what I've wanted my whole life. The fact that he's here - I'm just so in love and happy,' Nikki told People last month. 

So sweet: Nikki and Brie covered the new issue of People cradling their new baby boys after giving birth within a day of each other
