Tom Hanks returned to Australia earlier this month to resume filming on Baz Lurhmann's Elvis Presley biopic.

On Tuesday, the Hollywood superstar looked like any other local as he took in a spot of shopping at Pacific Fair in Broadbeach, Queensland. 

The 64-year-old emerged from a 14-day mandatory quarantine and appeared in excellent spirits. 

Out and about: Tom Hanks (pictured) looked like any other local as he took in a spot of shopping at Pacific Fair in Broadbeach, Queensland, on Tuesday 

Tom dressed down in an Adidas tracksuit, consisting of a pair of pants with the iconic design of three white stripes down the side. 

He added a matching, long-sleeved, zip-up top from the same set, also in a black and white tone. 

Underneath, the Big actor opted for a simple black t-shirt, and he added a pale green and white cap to the ensemble.  

Free man! The 64-year-old emerged from a 14-day mandatory quarantine and appeared in excellent spirits

Shopping: The friendly A-lister waved merrily as he entered the local shopping centre to pick up some goods

The friendly A-lister waved merrily as he entered the local shopping centre to pick up some goods. 

He was flanked by what appeared to be two assistants or friends, and mingled cheerfully
