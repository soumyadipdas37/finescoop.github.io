Zendaya has been known to serve some major looks on red carpets, amid her meteoric rise to fame.

But the Emmy nominee has proven she doesn't need an A-list Hollywood event to deliver some glam.

She was pure beauty in braids Monday, as she took to Instagram with set of gorgeous selfies, taken in a lush green locale during the Labor Day weekend.

Zendaya will soon appear in Dune, the first of a planned two-part adaptation of the 1965 science fiction novel of the same name by Frank Herbert.

The novel has previously been adapted for the big screen by director David Lynch in 1984, before it was made into a miniseries for the Sci Fi Channel in 2000.

Zendaya recently nabbed her first Emmy nomination for her leading role as Rue Bennett in the HBO teen drama series Euphoria. 

She told Deadline of the exciting news: 'It’s like one of those out-of-body things, where it’s like, is this even really happening to me?

'It still feels very, very surreal. I don’t know if it will feel like it’s real life. ‘This isn’t happening to me. This is happening to somebody else.'
