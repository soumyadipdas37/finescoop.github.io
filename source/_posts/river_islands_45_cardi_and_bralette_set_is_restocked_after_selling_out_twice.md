A knit twinset might be one of your grandmother's wardrobe staples, but River Island claims it is the must-have for fashionistas this summer. 

The high street retailer is stocking a cosy button-up cardi complete with knit detailing and slouchy sleeves with gathered cuffs. 

But unlike a traditional twinset, this one is sold with a midriff-baring crop top in matching fabric.  

The £45 set comes in two colours, lilac and cream, and is proving an unlikely hit with shoppers.

River Island reports how it has sold out twice online and is now back in stock. 

The store revealed it is planning to expand the range by adding pink and black colourways. 

A spokesperson for River Island said: 'The knitted cardigan and bralette set has been one of our most popular pieces of the season.

'Having sold out twice already, and being a firm favourite among influencers and customers we've brought it back in stock again.

'The set has multiple ways to wear and is definitely a wardrobe staple. They have been so popular in the lilac and beige colourways, we are due to launch three extra colours over the next few weeks.' 

Influencers who've been spotted wearing the must-have include Nicole Heffernan from Sussex, who has over 3,000 followers on Instagram.

She teamed the piece with a camel coloured skirt for a casual look, racking up hundreds of likes.

Meanwhile trendsetter Katie Penny, who lives in Essex, opted to pair the cream version of the set with leather bottoms.

She impressed her 28,000 followers with the combination that looks ideal for a dinner date, with many gushing about it being 'cute'.

Elsewhere, model Lucy Moore paired the cream cardigan and bralette set with denim jeans and a green fedora hat for a more relaxed outfit.
