They've just shocked fans by revealing that their romance started by them having a workplace affair. 

And now Grant and Chezzi Denyer have spoken about the early days of dating, revealing the 'riskiest' place they ever had sex as they tried to keep their relationship under wraps. 

Speaking on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Tuesday, the pair said that they once did the deed in the back of a car at a race track.

'We were in a back of a car... it was a car in a car park. I think it was pretty seedy,' Grant said.

Chezzi said it was 'in the back seat of a car in a car park at a race track.'

The cheeky confession came as the pair played the 'cost of love' game on the show, where they had to answer revealing questions.

During the show, Chezzi was also asked if she ever worries that Grant will cheat on her, seeing as their relationship started by having a workplace affair. 

Despite the fact their relationship started with infidelity, Chezzi, 41, said she was confident that Grant, 43, would never stray now they have two children together and another on the way.

Radio host Kyle Sandilands asked: 'Chezzi, when Grant goes off to do his other TV stuff and comes home now you're not his producer, do you smell his [private parts] or something to make sure he's not still doing the same things?' 

He added: 'There's got to be some level of worry in there.'

Without missing a beat, Chezzi replied that she trusted Grant through and through.

'I don't feel worried at all, [and] he's away a lot,' Chezzi said, adding: 'I don't feel worried at all... I have to unpack his bag.'

On their It's All True podcast earlier this month, Chezzi revealed that she and Grant had started dating when they were both with other people.

'It was a rough journey - it wasn't like what you see in the movies,' said Chezzi, who was Grant's producer on Sunrise when he joined the program as a weatherman. 

When they first got together, Chezzi was married to another man, and Grant was dating another woman.

'It was problematic; it took a long time to navigate,' Grant said.

Working together complicated matters, as Seven executives were convinced that Chezzi was leaking stories about the pair to the press.

She feared the network would send her off to Cairns or Townsville as a punishment, but instead she decided to leave television altogether.

'In the end I left TV. I couldn't deal with it. My parents were petrified. I basically ran away and moved back to Bathurst,' she said.

The Denyers did not confirm their relationship for a while, and even Grant's family didn't know how serious things were between them. 

But everything changed when Grant broke his back in a monster truck accident in 2008.

'At the time we hadn't confirmed our relationship,' Chezzi said. 'Grant's family didn't know about me, but we had been living together for three months.'

Grant's mother apparently didn't want the couple living together, fearing Chezzi was a 'gold digger', but they persevered nonetheless.

Chezzi remained by Grant's side every step of the way during his recovery, and they ended up marrying in 2010.

They share two daughters, Sailor, eight, and Scout, four, and Chezzi recently confirmed she was pregnant with their third child.
