Phoebe wore a white linen shirt dress with floral embroidery, accessorising with a pair of clear-rimmed non-prescription reading glasses. 

Her blonde locks were styled semi-straight, and her makeup was glamorous. 

'My non-glasses, glasses are the perfect pairing to simplify any of my louder outfit combos,' Phoebe told fans in the post's caption.

'The crystal clear trend brings a certain sophistication while the keyhole bridge throws it back for a vintage vibe.

'Who would have guessed that acetate plastic could be so chic?!' she continued.
