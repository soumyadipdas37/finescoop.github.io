Swansea City have agreed to sell Kosovo international Bersant Celina to French Ligue 1 club Dijon with the former Manchester City playmaker expected to complete his £3million move in France on Wednesday.

Celina, 23, spent two years at The Liberty Stadium but has been sacrificed by manager Steve Cooper because of financial restrictions at the Championship club.

The skilful forward, who can operate at No10 or wide, played for Kosovo in their Nations League defeat against Greece on Sunday before negotiating a four-year deal with Dijon who have lost both their league games this season.

Celina played four times for City and spent a loan spell in Holland with FC Twente before joining Swansea.

He became a firm favourite in south Wales and scored against City in their 2019 FA Cup run to the quarter-finals.

However, his fortunes dipped after Cooper replaced Graham Potter as manager and a deal was seen in the best interests of all parties.
