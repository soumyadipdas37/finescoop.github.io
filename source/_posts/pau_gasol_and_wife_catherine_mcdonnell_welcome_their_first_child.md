Los Angeles Lakers power forward Pau Gasol welcomed his first child on Sunday, who he named after his late teammate Kobe Bryant's daughter.

Gasol, 40, took to Instagram on Sunday afternoon, sharing photos of his wife Catherine McDonnell and their child Elisabet Gianna Gasol.

Their daughter's middle name is named after Gianna Bryant, the 13-year-old daughter of Gasol's Laker teammate Kobe Bryant, who both passed away tragically in a helicopter crash in January.
