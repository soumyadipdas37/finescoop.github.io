Jack Wilshere is open to playing abroad as he tries to get his injury-ravaged career back on track following two frustrating years at West Ham.

The midfielder has played a mere 837 minutes in 19 games for the Hammers since arriving from Arsenal in 2018 with ankle and groin injuries taking a heavy toll.

Despite completing 90 minutes against Hull City in the Carabao Cup in midweek, after Josh Cullen tested positive for Covid-19, Hammers manager David Moyes has made clear Wilshere isn't part of his plans.

But the 28-year-old, who had returned to full fitness before the pandemic struck in March, is open-minded about his next challenge.

'I just want to play games and get back to the level whether that's at West Ham or somewhere else, different country, a different culture maybe,' Wilshere told The Times.

'I still feel like I've got something to give whether that will be in England, in Italy, Spain or anywhere.

'I want to prove people wrong and most of all for myself to see if I can get myself to a high level again.

'I want to show people what I can do. Any footballer that says he's happy being on the bench is lying. I want to play.

'I want to get a run of games, 15-20 games which I still think I can do and have an influence on games and get that confidence back.'

Wilshere has 34 caps for England and his last appearance was the humiliating Euro 2016 defeat to Iceland.

But the midfielder hasn't given up on resurrecting his international career.

'I'd like to still think the door would be open. England should be picked on form and players that are doing well,' Wilshere said.

'It's down to me to do well, get back playing first of all and then get a run of games and start doing well again. I do believe I can do that.'
