Dressing for comfort doesn't mean dressing down where a supermodel is concerned - as demonstrated by Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber on Sunday night.

The duo were seen strutting into Milan airport looking typically glamorous as they prepared to fly home to Los Angeles after Fashion Week.

Kendall rocked a baggy sweater with a slashed blue and grey design, with stone sweatpants and white trainers.

Hailey wore a matching black crop-top and sweatpants combo, flashing her taut waist.

She covered up with a neon pink trench.

Both ladies carried designer luggage, swept their dark manes back from their features and donned face masks and dark shades.

Hailey has been showing off her natural brunette tresses during the annual fashion celebration.

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in the BOSS show on Friday.

The Biebers are gearing up to celebrate their official second wedding anniversary on September 30 following an informal picnic on September 13 to celebrate the day they got their marriage license in New York.
