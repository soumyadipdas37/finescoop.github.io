Apple acquired the music discovery app Shazam in 2018, but did little to push it out to the masses – until now.

The tech giant released the beta of iOS 14.2 to developers for testing, revealing Shazam will be a toggle in the Control Center.

The app has been available for iOS for some time, but users have to summon Siri to use it or open the app manually and a notification will appear that plays the selected song.

When enabled the feature will discover music in the surrounding area and also when the user is wearing headphones.

Apple released the beta of iOS 14.2 to developers for testing, revealing Shazam will be a toggle in the Control Center

Apple purchased the UK-based app two years ago, which allowed users to point their smartphone at an audio source to identify the song playing.

Apple did not give a price for the acquisition, but earlier reports say the iPhone maker paid around $400 million, far short of the most recent $1 billion valuation for privately held Shazam.

Shazam also helps people discover, interact with and share video, audio or printed content across devices and mediums — and allows music fans to follow their favorite artists and share in the thrill of discovery.

However, following the acquisition, Apple had tucked the app away and many users may have forgot it existed.

The toggle will look like the iconic Shazam app that can also identify music users are listening to through headphones. Users simply open the control center, tap the toggle and a notification will appear on the screen

Now, developers testing the beta iOS 14.2 spotted Shazam that will be a main part of the control center, 9to5Mac reports.

The toggle will look like the iconic Shazam app that can also identify music users are listening to through headphones.

Users simply open the control center, tap the toggle and a notification will appear on the screen with the song’s name, album cover and the option to ‘Listen on Apple Music.’

Apple released its iOS 14 Tuesday, unleashing a number of new features like App Clips, widgets and a redesigned home screen.

Although users were happy, developers were found to be the opposite – the firm rolled out the new operating system giving them just one day notice.

The tech giant shared the news Tuesday during its 'Times Flies' event and although users are excited, developers were forced to work double time to meet the submission deadline.

The launch day is also used promote new app features via press releases, blog posts and social media, but the early release means developers are unable to market their technologies. 

With the surprise announcement, many developers flocked to Twitter to share their frustrations with the firm – mainly that it has burned developer goodwill. 

Many developers were blindsided with Apple's announcement to launch its iOS 14 Wednesday, as many believed the release was not until next week. Developers were forced to work double time to meet the submission deadline

Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Series 6 Tuesday at the virtual 'Times Flies,' along with a more affordable Watch SE, a new Air iPad and 8th Generation at the 8th Generation iPad.

However, the firm also snuck in the surprise release of the highly-anticipated iOS 14 during the show. 

Many developers were left in shock after hearing the news, as most of them have apps not ready for review – a process that can take anywhere from hours to days.

The rushed timeline means many apps will bugs and experiencing crashes because developers were unable to tweak and prepare properly.

Developers were frustrated because they were not prepared to submit their apps in one day, as the iOS 14 is launching Wednesday 

Twitter was flooded with developers sharing their frustrations about the Wednesday launch, with many saying Apple has burned its goodwill with developers.

Sawyer Blatz wrote: 'Cannot believe they are just shadow dropping iOS 14. That feels so horrible as a developer.'

One developer noted that the early release was an 'executive decision' and is blaming Apple staff tasked with upholding relationships with them.

Josh Avant shared a tweet Wednesday, a day after the event, saying 'good morning to everyone except Apple Developer Relations.'

Although developers have been able to test their software running under 'beta' versions of the new operating systems for months, the final 'golden master' versions have only just been released

Others felt the only way to handle the news was to joke about it.

Ben Thompson shared: 'Apple announcing the iOS 14 release date 24 hours ahead of time as a summer ending gift developers.'

On the other hand, the rushed timeline means  many apps will bugs and experiencing crashes because developers were unable to tweak and prepare properly.
