A mother-of-three is fighting for her life after being flung from a maxi-taxi in a horror car crash.

Tamika Wever, 24, received serious head injuries when the taxi she was in was struck by another car at Edgeworth near Newcastle, 160km north of Sydney.

She was on the way home from the pub with friends when a Holden Commodore allegedly ran a red light and struck the taxi on Friday night. 

A recording of the Triple 0 call made on the night revealed the carnage paramedics faced when they arrived at the scene.

'Maxi taxi on the side at least three possibly four persons inside. One person on the road breathing extremely shallowly and lost a lot of blood,' the operator said.

'We're gonna load and go. She's critical, heavily unconscious, with a big brain injury. Keep everyone coming for the other resources,' a male operator said after arriving.

Paramedics treated 11 people for various injuries who were all taken to John Hunter Hospital.

The taxi driver, a 46-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman suffered serious injuries. 

Three further taxi passengers - men aged 28, 35 and 47 - suffered minor injuries.

A number of locals rushed to help after being awoken by the loud crash.

'Just kicked in the back window of the maxi taxi, got the other two guys out,' Nick Dupont told Nine News. 

He said the passengers from the Commodore appeared to be traumatised by the accident.

One of them was only 14-years old.  

Paramedics transported 11 people to the John Hunter hospital, with most of the passengers in the Holden Commodore sustaining only minor injuries.

Meanwhile friends and family members for Ms Wever are praying she will wake up.

'We all just want you to wake up please, your babies need you. we all need you,' she wrote.

'I held your hand today and kissed you, I told you how much we all need you and how much I love you.

'You are the strongest person I know and if anyone can do this you can.' 

While another friend revealed her devastation as she shared concerns she may not survive her critical injuries.

'The chances of Tamika's survival is extremely low... this is devastating,' she wrote.

Her cousin Charlii Croese wrote a heartfelt tribute on social media to her 'best friend and rock'

Three passengers in the Holden - two 14-year-old girls and a 17-year-old boy - suffered serious injuries. The Holden driver and a fourth passenger, both aged 17, suffered minor injuries. 

The Holden driver was arrested and subjected to a roadside breath test, allegedly returning a positive result.

He was taken to hospital under police guard where he underwent mandatory testing.

The teen has since been charged with 15 offences, including dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, negligent driving, driving while disqualified and failing to stop for a red light.

He was refused bail to appear in a children's court on Sunday.
