Ever Morales-Lopez, 26, was released from prison for five days on September 3

New York prison officials mistakenly released an MS-13 gang member facing a federal murder charge and it took five days to get him back behind bars last week.

Ever Morales-Lopez, 26, was granted early parole on September 3 for a 2018 conspiracy conviction that came with a three-and-a-half to 10-and-a-half year sentence.

However Washington Correctional Facility in Comstock, Nassau County were apparently unaware of a July federal indictment where he and seven other MS-13 gang members are accused of racketeering in six murders, two attempted murders and a kidnapping conspiracy.

Morales-Lopez is accused of keeping watch for cops while his fellow gang members hacked 20-year-old rival Kerin Pineda to death with a machete on May 21, 2016. 

Pineda was believed to be a member of the 18th Street gang.

On that federal arrest warrant for murder in aid of racketeering, he could face either life in prison or the death penalty.

However instead of being transferred to federal custody to await trial, he was let go, the New York Post reported on Tuesday.

It was only on September 8 that the FBI realized that he had been let go and it took them 12 hours to track him down and get him back into jail.

He left Washington Correctional Facility in Comstock but should have been transferred directly into federal custody to await trial

Morales-Lopez appeared in Central Islip federal court on Thursday and is being held without bail.

He is accused of organizing a place for the Pineda to be killed in New Jersey where the gang would not be caught on surveillance. 

In July he was indicted in a federal case over the 2016 murder of rival gang member 20-year-old Kerin Pineda (pictured)

It's also claimed Morales-Lopez – who goes by 'White Boy' and 'Lenky' - was involved in talks of where and how deep to bury Pineda's body.

Eight gang members are accused in the murder which took place after they lured Pineda to a wooded area near the Merrick-Freeport border and violently hacked at him with machetes.

They then burned his body in a hole that they had made the day before. It took a year for authorities to recover Pineda's body.

On Thursday a judge said Morales-Lopez is a 'danger to the community' and a 'serious risk' when it comes to fleeing.

In August, José Jonathan Guevara-Castro - also known as Suspechoso - was arrested in Acajutla, Sonsonate. Guvara-Casto is believed to have been a part of the Hollywood clique.

'Guevara's arrest more than 2,000 miles away from Long Island where he allegedly participated in the brutal murder of a young man more than four years ago, is a testament to the commitment of this Office and our law enforcement partners to bringing members of the MS-13 gang to justice for their crimes,' Acting United States Attorney DuCharme said last month.

'There is no place to hide, here or abroad, and neither distance nor the passage of time will offer any safe harbor to criminals from our mission to eradicate violent gangs from the Eastern District of New York.'

José Jonathan Guevara-Castro was arrested last month. He is charged in a 24-count indictment that also included seven other members of the MS-13 gang. Charges range from racketeering offenses, murder and narcotics trafficking
