Ben Fordham took over the reins of Alan Jones's top-rating 2GB breakfast program in June.

And fellow radio powerhouse Kyle Sandilands couldn't help but take a swipe at his rival on Tuesday, after the first Sydney radio survey since Jones stepped down revealed that Fordham was No. 1 in the AM ratings.

Speaking on his own KIIS 106.5 show, Sandilands, 49, joked that the reason why Fordham had retained listeners was because 'most people that listen to to 2GB don't even know how to change the radio'.

Couldn't resist! On Tuesday, Kyle Sandilands (pictured) took a cheeky swipe at  2GB host Ben Fordham as he won the AM radio ratings for Sydney

As his co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson laughed, he added: 'A lot of them are on respirators at the moment, so it was very difficult to change the channel.' 

Fordham had faced widespread scrutiny after taking over Jones' breakfast show, but came out on top when the results were released on Tuesday. 

In the ratings, it was also revealed that Kyle and Jackie O maintained their stance as Sydney's number one FM breakfast show, topping the ratings for the fourteenth time. 

'So well done him, well done us and suck d**k to everyone else that took a tumble in the ratings,' Kyle added. 'That's the headline there. Suck d**k.'

The two have famously not seen eye-to-eye in recent years, with Kyle previously branding Ben a 'piece of shit' on the phone during a live radio show in April 2019.

When asked whether he was 'friends' with Ben, Kyle shrieked: 'I'm barely acquaintances with the dog!

'No news today! We'll just take calls, I'll take Ben on and tell him what a piece of sh** he is. As a matter of fact, we'll just ring him up now.'

Kyle then called Ben, blasting: 'Piece of sh**! See ya! You're nothing.' 

A shocked Ben subsequently began to laugh, saying: 'Wow'.

It's not the first time the two radio rivals have been embroiled in a feud. In May last year, Ben remarked how the Kyle & Jackie O Show had remained popular in the youth-focused FM market, despite its host being 'no spring chicken'.

Kyle later hit back at Ben, saying: 'That Ben Fordham's starting to p**s me off.'

Co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson added: 'He's having a few digs here and there!'

Proving himself a formidable replacement for his predecessor, Fordham's breakfast show won the AM breakfast slot with 17.3 per cent in the first survey since Jones' departure - a number almost identical to Jones' last survey results of 17.9 per cent.

2GB enjoys a market-leading 14.2 per cent share overall, which is slightly down from down from 14.8 per cent in April.

Fordham had reportedly been under pressure to produce good ratings after critics claimed he was 'too nice and relaxed' to fill famously fiery Jones' shoes.

However, the Channel Nine star previously told The Australian that he wasn't trying to emulate Jones' style, but rather 'bring his own flavour of breakfast to the radio.'
