New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and Pacific islands such as Fiji may be among the first countries that Australians will be allowed to travel to, Scott Morrison has said.

The Prime Minister revealed on Tuesday that he is considering a 'traffic light system' that would allow people entering Australia from Covid-safe countries to avoid hotel quarantine.

Overseas travel has been banned since March and it remains unclear when it will resume but Mr Morrison said the first step will be to open to 'safe locations'.

'Our borders will open up at some point to safe locations whether it be New Zealand or parts of the Pacific or places like South Korea or Japan or countries that have had a much higher rate of success,' he told reporters.

Mr Morrison said other countries including Denmark and Greece have similar models where returned travellers only have to go into quarantine if they have come from places with high levels of coronavirus. 

He said he was considering letting people quarantine at home instead of in hotels if they fly in from a low-risk country.

'I think home quarantine can play a role in the future and it's something that is being considered by the AHPPC. 

'We will need a more flexible approach that gives us more options for managing this, so I think that is something that is under active consideration,' he said.

Mr Morrison said home quarantine worked well in February and March when many Chinese Australians were returning from China. 

Since March 17 only Australian citizens and permanent residents are allowed to enter Australia. They must complete two weeks of hotel quarantine at their own cost.

Overseas travel is banned until 17 December and that period may be extended. 

A travel bubble is being discussed with New Zealand which will allow holidays without quarantine.

Under plans drawn up by Australia's tourism restart task force, Kiwis would be able to freely enter Australia in November and Aussies would go the other way by January or February. 

The plan, obtained by the The Australian, calls for all states to open their borders by December 1. 

All state and territory leaders want their borders open by Christmas except WA's Mark McGowan and Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk.

Queensland faces an election on October 31 and WA on March 31. Border closures are popular in both states.
