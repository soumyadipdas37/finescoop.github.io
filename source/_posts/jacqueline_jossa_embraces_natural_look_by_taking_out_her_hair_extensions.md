Jacqueline Jossa decided to embrace her natural beauty by taking out her hair extensions on Tuesday.

The actress, 27, shared her more relaxed look as she pulled her short brunette locks back into a ponytail, but claimed she felt 'bald' with her extensions.

Sharing a video, she explained: 'Guys I've taken my tapes out for my hair to have a bit of a rest and I feel completely and utterly bald like I have no hair.

'Actually that's not true, it's not damaged at all to be fair. It just feels a lit thinner. I feel like if you maintain it and look after it it's fine.

'But I do have to make sure I do look after [my hair] which is why I'm having a little break from them.'

Jacqueline then turned to husband Dan Osborne to joke that she felt 'like a stinky old cheese', as she said she was 'just getting riper with age.'
