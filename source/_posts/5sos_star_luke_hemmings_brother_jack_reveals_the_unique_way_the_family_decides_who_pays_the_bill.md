5 Seconds of Summer's frontman Luke Hemmings has an estimated net worth of US $20 million ($27.3 million AUD), according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Jack introduced Luke to the guitar when he was in school, and his obsession with the instrument quickly led his younger brother to international acclaim.
