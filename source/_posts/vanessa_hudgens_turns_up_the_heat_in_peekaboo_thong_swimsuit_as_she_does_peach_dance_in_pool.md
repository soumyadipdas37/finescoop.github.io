She has gotten online love for her dancing skills lately.

And Vanessa Hudgens put them on display yet again as she emphasized her derriere in a peekaboo thong swimsuit for Tik Tok this weekend.

The 31-year-old stood performed what a voice off-screen - possibly her best pal GG Magree - called 'the peach dance.'

Vanessa opted for a throwback chic polka-dot number, adding some stylish touches with a straw hat and a stack of bracelets.

She playfully stuck her tongue out for the camera during the video and raised one hand to the brim of her hat in a classic pinup pose.

Although she has been enjoying the summer heat Vanessa has also been clearly looking ahead towards Halloween.

The High School Musical star recently swung by her social media to upload images of herself in full hair and makeup for a look she called 'spooky bratz doll? Loool.'

She and GG have been glimpsed enjoying strolls out and about together, and their social media also shows them exercising and goofing off together.

The singing star went viral recently after she put her knockout legs on display while dancing on Tik Tok with GG. 

They were recreating Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's choreography from the WAP music video and Vanessa was praised for her moves.

Vanessa, who starred in a televised production of Grease, expertly worked her way through the sultry dance routine in the backyard.

She recently posed up a storm on her Instagram page in full leggy costume as Nicole Kidman's character Satine from Moulin Rouge.

Moulin Rouge was helmed by Baz Luhrmann who is directing an upcoming biopic of Elvis Presley starring Vanessa's ex-boyfriend Austin Butler.

Vanessa was still with Austin when he landed the role and she gushed on Live With Kelly And Ryan last August that she was 'so excited that this is happening for him.'

Elvis' manager 'the Colonel' is played by Tom Hanks, who along with his wife Rita Wilson caught COVID-19 while in Australia for the shoot. They have both recovered.
