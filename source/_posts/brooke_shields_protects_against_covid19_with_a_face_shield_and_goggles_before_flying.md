Brooke Shields isn't taking chances when it comes to flying in a pandemic.

The 55-year-old model and actress took to Instagram on Wednesday to show off her impressive array of facial coverings, the inspiration for which she attributed to supermodel Naomi Campbell.  

'Taking travel tips from @naomi [PLANE EMOJI] On my way across the pond to shoot a @netflix movie!' wrote the mother-of-two.

Accompanying the caption was a photo of the Blue Lagoon stunner in a face shield, N95 face mask and a pair of plastic goggles.

Two videos showed the ex-wife of Andre Agassi disinfecting her seat with sanitizing wipes.

Brooke took her cues from 50-year-old supermodel Campbell, who in July took to her own social media to show herself flying in a complete Hazmat suit.

Brooke is currently partnering with Life Happens - a nonprofit organization promoting life insurance - to bring awareness to parents and people everywhere about the importance of being prepared for the future.

Encouraging people to have these conversations with their family, the actress opened up to her 1M followers on Instagram.

'I’ve made it a priority to strengthen not only my physical health but my financial health as well. September is Life Insurance Awareness Month, and I’m partnering with @lifehappens to share that there’s no better time to get life insurance to stay healthy — mind, body, and finances' she wrote.

In addition to having real time talks with her kids in quarantine, Brooke has spent time hosting themed dinner parties, making TikTok videos and enjoying her family's company on the east coast.

 Shields shares two daughters, Rowan, 17, and Grier, 14, with second husband, screenwriter Chris Henchy.

Highest form of flattery: Campbell even had her own version of Clorox wipes for the trip
