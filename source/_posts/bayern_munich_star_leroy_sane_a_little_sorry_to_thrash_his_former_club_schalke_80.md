Leroy Sane admitted he felt 'a little sorry' to play a part in Bayern Munich's eight-goal thrashing of his former club Schalke.

Bayern's new £44million signing from Manchester City was on target as they opened their Bundesliga title defence in ominous fashion on Friday night.

But the winger said he had some sympathy for the club that nurtured him in the youth ranks before he made 57 first-team appearances between 2014 and 2016.

Leroy Sane scored his first goal for Bayern Munich as his old club Schalke were thrashed 8-0

The £44m summer signing broke clear to score Bayern's seventh goal at the Allianz Arena

'Of course, I was at Schalke for a long time,' Sane said. 'To get such a defeat at the start of the season and it goes so haywire is difficult.

'I'm of course a little sorry.'

Debutant Sane scored the seventh of Bayern's eight goals at the Allianz Arena after a Serge Gnabry hat-trick plus strikes from Leon Goretzka, Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller put the Treble winners in command.

England under-17 international Jamal Musiala became Bayern's youngest ever goalscorer, at 17 years and 205 days, by scoring the eighth.

It was an impressive debut for Bayern's principal summer signing as they started their season

'It felt very good to be on the pitch with the boys,' Sane added.

'It was a very good day. I feel completely at ease and knew that it would work out well with the team. Everyone was hungry.

'Everyone just wanted to attack and give full throttle.'

Bayern have now won 22 consecutive matches in all competitions, having achieved a Treble of Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League last season.

Hansi Flick's team are unbeaten in 31 games during this calendar year and last tasted defeat on December 7 last year.
