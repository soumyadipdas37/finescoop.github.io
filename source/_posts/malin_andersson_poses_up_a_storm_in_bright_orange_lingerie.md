She is a body confidence advocate, known for her empowering posts.

And Malin Andersson was again boosting her followers as she took to Instagram to share a stunning snap while posing in an orange lingerie set.   

The former Love Island star, 27, looked sensational as she turned her head to look at the cameras while showing off her stunning physique while adding a caption in which she detailed her previous battles with underwear.

Malin wrote a caption reading: 'I used to hate bras. I used to hate the fat. The back fat. The bra fat. I wouldn’t wear tight tops because you could see the indent of the bra through it. I also tried to wear non-wired and bandeau in hope you couldn’t see any back fat and that it was smooth. 

'I recently got my back tattooed with two butterfly’s to show myself the growth. The growth of a caterpillar into a butterfly - and that it is possible to GROW in all areas of life and come out the other side.

'I learnt to accept my body when I finally accepted who I am. Who are you? Are you trying to conform? Be someone you’re not? Are you TRULY accepting yourself... or are you trying to fit in to please others. 

'Take a long look at yourself today after you read this post, because we were all out here to be different. The more we try and seek acceptance from others - the less happy we become. This is your reminder - no matter how hard the journey of self love and acceptance is, you gotta ride with it, it’s the only way forward'.

It comes after Malin recently shared lingerie snaps on her Instagram along with a post about body confidence. 

The mental health campaigner penned: 'EMPOWERING EVERY CURVE I HAVE! Our bodies are here to be loved, not hated on.

'Embrace every single inch - do it for yourself not them. Proud to be part of Boux Avenue AW20 campaign spreading the message of self-love and empowerment.'

The reality star's ex Tom Kemp was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on September 3 after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in Instagram posts last year.

But Kemp, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.

Malin and Kemp had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims he had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.

They split again last March, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief.

Malin now wrestles with PTSD, after the abusive relationship left her mental health and self-esteem in tatters.

She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety. The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'
