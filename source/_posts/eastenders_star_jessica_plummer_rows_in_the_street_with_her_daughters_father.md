EastEnders actress Jessica Plummer was reportedly seen breaking down in tears after rowing with the father of her four-year-old daughter.

In a video obtained by the Sun, the TV star, 28, who plays Chantelle Atkins, could be heard screaming that the father of her daughter was 'sneaky' and 'selfish'.

According to the publication the row began when Jessica and the man - known only as Jaz - walked up a street in south London together.

The incident took place last Wednesday morning and Jessica could be heard shouting: 'You're selfish. You're selfish,' while also calling him 'a sneaky person'.

An onlooker told the news outlet: 'I looked out of the window because there was a huge public row going on, and I could hear a woman screaming at someone.

'As soon as I saw her, I realised it was Chantelle from EastEnders. I recognised her straight away.

'After they finished screaming at each other she sat down on a wall and cried and he stormed off in one direction and she walked off the other way.'

A source close to Jessica explained that the argument wasn't a 'big deal' and the disagreement between them has now been resolved. 

MailOnline has contacted representatives for comment. 

Jessica has rarely publicly shared any information about the father of her child and has only posted a video of him when she celebrated her pregnancy in 2016.  

In the caption at the time, she wrote: 'Couldn't be happier to be starting a family with my childhood sweetheart.'

On Friday Jessica's long-suffering character Chantelle Atkins is to be murdered by her abusive husband Gray Atkins in a harrowing cumulative storyline.

The BBC One soap's domestic abuse plot is set to end in tragedy as Chantelle will be killed off at the hands of evil Gray [Toby Alexander-Smith] after she files for divorce. 

Jessica joined EastEnders in March last year and her exit was announced earlier this month, and her last day on screen will be this Friday.
