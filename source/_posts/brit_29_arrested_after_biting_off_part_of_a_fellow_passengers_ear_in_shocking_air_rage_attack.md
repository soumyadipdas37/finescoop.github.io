A British man accused of biting off part of a fellow passenger's ear moments after their flight from Birmingham touched down in Majorca has been arrested. 

The 29-year-old was held after officers called to deal with an altercation on board witnessed the sickening attack.

The incident happened on a plane which had just touched down at Majorca's Palma Airport from Birmingham on Thursday night.

Police said they arrested the holidaymaker after he downed another passenger's drink while the plane was still in the air before his drunken assault.

The Civil Guard said in a statement: 'A 29-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of wounding following an incident on board a plane that had just touched down at Palma Airport.

'The crew on a plane from Birmingham asked us for assistance on Thursday night following a problem linked to a passenger who had been denied alcohol during the flight.

'The man, who was drunk, had ignored their instructions and at one point had even tried to open a fridge with alcohol inside before consuming a drink another passenger had purchased.

'As officers were taking down details of what had occurred by the entrance to the plane, they saw a fight had broken out inside.

'They entered the aircraft and saw the detainee attacking another passenger after biting off part of his right ear.

'He was overpowered and arrested.

'The victim, a compatriot of the man arrested, had to be taken to a hospital in Palma where he was admitted because of the injuries he had suffered after being assisted initially by police at the airport.'

Neither of the two men involved in the incident have yet been named.

A well-placed source described the two men involved as British, although Civil Guard officers could not be reached on Sunday night to confirm their nationalities.

The arrest is very rare in Spain where officers normally deal with alleged cases of air rage by taking down the names and home address of those involved and passing on their details to the Spanish Aviation Safety and Security Agency so they can decide the size of fines.

Airlines tend to wrongly claim air rage passengers have been arrested, even when police have made no arrests because officers have not witnessed the alleged assaults or misbehaviour air crews or pilots allege have occurred.
