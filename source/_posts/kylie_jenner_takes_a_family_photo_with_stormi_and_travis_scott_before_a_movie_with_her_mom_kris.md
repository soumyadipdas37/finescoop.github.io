Her family announced earlier in the day that their iconic reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians would end after its 20th season in 2021.

And Kylie Jenner, 23, marked the news later that night with a fun family get-together as she tried to take a family photo with her squirmy two-year-old daughter Stormi and her ex Travis Scott, 28.

Later, they joined her mother Kris Jenner, 64, for a movie in an IMAX theater that they appeared to have rented to themselves.

Wiggles: Kylie Jenner, 23, posted a funny video to her Insta Stories of her trying to take a family photo with Travis Scott, 28, and her daughter Stormi, two, who wouldn't sit still

Kylie shared a cute video to her Instagram Stories of herself and Travis trying to pose on the steps to her home while she held Stormi in her lap, but the toddler wasn't interested in making it an easy experience.

She squirmed and raised her arms while Kylie tried to get everyone to look at the camera and Travis just just grinned.

'pics with 2 year olds,' she captioned the short clip.

The cosmetics mogul was dressed more for a date night than a family night with her edgy black outfit, which featured a black tank top and a separate item that rode above it with her long sleeves.

The KUWTK star wore black fishnets below her top and had on black pants with chunky black platform boots, along with hair extensions that reached down her back.

Stormi looked cute in a gray T-shirt and navy blue pants with gray trainers, while Travis had on a tan graphic T-shirt with dark jeans and black and yellow sneakers.

Another Insta Stories video showed Stormi walking out to the steps with Kylie and Travis and her mother told her to hold her hand.

 After taking care of their photo, the three met up with Kylie's mother Kris for a movie at an IMAX theater.

'This screen is crazy,' the near-billionaire whispered as she panned across the theater.

It wasn't clear if her family had rented out the theater, as some chains are currently allowing, or if they had just bought tickets to a regular showing.

While waiting for the film to start, Kylie showed off her pin-straight lightened locks before taking a video of her mother, who might have been pretending to take a phone call.

'Are you faking your phone call?' she asked.

'Mmhmm, sure am,' Kris replied.

Although the two couldn't escape the news that their long-running series would be coming to an end, neither mentioned it and instead focused on their family time together.
