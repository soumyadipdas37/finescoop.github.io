Meanwhile, marketing executives have been asking fans to vote for their favourite flavours of 'loaded chips' in a highlight reel on the restaurant's Instagram feed.

The flavour with the most votes will be the latest addition to Nando's iconic menu.

Customers were asked to choose between herb yoghurt and garlic aioli, with the vast majority - 73 percent - opting for the latter.

A choice between capsicum relish and pineapple saw 79 percent in favour of the relish, while more preferred a sprinkle of feta cheese on top of their chips than a handful of olives dotted around the side.
