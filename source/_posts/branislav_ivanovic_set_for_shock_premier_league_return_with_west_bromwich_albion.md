West Bromwich Albion expect to finalise the signing of former Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on Monday after he underwent a medical.

The 36-year-old free agent is awaiting paperwork from previous club Zenit St Petersburg before signing a one year contract.

West Brom also retain interest in Watford's Andre Gray and Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher.

The veteran full-back would be the sixth summer signing for Baggies boss Slaven Bilic

Ivanovic joined Zenit from the Blues in 2017 and has gone on to play 125 games in the past three-and-a-half seasons.

Previously the marauding full-back had spent 10 years at Stamford Bridge in a trophy laden spell that saw him win the Champions League, the Europa League, three Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the League Cup. 

He is set to become the sixth signing for the Premier League new boys under Slaven Bilic following the summer arrivals of Grady Diangana, Matheus Pereira, David Button, Cedric Kipre and Callum Robinson.
