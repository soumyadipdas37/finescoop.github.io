A replica of the 1960s Batmobile needed a jump start after it broke down on a road in Cheshire.

The vehicle, which appeared to have a flat battery, caused a traffic jam with a queue of cars pictured lining up in the background.

The driver was also snapped walking around the side of the Batmobile replica by a grass verge and using a spare battery to try and recharge it.

The vehicle, pictured above, is a replica of the original Batmobile - a sleek black vehicle that starred in the legendary film and TV series in 1966

The Batmobile first appeared on television screens for its debut on 12 January 1966.

It was well known for its rich variety of exciting gadgets, including rockets, oil slicks and a special Batphone.

The famous Bat-Eye switch and Anti-Theft device were also highlights of the car's excitingly futuristic design.

It was previously sold for $4.5million at the Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction in 2013.

The original Batmobile went under the hammer for the first time in 2013, 47 years after its designer built it from an old Lincoln Futura he bought for $1, and sold for an eye-popping $4.6million.

Car customiser George Barris transformed the banger into the sleek black vehicle that starred in the legendary film and TV series. 

The Batmobile started out as a 1955 Lincoln Futura which Barris bought from Ford in 1965 for a nominal $1.

He then spent 15 days and $15,000 transforming the concept car into the one-of-a-kind Batmobile to be driven by actor Adam West.
