Tamara Ecclestone has given birth to a baby girl who she has called Serena, MailOnline can reveal.

The 35-year-old socialite gave birth in a hospital near Bern in Switzerland a week ago.

Serena is her and husband Jay Rutland’s second child. They already have a five-year-old daughter Sophia, who has got her wish of a baby sister.

Surprise! Tamara Eccletone and her husband Jay Rutland have quietly welcomed a second daughter in Switzerland. Pictured with their six-year-old daughter Sophia 

Tamara’s delighted father, billionaire former Formula one boss Bernie Ecclestone confirmed the news from his home in Gstaad in the Swiss Alps today and told MailOnline: 'I’m absolutely thrilled to be a grandfather again.

‘Tamara gave birth to a little girl seven days ago in the same hospital that my son Ace was born in. Mother and baby are doing brilliantly. She’s a beautiful little thing.

‘She has named her Serena and both of them have been already out on the town together around Gstaad.

Baby brother: The happy news comes just months after her father Bernie welcomed his fourth child, a son named Ace, aged 89

‘Serena and Ace are very close in age and so will be able to play together when they’re a little older.

‘I’m delighted that Serena is with us at last. I’m getting quite the collection of grandkids!’

Speaking to Hello magazine last year Tamara, Bernie’s eldest daughter, revealed that she and Jay were trying for another child.

And she said that Sophia - nicknamed Fifi - had wanted a little sister.

She said: ‘She’s been talking about how much she wants a sibling, and for the first time I'm open to the idea.

‘She really wants a sister, but certainly not a brother - she's very girlie and thinks boys are smelly.

‘Having another baby is obviously scary because it would mean a big change, but I'm definitely up for it.’

Tamara and Jay, 39, met in early 2013 and were married just a month later.

The birth of their daughter is some much-needed happy news for the couple after

the £50million robbery at the couple’s palatial home in West London last December.

They are spending time in Switzerland with Bernie, 89, and his wife Fabiana Flosi, 44, who gave birth to Ace in the summer.

Tamara shared her joy at having a baby brother for the first time and joked that he will surrounded by the love of the 'family of girls'. 

The happy news comes just months after her father Bernie welcomed his fourth child, a son named Ace, aged 89. 

In July, the television personality was pictured visiting her baby brother for the first time in Switzerland and her bump was just visible underneath a loose fitting khaki T-shirt.  

Of his birth, she exclusively told MailOnline: 'We couldn't be happier and it's such a special time. It's also so lovely to have a little brother after always being a family of girls!' 

Tamara has managed to keep her pregnancy quiet on social media, carefully uploading photos where her bump is strategically covered or of just her face. 

Back in 2017, Tamara spoke about how she was open to expanding the family after previously thinking she simply 'couldn't love another child as much as Fifi'. 

The heiress said she was considering having another baby because Sophia was about to start to school.

She has previously been mum-shamed for her sometimes unconventional parenting methods.

The Formula 1 heiress, whose father Bernie has an estimated $3.3billion fortune, found herself at the centre of an unexpected social media storm after posting images of her breastfeeding Sophia, who was aged three at the time.

Some users slammed her for oversharing, telling her the images were 'gross' and that there was 'no need' for her to post pictures of her 't*** hanging out' but Tamara is keen to block out the noise and focus on her daughter.

''It's annoying that parenting is one of those things that people are just so opinionated on,' she said in response to the haters.

'Everyone's journey is so different and it's something you shouldn't intrude in. 

Everyone has opinions and everyone is so quick to tell you theirs but I feel you should just take a step back and take direction from your baby and listen to your gut; it's an instinct that you have.'

The doting mum stopped breastfeeding when Sophia was aged four and donated her unused milk to mothers who needed it.

During an episode of Zoe Hardman and Georgia Dayton's new Podcast Made By Mammas last year she said: 'No more breastfeeding for me now – we stopped at the end of last summer,' Tamara explained, adding that her daughter, who she lovingly calls Fifi 'still sometimes says “Mummy boo boo” and I’m like: “No we’re done! The milk has all gone!”'

'She’s getting her head around it. It was a big part of her life I suppose so it’s no surprise she has a trigger and misses it, Tamara pointed out, adding that she doesn't feel like she's missing out on bonding time since stopping feeding.

'It was such a bond breastfeeding Fifi but to be honest she still falls asleep with her head on my boob so we still have that bond. At some point she was going to stop and she did it when she was ready,' she explained.

She was sheathed in a couture Vera Wang gown complete with 30 ft train and crystals on the bodice.

And she took her first dance as Mrs Rutland to a cover of Lionel Richie’s Endless Love, performed live by Mariah Carey — hired for £2.5 million. Miss Carey also sang her new single Beautiful.

Sir Elton John also played an hour-long set on Monday night, dedicating his song Circle Of Life, from the soundtrack to Disney film The Lion King, to the happy couple. It is thought the singer was paid £1 million to attend.
