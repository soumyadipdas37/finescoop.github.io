Australian tennis bad boy Nick Kyrgios has sparked more controversy after reigniting an ugly feud with yet another bitter rival.

The 40th world ranked player fired a cheeky serve at US Open semi-finalist Pablo Carreno Busta just days after he slammed the 30th ranked Spanaird earlier in the grand slam currently being played in New York without crowds.

'If clay didn't exist. Dude wouldn't have even been close to top 50,' Kyrgios tweeted before later deleting it.  

Carreno Busta hit back following his five set quarter final win against Canadian Denis Shapalov on Wednesday.

'He must be pretty bored… when he comes back to tournaments, we will talk about him because he deserves it,' he replied when asked about Kyrgios.

'And in the meantime, well nothing, he will continue to tweet from home.'

Kyrgios remains in Australia and decided to miss the US Open due to fears about the global coronavirus pandemic.

He didn't let Carreno Busta's jibe slide and fired back in typically brutal fashion by uploading a screenshot of their head-to-head record, which Kyrgios leads 2-0.

'Obviously would have love to be playing the US Open but due to conditions didn't feel comfortable,' Kyrios captioned his Instagram story on Friday.

'Yes Carreno Busta, I'm a little bored and I would rather be chopping you again. 2-0 #shhh.' 

Carreno Busta takes on fifth seed Alexander Zverev for a spot in the US Open final Saturday morning Australian time.

Kyrgios' latest swipe at a rival comes four days after he weighed in on the shock disqualification of world number one Novak Djokovic after he smashed the ball at a lineswoman during his fourth round clash against Carreno Busta.

Watching the drama unfold back home, Kyrgios didn't take long to use the disqualification as another excuse to take a cheeky potshot at Djokovic, another bitter rival.

'Swap me for jokers incident. 'Accidentally hitting the ball kid in the throat' how many years would I be banned for' Kyrgios tweeted.

The tweet included a poll of five, 10 or 20 years. The third option has attracted the most votes with more than half of the per cent of more than 208,000 votes.

The tweet quickly garnered thousands of likes, retweets and comments.

Tennis fans were divided over Kyrgios' stinging attack of Djokovic, which not everyone appeciated.

International stars Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer also aren't competing in the US Open.

It wasn't the first time Kyrgios has publicly lashed out at Djokovic in recent months, despite his own share of controversial antics on and off the court over the years.

Kyrgios has previously accused Djokovic of flouting social-distancing measures amid strict lockdown measures during COVID-19 pandemic.

He condemned Djokovic for a 'boneheaded' decision to go ahead with the Adria Tour after the world number one and others tested positive for Covid-19 while hosting an exhibition tournament in Belgrade.

'Prayers up to all the players that have contracted COVID-19. Don't @ me for anything I've done that has been 'irresponsible' or classified as 'stupidity' – this takes the cake,' Kyrgios tweeted at the time.

Kyrgios is yet to announce whether he'll play in the delayed French Open later this month but recently admitted the chances of him playing at Roland Garros are 'slim to none'.

'I don't think at the moment I'm really comfortable going anywhere with the current conditions,' Kyrgios told reporters earlier this week.

'I don't really see any real improvement going on in my eye at the moment but at the same time I don't think it's the best time for sport to be going ahead also.

Fellow Australian Ash Barty announced earlier this week she has made the 'difficult' decision to not defend her French Open crown, her maiden grand slam.
