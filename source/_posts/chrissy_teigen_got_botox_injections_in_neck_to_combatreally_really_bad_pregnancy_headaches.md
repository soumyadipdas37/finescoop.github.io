Chrissy Teigen is expecting her third child with husband John Legend, 41. 

And the 34-year-old model was recently 'cleared' by a doctor to undergo botox treatments with the sole purpose of combating her 'really really bad pregnancy headaches.'

'[I] was thrilled to be cleared to do neck muscle botox along with a crazy combo of beta blocker shots and radio wave frequency something something doctor terms,' tweeted Teigen on Friday.

She added: 'anyhow man it's just so bad but I see the light finally.'

By speaking so candidly about her treatment, Teigen had fans and followers begging her to 'share more info' about the procedure. 

One Twitter user that reached out to Chrissy expressed that, although they were 'not pregnant,' they have been 'looking for another option' for their persistent migraines.

'Jaw Botox for my grinding was a MUST for my regular headaches. You can also do behind the brow for migraines. Life changing,' replied the Sports Illustrated star.

Though Chrissy was able to get her botox treatment approved while pregnant, one follower was not so lucky.

'They wouldn't do my botox when I was pregnant. I get it for migraines. Hope you get some relief,' they wrote.

Chrissy, clearly sympathetic to the Twitter user's struggle, noted that 'if you have the means to go to a neurologist instead of cosmetic it's a lot better and safer because they talk to your OB.'

Teigen also experienced intense pregnancy headaches in 2017, while pregnant with her now two-year-old son Miles.

At the time, she begged her Twitter following to share with her the ways they have  coped with the debilitating side effect.

'I love being pregnant. I like it more than not being pregnant. But the headaches, my god the headaches,' tweeted Chrissy.

On Saturday, Teigen got all dolled up in an aqua toned suit to check out her newly renovated Cravings office in Los Angeles.

The model was visibly excited on her Instagram Story as she made her way to the headquarters.

She also posted a short clip of Luna enjoying a play session with some family friends.

Chrissy and John unveiled their pregnancy to the world via the music video for John's new single Wild, which premiered on August 13.

In an interview with People published Friday, the All Of Me singer admitted that the epic pregnancy reveal was a 'last minute decision.' 

'[Chrissy] was kind of hedging her bets, because we were early in our pregnancy. We hadn't taken all the tests to make sure everything is okay,' he explained.

'And by the time the video would be edited, we could decide whether or not to use that scene.'

Luckily, all of the baby's 'tests came back great and everything was healthy and good, so [they] knew it wouldn't be too early to tell people that [they] were pregnant by that point.'  

'So by the time the edit was done, we were comfortable saying to the world that we were pregnant.'
