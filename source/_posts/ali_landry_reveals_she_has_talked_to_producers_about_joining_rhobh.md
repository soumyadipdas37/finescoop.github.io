With two Housewives already confirmed to be exiting Real Housewives of Beverly Hills - Teddi Mellencamp and Denise Richards - Ali Landry reveals she has talked with producers about joining the show.

The 47-year-old actress appeared on Radio Andy's Jeff Lewis Live on Wednesday, where Lewis asked her about Mellencamp and Richards leaving the show.

Landry revealed she has had discussions with the show's producers, but still she's, 'not sure it's for me.'

When asked if she might get the gig, Landry responded, 'Oh, I don't know Jeff,' though she did reveal discussions with producers have happened.

'I mean, the last time we spoke, I had gone through... I talked to them like three or four different times, the executive producers,' she said. 

'And they said, of course, we would let you know, but, in my heart, I shared that with you, I honestly don't know,' she added.

Landry added, 'I don't know if it's for me,' before adding that she does have two good friends on the show, Kyle Richards and Garcelle Beauvais.

'I do have two of my really good friends on there, and it's killing me that they're in a fight,' Landry said, referring to Richards and Beauvais.

'They genuinely do not like each other,' Landry added. 'I adore them both so much. I feel like it's a big misunderstanding and they need to start from scratch.'

Lewis added that he thought Landry, 'would bring something different to the show,' though Landry wondered, 'but it it something different that they want?'

Lewis speculated that, 'I don't even think they know what they want, I just think they throw girls in and shake it up.'

Landry then added, 'I don't know, we'll see. Look, I'm surrendering to the whole experience. No plans, no expectations.'
