With a family of five to feed it was no surprise to see Coleen Rooney weighed down with shopping bags following a trip to the supermarket on Friday morning. 

The WAG - a parent to four sons with footballer husband Wayne - navigated an overflowing trolley back to her car after calling into a local branch of posh supermarket chain Waitrose in Alderley Edge. 

In accordance with current health and safety guidelines, Coleen, 34, wore a protective face mask as she made her way through the store's sliding doors and into the busy car park.

Opting for a loose fitting white hooded top and black gym leggings, Coleen looked relaxed during her latest outing in the leafy Cheshire town.

She added to her look with a pair of simple black running shoes, while her hair was pulled into a tight ponytail. 

With Wayne back in action for Championship side Derby County, the brunette was alone as she humped half a dozen bulging shopping bags into the boot of her car.

It's understood that Coleen will face fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy in court this coming November – one year after the former accused the latter of leaking stories about her to the press.

Rebekah, wife of Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy, is seeking substantial damages in the libel trial, as she claims to have suffered 'severe and extreme hostility and abuse' in the fallout after the claims were published on Instagram.

The Mirror reports that judge Mr. Justice Nicklin has stated a preliminary trial will decide the 'natural and ordinary' meaning of Coleen’s social media posts.

He has also given Coleen until October 2 to serve a 'statement of case'.

In the September 17 court order he stated: 'It is ordered by consent that there be a trial of the preliminary issue of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of.'

The half-day trial, he has stated, would be heard by a judge specialising in media and communication after November 15.

Coleen has yet to file a defense, though it has been revealed by the judge that she isn't obliged to do so until 28 days after the preliminary hearing.

Court costs are expected to stay under £25,000 on each side, according to the publication, with any party exceeding the limit being required to justify them. 

Coleen's very public feud began when she accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies.
