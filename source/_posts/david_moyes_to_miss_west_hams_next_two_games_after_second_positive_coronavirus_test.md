David Moyes will miss West Ham's next two fixtures after testing positive for coronavirus for a second time, according to the Evening Standard.

The Hammers boss was sent home from the London Stadium in the build up to the east London club's Carabao Cup tie with Hull City, while Issa Diop and Josh Cullen also tested positive. 

The trio were re-tested in the wake of the positive test results but will miss the upcoming fixture against Wolves at the London Stadium, plus the trip to Goodison Park to face Everton in the League Cup on Wednesday, after testing positive for a second time.

West Ham had the stadium and their training ground undergo a deep clean following the positive tests, while the rest of the squad were also tested once more. At the time of writing, the fixture is still set to go ahead.

Hammers owner David Sullivan gave an insight into the testing protocols, before providing an update on the welfare of the manager, on Wednesday morning.  

'What we do in the Premier League, every team we are tested three times a week during pre-season and we are now tested once a week so we were all tested on Monday,' Sullivan told talkSPORT.

'The results came through at literally 6:30/6:45 last night and unfortunately two of the players tested positive, so the manager had to juggle the the team with who was there and then had to go home and self-isolate, as did the two players.

'And then the whole team will be retested today (Wednesday) to see if we have any more casualties. All the players are fine, I mean they have slightly sore throats. 

'The manager actually was on fine form this morning, he has had a slight sore throat for a couple of days but he put it down to the fact that he shouts a lot.

'He is a pretty hands on manager, coach and he is on the training pitch, screaming and shouting. And he said look "I do get a sore throat occasionally, so I thought nothing of it". It’s just a minor sore throat and hopefully it doesn’t get worse.'

West Ham are still in the market for new additions before the transfer window slams shut on October 5. The Hammers have been linked with a loan move for Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who has attracted interest from Southampton and Aston Villa too. 

The Hammers are winless from their first two Premier League games, after losing to both Newcastle and Arsenal from their opening fixtures.
