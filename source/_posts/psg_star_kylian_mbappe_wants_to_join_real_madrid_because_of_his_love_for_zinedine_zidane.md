The Spanish press are adamant that Kylian Mbappe will join Real Madrid next summer after he reportedly informed PSG he wants to leave at the end of the season. 

According to the Times, the French World Cup winner has made clear his plans to leave PSG in the summer of 2021, putting Europe's elite clubs on hot alert - most specifically Real Madrid. 

Mbappe, who has been a long-term target for Real Madrid, is widely considered the best young player in the world and will not be short of suitors next summer.

AS claim Real Madrid are favourites to sign Kylian Mbappe next year for several reasons

But Spanish media are already convinced he is heading for the Bernabeu with AS reporting that Mbappe has his heart set on signing for Madrid.

On Tuesday, AS's back page showed a picture of the France striker mocked up in a Real Madrid kit while the headline read: 'Madrid has the advantage to sign Mbappe'. 

According to their report, the 21-year-old wants to move to the LaLiga champions because of his love for Zinedine Zidane.

AS also claim that Mbappe believes his chances of winning the Champions League and Ballon d'Or are better at Real Madrid.

PSG did not want to sell Mbappe but find themselves in a difficult position with the forward only having two years left on his deal and intent on leaving.

With Mbappe's contract expiring in 2022, next summer will be PSG's last opportunity to cash in on their star asset before running the risk of losing him for free.

It is understood that PSG will demand £140million for Mbappe but Real Madrid could try to exploit the situation and look to seal a discounted deal for £30m less.

Marca ran the headline: 'We are waiting for you Mbappe', alongside Madrid's badge this week

Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City have all been linked with the Frenchman in the past but Madrid are the front runners and the Spanish press seem to be relishing the prospect of him coming to LaLiga.

On Monday, Madrid-based Marca ran with the headline alongside the Real badge: 'We are waiting for you Mbappe' after his plans to leave PSG next summer were revealed. 

Madrid have already drawn up a battle plan for next summer's transfer window, with Mbappe set to be the headline signing while they also target Dayot Upamecano and Eduardo Camavinga.
