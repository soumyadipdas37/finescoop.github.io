Aidan O'Brien-trained Derby winner Serpentine has been added to the line-up for Sunday's Qatar Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe after a 72,000 euro supplementary entry fee was paid.

Serpentine was a surprise winner of the Derby at Epsom in July when making all the running and building up an unassailable lead. 

He has only run once since when fourth to stablemate Mogul in the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp earlier this month when he was ridden with far more restraint.

Serpentine is the only supplementary entry for Sunday's Qatar Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe

Serpentine in a 16-1 shot for the Arc. 

He makes up a five-strong challenge for O'Brien - alongside stablemates Love, Magical, Mogul and Sovereign - with 16 entries still in the race.

Final declaration and jockey bookings will be made on Thursday.
