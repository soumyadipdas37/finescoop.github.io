A group of Deliveroo drivers have been captured brawling in the street after a man alleged threw a rock at them.

The delivery drivers united against two men who were armed with a plank of wood in Battersea, London.

The footage, shared on social media yesterday, showed a delivery driver in a helmet wrestling a man in a sports top to the ground.

A Deliveroo driver is also seen grappling with the man. He holds him to the ground while another driver tries to take the wooden plank.

Both drivers continue to batter the man, with one running and launching a kick at him.

The man shouts: 'f** off you p***' but they haul him across the road as he struggles. 

Suddenly, he breaks free shouting 'f***** c**'. He then shoves one of the delivery drivers to the floor. 

He pounces on top of the driver and rains down a flurry of punches on their head. 

At this point he is thrown off by another driver who slams him to the ground. 

The delivery man previously getting punched then brandishes the plank and hits the man with it.

He manages to wriggle free and gets to his feet but is chased by another driver. As the clip ends, a man's voice can be heard pleading for everyone to 'calm down.' 

The video was shared on Twitter yesterday by London and UK Crime who named the location and said: 'The guy in black t-shirt had thrown a rock at one of the deliveroo drivers'

'Like a pack of animals, never one on one or I think Deliveroo would have come a cropper.'
