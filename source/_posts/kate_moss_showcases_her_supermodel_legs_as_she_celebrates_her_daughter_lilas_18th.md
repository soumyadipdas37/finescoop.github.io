Wow! Kate Moss' daughter Lila turned 18 on Tuesday and the fashionable duo were keen to celebrate the milestone birthday, as they were seen stepping out for lunch in London in typically chic style

Kate looked jaw-dropping for the celebratory lunch as she opted for a skirt with a sky-high hem to show off her model-worthy pins. 

She paired her look with a black jacket and an envy-inducing black Chanel 2.55 handbag, which rounded out the superstar look perfectly.

Like her mum, she wore her hair in long straight lengths however she went for a more cutting edge style in combat boots rather than heels. 

Earlier in the day, Kate's pals took to their Instagram pages to send their well wishes to Lila, posting throwback snaps and messages to commemorate the occasion.

Kate's modelling agency, Artistic Director for Dior Men Kim Jones and her best pal Sadie Frost all took to social media to wish Lila happy birthday.

Kim shared a snap of Lila and her mum Kate, 46, at a candle lit dinner with a male companion, alongside the caption: 'Happy 18th birthday @lilamoss.'

Alongside the touching message Sadie also shared a throwback snap of Lila and her daughter Iris, 19. On her Instagram Stories the star shared a further picture of Lila and Iris together as young girls.

On Kate's modelling agency Instagram page she shared an old snap of herself cuddling her young daughter, alongside the caption: 'Happy 18th birthday Lila. We love you.'

Kate returned to London last month after she had been isolating in her Cotswolds mansion with Lila alongside her long-term partner Count Nikolai and her half-sister Lottie, 22. 

Elegant: Kate made a typically stylish arrival

The troupe were also joined by Kate's hairdresser friend James Brown.

A source told MailOnline: 'Kate and James have been friends their entire careers, they're like family. They're very comfortable living together.

'It's an added perk that James is a hairdresser and has been able to lend his hand when it comes to overgrown roots and out of control hair.

'Lottie, who's dyed her hair pink in lockdown, has also formed a close bond with James – and regularly shops with him when getting food for the house.'
