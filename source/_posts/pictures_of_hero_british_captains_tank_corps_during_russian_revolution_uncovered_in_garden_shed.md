An incredible collection of photographs depicting a decorated British tank captain alongside Cossack warriors during the Russian Revolution has come to light after being uncovered in a garden shed 100 years later.

The black and white snaps were taken by Captain Reginald Shaw MBE, who served with the White Russians during the revolution in 1919 and 1920. 

The pictures were discovered after the captain's old wooden transit chest was found in the garden of a recently deceased relative.

The collection of photos was found alongside Captain Shaw's uniform and pocket book and the entire contents of the chest are set to be auctioned by Bosleys in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.

An incredible collection of photographs depicting British soldiers serving in Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution has emerged after the wooden transit chest of Captain Reginald Shaw MBE was discovered in a garden shed

The Cossacks have long been known for rebelling against Russia's feudal system, allying with Russia's tsars to help create the Russian Empire, with their warrior skills aiding Russia to conquer large parts of the country.

Over time they eventually got a reputation as the tsar's henchmen, before the Russian empire realised they were not able to fully control them. 

The tsars and Cossacks found themselves united during the rise of the Bolsheviks in the early 20th century, and when the Bolsheviks (later communists) came to power they massacred many Cossacks because of their opposition to the revolution. 

Following the fall of the Soviet Union, there has been a revival of Cossack culture, with the Russian Empire turning more and more to the Cossacks as a bolster to security during nationwide events, including the forthcoming Winter Olympics. 

Bernard Pass, auctioneer at Bosleys, said: 'When you consider this uniform, documents and photographs had laid dormant in Captain Shaw's military uniform trunk for over 100 years, many of those years in a shed, it remains a remarkable find.

'The rare connection with the British South Russian Expeditionary Force of 1919 which was to give aid to the Imperial White Russian Army during the Russian Civil war has created an international interest.

'We'd had inquiries coming as far a field as the United States and the Russian Federation.'

The picture collection includes a portrait of Captain Shaw dressed in his military uniform and another snap of a tank being lifted into the air by a crane with an officer stood on top.

Another picture shows a soldier dancing alongside a small bear that has a chain wrapped around its neck.

Captain Shaw was involved in the first tank battle at Amiens on September 15, 1916, while he was serving with the 12th Battalion in the First World War - a year later he was commissioned into the Tank Corps.

Following the end of World War One, Britain sent forces to Russia to help the White Russians in the Bolshevik revolution.

Captain Shaw joined the South Russia expedition as an instructor in March 1919 and resigned his commission a year later after receiving the MBE, Russian Order of St Vladimir and Order of St Anne. 

He later settled in Staffordshire and during World War Two served with the Stone Fire Service before being commissioned into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. 

The sale of the photos, which are expected to fetch £200, will take place on Wednesday. 

In November 1917 the Russian Civil War broke out as several factions fought for the power to determine the country's political future. 

The socialist Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir Lenin, had overthrown the provisional government as different groups battled for control. 

The two largest groups involved in the fighting were the communist Red Army, and the White Army, which favoured capitalism and monarchism. 

The White Army was a union of anti-Bolshevik groups, including peasant militias, the Black Army (Ukrainian anarchists) and other groups fighting for their state's independence from the Russian Empire, led by Tsarist officers. 

The war continued until June 1923 with 13 foreign nations joining the fight against the Red Army. 

Britain, France and the United States supported the White Russian army during their bloody war with Lenin's Bolshevik Red army between 1918 and 1920.

100,000 Allied troops were present in Siberia in March 1919, with British forces making up around 1,800 men - or two infantry battalions.

In total, Britain supplied 30,000 men to the Arctic ports of Murmansk and Archangel while another similar size force was stationed in Caucasus in the south - but these were made up of mostly soldiers unfit for service in Germany. 

Additionally, Winston Churchill, keen on seeing the Russian tsar maintain his hold on Russia, supplied vast quantities of war materials and infrastructure to ensure the Trans-Siberian railway ran properly, amounting to around £100million.

Churchill, the most prominent supporter of the campaign, told the British parliament: 'I think the day will come when it will be recognised without doubt, not only on one side of the house, but throughout the civilised world, that the strangling of Bolshevism at its birth would have been an untold blessing to the human race.' 

The British were engaged in a series of small brutal battles with the enemy before evacuating.

The Allied effort in Russia was half-hearted at best though, with British political leaders initially only intervening to stabilise the country and encourage them to rejoin the First World War.

All Allied forces withdrew from Russia in 1920 after the defeat of Germnay when a decision was made at the Paris Peace Conference for all Allied forces leave Russian territory. This led to the eventual defeat of the White Russians and the overthrowing of the ruling Tsar. 

A year after entering the fight, the French withdrew their troops in March and April 1919, closely followed by British soldiers leaving the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk areas in the autumn of that year, and South Russia in 1920.
