The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are 'operating' in a way they have been 'desperate to for some time' after being 'held back by tradition and hierarchy' in the royal family, their biographer has claimed.

Earlier this week, Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 39, who are currently living in their $14 million mansion in Santa Barbara, signed a new megadeal with Netflix which could be worth as much as $150million.

Speaking on his podcast Heirpod, Omid Scobie said that since stepping back as working members of the royal family in March, the couple had been 'thriving' and had 'taken their careers as philanthropists to a whole other level', adding: 'It shows how much they were held back by tradition, hierarchy and stubbornness within the institution.'    

He added that the Duke and Duchess are 'absolutely happy' now, saying: 'This is the couple operating in a way they were desperate to for some time but couldn't for a number of reasons, many of which tie into what is considered too politically sensitive or not.'

The Duke, 35,  and Duchess of Sussex, 39, are 'operating' in a way they have been 'desperate to for some time' after being 'held back by tradition and hierarchy' in the royal family, their biographer has claimed.

Speaking on the podcast, the Finding Freedom author was asked: 'If The Firm is so experienced of working with powerful world leaders, why couldn't they handle working with Meghan?'

He responded: 'There is no more pragmatic a family than the royal family and I think they are capable of having positive and healthy relationships with anyone.

'As we've seen, this wasn't necessarily about the relationships between the royal family members and Meghan, it was about the institution of monarchy and how they  supported Meghan.

'Had Meghan of come in and done everything by the book, rather than ever come up with her own ideas, or challenge a way of working, or bring in her own ideals than it may have been very different. But that is not what we can realistically expect from a human being.'

The Finding Freedom author said Prince Harry and Meghan are now 'thriving', days after it emerged they have signed a megawatt deal with Netflix 

He added: 'Harry loved her dynamism, it's what made her so exciting to be a team mate with.

'It was that, and the things that we often celebrate about Meghan internally just didn't fit in with the way things were done in the institution.

'Rather than anyone trying to accommodate those differences, it was quickly seen as something very problematic and something many tried to extinguish through leaking stories to the press and making the couple's lives difficult internally.'

He continued: 'It's why now we see them thrive now in a way we haven't seen in a long time. I mean how much have they achieved in a short period of time since leaving the royal family?  

The biographer said the couple are happy with their new lives in America, adding:  'You only need to look at the work they are doing and how vocal they've been about things that are so important to them.' 

Omid's comments come after a royal source claimed Meghan and Prince Harry failed to tell the Queen about their Netflix deal before announcing it to the world. 

Omid said Meghan's 'dynamism' was loved by Prince Harry but seen as 'something very problematic' by others within the institution

Her Majesty, 94, had to be told by her aides about the couple's new venture - which involves a yet-to-be-named production company set on making documentaries, feature films and children's programming. 

A source told The Sun: 'Harry did not inform the Queen about the Netflix deal.'           

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have never produced a TV show, will make documentaries, films, scripted and kids’ programmes in the new partnership.

'Her Majesty is all too aware of the pitfalls of when senior royals embark on lucrative projects - Prince Edwards’ production flop and some of the deals Sarah Ferguson has signed over the years to name a few,' the source told Fabulous.

'Her view is simple, the Royals are not for sale and danger surrounds high profile roles outside of the institution itself.'

They added, however, that the Queen, 'knowing her grandson Harry as she does', will appreciate that the duke and duchess can not be talked out of their plans. 

Harry and Meghan said on Wednesday they had founded a production company to make documentaries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programmes.

But the couple failed to tell the Queen (pictured in July) about their deal, which could be worth as much as $150million, before announcing it to the world, a royal source has claimed 

They vowed to make 'impactful content that unlocks action' and name-checked Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos and spoke of the firm's 'unprecedented reach'.

They are expected to make content which includes work on 'mental health', an animated series about women, a nature documentary and shows on community service.

However, royal officials 'will examine Harry and Meghan's Netflix deal' after they agreed to approval of any new commercial ventures when they quit public life, according to a source.

A palace insider claimed that despite ditching official duties any profit-oriented plans would be 'subject to discussion'.

There are questions over how it will look to the taxpayer when the Sussexes have still not paid off the £2.4million spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.

The source told the Mirror: 'Harry and Meghan did leave as working members of the family with everyone's best wishes and it is sincerely hoped they find the happiness that appeared to be lacking in their lives.

'However, it goes without saying any deals they are making will be scrutinised by the royal household.

'Under the terms of their deal to forgo their royal duties, they agreed any commercial deals would be subject to discussion.'

Harry and Meghan got the green light to broker commercial deals in January - but the moneymaking projects will be scrutinised by the Queen after a year.

The historic agreement ruled the couple will drop their HRH titles, pay back £2.4million of taxpayer cash and no longer receive public funds.

In exchange, they were allowed to quit frontline duties and given licence to expand their brand.
