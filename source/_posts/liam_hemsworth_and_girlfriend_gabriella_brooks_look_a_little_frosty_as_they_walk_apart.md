Temperatures are heating up in Australia as winter melts into spring. 

But Liam Hemsworth, 30, and his girlfriend Gabriella Brooks, 24, looked decidedly frosty as they strolled through New South Wales' coastal town of Byron Bay on Monday. 

The usually loved-up twosome kept a distance between each other, and appeared somewhat downcast as they hiked barefoot to the steps of Byron Bay's famous lighthouse. 

Is everything OK? Liam Hemsworth, 31, and his girlfriend Gabriella Brooks, 24, looked a little frosty as they walked apart from each other during a barefoot hike in Byron May on Monday 

Showcasing her slender frame in a black singlet and matching bike shorts, model Gabriella appeared slightly glum as she walked a few paces behind her actor beau. 

Similarly, Liam looked distracted and stared into the distance as the pair walked down the road in silence.

Liam's muscle-bound physique was covered by a baggy grey T-shirt and black bike shorts.

Both lovebirds kept their famous faces hidden beneath sunglasses, while Liam went a step further by competing his look with a baseball cap. 

Elsewhere, the pair were seen with their shoes on as they walked over a bride.

Liam continued to keep a distance from Gabriella, who was seen trailing behind with both hands on her hips.

Liam and Gabriella have been dating for about nine months.  

They were spotted together for the first time in mid-December last year as they enjoyed a lunch date in Byron Bay with Liam's parents, Craig and Leonie Hemsworth.

Liam was previously married to American pop-star Miley Cyrus, from whom he split in June last year.

The former couple they did not publicly confirm their split until two months later. 

Meanwhile, In March, Us Weekly quoted an insider who alleged that Liam 'feels more at home with Gabriella than he did with [his ex-wife] Miley and feels like he can be his complete self without any drama.'
