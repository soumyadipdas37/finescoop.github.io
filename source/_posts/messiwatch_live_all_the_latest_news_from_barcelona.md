The 33-year-old has informed the Spanish club of his desire to leave this summer, telling them by burofax that he expects to be able to leave for free.

Club President Josep Bartomeu has made it clear the club are prepared to fight tooth and nail for the player. 

It has culminated in head-to-head talks taking place, with Messi's father Jorge flying in from Argentina to Spain for a sit down with the club.
