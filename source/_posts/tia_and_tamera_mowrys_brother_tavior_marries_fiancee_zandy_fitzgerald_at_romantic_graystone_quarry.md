Tia and Tamera Mowry's little brother Tavior is a married man.

The 27-year-old singer/songwriter tied the knot with The New Respects guitarist Zandy Fitzgerald at the picturesque Graystone Quarry near Nashville.

He made the big announcement with a heartwarming snapshot of himself and his bride holding hands at the altar during the ceremony.

'Mr. & Mrs. Mowry. 9.21.20 God is GOOD. It's SO LIT!!!' Tavior gushed in his caption, tagging their officiant Pastor Lyle Phillips.

Zandy, who herself has a twin sister called Lexi, posted her own sweepingly romantic Instagram picture in which she kissed her groom by a wheat field.

'The Mowry's,' wrote Zandy, who has now taken her husband's surname on her Instagram handle. 'God writes the best stories.'

'Mr & Mrs Tavior Mowry,' she captioned another photo, which showed her and Tavior holding hands as they strolled off toward the sunset.

The ceremony was evidently a socially distant affair as the only people visible in the pictures were the happy couple and the pastor.

Zandy and Tavior, who announced their engagement publicly this July, had their first date over two and a half years ago.

'I always said "I want whoever I marry to love God more than He loves me," because I knew if that was the case I would be loved well,' she wrote on Instagram upon the announcement of her engagement.

'That prayer and many others were answered when @taviordontaemowry walked into my life. Two and a half years ago we ate ramen together as strangers and now we‚Äôre PREPARING TO GET MARRIED. What a ride,' she added.

Her Nashville-based band is a family affair, consisting of her, Lexi and their brother Darius as well as a cousin of theirs called Jasmine, according to ANCHR¬†magazine.

Meanwhile Tavior, who along with singing plays multiple instruments, performs under the name Dontae Adisa.

Along with Tavior, Tia and Tamera also have a 34-year-old brother called Tahj who has himself joined showbiz by way of acting and singing.¬†
