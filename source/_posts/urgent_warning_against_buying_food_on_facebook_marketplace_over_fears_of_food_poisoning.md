Australians have been warned not to indulge in any takeaway meals offered on Facebook Marketplace with fears the cheap food could lead to food poisoning.

Curries, noodles, cooked meat, desserts, rice dishes and even raw sausages are just some of the items on offer on the advertising platform with some starting at $8.

But the Food Safety Information Council has warned it's highly likely the home chefs aren't meeting food safety requirements.

Cathy Moir, chair of the health promotion charity said they became aware of the 'illegal' practice in May after noticing a string of 'high-risk' foods were being sold online.

'These unregulated food sales are a considerable food safety risk. There is a real risk of food poisoning, which, in its worst form can have severe health consequences,' Ms Moir said. 

'Not only that, it is illegal. Government and local council enforcement agencies are clamping down on these unregistered food businesses, as and when they become aware of them.

'However, new sellers keep popping up and this is putting a considerable strain on our health services.'

Advertising food does not go against any rules of Facebook Marketplace which is commonly used to buy and sell clothes or furniture.

Thai and Indian dishes were popular on the site along with cakes and other desserts

But Ms Moir said cooking at home couldn't ensure the same level of health and safety as registered businesses would have. 

'It is unlikely that food prepared in a home kitchen or backyard BBQ would meet these standards,' she said.

'Another reason to be extremely wary of these illegal sellers is a risk of allergic reactions. Licensed sellers must also be aware of any labelling requirements, including the allergens in their food, so they can inform consumers.'

There are simple ways to spot if the food is being sold from an unlicensed seller.

Ms Moir said to always check whether or not they had a website or social media page for their business.

She also said if the food was listed at a home address and much cheaper than usual it was likely to be unregulated. 

Another seller is seen using Facebook Marketplace to advertise their homemade fish for $40 

Another rice dish believed to be cooked at home is available on the platform for $12 

Most of the unlicensed vendors offered their meals for 'pick-up only' with prices ranging from around $8 to $35.

Indian and Thai dishes were extremely popular along with cakes and other desserts.

Some were even offering kangaroo meat for dog food while one was offering salted fish.

'If in doubt, don't take the risk of buying unsafe food. Support your local food businesses instead, either in store or by ordering online,' Ms Moir said.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Facebook for comment. 

A platter of sandwiches was also spotted on sale for just $1 in Sydney
