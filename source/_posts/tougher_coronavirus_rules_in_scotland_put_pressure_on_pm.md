Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all imposed restrictions on households meeting up indoors, prompting speculation that Boris Johnson will have to back down and follow suit in England. 

The Prime Minister yesterday set out a wave of measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus. 

But he did not make any changes to rules around households mixing with each other as the existing 'rule of six' provision remained in place. 

However, the other three home nations have all moved on the issue and introduced tighter curbs. 

Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has also told people in Scotland not to book overseas half-term breaks while Wales has restricted the sale of alcohol after 10pm.  

The fact that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have taken a tougher approach in some areas has prompted questions over whether Mr Johnson will now be forced to do the same. 

Below is a breakdown of how the rules are different in each country.

England

Working from home is once again being encouraged, with anyone who can being asked to do so.

People who cannot, such as those working in construction or retail, are being advised they should continue to go to their workplaces.

From Thursday pubs, bars and restaurants must offer table service only and hospitality, leisure, entertainment and tourism businesses will all have to close between 10pm and 5am.

People working in retail, travelling in taxis, and staff and customers in indoor hospitality, except while seated at a table to eat or drink, will have to wear face coverings.

From Monday, a maximum of 15 people will be allowed to attend wedding ceremonies and receptions, but the limit remains at 30 for funerals.

The rule of six, introduced last weekend, that any social gatherings of more than six people both indoors and outdoors are against the law, is being extended to all adult indoor team sports.

Large sporting events, business conferences and exhibitions will not reopen as had been planned from October 1.

The penalties for disobeying the rules will also be greater – failing to wear a mask or breaking the rule of six will see fines doubling to £200 for a first offence.

Businesses which break the rules could be fined up to £10,000 and closed.

Fines of up to £10,000 for people who fail to self-isolate have already been announced.

Downing Street said military support was an option to free up police so they can focus on enforcing the tougher rules.

For people in the shielding category, Mr Johnson said the guidance remains that shielding is not currently needed, unless they are in a local lockdown area.

Scotland

Household mixing indoors will no longer be allowed, with exemptions for those living alone, couples not living together, childcare and tradespeople.

Regulations come into force on Friday but people are being asked to comply from today.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said children under 12 will be exempt from the current limit of six people from two households when meeting outside, and those between 12 and 18 will be able to meet a limit of six others from six households outdoors.

From Friday pubs, bars and restaurants must close at 10pm and further resources will be given to environmental health officials to step up enforcement and inspections, to check that social distancing and other hygiene guidance is being adhered to.

People in Scotland are also being advised against car-sharing, with Ms Sturgeon saying that according to Test and Protect data there is a 'significant risk of transmission' in such settings.

She said no decision has been taken yet on a so-called circuit-break in October, and the Scottish Government is 'keeping it under review'.

She asked people not to book any overseas travel for the half-term break unless it is essential, and to use it as an opportunity to 'further limit social interaction'.

She said people who were shielding earlier in the year are not at this stage being asked to do so again, but that they should follow the steps outlined for the general population.

In an address to the nation, the First Minister acknowledged the measures might feel like 'a step backwards', but added: 'We know what we need to do to protect ourselves and others – and all of us have a part to play.' 

Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has said that only six people are now able to meet indoors and they must be part of a single extended household

Wales

Pubs, cafes, restaurants and casinos in Wales must operate as table service only and close from 10pm on Thursday.

Off-licences including supermarkets will also be stopped from selling alcohol at the same time each day as part of the measures.

Only six people are now able to meet indoors and must be part of a single extended household.

Face coverings must be worn on public transport, in shops and in enclosed public spaces across Wales.

First Minister Mark Drakeford said in a televised address: 'Families have lost loved ones. People have lost jobs and livelihoods. This is a highly infectious virus.

'We cannot let it take a hold of our lives again. We have come too far to let that happen.' 

Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland has the highest infection rate across the UK and Ireland, and fresh Covid-19 restrictions are to be extended from some specific postcodes to the whole country from 6pm on Tuesday.

Households will no longer be allowed to mix indoors, except for single-person bubbles and certain other exemptions.

No more than six people from two households can meet in a garden.

Northern Irish First Minister Arlene Foster said a spike in coronavirus cases was a 'wake up call' and a 'reminder that we are not out of the woods'

Pubs which do not serve food, known as wet pubs, are due to open on Wednesday, despite the latest restrictions.

Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said whether to introduce an early closing time for pubs is something ministers would be considering, describing replicating the 10pm curfew being introduced in England as 'fair enough' to consider.

First Minister Arlene Foster said a two-week period of lockdown to try to halt the spread of the virus, a so-called circuit breaker, could not be ruled out.

Discussing the latest measures on Tuesday evening, she said: 'We need to act, but I do want to reassure you that despite all of the headlines this is not a second lockdown.

'This is a wake-up call, a reminder that we are not out of the woods.'
