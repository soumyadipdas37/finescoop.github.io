She is said to be in the throes of new romantic bliss, after reportedly embarking on a relationship with businessman Josh Riley.

And Megan McKenna had another reason to smile on Wednesday night, when she joined a friend for an early birthday meal at London's Roka restaurant.

The TOWIE star, who is set to turn 28 on Saturday, took advantage of the last night bars and eateries can close later than 10pm, as a second lockdown looms.

Megan stepped out in casually cool style for the night, wearing flattering black skinny jeans and a white crop top, which she shrouded with an oatmeal cardigan.

Standing tall in a pair of box fresh white chunky trainers, the TV personality swept her chestnut brown tresses into a low ponytail.

Accessorising with a selection of jewellery that included large gold hoop earrings, the east London native highlighted her good looks with a natural palette of makeup.

Pal: She was joined by her equally glamorous pal, after they spent the day shopping for clothes

She was all smiles as she made her exit from the upscale eatery, toting a collection of bags, after going on a shopping spree with her friend earlier in the day.

The erstwhile Ex On The Beach star flashed a broad grin at onlookers and struck a pose for waiting photographers before boarding a taxi to head home. 

Last month, it was reported that Megan is 'smitten' with her new businessman beau Josh after he won her heart over during a series of fancy dinner dates. 

Josh is said to have wined and dined the reality star as they enjoyed a date at the swanky Mayfair restaurant Hakkasan, where they originally met earlier this year.

'The pair of them are taking it slow but they have been talking about the future.'
