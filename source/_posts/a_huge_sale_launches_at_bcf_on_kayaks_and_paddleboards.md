An Australian outdoor adventure retailer has slashed the price of its kayaks and paddleboards by 50 per cent in the lead up to summer.

Boating Camping Fishing, which specialises in clothing and equipment for thrill seekers, placed the sale items in its latest catalogue alongside an assortment of tents, mini fridges and gazebos.

There is ample time still to decide what purchases you want to make because the markdowns don't run out until October 11. 

The first kayak, the Glide RFX2400 Sit On Top Kayak, retails for $299.99 usually but has been reduced to $199 during the sale period.
