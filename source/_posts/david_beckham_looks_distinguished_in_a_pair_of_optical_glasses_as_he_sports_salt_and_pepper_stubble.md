He's widely recognised as one of the most handsome men on the planet. 

And, David Beckham looked distinguished in a pair of optical glasses as he sported salt and pepper stubble while enjoying the last days of summer.

The football legend, 45, took to his Instagram on Tuesday evening to share the brooding snap of himself and was sure to tag in his own eyewear brand.

David captioned the photograph: 'Holding onto the last days of summer,' with a sunshine emoji drawing on the golden hour aspect of the shot. 

On his eyewear brand's account, the father-of-four was shown wearing a pair of sunglasses in a throwback from his time in Italy over the summer.  

The brooding shot comes a week after reports from the Sun claimed that the Beckham's and some members of their staff caught coronavirus earlier this year.

David, wife Victoria and their children split their time between the States and the UK between March 5 and 19, travelling from Los Angeles to London to the Cotswolds to Miami and then back to the Cotswolds, with no way of knowing when in their travels they contracted the virus.

The Beckhams began the month in Los Angeles to watch David's football club, Inter Milan FC take on Los Angeles FC in an away game. 

The group then headed out on plenty of network and schmoozing events packed with people. 

Days later, on March 5, the family flew into London and then travelled to their second home in the Cotswolds to celebrate son Brooklyn's 21st birthday. 

The family held a lavish £100,000 bash on March 7 at their home, which was attended by the likes of his fiancee Nicola Peltz, Emma Bunton, Gordon and Tana Ramsay's daughter Holly and rapper Stormzy.

At some point after returning home both David and Victoria develop coronavirus symptoms and quarantine for more than two weeks

Whilst there, David attended a swanky party attended by the likes of rapper Pharrell before overseeing business with his Inter Milan club. 

Just a few days later, the family - excluding eldest son Brooklyn - returned to the UK to stay in their Cotswolds home on March 19, four days before the country went into lockdown.  

However, it is claimed that upon their return the father-of-four began to feel unwell, while Victoria developed a sore throat and a high temperature soon after.

A source told The Sun: 'It was an absolute nightmare scenario,' explaining how David was in LA schmoozing on behalf of his club Inter Miami, when Victoria and their children flew over to support him.

'They attended a couple of swanky networking events as David had promotional duties, and were shaking hands and kissing fans and various club dignitaries,' claimed the insider. 

The source claimed that several of the Beckhams' team, including drivers, bodyguards and PAs - also fell ill, 'a couple of them very badly so'.

According to the insider, Victoria 'really panicked' and forced the entire family to quarantine rigidly for more than the required two week period, defined by the UK government. 

'She was utterly petrified they might be super-spreaders, and did all she could to minimise all future risk,' said the source.  

It has also been claimed that, after making full recoveries, the couple checked in regularly with their team.

They allegedly sent 'care packages' to at least two staff members who were particularly badly affected. 

The Beckhams then spent lockdown quarantined in their country manor, which boasts a swimming pool, hot tub, and of course a football pitch.

The Beckhams defended their decision to spend lockdown in the country manor due to the fact they had already arrived there before the government issued the lockdown order on March 23.   

Following their recovery from COVID-19, Victoria and David are said to have had swab and antibody tests to ensure they no longer had the virus, before jetting off on holiday to Greece and Italy. 

David Beckham's representatives declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
