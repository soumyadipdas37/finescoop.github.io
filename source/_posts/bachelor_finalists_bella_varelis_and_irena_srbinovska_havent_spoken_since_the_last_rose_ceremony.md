Bachelor front-runners Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska called time on their friendship during an explosive cocktail party fight. 

And unable to move on from it, the former friends have apparently cut all ties with one another since filming ended two months ago.

'They're not friends, and never will be,' an insider told Woman's Day on Monday, claiming 'Bella will never forgive her betrayal'.

The Bachelor went into lockdown for about three and a half months, from mid-March until the first week of July, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Once the contestants returned to the mansion, a furious Bella, 25, accused Irena, 31, of lying about the extent of her contact with Locky during self-isolation and called her a 'manipulative little b***h' that she no longer trusted.

The mystery source added that 'jealousy escalated tenfold' on the set between the two ladies, and the friendship was beyond repair.

Irena was previously quoted by the publication as saying her friendship with Bella was 'a disaster waiting to happen'.

An on-set source previously told Daily Mail Australia that Bella was under the impression that Locky was only having 'lengthy' phone and SMS chats with her in lockdown, when he was in fact having similar contact with several girls.

'The real reason they fell out was that Bella couldn't accept the fact that Irena had also formed a close connection with Locky during lockdown.

'She was furious when she found out multiple girls were talking to Locky on a daily basis - but she took it out on Irena because they were so close.'

Reality check: '[Bella] was furious when she found out multiple girls were talking to Locky on a daily basis - but she took it out on Irena because they were so close,' a source said

Bella recently told New Idea magazine that the increasing competition in the house made it difficult to maintain her friendship with Irena.

'I knew she had a good connection with Locky, too. I loved seeing [Irena] come back from her date happy, but seeing her happy made me realise that my connection with Locky may be worse off,' she said.

The marketing consultant also told TV Week she didn't regret confronting Irena, and was glad they were no longer friends.

Bella is widely believed to be the heartbroken runner-up and Irena is tipped to win, according to betting agencies TAB and Sportsbet.
