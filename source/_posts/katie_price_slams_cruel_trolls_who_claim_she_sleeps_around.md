Katie Price has hit out at trolls for accusing her of 'sleeping around' behind boyfriend Carl Woods' back.

The former glamour model, 42, took to Instagram on Tuesday to slam 'infuriating and cruel' people for calling her a 's**g' and who criticised her relationship with the Love Island star, 31.

Not mincing her words, Katie said: 'I’ve heard every bit of abuse, insults and hurtful s**g naming calling under the sun from people who havent met me nor @carljwoods, I’m sick of small minded trolls trying to put us down.

'I’m not a s**g I NEVER slept around being called a s**g is infuriating and cruel. There isn’t many guys that would be able to handle the life changing injuries I have. (sic)'

Sharing a snap of Carl beside her in a wheelchair, Katie, who has been in a relationship with the reality star for two months, added: 'Just be happy for me for once, I deserve it.'

On Saturday, Katie reflected on her 'tough journey' and reassured fans she's 'feeling stronger and determined'. 

Sharing a recent snap of her sat in her wheelchair with her booted feet, she wrote: 'Happy Saturday. I’m back online and just want to thank everyone for all the love and support!  

'It’s a tough journey, but I’m feeling stronger and determined to get through this with all the support of my family, friends, followers and my amazing man @carljwoods.

'Tough': The TV personality returned to social media earlier this week after taking time out to focus on her health following surgery on her two broken feet

It comes after Katie revealed she feared that her horrific foot injury would leave her 'paralysed,' after she plummeted 25ft off a wall at a theme park in Turkey and landed on her feet.  

Katie explained how her feet are 'destroyed' following the incident, and admitted she has returned to The Priory to learn to 'walk again.'

The star, who was on holiday with her boyfriend Carl and her children Princess, 13, and Junior, 15, at the time, said doctors told her they have amputated legs with injuries similar to hers.

Speaking to The Sun, she said: 'The doctors said I'm lucky I'm not dead. I could have hit my head and I could have been paralysed, I am actually lucky I landed on my feet.'

Determined: Katie explained how her feet are 'destroyed' following the incident, and admitted she has returned to The Priory to learn to 'walk again'

She added: 'I thought, "I'm never going to walk again". The doctors said they've cut off legs before after seeing injuries like mine.'

Katie underwent an eight-hour operation to rebuild her feet after she was 'mucking about' following a few drinks and jumped off what she thought was a 'small wall' at the Land of Legends theme park.

The model revealed how she has returned to The Priory because her 'mental health' has been 'badly affected' by her injuries.  

She last visited The Priory in September 2018 and spent 28 days in the facility after her family urged her to seek help following wild partying antics in Mallorca.
