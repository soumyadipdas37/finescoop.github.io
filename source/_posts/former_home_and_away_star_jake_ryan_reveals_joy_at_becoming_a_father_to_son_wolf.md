Former Home And Away star Jake Ryan welcomed his first child, son Wolf William, in October last year.

And ahead of his son's first birthday, the actor has spoken about his journey into parenthood with DJ girlfriend Alice Quiddington.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday, Jake said: 'It's not an easy road; fatherhood or parenthood. But it's the most rewarding and beautiful time. I've loved every second of it.'

Jake and Alice's son Wolf will turn one on October 6, and Jake says his life already has taken on new meaning and purpose.

'My days are just consumed with him, and everything that you sort of do for life is about your child now which is great. It's nice to have that, to have someone else to work towards, apart from yourself.'

While he joked that he goes to bed earlier and gets less sleep than ever before, he finds being a father 'beautiful and rewarding' and is looking forward to more milestones with his little man as the years go on.

Jake also finds it funny that his character on Channel Seven's soap Home and Away helped prepare him for his role as a real-life father.

'I kind of laugh at Robbo's storyline, because as I was sort of leaving the show he was becoming a father and I got a great crash course on how to deal with babies for the last eight weeks that I was there,' he said.

Alice and Jake announced they were expecting in May last year, the same month Jake was spotted filming scenes with a baby on the soap with on-screen wife, played by Bachelor star Sam Frost.

Jake was dramatically killed off Home and Away during the season premiere in January 2020.
