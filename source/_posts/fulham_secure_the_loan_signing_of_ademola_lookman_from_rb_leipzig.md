Fulham have confirmed the capture of winger Ademola Lookman on loan from RB Leipzig.

Lookman will join the Cottagers on an initial loan deal for a fee of around £2million and has sealed a return to the Premier League following his £22.5m move from Everton to Germany last summer.

Winger Lookman, 22, said: 'I'm glad to have it over the line and done now. I'm glad I can be here to help the team.

'After the conversations I had with Scott Parker, I got a great feeling, that's the working relationship I want to have. He's young and hungry and I'm young and hungry as well so it's a good match.'

Fulham are braced for a busy few days ahead of the closure of the transfer market on Monday and after starting the season with three successive league defeats.

They are among the clubs keen on Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek who could leave Stamford Bridge on loan.

Aston Villa's capture of Ross Barkley has now ruled out Villa Park as a potential destination for Loftus-Cheek due to Premier League loan rules.

West Ham are also interested in Loftus-Cheek while Southampton anticipate his wages will be out of their reach.

The Cottagers are also desperate for central defensive reinforcements after shipping 10 goals in those three defeats.

After apologising for Fulham's 3-0 home loss to Aston Villa, Fulham's director of football Tony Khan said: 'We've looked to add centre-backs since [the play-off final at] Wembley.

'I'm sorry we haven't yet as two got Covid and we lost a free we thought was close and had another issue with a fourth centre-back. I promise players in and better efforts from this squad.'

Sassuolo's Brazilian defender Marlon is understood to have failed the medical.

Fulham, along with West Ham, are also understood to have considered Lyon's Joachim Andersen though Torino, managed by his old Sampdoria coach Marco Giampaolo, are favourites to sign the Danish defender.
