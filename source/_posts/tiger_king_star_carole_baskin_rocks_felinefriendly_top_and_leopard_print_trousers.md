And Carole Baskin confirmed that her first performance on the upcoming season of Dancing With the Stars will give a nod to the big cats she loves with Eye of the Tiger.

'I was just approved yesterday to release that we are doing Eye of the Tiger,' she said. 'So I'm very excited about that.'

Remaining true to her work as an animal activist, Baskin said she gave the show's costume department clear instructions to stay away from animal materials. 

'I'm actually sitting in my car outside of costuming right now,' she said. 'And I gave them the instructions that no fur, no feathers, no leather, and anything else.'

Adding that she doesn't care how 'wild' the creators go with her outfit but that she just wants to 'have a blast.'

Baskin recently spoke about her rehearsal progress as she gears up for the season premiere on September 14. 

'It's so much easier than I thought it would be,' the 59-year-old big cat lover told People in an interview published Wednesday. 

She told People: 'When I first saw some clips on YouTube, I thought, 'There's no way that I'm going to be able to do that, not in 100 years of training,' But now, I'm like, 'Dang! This could potentially work.''

The founder of Florida's Big Cat Rescue acknowledged, however, that elements of the preparations do pose a challenge sometimes.

'During rehearsal I'll do the routine 10 times in a row. By the 11th, my mind drifts and I've forgotten all the steps. Then it's time to regroup!' she explained.

Her goal, she added, is 'to be as good as I can so that I can stay on as long as I possibly can.' 

Baskin will be up against an eclectic mix of celebrities all vying to take home the Mirrorball trophy. 

The cast includes Backstreet Boys' AJ McLean, Selling Sunset's Chrishell Stause, former Bachelorette star Kaitlyn Bristowe, former NFL player Vernon Davis, Jesse Metcalfe and Monica Aldama (head coach from Netflix's Cheer).
