A while! As evidenced by her Instagram, they were last together in February, when Pia visited her beau at his LA mansion

In an Instagram photo shared last Wednesday, Pia beamed as she sat next to Patrick in a car, after having spent months apart on opposite sides of the globe. 

'Can't keep us apart! Two Ps in a pod,' Pia wrote online, adding a love heart emoji.

The couple made their public debut at a Halloween party in Los Angeles in October, amid reports they'd started dating back in May.

She finally made their relationship 'Instagram Official' on Christmas Eve, sharing a loved-up photo with Patrick outside of the Louvre in Paris, and captioning it 'P²'.

The couple made their red carpet debut at this year's Academy Awards held in Los Angeles in February.
