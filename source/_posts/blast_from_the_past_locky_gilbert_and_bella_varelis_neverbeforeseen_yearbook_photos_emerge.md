Locky Gilbert has been looking dapper in various suits on this year's The Bachelor.

And on Sunday, never-before-seen yearbook photos obtained by BachieFunny, show what the ladies' man looked like in his teens.

A much-younger Locky, now 31, is seen smiling while standing in the back row of his annual high school photos more than 10 years ago.

Locky flashed his familiar smile at the camera, but had a full turf of brown hair covering his ears and forehead. 

The throwback image appeared to have mixed reactions with fans, with one person commenting: '[Locky] reminds me a bit of Wreck It Ralph.'

Locky chose to write back, commenting with a love-heart emoji: 'I'll take that.' 

While another said: 'What's everyone laughing at, he's cute even back then.'

Upon seeing the throwback image, evicted contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe jokingly commented: 'Let's not start this trend.' 

The popular Instagram account also shared high school photographs of contestant Bella Varelis and Bachelor In Paradise star Jamie Dornan in a separate post.

'This really isn't well,' Jamie wrote underneath the throwback photo of himself.

One fan voiced that the former fire proofer looked like a 'total heart-breaker' while Bella looked like 'one of those mean girls'.

Bella, 25, was immediately recognizable thanks to her brunette tresses and bangs.

The throwback photos come just days after Bella's Twitter account from 2010 resurfaced and her old tweets include several odes to teen heartthrob Justin Bieber. 

Bella, who was 15 years old when she posted the tweets, appears to have had a bad case of Bieber fever in the early 2000s.

'You are absolutely amazing just listened to ur 2day fm radio interview! I CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH AND SMILEE :) <3 come back !!' she tweeted at the pop star.

The teenage fangirl didn't stop there, and even begged Justin to follow her back.

She wrote: 'YOU ARE FREAKING AMAZING but it sucks cUse your not following me :( HOW DO I MAKE YOU FOLLOW MEE !! bahaha :( '
