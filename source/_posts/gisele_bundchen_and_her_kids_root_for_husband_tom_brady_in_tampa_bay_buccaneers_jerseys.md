He won a record six Super Bowls during his 20 seasons with the New England Patriots before moving on to join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

And Tom Brady's wife Gisele Bündchen showed she and the kids were totally on board as they cheered on his new team ahead of the Bucs' game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

The 40-year-old supermodel shared a boomerang of her and her dancing while wearing Buccaneers jerseys to mark the big day.

Team spirit: Gisele Bündchen, 40, and her children Benjamin, 10, and Vivian, seven, cheered on their dad Tom Brady by wearing Buccaneers jerseys and dancing in a boomerang posted on Sunday

Gisele had on her number 12 jersey as she pumped her fist in the air and bobbed her head side to side.

The 5ft11in beauty paired the jersey with a slim pair of jeans and had her wavy brunette locks parted down the middle.

Her son Benjamin, 10, looked like he was doing the twist just in front of her, while her seven-year-old daughter Vivian kept her jazz hands aloft while beaming ear-to-ear.

'Let's go Bucs, let's go papai!!!!' the former Victoria's Secret Angel captioned the boomerang, using the Portuguese version of daddy or papa.

Success! Gisele seems to have been on the money, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers clobbered the Carolina Panthers 31–17

Gisele seems to have given her husband and his team a lucky boost, as the Buccaneers clobbered the Panthers 31–17.

The win was the quarterback's first as a Buccaneer, after the New Orleans Saints defeated them 34–23 last week.

Tom made history at the game, becoming the oldest player in the NFL and the oldest person to ever score a touchdown.

Intimate details: Earlier this month, Tom sounded shocked after Dax Shepard asked on his Armchair Expert podcast if he ever had sex before games. 'Oh man, that's probably off the table,' he replied 

Earlier this month, Tom appeared on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast and shot down the suggestion that he and his wife celebrate in more a more intimate manner before his games.

The actor asked the 43-year-old quarterback his 'single Howard Stern-esque question' of the podcast: 'Do you make love to your wife on a game day?'

After letting out a laugh, Tom said, 'Oh man, that's probably off the table.'

'I wouldn't say it's probably never happened, but I don't think that would be the moment,' the six-time Super Bowl champ clarified.

Tom and Gisele have been together since 2006, and they married in 2009 in Santa Monica, California.

In addition to his two children with Gisele, the football star shares his 13-year-old son Jack with his former partner Bridget Moynahan.

Around the same time Tom was explaining his game day routines, his wife was getting personal about her struggles with anxiety.

Gisele shared a sweet photo of herself curled up with the family dog Lua while extolling the benefits of a 'reminder that the bad feelings will eventually go away...'

'Anxiety can feel all-consuming, and sometimes we need a supportive push to help break us out of our vicious cycle of worry,' she continued.

She revealed that she sought treatment in response to panic attacks, and specialists, along with her friends and family, helped her to move forward.
