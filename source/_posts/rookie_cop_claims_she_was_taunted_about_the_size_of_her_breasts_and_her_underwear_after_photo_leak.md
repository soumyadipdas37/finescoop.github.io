A female police officer has claimed she was sexually harassed and bullied by colleagues during her short career in law enforcement.

Christie Lee Turner is suing the Queensland Government for nearly $900,000 in damages over the alleged abuse while working at Murgon in the state's south-east. 

Court documents filed in the Supreme Court allege a male police officer stole revealing photographs of Ms Turner from a personal USB she left on a work computer. 

Ms Turner claims the officer allegedly commented on the size of her breasts and colour of her underwear and later offered for her to send him more pictures.

The officer accused of taking the sensitive photos allegedly said 'you must have wanted me to have the photographs, or you wouldn't have left them on that hard drive,' according to court documents obtained by The Courier Mail.  

Ms Turner alleges two officers ridiculed and embarrassed her in front of other colleagues after the incident, which led to her suffering nightmares, panic attacks and thoughts of self harm.

She has since been medically retired from the police force with post traumatic stress disorder and has reported the alleged incidents to the Ethical Standards Command.

'I'm hoping that my case going public could save others from finding themselves in the situation that has been inflicted on me,' Ms Turner said.

The accused officer has denied he took the photos from Ms Turner's USB.

A Queensland Police spokesperson said the allegations against the officers were being taken seriously.

'It is essential that all employees of the QPS enjoy a safe working environment free from bullying, unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment and predatory behaviour,' they said.
