Eliza Reign Seraphin is gearing upon to take Future back to court after a judge ruled he pay her $3,200 a month in child support for their one-year-old daughter Reign, well short of the $53,000 she had asked for.

'We are very hopeful that once we get all the documentation from him, his banking info, his credit card info, that the final child support number would be substantially higher,' Seraphin's lawyer Brandon Rotbart told The Shade Room on Tuesday.

Seraphin and her legal team said they disagreed with the 36-year-old rapper's estimate he only makes $30,000 a month.

'We had some other evidence that was contradictory,' Rotbart told the outlet. 'It’s only just begun.'

Future and Seraphin were involved between 2016 and 2018; he previously took her to court alleging she was defaming him with lies, but the case was mostly tossed.

Forbes magazine last year toted the 2019 income for The rap artist, whose real name is Nayvadius Wilburn, at $19.5 million.

Earlier this year, TMZ reported that the rapper was telling people that Seraphin purposely got pregnant to set herself up monetarily, and that she calls the child the 'check baby.'

Sticking point: Seraphin and her legal team said they disagreed with the rapper's estimate he only makes $30,000 a month 

Earlier this summer, she passed on his proposal of $1,000 monthly and health insurance for the child under the condition she no longer publicly speak about him or the ongoing legal matter, Bossip reported.

'I have discussed your proposed order with my client, and we are NOT in agreement,' Seraphin's lawyer Brandon Rotbart told Future's attorney Ramona Liberty via email, the outlet reported. 'Should you have a reasonable child support amount to offer, I am happy to discuss it with my client.'

Rotbart also told People that the Mask Off artist's proposal was little more than a gambit so he could say he paid something to support his child.

The Atlanta native has six children, three boys and three girls, as he's father to sons Future Zahir (with Ciara), Prince and Jakobi, and daughters Londyn and Hendrix from past relationships.  

He was recently dating socialite Lori Harvey, but they have since parted ways.
