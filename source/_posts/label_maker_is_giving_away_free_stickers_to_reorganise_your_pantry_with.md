An Australian label making company is giving customers free stickers for their pantry jars, toiletries and cleaning products for a limited time only.

In order to redeem them you need to visit the website and find the 'pantry labels' and 'household labels' tab - these are the ones included in the sale.

Each pack comes with 72 stickers - with mini, standard and round sizing - and you can redeem one free purchase per transaction.

The colour, font and style of label is entirely up to you and customisable at the checkout, where you will need to input the term 'home' in the discount code section to redeem.  

It's important to note that Hippo Blue charge a $5 flat rate for shipping anywhere across Australia.

Earlier this morning the website crashed due to such high demand but it is now up and running again as usual.

'I just ordered some and have had no issues. So excited to decorate the kitchen with them,' one woman wrote on social media.

'I've actually purchased these before and found they were really great,' said another.

A third added: 'I have one of their stickers on my daughter's drink bottle and it has gone through the dishwasher plenty of times... it has never faded or peeled off'. 

It's not known when the offer originally started - or how long it will last for - but as it is advertising spring cleaning many people feel as though it won't be around much longer.
