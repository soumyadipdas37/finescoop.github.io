She won the 2020 BRIT award for the best British Female Solo Artist.   

And the rising star, Mabel, made sure all eyes were on her as she donned a striking outfit choice and headed to dinner with friends in Mayfair on Friday evening.  

The Finders Keepers songstress, 24, rocked a Kangol black and neon green cut-out dress which she paired with military-style boots as she strutted her stuff through the city.

Mabel switched up her hairstyle as she sported long blonde braids, and she highlighted her delicate features with a subtle peachy makeup look. 

The Spanish-born singer displayed her petite frame in the black mini dress that featured neon green piping on the sides and had the Kangol motif emblazoned on the front.

She also draped her stylish black Kangol handbag over her shoulder and rocked black lace-up boots with pockets attached to the sides.

Mabel's pals looked effortlessly stylish as one was seeing wearing grey wide leg jeans and a white cropped top. 

Her other pal rocked a silver quilted jacket and short co-ord set while her male friend sported a grey polo neck jumper with slim-fitting cream jogging bottoms and suede shoes. 

The beauty's recent outing comes after she was spotted enjoying a possible date night with Roman Kemp.

The newly single radio presenter, 27, split from his girlfriend of three years, Anne-Sophie Flury this summer. 

Taking to Twitter last month, the I'm A Celeb star admitted that he had joined Bumble to get back into the dating game.

He said the app 'sets you up' and has been 'helping [him] out massively'. 

 

And Roman was spotted enjoying the company of his friends last Friday night, and Mabel, as they ate at London's Novikov.
