It's not the first time the blond Adonis has visited a race track this week.

'You were there whenever I needed you, you taught me how to cook gourmet food like roast potatoes, chicken and salad, and tacos - the essentials in our household,' he wrote.  

'You gave me a slight insight into fashion by dressing me in up in dresses and putting makeup on me when I was young. You'd sit behind me while I ate dinner and would pick at anything pimple looking on my back - even if it was just a mole,' he added.

'You were my second mother, you were my biggest sister, you were my friend, and you were a fighter until the very end,' he continued. 

'I will love you forever': Jett Kenny shared a heartbreaking tribute to his sister Jaimi Kenny - six days after her tragic death at aged 33

Jett went on to say: 'Jaimi, I will love you forever and you will always have a place in my heart. I will miss you dearly, but cherish the moments we had together greatly. I love you so much, and I will see you again at some point.'

He also thanked 'everyone for their overwhelming love and support'. 

The Kenny-Curry family confirmed Jaimi's death on September 14 in a statement.

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement by Jaimi's father, Grant.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued. 

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child.
