Former Australian cricket captain Steve Smith and his wife Dani Willis have lodged paperwork for extensive renovation to their recently purchased $6.6 million home in Vaucluse.

The athlete, 31, is seeking to completely remodel each level of his four bedrooms and six-bathrooms abode from the basement to the master suite.

A larger gym, a mammoth extension to the kitchen and a no-expense-spared living room for entertainment purposes is all part of Steve's vision for his impressive new three-storey property.

Plans for the renovation by Precision Planning has been lodged by Steve and Dani's finance adviser Trent Tavoletti from Titan Finance.

As well as making the gym in his basement bigger, the star is keen on expanding his kitchen to an open-plan dining room complete with stacked doors and plenty of windows.

His hopes to extend the kitchen against a specific wall will see the current study turn it into a luxurious butler's pantry.

The happy couple are also hoping to install a statement fireplace and integrated TV set up in the living room.

The incredible home is near to the water and has impressive views of Sydney Harbour. 

As well as a gym, it has a number of luxury features including an in-ground pool and a spa experience with a steam room. 

It's also perfect for entertaining, with a wine cellar that can hold 400 bottles of the good stuff.

There is also a purpose-built barbecue and wine fridge to add to the alfresco dining experience.     

It is believed the couple plan to either renovate or rebuild the home to suit their taste.  

The couple lived at their beach side abode in Coogee, which they snapped up in 2011, until recently. 

They also own properties in Balmain, Marrickville, Sans Souci and Birchgrove.
