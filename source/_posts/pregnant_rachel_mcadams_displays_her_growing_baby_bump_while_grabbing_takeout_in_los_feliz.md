Rachel McAdams is pregnant with her second child. 

And on Thursday the 41-year-old Mean Girls star looked ready to pop as she wore a fitted pink striped shirt while picking up takeout food at espresso bar All Time in Los Feliz, California.

The star already has a son with her boyfriend of four years, Dear John screenwriter Jamie Linden, 40.

For her food run, she wore a knee-length black cotton skirt and a pink striped tank which she layered under a lightweight grey button down. 

Rounding out the outfit she threw on a pair of comfortable pink sandals, a blue face mask and tortoise shell glasses as she walked to her Tesla with her food in tow.

Despite the LA heat, Rachel left her blonde hair down, keeping to herself while texting on her phone.

Dual living: Though Rachel has been out in Los Angeles, the Canadian born actress splits time between Hollywood and her country home outside of Toronto 

Though an actress in the public eye, McAdams is very protective when it comes to her family life and does not have any social media. 

The Notebook actress quietly gave birth to her now two-year-old son - whose name has never been publicly released - in April 2018.  

During her first pregnancy she avoided the public eye, even skipping the premiere of her film Game Night. 

Speaking to the Sunday Times in 2018, she said 'I want to keep his life private, even if mine isn't.'

Six months after giving birth to her son, McAdams posed for Girls Girls Girls Magazine where she was seen dolled up while using a breast pump in a stylized shoot for Versace.   

Rachel first sparked pregnancy rumors for the second time after she and boyfriend Jamie were seen out in August. 

The couple who have been in LA also split time between their country home outside Toronto where she lives out her dream of being a farmer, and gives her son a chance to interact with animals. 

In a virtual interview for Heroes of Health back in April, she shared that spending time with her son in quarantine was a blessing though at times challenging.

Eurovision: Rachel's film with Will Ferrell was released during quarantine on Netflix. In the film she plays a small town singer chasing big dreams of winning it big at the Eurovision Song Contest

 'There are days, sure, but I would be so bored without him around to make it so fun' she said adding that he is 'so entertaining.'

The actress who had finished shooting Netflix's Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga opposite Will Ferrell before lockdown, has now been afforded quality time to spend with her little family while Hollywood slowly and safely gears up for a full re-opening.

Upcoming projects for Rachel include Sherlock Holmes 3 which has now been pushed from a December 2020 release date to a December 2021 date. The film will continue to star Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law.
