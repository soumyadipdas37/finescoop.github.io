Former V8 superstar Renee Gracie who sensationally quit motorsports to become an OnlyFans porn star has revealed how she has splashed her cash.  

Gracie has earned more than $1million dollars selling nudes online- a lavish jump from her previous $18,000-a-year pay cheque.  

And after racking up over $500,000 in one month, the adult entertainer decided to spoil herself to her own Mercedes supercar. 

'I earned over $500,000 in June. I haven’t had a month that big but I am fairly consistent with my earning from month to month. I will keep on working and posting videos. I don’t see that type of money disappearing or stopping anytime soon and that is why I made the decision to buy the car,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

As a driver, Gracie has revealed she only earned $18,000 a year, over 55 times less than the more than $1million she has earned in the adult industry. She is pictured preparing for practice at Bathurst in 2015

The car enthusiast traded in her second-hand mustang to purchase her new $350,000 ride, which she paid for in cash. 

The top end model boasts 596 horsepower, reaching speeds up to 332km/h.

'It is more a race car than a sports car. I’d prefer power to luxury and this car is ridiculously fast. I would be able to see how it really goes until I get it out onto a track. I will do a few things to it and will get it out on the track for a track day when I am happy with it,' she said. 

'It was a big deal for me when I was able to earn enough money just to buy the second-hand Mustang. I was broke when I finished racing. It actually cost me money to go racing and half the time I was out of pocket just trying to buy food. I was staying in crappy hotels. Now I have earned more than $1 million in less than a year.' 

Her expensive new toy can go faster than speeds reached by drivers on fastest strip of the Mount Panaroma track in Bathurst.

The announcement comes days after before-and-after pictures emerged showing just how much the former private schoolgirl has transformed in the nine months since leaving the track.

Throwback photos of Renee from her Supercars days show her wearing minimal makeup, and with her now-famous curves hidden beneath baggy racing attire. 

In contrast, recent social media photos show the brunette bombshell wearing heavy makeup while leaving very little of her body to the imagination. 

Having previously been forced to hide her sprawling tattoo collection beneath a racing uniform, Renee is now enjoying the freedom to show off her ink online. 

Among her many tattoos is a dramatic chandelier-inspired design around her breasts, as well as an image of Buddha on her thigh.

The Queenslander was once Australia's first female professional V8 Supercars driver, having famously partnered with Swiss racer Simona de Silvestro at Bathurst in 2015.

But after years of financial struggles, Renee abandoned her racing career and began posting nude pictures on adult website OnlyFans in late 2019.

OnlyFans is a subscription-based platform which allows 'creators' to earn money by sharing pornographic content for a monthly fee.

Speaking about her decision to quit Supercars, Renee told Daily Mail Australia in July she 'just couldn't afford it anymore'.

'I had to come up with $600,000 a year to race,' she said. 'I had to get my own sponsors and any crashes or scratches I got on the car I had to pay for myself.

'We had insurance but the excess was so high that the team bosses used to tell me, "Don't crash – but if you do, make sure you write it off." Just a minor crash could cost $10,000. It's a savage sport.'





She now earns up to $25,000 per week selling explicit content on OnlyFans.

Renee claims she has no regrets about turning to porn, saying she didn't make a cent in her seven years of racing.

'I'm in a position now where I don't have to be reliant on anyone else. I don't have to beg for sponsorship,' she said.

Despite working in an industry in which she makes racy content for strangers, Renee says her parents support her new career

'I have the money to pay for it myself. When I think back to where I was two years ago to where I am now I almost can't believe it,' she added.

Despite working in an industry in which she makes racy content for strangers, she says her parents support her new career.

'Believe it or not, my dad knows it and supports it,' she recently told TN Sport.

'I think you could say my dad is actually proud because of the financial position I am in and what I have been able to do with the site. You look at what I have achieved not what I am doing, it has been a success.'

Renee also recently admitted that at one point she thought about quitting the adult industry, before her father encouraged her to continue.

'I had a little bit of a rough time on OnlyFans. It does get hard to try and be creative all the time. I turned to my dad and said, "I'm just over it, I don't think I'm going to do it anymore,"' she told the Hit Network's Hughesy & Ed.

 Renee has recently begun mentoring women starting out on OnlyFans 

'And he actually said, "Don't stop, you're making so much money, don't stop." He actually encouraged me to keep doing it because it's been life-changing, and if anyone was in the position to make this kind of money everyone would try and do it.' 

Meanwhile, Renee has recently begun mentoring women starting out on OnlyFans.

'I have coached a lot of girls now,' Renee said in a YouTube video in June, while promoting her own 'mentoring' website for breaking into the porn industry. 

'I share all my tips and tricks, the games I play. I have themed days, I have really good ways for how to structure your page and be consistent with your pricing,' she said.
