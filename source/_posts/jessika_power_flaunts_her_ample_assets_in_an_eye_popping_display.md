Former Married At First Sight star Jessika Power doesn't hold back when it comes to flaunting her figure on social media.

Posting to Instagram, the reality star flaunted her ample assets and pert derrière in a barely there pink snakeskin bikini.

Last week, Jessika candidly talked about the fat transfer 'boob job' she underwent in early 2019. 

She praised the surgery on Instagram and called her Double Bay-based surgeon, Dr Anoop Rastogi, 'amazing'. 

The TV beauty explained to fans that the enhancement surgery achieved 'natural' looking breasts, taking her from a small C cup to a large D cup.

'This isn't an implant, these aren't silicone, this is all of my breast,' she said.

'It's just the extra bit of fat I have on the side of my thighs that I wasn't happy with, injected into my boobs,' she added.

The blonde bombshell revealed that she spent two weeks in bed recovering and had no complications, but noted that different people will have different recovery times.

Jessika said: 'I would suggest this to anyone, I would suggest it over implants any day.'
