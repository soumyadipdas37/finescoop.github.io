Jackie 'O' Henderson split up with her ex-husband, Lee Henderson, almost two years ago.

And on Thursday, the radio queen revealed the type of man she wants to date.

In a discussion with co-host Kyle Sandilands on the Kyle and Jackie O show, the 45-year-old revealed she wants a 'man's man'.

Ready to find a man! Radio queen Jackie 'O' Henderson revealed the type of man she wants to date, two years on from her split with ex-husband Lee Henderson. On Thursday, she told co-host Kyle Sandilands that she was looking for a 'a man's man' 

Kyle, 49, asked: 'But you still like the rough man right? Not too rough?'

'Yep, just like a man's man,' she explained.

The radio shock jock picked up a newspaper and asked Jackie to flick through the pages to see if there was a man in there that caught her eye. 

Could he be the one? After flicking through a newspaper, she stopped when she saw a man dressed in an orange hi-vis shirt and posing with a chain saw. 'Who's this guy? He's alright. He's a timber producer,' Jackie said before showing Kyle (pictured above)

'Who's this guy? He's alright. He's a timber producer,' Jackie said before showing the photo to Kyle, who was shocked at her choice of man.

'I like the look of him,' she explained, as Kyle, still baffled, said: 'This guy? There's no way!'
