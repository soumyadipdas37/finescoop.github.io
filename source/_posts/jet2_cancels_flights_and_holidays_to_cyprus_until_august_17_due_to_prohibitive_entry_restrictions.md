Jet2 has cancelled all flights and holidays to Cyprus until at least August 17.

The tour operator had been due to restart flights and holidays to Larnaca and Paphos on Saturday, August 1.

But it says it had 'no choice' other than to cancel trips to the island due to its 'prohibitive entry restrictions'.

British nationals can enter Cyprus again from Saturday.

However, they are required to prove they have obtained a negative coronavirus test 72 hours before entering the country.

The results must show the time and date of the negative test and travellers must also complete a Cyprus Flight Pass online form.  

A Jet2 spokesperson said: 'Because of prohibitive entry restrictions into Cyprus, we have no choice but to suspend flights and holidays to Larnaca and Paphos up to and including August 16.

'We continue to urge the Cypriot authorities to review the entry criteria in line with other destinations, so that our customers can enjoy their well-deserved holidays.

'Where customers are affected by any programme changes, we have been repeatedly recognised for how we have been looking after customers, offering the option to rebook with no admin fee, a Refund Credit Note or a full cash refund, and we will be contacting customers to discuss these options.

'For customers who are due to travel to Cyprus from August 17 onwards, we are continuing to liaise with the authorities in Cyprus and we will provide further updates in due course. We would like to thank our customers for their understanding and patience.'

Earlier this week, Jet2 cancelled all flights to 10 destinations in mainland Spain until August 16 and to the Balearic and Canary Islands until August 9.

This followed the UK government switching its travel advice for Spain on Monday to be against all non-essential travel, and a new regulation - introduced without warning on Saturday - stipulating that all passengers from Spain and its islands have to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return to Britain or risk a £1,000 fine. 

Tui has also suspended its holidays to mainland Spain, until August 10, and to the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands until August 4.

Airlines easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways are continuing their flying programmes from the UK to Spain.
