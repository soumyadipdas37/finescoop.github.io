A new avocado that farmers claim tastes better than the Hass is set to hit major supermarkets across the country. 

The Delroy family have been developing the new 'Delcado' for the last 30 years at their orchards in Pemberton, southwest WA.

Delcados arrived at Sydney Markets last week and will be sold at Woolworths, Coles, ALDI and Harris Farm Markets from October to February.

Orchard owner Russell Delroy said Delcados have 'a little more depth of flavour, a rich, almost nutty smoothness and a delicious aftertaste at the back of the palette'.

Avocados harvested in Australia are generally removed from the tree as soon as possible since they only ripen after being picked.  

But Mr Delroy's daughter Suzie, 25, said Delcados have a different flavour because they mature on the tree for much longer at 12 to 16 months. 

'It's just quality control. They taste fresh because we keep them on the tree for longer. So, slower growing times and good temperature management results in better tasting avocados,' she said. 

'Plus, we try really hard to get them from farm to shelf faster than anyone else.'   

Ms Delroy said the local Karri loam soil is high in nutrients and the surrounding freshwater is 'pristine', which allows the avocados to flourish.

Delcados are checked every day and the oil content of the fruit is also tested before its picked to ensure it has the right qualities. 

Once picked, the avocados are X-rayed for bruises, blemishes, sunburn and damage beneath the skin and scanned and photographed 26 times for quality control. 

Premium avocados are transported from farm to supermarket shelves within 12 days.

Avocados that don't meet the premium Delcado specifications are graded and supplied to food service, weekend markets, food manufacturers or used on the farm.

Hass avocados are in season from May through to January while Shepard avocados are in season from February through to May.

Delcado avocados will be available at from October to February, when historically the Hass variety would have to be imported. 

The first batch of Delcados arrived at Sydney Markets last week and will be sold at Woolworths, Coles, ALDI and Harris Farm Markets in the coming months. 

Australians consumed a yearly average of 3.81kg of avocado per person in 2018/19. 

During this same time, 85,546 tonnes of avocado were produced, which is expected to increase to at least 115,000 tonnes by 2025.
