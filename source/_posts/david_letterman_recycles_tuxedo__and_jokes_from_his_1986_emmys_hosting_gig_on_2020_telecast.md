David Letterman made a surprise appearance at the Emmy awards on Sunday.

The legendary stand up comic and late night host taped a video to present the Emmy for Variety Talk Series.

Letterman, 73, did his bit while standing by the side of a rural road wearing a tuxedo after being 'thrown out' of his Uber ride.

Legend: David Letterman made a surprise appearance at the Emmy Awards Sunday. The stand up comic and late night host taped a video to present the Emmy for Variety Talk Series

'This tuxedo, the last time I wore it was in 1986, when I hosted the Emmys,' the former Late Show host said.

'Here's what I found in the pocket... these are jokes from the 1986 Emmys,' he explained as he took some cars out of his jacket.

He then delivered his old jokes: 'What a great looking crowd... so many stars, so much cocaine.'

'Is this the Emmys or the Mets locker room?' he deadpanned.

Deadpan delivery: 'This tuxedo, the last time I wore it was in 1986, when I hosted the Emmys,' he said. 'Here's what I found in the pocket... these are jokes from the 1986 Emmys'

Home ont he farm: He then delivered his old jokes: 'What a great looking crowd... so many stars, so much cocaine. Is this the Emmys or the Mets locker room?'

Letterman hosted The Late Show on CBS from 1993 to 2015.

Since stepping down, he has been enjoying a quieter life - and growing a large bushy beard - on his country estate in New York with wife Regina and their son Harry, 16.

This year's Emmys hosted by Jimmy Kimmel were held at LA's Staples Center with COVID19 precautions including testing and social distancing in place. 

Dutch courage: ABC's late night host Jimmy Kimmel served as emcee of the Emmys that were radically different from any other major awards show in Hollywood history

Pandemic mode: The awards show took place without an audience at LA's Staples Center and with the night's winners providing their acceptance speeches via video link

There was no live audience and the handful of celebrities who showed up on stage had all been tested for the coronavirus beforehand.

The nominees watched from their homes where cameras had been installed so they could give their acceptance speeches remotely during the live telecast on ABC.

In addition to honoring the best in television, the awards show also included a tribute to Tyler Perry. 

The African-American entertainment mogul has championed greater diversity in Hollywood, and this year paid funeral costs for black victims of police violence including George Floyd.
