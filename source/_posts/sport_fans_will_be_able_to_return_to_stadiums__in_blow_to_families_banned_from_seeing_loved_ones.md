Proposals to reopen stadiums to thousands of sports fans have been slammed by furious families complaining about new coronavirus restrictions in force across England which ban relatives from meeting their loved ones. 

The Government has today confirmed that up to 2,500 spectators will be allowed back into stadiums from October 1 in a bid to stop the income stream of clubs across the UK from drying up after months of grueling lockdown.  

But the move threatens to undermine Boris Johnson's new restrictions which were drawn up and imposed by officials after rising numbers of 'cases' caused a panic.

People have angrily complained about the apparent inconsistencies of the Government's new Rule of Six, which outlaws social gatherings of seven or more people in England and effectively makes Christmas Dinner an arrestable offence.

The decision follows threats by Government officials to 'consider' imposing a 10pm curfew to prevent young people being blamed for a so-called spike in coronavirus infections from going to the pub and flouting social distancing guidelines.

It also comes as ministers are admonished by the Press for admitting that they would dob in their neighbours if they suspected they were breaking the Rule of Six as the Government presides over the transformation of Britain into a nation of narks. 

On Twitter account ranted: 'As much as I want this (access to sports stadiums) to happen, it'll make literally zero sense when we're banning groups of 6 and more'.

Another posted: 'How on earth can this possibly be approved when government have made bold statements about no more than groups of 6?'

'Whilst that is brilliant, and without wanting to get 'political', what the actual f...' another wrote. '24 hours ago we were told you can't have more than 6 people in a group and now up to 1000 can possibly go to the football'.

One Twitter account sarcastically commented: 'Keep people in bubbles but forget about the crowds going in and out the stadium'.  

The English Football League today announced plans to continue to stage pilots with up to 1,000 fans at football matches this weekend.  

In a letter to clubs this morning, the EFL's head of policy John Nagle said: 'We cannot guarantee at this stage that all clubs that would like to stage a pilot will be given permission to do so, as only a limited number will be approved.

'We are still in discussions with regard to pilot matches on other dates.'

Mr Nagle apologised for the 'late notice and short timescales', but said 'we are very much in the government's hands on this one'.

An EFL spokesman said it remains 'in discussions with the Government about the pilot programme which may include a limited number of further pilot matches during September with capacity limited to 1,000'.

'The League is clear in its view that social distancing can be applied safely in football stadia and that having crowds at matches is an absolutely essential part of helping to protect club finances, which remain under extreme pressure,' they added.

'Therefore, the successful delivery of further pilots will be an important step towards getting larger numbers of fans into grounds safely.'

The Chairman of the National League, Brian Barwick, has written Mr Dowden today to 'carefully consider' how its pending decision on the return of fans to football grounds will affect its clubs, their employees, and local communities.

The National League has also asked the Government for permission to commence the new season on October 3 - which is when 24 clubs would be due to play their first League match -  with social distancing measures in place.  

Brian Barwick said: 'The National League restart depends upon crowds being allowed back in stadiums as live attendance is our clubs' largest source of income.

'The Government urgently needs to set out a credible pathway for the safe return of supporters, and to ensure our football clubs can continue to function, and to perform their significant role in the sporting life of the country.

'We are proud to be a national competition with strong local connections.' 

Nigel Huddleston of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport wrote to fellow Conservative MP and former Sports Minister Tracey Crouch to underline the plan to continue to open sporting events for a small number of spectators from October 1.

'I know how important this is for sports clubs for whom paying spectators are vital,' Huddleston wrote to Crouch. 'Subject to public health conditions, we hope to open elite sport fixtures including the National League for socially distanced spectators under covid-secure conditions from October 1.'
