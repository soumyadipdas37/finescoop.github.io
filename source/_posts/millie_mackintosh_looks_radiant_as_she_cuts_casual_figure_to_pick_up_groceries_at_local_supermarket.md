Millie displayed her postpartum figure in a pair of grey leopard print leggings and a black vest top.

The reality star finished her look with Nike trainers, a black hoodie tied around her waist and a face mask, which she held in her hand amid the Covid-19 crisis.

Adding some glamorous touches, Millie wore a pair of oversized sunglasses and accessorised with a suede handbag.

The mother-of-one styled her brunette locks into a sleek sweptback ponytail, she appeared to go make-up free and showed off her radiant complexion.

Millie appeared to be making a phone call after her supermarket visit as she walked with her mobile in hand.  

It comes after the MIC star posed for a smiley snap with baby Sienna, four months, and shared a video of her little girl 'trying to say her first word'.   

The former Made In Chelsea star took to Instagram, where she shared the adorable footage of her baby lying in her crib, attempting to say 'hello.'

Sienna tried to mimic her mother who repeatedly said 'hello', and encouraged her daughter to do the same.

In the cute clip, the sweet girl managed to utter 'eh oh,' as she copied the noise made by Millie.   

Last week, Millie took to Instagram to upload a sweet snap of herself cradling her baby girl as she wore her harness and said Sienna is back to her 'usually smiley self' after she was diagnosed with hip dysplasia.
