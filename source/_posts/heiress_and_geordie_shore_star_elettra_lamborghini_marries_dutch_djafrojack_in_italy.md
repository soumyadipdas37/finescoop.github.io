Heiress Elettra Lamborghini has married Afrojack in a lavish ceremony at the luxurious Villa Balbiano in Lake Como, Italy.

Dressed in a beautiful sheer white fishtail gown with lace detailing, the granddaughter of motoring company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini, 26, exchanged vows with the Dutch DJ, 33, in a beautiful ceremony overlooking the water with their friends and family in attendance.

Elettra - who made a fleeting appearance on UK reality series Geordie Shore in 2017 - and Afrojack - real name Nick van de Wall - married exactly two years after they first starting dating, and 10 months after announcing their engagement in December 2019.

Elettra looked nothing short of incredible in the stunning sheer white gown with a floral lace embroidery from a luxury boutique in Naples, that highlighted her incredible physique in a mermaid style.

Meanwhile Afrojack opted for a classic black tuxedo as he tenderly kissed his new wife's hand before they were declared married.

Among the guests in attendance for the ceremony were the DJ David Guetta, who shared a glimpse of the wedding on Instagram.

As well as descending from the founder of one of the world's biggest car companies, Elettra rose to prominence as a social media star in her native Italy, and was even dubbed that country's 'Paris Hilton'.

She joined the cast of Geordie Shore's Spanish counterpart Super Shore in 2016, and eventually joined the original series' Newcastle cast the following year.

No stranger to clashing with her co-stars, Elettra previously admitted she has no interest in joining the family business, telling Quién: 'I don't work, but with respect to everyone who works, I have things I need to do, things that have to do with my figure and something in fashion.'
