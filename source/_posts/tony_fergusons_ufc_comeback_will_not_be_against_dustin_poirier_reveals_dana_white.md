Tony Ferguson is on the comeback trail following his defeat by Justin Gaethje but he will not face Dustin Poirier, according to UFC supremo Dana White.

The lightweight was on the receiving end of a brutal beating from Gaethje at UFC 249 in Florida back in May.

It looked as though the pair were set to meet in the octagon at UFC 254 on October 24 but White has now ruled that out.

'No, we're not even trying to salvage it,' White told MMA Junkie. 

'We're getting another fight. It'll happen (with a different opponent for Ferguson).'

Ferguson is set to make his UFC return next month as he looks to get his title bid back on track after Gaethje's fifth-round stoppage win set up a showdown against Khabib Nurmagomedov for the lightweight title.

Poirier was submitted by Khabib in Abu Dhabi in 2019 but overcame Dan Hooker this summer.  

Khabib's match-up with Gaethje tops the bill of the event in just over a month's time but it is unknown who Ferguson will meet.
