This is the shocking moment a fountain of red wine erupted from a 50,000-litre tank at a winery in Spain.

Footage shared on social media yesterday shows a group of large metal wine tanks at the Bodegas Vitivinos winery in Villamalea, Spain.

At the start of the video, a large jet of red wine is seen pouring out of one of the tanks and spilling out onto the floor.

Red wine erupts from a 50,000-litre tank at the Bodegas Vitivinos winery in Villamalea, Spain

A sea of red soon covers the entire area as it spreads out underneath vehicles parked nearby.

Winery workers can only watch helplessly as the thousands of litres of wine slowly drain away into a nearby field.

Local media has reported that a break in one of the vats may have caused the wine to break free of the tank.

MailOnline has approached Bodegas Vitivino for comment. 

The video was originally shared on social media yesterday and has been liked almost 38,000 times and has been retweeted more than 9,000 times.

Bodegas Vitivinos was founded in 1969, with a production of 6,000,000 kilos of grapes.

Their facilities are currently run under the supervision of Dr. José P. Gracia.

The vast quantity of red wine seen pouring from the tank drew comparisons to the film The Shining from people on Twitter.

One scene in the film has a wave of blood come crashing out of a lift and flood a hotel corridor.
