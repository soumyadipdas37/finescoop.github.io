Instagram queen Tammy Hembrow has revealed her mother has gifted her a personal security device for her safety. 

The 26-year-old took to Instagram on Tuesday, showing off a handheld alarm. 

'My mum got me this thing and told me to take it everywhere with me,' Tammy said, tapping her finger on the alarm.

The influencer then asked her two young children, Wolf, five, and Saskia, four, to test out the device. 

'Arrrgh,' Tammy said. 'Turn it off, turn it off. It's so loud.' 

She finished: 'So thank you mum. No one is ever going to try and kidnap me.' 

Tammy's mother Nathalie is often compared to Kris Jenner. The celebrity matriarch reluctantly features in some of her daughter's Instagram posts.

Tammy has had a tumultuous personal life lately, with her ex Reece Hawkins announcing her is expecting a child with fiancee, London Goheen. 

The busty blonde appeared to take a dig at him on Father's Day, when she posted to her Instagram account. 

She uploaded a photo of herself posing with daughter Saskia along with a very telling caption.
