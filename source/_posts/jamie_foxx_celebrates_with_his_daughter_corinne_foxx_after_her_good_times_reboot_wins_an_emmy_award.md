Jamie Foxx and his daughter Corinne could barely contain their excitement after her Good Times reboot won a Creative Arts Emmy.

The 52-year-old actor shared a video to Instagram of the two celebrating the award with wine on Tuesday night.

The movie star previously played the role of George Jefferson in another episode of Live In Front Of A Studio Audience, an update of classic Norman Lear sitcoms, which was also honored with an Emmy.

Proud papa: Jamie Foxx, 52, was over the moon as he celebrated with his daughter Corinne Foxx, 26, after her special Live In Front Of A Studio Audience won a Creative Arts Emmy Award

'Celebrations, celebrations!' Jamie shouted as he lifted his stemless wine glass aloft.

'Somebody just won an Emmy!' he said as he clinked glasses with Corinne, 26. 'My beautiful daughter Corinne Marie Fox, she is all grown up and she is an Emmy winner for Live In Front Of A Studio Audience for Good Times!'

'Daddy–daughter time, this is what love is all about,' he said before taking another sip.

The Oscar winner then shouted, 'You won an Emmy! You won an Emmy!' before ending the video.

'I would like to introduce to you my daughter Emmy award winning @corinnefoxx !!!! Congratulations on your Emmy award performance!!! in good times on live in front of a studio audience!!! You are my heart and I am so proud of you… Keep elevating… I love you!' the actor wrote in his caption.

Excited: 'Somebody just won an Emmy!' he said as he clinked glasses with Corinne, 26. 'My beautiful daughter Corinne Marie Fox, she is all grown up and she is an Emmy winner for Live In Front Of A Studio Audience for Good Times!'

Good Times: 'Daddy–daughter time, this is what love is all about,' he said before taking another sip

Corinne did plenty of celebrating over on her own Instagram page with a selfie from the set of Live In Front Of A Studio Audience with her costar Tiffany Haddish.

'WE WON AN EMMY! Outstanding Variety Special (LIVE) congrats to all our amazing producers for putting this show together! Such a dream! @thenormanlear @jimmykimmel @kerrywashington @simpsonstreet @abcnetwork @thebrent_miller,' she wrote.

Though she was celebrating the show's win, Corinne technically didn't win herself, as only the show's producers are honored when a show wins.

The Emmy Rules and Procedures booklet states that three commemorative Emmys can be ordered by the studio, but they can't be for individuals. 

The Beat Shazam DJ followed her post up with another video of her dancing and letting loose with her wine.

'What Emmy win celebrations look like in 2020,' she wrote, adding the hashtag, '#StillCelebratingTho.'

Live In Front Of A Studio Audience was originally broadcast in May 2019 and recreated two classic sitcom episodes from shows created by Norman Lear.

Woody Harrelson and Marisa Tomei starred as Archie and Edith Bunker in the episode Henry's Farewell, which originally introduced the character of George Jefferson (played here by Jamie).

The second half of the broadcast featured A Friend In Need, a restaged version of the first episode of The Jeffersons, with a cast featuring Wanda Sykes, Kerry Washington and Will Ferrell.

The idea to reboot the episodes came from Jimmy Kimmel, who also hosted the broadcast.

Back for more: A second broadcast in December 2019 redid episodes of All In The Family and Good Times. Corinne starred in the latter as Thelma with Tiffany Haddish, Andre Braugher and Viola Davis

The show's success, which was bolstered by many of its stars being unannounced, led to a follow-up that paired another All In The Family episode with another Lear sitcom, Good Times.

Corrine was featured as Thelma, one of the children of Florida and James Evans.

The new version featured Andre Braugher and Viola Davis as her parents, with Tiffany Haddish and Jay Pharoah rounding out the cast.

In addition to winning Outstanding Variety Special, the second special also picked up the award for Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video Control for a Special.

Jamie's celebrations come amid news that his ex-girlfriend Katie Holmes has moved on with chef Emilio Vitolo Jr., whom she's been showing off plenty of PDA with recently in New York City.

Foxx and Holmes dated secretively starting in 2013, shortly after her divorce from Tom Cruise.

The couple finally took their relationship public in the summer of 2019, only to break up shortly afterward amid rumors of his infidelities.
