Sunrise host Samantha Armytage has taken a brutal swipe at the Kardashians after they revealed their hit series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, would be coming to an end after fourteen years. 

The 44-year-old's delight at the shocking reality television news was evident on Wednesday's episode of The Morning Show as she asked: 'Is this an existential crisis for the Kardashians?'

After years of making her disdain for the famous Kardashian-Jenner clan well known, Samantha sarcastically continued: 'If they are not on a reality show, do they cease to exist as people.'

'Will they cease to exist?' Sunrise's Samantha Armytage has taken a swipe at the Kardashians after they revealed their hit series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, would be coming to an end after fourteen years

Speaking about the family's hugely popular E! reality show coming to an end, Natalie Barr admitted there was 'no update on exactly how much cash that family has made.'

Sam quipped in: 'Well, we could quickly do some maths.'

The outspoken broadcaster then cruelly queried if Kim Kardashian and her famous family members would 'cease to exist' without their television show - which first debuted in 2007.

Her comments left her co-host David Koch in a fit of hysterics, who joked that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would step into their reality television shoes for a show entitled, 'Keeping Up With The Windsors'.

Sam added: 'Isn't Ryan Seacrest one of the producers. I think he's probably just cut the contract. Probably just waning ratings.'

This isn't the first time Sam has taken a swipe at the Los Angeles based family. Back in 2016 she poked fun at Kim's famous derriere.  

The blonde TV personality shared a snap of her curves from side-on with the hashtag 'Samantha Kardashian'.

Just days later, Samantha found herself at war with Kim's younger sister, Khloe.     

Khloe was forced to defend herself after her appearance on the morning show Sunrise cut off amidst questions about her niece North West.

'We thought it was a technical glitch but turns out @KhloEkardashian's people pulled the plug after @Sam_armytage asked about baby North,' Sunrise tweeted.

Shock announcement: On Tuesday evening, Kim announced that her family's iconic reality show was over after 14 years on air

Khloe fired back accusing the morning show of trying to create a story out of nothing.

'Why would I cut an interview short because of North? Get over yourself Sunrise... The call dropped... stop reaching for a story,' she tweeted.

'You are so f***ing desperate!'

However, Sunrise executive producer Michael Pell told the MailOnline at the time that Khloe's people did pull the plug on the interview and said her local rep had apologised.

Host David fired back and called Khloe an 'idiot' later in the program.

'[My daughter] Brie's going to be very angry with me criticising Khloe, but she's an idiot,' he said. 'I'm sorry… I'm sorry to do that.'

On Tuesday evening, Kim announced that her family's iconic reality show was over after 14 years on air.

In an Instagram message, the make-up mogul wrote: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.

 Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.

'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'

'This show made us who we are, and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'

While no reasons have been given behind the reality show coming to an end, its more recent series have suffered poor ratings.

In April this year, it was reported that viewership had sunk to 871,000 viewers, making that episode the 4th lowest rated episode ever.

At its peak, KUWTK earned E! its most-watched day ever, when 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries - the episode, Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event - Part 2, aired in 2011.
