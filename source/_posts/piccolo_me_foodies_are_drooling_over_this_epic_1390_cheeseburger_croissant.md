Diners are drooling over an epic cheeseburger croissant mash-up - complete with beef patties, double cheese and pickles.

Australian cafe chain Piccolo Me has mixed traditional flavours with a modern twist to create the ultimate $13.90 'Cheesy Frenchy' with a side of fries.

The classic burger buns have been replaced with a buttery, flaky croissant filled with double beef and cheese, pickles, red onion slices, mustard and tomato sauce.

'When's the last time you got out of your comfort zone and tried a Cheeseburger Croissant with an extra beef patty?,' the cafe owners wrote on Instagram. 

'Treat yourself today with the tastiest Cheeseburger Croissant out there.'

Many were amazed with the mouthwatering dish while one man joked: 'A crime against the national treasure of France.'

The cafe is known for creating spectacular food menu items such as a $16 'Piccolo Me' big breaky, $9.90 King's 'hangover' roll with bacon, egg, cheese, and hash brown, and a $10.90 'Fried Maltella' which is fried Nutella ice cream, crushed Malteasers and salted caramel sauce.

Another incredible creation is the $25 pancake burger with double beef patties, cheese, bacon and cheese, served between three fluffy pancakes, topped with maple syrup.

But for the more reserved diners, there are all your usual favourites like a traditional cheeseburger, bacon and egg roll, smashed avocado on toast, and a crispy fried chicken burger. 

Piccolo Me was founded in October 2012 - and has since rolled out 24 outlets across Sydney and Melbourne.
