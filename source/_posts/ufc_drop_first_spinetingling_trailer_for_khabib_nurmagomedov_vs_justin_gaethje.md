Justin Gaethje is the dangerous challenger many think could undo Khabib Nurmagomedov

The challenger smells blood and has an incredible record of finishing fights 

Footage of Khabib beating Conor McGregor was used in the promo video by the UFC







Ever since Gaethje dominated Tony Ferguson, winning by fifth-round TKO earlier this summer, there has been huge anticipation about his fight with Khabib. 

Many believe he has the attributes that could cause the fearsome wrestler problems and the legendary cardio to back it up over a whole 25 minutes. 

The UFC's promotional video begins by showing Gaethje overcoming Ferguson and afterwards throwing the interim belt on the mat, declaring that he is only interested in the real thing.  

Khabib promised to smash Gaethje in the promotional video released on Thursday morning
