Robin Wright recently reunited with her costars from the 1987 classic romance film The Princess Bride.

But the Golden Globe winner has come quite a long way since starring as the titular Buttercup.

She put her toned physique on display Monday in skintight navy blue leggings with sheer cutouts, as she stepped out to walk her dog with husband Clement Giraudet in Los Angeles.

The 54-year-old complemented the look with a white t-shirt, a long-sleeve black shirt wrapped around her waist and a pair of neon blue trainers.

She finished the ensemble with a navy blue Ford baseball cap, a pair of brown sunglasses and a blue disposable surgical mask.

Her French hubby, 36, sported a black Metallica t-shirt with matching gym shorts and face mask, as they walked Joséphine (aka Jojo) on a leash.
