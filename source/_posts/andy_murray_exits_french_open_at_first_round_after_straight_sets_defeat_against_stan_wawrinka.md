Andy Murray was comprehensively beaten by Stan Wawrinka in three quick sets in the Scot’s first match at Roland Garros since 2017.

Murray was included in the main draw thanks to a wildcard, but his lack of playing time in an injury-ravaged few years was evident as he was dispatched by 35-year-old Wawrinka, who won 6-1, 6-3, 6-2. 

The Swiss player, who defeated Novak Djokovic to claim the 2015 title at Roland Garros, produced 42 winners to his opponent's 10 in a match lasting one hour and 37 minutes.

Dan Evans was vanquished after a titanic five-set tussle with ex-US Open finalist Kei Nishikori

Murray's last match on clay had been a bruising five-set encounter against Wawrinka three years ago at this very tournament, but the tone was set on the opening day this year when Murray was broken in successive service games as the first set raced by. 

Wawrinka's ruthlessness saw him wrap up the second set in 33 minutes and he was no doubt keen to end proceedings quickly on a chilly day in Paris, sealing victory following a 25-minute third set.

Murray's loss followed Dan Evans' defeat in a topsy-turvy encounter on Court 14. 

The 30-year-old from Solihull took the first set 6-1 against former world No 4 Kei Nishikori.

The Japanese man replied with the same scoreline in the second set before holding off an Evans fightback to edge ahead in the contest after taking the third-set tiebreak.  

More Evans brilliance saw him win the fourth set 6-1 and force a decider, but Nishikori had the greater steel and wrapped up the win.
