Leicester City target Wesley Fofana has turned down the offer of a new contract from St Etienne as he pushes for a move to England.

Leicester have bid around £22m for the 19-year-old centre-back who is the number one target for their defence. 

Fofana has urged his club to accept Leicester's offer and said: 'I'd be crazy to say no to Leicester. 

Defender Wesley Fofana has urged St Etienne to allow him to join Leicester City this summer

'I am aware of taking a risk by leaving early abroad, but I'm determined and mentally ready. 

'By putting in that sum Leicester are proving they really want me.'

Leicester have watched Fofana for some time. 

The 19-year-old centre back is keen to make the move from France to the Premier League 

Though still raw, he is regarded as one of the best defensive prospects in Europe and has interest from AC Milan, Red Bull Leipzig and West Ham among others. 

Leicester hope Fofana's comments can help conclude a deal and want to add another winger before the window closes.
