His wedding to Katy Perry is on hold due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

But Orlando Bloom was already preparing to merge his family on Tuesday as he met up with Katy's father Keith Hudson in Los Angeles.

The 43-year-old Pirates Of The Caribbean star drove his early-1940s pickup truck to meet his future father-in-law for some coffee.

Orlando rocked a casual and rugged look for the meetup with a simple white T-shirt and olive-colored jeans.

He also had on brown suede boots and sported a white mask covered in swirling black lines to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. 

He drove to the coffee date in his gorgeously restored cyan pickup truck, which had bright yellow hubcabs.

The actor also had a pair of hydrofoil surfboards in the bed, though it's not clear if he and Keith were looking to catch some waves later in the day.

Unlike traditional surfboards, hydrofoil boards have a metal fin attached by a slim metal bar underneath the board.

The added foil allows surfers to ride their boards about two feet above the water's surface, and it gives them more control in windy or choppy conditions that might knock down surfers on normal boards. 

Orlando has likely been seeing a lot of his future in-laws following the birth of his daughter Daisy late last month.

The British actor and Katy introduced their bundle of joy to the world on Wednesday, August 26 via Unicef, for whom they serve as Goodwill Ambassadors. 

The humanitarian agency released a statement on behalf of the parents: 'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter. But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was.'

Orlando and the singer–songwriter have been together since January 2016, but their love story was temporarily paused when they split in February 2017.

However, the two worked out their differences and reunited a year later, and the two got engaged on Valentine's Day 2019.

The lovestruck couple revealed they were expecting their first child in March of this year, shortly before much of the US shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

On Sunday, Katy revealed on Instagram that her one-time nemesis Taylor Swift had sent her a lovely hand-embroidered blanket for her daughter.

Miss [Daisy] adores her hand embroidered blankie from miss @taylorswift,' she wrote. 'hope it’s one she drags around for years till it becomes an unrecognizable shred that she keeps in her pocket as a teenager ♥️.'

Last year, it was revealed that the Teenage Dream singer had ended her feud with Taylor when she appeared in the former country singer's video for You Need To Calm Down.
