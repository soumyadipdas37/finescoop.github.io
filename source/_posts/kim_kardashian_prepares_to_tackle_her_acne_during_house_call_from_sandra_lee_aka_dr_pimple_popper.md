She prepared to tackle her acne Monday, as she took to her Instagram Story during a visit from celebrity dermatologist and YouTube sensation Sandra Lee (AKA Dr. Pimple Popper).

She reportedly ushered in the end of KUWTK, as she and little sister Kylie Jenner, 23, both threatened to leave, forcing 'momager' Kris Jenner's hand. 

A source told The Sun that Kanye was her reason for quitting: 'The family have been locked in an ongoing debate over the future of the show for months now.

'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on. He's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'

Kim and the Yeezy mogul have been facing marital issues amid quarantine and his bizarre last-minute presidential bid, which has given the family cause for concern over his mental health.

Toxic environment: It came after sister Kourtney, 41, left the show back in March, later citing a 'toxic environment' to Vogue Arabia (pictured in February, 2016)

She posted a statement last week, announcing the end of KUWTK, which has become a cultural phenomenon since premiering in 2007. 

The Justice Project star wrote: 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.' 

It came after sister Kourtney, 41, left the show back in March, later citing a 'toxic environment' to Vogue Arabia.
