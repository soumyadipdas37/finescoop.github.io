The Bachelor's Juliette Herrera didn't shy away from name dropping when she revealed to Locky Gilbert who had been sliding into her DMs before she was brutally dumped by the Survivor star. 

And the 34-year-old can't seem to keep her mouth shut.     

On Thursday, the stylist claimed she has an inbox full of direct messages (DMs) from several interested suitors.

She told news.com.au she has been chatting with a rising rapper from the US, who has been signed to Young Thug and Machine Gun Kelly's record label. 

Juliette also alleged that she's been talking with a producer from American pop duo The Chainsmokers and a 'businessman with a nice car.'

Juliette also claimed she has received several messages from 24-year-old Spanish TikTok star Javi Luna. 

'I probably shouldn't have said his name, but there we go, it's out there now,' she said of the social media sensation, who has 9.2 million followers.

'I can't be in LA right now so it's a bit of a tease for me,' the stylist added of the other admirers messaging her.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Javi Luna for comment. 

On Wednesday, Juliette was brutally dumped by Locky after she confronted him at the cocktail party. 

She told producers: 'I thought, does he know that in my DMs I'm not replying to, like, certain people from LA?

Humble brag: 'I probably shouldn't have said his name, but there we go, it's out there now,' she said of the social media sensation, who has 9.2 million followers

'I could be, you know, talking to TikTok stars right now and my rappers, and I'm ignoring them. Like, I'm actually holding off for you.'

'Javi Luna, with 4 million TikTok followers, follows me and talks to me. And I'm here waiting for little old Locky,' she added.

'I have to remember who I am. Hello! I'm amazing! That's too confronting for Locky, then just get rid of me. 'Cause I've got DMs to go back to,' Juliette cheekily told producers, before she was seen in the back of a limo heading home.

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
