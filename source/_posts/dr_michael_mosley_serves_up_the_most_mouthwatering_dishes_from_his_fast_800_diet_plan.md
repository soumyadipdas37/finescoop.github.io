Don't wait to lose weight: You’ll feel better and live longer – and the best place to start is my delicious Fast 800 diet

With summer nearly over it would be easy to suck in your lockdown-expanded waistline and hope no one notices what you’re hiding under a baggy jumper. 

You probably know you might look and feel better if you lost a few excess pounds, but this year there’s the added threat of Covid-19. 

It’s now well established that catching the virus when you are obese, or you have raised blood sugar levels, means you are far more likely to end up in intensive care with life-threatening complications – particularly if you are middle-aged.

Dr Michael Mosley shared advice for following his Fast 800 plan to lose weight fast, as it's revealed two-thirds of British adults are overweight or obese. Pictured: Michael and his wife Clare Bailey

And there’s yet another reason to grasp the nettle: our best hope for defeating Covid-19 is a vaccine. But recent studies show that if you’re obese, a vaccine is far less likely to work than at a healthy weight. 

Too much body fat, especially around the waist, makes your immune system less efficient and less able to produce the antibodies needed to make the vaccine effective.

This is worrying because while two-thirds of British adults are overweight or obese, this rises to 78 per cent of British men and 70 per cent of British women over the age of 45 – and that also puts them at increased risk of developing serious conditions including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and several types of cancer.

So I was keen to team up with the Daily Mail to work on a brilliant Shape Up Britain challenge to inspire the nation to take positive steps to lose weight and reduce the risk of Covid-19 complications. 

The recent pandemic has spelt out how important it is not to carry too much weight – even the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is said to have attributed his own serious struggle with the coronavirus to being overweight. So the government is pushing new measures to reduce bulging waistlines.

After nearly a decade of researching and writing about diets and weight loss, I’m convinced the easiest, most effective way to reach and stick at a healthy weight is by starting on a low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diet in the short term, before switching to intermittent fasting and then a sustainable Mediterranean-style way of eating. 

Dr Michael explained the Fast 800 plan is designed for overweight or obese people who want to lose up to a stone in just three weeks. Pictured: Crispy fish fillet with sweet quinoa 

My Fast 800 plan is designed to be super-flexible to suit anyone who is overweight or obese and wants to lose weight fast (up to a stone in just three weeks), or someone who prefers a slower approach (1-2lb a week).

One of the great things about the Fast 800 is its flexibility. With the health-giving principles of the Mediterranean diet at its heart, it offers two different approaches which can be tailored to suit your lifestyle and your weight-loss goals:

You might want to start with The Very Fast 800 and move through to The New 5:2 as you lose weight, or you can jump in to The New 5:2 from the start.

This is a real-food lifestyle plan, designed to ensure you get maximum nutrients, eating delicious meals without feeling constantly hungry. 

The recipes have been created by Dr Clare Bailey (who just happens to be my wife) and the plan is backed by robust research.

In fact, Clare recently published a study with Professor Susan Jebb and researchers from Oxford University, which showed that, using this approach, overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes managed to safely lose 9.5kg (1.5st) on the Fast 800 plan in just eight weeks, and also dramatically improved their blood sugar levels.

To show you just how effective it can be, we have taken two completely different communities of people from different ends of the country and set them a challenge to see how healthy they could get in just eight weeks. 

Seventeen members of a Facebook friendship group based in Rotherham in South Yorkshire and 13 neighbours who live on one road in the Devon town of Chudleigh were challenged to shape up with my Fast 800 plan. 

The participants had a range of ages and body types, as well as health issues, so were the ideal candidates to show how it was done.

Before they started, we sent them off for a raft of health measurements and checks with Bupa Health Clinics to assess their diabetes risk, blood pressure and heart disease risk. The same tests were repeated after eight weeks on the plan. 

I’m delighted to tell you that the results have been astounding – as you will see in the ‘big reveals’ in today’s paper and all next week in the Daily Mail. 

Not only have both groups who took part in our challenge lost weight – some people have lost a lot of weight. The health checks have also shown a range of potentially life-changing health improvements.

Many have said the process has been much easier than they feared, and we hope their ringing endorsements will inspire you to join our Daily Mail Shape Up Britain challenge and galvanise your determination to change the way you eat and exercise. 

Dr Michael advises those who have type 2 diabetes to talk to their GP first because rapid weight loss can impact their medication (file image) 

We’re confident the stories you’ll read in the paper will help you realise that if they’ve managed it, you can too!

We have outlined here how the diet plans work – you’ll find everything you need to get started right away. If you have type 2 diabetes, or are on medication, talk to your GP first as rapid weight loss will have an impact on the medication you take. 

If you’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the last six years you might qualify for the NHS diabetes-reversal scheme which works on similar principles to the Fast 800 but uses soups and shakes instead of real food. 

The Mediterranean-style diet is free from added sugar and refined carbohydrates, with ingredients that have been scientifically proven to make you feel good, such as healthy fats like olive oil, protein (including pulses and fish) to keep you feeling full, milk and cheese, plus loads of fresh fruit and vegetables which are packed with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds.

The Fast 800 uses the fundamental principles of the Mediterranean diet by adapting them to aid weight loss. So you’ll find the recipes on the next few pages are high in protein and healthy fats (to help quell cravings), and relatively low in carbohydrates.

Just think – you could see significant improvements to your health from day one, shed that spare tyre in just a few weeks, and, in the long term, significantly reduce your risk of developing a number of serious diseases as well as Covid-19 complications as we move towards winter.

There has never been a better time to bite the bullet and make the lifestyle changes that could ensure a healthier future for you and those you love.

We’ve packed the following pages with tempting recipes – the favourites chosen time and time again by the thousands of people who have enjoyed success on the Fast 800 programme. 

You’ll find quick and easy suppers, filling lunches, and ideas for adapting menus so they can be enjoyed by the whole family. 

The recipes, many devised by my lovely wife Clare, are based on the fundamental principles of the Mediterranean-style diet – low in starchy carbohydrates, high in protein and packed with nutrients, as well as including healthy fats to keep you feeling full for longer.

Each recipe has been meticulously calorie-counted so you can incorporate it into the fast-tracked 800-calories-per-day plan, or, if you prefer the slightly slower 5:2 version of the Fast 800 plan, you can enjoy these recipes on ‘fast days’. 

On non-fast days and when you reach your weight-loss goal (or if you’re feeding the family) these recipes can be a staple of your everyday diet and enjoyed in slightly larger portions, with the optional addition of wholegrain carbohydrates such as brown rice, wholemeal bread or noodles.

There are more tasty recipes and health/weight-loss tips in the brilliant four-page pullouts every day in the paper next week as well as the personal testimonies of the volunteers who have successfully lost weight thanks to the Mail’s Shape Up Britain challenge. 

Find out how it has changed their lives, from dropping a clothes size to sleeping better and feeling more energised. As you’ll discover, a healthy diet is so much easier and more delicious to achieve than you might think. 

Dr Michael's wife Clare created a selection of recipes that can be incorporated into following the Fast 800 plan (file image) 

Recent studies have shown that sticking to about 800 calories per day is high enough to ensure you get all the nutrients you need for optimal health and to stop you feeling constantly hungry, but low enough to ensure rapid, safe, sustainable weight loss. 

Research shows that quick results are incredibly motivating and people who lose weight quickly are more likely to keep it off.

Rest assured you won’t run out of energy – your body has a huge supply of fuel around your tummy. 

Most of us have enough body fat to keep us going for months. It is when you really reduce your calories, particularly if on a low-carb diet, that your body switches into major fat-burning mode – starting with the fat stored around your abdominal area.

This is great news if you want to shrink your belly, and excellent news for your long-term health. 

Too much fat around your tummy causes inflammation throughout your body, which then increases your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, type 2 diabetes and other diseases of ageing. Losing inches around your waist can also bolster your immune system, energy levels and brain power.

Take a meal break

You can intensify the fat-burning and health benefits of Fast 800 by crunching your eating to within a 12-hour window (9am to 9pm or 10am to 10pm). This is called time-restricted eating (TRE) and there is lots of evidence that this is good for your health and weight-loss success.

Pioneering researchers such as Dr Satchin Panda of the world-renowned Salk Institute in California have discovered that by giving your body daily down-time from the work of eating and digesting, you can unlock powerful repair pathways that protect against illness, ageing and obesity.

There’s no need to fast all day – just skipping breakfast or eating your evening meal earlier is enough to extend your night-time ‘fast’. TRE gives the body ‘down-time’ from the work of metabolising food to engage deep-level tissue repair processes and the clearing out of old cells.

NOTE: The Fast 800 is only suitable for those who are overweight or obese. If you have any health concerns or you are taking medication, speak to your GP before embarking on the plan.
