Ofgem has fined SSE £2m fine for a power plant error. 

The energy regulator punished the provider for failing to publish information that is likely to have pushed up wholesale electricity costs. 

Fine: The energy regulator punished the provider for failing to publish information that is likely to have pushed up wholesale electricity costs

SSE said in February 2016 that it was going to shut three out of four units at Fiddler's Ferry, a coal-fired power plant in Cheshire. 

A week before the April 1 closing date, it signed a deal with National Grid that would keep the site on line. 

But it was not until the day before the units had been meant to shut down that SSE told the market. 

This resulted in four days' trading without the market knowing that more electricity was likely to be available than it was thought. SSE said it acted in 'good faith'.
