The wife of an Australian Defence Force soldier sobbed in court as he was found guilty of trying to trick a nurse into 'assisting' him provide a sperm sample.

Captain William Howieson was stationed at Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea in 2018 when he gave an unsigned doctor's note to a PNG army nurse saying she needed to help him produce five sperm samples.

While giving evidence at an ADF Court Martial in Canberra, the nurse said she refused the 29-year-old's proposition. 

She handed Captain Howieson a specimen jar and took him to a cubicle before telling him: 'You need to go and masturbate yourself in there', the court heard.

The nurse said he then told her 'but the paper says that you need to assist'. 

The jury on Tuesday found beyond a reasonable doubt that Captain Howieson brought discredit on the ADF. 

Captain Howieson's wife Bronte Millman - a vet from from Townsville - cried in court as the verdict was delivered, the Townsville Bulletin reported. 

During the trial the nurse also alleged Captain Howieson told her he had a lump in his groin and asked her to examine it in private. 

She told the court martial there was no lump, and said he pulled down his pants. 

However, the court found Captain Howieson not guilty of those allegations, the ABC reported.

Defence Force Magistrate Brigadier Michael Cowen QC told the panel it might conclude Captain Howieson's offending had 'a rather brazen element to it'.

He said Captain Howieson, who previously had a perfect service record, was a 'mature man who doesn't have the folly of youth on his side'.

Prosecutors told the court it was clear the act had been premeditated.

Chief Judge Advocate Brigadier Michael Cowan said Captain Howieson's role as a liaison officer and responsibility of controlling a large amount of money gave him confidence in his position.  

'You may think that that confidence emboldened him to commit the offence,' he said. 

Captain Howieson faces a maximum sentence of three months behind bars, or a fine and demotion.   

He will be sentenced later this week.
