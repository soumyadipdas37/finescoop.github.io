She's previously been forced to deny claims that she joined The Bachelor in search of fame rather than to find love.

And as of Wednesday, Bella Varelis has gained a total of 56,469 followers on Instagram in the six weeks since she debuted on the Channel 10 dating show.

And while Bella's character has taken a turn in the last few episodes, that hasn't stopped fans from deciding to follow the brunette on social media.

It's unclear if Bella or the other finalists have been buying followers to boost their social media profiles, or if their exposure on the show is authentically bringing them new fans and followers.

Meanwhile, Bec Cvilikas' follower count is also on the rise.

Earlier this year, Bella publicly slammed allegations she was an aspiring actress who once dreamt of moving to LA to further her career.

'I've never moved to LA, I've never wanted or tried to be an actress in Australia, never wanted or tried to get work as an actress in LA and certainly am not acting on the Bachelor,' she wrote on Instagram.

The Bachelor continues on Wednesday at 7.30pm on TEN
