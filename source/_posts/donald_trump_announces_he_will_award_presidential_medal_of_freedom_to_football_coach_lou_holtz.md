President Trump has announced he will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, to longtime college football coach Lou Holtz. 

Trump made the announcement on Friday during a White House press conference where Holtz was in attendance. 

The president did not announce a date for the ceremony but said it 'won't be in the too distant future.'

Trump said he had received letters from football coaches across the country, as well as other people, recommending Holtz, 83, for the honor. 

During a White House press briefing on Friday, Trump announced he will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to longtime college football coach Lou Holtz (pictured right during the announcement) 

Trump said he's known Holtz for a 'long time' and called him a friend and an 'incredible leader.' They are pictured together during a campaign rally in 2018

'We've analyzed it very closely. We've looked at all those recommendations. We've looked at Lou's life and his career and what he's done for charity, and the football is obvious,' Trump said. 

'He was a great coach but what he's done beyond even coaching, so Lou will be getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom.'

Holtz spent 34 years coaching both college and professional football teams and is perhaps best known for an 11-season stint as Notre Dame's head coach. 

Holtz ended his career at the University of South Carolina, where he was head coach for six seasons from 1999-2004.

He coached the New York Jets in 1976.

Days earlier, the longtime football coach was among the speakers at the Republican National Convention last week, where he gave a speech insulting Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, saying he was a Catholic 'in name only'

The West Virginia native has voiced his support for the president over the years and was among the speakers at last week's Republican National Convention. 

In his remarks, Holtz called Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden a Catholic 'in name only.' Biden is a practicing Catholic.

'One of the important reasons he has my trust is because nobody has been a stronger advocate for the unborn than President Trump,' Holtz said last week. 

He called the Biden-Harris ticket 'the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history.'

Holtz defended his remarks days later during an interview on Fox News where he criticized Biden's stance on abortion.

'People have taught me that to murder an unborn child at nine months is illegal,' Holtz said on Bill Hemmer Reports.

'That's not part of the Catholic faith. And Joe Biden - he may be a wonderful individual, I hear great things about him - I'm not casting aspersions on his character, his integrity, but I am casting aspersions on his decision.'

Notre Dame's president, Reverend John I. Jenkins, later issued a statement admonishing the former coach for using the university's name in his remarks.

Jenkins said it 'must not be taken to imply' that Notre Dame endorses Holtz's views, any candidate or any political party.

Jenkins also admonished Holtz for questioning the 'sincerity' of the former vice president's faith.
