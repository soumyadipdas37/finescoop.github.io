Embattled star Ellen DeGeneres has revealed she is bringing back her talk show, amid her toxic workplace scandal, which she will address when it airs later this month. 

'I can't wait to get back to work and back to our studio. And, yes, we're gonna talk about it,' said DeGeneres in a press statement on Tuesday, referring to the current investigation going on.  

Despite the controversy, The Ellen DeGeneres Show returns for Season 18 on Monday, September 21st, and will resume filming from the ELLEN stage on the Warner Bros. lot without an in-studio audience.

DeGeneres, 62, has even secured her guests for the new series that will include Tiffany Haddish, Kerry Washington, Alec Baldwin, Chrissy Teigen, Chris Rock, Amy Schumer, Adam Sandler, and Orlando Bloom. 

It was also revealed in the statement that Stephen “tWitch” Boss will a guest host upcoming episodes, though it is unclear if this means he will be taking the place of DeGeneres in selective episodes. 

Last month, executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman were all fired from the popular talk show following accusations leveled against them by current and former staffers.
