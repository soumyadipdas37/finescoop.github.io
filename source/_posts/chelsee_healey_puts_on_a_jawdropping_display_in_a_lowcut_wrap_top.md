She never fails to turn heads in her daring ensembles. 

And Chelsee Healey put on a jaw-dropping display in a plunging white wrap shirt as she stepped out for an evening at San Carlos in Hale, Cheshire, on Sunday.

The Hollyoaks star, 32, flaunted her toned pins in tight cream shorts and opted for tan suede knee-high boots to keep all eyes on her figure.

A radiant Chelsee beamed as she posed in the neutral ensemble for the glamorous occasion at the Italian restaurant.  

The buttoned-down top featured a plunging neckline which allowed Chelsee's ample cleavage to be on display. 

The former Strictly Come Dancing star opted for a statement gold chain necklace and matching hoop earrings as she kept all eyes on her décolletage.

Her outing comes as Hollyoaks resumed filming in July after it was forced to suspend production for four months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bosses confirmed stars returned to the soap's Liverpool set, with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place.   

Hollyoaks announced that episodes would increase from two nights a week to four from September.
