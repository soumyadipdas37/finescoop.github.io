Olly Murs and fellow celebrity players showed their support towards the Black Lives Matter movement at annual charity game Soccer Aid at Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday.

The captain for the England football team, 36, knelt to the ground alongside the likes of teammate Danny Jones and Rest of The World players DJ Locksmith and guitarist Sergio Pizzorno as a powerful symbol against racism.

Black Lives Matter has been recognised worldwide in recent months after a video surfaced of a white officer Derek Chauvin killing unarmed black man George Floyd by crushing his neck with his knee in Minneapolis back in May.

American footballer Colin Kaepernick's national anthem kneeling protest staged in 2016 has since become synonymous with the movement. 

Sky Sports pundit Alex Scott has urged English football to press on with support for the campaign next season.

The former Arsenal women's star said clubs, players and staff should continue their displays against discrimination after a year that has seen the world of sport play a huge part in bringing awareness by striking, taking a knee before games and wearing the movement's message on jerseys.

The death of George triggered protests around the world and those demonstrations reached many sports - with the Premier League featuring Black Lives Matter on shirts instead of player names.

Clubs kneeled before each game in the restart and there are plans to keep that show of support going for the 2020-21 campaign.

'We still need to keep the Black Lives Matter movement going,' former Strictly star Alex, 35, said after England's 1-0 win over Iceland in the Nations League on Saturday. 

'Basketball players in the play-offs are boycotting games. We just need to keep going. We need to keep it at the forefront of people's conversation. So any opportunity we can, we need to shine a light on it.' 

Earlier in the event, Olly was left disappointed as Olivia Colman declined his offer to join the England football team.

Speaking via a video call, he attempted to persuade the award-winning actress, 46, to play in the match, but the screen star made it clear she'd only be interested in taking part in TV, theatre and film roles.

The Voice judge later reached out to will.i.am, Dolly Parton, Alan Carr, Alison Hammond and Rylan Clark-Neal, before settling with comedian Joel Dommett.

The funny sketch kicked off with the former X Factor star approaching manager Sam Allardyce, joined by fellow coach Wayne Rooney, for advice on who to recruit for the group.

Olly's description of the job clearly confused The Crown star Olivia, who believed she was signing up for an acting stint. 

'Do you have a script you can send me? I can research the striker and it can grow originally! Do you have Dame Judi on board?', the thespian asked, before the musician said: 'Just Mark Wright!'

An unimpressed Olivia boldly replied: 'I think I'll pass!'

Eager: The desperate artist later called other celebrities, including Alan Carr and Alison Hammond, who both refused to take part

The desperate artist later called host Alan, 44, and This Morning's Alison, 45, who said respectively: 'Yes, I will manage your England team. My dad used to manage Northampton footcball club... I'm talking about my singing career, not football!' 

Failing to find potential teammates, former Big Brother presenter Rylan, 31, added salt to the wound as he asked: 'I haven't got to wear one of them football shirts do I?, before American singer Dolly, 74, admitted: 'Sorry Olly, I'm working 9 to 5!'

Olly's fellow The Voice coach will.i.am, 45, was enthusiastic for the wrong reasons as he suggested: 'Every time we score, I want to sing and change our outfits. Who else is playing that sings? Come on bro, most of the time you're just on Instagram!'

The media personality was left to take in The Masked Singer UK's Joel, 35, who put on a goofy display by wearing a David Beckham face mask while revealing he was more than excited to join the team.

Elsewhere in the event, the Troublemaker hitmaker enthused about participating in the important match for six years in a row. 

The TV star said: 'It's different from previous soccer aids. It feel as amazing to be captain, I feel very lucky.'

The Body Coach Joe Wicks surprised host Kirsty Gallacher as he confessed he struggled to keep up with his teammates during training for the game, despite keeping the nation fit with his daily P.E. exercise sessions. 

The fitness enthusiast, 33, said: 'Everyone assumes I'm the Body Coach but I'm not match-fit. My body is aching and I'm not used to this!'   

Football pundit for the night Maya Jama commentated on the match alongside comedian Omid Djalili, footballer Alex Scott and host Dermot O'Leary

Robbie Williams, who initiated Soccer Aid 14 years ago, said via live link: 'I'm really well. This year has been one of the weirdest years on record. 

'I always thought at least I got Soccer Aid but as I went on holiday I got put on the travel ban. The game is a bit slow but it's fantastic entertainment. We're here for the tackles. 

'It's made me emotional see how far Soccer Aid has come. I'm very proud and patriotic.' 

England XI featured Olly, Mark, David James, John Bishop (Pady McGuinness), Wes Brown, John Terry, Gareth Barry, Katie Chapman, Danny Jones (Yung Filly), Kelly Smith and Tom Davis (Chunkz) (Lee Mack). 



Rest of the World XI, meanwhile, starred captain Mo Gilligan, Shay Given, Locksmith, Mikael Silvestre, Patrice Evra, Michael Essien, Dermot Kennedy, Jeremy Lynch, Chelcee Grimes, Lianne Sanderson and Serge Pizzorno (Kem Cetinay).

Harry Redknapp returned to manage the side, along with Bryan Robson and Vic Bettinelli. 

The annual charity fundraiser saw former players and prominent celebrities join forces in an 11-a-side match which is hosted in conjunction with UNICEF.
