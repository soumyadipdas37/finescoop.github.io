Gemma Collins was spotted out in her native Essex on Tuesday, shortly after it was revealed she has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. 

The TOWIE star, 39, cut a low-key figure in a tracksuit as she picked up essentials while stepping out hot on the heels of news she has been tipped for the award. 

Gemma has been put forward for the prestigious award by two YouTube pranksters, who have started up The Romford Research Institute For Peace to make themselves qualify to have the power to nominate.

Gemma looked unfazed by her new dizzying height of stardom as she emerged in a black ensemble while sporting a protective mask over her face. 

The blonde beauty clutched an iced beverage and a bag from M&S as she headed to her swanky white Range Rover amid the news about her nomination.

Company directors Josh Pieters and Archie Manners insist the reality personality has spent much of her life dedicated to finding peace, and even referenced her relationship with James Argent as a point of her peace-finding ability. 

The YouTube duo have hit headlines previously with such stunts as interviewing Carole Baskin and tricking Love Island's Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury into believing James Corden is interviewing them for America's The Late Late Show.

Drink up! She was getting her caffeine fix 

One of the criteria to have the ability to nominate an individual is to be a 'director of a peace research institute'. This is the category Josh and Archie fall under. 

Speaking to The Sun, the duo, both 27, said: 'The GC has spent 39 years promoting peace and harmony across Essex – and beyond. If you look at what peace really means, take for example her on-off relationship with James Argent – no one died....

'It was a conflict that did appear to be resolved peacefully and we at the Romford Research Institute think this is a great demonstration of world peace.'

Josh explained: 'We believe in the GC effect, which is a peer reviewed hypothesis that if Gemma spent a long weekend in North Korea she could use the skills as seen in Towie to attempt to bring peace to the region.'

Peace out: Speaking to The Sun , the duo, both 27, said: 'The GC has spent 39 years promoting peace and harmony across Essex – and beyond. If you look at what peace really means, take for example her on-off relationship with James Argent – no one died'

Archie added: 'She is arguably more peaceful than Donald Trump. And it's the same with Kanye West. His nomination has been successful and he will be considered.' 

The duo's pranks have become prolific, with their Carole and Molly-Mae pranks following on from them luring Katie Hopkins abroad to be given a fake award which spelled out the words 'C*NT'.

Trump's nomination has caused controversy after a Swedish legislator put the President's name forward for the 2021 awards. 

A legislator nominated Trump for his efforts in the Middle East and has said he received a phone call of thanks from the US president.

The GC Effect: Josh explained: 'We believe in the GC effect, which is a peer reviewed hypothesis that if Gemma spent a long weekend in North Korea she could use the skills as seen in Towie to attempt to bring peace to the region'

Out and about: She was joined by a friend as she emerged 

Magnus Jacobsson, a member of Sweden’s Parliament for the Christian Democrats, wrote on Twitter that he was “on my way to the stable with my daughter” when he got the call.

“We had a good conversation about peace in the Middle East and the Balkans. I wish the President good luck with the peace processes,” Mr Jacobsson wrote.

Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed last month to a deal normalising relations that was signed at the White House on September 15.

Earlier this month, Mr Jacobsson also nominated the governments of the US, Kosovo and Serbia for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to secure a peace agreement between the two former Balkan war foes.
