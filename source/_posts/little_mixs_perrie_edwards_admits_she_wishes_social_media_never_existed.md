Perrie Edwards has admitted she wishes that social media 'didn't exist' as she describes the networking platforms as a 'blessing and a curse'.

The Little Mix star, 27, also revealed how she combats becoming 'obsessed' with Instagram during an appearance on BBC Breakfast.

The singer, who performs in the band alongside Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall, said she bans herself from checking social media first thing in the morning.

She said: 'There isn't too much about it that's decent. I just wish it never existed.'

Explaining her sense of 'guilt', when she doesn't post however, Perrie said: 'I feel guilty when I don't post enough. I feel bad for our fans that do want to see us post. It's trying to find a balance.' 

'When I wake up I've got a little ban on my phone so I can't get on it past 10 am. It's actually really good because then you're not obsessed over it. Social media is a blessing and a curse. For us it's such a big platform and hugely beneficial.'   

Jesy - who has been open about her experiences at the hands of cruel online trolls - feels that the group are 'a lot better' with social media than in the past.

She said: 'I think we're a lot better with social media than what we used to be. I think we're not on it as much as we used to be, we're not as obsessed with it. 

'I can't be on it all the time because I know, for me, mentally it's not good. I admire people who don't have social media. I think it's so refreshing when I meet people that don't have it.' 

The band released a video for their latest single Holiday last month, in which Perrie accessorises in a stunning bubble-inspired headpiece that she recently shared a snap of with her fans.

The band shared the front cover of their new album on Instagram for the first time last week.

The girls looked sensational as they posed up a storm wearing only glitter on their faces in the sizzling new artwork. 

Sharing the snap, they wrote: 'So much love, emotion and energy has gone into the making of this record and now the news is out we can finally get excited about it with you!!'

Little Mix's previous albums are DNA, Salute, Get Weird, Glory Days and their most recent offering LM5 in 2018.

The band's recent recent publicity push will be a welcome change for Perrie, after she was forced to spend much of August in quarantine following a trip to Ibiza due with boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. 

The couple made their relationship Instagram official in January 2017 and spent all of lockdown together.
