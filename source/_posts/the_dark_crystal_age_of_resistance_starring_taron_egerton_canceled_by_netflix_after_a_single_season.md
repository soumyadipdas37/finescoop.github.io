Netflix has chosen not to renew its fantasy series The Dark Crystal: Age Of Resistance after a single season.

The series served as a prequel to Jim Henson's 1982 fantasy film The Dark Crystal, which has become a cult classic among fantasy fans in recent years. 

The streaming service and the Jim Henson Company CEO and Executive Producer Lisa Henson initially announced the information to io9.

Henson, the daughter of legendary Muppets creator Jim Henson, issued a statement thanking fans for supporting the series and suggesting the company might pursue other ways to continue the story.

'We can confirm that there will not be an additional season of The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. We know fans are eager to learn how this chapter of The Dark Crystal saga concludes and we’ll look for ways to tell that story in the future,' she wrote. 

'Our company has a legacy of creating rich and complex worlds that require technical innovation, artistic excellence, and masterful storytelling. Our history also includes productions that are enduring, often finding and growing their audience over time and proving again and again that fantasy and science fiction genres reflect eternal messages and truths that are always relevant,' she continued.

Henson concluded her statement by thanking Netflix and noting that Age Of Resistance won the Emmy award for Outstanding Children's Program at the 72nd Primetime Emmys.

Netflix shared its own statement thanking everyone involved with Age Of Resistance's production.

'We are grateful to the master artists at the Jim Henson Company for bringing The Dark Crystal: Age Of Resistance to life for fans around the world. We’re thankful to the executive producers Lisa Henson and Halle Stanford, and Louis Leterrier, who also directed all episodes, as well as the writers, cast and crew for their outstanding work and thrilled they were recognized with the Emmy this weekend.' 

Age Of Resistance debuted on Netflix in August 2019 with an impressive voice cast featuring Taron Egerton, Split's Anya Taylor-Joy, Game Of Throne's Nathalie Emmanuel, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Caitriona Balfe, Jason Isaacs and Mark Hamill, among many others.

The series also featured state-of-the-art puppetry that continued the Henson Company's history of innovation in the art form.

Fans of the series will likely be disappointed in the surprise cancellation, as the first season ended on a cliffhanger.

 Earlier this month, The Hollywood Reporter noted that Age Of Resistance was considered an 'expensive disappointment' by top executives at Netflix.

The films alleged lack of viewers and large productions costs were cited as potential reasons for the ouster of Netflix TV executive Cindy Holland, who had been with the streaming service for 20 years.
