Gareth Southgate's England team will show their support for the Black Lives Matter movement on the international stage, as they plan to take the knee ahead of upcoming UEFA Nations League matches.

The Three Lions are already preparing at their St George's base, ahead of clashes against Iceland and Denmark which begin on Saturday.

Southgate's side will be making the gesture, which has been carried out by footballers across the country following the return of the sport from its coronavirus postponement.

Prior to kick off against Iceland inÂ Reykjavik, England players will drop to the turf in what will be the first instance of the support being shown on the international stage.

As Southgate's squad convened together this week to make their preparations, it has been reported that an item for discussion was whether to continue to show solidarity with the gesture.

Players in the England squad unanimously agreed that the taking of the knee should continue in order to provide a powerful symbol, as report Sky Sports.

The gesture will be made, however, the England shirts will not contain the Black Lives Matter (BLM) logo as has been the case in the Premier League.

UEFA rules dictate that no political logo or message should appear on match shirts in their competitions.

It is expected to soon be widely debated as to whether the BLM campaign should be seen as political or purely humanitarian.

Manchester United youngster Mason Greenwood, who has received his first call up to the senior ranks, feels it is a good thing that the gesture continues.

He said: 'It's good that the Premier League are trying to send that message out there.

'It's a big thing now in football that everyone notices, a lot of people watch football. It will send a good message out.

'For my part, I'd like to see it next season as well.'
