Arturo Vidal is expected to become Inter Milan's newest signing early next week after Barcelona agreed to terminate his contract, according to reports.

The combative 33-year-old was told to find a new club by Ronald Koeman after his arrival earlier this summer - and the Nou Camp giants are even willing to rip up his deal and allow him to leave a year early.

Catalan newspaper Sport have reported that Vidal will jet out to Milan to undertake his medical on Monday or Tuesday ahead of finalising the free transfer.

Antonio Conte has been keen to reunite with Vidal after he was made surplus to requirements

Vidal has become an unwanted player amid Barcelona's planned first-team exodus, despite making 43 appearances last season, and Koeman is determined to cut the wage bill at the club.

The Chile international cut a visibly frustrated figure during the Champions League humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich and will soon fall victim to Koeman's radical overhaul. 

His imminent departure will allow him to take up a new challenge. It is believed that negotiations with Inter are in their final stages, and the midfielder has also thrashed out personal terms. 

Barcelona may demand a minor payment from Inter despite letting Vidal leave for nothing, in a similar move to when Ivan Rakitic rejoined Sevilla earlier this week.

Antonio Conte has been keen to reunite with Vidal in his second season at the helm of Inter, having coached him at Juventus. 

The 51-year-old brought in the player from Bayer Leverkusen in 2011 and made him an integral part of his project in Turin.

Vidal netted 40 goals and laid on 21 assists in 126 games under Conte, and the enigmatic tactician will be hopeful the star can help lead his team to the Serie A title next season. 

Inter begin pre-season training on Monday and will hope Vidal will be available for the sessions.
