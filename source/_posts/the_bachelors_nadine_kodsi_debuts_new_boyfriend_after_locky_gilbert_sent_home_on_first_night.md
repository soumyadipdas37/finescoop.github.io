Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert didn't see an immediate romantic connection with her and sent her packing on the first night of The Bachelor.

But Nadine Kodsi has proved she's moved on from her short-lived TV heartbreak, as she debuted her new romance on Instagram on Monday.

Sporting a heavy filter during a trip to a pier, the 30-year-old cosied up to her new man who she adoringly dubbed her 'forever'.

Despite not revealing his identity, Nadine looked smitten as she tightly hugged her other half as he looked out at the waterfront.

'The sun will always shine with you. You're my forever,' she added a gushing caption.

Meanwhile, as well as finding love, Nadine has seemed to transform her whole appearance since exiting the show.

In a recent selfie, the brunette sported an oversized pout that looked nothing like her regular-sized lips from The Bachelor.

While some may assume that her pout is the result of fillers, Nadine insists that her plump appearance is down to makeup and filters. 

'It's not surgery, they're my lips,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's makeup and filters, but the bigger the better!'

Since leaving The Bachelor mansion, the glamorous Nadine has earned attention for looking like Married At First Sight's Martha Kalifatidis.

The pair have similar features and a passion for fashion, and even share near identical usernames on Instagram.

Lebanese stunner Nadine goes by @nadinee__k on the social media site, while Greek beauty Martha is known as @marthaa__k to her 340,000 followers. 

Nadine recently revealed that she has no plans to appear on Bachelor in Paradise - or any other reality show for that matter.

'It's not surgery, they're my lips,' Nadine told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's makeup and filters, but the bigger the better!'

'I have a life outside of The Bachelor,' the 30-year-old told Daily Mail Australia last month when asked if she would consider returning to the franchise. 

The brunette beauty, who has a degree in criminology, has since returned to her day job as a fashion entrepreneur.

Nadine has been an outspoken critic of Locky and the entire Bachelor franchise since her exit.

Last month, she called Locky a 'production puppet' after he was seen with the earpiece on the So Dramatic podcast.
