The nation was left shocked last week when The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert told both finalists he was in love with them - only to dump Bella Varelis and choose Irena Srbinovska as his winner.

And it appears the cast of Gogglebox were equally as stunned by the ending, with their hilarious reactions set to air on Channel 10 on Thursday night.

In a trailer for the episode, Vestal Delpechitra describes the finale as 'mental', as the other households watch in disbelief as Locky makes his gut-wrenching decision.

Shocked! Viewers were left gobsmacked during The Bachelor finale, as Locky Gilbert (pictured) told BOTH finalists he had fallen for them, before eventually choosing Irena Srbinovska as his winner

The trailer begins with Sarah Marie and Matty Fahd and their pal Jad eagerly awaiting the episode, as Matty screams out: 'Bachelor finale, baby!'

As footage is shown of Locky telling both women he's in love, Vestal shouts: 'This is mental, because now both girls think they're the winners!'

Anastasia Katselas then offers a hilarious solution to Locky's problem by suggesting he try a 'ménage à trois' with both women.

The screen then cuts to Di, who cackles at Locky's indecision.

Shook! As footage appeared on-screen of Locky declaring his love for both women, Vestal Delpechitra (far left) shouted: 'This is mental, because now both girls think they're the winners!'

After the Bachelor finale aired, fans expressed their disapproval that Locky would declare his love for both women, knowing he'd have to break up with one of them.

One viewer tweeted: 'I don't agree with his telling them both he loves them pretty silly poor girls heading for heartbreak.'

'To be honest - I would not want a man who was in love with another woman at the same time as me – and struggled to chose between us,' another added.

'He has no idea what being in love is!' Bachelor fans slammed Locky for telling Bella and Irena he's falling in love with them, labelling him 'emotionally immature'

A third agreed: 'It's not true soul love if you are in love with two women. True love is the one and only, Locky is the emotionally immature one, not the girls.'

'Locky is in love with the idea of being in love. Being in love with two people is not real love. He has no idea what being in love is. I couldn't be with someone who isn't solely in love with me,' a fourth wrote. 

Gogglebox Australia airs Thursday at 8:30pm on Channel 10

Bizarre: In a confusing twist and just hours after telling Irena the same thing, Locky had told Bella: 'Babe, I'm definitely falling in love with you'
