Australian actress Teresa Palmer's look-a-like son Bodhi, six, is following in his mother's footsteps. 

The youngster made his acting debut in The Place of No Words alongside his famous parents.

Appearing in a newly released trailer, Bodhi kicks off an epic journey that leads his family on an imaginative adventure through lands filled with mythic creatures.

The movie was written by Teresa's husband Mark Webber, who also stars in the film.

The Australian actress recently shared her excitement upon learning the film will finally get a release, after it premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2019.

'Thrilled is an understatement, We believe in the message of this film so much, especially now,' she wrote in a statement shared to Instagram on Thursday. 

'The place of no words is a truly profound and poetic exploration of life and death in all its complexities.
