Tottenham's woes have continued as Jose Mourinho confirmed Son Heung-Min was withdrawn at half-time of their 1-1 draw with Newcastle with a hamstring injury.

The South Korean winger started Spurs' draw at home to the Magpies and played a key role in a dominant opening period, hitting the woodwork twice though did not appear for the second-half.

Son was just getting into his stride and scored four goals in the north Londoners' 5-2 win over Southampton last weekend to open his account for the season. His latest injury will keep him out for several weeks, according to Mourinho.

Son Heung-Min suffered a hamstring injury in Tottenham's 1-1 draw with Newcastle on Sunday

In his post-match press conference, the Portuguese boss said: 'It's an injury. We'll have him out for a while. It's his hamstring.'

Spurs were already reeling from throwing away two points on Sunday afternoon due to a controversial penalty awarded to the visitors. 

Eric Dier was deemed to have handled the ball from Andy Carroll's knock down even though the defender was not even looking at the ball.

Spurs were already reeling from Callum Wilson's late penalty after a controversial VAR call

After a lengthy VAR stoppage, referee Peter Bankes awarded the penalty much to the dismay of Mourinho, who stormed down the tunnel when Callum Wilson dispatched the stoppage time equaliser. 

Spurs are currently in the middle of a busy fixture list filled with Europa League qualifiers - a situation that was handed to Spurs after north London rivals Arsenal won the FA Cup which took them straight to the European group stages.

Son started and scored in Thursday night's qualifier away at Macedonian First Division leaders KF Shkendija. Spurs now have to host Chelsea in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday before taking on Israeli side Maccabi Haifa 48 hours later. 

Their fixture list would have been even more hectic had last Tuesday's League Cup tie away at Leyton Orient not been called off due to the League Two side picking up several coronavirus cases in their playing squad.
