She is known for her fashion forward style.

And on Friday, Pip Edwards opted for a classy black and white ensemble for a night out with friends.

One could mistake the 40-year-old P.E. Nation founder's outfit for something inspired by a nun's habit - but it was far from it.

Simply divine! Fashion designer Pip Edwards (pictured) looked stylish in a classy black and white ensemble for a night out on Friday

She posted a mirror selfie of her outfit - a long black dress with a white neckline trim and cut out details on the waist.

Over the dress, the fashion designer wore a cropped bomber jacket and completed her look with a pair of white boots.

Pip's avant garde ensemble comes after she recently shared a sweet photo of herself cuddled up to her boyfriend, cricketer Michael Clarke.

In the photo, former Australian cricket captain Michael, 39, was seen wrapping his arm around the business mogul's neck and tenderly caressing her arm.

Pip was barefoot in the impressive closet, wearing a pair of baggy casual black trousers and a white tank top.

Meanwhile, Michael was sporty in black shorts, an olive green T-shirt and Off White Nike sneakers.

Co-parents: Reports surfaced Michael had begun dating Pip after his separation with Kyly became public knowledge.

The sporting great had separated from Kyly, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12. 

The Clarkes have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their daughter Kelsey Lee.

Pip seemingly confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, and the pair enjoyed a PDA-filled trip to Noosa, Queensland that same month.
