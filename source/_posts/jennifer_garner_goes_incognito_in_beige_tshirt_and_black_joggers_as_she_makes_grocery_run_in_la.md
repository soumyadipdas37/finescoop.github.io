Jennifer Garner has been enjoying some quality family time at home during the summer quarantine with her kids.

But the Golden Globe winner is a mom-on-the-go once again, as kids get back to virtual learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

She went incognito in beige Sunday, as she masked up to make a grocery run in the upscale Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, during a break from homeschool.

The 48-year-old sported a beige t-shirt with some skintight black joggers and a pair of blue trainers.

She covered her face with a grey baseball cap, black wayfarer sunglasses and a printed face mask, finishing the ensemble with black Apple Watch.

Not present for the weekend outing were Garner's daughters Violet, 14, Seraphina, 11, and son Samuel, eight.

She recently squashed a pregnancy rumor before it had the chance to catch on, after posting a video in overalls from her family's farm in Oklahoma.

One of her 9.7million Instagram followers asked a bold question in the comment section: 'Are you pregnant?'

The Alias star responded: 'I am 48, have three healthy kids, and am not—and never will be—pregnant. We can lay that pupper to rest. Have a gained the Covid 19? Possibly. But that is another story.'

Garner posted a tribute to educators earlier this month on Instagram, writing: 'Thank you for the gifts and lessons of this summer. God bless teachers, faculty and administrators as they guide us through this big question mark of a school year.

'Bless the parents trying to make it all work. And the children who are learning to make the best of things in ways we couldn’t have predicted. Help us remember we hold each other in our hands. And please God, preserve our collective sense of humor. Amen.'
