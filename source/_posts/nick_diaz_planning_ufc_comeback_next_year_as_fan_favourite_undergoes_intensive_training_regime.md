UFC fan favourite Nick Diaz is planning a sensational return to the octagon next year. 

Diaz, brother of Nate, has been out of action for five years but the eccentric Stockton fighter is working hard on a comeback. 

His manager Kevin Mubenga confirmed to Ariel Helwani that Diaz is '100 per cent' planning to fight again in 2021 and currently weighs in the '175-165 pound range'.

Nick Diaz looks in superb condition and is preparing for a UFC comeback in 2021 

Manny believed Diaz would never fight competitively in MMA again after he was banned and fined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in 2015 for failing a drug test of marijuana metabolites. 

But if the latest information and short clip are anything to go by then Diaz means business and is looking for fights at welterweight again. 

He has been working hard on a 14-week training camp and even performed a test weight cut. 

Diaz, 37, last fought in 2015 against Anderson Silva but both of them failed drugs tests 

In a short video shared by Helwani, Diaz looks in fantastic condition as he poses for the camera. 

Diaz's last contest was a unanimous decision defeat by MMA legend Anderson Silva but it was later ruled a no contest after they both failed drugs tests. 

Initially, Diaz was given a massive five year ban but that was later reduced and he has been free to compete again for the last four years. 

In the mean time, he has been supporting his brother Nate, who shot to elevated levels of fame with his two fights against Conor McGregor, producing a stunning submission in the first before losing a decision in the rematch.
