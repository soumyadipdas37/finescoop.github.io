Molly-Mae was putting on a show-stopping display as she posed up a storm in a sheer mini dress with a matching head scarf.  

She scraped her hair into a high ponytail in another shot in a leg-flashing mini dress with lace-up cream heels which further highlighted her pins.  

On the line, she said: 'I feel so excited and lucky to be still working with PrettyLittleThing one year on and creating collections that I absolutely love.'

Praising the brand values, she went on: 'I love everything that PLT stands for and it's amazing to be bringing out another Edit with them.'

Love it! On the line, she said: 'I feel so excited and lucky to be still working with PrettyLittleThing one year on and creating collections that I absolutely love'

Away from her work, Molly-Mae visited Crete earlier in August with fellow Love Islander, Maura Higgins, their hairstylist friend Jay Birmingham and Molly's sister Zoe.

She revealed on Youtube that the group were 'scared for their lives' and 'nearly died' as huge waves crashed against their yacht while they were out at sea.

Visibly shaken in the video, the blonde beauty explained: 'Guys this might be the last blog entry I ever do. We're all scared for our lives. We're on the boat and I have never seen waves like it.

'Zoe was crying a second ago. The drivers are drenched, we're drenched. I'm not being funny but they've not told us about any life jackets, we just set off and now we're sat inside the boat trying to hide from the waves.' 

In the video, Molly-Mae also showed her three friends looking nervous on the boat with Maura screaming and exclaiming that she was 'going to get sick'.
