Paul Merson has slammed Manchester United's decision to sign Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek, branding the Red Devils' new midfield man as a 'panic buy'. 

The 23-year-old arrived at Old Trafford on a £40million deal this week from the Dutch giants, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made his first foray into the summer transfer window.

Van de Beek is set to link-up with fellow United stars Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba in the heart of Solskjaer's team, but Sky Sports pundit Merson believes that the Dutchman has only arrived as the club want to please the supporters with any new signing.

Merson thinks Manchester United only bought Van de Beek to appease the fans with a signing 

Merson told the Daily Star: 'Donny van de Beek looks like a panic buy at Manchester United. I don't get it. 

'They just spent £40m on a position where they are already strong and how does he play with Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes?

'You have to have someone who can play the holding role. That signing looked to me like: "Oh we haven’t bought anyone yet, let’s go and buy someone, who can we get?"'

Before signing Van de Beek, Manchester United were frustrated in the transfer window having failed to capture winger Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.

The 20-year-old England international was the subject of a bid by the Red Devils but failed to agree a fee with Dortmund before the German club's August 10 deadline to conclude the deal.

Solskjaer and his side could return for Sancho between now and the end of the transfer window on October 5. They have also been linked with RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano this summer.  

Van de Beek played 175 times for Dutch giants Ajax, scoring 41 goals for his boyhood club

Van de Beek arrives at Old Trafford having come through the ranks of boyhood club Ajax. The 23-year-old made 175 appearances for the Ajax first-team, scoring 41 goals.

He was part of the side that reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2019 and scored in every single knockout round leading up to the last-four defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. 

Van de Beek has also been capped ten times by the Dutch national team over the past three years, but has failed to find the net.
