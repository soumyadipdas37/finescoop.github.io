She's been making the most of lockdown travel restrictions easing by jetting off on a sun-soaked European summer tour. 

And Montana Brown sent temperatures soaring as she slipped into a plunging white swimsuit while enjoying a boat trip during her trip to Italy on Wednesday.

The Love Island 2017 star, 25, showcased her peachy posterior as she playfully posed for the camera, before launching herself into the sea.

The TV personality went make-up free and wore her dyed blonde hair slicked back in a loose ponytail.

In an Instagram video, Montana was seen facing her fear of jumping in the sea. 

Before making the dive, the swimsuit-clad reality star turned to her friends and asked if they were ready, with the beautiful scenery of the Italian sea as her backdrop.  

Montana captioned the post: 'Your gal jumped in the sea and as you can see, Emily is like a proud mum.'

Montana recently celebrated her 25th birthday in Greece and has been making the most of her freedom since lockdown ended.  

As well as jet-setting across Europe, the Love Island star has been feeling reflective as she recently took to her YouTube channel to post a candid video about her love life.

Reflecting on her split from model Elliott Reeder earlier this year, Montana insisted she is the happiest she has ever been after a 'life-changing' few months.

The TV personality also revealed she is single but has been dating many suitors since their break-up, after she was linked to Waltham Abbey FC footballer Charlie Edwards in June.

Montana said: 'I am officially single, but actually loving it. 

'Also the show must go on, I'm feeling pretty fresh, I mean I wasn't feeling fresh when it first happened, don't get me wrong, I was pretty down in the dumps.

'But I feel like everything happens for a reason, I've been really able to focus on myself and my personal growth, personal goals. 

'I've met some amazing people along the way, I think everything happens for a reason.'
