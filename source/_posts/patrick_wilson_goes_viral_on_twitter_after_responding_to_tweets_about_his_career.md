While Patrick Wilson doesn't have a movie coming out until next year, the actor found himself going viral on Twitter.

It all started when Twitter user Das Skooketh shared three photos of Wilson and said, 'the mf really said i’m gonna be in a million movies but absolutely refuse to be famous,' which garnered over 20K retweets and quote retweets and over 210K likes.

The 47-year-old Aquaman star responded with a quote retweet of his own, with other Wilson fans like Dane DeHaan and Richard Marx chimed in as well, with the former even going so far as to claim he owes his career to Wilson.

Wilson joked in response, 'From now on, every time I get a bad review, I will say “Please talk to Richard Marx.” (Thanks @richardmarx, you’re pretty fucking great, too).'

In between thanking his fans and friends, he also congratulated his hometown Tampa Bay Lightning NHL hockey team for advancing in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Wilson has worked quite consistently in big-budget fare and indie projects alike, in both leading and supporting roles, for nearly 20 years, though he doesn't have the A-list type of fame that some of his contemporaries do.

He transitioned easily to feature film, playing a variety of different roles such as soldier William Travis in 2004's The Alamo and a pedophile in the 2005 indie Hard Candy.
