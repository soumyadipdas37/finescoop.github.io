She plays the fierce warrior Antiope in Wonder Woman and its upcoming sequel, Wonder Woman 1984.

And Robin Wright paraded her toned, muscular physique while out for an afternoon dog walk on Monday in Los Angeles, California, accompanied by her husband of two years, Clement Giraudet. 

The Princess Bride star, 54, looked magnificent in a slinky dark tank top and Daisy Duke denim shorts, while her husband, 34, was in a white t-shirt and dark shorts.

Robin also wore a standard disposal blue face mask while out as required by California law, along with a straw sunhat. 

The Forrest Gump actress shielded her eyes from the sun with classic dark shades, and wore bright teal trainers for the outing.

Her athletic figure and toned limbs were on full display, fitting for the star known as one of Wonder Woman's mentors in the 2017 DC blockbuster.

At one point while talking to a passerby, he showed off his toned torso while shirtless.

Robin and Clement wed in 2018, after dating for somewhere around a year.
