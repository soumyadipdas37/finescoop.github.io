At the end of July, she revealed she'd 'given in' and signed up for the X-rated subscription service. 

And, on Tuesday, Lauren Goodger, 33, showcased her VERY peachy derrière in a white lace thong while lounging on her bed as she promoted her OnlyFans account on Instagram. 

The TOWIE star lay on her front whilst clad in the skimpy lingerie and looked over her shoulder for the smouldering shot, while directing fans to pay $50 a month for access to more for saucy content. 

Wow! On Tuesday, Lauren Goodger showcased her VERY peachy derrière in a white lace thong while lounging on her bed as she promoted her OnlyFans account on Instagram





In June, Lauren revealed she'd opened an account on X-rated subscription service OnlyFans, two years after floating the idea of signing up.

The former TOWIE star shared a snap of herself pouting as she posed for a close-up selfie, which she captioned: 'I’ve given in! To all my fans who want to see me on only fans the time is now... subscribe #dailycontent.' 

Back in February, Lauren was forced to deny claims that she had turned to porn after a popular site used her footage and claimed to be shooting with the star.

She appeared on the Twitter feed for the adult website Latest Clips, in a video where Lauren was shown holding her bare chest, alongside the caption: 'Finished doing [boy-girl] contents with Lauren Goodger, stay tuned.'

However, a representative for Lauren told MailOnline: 'This is an old video of Lauren on holiday which has been stolen. Lauren has no plans to do any porn and is disgusted that they use her name/image to promote their website.'

In the clip, Lauren could be seen holding on to her naked chest and filming her body from around her torso and down to her posterior.

While the explicit site claimed to be working with Lauren, she issued the staunch denial to the MailOnline and claimed her image was simply taken.

In 2018, Lauren promised her fans she was planning on joining OnlyFans, yet just days later she was forced to admit she did not know what she was signing up for, while writing for her column since-defunct magazine Now. 

After baffling her fans, the former TOWIE star said: 'I would never do porn. I am not judging anyone that does. But it's not something I would want to do. LOL.

'I just thought the fan who asked me about the 'just for the fans' on my IG, meant I would set up a page just for my fans. I didn't realise it was a bl**dy porn site.'

While a large number of patrons use the OnlyFans platform to share and view X-rated images, it is actually marketed as a space where content creators can further monetise their work behind a paywall.
