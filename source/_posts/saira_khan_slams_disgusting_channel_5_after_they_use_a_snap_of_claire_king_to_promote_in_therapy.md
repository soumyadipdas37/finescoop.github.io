Saira Khan furiously hit out at Channel 5 in an impassioned social media statement on Wednesday, after they accidentally used a snap of actress Claire King to promote her In Therapy special.

The Loose Women star, 50, took to Instagram to brand the mistake 'clumsy and offensive' in a lengthy post after the image of Claire was used alongside her episode on the channel's catch up service.

Channel 5 have since rectified the mistake and replaced the snap of Claire with one of Saira, and the presenter later shared the update before urging her fans to 'speak up.'

Furious: Saira Khan furiously hit out at Channel 5 in an impassioned statement on Wednesday, after they mistakenly used a snap of Claire King to promote her In Therapy special

Saira shared a screengrab of the catch-up listing that at first featured a snap of Claire, after her episode of In Therapy aired on Tuesday night. 

She wrote: 'This is absolutely disgusting and an offence. @channel5_tv you have put the incorrect photo against my name on your website highlighting my very deep and personal ''In Therapy'' show, which was shown last night on the Channel.

'This is clumsy and very embarrassing. Please correct this mistake immediately. You managed to get all the other celebrities names and faces aligned. The one woman of colour on the show and you ''f*ck it up''.'

Error: The star branded the mistake 'clumsy and offensive' in a lengthy post after the image of Claire (above) was used alongside her episode on the channel's catch up service 







Raging: Saira slammed the error in a lenghty social media post, adding she was 'disappointed' with the channel for the mistake

Saira then continued: 'I bring colour into this debate, because when you have seen and been a victim of blatant racism, discrimination and ignorance in the media industry based on the colour of your skin, THESE kind of mistakes do not sit lightly. They feed into your insecurities, your self worth, your confidence and self belief.

'This has happened to me so many times, I get called the wrong name, accidentally missed of, mixed up with other Asian celebrities because we look the same!

'Stop these ''accidental mistakes'' until you go through the continual embarrassment - you can never appreciate or understand my upset and disappointment.

'For those of you using my mention of ''colour'' stop looking to say I'm using RACE as a weapon! Try and understand why this mistake would anger someone who had repeatedly had to put up with these ''mistakes''.

'I know a friend of mine who is white- she experienced the same thing on a show and wondered if she was 'missed off' because of her age and whether she was still relevant or not.



Angry: Saira shared Channel 5's mix-up on her social media, as she demanded for the image to be changed

Grateful: Later she revealed the network had corrected the mistake and replaced the image with one of her, after her episode of In Therapy aired the previous evening

'So yes, when these mistakes occur repeatedly one starts to relate it to age, race, etc. It's a natural thing to do. A mistake is not a mistake if it keeps happening repeatedly to the same person. Very, very disappointed!'

Mere hours later Channel 5 rectified the mistake, with the mix-up stemming from the fact that Saira's episode of In Therapy was the sixth in the series, while Claire's was episode four.

Sharing a screengrab of the new listing, the former star of The Apprentice wrote: 'Thank you @channel5_tv. Much appreciated.  To all those who are afraid to speak up because others will never see your point of view -

'Speak up, Stand up, Be heard. Your values, feelings and opinions matter. Do not fear what other people think. There will always be people to shut you up, put you down and want to intimidate and ridicule you.

'They do not walk in your shoes. They have not lived your life, they have not shared your experiences. Be the change. Make it work for you. Make it happen.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Channel 5 for comment.

Strong: Saira later shared another post of the correction, as she urged her followers to speak up regarding any issues of injustice



Defiant: Saira has never shied away from sharing her views when it comes to hard-hitting issues

Saira has never shied away from sharing her views when it comes to hard-hitting issues, and in November 2019 posed for a nude photoshoot for a magazine, as she declared she no longer felt 'shame' over her body.

She admitted that she opted to do the naked photo shoot because some of the women in her community would have been killed for doing the same. 

Saira told the Loose Women panel on Tuesday: 'I will stand in my underwear and say, you can’t kill me for this reason. I will go out there and wear my bikini. 

'To live their life how they wish to and want to be different, it’s OK. There is no excuse to murder a woman on that basis.'

Confident: On Tuesday Saira spoke about her decision to pose for a nude photoshoot for a magazine, as she declared she no longer felt 'shame' over her body

'I think my family are frightened for me. I do have people looking out for me. When I did that OK magazine shoot, it was a political reason for doing it.

'I didn’t do it to say, oh look how sexy I am. Women in my community would be murdered for doing it. My family are frightened but I would say that I am going to carry on because women are important to me in my community.'

Saira revealed earlier this month that her own mother didn't speak to her for eight months after she took part in the shoot, because she felt she had brought 'shame' on the family.

The mother and daughter reconciled when her 12-year-old son intervened and explained to his grandmother that his mum was trying to help other women.
