A good foundation is a must.

To get the Little Fires Everywhere star's blonde locks looking healthy, the pro started by applying a healing oil through the hair and working it into her dampened ends generously.  

Any beauty junkie knows that the secret to a salon-quality blowout is an effective hair dryer.

Subtle: While curls are making a comeback, to create a soft Old Hollywood glam look for Reese on television's biggest night, the pro used the curve classic wave wand

Not a hair out of place: She finished by sculpting the style around the head to create the perfect face-framing shape with the ghd narrow dressing brush

Size does matter when it comes to brushes, according to Lona. 

To create Reese's subtle waves, Lona opted for a size 3 ghd natural bristle radial brush 'to shape and grip the hair to lay a good foundation as you blowdry.'

For a polished and flawless look that will last all night, she smoothed the hair using ghd's platinum+ styler.

A lifesaver for the girl on the go, the straightener heats up fast and is the answer to managing flyaways.

Not a tool we might all have in our arsenal but a good one to have on hand when fashioning an updo or ponytail to create a smooth silky finish.

For hold, Lona set the look with a shaping spray as she worked.
