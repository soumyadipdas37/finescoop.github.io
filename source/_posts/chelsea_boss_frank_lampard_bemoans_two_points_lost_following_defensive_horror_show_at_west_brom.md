Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has been left angered by his side's poor defensive showing in the pulsating 3-3 draw at West Brom.  

His new-look team were dismantled in the first half with the Premier League newcomers reaching the interval with a shock three-goal lead. Callum Robinson struck twice and Kyle Bartley inflicted further misery at the far post.

All three efforts were avoidable and Lampard, despite the last-gasp fightback to secure a point, has rued the manner in which the west London outfit squandered their hopes of securing a win.

Thiago Silva was guilty of an error and two mistakes from Marcos Alonso punished the visitors

Robinson was able to finish beyond Willy Caballero after just three minutes following Marcos Alonso's sloppy backwards header, and the West Brom frontman was wheeling away in celebration shortly after.

Thiago Silva, making his top flight debut and sporting the captain's armband, was guilty of failing to control a simple pass and allowed Robinson to race through and fire home.

The trio of costly mistakes was rounded off with Alonso failing to keep track of Bartley from a corner, leaving Lampard infuriated during his post-match media duties.

Full back Marcos Alonso endured a nightmare game and was hauled off after two costly errors

He told Sky Sports: 'It's two points lost. That's no disrespect to West Brom, but to come here and understand the game and know that transitions and mistakes are something they would jump on, as well as counter-attacks and set pieces.

'You can't legislate for pure mistakes, which they were today, and that gives you a really difficult game to get back into. We showed character and persistence, but we didn't need to if we had done things properly in the game.

'The first one, Marcos (Alonso) heads it into the middle of the pitch from a transition. The second one from Thiago is a mistake. He's been around long enough to know that and we'll give him that one in his first game. 

'Then Marcos loses his man for the third goal from the corner. You can do as many meetings as you want, but if you're going to make those mistakes you give yourself a mountain to climb.

Tammy Abraham (R) admitted Chelsea must cut out the errors after netting his late equaliser

‘There's a lot that we can keep getting better at. They're not team goals or things you can analyse again and again. They're just mistakes and they need to go.’

Mason Mount was able to hand Chelsea a glimmer of hope after hammering inside Sam Johnstone's near post on 55 minutes, and fellow homegrown talents Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham rounded off the resurgence.     

'We need to cut out the mistakes as a team so we don't concede,' Abraham told Sky Sports.

'We need to be strong together and keep encouraging one another.'
