Work commitments took a back seat on Wednesday as Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing With The Stars judge Bruno Tonioli stepped out for a shopping trip in Los Angeles. 

The Italian choreographer, 64, showed off his muscular physique in a black vest top during an appearance at the city's  Pavilions Market, where he picked up some groceries. 

He added to his relaxed look with a pair of grey sweat pants, while a pair of battered high-top trainers rounded things off.  

Here he comes: Work commitments took a back seat on Wednesday as Dancing With The Stars judge Bruno Tonioli stepped out for a shopping trip in Los Angeles

In accordance with current safety guidelines Bruno wore a protective face mask as he made his way out of the supermarket with a full shopping trolley.

The outspoken judge is currently in Los Angeles to fulfill his role on Dancing With The Stars, but is expected to be back in the United Kingdom later this year for the eighteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing. 

Bruno surprised fans after returning to American TV screens with a silver-grey hairstyle, the result of dying his hair during lockdown in southern California.

Speaking to The Sun shortly afterwards, he insisted the look had prompted numerous compliments, and joked that he is now the spitting image of Hollywood star George Clooney.

He said: 'Covid-19 has given me the opportunity to reinvent myself. I've been meaning to do this for years as I'm completely silver and dying it is so much hassle.

'I couldn't go to the hairdressers so I grew out the roots and I looked demented so then I shaved it off, grade one all over, which made me look even worse, like a murderer or a nasty guy off EastEnders.

Distanced: Due to travel restrictions the judge will make remote appearances from his Los Angeles home for the first Strictly Come Dancing results shows at the beginning of this series

'But now it's a little bit longer it looks nice and I'm keeping the grey. I feel liberated and I've had a lot of compliments. Myself and George Clooney are now practically twins.'

Due to Covid-19 travel restrictions, Bruno was initially worried he would not be able to take part in this year's series of Strictly, which he has filmed simultaneously with the US version Dancing With The Stars for the last 14 years.

BBC bosses have confirmed that the judge will make remote appearances from his home for the Sunday night results shows at the beginning of this series.

But fans need not fear as bosses vowed they hope to have Bruno back in the Hertfordshire studio towards the end of the series, alongside judges Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse and Shirley Ballas.
