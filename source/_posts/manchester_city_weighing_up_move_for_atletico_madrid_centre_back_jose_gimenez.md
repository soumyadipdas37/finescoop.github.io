Manchester City are considering a move for Atletico Madrid defender Jose Gimenez as Pep Guardiola looks to sign another centre back before the transfer window closes.

City have been heavily linked with Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly and are maintaining an interest in the 29-year-old Senegal international.

But Gimenez, 25, is also on the list of targets drawn up by City with Guardiola keen to add a right-footed centre-back after signing Nathan Ake from Bournemouth for £41m.

Reports in Spain on Monday claimed that City have had a £87million bid rejected by Atletico.

However, it's understood the Premier League have not made an offer for Gimenez or Koulibaly, and would not be prepared to pay that much for 25-year-old Uruguayan let alone the £110m buyout clause in his contract.

They will continue to pursue a number of options before the window closes on October 5 and are confident of adding to the signings of Ake and Valencia winger Ferran Torres for £20.8m.
