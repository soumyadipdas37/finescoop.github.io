Kyly Clarke split from her husband Michael earlier this year.  

But on Thursday, the 39-year-old WAG proved she's in the best shape of her life while soaking up the Sydney sun. 

Taking to Instagram, Kyly sizzled as she slipped into a skimpy black and white bikini  while soaking up in the sun.

Turning up the heat! Kyly Clarke soaked up some Vitamin D as she flaunted her taut bikini body in a Sydney park on Thursday 

The House Rules judge's flat stomach and long, shapely pins were on full display as she laid outstretched on a towel. 

She finished her look with a pair of circular sunglasses and a pink and white Billabong trucker hat. 

'Sydney you are teasing us!!! A little Vitamin D and a lot of sunscreen,' she wrote.   

Kyly's post comes after her ex-husband Michael Clarke reflected on his life, a year after separating from his wife.

In a rare interview for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine, the retired Australian cricketer said that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'. 

'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said. 

Michael, who co-parents four-year-old daughter Kelsey Lee with Kyly, went on to reveal that he has been able to maintain a 'wonderful' friendship with his ex-wife.

In July, Michael confirmed his relationship with P.E Nation co-founder Pip Edwards, when they were spotted enjoying a romantic vacation in Noosa, Queensland. 

Hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip, 40, the radio host did say that he couldn't be happier.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said.
