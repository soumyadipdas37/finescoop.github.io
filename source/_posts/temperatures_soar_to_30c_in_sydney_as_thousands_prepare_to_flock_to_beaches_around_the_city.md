Sydneysiders are flocking to the beach as temperatures soar - but are warned to brace for smoke as authorities conduct hazard reduction burns.

The mercury will hit 30C in most suburbs on Thursday, before a southerly change blows the first real taste of summer away.

Weatherzone meterologist Brett Dutschke said the warm weather is 'not unusual' for this time of year, despite being well above the September average.  

'In spring we always get a taste of summer but it's usually brief,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'But having said that, the city's 30C forecast is about 10C above average for this time of the year.

The harbour city will hit 30C in most suburbs on Thursday, before a southerly change blows the taste of summer away

'In the western suburbs its about 7C above average for this time of year.'

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the average maximum temperature for September - recorded at Observatory Hill in Sydney's CBD - is 20.1C.  

Mr Dutschke said the 30C forecast was widespread across the city but the beaches would linger around the 26C, 27C mark. 

He explained the heat has been pulled to the east coast from the interior.  

'Today we've got winds blowing from the north-west and it's drawing some heat from the interior where it has been building for the past few days,' he said.  

'With north-westerly winds, it's drawing that heat closer to the east coast.'

But the summer-like conditions are expected to come to a 'rapid end' with a southerly wind change in the late afternoon. 

Mr Dutschke said temperatures should drop 'by about 10C in an hour or two'.

'By the time we get to 6pm, most of Sydney will be colder than 20C, cloudy and later this evening, showers are possible,' he said. 

The southerly change will bring 'strong' winds of about 30 to 40km/h on the coast. 

'Strong warning for coastal waters in relation to that southerly change and also on the harbour. It will get quite bumpy as well,' Mr Dutschke said. 

The winds will ease by Friday and will turn more south-easterly and north-easterly. 

There will be increased humidity over the weekend and a chance of showers across the city.  

'Just about everywhere in Sydney is the chance of a shower during Friday and Saturday,' Mr Dutschke said.

NSW Rural Fire Service released a smoke warning on Thursday as they conduct 'controlled hazard reduction burning in a number of areas across NSW over coming days'.

'Smoke from these planned burns may settle in a number of areas in particular parts of the Greater Sydney, Illawarra, Central Coast, Armidale, Inverell, Liverpool Plains and Mid Coast areas,' they said.  

NSW RFS warned smoked from bush fires and hazard reduction burning can affect some people more than others.

Children, older adults and people with heart and lung conditions are most susceptible to air pollution and excessive smoke. 

'If you have asthma or a lung condition, reduce outdoor activities if smoke levels are high and if shortness of breath or coughing develops, take your reliever medicine or seek medical advice,' NSW RFS said.
