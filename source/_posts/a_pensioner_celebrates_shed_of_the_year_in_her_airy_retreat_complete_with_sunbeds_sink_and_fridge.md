A retired party planner is celebrating after her summerhouse triumphed in the Cuprinol Shed Of The Year 2020 awards.

Jane Moyle, 77, uses the bright and airy space in her back garden to entertain friends and her 11 grandchildren.

It's a subject the pensioner from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, knows plenty about after a successful career as an organiser of VIP corporate events.

Jane (pictured) took inspiration from Japan in creating her ultimate summerhouse. What started as somewhere to store photo albums soon blossomed into a space for entertaining her friends and 11 grandchildren

'In my career I used to put on events for some of the biggest companies in the world, so that came in handy when designing the summerhouse,' she said.

'I initially conceived it as a lovely restful place that my husband and I could relax in, and somewhere where I could display some of the photographs I love to take.

'With the folding doors and the decking outside, it is ideal for outdoor meals, sunbathing and reading.

'But now it gets just as much use from my grandkids who range in age from 11 to 28. They have a lot of fun in there when granny isn't around.

'We live in the centre of Cheltenham but when you're in the summerhouse it feels like you're in the country.'

Jane triumphed in the 'Summerhouse' category of the competition after she decided to renovate the shed.    

The summerhouse has been designed to the highest spec complete with sunbeds, sink, fridge for garden parties, books, and ample space to store sports equipment

It was originally built as a Japanese summer house but was never finished off by the previous owners.

Determined to pick up from where they left off and complete the job, creative Jane lovingly restored it into a luxury summerhouse, complete with sunbeds, sink, fridge for garden parties. 

The grandmother originally wanted to create the space to store her treasured lifetime of photographs which she now intends on putting into order. 

Judges have been blown away by the imagination and creativity on display from sheds up and down the country during these unprecedented times but it was Jane's shed that impressed them

Croquet sets, badminton nets, boules, are also stored in the summerhouse ready to play with as soon as the urge arises. 

The space is a haven of peace and tranquillity, which considering it is in the middle of a large town is often wondered at by Jane's friends.

Head Judge and competition founder Andrew Wilcox said: 'This year we've been blown away by the imagination and creativity on display from sheddies up and down the country, during these unprecedented times.

'Jane's stylish summerhouse impressed us with its sophisticated design and the fact that it brings so much joy to so many generations.'

The sophisticated design of the shed appeals to multi-generations and creates a little countryside sanctuary in the centre of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

Kirsty Woodbine, Marketing Manager for Cuprinol, said: 'The extraordinary events of this past year have seen the nation's sheds take on a host of new roles in our lives - from a family refuge to a sheducation hub.

'It highlights how creative and considerate we can be even through the most difficult of times.

'Now more than ever our gardens, patios and outside spaces provide welcome respite from the uncertainties of the world outside - allowing us time to reflect, relax and socialise.

The public voted for their favourite shed through readerssheds.co.uk who were mesmerised by the grandmother's imagination and creativity

'At Cuprinol we're committed to helping people make the most of the outdoors so they can enjoy all the benefits getting closer to nature brings.'

This year's entrants competed across nine categories - with two new lockdown-specific categories introduced - Lockdown Repurpose and Lockdown New-build. 

A public vote through readerssheds.co.uk decided each winner.
