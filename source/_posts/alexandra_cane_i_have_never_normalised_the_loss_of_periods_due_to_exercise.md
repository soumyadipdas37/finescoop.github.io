Love Island star Alexandra Cane broke down on Instagram on Friday and declared she is taking a break from the site after being attacked by trolls. 

Talking about exercise, Alexandra, 29, who has lost two stone, said that sometimes periods can stop, but was upset when some thought her words were irresponsible.  

Alexandra said that keyboard warriors should consider her mental health as she said: 'I have never normalised the loss of periods due to exercise'.

'I have never normalised the loss of periods due to exercise': Alexandra Cane broke down in tears and said she's taking time out from Instagram on Friday after trolls attack her online 

She said: 'Receiving a tirade of abuse from people regarding certain topics. My words being twisted and misconstrued yet again when people only see glimpses of my life. Not the full picture. 

'You have no idea what's going on behind closed doors, but people are so quick to try and tear you down. 

'I will continue to better myself and provide a voice for people who are struggling with things that are classes as "taboo" subjects. 

'I would rather open up a conversation than let people suffer in silence. People want me to address things but when I do I'm told I shouldn't because I'm not a professional. Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

'Always show people kindness regardless of how they treat you.' 

She continued: 'Sadly the internet is a breeding ground for people trying to tear others down. I'm not here for it. I'm taking myself off social media for a few days to sit and reflect and think of ways I can move forward in a positive way to continue helping and bettering others.' 

Then breaking down in tears, she shared a video further explaining her emotions. 

She said: [I need to disappear off social media] for my own mental sake. It's funny how you click on the people's profiles who are bashing you and they're the first people to be posting about mental health and not tearing other people down because you don't know what battles they are facing behind closed doors.

'Well it's funny now the shoe's on the other foot. My intentions have never been to hurt anybody or cause anyone any distress or pain or any problems. 

'My fitness plan, I launched was all done with a professional and very credible nutritionist. I never recommended anything other than what the government guidelines state, so for anyone who is bashing me, please remember that.

'I have never normalised anything to do with loss of periods due to exercise, etc, I merely said it's something that can happen within the industry and not enough people speak about it. So I wish to share my experience at some point in the future and my reasons why certain things have happened to me.

'There are other factors that have come into play regarding this which I don't wish to speak on.'

She concluded: 'I'm going to take myself off to spend some good quality time with the people that I love and adore that need me more than this situation does. I need to channel my energy into something positive rather than feeding into the negative.
