Matthew David Hughes, 27, was arrested in April for breaking into Eminem's mansion

The man arrested in April for breaking into Eminem's mansion outside Detroit stood over the rapper's bed and threatened to kill him, a court has heard.

Matthew David Hughes, 27, appeared in Macomb County District Court on Wednesday, facing charges of first-degree home invasion and malicious destruction of property.

Officer Adam Hackstock testified that Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, awoke to find someone standing over his bed.

'When Mr. Mathers asked him why he was there, he was told by Mr. Hughes that he was there to kill him,' Hackstock said on the stand, according to the Detroit Free Press. 

Hackstock said that Eminem told him he escorted Hughes out of the house through a TV area, game room and basketball court to an exit out of the house.

When the officer arrived on the scene, he found Hughes wrestling with a security guard outside the mansion, Hackstock said.

An investigation revealed that one of the home's windows had been smashed out with a brick, the officer said.

Clinton Township Detective Dan Quinn testified that multiple angles of security footage showed Hughes on the premises for 'quite some time' before he climbed through the busted window. 

Eminem is well-known for his 2000 track 'Stan' which tells the story of an over zealous fan who becomes a stalker, named Stanley 'Stan' Mitchell. 

The influential song is where the term 'stan culture' comes from, describing dedicated fans of famous stars, who refer to themselves as 'stans.' 

The song is a cautionary tale to fans about taking everything your idol says literally.

In the lyrics, Eminem reveals how the character Stan starts writing him several letters, over three verses, where he becomes more obsessive and angrier when he doesn't get a reply from the star. 

After Hughes was arrested on April 6, it emerged that he was arrested in June 2019 for trespassing on two Michigan properties, one of them a former home of Eminem.

Hughes is reportedly homeless, and his court-appointed attorney had sought a competency hearing for him, which Hughes declined. 

Hughes is being held on a $50,000 cash bond. On Wednesday, the judge denied a request by Hughes’ attorney to reduce the bond.

At the hearing, Judge Jacob Femminineo Jr found there is probable cause to move forward with a trial, and scheduled a September 28 arraignment in Macomb County Circuit Court.
