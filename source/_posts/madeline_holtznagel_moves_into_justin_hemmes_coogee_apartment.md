The publication understands Justin purchased the three-bedroom property six years ago for $2.1million.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Justin Hemmes for comment.

With her stunning features and her sizzling Instagram feed, it's no wonder Justin took a liking to Madeline - who is the younger sister of Australia's Next Top Model finalist Simone Holtznagel.

Madeline was one of the four models who was permitted by Justin to self-isolate during the COVID-19 pandemic at his $60million mansion in Sydney's Vaucluse. 

The businessman himself stayed in the country at another of his properties with his two young daughters, Alexa, four, and Saachi, three. 

Justin shares his two children with his ex-partner Kate Fowler, 29, who he announced he had split from in July 2018.

Kate is the older sister of Victoria's Secret supermodel Georgia Fowler.  

The Merivale boss told The Sydney Morning Herald at the time: 'Kate and I have the utmost love and respect for each other.

'At the beginning of 2018, Kate and I decided our friendship and respect for family life would become the focus of our relationship,' he continued.  

'We love our children dearly and for now, continue to live together happily in our family home.

'Kate is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful woman. As for what the future holds, I am not sure.'

In August 2018, it was claimed Justin was dating a then-single Australia's Next Top Model star Montana Cox.

The brunette beauty denied the reports, telling The Sydney Morning Herald that they are 'just friends'.
