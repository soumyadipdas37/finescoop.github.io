She's the beauty who won the heart of Matt Agnew on last year's season of The Bachelor. 

And on Thursday, Chelsie McLeod revealed the exact workout behind her sensational physique - and it only takes 30 minutes.

The 28-year-old chemical engineer shared an image of her exercise plan to her Instagram Stories.

The hardcore workout shows that Chelsie favours high-intensity interval training.

Chelsie's routine includes skipping for 100 jumps, before running two laps of her driveway, and then completing a series of gruelling bodyweight exercises, including burpees, mountain climbers, bench jumps and high knees.

Chelsie revealed she runs through the high energy workout three times.

Meanwhile, Chelsea and Matt split last year shortly after she won his heart on The Bachelor.

Last month, she took a massive swipe at her ex while watching the new season of the show.

The blonde stunner said Locky Gilbert was more her type in a video she filmed with her male pal.   

Chelsie agreed she went on the wrong season of the reality show, and claimed she she was more of 'an adventurer' like Lachie rather than a 'science nerd'. 

'I think he (Locky) is more my type in that he is more adventurous and fun,' she quipped.

Matt and Chelsie unexpectedly announced their break-p in November last year, just six weeks after The Bachelor finale had aired on TV.

They each released statements on Instagram, with Matt describing Chelsie as a 'very special woman' who 'deserves to find happiness'.

He clarified that there was no third party involved in the split.
