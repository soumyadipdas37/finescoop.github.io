Whether you want to beat the autumn chill or warm up the bed, reviewers are calling the Cosi Home Premium Comfort Electric Blanket the 'best electric blanket ever' and 'a must for cold nights!'

Starting at just £21.99 (now 45 per cent off), Cosi Home's electric blanket is an affordable way to keep warm at night.

Suitable for adults and children alike, it features three temperature levels so you can control how warm you want to be at any given time, a detachable cord for easy washing, and 'overheat protection' for peace of mind.

Now 45 per cent off, the Cosi Home Premium Comfort Electric Blanket is the 'best electric blanket ever' and 'a must for cold nights!' according to Amazon shoppers

Shoppers love this electric blanket so much, 73 per cent have given it a five-star rating and with over 3,000 praise-filled reviews, it's earned the number one spot in Amazon's Heating Pads category.

'The best electric blanket I've ever had!' one enthusiastic shopper said. 'Fabulous blanket. It's lovely and cosy. We have had many over the years, and this is definitely the best one'.

'Why didn't someone tell me about electric blankets sooner?' wrote another. 'Best thing I've ever bought in my life.'

Another electric blanket convert wrote: 'I bought this on the strength of the reviews, and so far it seems to be perfect. I have a double bed, but bought the king-size blanket which ensures no mast cold spots!

'I put it on high rough 90 mins before I go to bed, and the bed is gloriously warm when I climb in. I leave it on the low setting overnight, and it keeps me comfortably warm all night.'

Available in sizes from single to king the soft and durable electric blanket from Cosi Home is relatively thin so that you won't feel it between your mattress and bottom bed sheet

As well as keeping you cosy, electric blankets are known to help with achy muscles and even stiffness and pain from arthritis, as a customer wrote: 'Bought as a Xmas gift for my mum who lives with M.E. and fibro chronic pain as well as some arthritis. 

'She says it's a game-changer, so much better than hot water bottles, helps her sleep through the night and get through flare-ups. Buying one for myself next!'

Available in sizes from single to king, the soft and durable electric blanket from Cosi Home is relatively thin so that you won't feel it between your mattress and bottom bed sheet. And thanks to its integrated corner ties it won't sleep and slide around as you slumber.

For extra comfort and additional warmth, we recommend combining this electric blanket with a high tog duvet. You might even find you'll be able to switch off your central heating overnight. Win-win.
