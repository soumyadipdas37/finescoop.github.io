A murderer has been caught fighting with his victim in CCTV footage just minutes before stabbing him to death.   

Jordan Brown, 25, of Barry, Wales, was found guilty of murdering Jordan Davies, 23, at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday following a three-week trial.

The jury took just over two hours to return a guilty verdict on a single count of murder. Brown was remanded in custody to appear at the same court on Friday for sentencing.

During the trial CCTV footage was shown as part of the evidence which caught the moment that Brown stabbed his victim on December 16 last year.

The footage shows the initial confrontation between Brown and Mr Davies in Barry while a mutual friend watches on.

Brown is then shown running from the town centre back to his flat in Holton Road to retrieve a flick knife before he is seen walking back to the town centre to go after Mr Davies again. 

He is then seen throwing what appear to be punches but are in fact stabs in the direction of Mr Davies' body.

The final frames show Brown, having changed his clothes, walking from his flat before discarding his clothes in an alleyway off Digby Street.

Following the verdict senior investigating officer detective inspector Matt Powell said: 'Today concludes a South Wales Police major crime investigation into the murder of Jordan Davies which took place in Holton Road, Barry.

'Following a confrontation in the street with his then-friend Jordan Brown he was stabbed three times with one fatal wound to his chest.

'Mr Davies collapsed and Brown fled from the scene, discarding his clothes in a nearby lane.

'Despite the best efforts of members of the public and extensive medical treatment by medical professionals who attended the scene Mr Davies sadly did not survive.

'Jordan Davies' family have shown tremendous courage and dignity. They have waited patiently due to delays brought about by the current pandemic to see justice delivered.

'We hope the outcome at Cardiff Crown Court today can go some way in helping them to recover from this tragedy.

'This tragic case yet again highlights the devastating and far-reaching consequences of knife crime.

'I cannot stress enough the importance of loved ones reporting their concerns if they suspect someone they know is carrying a knife or involved in knife crime.

'Speaking out could, quite simply, save a life.'
