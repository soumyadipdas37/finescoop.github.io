Releasing the line is something of a dream come true for Devon, who has wanted to launch a collection ever since getting started in modelling. 

'Since I began in the modelling industry, my end goal was to always build my brand and start my own line!' she told Forbes. 

'It wasn't until years later that I realised my love for resort wear, and at the same time noticed a gap in the market for swim that has more design detail and that is more elevated than just your average triangle bikini.'

She added: 'I'm also not limiting myself at just swim — sooner than later, I will be offering some affordable RTW!'
