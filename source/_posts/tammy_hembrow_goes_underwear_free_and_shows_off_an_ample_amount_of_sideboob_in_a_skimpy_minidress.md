Tammy Hembrow is certainly not shy when it comes to showing off her sensational curves.

And on Friday, the blonde bombshell dared to step out in a skimpy thigh-split minidress for a night out on Queensland's Gold Coast with her sisters and some friends.

The 26-year-old social media sensation appeared to be underwear free and flashed an ample amount of sideboob in her racy pink outfit.

Her halterneck dress was backless, featured a plunging neckline and cinched in her waist.

The mother-of-two shared a video of herself modelling the outfit in her bathroom before heading out, showing her adjusting the frock and flaunting her figure. 

For makeup, Tammy went all out with a glamorous look complete with a pale pink pout, bold winged eyeliner and false eyelashes.

Tammy has previously said that she likes to workout at least three times a week to maintain her incredible physique.

During an appearance on Studio 10 back in December, Tammy described the strenuous workout regimen that helps her achieve her famous derriere.

'I do a lot of heavy weights. You're not going to build any muscle if you are not doing leg weights. I see a lot of girls doing cardio and this and that, it is not going to build any muscle really,' she said.

When asked how heavy she goes with her weighted squats, the blonde shocked the panel by saying she could easily perform 60kg.

Last year, Tammy addressed speculation she has had Brazilian butt lift surgery and insisted her famously pert derrière was the result of working out in the gym.

She told The Daily Telegraph: 'I have always had people say that, they just don't know that you can achieve that with working out.'

'Obviously it is genetics and you can't change your features but you can build muscle and shape and tone and all of that. I get tired of being accused of that.

As for her diet secrets, she also revealed that she eats every two hours and sticks to a 'really' clean, protein-rich diet for her growing glutes.

The social media sensation's night out on the town comes after she recently returned from a romantic getaway with her new beau, Ironman Matt Poole, 32.

Last week the couple, along with a group of friends, jetted off to the Whitsundays.

While Tammy has yet to officially share a photo of him on her Instagram, the hunky triathlete debuted their relationship on his social media posting a photo of them cosied up together on a yacht during the tropical holiday.
