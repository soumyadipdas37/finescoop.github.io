Jourdan Dunn has shared her concerns for her son Riley's future in an emotional letter following 'cases of injustice and brutality against black people'.

The model, 30, admitted that her son's innocence has been 'shaken' and she feels helpless trying to comfort him while she also feels 'afraid' following recent events. 

In the letter, which was penned for the November issue of Harper's Bazaar, she encouraged her son to be a 'joyful black boy', in a world determined to paint him differently.

An extract from the letter, read: 'My love for you runs so deep. It's my mission to instil you with the greatest examples of affection, nurture and care. 

'But I worry that this world will break your kind and loving spirit. Your innocence has been shaken by the recent cases of injustice and brutality against black people.

'At times, I've felt helpless finding the right way to comfort you while I myself am in pain – afraid, hurt and angry. Like me, occasionally you will lose faith in humanity, but it will be restored again and again.

'You owe people nothing – but you do owe it to yourself to be happy and carefree and set this world on fire. Be a joyful black boy in a society that wants to portray you in a different light.

'Some will want to label you because of misperceptions based on racial hate and pettiness, but only you can own your narrative, only you can create your own story. 

'Your future is so bright, I'm excited to witness it. It's all yours for the taking, Ry... You're Black history in the making.'

Jourdan was encouraged to draw inspiration from Maya Angelou's essay collection Letter To My Daughter and write missives to their children.

Jourdan gave birth to Riley in 2010 when she was 19-years-old and returned to the modelling nine-months later, while she has continued to manage motherhood and her career ever since.

Jourdan celebrated turning 30 on Monday 3 August and was brought out a personalised cake with pictures of her fondest memories.

Despite the ongoing pandemic, the British beauty has had a year of celebrations following her engagement announcement to her partner Dion Hamilton in February.

Jourdan has kept information about her other half secret, but hinted last month that they started dating in 2019 when she shared a picture of him during their holiday in Jamaica.

The model's post in January sparked speculation that she had already married Dion, as she shared the holiday post of themselves alongside her beloved son Riley, nine.

The accompanying caption was rather telling. She wrote: '2009 my son entered my life, 2019 my life partner entered my life. Stepping into 2020 with both by my side is priceless.'

While she pixelated her man's face, the trio had all co-ordinated their outfits for the occasion.
