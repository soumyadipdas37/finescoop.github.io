Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B modeled a corseted mini-dress that was 'all white and pearly' after announcing she's divorcing her husband Offset days before what would've been their third wedding anniversary.

The Bronx-born 27-year-old just defended herself after outrage over her creating an Instagram account for their two-year-old daughter Kulture Kiari Cephus, which currently has 723K followers.

'For everybody that is so bothered that I made a page for my daughter, I decided I was going to make a page for my daughter because she has a lot of new business ventures,' Cardi (born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar) said Saturday via Twitter.

'And I just felt like, since it's kids stuff, I'm just going to make a page for my daughter, because it's going to be her business, her stuff, and she's going to be the boss. 

'I understand why people say, "Oh it's kind of weird because she's two years old." Well, my two-year-old and your two-year-old [are] different, you know what I'm saying? Stop staying stuff. She's well protected. I always protect my kid, and I don't want her page being [covered] with negativity. 

'Like I said, she's a happy baby. It's supposed to be a happy page and soon her business ventures are going to launch. All of you guys enjoy it and stop with the weird stuff please. I know how to be a mom. If I'm not good at nothing else, I'm good at being a mother. Trust.'

Last Tuesday, the Joe Biden supporter requested joint legal and physical custody of little Kulture with the 28-year-old Migos rapper (born Kiari Kendrell Cephus), who has three children from prior relationships.

Cardi revealed on Instagram Live last Friday that she has 'shed not one tear' over the divorce, which she filed after getting 'tired of f***ing arguing.'

The Hustlers actress - who boasts 130.7M social media followers - said: 'It's not because the cheating. I'm seeing people [saying], "Oh, he has a baby on the way." That's a whole f***ing complete lie."'

In happier news, Cardi's hit song WAP - short for Wet-A** P***y - featuring Megan Thee Stallion just spent a fourth consecutive week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart.
