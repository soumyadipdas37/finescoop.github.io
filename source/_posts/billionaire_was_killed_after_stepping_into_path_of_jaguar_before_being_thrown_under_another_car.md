A Russian tycoon was killed when he mysteriously walked into the path of a Jaguar before being thrown under another car, a coroner heard. 

Dmitry Obretetskiy was walking his dog Oscar when he was knocked down near his home in leafy Oxshott, Surrey.  

It was unclear why the successful 39-year-old crossed the road in front of a car, but it was thought he was trying to regain control of his dog or misjudged the timings, a court heard. 

The father-of-three was thrown off the bonnet of a luxury Jaguar and into the path of an unsuspecting BMW travelling in the opposite direction.

Emergency services scrambled to the scene at 6pm and found Mr Obretetskiy lying with 'reduced consciousness and a bleeding scalp' before flying him to hospital on November 25 last year. 

A forensic collision investigator later discovered that the overseas business owner would have seen the headlights of the Jaguar for 11 seconds before the crash.  

Detective Constable David Bloomfield (Corr) said: 'The Jaguar was travelling at 35mph in a 40mph zone. 

'Dmitry would have been able to see the lights of the Jaguar 11 seconds before it collided with him. 

'There were no vehicle defects and no evidence of third party involvement.

'It is not known why he moved in front of the Jaguar. It is possible that Dmitry had started to crossed to the middle of the road when no one was coming and was waiting for a gap in the traffic but mistimed it. 

'It is also possible his dog ran into the road and he was trying to regain control of him.'  

The mother of his children, Uliana Mishina rushed the St George's Hospital, Tooting, London, and identified the tycoon following the crash. 

She said: 'We were never married, we had been in a relationship since 1997 and we had three children during our time together.'

After five days in hospital, the billionaire's long-term partner and three children were told about his poor prognosis before he died just after 8pm on November 30 last year. 

Dr Jonathan Aron, an intensive care coordinator, confirmed how during his time in the hospital, Mr Obretetskiy remained deeply comatose after fracturing his skull, ribs and parts of his spine. 

He added: 'The family explained that Dmitry would have wanted to have become an organ donor but despite this, he rapidly passed away.' 

Mr Obretetskiy was reported to have founded a household chemicals retail company and was owner of Magnat Trade Enterprise - official distributor for Mars, Nestle, and Procter & Gamble in Russia - making him billions. 

Mr Obretetskiy's son Ilya, understood to be aged 22 years, attended Millfield School and he also had two daughters at school in England. 

The assistant coroner for Surrey, Dr Karen Henderson concluded that Dmitry Obretetsky had died in a road traffic collision after suffering a traumatic brain injury and polytrauma.

Sitting in Woking Coroners Court, she said: 'For reasons that remain unclear, Dmitry crossed the road on November 25 2019 and was in a position to have been hit by a car and projected into the path of another car suffering injuries which were not survivable.'

The forensic collision investigator added: 'At approximately 4.40pm, a driver of a jaguar was driving northbound on the A24 on Warren Lane. At the same time, two further drivers of a BMW and a Tesla were travelling southbound.

Reports from Obretetsky's home city of Volgograd reveal he has been in business with a Dmitry Tozik, who is currently behind bars in Russia after being extradited from Belarus last year

'Dmitry was crossing Warren Lane with his dog on the entrance to the free car park entrance in Oxshott. He has collided with the front of off side of the jaguar and he was projected into the south bound lane and into the path of the BMW.'  

The Russian businessman lived in Hamilton House, a £6 million property on an exclusive estate in Oxshott. Former England and Chelsea captain John Terry also owns a property nearby.

Reports from Obretetsky's home city of Volgograd reveal he has been in business with a Dmitry Tozik. 

Tozik is currently behind bars in Russia after being extradited from Belarus last year over claims he conned his workers out of 26million roubles (£300,000).

Obretetsky and Dmitry Tozik, 44, set up company Evraz-Building in 2008 with another shareholder called Alexander Nabatchikov. 

He is charged with non-payment of 26 million roubles (£310,000) of wages to 600 workers and the deliberate bankruptcy of another company, Plant of Reinforced Concrete Products and Structures. 

However it is not clear that Obretetsky was party to this dispute which involved a different company to the one he shared with Tozik.
