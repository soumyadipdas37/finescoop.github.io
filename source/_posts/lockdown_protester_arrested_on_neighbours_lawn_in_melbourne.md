A lockdown protester yelled 'how dare you do this to Aussies' as he was arrested for partying in his neighbour's front yard in Melbourne.

Marty Focker was hanging out at the house next door to his suburban home on Sunday afternoon, playing with his friend's children and neighbourhood kids.

His neighbour set up a DJ table and was blasting tunes, billowing smoke from a machine, and helping his toddler fire tennis balls to children on the road.

But the merriment quickly attracted the attention of two police officers who confronted Mr Focker about breaching Melbourne's tough Stage Four lockdown.

Mr Focker admitted he didn't live there and was from next door, prompting police to ask him to verify with his name or ID.

He gave police his first name but when asked for his last name said: 'But I haven't committed an offence'.

But the police, already exasperated with increasing numbers of lockdown-dodgers who refuse to cooperate, were in no mood to argue.

'This is how it's going to go, Marty, unless you provide some sort of identification or state your name and we can confirm it, you will be arrested. Do you understand that?' one said.

The officers then advanced to arrest Mr Focker, brushing off the owner's demand that they not enter his property.

'Seriously you guys are the worst, how dare you do this to Aussies,' Mr Focker said as he was handcuffed and taken away.

Mr Focker was later released after police were able to verify his identity, and he vented his frustration on social media.

'I was arrested for this huge offence of being in a friends front yard as he was playing some music by the Victorian fun police,' he wrote.

'No offence was ever actually given to me beyond failing to give my name. There was no offence committed which is why I didn't want to give my name or ID. 

'The police did then trespass onto my friends property (claiming they are allowed to under the health officer?) to arrest me in order to get my name and ID by force.'

Mr Focker had indeed committed an offence by breaking lockdown to visit his neighbour as Melburnians are not allowed to leave their homes for social reasons.

He said police told him he would likely receive a fine in the mail for his breach of lockdown.

On his social media, Mr Focker routinely calls coronavirus a 'plandemic', Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews a 'dictator', and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern an 'evil 'b***h'. 

'People aren't allowed to do anything, how long will you be hiding from the flu?' he wrote in one post.

'I think all these unjust breaches of basic rights along with fines/arrests that aren't following their own acts properly will be dismissed before court.' 

He has made numerous posts in support of anti-lockdown protests, including a scheduled September 5 demonstration police are trying to shut down.

Such protests on the weekend resulted in dozens of people wearing tracksuits and Guy Fawkes masks clashing with police in Broadmeadows.

Confronting footage showed the protesters making their way through the streets as traffic was brought to a standstill.

The protesters claimed, when asked, that they were simply getting their daily exercise, which is one of just four legal reasons to leave home in Melbourne.

After a brief confrontation they turned tail and fled from increasing police numbers, knocking down fences in the scramble to escape.

At least six people were arrested during the protests, but police have not ruled out issuing further infringement notices.

Victoria has finally got its daily new case numbers under 100, down from a high of more than 700, but still has two more weeks of Stage Four lockdown.
