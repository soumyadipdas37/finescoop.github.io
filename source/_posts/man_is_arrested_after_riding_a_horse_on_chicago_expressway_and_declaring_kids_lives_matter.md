A man who calls himself the 'Dread Head Cowboy' was arrested Monday after riding his horse on Chicago's Dan Ryan Expressway during rush hour.

Adam Hollingsworth, 33, was escorted by a group of motorcyclists as he rode southbound lanes of the expressway, sometimes at a gallop, for several miles. 

On a Facebook Live feed while he was riding, Hollingsworth said he wanted everyone to know kids lives matter. 'Until kids' lives matter, nothing else matters,' he said. The #KidsLivesMatter movement aims to raise awareness of the US census, CNN reports, and funding for children's programs. 

Hollingsworth's ride resulted in extensive delays on the expressway, with traffic backed up for miles.

Hollingsworth has been making appearances in various Chicago neighborhoods to promote participation in the U.S. census, teaming up with Mayor Lori Lightfoot. 

In a statement her office told The Chicago Sun Times: 'What is clear is that this stunt not only seriously endangered the horse, but also the rider and all travelers on the expressway.

'There is a right way and a wrong way to call attention to issues of great importance and this stunt was decidedly the very wrong way.' 

But activist Mark Carter said: 'We need the resources in our communities. Our children are dying our communities are dying. When will she listen. When will the governor listen.'
