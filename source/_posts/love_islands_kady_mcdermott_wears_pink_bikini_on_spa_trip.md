She's no stranger to turning heads, both on-camera and at high-profile events.

And Kady McDermott looked typically stunning as she shared a photo from a recent spa trip to Instagram on Tuesday.

The Love Island star, 25, was the picture of confidence as she slipped into a tiny pink bikini while enjoying a hot tub session.

Showcasing her incredible figure, the media personality stunned in the two-piece, which featured a halterneck bralet and matching briefs.

The make-up artist ensured focus remained on her striking frame as she accessorised with dainty earrings.

With her tresses scraped into a ponytail, Kady displayed her naturally radiant complexion as she went make-up free.

Kady recently left fans confused after she announced she is still with boyfriend Myles Barnett and they will live in their new home 'as a couple', weeks after confirming yet another 'break-up'.

The brunette previously took to social media to confirm she will be living in her renovated bungalow with former TOWIE star Myles, 26, when it is finished.

The duo bought a Hertfordshire property together in April 2019 with plans to completely transform it into a two-storey house.

The brunette blamed their split on the pressure of the build which caused them to argue, as she joked that their renovation has been more stressful than having a baby.  

She wrote: 'Just to stop all the personal dms because we are literally get one every single minute, which is understandable.

'Me and Myles are will both be living in this house as a couple, couples do argue. It is a very exciting time for us both but also ridiculously stressful.

'Me and Myles can't wait to live in our forever home and will continue to share our journey with you.'

'Now I understand when people say renovating/moving home is more stressful than having a baby.' (sic)
