Veteran commentator Clive Tyldesley has reportedly been sacked from featuring on future Soccer Aid matches after he was criticised for 'fat-shaming' players during this year's event.

The match was aired on ITV in September and featured former players and celebrities taking on each other in an England vs Rest of the World clash in a bid to raise money for charity.

But according to The Sun two players among the England team in Tom Davis and Chunkz were left 'devastated' after being 'fat shamed' by Tyldesley during his commentary of the game.

Chunkz was a first half substitute early on, replacing comedian Davis in attack during the encounter at Old Trafford which England lost on penalties following a 1-1 draw that raised Â£11million.

As the rapper, 24, came on, Tyldesley said: 'Tom Davis is about to be replaced, and by somebody bigger than him.'

Later jibes at Chunkz included Tyldesley saying he was so big you could 'take guided tours around him'.

An insider told The Sun: 'Clive's been told he won't be back for next year's Soccer Aid because of the comments he made. It was clear that while Clive thought he was just having a laugh, no one really found his jokes funny, let alone Tom and Chunkz who bore the brunt of them.

'Soccer Aid raises millions for children and is watched by kids and young people across the UK. Having them listen to someone like Clive then mocking players for their weight seems totally unacceptable.

'Clive understands why he won't be back.

'And it will be put forward as them bringing in new blood when it comes to the commentators on next year's game.'

The news caps off a miserable year for the 66-year-old having already been replaced as ITV's No 1 commentator following 22 years in the role back in July.
