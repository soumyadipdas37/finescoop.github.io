She got the all-clear in December 2014, and finally had her five-year discharge appointment last November. 

And, Carol McGiffin, 60, branded husband Mark Cassidy, 36, her 'absolute rock' as she got candid about her breast cancer battle.

The Loose Women star also insisted that 'no kids' is the key to their 'great life,' as she opened up in a new interview.

In a chat with OK! Magazine, Carol said of her cancer battle: 'I don't think I'd have made it through without him. Mark was my absolute rock.'

The presenter revealed that she knew she had cancer in early 2014 when the couple were on holiday in Thailand.

She said: 'I knew straight away what it was. As soon as I got home I got it checked out, I wouldn't let Mark come with me.

'I knew in my heart the diagnosis and I was fine hearing it.'

After the doctors confirmed what she'd suspected, she and Mark went to the pub and got 'roaring drunk.' 

In terms of treatment, Carol explained how her mastectomy came first, before she had chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Discussing how she felt when her hair fell out, the presenter explained that at first she tried the 'cold cap,' but it was too uncomfortable.

Carol soon decided to embrace the process, knowing her hair would 'grow back,' and said that as soon as her hair began falling out, Mark shaved it off for her. 

The couple, who have been together for 12 years - met at a Loose Women wrap party, and Carol acknowledged that things 'moved pretty quickly' from that point.

Mark revealed that although they met in August, they had moved in together by December - just four months later.  

The couple got engaged in 2008 but waited ten years to tie the knot, which they did in secret in Bangkok. 

Their 22-year age difference got a lot of people talking when they first went public with their romance, and Carol admitted: 'It's nice to prove everyone wrong.' 

The Loose Women panellist explained why she thinks they're so happy, saying: 'We have no responsibilities and have a great life - we have no kids, that's why!'
