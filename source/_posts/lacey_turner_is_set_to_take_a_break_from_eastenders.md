Lacey Turner is reportedly set to take a lengthy break from EastEnders just as her character Stacey Fowler has returned to Albert Square.

The actress, 32, will be back on screens this week after she went on maternity leave for a year with her daughter Dusty, fourteen months. 

According to the Daily Star, Lacey's return will be a brief one as she will be off the soap again by the end of the year, with bosses currently plotting her temporary departure. 

Break: Lacey Turner, 32, is reportedly set to take a lengthy break from EastEnders just as her character Stacey Fowler has returned to Albert Square

An insider said: 'Lacey will be taking a break. The top bosses agreed to give her some time off from the show.

'This is a great opportunity for the writers to come up with something big for Lacey to get her teeth into.'

The source added that Lacey will return to the soap within the year and there are no plans for her to permanently leave EastEnders.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Lacey and EastEnders for comment. 

Departure: According to the Daily Star, Lacey's return will be a brief one as she will be off the soap again by the end of the year, with bosses currently plotting her temporary departure

Last year, Stacey bashed Phil Mitchell over the head and left him for dead, before she fled Walford. 

She also split up from husband Martin Fowler (James Bye) and has since been dating a man named Jerome.

Meanwhile, tensions are undoubtedly set to rise as Martin has moved on with her best friend Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton). 

Speaking about Martin and Ruby's romance, Lacey told Digital Spy: 'I think for Stacey, she just felt angry towards Ruby – that's supposed to be her best friend.

An insider said: 'Lacey will be taking a break. The top bosses agreed to give her some time off from the show'

'She's really sad about her and Martin. In her heart of hearts she does still love him and I think it's quite hard her to watch them together.

'But in true Stacey style, she will just put on a front and pretend she doesn't care. She thinks that it's not that serious and that he's there for the money. She definitely doesn't think it's going to last forever.'  

Lacey added she thinks Stacey is still 'very much in love' with her ex and would take him back tomorrow if she could.  

Stacey's return to EastEnders airs on Monday September 20 at 8:05pm on BBC One.
