Irena and Locky are now officially out of hiding after The Bachelor grand finale aired on Thursday night.

'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told Irena.
