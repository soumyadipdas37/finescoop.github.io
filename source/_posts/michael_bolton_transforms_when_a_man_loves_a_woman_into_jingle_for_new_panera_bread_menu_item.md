Two-time Grammy winner Michael Bolton transformed his 1991 cover of Percy Sledge's 1966 song When a Man Loves a Woman into a slow-jam jingle for a new Panera Bread menu item - Broccoli Cheddar Mac & Cheese.

'When some mac loves broccoli cheddar!' the 67-year-old R&B belter crooned in the commercial.

'Yes, it's soup on tender pasta/ It can do no wrong/ 'Cause creamy cheese and broccoli loves macaroni.'

'I got just the thing!' Two-time Grammy winner Michael Bolton transformed his 1991 cover of Percy Sledge's 1966 song When a Man Loves a Woman into a slow-jam jingle for a new Panera Bread menu item - Broccoli Cheddar Mac & Cheese

The funny spot concludes with Bolton (born Bolotin) singing on the steps of a massive mansion beside a swimming pool as fireworks explode in the background.

Starting Thursday, Panera Bread customers can buy the $8.89 mash-up meal - featuring 53 grams of fat and 770 calories - which includes a French baguette.

'I actually got a sneak peek yesterday of the Broccoli Cheddar Mac & Cheese and it's delicious!' Michael told Thursday's episode of TODAY.

'It's an insanely craveable and irresistible creation that our customers nationwide are sure to love,' the Swedish foodie gushed.

Expect more menu mash-ups and combinations in the future as Panera has reportedly 'pledged to make 50% of its menu vegan or vegetarian over the next several years.'
