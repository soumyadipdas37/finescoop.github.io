Victoria has recorded 15 new coronavirus cases and five deaths overnight.

Melbourne's 14-day rolling average of new cases has dropped from 32.8 on Monday to 29.4 on Wednesday.

The case range must be between 30 to 50 for the state to move into the next phase of recovery, but premier Daniel Andrews has refused to say whether restrictions will ease.
