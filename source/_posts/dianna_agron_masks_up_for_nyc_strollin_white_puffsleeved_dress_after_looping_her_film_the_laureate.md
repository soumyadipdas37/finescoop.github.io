Glee alum Dianna Agron strolled past McNally Jackson Books on Prince Street in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood on Thursday with another woman.

The 34-year-old SAG Award winner made sure to protect herself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a surgical mask, which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made mandatory for public outings way back on April 15.

As of Thursday, there have been over 240K confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City leading to 23,708 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University.

Agron was wearing a white puff-sleeved midi-dress with matching sandals as she toted a straw bag.

Dianna was noticeably not wearing her wedding ring following Us Weekly's August 19 article that she's been 'living separately' from her husband, Mumford & Sons banjoist Winston Marshall, since 'last year.'

October 15th would've marked the Georgia-born blonde and the 32-year-old Englishman's fourth wedding anniversary, but she's reportedly been 'dating.'

Single? Dianna was not wearing her wedding ring following reports she's been 'living separately' from her husband, Mumford & Sons banjoist Winston Marshall, since 'last year'

And while Agron and Marshall reportedly still follow each other on Instagram, she has pretty much wiped all evidence of her ex from her page.

Over the last month, Dianna has been hard at work doing ADR looping sessions for her role as American writer Laura Riding in William Nunez's upcoming movie The Laureate.

In the 1920s-set biopic - which wrapped production February 12 - the Berlin, I Love You director-star plays the live-in mistress of real-life British poet Robert Graves (Tom Hughes).

Agron also portrays Kim in Emma Seligman's Jewish comedy Shiva Baby, which will next screen September 11-13 at the Deauville American Film Festival in France.

Dianna is still mourning the 'tremendous loss' of her former Glee castmate Naya Rivera who accidentally drowned, at age 33, while swimming in Lake Piru with her four-year-old son Josey Hollis on July 8.

Over 52K people have signed Erin Jordan's Change.org petition to put up signs warning swimmers about the 130ft-deep SoCal lake known locally for unpredictable currents and 'bad whirlpools.'
