A studio apartment with a bed suspended over the stairs and a bookcase to stop you 'falling to your death' shocked Twitter users after it went up for sale for £125,000.  

The flat, which was listed on real estate site OnTheMarket before being taken down earlier this week, was promoted as a 'spacious and well-converted' top floor studio with a kitchen area and separate bathroom. 

 Twitter user unfortunatalie shared the unusual listing in Pavilion Road, Worthing, West Sussex, on the platform and joked 'Move to the south the possibilities are endless' while others questioned why the owner felt the need to attach the bed to the wall when there was 'perfectly adequate floor space'. 

The unusual property in Worthing, West Sussex, was put on real estate site OnTheMarket and listed for £125,000 but Twitter users were left confused by the bizarre bed frame that had been created and attached to the wall above the stairs 

The owners promoted the property as 'spacious and well converted', sharing pictures of the bed frame that had been constructed over the stairs to save some precious floor space

Horrifed Twitter user unfortunatalie shared the unusual listing on her profile with the caption 'move to the south the possibilities are endless' 

Also included in the promotional pictures for the property in Worthing was an outside shot which showed the shabby and unkempt exterior of the terraced house

The description for the property, which is only a few hundred metres away from Worthing station, read: 'A spacious and well converted top floor studio flat with south facing double glazed windows. 

But Twitter users were particularly horrified by the phrase 'The studio room has a built-in bed over the stairs' and were even more startled when they saw pictures of the flat. 

Promotional pictures for the studio apartment revealed the current owners, in a bid to create more space, had constructed a bed frame, which they attached to the wall and had a small step ladder to the side to get into it. 

Annie Beauchamp took to the comments to express her disbelief that the current owner of the property felt the need to create the unusual bed frame, stating there was adequate floor space for a bed

Also included in the £125,000 price tag was a separate bathroom with a 'white suite' and a cabinet specifically designed to house the washing machine

Twitter users expressed their concern that the potential new owners of the property could 'fall to their death' in the night if they rolled over. Pictured: The kitchen, described as open plan

Also included in the £125,000 price tag was an 'open plan kitchen' and 'white bathroom suite' which houses the owner's washing machine. 

The pictures also provided a snapshot of the property from the outside, which looked unkempt. 

One person questioned whether the bed layout was even legal, suggesting someone could roll out of bed and die after falling down the steep stairs below.

Others responded that after 'having studied it in horror', they believed the small bookcase that had been attached to the ceiling and placed next to the bed was in fact to prevent people falling off. 







People were dumbfounded by the odd decision to secure the structure to the wall and above the stairs, with some joking that the current owners had 'clearly spared no expense in the conversion'

Joining in on the discussion, other people shared some of the horrifying prices home owners expect tenants to pay for their properties.  

For example, Jaye Kearney posted a screenshot of an outhouse in someone's back garden that was available to rent for a whopping £900.  

Another person shared a picture of a listing they had seen a few years ago when searching for their new home. 

Jaye Kearney replied to the original tweet to share a property she had come across when looking for a new place which was priced at a whopping £900 a month for an outhouse in someone's back garden 

Another Londonder took to the comments to show others the odd property they had stumbled across a few years ago which featured a bath tub over the stairs in a bid to save space in the master bedroom

To save floor space, the owner of the property had placed a bath tub over the stairs in the master bedroom. 

Others joked that they were going to keep the pictures of the apartment in Worthing close by to look at when they felt unhappy about their current living situation.

Rich Wall joked that the new owners of this unusual set up could shave some precious minutes off their commute each day by simply rolling out of bed and falling down the stairs. 



Other people joked that they were going to keep a hold of the pictures to make them feel better about their living situation and one said it may save several seconds on the new owners commute if they fell from the stairs
