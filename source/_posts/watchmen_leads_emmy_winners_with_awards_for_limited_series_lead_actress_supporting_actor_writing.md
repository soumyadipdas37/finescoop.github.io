It was great night for HBO at the 2020 Emmy Awards in LA on Sunday night.

And leading the way for the premium cable and streaming service was the dark superhero series Watchmen which won top honors in four major categories during the Jimmy Kimmel-hosted telecast.

Watchmen, based on a 1980s graphic novel, won the Emmys for outstanding limited series, best actress, best supporting actor and best writing. 

Nabbed trophies: HBO's Watchmen, based on a 1980s graphic comic and depicting white supremacy and police brutality, led the pack at the 2020 Emmys Sunday with four major wins

The series, which debuted last year, depicts white supremacists, police brutality and rows over mask-wearing, making it a timely piece of theatre that taps into the current zeitgeist of the United States.

Accepting the Emmy for outstanding limited series, Damon Lindelof and Cord Jefferson  dedicated their win to African-American victims of the 1921 Tulsa massacre.

'The only way to put the fires out is to fight them together,' said showrunner Lindelof.

'History is mystery -- it's broken into a million puzzle pieces. We know finding them will hurt. Sometimes we caused that hurt, maybe we even benefited from it,' added Lindelof, who is white.

The winners of the Emmys this year accepted their awards from home, giving their acceptance speeches via remote camera link up. 

Regina King, who won the lead actress Emmy for her work in Watchmen, was seen sitting in an armchair wearing a T-shirt that honored police shooting victim Breonna Taylor.

'This is so freaking weird,' the 49-year-old commented after being showered with confetti when her name was announced

Explaining why she was wearing the t-shirt, she said: 'Wearing Breonna´s likeness and representing her and her family and the stories that we were exploring, presenting and holding a mirror up to on Watchmen, it felt appropriate to represent with Breonna Taylor.'

She added: 'The cops still haven´t been held accountable. She represents just decades, hundreds of years of violence against Black bodies.'

'Watchmen was a story about trauma': King's co-star, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, won the Emmy for best supporting actor in a limited series

King's co-star, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, won the Emmy for best supporting actor in a limited series.

In his remarks, he shared: 'Watchmen was a story about trauma, and the lasting scars of white domestic terrorism, police corruption and brutality.' 

In total, Watchmen took home 11 Emmys after racking up wins at the Creative Arts Emmys handed out for technical achievements.

That left the show two Emmys short of the all-time record of 13 held by historical mini-series John Adams. 

Dutch courage: ABC's late night host Jimmy Kimmel served as emcee of the Emmys that were radically different from any other major awards show in Hollywood history

Pandemic mode: The awards show took place without an audience at LA's Staples Center and with the night's winners providing their acceptance speeches via video link

Fellow HBO show Succession - the saga of a powerful, backstabbing family - won big in the prestigious drama categories, while offbeat Canadian hit Schitt's Creek performed a clean sweep of the night's comedy prizes. 

ABC late night talk show host Kimmel\ emcee'd proceedings from the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.

There was no live star-studded audience and just a handful of celebrities who took part in person in the telecast after undergoing testing for COVID-19 and remaining socially distanced.
