Friday was the 19th anniversary of the terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda on the United States.

And Kaia Gerber's new boyfriend Jacob Elordi seemed to give a nod to 9/11 as he wore a Peace Is Power sweatshirt after visiting a NYC gym.

The 19-year-old Vogue supermodel and the 23-year-old Euphoria actor were holding hands again after putting on their first public display of affection on their way to dinner earlier this week.

Never forget: Friday was the 19th anniversary of the terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda on the United States. And Kaia Gerber's new boyfriend Jacob Elordi seemed to give a nod to 9/11 as he wore a Peace Is Power sweatshirt after visiting a NYC gym

Kaia looked at her tall boyfriend as they walked in step in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City.

The Malibu native had on a light grey sweatshirt that read Notre Dame. It is not sure why she chose that sweatshirt as her father Rande Gerber attended University Of Arizona and her mother Cindy Crawford dropped out of Northwestern University to launch her modeling career.

Kaia added black micro shorts by Alo and wore white New Balance sneakers with white socks. She added a face mask and blue NY cap while a brown purse rested on her shoulder.

Jacob of The Kissing Booth fame had on a bright blue Peace Is Power sweatshirt with Nike shorts and white socks and sneakers as he added bracelets, rings and a watch.

He too had on a cap and face mask as he held two notebooks in his right hand. 

Elordi seemed protective of Gerber as he put his hand on her back while she entered a shop.

On Wednesday evening the duo proved they are indeed an item as they not only held hands but also put their arms around each other.

The lovebirds were spotted on their way to a cozy al fresco dinner for two.

The pair seemed to be very into each other as they could not keep far apart during the stroll through the city. They were in step as they held hands then at one point the Australian actor put his arms around the teen. 

Earlier in the day they were seen on another walk but there was no PDA.

News of their romance spread like wildfire earlier this month.

Celebrity Instagram account deuxmoi, which posts texts and DMs from followers about celebrity encounters, shared several stories about the rumored couple in New York City. 

The two were seen out in the city by various people, with one follower submitting a photo of the couple holding hands.

The lookers were then seen hanging out Washington Square Park, followed by dinner at Bar Pitti. 'I just saw Jacob Elordi and Kaia Gerber on a date in nyc and the beauty those two hold' a fan tweeted. 

Jacob has been linked to his former Euphoria co-star Zendaya and Joey King, whom he starred with in The Kissing Booth.

Jacob and Zendaya first landed at the center of dating rumors after they were spotted on a getaway to Greece back in August 2019.

While the two never announced their relationship, a source confirmed the actors were indeed dating in an Us Weekly report in February 2020. 

Jacob's recent outings with Kaia have sparked speculation his relationship with Zendaya has ended.  

Kaia was previously in a relationship with SNL star Pete Davidson, but recently landed at the center dating rumors with fellow model Cara Delevingne when the duo were spotted affectionately embracing at a Black Lives Matter rally in July.

Not only that, but the women also got matching 'Solemate' tattoos on their feet in August.
