A thrifty shopper has shown off her incredible grocery bargain buys with mark down stickers displaying their astonishingly low prices. 

The mother, from Perth, said she was doing her grocery about 2pm on Monday at Coles when noticed an employee heavily discounting the items in the meat aisle.

As she 'hovered' closely behind him, she managed to fill her shopping trolley with pork shoulder roasts from $3.49, corned beef for $1.32, a whole chicken for $1.78, scotch fillet for $3.03 and steaks for less than half price.

Her grocery bill came to a total of $58 after she saved a whopping $184.

'Cleaned up at Coles. Hope the markdown guy didn't notice me following him,' the woman wrote in a Facebook group, along with a laughing emoji.

'I hovered nearby in the bakery and as soon as he moved on, I'd swoop in.'

Among her grocery haul are three packs of pork shoulder roast weighing nearly two kilos each, a whole chicken for just $1.78, two corned beef from just $1.32 each and 1.7kg of beef steaks from just $9.54.

Hundreds of shoppers were impressed with her winning discounts, with one woman describing it as the 'score of the century'.

'That's a month's worth of meat there for not much money,' one shopper said, while another added: 'I haven't had a haul like that in ages.'

Many customers also confessed they always 'follow the mark down workers' when they do their grocery shop.

'Yes I hoover around them,' one woman said, while another added: 'Love to stalk the markdown person. Great bargains. Enjoy.'

One shopper said she always warns the markdown workers at the supermarket that she would be 'lurking' behind them. 

'I usually get a laugh out of them,' she said. 

Another customer said: 'I always feel a little embarrassed for "hovering" but then I think about all the money I'm saving and keep standing there.' 

One man who lives in Melbourne said he usually goes to Woolworths and Coles about 45 minutes before closing time just so he can score bargains.

'As Coles and Woolworths shut at 7.30pm at the moment [due to COVID-19 lockdown], I get there about 6.45pm to 7pm and hover around like a wasp at a picnic. I even make them mark down stuff,' he said.

A Coles employee also responded to the thread, saying: 'When I did ticketing at Coles, there were always one or two people lurking, browsing along after me.' 

Among her grocery haul are two giant corned beef weighing nearly one kilo each for just $1.32

The mother also scored prosciutto wrapped chicken breasts for just $2, normally retails at $10

She also scored pork sirloin steak for just $1.47 and pork scotch fillet from as little as $3.03

Australian supermarket stores are discounting items progressively through the day, with 20, 40, 60, 80 and even 99 per cent slashed off the retail prices.

There are no set day for markdowns as products go out of date constantly - but bargain hunters suggest the best times to shop are either early in the morning or shortly before closing time.

Stores slash prices off perishables in a bid to sell whatever they can before binning it or donating to charities.

Some curious shoppers asked whether the meat would 'go bad' as the products were purchased on the same day they were due to expire.

But many shoppers suggested as long as the woman freezes them upon arriving home, it's 'safe' to consume, while one shopper explaining: 'If you freeze it and get it out and cook it on the day you want to use it, it's ok.'

One shopper responded: 'Well that changes the whole game. I'll be on the lookout for the markdown guy from now one.' 

Supermarkets tend to discount items progressively through the day, with 20, 40, 60, 80 and eventually 99 per cent slashed off the retail prices of popular items.
