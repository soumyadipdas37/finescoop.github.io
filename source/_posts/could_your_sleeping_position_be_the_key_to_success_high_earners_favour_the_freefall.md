From the 'freefall' to the 'foetal', the differing sleeping positions favoured by high and lower earners have been revealed.

A survey of more than 5,000 British professionals found 29 per cent of those earning more than £54,900 a year prefer to sleep with their arms and legs spread out either side of them – a position known as 'the freefall'. 

By contrast, 29 per cent of people earning less than that figure prefer the foetal position, followed by the 'pillow hugger'.

Christabel Majendie, a sleep expert at Naturalmat, shared her expertise after the survey by Onbuy.com. She said: 'Poor-quality sleep is associated with reduced daytime performance, and this includes your professional life.'

'It is important to be comfortable when you sleep so consider your mattress and bedding. Sleep in a position that is comfortable for you – this varies from person to person.'
