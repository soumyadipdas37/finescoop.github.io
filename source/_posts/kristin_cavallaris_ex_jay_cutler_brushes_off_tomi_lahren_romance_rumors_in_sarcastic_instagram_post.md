Kristin Cavallari's ex Jay Cutler is speaking up after reports he enjoyed date night with conservative pundit Tomi Lahren in Nashville last week.

The former NFL quarterback, 37, tried to diffuse the romance rumors with a sarcastic Instagram post, sharing a video of himself brushing his beloved cow Ruby and writing 'Only lady in my life' in the caption.

'Be better internet,' Jay added to his post, which emerged the morning after Tomi, 28, brushed off the same gossip on her Twitter account.

Not happening: Jay Cutler hit back at rumors he and Tomi Lahren are dating in a sarcastic Instagram post shared after he and the Fox News pundit were spotted out in Nashville last week

'I love it when the internet tells me who I’m dating. Good one,' the South Dakota-born Fox News face wrote.

Romance rumors first got traction after the pair were seen 'enjoying a nice night out together at Winners Bar in Nashville on Friday,' an insider told E! News.

But other sources say that Jay and Tomi - who are both recently single - are nothing more than friends, noting the pair were not alone during the supposed 'date.'

Another source told E!: 'The two of them were having a lot of fun together at a table along with two other friends. Tomi and Jay were passing a bottle of tequila back and forth and taking shots together directly from the bottle.'

'The two of them left together,' the insider went on, still leaving are they/aren't they question up in the air.

Either way, the pair seem to be getting close. Tomi has been commenting on Jay's Instagram, leaving fans to wonder if it was flirting or simply friendly internet banter.

'This is already more entertaining than the E! Show...' she wrote under a post of Jay's roosters back at the end of June, keeping on brand by adding an unrelated American flag emoji at the end.

The diss was aimed at Very Cavallari, the reality show of Jay's ex/co-parent Kristen, 33.

The potential love connection caused a stir on social media, with some joking about Cutler's past battles on the gridiron, with others referring to Lahren's outspoken political views 

'It just wasn't in the cards,' Lahren told People, adding that she and Fricke remained 'best friends.'

Geographically, the two celebs are in better position to bond, as Lahren recently moved to Nashville, where Cutler already resided.
