Manchester United's youth revelation looks like it will be seeing a new recruit in the form of Atletico Madrid wonderkid Alejandro Garnacho.

The Red Devils have reportedly fended off interest from Europe's elite to sign the 16-year-old attacker, who is set to sign a five-year contract at Old Trafford.

But who is he? Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the player that many believe is set for stardom in the near future.

Man United are set to sign Atletico Madrid starlet Alejandro Garnacho on a five-year deal

Born in Getafe in July 2004, Alejandro Garnacho is one of Atletico Madrid's most highly-rated prospects and has been described as a 'goalscoring machine' while in the club's youth ranks.

He joined the club's academy in 2015 and hasn't looked back, shining brightest among Atletico's other starlets.

He is technically gifted and has superb ball control, making him a nightmare to defend when he's running at opposition's backlines.

In front of goal he's just as lethal and is extremely intuitive in and around the area. So much so that, whilst playing Atletico's Infantil B, he became Spain's top goalscorer in 2016 as he tore defences in the youth league apart.

Garnacho is predominantly right-footed but is comfortable on his left, allowing him that versatility when one-on-one with the goalkeeper.

While he is able to use his quick feet to beat defenders and round goalkeepers with ease, the teenager also has the knack of finding himself in the right spot at the right time, always hungry to pick up the scraps in front of goal. 

He will be looking to emulate his game on his idol, Cristiano Ronaldo, who played a big part in him making the move to Old Trafford given the Portuguese's links to the Premier League club.

Along with United, both Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund have been keeping tabs on the teenager but a move to England is where he looks set to end up.

Having turned 16 at the beginning of July, Garnacho was free to discuss terms with other clubs while reports in Spain suggested that Atletico did 'everything in their power' in trying to convince him to stay.

The forward had featured for Atletico's Under 19s but is set to star in United's academy after agreeing a five-year deal.

United will owe the Spanish giants a compensation package for training and development.

Garnacho will now compete with Mateo Mejia, who United signed from Real Zaragoza last year, in attack for the U18s, while Joe Hugill and Dillon Hoogewerf remain in the mix for appearances.
