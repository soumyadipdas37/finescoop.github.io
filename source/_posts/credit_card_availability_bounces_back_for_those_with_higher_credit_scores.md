Borrowers with better credit scores have found it easier to open a credit card since July as banks begin to turn the lending taps back on, new data suggests.

Figures from the credit rating agency Experian found half of those searching for a credit card last month were shown at least one they were guaranteed to get, up from 24 per cent in July.

Some 55 per cent were shown at least one pre-approved card at the start of March, suggesting a recovery to pre-coronavirus levels.

Experian found half of consumers were shown at least one credit card they were guaranteed to get in August, just below pre-coronavirus levels in March

However, the increase was driven by borrowers deemed more creditworthy by the rating agency, with a 33 point increase in the percentage of those with 'good' scores shown a guaranteed card between July and August, and a 37 percentage point increase among those with 'excellent' scores.

Experian's Amir Goshtai said there had been 'significant improvements in the credit market' over the past few weeks, with 50 per cent more credit cards available in August than in July and more consumers becoming eligible for personal loans.

He said the growth in credit card availability 'had been impacted more by changes in lenders' appetite for risk.'

Britain has begun borrowing again, with the latest figures from the Bank of England finding consumers borrowed more than they paid back in July for the first time since February, but the amount being borrowed on credit cards and loans is still around a fifth lower than the pre-coronavirus average.

Credit card and personal loan lending in July was 29 per cent lower than the same month last year, according to figures published Monday by the Finance and Leasing Association.



And although more consumers were being shown credit cards they were guaranteed to get, Experian's data did not include whether they were given the advertised APR or a higher one, or a lower credit limit. 

When This is Money checked, the only cards we were pre-approved for - with an excellent credit score - were offered by Capital One and came with a 37 per cent APR, much higher than the average rate of 25.2 per cent.

John Crossley, head of money at comparison site Compare the Market, said they were also 'seeing some lenders come back to the market, but they remain cautious, with their appetite for risk remaining below pre-lockdown levels.'



A survey of lenders by the Bank of England in June found they expected the availability of credit cards and loans to decrease between July and September and to tighten their lending criteria, although not as much as between April and June when they had to support existing millions of customers with three month payment holidays.

Mr Crossley added: 'Although there are options available, it's worth checking the small print and terms and conditions. Those on offer are likely to have conditions such as lower credit limits or higher interest rates.'

Andrew Hagger, the founder of personal finance site Moneycomms, also warned consumers to check the details of any deals they were offered to see if the cost of a credit card was higher than advertised.

And although they have increased slightly since July, the number of available interest-free credit card deals remains close to a record low, according to data from Moneyfacts.

In January there were 70 interest-free purchase and 76 balance transfer credit card deals available, but this fell to 53 and 57 by the start of September, with 0 per cent term lengths also shortening.

'It's worth taking the time to check whether you could be eligible for a credit card by using a soft eligibility checker which prevents damaging your credit rating and allows you to see the most appropriate deals for your financial circumstances which you could be accepted for', John Crossley said.

One bank not eager to hand out more credit to borrowers is the smartphone-only credit card provider Tandem Bank.

On 2 November the bank will close both its credit builder journey card, which has a 24.9 per cent APR and its cashback card, which was closed to new customers in December.

The card was relaunched as a completely interest-free deal with a £5.99 membership fee in January, which required customers to spend £1,200 a month in order to earn enough cashback, at a rate of 0.5 per cent, to cover it.

Customers will earn cashback until 2 November and have it credited to them, and will see any money they are owed transferred to their bank account after they close their account.

Meanwhile borrowers will have until 3 February 2021 to clear their balance.

Chief executive Ricky Knox said: 'The impact of coronavirus on the way people are now spending in the "new normal", coupled with a strategic decision to invest in upgrading the core banking technology that underpins Tandem's products and services, led us to the decision to withdraw our current credit card offering.

'That doesn't mean we won't be offering a "spend" solution again, but simply means our immediate focus will be on building the very best savings products we can and helping more and more of our customers fund their green home investments.'
