Wentworth, which is a fresh take on iconic 1980s series Prisoner, has garnered plenty of critical acclaim, winning several AACTA and Logie awards over the years.

It has also aired in several countries, including New Zealand, the UK and Ireland, where it has developed a devoted fan base.

The Foxtel produced series was also popular with Australian audiences who even petitioned hard to save the show from cancellation after the seventh season.

Despite this, the drama proved too expensive and limited to continue funding, leading Foxtel to confirm season eight would be Wentworth's final season.

Part one of season eight is currently airing on screens. Part two will air next year.
