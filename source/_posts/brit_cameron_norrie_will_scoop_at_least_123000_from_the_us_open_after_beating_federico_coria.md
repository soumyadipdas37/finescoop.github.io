Cameron Norrie booked himself a highly lucrative berth in the third round of the US Open on Wednesday night by achieving his best result at a Grand Slam.

The British No 3 is the kind of player who will properly notice the £123,000 prize money that accompanies making the last 32 at a Major, and he now has the chance to go even further.

World No 77 Norrie won a gruelling baseline battle on a deserted outside court when he ousted Argentina's Federico Coria 6-3 6-4 6-4.

The British No 3 won a gruelling baseline battle against Argentina's Federico Coria 6-3 6-4 6-4

He now faces highly-rated Spanish prospect Alejandro Davidovitch Fokina, who at a ranking of 99 is nonetheless a relatively benign draw at this level of competition.

Norrie was once again showing the benefits of playing plenty of matches from July onwards and it was a highly impressive bounceback from the five sets it took to oust another Argentinian, Diego Schwartzman, in the first round.

Coria is the younger brother of one-time French Open finalist Guillermo, who reached No 3 in the world. 

Coria was not in the class of Norrie and was eventually left behind, losing in straight sets

He is not in that class and Norrie was gradually able to carve him open using his left-handed angles.

Largely raised in New Zealand by British parents, Norrie is never more at home than on the hard courts of America, where he was a standout college player, and it showed.

It helped that he was able to save twelve out of 13 break points and he was able to fend off a determined fightback from Coria in the final set, who threw caution to the wind before being broken for 5-4 in the decider.
