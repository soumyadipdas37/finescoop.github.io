On Tuesday evening the duo proved they are indeed an item as they not only held hands but also put their arms around each other.

The pair seemed to be very into each other as they could not keep far apart during the stroll through the city.  

News of their romance spread like wildfire earlier this month.

Celebrity Instagram account deuxmoi, which posts texts and DMs from followers about celebrity encounters, shared several stories about the rumored couple in New York City. 

The two were seen out in the city by various people, with one follower submitting a photo of the couple holding hands.

The lookers were then seen hanging out Washington Square Park, followed by dinner at Bar Pitti. 'I just saw Jacob Elordi and Kaia Gerber on a date in nyc and the beauty those two hold' a fan tweeted. 

Jacob has been linked to his former Euphoria co-star Zendaya and Joey King, whom he starred with in The Kissing Booth.

Jacob and Zendaya first landed at the center of dating rumors after they were spotted on a getaway to Greece back in August 2019.

While the two never announced their relationship, a source confirmed the actors were indeed dating in an Us Weekly report in February 2020. 

Jacob's recent outings with Kaia have sparked speculation his relationship with Zendaya has ended.  

Kaia was previously in a relationship with SNL star Pete Davidson, but recently landed at the center dating rumors with fellow model Cara Delevingne when the duo were spotted affectionately embracing at a Black Lives Matter rally in July.

Not only that, but the women also got matching 'Solemate' tattoos on their feet in August.
