She's the feisty Pakistani beauty who failed to win Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor.

And on Thursday, Areeba Emmanuel turned heads in a bright pink outfit while out and about in Sydney's Surry Hills, ahead of the grand finale airing.

The 25-year-old wowed in a neon pink boob tube top, matched with a midi length skirt that clung onto her figure.

The raven haired beauty styled her long and luscious locks in a half up pony tail, allowing the rest of her tresses to cascade down.

She accessorised her look with silver rosary-style necklace and black heels, as she toted a big paper bag as she crossed the street with a gal pal.

For makeup, Areeba opted for a glamorous look with false lashes and a glossy plump pout.

Last month, she spoke proudly of being the first Pakistani woman on the reality show, telling The Liverpool City Champion: 'It was an honour to be the first Pakistani girl on The Bachelor and national TV.'

The beauty then explained often times Pakistani women are turned off from doing the show for a number of reasons.

'Girls from my country don't really get to do something like this, or they don't think they are good enough to do something like this,' she said.

In the grand final on Thursday, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with Irena over Bella Varelis.

He told her: 'When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.'

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'

Happy ending! In the end, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with Irena
