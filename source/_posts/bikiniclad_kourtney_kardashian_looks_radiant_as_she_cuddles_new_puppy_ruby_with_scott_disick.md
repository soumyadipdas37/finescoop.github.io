Kourtney Kardashian enjoyed a day out with ex Scott Disick on Sunday as they treated son Reign, five, to a boat trip.

The reality star, 41, looked incredible in an orange bikini as she hit the high seas with her new poodle puppy, Ruby.

Kourtney and Scott, 37, appeared to be cruising around the gorgeous Lake Coeur d'Alene in Idaho, where pals Justin Bieber and wife Hailey also happen to be staying this weekend.

Scott documented the entire day out on the lake on his Instagram Story, first with a portrait of himself manning the motorboat as Kourtney and Reign relaxed.

Scott had on a vibrant floral shirt and swim trunks, while Kourtney put her curves on display in a neon pink two piece suit and a coverup.

Reign, rocking his newly shaved head, had on a white tank top, a pair of aqua blue swim trunks, and a life vest as he clung onto his mom. 

He followed up the family shot with one that showed his 'baby driver' Reign holding onto the steering wheel as he sat in Scott's lap.

To show off the awesome boat they have been using throughout their getaway, Disick uploaded a wide shot of him and some of his closest pals hanging out on the water.

Kourtney also shared snapshots from the outing to her personal Instagram Story, but most were to show off her sensational swimwear.

'say hi to Ruby,' wrote the POOSH founder who posed with her new Poodle puppy as she set on the edge of her family's rental boat.

In her solo snap, Kourtney switched out of her pink two piece and slipped into a neon orange bikini that accentuated her glowing tan.

Her raven tresses poked out from underneath a blue Supreme sunhat and she had a pair of brown sunglasses over her eyes.

Kardashian's darling dog Ruby looked more than content in the former reality star's grasp.

Although they were not pictured at Sunday's outing, Scott and Kourtney also share son Mason, 10, and daughter Penelope, eight.

The former couple split in 2015 after nine-years together, but have remained close friends and expert co-parents.

Scott, Kourtney, and their three children spent a large majority of the summer at an oceanside rental property in Malibu, where they were often seen hanging out on their deck or playing on the beach.

Meanwhile, Scott's ex girlfriend Sofia Richie was spotted enjoying an affectionate beach date with her longtime pal and former flame Jaden Smith, 22, on Saturday.

The pair, who reportedly dated in 2012 when they were just 14, romped around in the water, held hands, and even enjoyed a lovingly embrace on the sand.

Two-months after their breakup, the pair reunited at a Fourth Of July party in Malibu. 

But by mid-August, numerous outlets reported that Scott and Sofia decided to end their relationship for good.
