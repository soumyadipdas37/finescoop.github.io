The family of a man murdered in 2013 have been informed after workmen discovered what is believed to be a human skull in Nottingham. 

The suspected human remains were found within scrubland off Rossington Road in the city's Sneinton area shortly after midday.  

Police are looking into several lines of enquiry, including whether it is linked to any historic investigations, as forensic examinations and a wider search of the area are being carried out. 

The suspected human remains were found within scrubland off Rossington Road in the city's Sneinton area shortly after midday

One of the lines of enquiry is whether the discovery may be linked to the murder of 50-year-old Kevin Kennedy eight years ago. 

Mr Kennedy's next of kin has been informed of today's discovery.

Peter Healy, 51, of Lord Nelson Street, Sneinton, was convicted of his murder in 2013 and ordered to serve a minimum of 21 years. 

Forensic examinations and a wider search of the area are being carried out as police follow several lines of enquiry. One line is whether it may be linked to the murder of 50-year-old Kevin Kennedy eight years ago

Healy was also sentenced to five years for perverting the course of justice and given the concurrent sentence for concealing or disposing of Mr Kennedy's remains. 

Detective Inspector Steve Wragg, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'Our investigations are still in their early stages and we remain open-minded as to whether these suspected human remains may be linked to any historic cases. 

'It is now essential that we complete a detailed and thorough wider search of the area to establish if any further remains are present.

'Specialist DNA and dental tests will now be carried out on the bones as part of the identification process.'
