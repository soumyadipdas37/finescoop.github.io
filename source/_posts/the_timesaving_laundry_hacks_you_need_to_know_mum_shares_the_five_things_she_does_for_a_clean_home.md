Mila's first trick is that you should always add half a cup of baking soda to your wash when you have a full load (pictured) as this is a natural deodoriser and cleaner and softens your clothes

1. Add baking soda to your wash

Mila's first trick is that you should always add half a cup of baking soda to your wash when you have a full load.

'Adding baking soda to the wash allows you to use less detergent, and it softens and brightens your clothes,' Mila explained.

Baking soda is a natural deodoriser and cleanser, and it also softens the water, which means you can get away with using less detergent.

Mila said this trick even works for your bed linen and towels if you want to make them look brighter.

Mila has a simple technique to avoid losing socks in the washing machine, and all you have to do is tie the socks together before you put them in the washing machine (pictured)

2. Tie socks together

If you've ever put a full wash on only to struggle to find pairs of socks at the end, you're not alone. 

But Mila has a simple technique to avoid this once and for all, and all you have to do is tie the socks together before you put them in the washing machine.

'By doing this, I can make sure none go missing,' she said.

Another good trick for a big family is to hang items on your clothes horse at home on hangers as it increases the amount of clothes you can hang (pictured)

Mila recommends you utilise any steam you may get from having a bath or shower in your bathroom by hanging shirts on hangers in there to lightly steam them before ironing (pictured)

4. Use shower steam

For anyone that hates ironing, there's a simple way you can get around this.

'I use shower steam as a natural de-creaser, to cut down the time spent on ironing,' Mila said. 

Finally, Mila recommends you fold your clothes while they are warm, because they crinkle and wrinkle as they cool down (pictured)

Mila is known for sharing an array of tips and tricks to make home life easier, including how to clean your microwave in just four minutes.

Mila said all you need is one cup of water and one teaspoon of washing detergent.

Then mix them together inside a jug and put it inside the microwave for four minutes. 

Once you take the jug out of your microwave, you should simply wipe down the inside and door with a clean cloth.
