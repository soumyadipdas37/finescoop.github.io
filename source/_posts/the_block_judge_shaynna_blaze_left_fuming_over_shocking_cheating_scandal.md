The Block contestants Luke and Jasmin won the challenge on Sunday night's episode with their 1910-themed children's room and en-suite.

And despite giving the couple the perfect score of ten, judge Shaynna Blaze has now admitted that she had a nagging feeling that the design of their bedroom was one she had seen elsewhere.

Speaking to TV WEEK, the 57-year-old explained: 'I thought, "I'm just going to have a look" – and I found an identical one. There are one or two teeny-tiny tweaks, but it's literally a carbon copy!' 

'It was a carbon copy!' Despite giving Luke and Jasmin the perfect score of ten, judge Shaynna Blaze has now admitted that she had a nagging feeling that the design of their bedroom was one she had seen elsewhere

Sunday's episode of the home renovation show saw Luke and Jasmin praised for constructing a children's play area above the bed, as well as the mustard and timber tones in the bathroom.

And while she couldn't quite put her finger on it at the time, Shaynna has now explained that the pair's room is a 'carbon copy' of another image she found through a simple internet search.

The interior designer fumed: "We're not into copy-and-pasting. And not only that, it takes months and expertise to put all that together – the research, actually finding all those pieces.

'When you present it in a competition and say, "I put this together", it's like, "Well, no you haven't! You just copied somebody else's hard work and claimed it as your own."'

Not happy: However, Shaynna, has now accused the pair of cheating, explaining: 'I thought, "I'm just going to have a look" – and I found an identical one. There are one or two teeny-tiny tweaks, but it's literally a carbon copy!'

Jasmin, 36, was quick to deny the cheating claims, telling the publication that the design of the room was a product of a moodboard she had created.

She also claimed that if she were to cheat, she 'wouldn't have done it so openly'.

The episode saw Luke and Jasmin winning the room reveal with 30 points, followed by a tie on 29 with Sarah and George, and Jimmy and Tam.

Daniel and Jade placed third on 25-and-a-half points and Harry and Tash on 23-and-a-half.

This isn't the first cheating scandal to rock The Block this season, as contestant Harry was recently accused of sneaking into the building site when the contestants were supposed to be at home during the COVID-19 lockdown.

The 57-year-old, who is competing on the show with his daughter Natasha, admitted to snooping around on set to 'take some measurements'.

While the interstate couples were back home, Harry was within walking distance of the construction site in Brighton - and his decision to discreetly work on his reno has sparked a cheating scandal.
