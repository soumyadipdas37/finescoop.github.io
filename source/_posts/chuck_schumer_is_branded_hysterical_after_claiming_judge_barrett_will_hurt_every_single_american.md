Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been mocked for delivering a melodramatic speech following President Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. 

The Democrat was accused of 'fear-mongering' and being 'hysterical' as he held an impromptu press conference on Saturday night in which he proclaimed that Barrett's confirmation would 'hurt every single American'.

In his hyperbolic address, Schumer attacked Barrett by claiming she 'stands against' 'just about everything America believes and stands for.'

'Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg must be turning over in her grave up in heaven,' he howled. 

Several poked fun at the Senator for that line, with one stating: 'RBG hasn't even b been buried yet...'

Barrett has repeatedly emphasized that she is an impartial judge, but some liberals worry that her 'originalist' interpretation of the Constitution means she often comes to decision that jibe more with conservative policies and viewpoints. 

On Saturday night, Schumer began his attack on Barrett by claiming she would dismantle the Affordable Care Act if she were confirmed before November 10, when the issue is set to come before the Court.  

'A vote for Amy Coney Barrett is a dagger aimed at the heart of the healthcare protections Americans so desperately need and want,' Schumer raged to an assembled crowd of cameras. 

 He then went on to claim that Barrett would attempt to topple women's reproductive rights. 

'Her record also makes clear that women's reproductive right will be at risk, Roe V Wade will be at risk. If she's on the court I believe it will be eliminated or so greatly constricted that in effect its eliminated.'

Schumer subsequently claimed that 'labor rights would be eliminated' and 'all efforts to stop global warming would be hurt'.   

He continued: 'LGBTQ rights would also be hurt. This hit home personally for me, because at our Jewish New Year's dinner we heard that Justice Ginsburg had died  My daughter who was sitting next to her wife whispered "Will our right to marry be constrained under this new court?"'

Many accused Schumer of making up that story, with one channeling a Jeopardy contestant by stating: 'I'll take Things That Never Happened for $500, Alex'. 

Another stated: 'Chuck, seriously, I'm Jewish, my sister is married to a woman, and the idea that this Justice is going to overturn that is just hysterical. Judges don't just make decrees. They decide cases brought before them. Please please stop saying stupid asinine things.'

Lawyer David Limbaugh also similarly criticized Schumer for his overwrought reaction to Barrett's nomination. 

'Chuck Schumer launches into scaremongering, saying Judge Barrett threatens our health care. Only a leftist could say that. She won’t legislate from the bench. She’ll adjudicate Obamacare challenges on the basis of the Constitution and statutory construction, unlike leftist judges.'

Conservative commentator Mark Simone also chimed in: 'Always count on tasteless, crude, awkward Chuck Schumer to spew out his partisan hatred and hysterical hyperbole even at the first second of her nomination.'

Even supporters of Schumer appeared less than impressed by his dramatic display, saying he came up with no actual solutions as to how to stop Barrett's nomination from occurring. 

'OK. So what's the plan, Chuck? How will you prevent this?' they asked.
