They've spent the summer exploring some of Europe's most picturesque locations.  

And, Ed Westwick's girlfriend Tamara Francesconi, 23, posed in a black bandeau bikini after 'eating her body weight in seafood' during their Santorini break, on Tuesday.

The model took to Instagram to share snaps and videos from her day of adventures with the Gossip Girl star, 33, which saw them go off-roading in a buggy.   

Wow! Ed Westwick's girlfriend Tamara Francesconi, 23, posed in a black bandeau bikini after 'eating her body weight in seafood' during their Santorini break, on Tuesday

Tamara looked sensational in her two-piece swimwear set, which featured wooden circles, which held it together.

She layered up with a semi-sheer green beach shirt and held onto a Christian Dore handbag, while wearing a black bucket hat to complete her ensemble.

She captioned her upload: 'Today was the best, ate my body weight in seafood, went off roading in our buggy and got stuck, found a secluded beach to cool off and took the world's greatest nap!'

All the seafood! Tamara also shared a snap of their impressive seaside lunch

Their Santorini getaway comes after Ed was seen joking around with his girlfriend as he pretended to propose while they spent the day together in Lake Como on Friday.

The Gossip Girl star was seen getting down on one knee while he and the model waited for his mum to join them, but Tamara was none too pleased by the act. 

Tamara looked at Ed with a displeased expression as he held his hands to her as if he was holding a ring, before he stood up and expressed his disappointment at being rebuffed by her.

But he proved that all was well between them as he quickly gave her a kiss as an apology for making the joke.

Ed went public with Tamara during a Los Angeles outing in October, after insiders claimed the couple had been dating for weeks.

A source told The Sun that Tamara is a hit with Ed's close-knit family: 'Tamara's head over heels with him and Ed is proud to tell everyone Tamara is his girlfriend,' the insider claimed.

'His friends and family all approve and think they're a great match.'

Tamara - who boasts 206k Instagram followers - has been keeping her fans up to date with her recent travels, posting smouldering shots and cosy selfies with Ed.
