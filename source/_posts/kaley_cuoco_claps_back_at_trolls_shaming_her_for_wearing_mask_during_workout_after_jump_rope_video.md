Kaley Cuoco has recently returned to work on her upcoming drama series The Flight Attendant, as Hollywood gets back to business amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

But the California-born actress had to undergo a two-week quarantine before returning to set, and she's continuing to take precautions.

She recently clapped back at some trolls, who were shaming her for wearing a face mask during her workout, after she posted a video of herself jumping rope.

Clapping back: Kaley Cuoco recently clapped back at some trolls, who were shaming her for wearing a face mask during her workout, after she posted a video of herself jumping rope

The 34-year-old shared the clip Monday, captioned: 'Jump It Out. My newest obsession during COVID/quarantine! All you need is 20 mins , a jump rope, and good music !'

She showed off her taut physique in a black sports bra, blue shorts and white trainers, with a blue surgical mask.

'You’re wearing a mask because why?' one follower asked, as another commented: 'Don’t use mask to exercise. CO2 Nice going.'   

Cuoco later commented: 'For everyone and their mask comments. I wear a mask when I’m in an enclosed space around others, which I was. I’m protecting myself and everyone around me. That’s why I choose to wear a mask. Thanks for playing.'

Anti-maskers: 'You’re wearing a mask because why?' one follower asked, as another commented: 'Don’t use mask to exercise. CO2 Nice going'

In her defense: As she appeared to be keeping with CDC guidelines, Kaley later defended herself in a comment

She also received some support from followers, one person writing: 'Best exercise ever!! And well done for doing it with a mask on! Being a great example.'

Another wrote: 'Wearing a mask is not dangerous if you listen to your body. Kaley will likely feel a lot fitter after exercising like this once she can train without wearing a mask. It’s like athletes doing altitude training. She is being a responsible citizen, it’s a shame more people can’t be!!' 

The CDC guidelines on the topic state: 'People who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a mask if it causes difficulty breathing. 

'If unable to wear a mask, consider conducting the activity in a location with greater ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors) and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.'

Kaley has recently returned to work on her HBO Max series The Flight Attendant, sharing some behind-the-scenes masked selfies last week with costar Michiel Huisman.

She captioned the photos: 'We’re back!! Keeping our distance of course! ...Time to land this [airplane emoji]!'

The suspenseful drama series went on hiatus back in March, as the COVID-19 lockdown forced Hollywood to temporarily shut down.

Production previously wrapped on all international locations, with about three episodes left to shoot, which will all film in New York City.

Co-worker goals: She also shared another masked-up selfie over the holiday weekend with costar Zosia Mamet

Kaley executive produces and stars as Cassie, a flight attendant who wakes up in a strange place with a dead man in her bed and no recollection of what happened.

She also shared a masked-up selfie over the weekend with costar Zosia Mamet, writing: 'Friends that get covid tested every few days , wear masks, take necessary pre-cautions, listen to production rules , wash hands all day long and respect the process together, get to act together @zosiamamet 

'This picture was taken right before we shot today’s scene in a very structured quarantined environment. Very proud of our cast and crew at #theflightattendant and everyone @warnerbrostv & @hbomax for making this possible for us!'

The 8 Simple Rules actress revealed last month on Instagram that she was returning to work on her new show.

She said in a video: 'The first update would be that I am going back to work! So my sister, me and my trusty assistant Emma go back to New York on Monday. And we have to quarantine – I'm sure you'll see a lot of stuff on social media about our quarantine.

'We'll be quarantined for two weeks and you'll get a look at our shenanigans, I'm sure. And then back to work. We only have like two and a half episodes left, so I'm going to wrap up by the beginning of October.'

The show, which is expected to premiere in November, is based on the 2018 novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian.

Kaley continued: 'I don't have an exact date but that is exciting at all in itself. I don't know if you guys know this but I have been working on this project for three years. 

'It goes back to three years from when I actually found the original book, so it's very exciting for me, and then obviously developing it for over two years.'
