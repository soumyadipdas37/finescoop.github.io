Nickayla said she didn't care about appearances amid the tragic time in the family, less than three months after Naya's body was recovered July 13 in Lake Piru, California.

'Im not concerned with the ways things look because no one can see each agonizing moment we all endure,' Nickayla said of her sister's tragic passing, as officials ruled Naya's death at 33 an accidental drowning after she embarked on a July 8 boat ride with Josey.

Nickayla said that 'what matters most I've learned, is to show compassion, not to judge others and never take a moment for granted,' adding, 'I hope you all can do the same.'

Nickayla has past spoken publicly about her deep grief in the wake of her sister's premature death. 

Nickayla is pictured in a previous Instagram post with Naya, who is eight years her senior. Naya and Ryan welcomed their son Josey in 2015 and divorced in 2018  

 The pair were seen holding hands as they shopped in a local Target store and went down the escalator on September 19

They have been inseparable since 33-year-old Naya drowned while boating with her five-year-old son Josey on California's Lake Piru and were spotted together multiple times this month 

'Sister,⁣ ⁣There are no words to describe my love for you,' she said on Instagram July 25. 'Side by side or miles apart, our connection is infinite. Our bond is unbreakable. We were complete opposites, yet simultaneously the same. The yin to my yang. I never knew that by losing you, I would find so much of you in myself.'

She continued, 'I've never known a life without you in it & still can't imagine it. My world is turned upside down. But through it all, everything we were, we are still. I'll always look at you with the same eyes as I did when I was young. My shmaya, I'll love you for eternity & miss you every second of my life.'

Ryan and Nickayla have moved into a three-bedroom rented house together where they are caring for Josey, who turned five last week, with the help of Dorsey's parents.

The pair are spending every spare minute of their time together, as seen in exclusive DailyMail.com photos. 

Both Ryan and Nickayla, a stunning 5ft 11in fashion model and social influencer who bears a striking resemblance to her actress sister, posted emotional tributes to Naya on social media after her shocking death. Since the tragedy, they have been leaning heavily on each other for support and comfort.
