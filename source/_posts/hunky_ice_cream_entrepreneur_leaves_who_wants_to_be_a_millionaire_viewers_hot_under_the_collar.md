Viewers of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? were left gushing over a hunky  contestant who appeared on the programme last night.

Scott Burgess, 25, from Devon,  was the third contestant to appear on the hit ITV show yesterday and quickly sailed through to the £64,000 question with three lifelines remaining.

But viewers appeared distracted by the ice cream entrepreneur's good looks, with one person commented: 'This Scott guys Instagram is going to be blowing up tonight all those thirsty gays and housewives.'

Meanwhile others speculated that Scott, who will return to the show tonight, is the mystery contestant who producers have teased will secure themselves the top prize of £1,000,000 this week.

The businessman went on to ask host Jeremy Clarkson for his help, with the presenter admitting it was the earliest he'd ever been asked.

Despite Scott saying he had never heard of the word before, Jeremy assured him it was a type of flooring, helping Scott secure £2,000.  

Scott stunned Jeremy by revealing in his younger years he had lived in Beijing in order to learn Mandarin, while he also said he was an accomplished drummer. 

Scott impressed Jeremy by quickly whizzing through the first ten questions on the programme last night 

He also revealed he had won an award at school and deemed 'Most Likely To Make £1,000,000.' 

He quickly raced through several other questions and quickly reached the £32,000 total.

But he turned down the option to set his safety net at each total, and insisted he was planning to keep the option for later in the game.

His time in the chair ran out just as he reached the £64,000 question, with the heart throb set to return to screens tonight. 

The 25-year-old appeared relaxed on the programme as he raced to the £64,000 question using just one of his lifelines 

Many viewers took to Twitter to gush over the contestant, with one commenting: 'Scott has really nice cheekbones. Just an observation.'

Another added: 'Wow Scott is only 25 and he has had a brilliant life by doing a lot of achievements.'

'Sorry Scott I didn't mean to call you a tit,' a third commented. 'You are a beautiful man.' 

Scott's performance comes amid a week in which producers have teased Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? viewers will see a UK contestant win the jackpot.

It is unknown if Scott, who will return to the programme tonight, is the mystery contestant who bags themselves the £1,000,000 jackpot 

The currently unnamed contestant answered all 15 questions correctly to become the show's sixth champion and the first in 14 years.
