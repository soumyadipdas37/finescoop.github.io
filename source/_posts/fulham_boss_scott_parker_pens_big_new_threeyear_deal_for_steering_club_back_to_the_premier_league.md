Former England midfielder Scott Parker has signed a new three-year deal as Fulham manager after leading the club back to the Premier League.

Parker, 39, won promotion from the Championship at the first try and said: ‘I’m delighted to have signed a new deal which shows mutual faith and commitment, on both my side and the club’s. 

'There’s a lot of hard work ahead, and we’ll be striving to improve and progress every day.’

Parker was named Fulham caretaker manager in February 2019 following the departure of Claudio Ranieri and was appointed on a permanent basis three months later.

In his first full season in charge, Parker led Fulham to an immediate return to the top-flight after they beat Brentford 2-1 in the Championship playoff final. 

Parker this week added to his squad by bringing in Southampton midfielder Mario Lemina on a season-long loan deal.

His Fulham side kick-start their Premier League campaign against Arsenal at Craven Cottage on September 12.
