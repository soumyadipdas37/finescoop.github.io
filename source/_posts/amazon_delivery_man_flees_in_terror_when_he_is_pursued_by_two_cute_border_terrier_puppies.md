An Amazon delivery man was chased down a garden path and out the gate- by two adorable Border Terrier puppies. 

Dog-owner Katy Ringsdore, 36, from Devon ordered a candle from Amazon during lockdown which arrived around 11am on April 14.  

The delivery driver rang the doorbell, activating the front door security camera, and alerting the two puppies to the presence of a stranger.
