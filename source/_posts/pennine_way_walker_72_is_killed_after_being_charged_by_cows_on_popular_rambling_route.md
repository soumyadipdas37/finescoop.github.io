A walker has been killed after he was charged by a herd of cows on the popular Pennine Way rambling route as police called for witnesses to come forward. 

Malcolm Flynn, 72, from Carlisle, was fatally injured in what police said was a 'tragic incident' while he was walking on land near Thirlwall Castle and Gisland, Northumberland, at around 11.45am on Friday, September 11.

Police said he died at the location, which is on the Pennine Way.

Detective Chief Inspector Jane Fairlamb said: 'My thoughts are with Malcom's family and friends at this time as they come to terms with the loss of a loved one in what was a shocking and tragic incident.

'Our investigation is very much ongoing and we have already spoken to a number of witnesses, however, we are still trying to trace a number of people who were in the area at the time who we haven't yet spoken to, and think could greatly assist our enquiries.'

Mr Flynn, who was walking with a companion, was wearing glasses and a sunhat, a T-shirt covered by a fleece, and had a telescopic stick.

Officers are interested in hearing from anyone who was in the area around the time of the incident, particularly:

Anyone with information is asked to call 101.
