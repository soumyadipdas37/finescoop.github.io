She's been juggling work with being a mother to her two children, Theodore, two, and her newborn daughter Gigi, six weeks.

And Vogue Williams proved there's no rest for the wicked as she left Global Studios following her weekend show on Heart FM in central London on Sunday.

The presenter, 34, turned heads as she slipped into a tiny broderie dress, which highlighted her enviable legs.

Fashionista Vogue amped up the glamour by teaming her ensemble with a bright pink cardigan, which she complemented with a white waist-belt.

The media personality maintained her vibrant display when it came to her footwear and accessories as she boosted her frame in bright heels and a matching tote bag.

Shielding her eyes from the sun in circular shades, the blonde rounded things off with dainty earrings.

Vogue recently hit back at trolls after she was body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss, six weeks after giving birth to her daughter Gigi.

The broadcaster garnered much adulation when she shared a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini for a tan tutorial on Instagram.

However, the TV star returned to the image-sharing platform to reveal she had also been subject to some 'awful' comments for appearance.

The Irish beauty wrote: 'There is no secret! I got a lot of comments and mails about the video I posted the other day. Mainly positive but my god there were some awful ones!

'I hate the term "snapping back" it’s not something I aspire to do after having a child nor do I think it’s important. My body is different to other people’s, I didn’t do anything specific.

'I’ve only recently started training again, 4 times a week for 45 minutes a session. I try to eat healthily but I have not cut calories and eat a lot more than usual as I’m breastfeeding and it’s important to keep calories up so you have a good milk supply.

'I trained the whole way throughout my pregnancy and I think that is a factor in the way I look now. I’m also VERY tall so there’s a lot more room for a baby.' 

Revealing that she's been a fitness devotee for almost half her life, she continued: 'I’ve trained since I was 16, for me it’s a great thing not only for my body but for my mind too.

'At the moment I feel permanently exhausted but training gives me energy and keeps my hormones under more control (they are still all over the place a little as with any new mother).'
