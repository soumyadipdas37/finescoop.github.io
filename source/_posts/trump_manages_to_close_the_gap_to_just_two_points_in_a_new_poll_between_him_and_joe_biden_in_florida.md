A new poll suggests the race for the White House between Democratic nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump is getting closer in the battleground state of Florida with just a 2 point gap between the two candidates.

Biden has the edge of Trump, 48 percent to 46 percent according to a new poll by CBS News that was published on Sunday. 

The survey, conducted earlier this month between September 15 and 18th asked 1,200 voters who they would be voting for.

Trump narrowly won Florida by just over 100,000 votes in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and will almost certainly need it this time around too 

The poll's 3.7 percent margin of error still sees Biden taking the lead in the Sunshine State.

Some 5 per cent of voters also say they are still 'not sure' whom they wish to vote for.

Although Biden is still out in front, his lead appears to have been diminished somewhat after a poll in July showed him to be 6 points in front.   

In terms of demographics, Trump is leading among white people likely to vote in Florida with 59 percent suggesting they will vote for the president.

However, Biden appears to have a lead among Hispanic voters, by a similar margin -  56 percent compared to Trump's 36 percent.

Trump narrowly carried the state in 2016 49% to Hillary Clinton who secured 47%. 

The state is just as likely to be just as crucial this time around if the Democrats are to be successful at voting Trump out of office.  

The economy appears to be one of the most important issues for voters with many of those surveyed believing Trump's policies to be aiding a recovery with potential voters saying they feel the president's economic policies would better help their family's financial situation than Biden's proposals.   

Also, despite coronavirus cases still rising, Florida voters appear to feel more positive about efforts to combat the virus than efforts earlier in the summer although largely among party lines.
