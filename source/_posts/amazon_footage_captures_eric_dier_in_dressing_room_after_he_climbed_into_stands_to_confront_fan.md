Amazon's series on Tottenham's 2019-20 season reveals never-before-seen footage of Eric Dier in the aftermath of his incredible spat with a Spurs fan after their FA Cup fifth round defeat on penalties by Norwich in March.

Dier shocked the football world as he was filmed climbing over seats to try and get to a fan who was shouting abuse at him in front of Dier's family.

The Spurs and England defender was later banned for four matches for the incident, though manager Jose Mourinho defended his actions.

In episode seven fo All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur, Spurs goalkeeper tells Dier in the dressing room after the match: 'Eric, your brother is here'

Erik Lamela then asks Dier: 'What happened?'

Dier tells Lamela as more team-mate walk in: 'I was looking for my brother in the stands and there was a guy a couple of rows in front of my brother and he was going like this (swears and mouths f*** you, shit).

'Two rows below my brother, that's where my mother sits, that's where my sister sits, everyone's family sits and our parents have to stand there and have someone two rows in front of you call you a c*** and a f****** son of a b**** and a p**** and a s*** and this and think it's OK?'

Mourinho said after the match: 'I think Eric Dier did something that we professionals cannot do, but in these circumstances I think every one of us would do.'
