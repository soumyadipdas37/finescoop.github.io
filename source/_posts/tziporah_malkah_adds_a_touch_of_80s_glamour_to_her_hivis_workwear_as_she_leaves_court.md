She's the former model who is no stranger to controversy. 

And Tziporah Malkah proved she's also busy woman on the go when she attended Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on Monday. 

The 46-year-old exited the court in crisp white workwear, with it appearing she had just finished a night shift. 

Whoops! Former model Tziporah Malkah, 46, (pictured) offered a glimpse of her black lace bra as she left Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on Monday

The former I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! star wore her workwear with reflective stripes slightly unbuttoned, offering a glimpse of her black lace bra, as she walked down the courthouse steps.

She accessorised her blinding hi-vis look with a pair of spectacles, black work boots and added a touch of '80s glamour with fingerless lace gloves, reminiscent of Madonna's Like A Virgin years. 

The statuesque brunette carried her belongings in a large black handbag, slung over her shoulder.

Tziporah preferred to keep things simple on the day, wearing minimal makeup.

She happily added a bit of va-va-voom with her brunette tresses tied up in a classic  up do. 

She clutched her rose gold iPhone in her hand as she left the courthouse.

Meanwhile, in July it was revealed a bizarre love triangle involving Tziporah and two ex-partners - one a former policeman and the other a female jailbird - is set to play out before the courts.

Last year the 46-year-old was pictured holding hands with Victoria Rupp at Sydney's Bondi Beach.

But after their relationship fizzled, Tziporah began dating former cop Nicholas Patsidis, 40, also a one-time lover of Rupp's.

Police took out one of the orders to protect Malkah from Patsidis after he was charged with assaulting her.

The other AVO is in place to protect Patsidis from Rupp after she was accused of bombarding the ex-cop with abusive text messages following their split.

Tziporah will appear at Downing Centre Local Court again on September 25.
