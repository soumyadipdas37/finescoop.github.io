A great white shark was spotted less than ten feet from the shore in Cape Cod days before another was seen swimming three feet from a mother and her baby.

The predator, estimated to be 10ft long, was photographed swimming in the shallows of Race Point Beach in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on Sunday at around 11am.

Sharks were spotted in Cape Cod once on Monday and twice on Tuesday as the charity warned of great whites hunting near the shore.

Tuesday's second sighting was just 20ft from shore and 'three feet from a woman and baby in the water', according to the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy.

Tamzen McKenzie and her friends saw the shark swimming 'less than ten feet from the shore' on Sunday.

She said she noticed the seals in the area staying out the water as the shark approached. 

Writing on social media, she said: 'It swam back and forth in front of us for about 10 minutes, pretty amazing.'

There were no lifeguards in the area the shark was spotted and she did not have cellphone service, she said. 

Shocking footage shows a shark mere inches from a boat at Race Point Beach in Provincetown, after a great white was spotted just three feet away from a mother in the water with her baby 

Tamzen told WBZ-TV: 'We’ve never seen one that close. It was super interesting.'

It comes after the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy released shocking footage showing a shark swimming a few inches away from a boat in the area. 

In the video shared on Friday, the huge shark slowly swims right alongside the boat as one passenger shouts: 'Oh my god.'

Its left fin nearly touches the hull of the boat as it ominously glides through the water.

One passenger lets out a nervous laugh as another woman again says: 'Oh my god,' before the shark begins to swim away.

The charity is warning people great whites are known to hunt and feed in shallow waters and they will continue to be a presence off many Cape Cod beaches in the coming weeks. 

It said: 'This is a good example and reminder of how close to shore white sharks can get.

'As the fall season approaches, we would like to remind everyone that white sharks are still off of the Cape Cod coastline. 

'Based on tagging data, peak white shark activity is in August, September, and October. Remember to be shark smart.'
