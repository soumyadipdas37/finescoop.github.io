She recently enjoyed a sun-soaked trip to Marbella. 

And Chloe Ferry has certainly been busy since her return to the UK as she revealed she's now preparing to make her Newcastle mansion available to rent. 

The Geordie Shore star, 25, took to Instagram on Monday to update her fans, joking that if anyone was keen for a stay they should 'get their offers in' soon. 

Move on in! Chloe Ferry has revealed that her Newcastle home, which boasts a hot tub and games room, is going to be available to rent

Chloe explained that instead of permanently parting with the spacious abode when she moves to London, she had decided to put it on the market for rent.

She said: 'I have decided that I am going to move out of my house, so it is going to go on the market for rent. If anyone is interested then get your offers in! 

'Just joking, but yeah my house is going on the market for rent… i've just moved into it as well.'

The beauty has regularly treated fans to glimpses inside her stunning house and even created a home account while she was redecorating.

Stylish: The Geordie Shore star's bathroom boasts white marble flooring and grey walls as well as a spacious tub 

Perfect for parties: There is also a games room which has its own bar and art work on the walls

She moved into the space and started adding some fresh decorative touches in February after moving out of the place she shared with her ex Sam Gowland. 

Since then Chloe has turned her house into a stunning pad, adding her own cinema and games room as well as a stylish outdoor space.

The abode boasts a grey and black marble theme with this being seen in the entertainment areas and bathroom.

Moving on: Chloe moved into the large home back in February and is now renting it out while she relocates to London

While the kitchen cupboards are a grey colour, perfectly complementing the white floors throughout the downstairs of Chloe's home. 

Making sure there's space for all her stunning ensembles, Chloe has transformed one room into a dressing area with pink velvet chairs. 

The stylish touches also continue outside as Chloe has had a grey seating area put in which makes the perfect space to rest after a dip in the hot tub. 

And fans might recognise her eye-catching bathroom, which comes complete with a round tub, as Chloe often shares sultry selfies from there.

Little touches: The house also has some eye-catching lighting features in the white hallways 

Speaking about her own space when she first moved in, Chloe said: 'What I really like about the house is it's got a lot of space when you walk in. I like the big rooms.' 

During a series of videos shared to Instagram at the time the blonde beauty walked through the house before it was decorated.

She explained how she was hoping to transform the home into a stylish space and put down new carpets.

It comes after Chloe cried 'tears of happiness' as she thanked her followers for their support during her weight loss journey in an emotional Instagram clip in May.

Despite her transformation, the beautician recently admitted she still doesn't 'feel great' about her figure.

Chloe said the trolls have got 'inside my head' after being inundated with cruel taunts calling her 'fat and ugly every day'.  

The blonde recently enjoyed a trip to Marbella which came after she ignored speculation she had faked a trip to Ibiza and had instead secretly joined her ex Sam Gowland, 25, in Dubai.

It had been reported that the star had back together with her co-star ex - despite being in the throes of filming Celebs Go Dating. 

A source told The Sun the former-couple were said to be 'reconnecting'; but fans also connected the dots.

An insider said: 'Chloe's taking it really slowly and she's keen to keep it quiet as her friends will all be furious after all the drama. It's a chance for them to reconnect.'
