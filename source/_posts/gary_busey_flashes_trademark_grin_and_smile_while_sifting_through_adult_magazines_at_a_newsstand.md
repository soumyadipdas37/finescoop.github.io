Gary Busey garnered the highest praise and acclaim of his career for his Oscar-nominated performance in 1978's The Buddy Holly Story. 

But oftentimes over the years Busey has been more known for his strange and bizarre behavior both onscreen and off.

And on Friday the Texas native, 76, appeared to be in a jovial mood when he was seen browsing through some magazines at a newsstand in his adopted home of Malibu.

Opting for casual comfort in the fashion department, the actor shuffled through various publications before directing his attention on some adult magazines, including the latest Playboy editions.

The Lethal Weapon star wore baggy blue denim jeans, a black t-shirt, black slip-on sneakers and a face covering around his neck amid the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

He also donned a white baseball cap over his stringy blonde hair, while sporting a scruffy beard and mustache, as he continued his search for reading material to take back to his home. 

At one point Busey noticed the photographer and then flashed a big smile before walking off, seemingly headed back to his nearby home.

Busey made his major film debut in 1974 with a supporting role in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot alongside Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. 

Just four year later he would see his career skyrocket following the success of his role as rock legend Buddy Holly.   

His Hollywood resume includes such films as A Star Is Born (1976), Carny (1980), Barbarosa (1982), Lethal Weapon (1987), Predator 2 (1990), Point Break (1991), The Firm (1993), Lost Highway (1997) and Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas (1998).

Along with his memorable performances in film and television, Busey has also been known for his bizarre behavior following his 1988 motorcycle accident that resulted in a major brain injury

He has also guest starred in a slew of television series, and in more recent years has brought his frenetic personality to reality TV in such shows as Dancing with the Stars, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Apprentice.

Busey's sometimes erratic behavior can be attributed, in part, to the 1988 motorcycle accident that resulted in a major brain injury, which changed his personality radically and made it difficult for him to learn lines. 

One of the major changes from the injury was the loss of inhibition, leaving him with almost no ability to censor himself.
