Brielle Biermann set temperatures soaring on Saturday as she flaunted her stunning figure in an eye-catching yellow bikini.

The 23-year-old Don't Be Tardy Star shared the stunning outfit in a series of photos posted to her Instagram.

The reality star also treated her 1.3 million followers to an intimate fashion show as she revealed some of her new looks in her mirror.

The shirred two-piece had a string halter top and square cups that showcased her cleavage, and the matching bottoms featured the same stretchy texture and three straps.

She completed the beach look with a pair of thick tortoiseshell sunglasses.

'spicy know she spicy. wet wet like a pisces♓️,' Brielle captioned the snaps.

She wasn't done with the bikini content yet, so she shared a short video to her Insta Stories of herself in another Amore + Sorvete two-piece, this time the Elba Flamingo Pink top and the pink Sicily bottoms, which also costs $138.

After showing off the top, Brielle turned around to highlight her pert derriere for her fans.

She returned later in the day with a somewhat more modest look featuring a gray tube top that barely contained her bust.

Brielle wore it tucked into a gray–blue corduroy mini skirt with wide pleats and a handy pocket on the front.

Later, she clapped back at her critics with a short video of herself holding a bag of Hawaiian rolls.

'They're making fun of me for posting so many photos of me in the same outfit. This is my response,' she wrote as she gave the camera the finger.

Brielle displayed notably more natural-looking lips in her posts than she had in the past.

In February, she revealed that she had dissolved the fillers in her famously plump lips, and photos throughout quarantine showed off her more natural look.

'I’ve been getting them injected off and on since I was 18. I flew out to LA in June 2015 and wanted them done so badly,' she told People back in February.

Brielle admitted that the numerous injections left her lips looking too big, but the gradual progression made it difficult for her to know when she had gone too far.

'I didn’t realize how big they were,' she said. 'I’d be like, "Oh, I’m going to LA," and they’re like, "Okay, well maybe let’s not inject the top lip. The top looks good. Let’s do the bottom." I was like, "F*** you guys. I’m going to do what I want."'

'I didn’t realize how crazy it looked. I feel looking back, my lips really looked a little crazy,' she added.
