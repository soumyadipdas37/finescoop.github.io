The Plate of Origin finale aired on Seven on Tuesday and absolutely tanked.  

As Mumbrella reports, the final episode was the lowest rating episode of the entire season, no doubt a major blow for the network. 

The publication reports that for the three-hour double episode finale, 349,000 metro viewers tuned in for the first part, while just 335,000 watched the second. 

Sorry boys! Seven's Plate of Origin finale on Tuesday suffered the worst ratings of the entire SEASON - as just 335,000 tuned in to watch Team Greece win $100,000. Pictured are judges (from left to right) Matt Preston, Manu Feildel and Gary Mehigan 

The Block meanwhile won the night, with 807,000 viewers. 

It comes after Plate of Origin drew in 667,000 for the premiere.  

On Tuesday night's three-hour grand final episode of Plate Of Origin, Team Greece emerged victorious.

Cousins Dezi, 41, and Penny, 33, were crowned Plate of Origin champions winning $100,000.

They received a total judges' score of 76/90 after a three-course meal showdown with Team Vietnam's Thanh, 31, and Duncan, 30.

Dezi said of their win: 'We have represented the Australian Greek community and now we've just won Plate of Origin!'

Shocked: Dezi said of their win: 'We have represented the Australian Greek community and now we've just won Plate of Origin!'

'It is mind-blowing. I'm so grateful, this is beyond anything I could have ever dreamed of.'

When asked by judge Matt Preston if Greek cuisine was the best in the world, Penny added: 'Of course it is!' 

Team Greece secured an early lead with their entrée featuring perfectly cooked prawns, while Team Vietnam's Rice Paper Rolls unravelled with undercooked Morton Bay Bug. 

What a slide: It comes after Plate of Origin drew in 667,000 viewers for the premiere
