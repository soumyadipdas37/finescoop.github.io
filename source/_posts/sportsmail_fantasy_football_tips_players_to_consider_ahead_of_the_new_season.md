It all kicks off once again this weekend in the Premier League when newly-promoted Fulham host Arsenal at Craven Cottage on Saturday lunchtime.

Despite there only being a brief break between the end of last season and the beginning of the new one there has been plenty of change with clubs strengthening in the transfer market.

Chelsea have led the way this summer after enjoying a £230million spending spree while the likes of Everton, Newcastle and Co have also kept active in the market.

And as there have been many changes in the Premier League, it means there will be plenty of new scenarios and exciting players to chose from if you're signing up to the ever-popular Fantasy Premier League game.

Ahead of Saturday's eagerly-anticipated start, Sportsmail has given fans the top tips for the upcoming Fantasy Football campaign...

Liverpool's Premier League winning stars are expected to be popular picks in Fantasy Football

BARGAIN BUYS

Emiliano Martinez

There is talk Emiliano Martinez could be off to Aston Villa but if Mikel Arteta manages to persuade the Argentine goalkeeper to stay, he could stake his claim as No 1 at Arsenal ahead of Bernd Leno.

And he comes in at just £4.5million on Fantasy Premier League - which is a bargain when you consider his form at the end of last season while playing an integral role during the FA Cup and Community Shield triumph.

Arsenal have started to look more compact in defence under Arteta so there is still plenty of work to do. Therefore, he may not always get you points for clean sheets.

Mason Greenwood

The Manchester United youngster has taken the Premier League by storm when given his chance to shine for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side - playing a key role in helping the club secure a top-four finish last term. 

The England striker netted 10 times last season for the Red Devils and he certainly doesn't let the big stage get the better of him.

He will only get more chances next season at Old Trafford and if he continues in the same form, he is definitely worth considering for your team. Greenwood - down as a midfielder on the game - is available for £7.5m.

Mason Greenwood had a breakthrough season last year and could rack up a lot goals

Allan Saint-Maximin

It was sometimes a dull affair at St James' Park last season but if there was one man who would occasionally light the stadium up - it was Allan Saint-Maximin.

The Newcastle winger may have only pocketed three goals and five assists in 1,860 minutes in his debut Premier League season, but he certainly has the magic to hurt defences. 

And surely the £5.5m will only get better next season with more experience under his belt. He is a key player for Newcastle boss Bruce and he could soon be a key player for you too.

Rodrigo

It was some coup for Leeds to acquire the services of Spanish striker Rodrigo for £35million from Valencia ahead of their Premier League assault.

Rodrigo will get plenty of opportunities to lead the line next season for Marcelo Bielsa's newly-promoted Leeds side and you wouldn't put it past him to enjoy a strong debut campaign in England.

Strikers are arguably the hardest players to choose from in Fantasy Football but at a price of just £6m, Rodrigo is surely worth a punt.

BIG-HITTERS TO GET IN YOUR TEAM 

Sadio Mane

Sadio Mane was arguably Liverpool's most deadly attacker last term ahead of Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino as Jurgen Klopp's side coasted towards their first-ever Premier League title.

The 28-year-old, who you would have to fork out £12m on, scored 18 goals and supplied nine assists for the Reds last term and you can expect more of the same this time out - with Liverpool beginning their season at home to Leeds.

Klopp may have endured a difficult summer in the transfer market, but he will still be able to depend on Mane, Salah and Firmino to provide the goods up front.

Bruno Fernandes 

Since arriving from Sporting Lisbon last January in a £68million deal, Fernandes certainly didn't look back - playing a vital role in guiding Manchester United to a third-placed finish in the Premier League.

The Portuguese midfielder scored eight goals and produced seven assists for his United team-mates last term, and he will surely kick on with more experience to his name.

With the likes of Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek and Greenwood around him, he should have plenty of success at Old Trafford going forward.

Harry Kane

It wasn't the easiest of seasons for the Tottenham striker last term during a turbulent season for the club, which saw Mauricio Pochettino sacked before Jose Mourinho took over the reins.

England international Kane was kept out for a large chunk of last season with a hamstring injury but he still managed to score 18 goals - just five worse off than top scorer Jamie Vardy. 

With pre-season under his belt, Mourinho will be counting on the Tottenham talisman to fire Spurs to success in his first full season in charge of the club. 

Harry Kane is hoping for a season where he stays fit after a turbulent season last campaign

Trent Alexander-Arnold 

It was a dream season for the Liverpool-born youngster as he played a huge part in bringing the top-flight trophy back to his city.

The newly crowned PFA Young Player of the Year was Liverpool's main attacking outlet behind the front three, providing 13 assists which is the most for a defender in Premier League history. 

At £7.5m, he is the most expensive defender in the game, but playing in a very reliable Liverpool defence and with the amount of goals he creates, the young England star is a safe bet for any fantasy team.     

RISKY BUYS 

Timo Werner 

Andriy Shevchenko, Gonzalo Higuain, Alvaro Morata, Mateja Kezman and Adrian Mutu - all big-name strikers who joined Chelsea and struggled to adapt in the Premier League after banging in the goals before their moves.

Should Timo Werner walk into the Chelsea team and carry over his fantastic goal-scoring record from RB Leipzig, he will be an immediate success. 

However at £9.5m, the 24-year-old German is a gamble as it's not certain how quick he will adapt to life in the Premier League. 

Chelsea fans will hope that Timo Werner comes to grips with the Premier League very quickly 

James Rodriguez 

The 29-year-old Colombian was once the hottest property in world football after winning the Golden Boot at the 2014 World Cup.

However since then he struggled to adapt to life at Real Madrid and Bayern Munich decided not to extend his loan last season which would have seen him hang around for their Champions League success. 

The cause for concern would be his ability to adapt to arguably the world's most intense league after struggling to meet the high expectations placed upon him six years ago.

Mason Mount

The 21-year-old had a fantastic breakthrough season at Chelsea last campaign, scoring eight goals in 53 appearances.

But Mount like Chelsea's other young stars now have to contend with some of the world's most exciting talents who have been purchased over the summer.

Mount will get game-time, but if £89m signing Kai Havertz shines at Stamford Bridge, he could end up facing more games coming off the bench.   

Mason Mount will have more competition as he looks to build on an impressive season

Dele Alli 

It doesn't feel too long ago that Alli would have been one of the more popular selections by those who play Fantasy Football.

However for the past two seasons his stock has gone down following inconsistent performances which has led to him being left out of the England squad. 

The 24-year-old improved last season following the appointment of Mourinho, but Alli's form needs to match the consistency of two seasons ago.

Most-picked players 

Kevin De Bruyne 

The Belgium superstar is expensive but you are guaranteed big points most weeks when De Bruyne - fresh off winning PFA Player of the Year after an incredible campaign - lines up in your team.

With the star-studded attack in front of him, he will once again excel in the heart of midfield for Pep Guardiola's free-flowing Manchester City side.

De Bruyne, who is available for £11.5m, scored 13 times last season and produced 20 assists - equalling Arsenal legend Thierry Henry's record set during the 2002-03 campaign.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang

The Arsenal striker has been one of the most consistent finishers since stepping into the Premier League, scoring 22 goals in each of the past two seasons.

With an ever-improving Arsenal side under Mikel Arteta, Aubameyang could end up scoring even more goals in the upcoming season.

The Fantasy Premier League website interestingly has the Gabon striker listed as a midfielder in the game this season, but this is even better news for those that select him.

As now he will now get five points per goal, rather than just the four.

Virgil Van Dijk

It's no shock that Virgil van Dijk is one of the best performing defenders in Fantasy Premier League.

In fact Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson and Van Dijk all finished in the top three for defenders in the game for overall points last season.

Van Dijk's impact on the Liverpool team is clearly immense and with him and goalkeeper Alisson it is expected they will keep many clean sheets again this season. 

Adama Traore 

The explosive Wolves winger is one of the more popular players on Fantasy Football, at a bargain of £6.5m.

Traore was giving defences up and down the country nightmares last season thanks to his electric pace and brute strength.

The 24-year-old has improved year-on-year at Wolves and an injury free season could see the Spaniard reach even greater heights this season. 

Adama Traore's low price has made him a popular signing for many fantasy football teams
