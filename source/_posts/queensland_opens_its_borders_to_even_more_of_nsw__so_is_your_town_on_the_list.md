Queensland has opened to about 150,000 more NSW residents after the Sunshine State's border bubble shifted 100 kilometres further south.

From Thursday residents in the Byron Shire, Ballina, the city of Lismore, Richmond Valley including Casino and Evans Head, Glen Innes and 41 other NSW postcodes will be added to the Queensland-NSW border bubble.

Queensland residents are also now able to visit far northern NSW without quarantining for 14 days.  

For months people from NSW coming to Queensland from outside the old border bubble were required to quarantine at their own expense.

Queensland Police Chief Superintendent Mark Wheeler said drivers should expect delays crossing over following 15 variations to the state's border rules since the start of the pandemic.

'We will see some line-ups that will extend probably hundreds of metres down the road,' Superintendent Wheeler told The Today Show.

'At the moment we are seeing delays up to about 30 minutes and that is understandable.

'This is our 15th iteration of border restriction changes, so the public are used to it.'

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is adamant that all border restrictions should be removed but Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says that won't happen until NSW has 28 days without a case of locally acquired COVID-19.

NSW has now gone five consecutive days without community transmission.

Meanwhile, Ms Berejiklian is under pressure to ease restrictions in regional NSW areas - some of which have gone months without a coronavirus case - as the state's streak of no community transmission continues.
