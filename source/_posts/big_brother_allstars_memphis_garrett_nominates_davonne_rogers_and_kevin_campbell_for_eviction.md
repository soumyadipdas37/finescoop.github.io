Da'Vonnne Rogers and Kevin Campbell were nominated for eviction by new Head of Household Robert 'Memphis' Garrett on Sunday's episode of Big Brother All-Stars.

The season 22 episode opened on Day 44 of the houseguests living sequestered with the Head of Household competition underway to replace Daniele 'Dani' Donato, 33.

The competition required building a fire hydrant puzzle and was won by Memphis, 37, who looked to solidify his endgame with 10 contestants remaining on the CBS reality show with a grand prize of $500,000.

Chopping block: Da'Vonne Rogers was nominated for eviction on Sunday's episode of Big Brother All-Stars

Da'Vonne, 32, believed that David Alexander, 30, betrayed her by voting to evict Ian Terry, 29, after he pledged to cast his vote against Tyler Crispen, 25.

David actually voted to evict Tyler in hopes of getting Dani to break a tie and state her allegiance, but Nicole Franzel, 28, who had been aligned with Ian, voted against him in loyalty to the six-person alliance called The Committee.

Da'Vonne and Kevin both assumed that David had lied to them, while Dani and Nicole teamed up to frame David for a vote that he did not cast.

'David played us,' Da'Vonne complained to Nicole. 'I'm going to kill him.'

Also nominated: Kevin Campbell also was nominated for eviction

Feeling betrayed: Da'Vonne felt betrayed by David Alexander and was convinced that he lied to her

The winner: Memphis won the Head of Household competition by figuring out a fire hydrant puzzle

Nicole agreed with Da'Vonne and told her that she felt 'numb' and planned on just ignoring David.

'I hate lying. I hate pretending like I'm shocked. It's absolutely terrible, but, you know what? I have to stick to it at this point or else I'm even in more trouble. Truth in this house does not set you free, it gets people pissed off,' Nicole said in a confessional.

Da'Vonne in a confessional said that David 'flipped' on them before she was shown hugging Dani.

Not true: 'I hate lying. I hate pretending like I'm shocked. It's absolutely terrible, but, you know what? I have to stick to it at this point or else I'm even in more trouble. Truth in this house does not set you free, it gets people pissed off,' Nicole said in a confessional after lying to Da'Vonne

She told Dani that David was 'stupid' and just made her life twice as hard.

'Idiot. He don't even realize that I was the biggest ally that he had,' Da'Vonne said in a confessional wiping away tears.

David in the kitchen tried talking to Da'Vonne who accused him of flipping, but he denied it.

Hard life: Da'Vonne told Dani Donato that David was 'stupid' and just made her life twice as hard

Biggest ally: 'Idiot. He don't even realize that I was the biggest ally that he had,' Da'Vonne said in a confessional wiping away tears as she ranted about David

'Someone is using us,' David told her.

She refused to believe him even though David swore that he lived up to his handshake with Ian.

'David has been trying to sabotage my game all throughout. That doesn't help us in any way. I've been working so hard this season,' Da'Vonne bawled in a confessional.

Shook hands: David was shown shaking hands with Ian Terry after he promised to vote to evict Tyler Crispen

Da'Vonne rushed to another room and Nicole swore to her that she voted to save Ian.

David then exploded in anger and yelled in frustration.

Dani gloated that her plan was working better than she thought it would.

Getting frustrated: David got frustrated that nobody would believe him and screamed in anger

Good plan: Dani gloated that her plan was working better than she thought it would

David figured out that Nicole was the one who flipped and was working with Dani at his expense.

He told Kevin about his theory, but he was reluctant to believe David giving it a 'five percent chance' of being true.

Rough season: Kevin was put on the chopping block yet again

David talked again to Kevin who said he would speak with Da'Vonne and 'try to soften her up'.

Memphis was looking to eliminate David after putting him on the block in week two and said the only way to make sure is 'backdoor'.

David approached him and Memphis offered him a deal to keep him off the block, if he did not play for the veto.

They shook hands on the deal even though David realized it could be a way for Memphis to backdoor him.

Da'Vonnne and Kevin vowed to win the power of veto, while David said that if he was picked for the veto competition that he would play to win and save a friend.

Big Brother All-Stars will return Wednesday on CBS.
