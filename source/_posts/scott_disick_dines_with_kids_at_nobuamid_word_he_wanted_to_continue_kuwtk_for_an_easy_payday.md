Scott Disick was just seen with his kids in his first family outing since news emerged that Keeping Up With The Kardashians will end in 2021.

The 37-year-old reality star appeared to be keeping a low-profile while he dined with his three kids Mason, ten, Penelope, seven and five-year-old Reign on Friday night.

He opted to take his little ones, who he shares with ex Kourtney Kardashian, to Nobu in Malibu, sporting a tie-dye sweatshirt and light-wash jeans.

As he strode out of the restaurant in a pair of multi-colored sneakers, Disick could be seen with his hands on his eldest's shoulders, who hid his face under a blue blanket.  

The KUWTK fixture underwent a slight outfit change, as he stepped out in a black and white patterned three-quarter button-down. 

His youngest kids were not photographed, when Disick arrived or exited the celeb eatery.

His outing also comes on the heels of a Page Six report that both Disick and Khloe Kardashian were against the show going off the air because they both wanted to keep getting an 'easy payday.' 

Kardashian fans were quite surprised when the family announced they were ending Keeping Up With the Kardashians after its 20th season, which recently started filming and will debut on E! in 2021.

Sources told the outlet that the family was 'divided' into two camps about whether or not to continue the show, with just Disick and Khloe Kardashian wanting to continue.

Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner were in favor of ending the show, after they reportedly realized it wasn't the best 'money-making strategy.'  

The sources added that both Khloe and Disick saw the show as an, 'easy and reliable payday,' though there is no indication on where Disick's ex Kourtney, or her brother Rob felt about continuing the show.

'Some of them needed the money more than others,' a source added, though both Disick and Khloe have rumored net worth of $40 million, so neither are exactly hurting for money.

Still, even the family members who were in favor of ending the show would have likely continued, had there not been a COVID-19 pandemic. 

'If it wasn’t for the pandemic, it could have kept going,' the source said. 'But times are changing, and budgets are lower, and people want to move on.'

Scott first began appearing on the series with his then-partner Kourtney Kardashian in 2007, though they would later separate in 2015.

He also starred in his own E! spin-off Flip It Like Disick which focuses on his house-flipping business, which debuted last year on E!, though it hasn't been renewed for a second season quite yet. 

On Saturday, the doting dad posted a pictures with his youngest child, which showed off the five-year-old's short mohawk. 

Scott simply captioned the photo, 'Covid cuts.'
