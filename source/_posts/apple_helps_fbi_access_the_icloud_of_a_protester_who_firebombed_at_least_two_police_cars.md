Apple has helped the FBI access iCloud information from one of its customers who is suspected of firebombing police cars in Seattle in the days following the death of George Floyd in May. 

In the days following the death of Floyd, who died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protests against police brutality erupted across the US and globally. 

According to the FBI, a masked protester at one of those demonstrations in Seattle allegedly set fire to at least two patrol cars. 

The FBI later received a tip about the identity of the suspect. 

Apple has helped the FBI access iCloud information from one of its customers who is suspected of firebombing police cars in Seattle in the days following the death of George Floyd in May. The FBI received a tip about this masked man at a protest in Seattle on May 30

According to a search warrant obtained by Forbes, Kelly Jackson was arrested last week for allegedly setting fire to at least two police patrol cars on May 30.

As the FBI looked into the tip, agents checked surveillance feeds, social media images and news footage.  

They eventually obtained phone records from Verizon and found that the suspect was using an iPhone 7. 

The FBI then reached out to Apple for help accessing the suspect's iCloud information. 

And though Apple has previously refused to help the government hack into the physical iPhones of a Saudi national who shot dead three people at a naval base in Pensacola, Florida, in December 2019, the company helped the FBI in the case against Jackson. 

Their search through his iCloud returned potential evidence in the form of screenshots that were reportedly hosted in Jackson's photo library.

Jackson has been charged with unlawful possession of a destructive device and arson 

According to Forbes, one screenshot showed an Instagram post promoting the protest, called the 'The Defiant Walk of Resistance Against Injustice.' 

Another image showed a list of 'ingredients' for a Molotov cocktail.

Meanwhile, videos from the account showed a white male’s hands opening a black bag that held a green glass bottle with a gold cap, filled with liquid, according to Forbes. 

A second video showed a similar glass bottle being thrown into the door of a cop car, setting it on fire. 

Jackson has been charged with unlawful possession of a destructive device and arson. 

According to Apple's transparency report, for the second half of 2019, the company received 4,095 requests on Apple user accounts and returned information for 3,645.
