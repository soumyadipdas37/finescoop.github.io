Chelsea have agreed the £26million signing of goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Rennes after finally reaching agreement on a payment structure. 

The 28-year-old had been allowed to undergo part of his medical a week ago after believing a deal was in place only to be called back when they failed to agree on a final fee. 

The deal is understood to be £22m plus add-ons with Mendy signing a five year contract. 

Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Edouard Mendy from Rennes for £26million

Frank Lampard has been looking for a replacement for the much-maligned Kepa Arrizabalaga

Rennes had asked for players on loan in negotiations, notably defender Fikayo Tomori but he is expected to join Everton. 

Mendy said his farewells to teammates on Friday after playing 34 games for the club. 

Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has wanted a new goalkeeper to usurp much-maligned Kepa Arrizabalaga as his No 1. 

Chelsea have spent yet more money on their summer transfer window spending spree

Mendy is set to become the seventh signing in an extraordinary summer of spending for Chelsea, which is set to top £250million. 

Chelsea full-back Davide Zappacosta has finalised his loan to Genoa. The right-back has been at Stamford Bridge since 2017, but went on loan to Roma last season.
