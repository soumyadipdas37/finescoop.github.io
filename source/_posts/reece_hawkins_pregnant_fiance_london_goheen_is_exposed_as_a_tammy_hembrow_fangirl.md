Reece Hawkins and his new fiancée London Goheen delightedly announced they were expecting their first child together on Wednesday.

And London, 22, certainly appears to be living out her fairytale, as unearthed Instagram screenshots show her gushingly liking and commenting on family snaps of her man's ex, Tammy Hembrow, when the pair were still together.

The American beauty was evidently a fan-girl of social media sensation Tammy, 26, as she commented she was 'such a babe' and said she was 'obsessed with the little family' she had with Reece, 25.

American beauty London, who recently moved to the Gold Coast to live with Reece, also shared a lengthy statement on her Instagram story, explaining that she'll be posting about her pregnancy journey on another platform, before linking to her OnlyFans account.

'I'm so excited that I can finally share with y'all the news that I'm PREGNANT!!!' London's post began. 

She said she made the decision to post on OnlyFans because over the years she and Reece have been 'harassed to the point where we've had to seek legal action.'

'We've also been harassed to the point where we've had to seek legal action a few times due to harassment, bullying and stalking over the last year... with that being said I've decided I'm going to share my pregnancy journey on another platform where I feel SAFE and POSITIVE,' she explained.
