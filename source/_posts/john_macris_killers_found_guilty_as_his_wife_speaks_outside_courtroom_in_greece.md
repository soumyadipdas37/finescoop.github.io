The glamorous widow of Sydney underworld figure John Macris uttered just two words as her husband's killer was found guilty of his execution murder in a Greek court.

Macris, 46, was gunned down outside his home in Athens while being ambushed by Bulgarian brothers Yuliyanov J Raychev Serafim and Milen Raychev in October 2018.

An Athens court on Monday found Serafim pulled the trigger, while Milen was an accessory to the murder.

Macris' Playboy model wife Viktoria Karida, 33, simply said 'I'm satisfied' to media outside the courtroom, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Serafim and Milen stalked Macris for 19 days before carrying out the hit outside the couple's up-market home in the seaside suburb of Voula, the court was told.  

Macris was killed while sitting in his car, which was caught on CCTV. 

The brothers were in Greece at the time of the shooting and had rented a Nissan Pulsar and used their own passports to check into a hotel.

The car was seen on CCTV footage passing Macris’ house six times on the days leading up to the shooting. 

They were also seen in the same cafe where Macris had been dining. 

Clothes similar to those in the CCTV footage were later found in Serafim's hotel room.  

Ms Karida previously revealed the pair's two children Achilles and Alexandra had learnt about how their father was killed by watching it on YouTube

At a hearing in July, Ms Karida, who has two kids with Macris, broke down in tears and had to leave the room as the two Bulgarian brothers were led in

Serafim had fled Greece the day after the murder but had returned in April 2019 where he was arrested by police who suspected he was planning another kill.

The 46-year-old's murder was linked to a Canadian branch of the notorious Outlaws motorcycle gang, which Serafim has the logo of tattooed on his left arm.  

Macris left Sydney in 2013 and started afresh in Athens where he ran a security company. 

The brothers' mother said her sons were 'very good gentlemen' and claimed they were wrongly convicted. 

'I'm very sorry about the lady, I'm sorry for her loss, but my kids is not that kind of persons,' she said in English outside court on Monday. 

'My kids is very good gentlemen. I don't believe that they do that kind of thing to kill someone.

'And they have all families and kids. They never can do that kind of things, they have respect for the people.'

At a hearing in July, Ms Karida, who has two kids with Macris, broke down in tears and had to leave the room as the two Bulgarian brothers were led in.

'I am devastated but I remain strong,' Ms Karida told reporters at the time. 

She previously revealed the pair's two children Achilles and Alexandra had learnt about how their father was killed by watching it on YouTube.
