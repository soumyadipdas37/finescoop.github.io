They tied the knot eight years ago in a lavish Mustique ceremony.

And John Cleese, 80, and wife Jennifer Wade, 48, still looked as loved up as ever as they headed out on a shopping spree in London on Thursday.

Strolling hand in hand through the streets, the pair looked smitten as they made their first public outing together since John revealed he'd had a cancer scare in June.

Keeping things casual for the outing, Jennifer opted for a black star print jumper and joggers teamed with trainers. 

Funnyman John also kept things low-key opting for jeans and a polo shirt layered up with a cardigan. 

The pair also ensured they followed the government guidelines as they put on face masks before entering the shops.

John seemed in good health on the outing, following the revelation that had to have a cancerous tumour removed from his leg.

Posting on Twitter back in June, the actor made light of his health scare, insisting 'at my age this sort of thing happens about once a week' and making a classic Monty Python joke about it all.

'Had a minor operation on Friday. A surgeon cut a small cancerous bit out of my leg Very minor,' the star told his 5.7m followers.

This is a reference to the sketch featuring The Black Knight from Monty Python And The Holy Grail.

Luckily, John's operation was a success and he recovered at home with wife Jennifer.

Father-of-two John has been happily married to former model Jennifer since 2012 - but famously had to fork out £25million in divorce settlements across three failed marriages.

He married first wife, American writer and actress Connie Booth, in 1968, and the couple went on to have a child together, daughter Cynthia, 43, three years later.  

Cleese then went on the tie the knot with American actress Barbara Trentham in 1981, with the couple welcoming their daughter Camilla into the world in 1984.

Speaking on Lorraine last year, the star poked fun at his messy love life, quipping: 'Fourth wife, finally got it right! I really recommend it. If you can find a wife you really like…'

The pair divorced in 1990, and the actor left the UK in favour of a move to the bright lights of Los Angeles.

In 1992, he married American psychotherapist, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, but the pair went on to divorce in 2008.
