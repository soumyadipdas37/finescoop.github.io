Gareth Bale would still be the highest paid player at Tottenham even if Real Madrid contribute half of his £500,000-a-week wages.

Spurs are in pole position to bring Wales star Bale back from Real in what could well be the summer's most sensational transfer deal.

And even if Tottenham pay just £250,000-a-week of his salary, he would leapfrog Harry Kane and Tanguy Ndombele in their top earners list.  

Tottenham are confident they can secure Gareth Bale's sensational return from Real Madrid 

The Wales star spent six seasons at Spurs before a world record £86m move to Real in 2013

Bale would move ahead of £200,000-a-week striker Harry Kane as Tottenham's top earner 

Bale's wages would also eclipse those of Tanguy Ndombele, who earns £160,000-a-week

Despite interest in the 31-year-old winger from Premier League rivals Manchester United, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is confident Bale will return to north London. 

As Sportsmail reported on Tuesday, Real Madrid will agree to pay in excess of 50 per cent of Bale's wages in order to facilitate the deal.

Tottenham are believed to have explored the possibility of either a loan or a permanent deal for Bale, who has fallen out of favour with Real manager Zinedine Zidane.

And, as of Tuesday night, the north London club were confident they could land a player they sold for a then world record fee of £85.3million in 2013.

Even with the Spanish giants paying half his wages, Bale would still comfortably be the top earner at Tottenham if the deal happens. 

Daniel Levy is engaged in negotiations with Real and Bale's representatives over his return

Bale has won four Champions League titles at Real but has recently fallen out of favour

Bale's relationship with Real manager Zinedine Zidane has become increasingly frosty

If Gareth Bale returns...

Bale £500,000 (50 per cent paid by Real Madrid)

Kane £200,000

Ndombele £160,000

Son £140,000

Alli £100,000

Lloris £100,000

If Spurs paid half his wages that would eclipse the £200,000-a-week received by star striker Harry Kane. 

Levy ripped up the club's wage structure when England captain Kane signed a six-year contract back in June 2018 with the deal overall worth £62.4m.

French midfielder Tanguy Ndombele is the next biggest earner at the club in £160,000-a-week followed by South Korean forward Son Heung-min on £140,000-a-week.

England international Dele Alli, who could yet be heading to Real as a makeweight in the Bale deal, brings home £100,000-a-week, on par with goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris.

But Bale's salary would blow all of these players out of the water and represent a gamble on a player with a chequered injury history who fell down the pecking order at Real.

However, Bale helped Real win the Champions League four times during his seven seasons with the club and has scored 105 goals in 251 matches.
