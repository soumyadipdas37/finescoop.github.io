Jimmy Kimmel returned in-studio Monday to his late-night talk show after a long summer break and opened up about hosting the virtual Emmy Awards.

The 52-year-old host opened the Los Angeles-based show by joking that it was 'our first show from our studio since March of 2018'.

'I've been at home, working on a COVID vaccine. I'm very close,' Jimmy quipped.

Jimmy pointed out that he was hosting without an audience due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

'We're being very careful. They divided the office into zones. We have zone A, zone B and zone C. I'm not sure if I'm hosting a show or boarding a Southwest Airlines flight,' he continued.

Jimmy said the small crew in the studio was wearing face masks and clear plastic face shields.

'Everyone looks like they're in a Daft Punk cover band,' he said to a few chuckles.

'I need you guys to laugh, even if it's not funny,' Jimmy told the crew.

He then reunited with his sidekick Guillermo Rodriguez, 49, and they ran toward each other in slow-motion style before exchanging a socially distant air hug.

Guillermo congratulated Jimmy for doing a 'wonderful job' hosting the Emmys and then admitted that he watched the Los Angeles Lakers playoffs game and recorded the awards show.

'I hosted the virtual Emmys last night. They're saying it was the highest-rated Emmys ever,' Jimmy said.

'Oh, the lowest?,' he followed with feigned surprise.

'We set a record, let's just say that,' Jimmy added.

Jimmy said it was odd hosting the awards ceremony without any winners around.

'The weirdest part of hosting this year was when it was over, there are usually parties, and everyone is carrying their Emmys around, everyone's happy and celebrating. This year, the show ended, and it was like 'Well, I guess I'll go to my car and drive home'',' he said.

He later added of the 'strange' experience: 'It was probably the first time in history that somebody won an Emmy and 10 minutes later put a load of laundry in the dryer'.

Jimmy also recounted how his Emmy Awards opening used audience reactions from old monologues before 'we pulled the curtain back and revealed there was no one there'.

He said while it was happening that they fooled a lot of people who vented their anger on social media.

'@Jiommykimmel wtf?! It may be that the presenters aren't live but so far it looks like the audience is. What the hell is going on with you Kimmel? No social distancing? No masks? You're as guilty as trump now for fomenting death. A pox on you and goodbye forever. Stupid f***,' read one tweet.

Another tweet wondered if 'Hollywood's special people' were immune to COVID-19 and another declared 'the Hollywood elitists think rules don't apply to them'.

'Sorry to have caused any consternation,' Jimmy said.

Jimmy announced in June during a broadcast of his late-night talk show that he was taking a summer break to spend more time with his family.

The show aired re-runs for two weeks before a stream of celebrities stood in as guest hosts.

The show's guest hosts included: Kerry Washington, Dua Lipa, Rob Lowe, David Spade, John Legend, Nikki Glaser, Sean Hayes, Joel McHale, Brad Paisley and George Lopez.

The guest hosts participated in a sketch in which they signed a summer 2020 guest book for Jimmy.

Kerry joked that she planned on taking over the show forever, while Sean jokingly admitted that he only did it for fun since he's loaded with Will & Grace money.

Jimmy welcomed former NBA star and current TNT basketball analyst Charles Barkley, 57, as his first guest as he returned to hosting.
