The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert was chauffeured around during his post-finale press rounds in a luxury van with tinted windows.

And it seems the 31-year-old got used to the VIP treatment, as he mistakenly climbed into a stranger's car in Sydney on Friday night - thinking it was his personal driver.

At the end of a wild night out with his girlfriend, Irena Srbinovska, Locky was seen strolling down Glenmore Road looking for a taxi back to their hotel.

Whoops! The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert (pictured) left a Sydney driver TERRIFIED after he mistook their car for his Uber following a night out with new girlfriend Irena Srbinovska

After spending several minutes waiting for a ride that he'd never actually booked, he dashed towards the first car stopped at the nearest red light.

'Our Uber is here!' Locky could be heard shouting at Irena and their friends, before he opened the vehicle's back door and sat inside.

The startled driver told the 6ft 5in reality star that he wasn't an Uber driver and politely asked him to leave.

Locky, who was rather embarrassed by the mishap, offered his apologies and stepped out of the car.  

Funny: According to a witness, the 31-year-old Bachelor ran towards the first car that stopped at the red light in front of the group on Friday night, thinking it was their Uber

'Locky get out! That's not your Uber. You haven't ordered one,' shouted a friend from the other side of the road.

An onlooker told Daily Mail Australia: 'Irena was busy talking to their friends when it happened. 

'When they realised what Locky had done, they couldn't believe it. They thought it was so funny.'  

'Locky get out! That's not your Uber. You haven't ordered one,' shouted a friend. 'Irena was busy talking to Bel Colwell, and his friends couldn't believe it,' the witness added

That was quick! At one point Locky and Irena jokingly stopped to look at wedding dresses 

Footage obtained by Daily Mail Australia Locky, Irena and their friends giving up on trying to order an Uber, then walking to Oxford Street in order to hail a taxi.

They seemed to be in giddy spirits while walking down the street, happily chatting to paparazzi and jokingly checking out wedding dresses in the window of a bridal store.

After reaching Oxford Street, the couple decided to part ways with their friends and were finally able to book a ride back to their hotel.

The pair were seen jaywalking as they walked over to their car.
