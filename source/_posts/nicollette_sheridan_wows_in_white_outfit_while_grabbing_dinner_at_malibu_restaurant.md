She secured a Harley-Davidson face mask scarf over her mouth and nose amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Nicollette had her blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail and also carried a matching white purse.

The Desperate Housewives star declined to join her former co-stars for a Desperate Housewives virtual reunion earlier this year.

Marcia Cross, Vanessa Williams, Brenda Strong, Dana Delaney and Eva Longoria all took part in the Stars in The House broadcast on April 12.

Nicollette sparked engagement rumors in September 2019 when she made a red carpet appearance with beau Jake Marcus.

She was previously married to Harry Hamlin, 68, from 1991 to 1992, and he went on to marry Lisa Rinna, 57.

Nicollette also was married to Aaron Phypers, 47, from December 2015 to August 2018 and he is now married to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Denise Richards, 49.

She recently played Alexis Carrington in the revival of Dynasty, but The CW announced in February 2019 that she was leaving to focus on 'some personal family responsibilities'.

Nicollette released a statement saying she was leaving the show to spend time with her terminally ill mother Sally.
