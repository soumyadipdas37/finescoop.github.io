Russell Brand was seen flouting social distancing rules following a performance of his new comedy show Brand-emic as he posed for pictures and hugged a fan.

The stand up star, 45, was pictured taking selfies with audience members, despite claiming in a social media post that they had some 'socially-distanced' fun at his gig.

According to The Sun, Russel told fans that he had 'better go', because he was 'flouting social distancing rules' by being in close contact with them.

The show took place on Monday after the new 'rule of six' was introduced for social gatherings amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Russel's set was inspired by lockdown as he joked how his performance was 'almost empty' due to social distancing rules, however he later mingled without wearing a mask.

According to the publication, Russell told the crowd that he wanted to 'walk the f**k off the stage', after joking how 'poorly attended' his show was. Russell's show wasn't actually poorly attended, he had a socially-distanced audience as required.

Several fans shared snaps of themselves and Russell from the evening, as he stood close to them and posed for photographs. 

MailOnline have contacted Russell's representatives for comment.

The events industry is currently 'starring into the abyss' due to the lack of clarity about the Government ban on gatherings of more than six people, according to the Telegraph.

The publication reported that events organisers are experiencing mass cancellations within the industry, which supports 700,000 employees.  

Jane Longhurst, chief executive of the Meetings Industry Association, said: 'It hasn’t actually defined what government is trying to do, and there’s no clarity, and it has completely shattered any confidence that anyone holding events had.' 

If arts events were deemed against the law, the police have the powers to enforce these legal limits, including to issue fines of £100, doubling for further breaches up to a maximum of £3,200.
