She's been adjusting to parenthood with her husband Joe Jonas ever since they welcomed their daughter Willa in July.

And Sophie Turner took a trip down memory lane as she shared never-before-seen snaps from her pregnancy onto Instagram on Sunday.

In a series of images, the former Game of Thrones star, 24, showcased her baby bump in bikinis as she enjoyed a dip in the pool with her pet pooch.

What a journey: Sophie Turner took a trip down memory lane as she shared never-before-seen snaps from her pregnancy onto Instagram on Sunday, two months after welcoming her child

Oh baby! In a series of images, the former Game of Thrones star, 24, showcased her baby bump in bikinis as she enjoyed a dip in the pool with her pet pooch

The blonde and her musician partner, 31, recently put their Manhattan condo on the market for $5.9million, because they simply don't use it enough, according to TMZ.

They appear to be enjoying their family time at home in Los Angeles, after welcoming Willa two months ago.

A source told Us Weekly of their firstborn's name: 'Willa isn’t a family name and isn’t short for anything. [It] is a name they had picked out a while ago before the baby’s arrival.'

The celebrity couple tied the knot last May in Las Vegas, before having a second ceremony that June in Paris.

Their first pregnancy was announced earlier this year in February, as the Game of Thrones star was spotted showing off her baby bump. 

Another insider told ET in June: 'Joe and Sophie are excited to be new parents and have been enjoying the process of getting ready for their baby.

'Sophie and Joe have been trying to also stay active going on walks and hiking. The whole Jonas family is looking forward to showering the new addition with love. Sophie is due soon and can't wait to be a mom.'
