Matt Preston revealed he was very excited when restaurants across Australia opened their doors for service after almost eight weeks in May.

The 59-year-old chef told New Idea that he cried after having his first post-lockdown restaurant meal.

'My first meal back in a restaurant after lockdown [made me cry],' he told the publication.

'I hadn't realised how much I'd missed out eating with friends,' he added.

In May, businesses across Australia opened their doors for the first time after being closed for dining service for nearly eight weeks.

Cafes, restaurants and bars had only been allowed to offer takeaway service under the restrictions which were introduced on March 23 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

However, Melbourne was placed back under lockdown last month after coronavirus cases increased.

Meanwhile, Matt recently returned to TV alongside MasterChef co-star Gary Mehigan and their new co-host Manu Feildel on Seven's Plate of Origin.

Despite a huge promotional push from the network, the cooking program premiered on August 31 to 667,000 metro viewers.

The numbers have continued to drop each night, with 510,000 viewers tuning in for last Monday's episode, while just 419,000 people watched on Tuesday.

Not only was Plate of Origin defeated in the ratings by Channel 10's The Masked Singer and Nine's The Block, even Anh's Brush with Fame on the ABC pulled in more viewers.

Despite Plate of Origin bombing, Seven has had a strong year with the success of both Big Brother and Farmer Wants a Wife.
