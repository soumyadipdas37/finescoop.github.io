Georginio Wijnaldum 'is increasingly likely' to leave Liverpool and reunite with former Dutch manager Ronald Koeman at Barcelona.

The 29-year-old has played an integral part in Jurgen Klopp's revolution at Anfield, very rarely missing a game as they won the Champions League and Premier League.

Koeman is looking to build his own revolution and knows all about the midfielder having built a strong rapport with him during his time working as his international manager.

Georginio Wijnaldum is reportedly 'increasingly likely' to join Barcelona this summer

The Dutch midfielder's contract at Anfield expires next summer and he looks likely to leave

Goal have reported that Spanish sources have told them that Barcelona are 'confident of landing Koeman's top target'.

The report states that while Liverpool have yet to receive contact from the Spanish giants, 'that is expected to change'. 

Wijnaldum is into the final year of his contract at Anfield and is open to a move to Barcelona, though there has been no sign from him that he is unsettled at Liverpool. 

Barcelona have already brought in Miralem Pjanic but are seeking further reinforcements in midfield as they begin the process of rebuilding in the wake of their Champions League calamity.

Liverpool meanwhile are interested in signing Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara, but are reluctant to pay the Bundesliga side's asking price of £30million.

Wijnaldum joined Liverpool from Newcastle in 2016 and has made 187 appearances for the Reds.

However, he has yet to be offered a new deal and there is a possibility that he could depart before the closure of the transfer window as the club are reluctant to lose him on a free at the end of his contract.

It has been reported that Barcelona could snap up the Dutchman for as little as £15m, 

Wijnaldum would be a loss to Liverpool who has been an integral part of Klopp's system since he joined.
