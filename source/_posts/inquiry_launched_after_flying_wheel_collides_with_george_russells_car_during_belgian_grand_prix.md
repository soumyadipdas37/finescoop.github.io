Officials are investigating how a flying wheel hit the car of British driver George Russell at Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix.

The 22-year-old Williams man was fortunate to escape uninjured after a rear wheel became detached from Antonio Giovinazzi’s Alfa Romeo and travelled into his path at 125mph.

It bounced off his own left-front tyre.

An investigation has been launched after George Russell's car was struck by flying rear wheel

Tethers are meant to prevent wheels coming off during accidents, such as when Giovinazzi lost control on the exit of Fagnes chicane.

FIA race director Michael Masi said: ‘It is a concern that it happened. I am not 100 per cent sure why it was detached but as soon as the car arrived back our technical team started their investigation.

‘We have all the available footage of the accident so the FIA technical department, along with the safety department, will review it. It is too early to draw conclusions.’

The FIA are hoping to reach a verdict before this weekend’s Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the ‘cathedral of speed’, where the average lap speeds are just under 160mph.
