Bella Varelis was brutally blindsided and dumped by Bachelor Locky Gilbert during the reality TV show's dramatic finale.

But Bella appears to have put her heartbreak aside since filming ended, and has apparently jumped head first into finding love again.

According to Woman's Day on Monday, the marketing manger, 26, has been spotted on dating app, Tinder.

A Tinder profile surfaced last week, with fans claiming they'd happily 'swipe right' to pair with Bella on the free dating service.

It's unclear if the profile was real, as fake and catfish accounts often are created with photos of celebrity and reality TV stars. 

Bachelor host Osher Gunsberg also hinted the Sydney-based stunner could be headed for season four of Bachelor In Paradise.

Discussing the finale on Channel 10's podcast The Reality Bite: Cocktails and Roses, Osher said: 'Maybe it’s not the last we’ll see of Bella.'

'I don’t know if we’re going to go back at any point, but part of me really wants to say "bula Bella" under a bure, but I don’t know if we’re going to do Paradise in Fiji at the moment. I don’t know what’s going to happen,' he said. 

Osher's podcast co-host and former Bachelor In Paradise star Alisha Aitken-Radburn suggested Queensland's Noosa might make for a suitability alternative amid current coronavirus travel restrictions.   

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Bella Varelis for comment.

Meanwhile, Locky has been flaunting his new relationship with Irena at every opportunity since breaking things off with Bella in the finale.

He even took a subtle jab at Bella during a hike with Irena in New South Wales on Sunday.

'She does hike! I'm seeing it with my own eyes!' he said, after Bella had accused Irena of lying about her love of hiking on the show.
