My Kitchen Rules judge Manu Feildel stunned fans on Tuesday when he showed off his shrinking frame during a bike ride. 

The 46-year-old, who has dropped an impressive 12kg in just three months, revealed his flat stomach and slimmed-down face as he promoted his weight loss challenge, Below the Belt. 

The popular celebrity chef is raising money for the ANZUP Cancer Trials Group, by encouraging people to cycle, run, walk or swim as many kilometres as possible in the month of September.

The culinary star has shredded several pounds off his frame over the past few months. 

In addition to changing his diet, ditching alcohol and joining a gym, Manu has said road cycling had helped his battle with the bulge. 

In July, he also revealed he was trying out an ab-sculpting machine to help with his health and fitness goals. 

Manu shared a video of himself on Instagram, relaxing on his back and reading a book at a Sydney clinic called Body Catalyst.

On his torso was a device that made a loud buzzing sound.

He wrote in the caption: 'Some people may think that I'm a little vain, but no! Just a little lazy.'

'I've been training five days a week for a while, but also have enjoyed my food and a couple of wines here and there, and when I saw the [clinic] had a machine to help out, I thought I'd give it a try.'

'Stay posted, a new Manu in a few weeks,' he added.  

In January, Manu posted on Instagram to show how he looked in both series 10 and series 11 of MKR, writing 'no words needed' next to the comparison snap.  

The trainer who is responsible for celebrity chef Manu Feildel's 12 kilogram is Chief Brabon - and he runs the celebrity transformation club SKWOD.

Chief trained Manu for a total of 12 weeks with his partner Emilie Brabon, resulting in more than 12 kilos of fat loss and a brand new magnifique body for Manu.

Chief previously told Daily Mail Australia that he first came across Manu and his wife Clarissa when they both pitched up to his exercise studio in Sydney at the start of 2019.

'They told me that they were determined to lose weight, and wanted to begin as soon as Manu had a break between training,' he said.

Chief said he got the 46-year-old chef and his wife 'thinking about what they were eating and what they wanted to achieve', before he told them to set a time frame in which they would transform their bodies.

Settling on 12 weeks, he told the couple they would be training five times a week for 45 minutes per session, and they would need to follow a specific diet outlined by Emilie.

Better diet: The first thing that needed clearing up was the French chef's diet. He was told to replace all the red meat he was eating with white meat, seafood and lean fish

'Manu was very determined, and when the filming break rolled around, we got started,' Chief said. 

The first thing that needed clearing up was the French chef's diet.

Being a foodie, Chief said Emilie told Manu to replace all the red meat he was eating with white meat, seafood and lean fish.

She also told him to completely cut alcohol and sugar from his diet, and also get rid of both processed and complex carbs for a week.

'It was tough, as he is a chef and used to eating, but as a world we are all too addicted to carbs,' Chief said.

'We did re-introduce complex carbs slowly after week one, but getting rid of them entirely in the first week is all about giving your body a quick boost and re-training your mind around your relationship with carbohydrates.' 

The second step was getting Manu and Clarissa on a regular training regime, whereby the two attended classes at SKWOD five times a week for 45 minutes per session.

'We follow a method called DARC,' Chief said.

'This stands for Dynamic Aerobic Resistance Conditioning and it's basically the child of HIIT and weight training.'

He said that rather than try and train the celebrities like bodybuilders, he and Emilie train them like athletes so that they end up being 'the most athletic version of themselves possible'.

'For Manu, we did all sorts of exercises, from boxing to weight training and hill sprints on a treadmill during tough intervals.

'At the beginning, he was a heavy tall guy and so he looked like a baby elephant on the treadmill.

'But by week three or four, he had totally changed his technique and looked like a fullback rugby player.'
