It's clear Locky Gilbert has a penchant for getting naked. 

On Thursday night, the 31-year-old hunk sensationally showed off his soapy behind during a virtual bubble bath on The Bachelor.  

And now footage has surfaced of the strapping adventure seeker stripping down to his birthday suit to greet a friend in Germany. 

Not again! On Thursday, footage surfaced of Locky Gilbert stripping naked to 'surprise one of his best friends'... after sensationally baring his soapy behind on The Bachelor 

In the footage shared to Locky's Instagram account, the reality star is shown laying across his friend's bed stark naked waiting for him to come home. 

His mate then opens the door and is shocked to find him in all his naked glory.

Despite getting an eyeful, the pals share an embrace despite Locky's lack of clothing. 

'Travelled to Europe to surprise one of me best friends,' he captioned the video.

Naked ambition: 'Travelled to Europe to surprise one of me best friends,' he captioned the video

This comes after Locky stood up naked in a bath during a virtual date with Izzy Sharman-Firth on Thursday night's episode of The Bachelor. 

It's safe to say most fans weren't expecting the raunchy moment, especially given the show's 7.30pm time slot.

'I am UNCOMFY with the angles I witnessed!' tweeted one unsuspecting viewer, while another wrote, 'Truly a miracle we didn't all cop and [sic] eyeful of testicle'.

A third wrote: 'To the poor @Channel10AU editors that had to meticulously edit Locky's junk out of this scene, I'm so sorry.' 

One person said they felt like they were 'intruding on a very awkward Zoom call' after the coronavirus pandemic forced production of the show into lockdown.

Added another: 'The bubbles were disintegrating way too quickly for my liking... much like my mental health during 2020...' 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
