And while the pandemic is partly to blame for the couple's move, Hilfiger said it isn't the only reason. 

'As creative people, we’re always looking for that next project,' he told the Journal.  

The home, which was built in 1939 for real estate investor Charles Vincent Paterno, sits at the top of Round Hill Road.

According to the Journal, the residence was also owned by financier and prolific art collector Joseph Hirshhorn. 

Hilfiger said that he and his wife spent three years working on the home after it fell into disrepair.   

He told the newspaper that they redid the home's mechanicals and rewiring. They also added new plumbing and ventilation. 

Hilfiger said they even contracted a company in Turkey to fabricate the terra-cotta tiles to match the originals and hired landscape architect Miranda Brooks to design the gardens, hedges and fountains.

The couple spent millions on the project, which Hilfiger said 'took a lot of patience'.
