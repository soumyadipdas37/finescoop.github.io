Casey Mazzucchelli rose to fame on Channel Seven's reboot of Big Brother this year.

But it seems the 25-year-old is distancing herself from the reality TV show. 

It appears the brunette beauty has deleted any photos and promo images relating to the show from her Instagram account. 

Regret much? Casey Mazzucchelli appears to be distancing herself from Big Brother after she Instagram posts relating to the reality TV show 

There is, however, one photo featuring herself with her Big Brother co-stars Daniel Gorringe, Xavier Molyneux, Mat Garrick and Ian Joass, sitting on the steps of a deck.

She wrote in the caption of that post, which was shared back in July: 'Weird, I think @danielgorringe_ used to play footy or something.'

Aside from that group photo, there is no other Big Brother related images.

There is also a quiet a gap between posts made from February 21 to April 15, and May 31 to July 22, which correlate with the dates the show was filming and when the show aired.

Big Brother was pre-recorded from February to March, and aired on the network from June to July. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Casey for comment.

The Perth-based beauty has instead filled her Instagram account with selfies, photos with her boyfriend and friends, as well as photos of nature.

A likely reason for Casey removed her Big Brother photos is because she received hundreds of death threats on Instagram.

In July, she told New Idea: 'I had probably close to 400 messages telling me to kill myself. It was really, really quite traumatic.' 

Casey said she felt helpless because she couldn't understand what she'd done to deserve such hateful messages.

Locking horns: During her time on the show, the Perth-based brunette (right) famously locked horns with with Angela Clancy (left) 

'I had a little cry about it and that was that,' she admitted, adding that the trolling had since stopped 'for now.'

On the show, Casey famously locked horns with Angela Clancy, who insinuated that she didn't deserve to win the $250,000 prize money, she said: 'Screw you, Ange! That is so rude... How dare you say I haven't earned my place here.'

Some viewers accused Casey of being 'racist' following the showdown, prompting Casey to defend herself on Instagram with a strongly worded essay where she reminded viewers that her 'boyfriend is a person of colour'.
