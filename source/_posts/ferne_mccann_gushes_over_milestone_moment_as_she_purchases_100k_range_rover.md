Gushing over her achievement she wrote: 'The harder you work the luckier you get.'  

'Having a work ethic has always been so important to me. Even more so since having Sunday. I'm so grateful for every work opportunity that's come my way and I have seized each one of them. 

'Buying this car is a milestone that shows how far I've come and I'm immensely grateful . (Thankyou & SO MUCH love to kai88_ for sorting me my new whip skurrt skurrt....the sexiest car Thankyou Thankyou.)

Her outing comes after she spoke candidly on pal Vicky Pattison's podcast about the realities of raising her daughter Sunday, two, on her own, saying 'being a single mum is hard'.

The ITVBE star also revealed she would want to to be in a 'partnership' if she had another child and is looking for love on celeb dating app Raya. 

Speaking to Vicky on her podcast The Secret To earlier this month, Ferne discussed how it is tough at times being a single parent but that now she just sees herself as 'Sunday's mum'. 

However the reality star did reveal that she would want to be in a relationship if she ever had another baby. 

She said: 'I am just Sunday's mum and I look at I think that if I were to have another baby, I would love to do it in a partnership and as a team.

'Because I look at my friends and people on Instagram, even though that's not as it seems, but I look at my friends and sister and her husband and think you make a fantastic team.  

'So it wasn't what I'd hoped [becoming a mother] but honestly now, it's kind of, being a single parent is hard, I've got an amazing support network and I felt for so many single parents in lockdown.  

Gushing over her achievement she wrote: 'The harder you work the luckier you get'

'I was so lucky that my mum moved in with me for a considerable amount of time, but there were people that didn't have that luxury, and it was hard.'

Ferne also agreed with the Geordie Shore star, who she met in the I'm A Celebrity jungle in 2015, that there's more pressure on her to provide as she's a single parent.  

The reality TV pals also discussed Ferne's dating life, with her revealing that she's giving the celeb app Raya to try to look for love.

Ferne said: 'Every single celeb is on it. There's loads of influencers, footballers, sports men, you name it they're on it. And it is a lot of fun and it definitely did pass the time in lockdown. 

'But I'm not here to talk about my experience on this dating app, what I was going to say is you're perception of age, mine's skewed because when I'm seeing thirty year old men on this celebrity dating app, I'm like nah, too old! (..) Haha! 

'Now I've kind of checked in with myself and I'm like, Ferne you are turning thirty, and it's time to maybe try talk to some older guys!'
