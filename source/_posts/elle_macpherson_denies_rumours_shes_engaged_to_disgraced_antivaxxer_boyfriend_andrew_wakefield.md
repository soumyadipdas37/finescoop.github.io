Elle Macpherson has shut down rumours she's engaged to her boyfriend, disgraced anti-vaxxer doctor Andrew Wakefield.

The Australian supermodel, 56, recently sparked engagement speculation when she was spotted on Instagram with a ring on her wedding finger - not long after Andrew, 63, officially divorced his ex-wife Carmel on August 30th. 

However, Elle's spokesperson told The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday that her mystery ring isn't what it seems.

'Elle frequently wears her Yoga ring on her 'wedding' finger... it's just a rumour', her spokesperson said. 

It comes as a flurry of false reports emerge claiming that the glamorous businesswoman is already planning her wedding to Andrew.  

Woman's Day magazine alleged on Wednesday that Elle is looking forward to settling down with the discredited doctor.

False alarm: 'Elle frequently wears her Yoga ring on her 'wedding' finger... it's just a rumour', her spokesperson said. Elle is pictured wearing a gold band on her wedding finger in an Instagram selfie on Monday 

'She's very happy and everyone thinks a wedding is on the cards', a source claimed, adding that the couple 'work well together' despite Andrew's controversial history.   

Wednesday's New Idea magazine went so far as to claim Elle and Andrew plan to tie the knot 'in a matter of weeks'. 

'She doesn't want to waste time, so they're planning a quickie ceremony... something small and intimate,' an 'insider' claimed.

'Elle is really excited. It will be the wedding of the year in her adopted hometown of Miami,' they added.  

Andrew is infamous for falsely claiming that the MMR vaccine causes autism.

The discredited former doctor was struck off the British medical register in 2010 for unethical behaviour and misconduct.

He then moved to America, where he is lionised in certain anti-vaxxer circles - Donald Trump and Robert De Niro are among his fans - with his then-wife, Carmel, 62, and their four children.

He and Carmel, who settled in Austin, Texas, are said to have separated in early 2017 after 32 years of marriage. 

In November that year, he met Elle at a 'Doctors Who Rock' awards ceremony in Orlando, Florida.  

The couple were first spotted kissing at a farmers’ market in Miami in 2018.
