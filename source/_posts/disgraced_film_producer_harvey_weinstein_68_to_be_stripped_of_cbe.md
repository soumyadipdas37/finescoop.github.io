Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein is set to be stripped of his CBE by the Government this week after his conviction for rape. 

Weinstein, 68, who was sentenced to 23 years in prison by a US court earlier this year, is expected to lose the CBE when the Honours Forfeiture Committee meets on Friday to consider recipients who have brought the system into disrepute. 

The move follows a campaign by playwright Polly Creed for Britain to follow the example of France, where President Emmanuel Macron set in train the process for removing Weinstein's Legion d'Honneur within days of the allegations surfacing in 2017.

A string of actresses made harassment claims against Weinstein, including Ashley Judd, Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Léa Seydoux. 

More than 80 women came forward – with many saying they were blacklisted from lucrative projects if they rejected his advances. 

Weinstein was awarded the honorary CBE in 2004, for services to the British film industry. 

Those who have had honours stripped include Russian spy Anthony Blunt and Fred Goodwin, who steered the Royal Bank of Scotland to an annual loss of £24.1billion.
