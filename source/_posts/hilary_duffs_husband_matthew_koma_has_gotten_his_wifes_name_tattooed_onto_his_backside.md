Matthew Koma is one committed husband and father.

The musician, 33, is the beloved spouse to one Hilary Duff, and on Monday he revealed the latest way he's demonstrating his undying love for his dear wife.  

In a very cheeky Instagram post, the Winnetka Bowling League frontman showed off a brand new tattoo of Duff's first name – scrawled onto his left buttock.

The ink displays Hilary's name – one 'L', not two – scrawled in a cursive that some users commented was actually her signature.

'Good luck winning a fight with your wife when her name's tattooed on your butt cheek,' Matthew captioned the literally cheeky snap. 

He added the hashtags #squats #gainz and #laseraway, the first two referring to his efforts at toning that particular part of his body with exercise.

Hilary, for her part, vociferously approved of the body decoration, writing in the comments, 'Finest tiniest booty around'. 

She also added a hashtag of her own: #YouStuckNowBoy.  

Other famous followers chimed in as well, with Mandy Moore simply commenting, 'Dying' and comedienne Whitney Cummings joking, 'Wait I just got this too'.

And Hilary's moniker isn't the only tatt Koma has recently added onto his person.

Just last week, he displayed another image on Instagram, this time showing what appeared to be a tattoo on the back of his thigh in honor of his daughter with Duff, Banks. 

The illustration shows a crowned troll, with a toothy grin, wearing a fur cape of sorts.

In the caption, Koma explained the reasoning for the adornment.

'When your daughter’s favorite movie is Trolls and your best friend is the voice of Gristle, you have @jaynawon tattoo this on you. Thanks for the Bergen ❤️'

The ink is clearly an ode to the 2016 animated film adored by Banks, almost two, as well as Matthew's good friend, Superbad star Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who voiced King Gristle in the film as well as this year's Trolls World Tour sequel.

Duff and Koma have been in a relationship since January 2017, which eventually led to them getting married in December 2019.

The Younger actress had previously been married to NHL athlete Mike Comrie for nearly five years when she filed for divorce in February 2015.

The pair share son Luca Cruz, eight.
