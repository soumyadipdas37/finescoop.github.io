Sian Clifford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge had to dash to a neighbour's house to watch the BAFTAs due to technical difficulties right before the show. 

The Fleabag stars had planned to spend the ceremony - which was held virtually in July - together in Phoebe's back garden. 

Yet technical support revealed that they couldn't both appear via Zoom from Phoebe's home due to feedback issues, throwing their plans into chaos.

Nearly missed it! Sian Clifford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge had to dash to a neighbour's house to watch the BAFTAs due to technical difficulties at the last minute

Sian, 38, - who scooped the Female Performance in a Comedy Programme BAFTA - recalled: 'The whole thing was so ''Fleabag''. When Phoebe and I are together, things like this often happen.'

Speaking about her original plans, she said: 'Dappled sunlight, gorgeous lighting, everything planned...

'I had a dress from Vampire's Wives. Really contemporary, beautifully made, fit me like a glove. I was very happy.'

Dream come true: Sian - who scooped the Female Performance in a Comedy Programme BAFTA - recalled: 'The whole thing was so ''Fleabag''

At first, the actresses were determined to 'try and disprove' the technical support team wrong, but realised they needed to find another solution and scrambled to be ready just minutes before the ceremony started.

Sian told Closer magazine: 'So we tried it - to try and disprove them and of course they were right.

'Then we tried with me sitting inside and Phoebe outside and the lighting was just terrible.

Win: Sian, 38, took home the Best Female Performance In A Comedy Programme and even beat her co-star and show creator Phoebe 

'Then she remembered our friend Josh from down the road was on holiday and said, 'I've got his key!'

'We had to try and get his WiFi password while he's up a mountain in Skye. It was absolute chaos - and this was five minutes before it began. 

'Phoebe wasn't dressed and I said, 'You know it starts in, like, a minute?' I'd showed up ready and she was like, 'Whaaaaaat?' '

Whoops! At first, the actresses were determined to 'try and disprove' the technical support team wrong, but realised they needed to find another solution

During the preparations, the pair had called former 'Fleabag' star Jamie Demetriou to wish him luck for his show, 'Stath Lets Flats', for which he went on to win the Male Performance in a Comedy Programme gong, as well as Scripted Comedy - and Sian believes its success further highlighted her friend's influence.

She said: 'He's Fleabag alumnus. When you break down the British TV landscape of the last 12 months, the Fleabag' influence - those doors that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has inched open for audacious, funny, irreverent and true storytelling on TV - are everywhere.'

It comes after Sian opened up about her first BAFTA win earlier this week in an interview with Grazia.  

She admitted: 'I mean, amazing. I am still reverberating, honestly.'  

BAFTA night: The pair eventually went to their neighbour's house so that they could set up the Zoom call there
