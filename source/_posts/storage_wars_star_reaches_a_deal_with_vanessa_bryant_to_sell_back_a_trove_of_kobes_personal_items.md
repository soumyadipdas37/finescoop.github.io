A cast member of A&E's Storage Wars who got his hands on a treasure trove of Kobe Bryant's personal memorabilia has transferred most of the belongings over to the Lakers legend's widow Vanessa Bryant as part of a top-secret deal.

After the unit recently sold at auction for just $375, Rene Nezhoda, bought the 35 pairs of sneakers that belonged to his stylist, an all-access badge labelled with his nickname 'Mamba', and more items for $13,000.

But representatives for Vanessa Bryant got in touch with Nezhoda after learning about the unit and managed to get most of the items for an undisclosed amount.  

'Everything has been worked out. A number of personal items, worn items, and paperwork were sold directly back to the Bryant family,' Nezhoda told TMZ on Thursday.

The deal was reportedly not about making a profit but getting the items from the abandoned storage locker back to the Bryants in a fair way. 

Kobe and 13-year-old daughter Gigi Bryant died in January, leaving behind Vanessa and three of their children.

The storage unit purportedly contained practice gear, tax returns and even a mink coat from a photo shoot. 

According to someone close to the deal Nezhoda was able to keep some items that had not been worn by Kobe.

Nezhoda reportedly plans on selling those pieces for a profit. 

Nezhoda had previously claimed that the unit belonged to Bryant's former stylist Derek Roche. However, a spokeswoman for Roche told the Daily Mail that her client had nothing to do with the unit. It remains unclear who owned the unit before it went to auction. 

Speaking with the Daily Mail in August, Nezhoda said he had been in touch with Bryant family attorneys. Nezhoda went on to say he's returning some of the items to Bryant's widow Vanessa at her request.  

In addition to a laminated pass reading 'Mamba,' Bryant's nickname, the Lakers legend's tax documents were also revealed in the storage unit

'Storage Wars' typically centers on the auctioning of mysterious storage lockers, which went up for sale when the owners stopped paying their bill. Nezhoda previously said he expected to triple his investment.

Nezhoda said in August he'd been in touch with Vanessa to see if she would like to have the kids' jerseys and sneakers returned that presumably belonged to her four daughters.

Nezhoda went on to say there were even more items from the unit that he was negotiating to purchase.

'The 2 huge Wardrobe boxes that we didn't get to see that appeared to have bedding in them had more stuff on the bottom half of them,' Nezhoda wrote on YouTube. 

'Some of the items include several pairs of Sean John Sunglasses that probably belonged to him directly since he works for bad Boy Entertainment, 5 pieces of Kobe Warms ups all used, couple of more pairs of shoes, another nice fur jacket, Versace Shoes Owned and Used by LITTLE KIM super BLING BLING LOOKING and a bunch more of Brand New Designer Clothes!'

However Nezhoda said that the seller had 'increased his asking price to $26,000 for that stuff so we will see if we can work out a deal.'
