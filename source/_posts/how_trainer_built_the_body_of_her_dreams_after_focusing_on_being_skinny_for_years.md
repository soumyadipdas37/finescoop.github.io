An Australian personal trainer has revealed how she gave up on the unhealthy idea of being 'skinny' to build the body of her dreams.   

Sophie Allen, 30, from Sydney, started her fitness journey in 2017, initially wanting to lose weight, and has since gone on to compete in some of the country's toughest bikini competitions.

Now she takes a more moderated approach to her gym sessions and has come up with a routine that fits into her regular work hours, affording her a social life on the side.

An Australian personal trainer has revealed how she gave up on the unhealthy idea of being 'skinny' and build the body of her dreams

'All I wanted was to be skinny, to shrink parts of myself that I didn't love. Skinny was "in" when I started my fitness journey... then I decided to blow up the ideas I had around beauty and focus on getting STRONG,' she wrote on Instagram.

'Focusing on strength, the basic principles of progressive overload, and HEALTH as a combined approach is how I've achieved my physique today. 

'Neither is better, nor am I posting this for people to vote... I just want to share that my goals went from "get me skinny no matter the cost" to "get me healthy no matter the cost".

Sophie's idea of health is nourishing her body, lifting weights and moving daily in an enjoyable way, so she's paving a lifestyle that supports these things.

'There's nothing special about me, I started at the beginning too. If you don't think you'll ever achieve your dreams - let this be your reminder. Follow the process, don't give up and  don't forget you're capable of more'. 

One of the most dramatic physical changes Sophie has seen is the size and toning of her glute muscles, which are remarkably different in both photos.

Her favourite lower body workout includes front squats, Russian dead lifts, leg press single leg, seated leg curl and cable pull throughs.

Although it's only a few movements they target every part of your glutes so you're creating a well rounded derrière after each session.

Breakfast: Oats, coconut yoghurt, berries and peanut butter

Lunch: Chicken, pumpkin and vegetables

Dinner: Coconut green chicken curry with prawns, fish and rice

Dessert: Protein oats with berries, Loving Earth chocolate and peanut butter

On top of that she eats 1,700 calories a day to maintain her energy, starting with a breakfast bowl of berries and coconut yoghurt and a side vegetable salad (pictured at the start of her journey left)

Lunch might be a chicken and kale, green bean and snow pea salad, a protein shake as an afternoon snack and a stir fry for dinner.

In a recent YouTube video Sophie explained that she was trialling a candida diet to help with her gut health and so far was enjoying it, although it did restrict what kind of carbohydrates she could eat. 

The candida diet is a strict eating style that eliminates sugar, gluten, dairy and alcohol, because there are claims these foods and drinks promote candida overgrowth in your system. 

'I'm not craving sugar or anything yet. High fat is usually pretty good at satiating you and I know it's only a month before I can bring in some more carbs,' she said.
