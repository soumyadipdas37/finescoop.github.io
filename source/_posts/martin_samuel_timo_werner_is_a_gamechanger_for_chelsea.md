Watching Timo Werner it is incredible to think how long Chelsea have gone to here without genuine pace in their front-line.

Not a striker who is a bit lively. Not one who is a wonderful, bruising irritant, like Diego Costa, a battering ram of a centre-forward. Quick, as Werner was to win the penalty for the first goal. Rapid, as he appeared late in the first half, when he pulled clear of his man and tried to beat Mat Ryan at the near post.

Speed has never been more important in the modern game, yet Chelsea, for all their success, have often done without. 

Timo Werner is a different type of striker to what Chelsea have had for several years

Players that were supposed to be fast, like Fernando Torres, turned up slow. Big names disappointed. Frank Lampard worked with the greatest striker of the Roman Abamovich era in Didier Drogba, so it is no surprise that given his first major transfer window, he made finding a world-class goalscorer his priority. 

We all know the weaknesses of Chelsea’s defence; we know Kepa Arrizabalaga has not lived up to expectations in goal. He was at fault for Brighton’s equaliser, slow down to long-range shot, and his replacement cannot arrive soon enough. 

This is a team that kept one clean sheet away from home in the Premier League last season, and ended the 2019-20 campaign conceding 11 goals in four games. 

Yet Lampard still went in pursuit of Werner and a supporting cast to supply him. He wanted to make Chelsea a threat again: and he looks to have succeeded.

The midfield has, for too long, picked up the slack at Chelsea. Lampard did it as a player, year after year, so prolific that it took the arrival of no less a talent than Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United to challenge. 

Then it was Eden Hazard. Not every season, but when he fancied it. And when he fancied it, there really was no-one better.

In between, strikers came and went. Costa was a horror show for defenders, but eventually for his manager too. Alvaro Morata was a crashing disappointment, given his £60m fee. Lampard, hands tied in the transfer market, showed faith in Tammy Abraham but he came up just short last season and increasingly lost his place to Olivier Giroud. 

His dash which led to Chelsea being awarded a penalty show they now have pace up-front

The Frenchman has his qualities but it is hard to imagine him in the mix at the three clubs that finished above Chelsea last season. And, no, it wasn’t the most impressive performance from Chelsea at Brighton last night. 

They still look vulnerable at the back, and much of the passing was sloppy. But, in Werner, they have got one. And reasonably priced, too. Given what Manchester United are being asked for Jadon Sancho, the ball park £48m for Werner does not appear too extravagant.

Perhaps that is what had got under Jurgen Klopp’s skin when he sniped about ownership models in the week. 

Maybe Liverpool’s manager saw Werner as an option at his own club, either this summer or in 12 months’ time. 

Last year, Chelsea did not have a striker who would have got a sniff at Liverpool or Manchester United, even Manchester City. 

Timo Werner joined Frank Lampard's  Chelsea in the summer from RB Leipzig for a fee of £45

Chelsea signed Werner though for a while it seemed he would join Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool

Now they have. Kai Havertz, the other big signing, struggled on his debut. Werner, by contrast, looked at home straight away. Klopp, so familiar with the Bundesliga, will have known what Chelsea were getting all along.

He was wrong to paint Chelsea and Manchester City as somehow less worthy, though. As former Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said, there is no such thing as the golden era of football club ownership. 

It isn’t as if Roman Abramovich has corrupted a spotless competition, or that Liverpool’s owners are motivated by pure altruism. Fenway are venture capitalists. Liverpool are an investment. 

That is why a player such as Philippe Coutinho had a price, and why Werner’s could not be met. Liverpool are a brilliantly run club, their recruitment strategy probably the finest in the country, but it fits the business model of venture capitalism. 

At Chelsea, a very rich man picked up the ball and is running with it. Revenue streams have been successfully managed – Brighton’s best player last night Tariq Lamptey, signed from Stamford Bridge for £4m, possibly rising to £6m, is proof of that – but this has been a personal project, the vision of one very ambitious man.

So it’s different. Not worse; not alien. Liverpool and Chelsea have both raised funds in recent seasons by selling major players – Suarez and Coutinho, Oscar, Costa and Hazard – but Lampard is right when he says Liverpool are reaping the rewards of backing one manager. His squad still carries the ghosts of bosses past. Jorginho, N’Golo Kante, Marcos Alonso, Cesar Azpilicueta.

Yet in Werner we see how Lampard wants to play, the attributes he seeks from his Chelsea. Other summer arrivals will make the starting line-up leaner and livelier. 

He is yet to bring in his old hand, his warrior, Thiago Silva in the heart of defence, too. This was a decent result but better performances will surely come when Lampard has every option as his disposal.

Late in the second-half, Ross Barkley released Werner again and he sped into the area as Chelsea strikers so often don’t. 

There may have been team-mates in stronger positions but Werner was always going to go it alone, and Havertz seemed to recognise it. His suspicions were justified.

So no goals, but this was a game full of promise. It was his sprint which won the penalty and broke the deadlock, his movement and danger that will have been noted by defenders everywhere. 

He is a new Chelsea striker, a different Chelsea striker. It’s been a few years since they have seen one like him in west London. Werner is a game-changer.
