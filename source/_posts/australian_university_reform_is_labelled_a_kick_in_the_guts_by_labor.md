The Federal Government's plans to more than double the cost of some university degrees is a 'kick in the guts' for year 12 students, Labor argues.

The opposition's education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek says she's heard from many parents who have seen their kids go through the 'year from hell' with remote learning disrupting their final year of school.

'(Parents) are saying what a kick in the teeth this is for their kids,' she told ABC radio on Friday.

'Kids who - in many cases - two, three, four years ago set their heart on a particular degree.

'This year being told that degree will more than double in price. It's been a terrible kick in the guts and that's what parents are telling me.'

IT, science and engineering degrees will drop by $2,000 per year asÂ school leavers get financial incentives to choose 'job-relevant' degrees

Under the changes, some humanities courses would more than double in cost in a bid to encourage people to enrol in courses the government argues lead to higher employability.

Nursing qualifications will cost just $3,700 per year while IT, science and engineering degrees will drop by $2,000 per year.

Meanwhile humanities degrees are expected to jump from $6,804 per year to $14,500.

Science and maths would be among the degrees made cheaper, along with agriculture, environmental sciences and health.

Teaching and nursing degrees are expected to drop by 45 per cent, while a law degree will cost 28 per cent more.

There will also be 39,000 new places available to prospective students next year, with Mr Tehan expected to say it will 'give students a choice'.

The Senate's education committee is due to report on its inquiry into the bill on Friday, after only three weeks to run a fine tooth comb over it.

The government is negotiating closely with the Senate cross bench in a bid to pass the proposal, with numbers tight in the upper house.
