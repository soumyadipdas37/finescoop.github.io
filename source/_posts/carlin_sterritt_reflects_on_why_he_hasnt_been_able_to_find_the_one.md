He confirmed his split from Angie Kent in July after 10 months of dating.

And on Sunday, Carlin Sterritt, 32, reflected on a three-year-old Facebook post where he claimed there was no such thing as the one perfect partner.

'If The One exists, then all four categories would be met: compatibility, sexual chemistry, spirituality/beliefs, morals/standards and behaviours,' he wrote in 2017.

The personal trainer-turned-reality star went on to compare relationships to a 'dynamic puzzle'.

'... You can find a good fit, but the puzzle is always changing,' he said, before noting: 'The relationships that last are the one's that are learning to change.'

Underneath the lengthy post, Carlin answered his former self by asking: 'OK 2017 Carlin... but I'm still single,' alongside the shrugging emoji.

It comes just days after the hunky star broke his silence on hurtful rumours that his relationship with Angie was a carefully orchestrated 'showmance'.

Carlin, who has acted in the past, recently told podcast Beyond the White Room that his intentions were always genuine.

He said he 'was constantly bombarded with people's opinions' about his character and intentions while The Bachelorette was airing on TV.

'This show, it's you, you're putting yourself out there... I'm not portraying a character,' Carlin said, responding to critics who accused him of being 'fake'.

Carlin and Angie announced their break-up on July 1, after weeks of speculation they had quietly called it quits.
