She's been enjoying the Stateside life ever since she relocated to California to be closer to her boyfriend Anwar Hadid. 

And Dua Lipa looked completely smitten with her model beau in images shared to Instagram from their hike in Palm Springs on Tuesday.

The singer, 25, and the younger brother of supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid, 21, put on a cosy display as the couple treated themselves to some quality time.

Cutting a casual figure, the One Kiss hitmaker teamed a monochrome vest with running capri leggings and white trainers.

The pop princess wore her tresses in a slick bun while allowing her skin to breathe by wearing minimal make-up.

Anwar opted for an equally dressed-down appearance in navy trousers and a matching shirt which he left unbuttoned to showcase his heavily-tattooed chest.

Relishing in their romantic outing, the pair hugged and gazed adoringly at each other before the hunk treated the brunette beauty to a piggy-back ride.

Their outing comes after Dua upped sticks and travelled across the pond to Los Angeles to be closer to California native Anwar.

The Sun reported The One Kiss hitmaker has relocated stateside to live with her partner due to fears that she won't be able to travel to and fro because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK. 

A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end. 

'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic. 

'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time.
