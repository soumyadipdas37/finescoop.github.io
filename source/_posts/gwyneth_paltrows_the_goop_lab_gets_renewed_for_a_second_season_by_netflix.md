The first season of The Goop Lab explored orgasm workshops, psychedelic treatments and exorcisms. 

And Gwyneth Paltrow is heading back to Netflix along with her Goop team, for a second season of the documentary series. 

Season two will follow the same format as the debut season with six 30-minute episodes with a release date to be determined, Variety reported on Thursday. 

Coming back: Gwyneth Paltrow is heading back to Netflix along with her Goop team, for a second season of the documentary series, The Goop Lab, Variety reported on Thursday

The new episodes will look at 'sex, intimacy and female empowerment,' according to the outlet. 

Paltrow will return as co-host of the series, with Goop editorial director Elise Loehnen, and will serve again as executive producer with Loehnen and Shauna Minoprio. 

Season one premiered in January 2020 and was nominated for two Critic's Choice Awards for Lifestyle: Fashion/Beauty and Paltrow for Female Star of the Year. 

Before it even debuted, The Goop Lab and Netflix garnered backlash based on previous criticisms of the brand.

Paltrow has come under fire over the years for touting 'pseudoscience,' eccentric and expensive health fads on Goop, including vaginal steams, a 'psychic vampire repellent,' and detoxes.  

In September 2018, Goop paid $145,000 to settle a lawsuit accusing it of making unsubstantiated claims about the health benefits of vaginal eggs and a flower essence that 'could help prevent depression.'  

Goop has been barred from making any claims regarding the health benefits of its products 'without possessing competent and reliable scientific evidence,' and from manufacturing or selling any falsely advertised medical devices. 

And in 2018, the brand's partnership with Conde Nast to produce a magazine, fell apart when the publisher insisted claims be fact-checked.

'I think for us it was really like we like to work where we are in an expansive space. Somewhere like Condé, understandably, there are a lot of rules,' Paltrow told NYT Magazine at the time adding the publisher like to 'do things in a very old-school way.'

However, that doesn't mean the actress and her team have squelched their desire to try far-out practices in the name of wellness.  

'The Goop Lab explores the universal questions we’re inherently curious about,' Gwyneth said in a statement about the show at the time of its premiere. 

'We took the open-minded approach that we’ve cultivated at Goop and applied a different, visual lens with Netflix. In the process, we found new ways to answer this: How do we make the most of our lives?'
