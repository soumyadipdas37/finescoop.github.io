Police were called and Byrnes left before returning an hour later in a rage of fury as she began yelling, banging on doors and crying as she 'got her belongings', Fraser Coast Chronicle reported. 

The grandfather, 78, was helping unload items from a car to give to Byrnes when she grabbed him and threw him aggressively onto the ground.

The man suffered bruising and bleeding to his arm, a grazed knee and pain. 

The mother-of-one then threw a brick through the back window the man's vehicle. 

Byrnes appeared in Hervey Magistrate's Court on four charges including serious assault including charge to wilful damage after smashing the window with a shovel.

Her lawyer told the court that his client was emotional at the time of the attack on the elderly man following the breakup. 

Byrnes apologised to her ex-boyfriend's grandfather and was ordered to pay $250 for the broken car window. 

She was also handed a 12 months' probation with no conviction recorded.
