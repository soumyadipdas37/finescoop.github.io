A mother's handmade coffee tables cleverly repurposed from old car tyres are attracting a legion of fans on social media.

After the birth of her sons, Jasmine Campbell became aware of how much waste her young family was producing.

Eager to reduce her environmental footprint, the mother from North Lakes, 26 kilometres north of Brisbane CBD, started 'upcycling' furniture and accessories from leftover materials.

Ms Campbell now sells her wares on Modern Mila, a Facebook page that features inventive creations like stylish coffee tables fashioned out of recycled tyres.

The repurposed wheels - for which Ms Campbell charges $150 - are wrapped in woven twine and fitted with a sealed bottom and removable lid, creating a hidden storage space in the middle of the living room.

'Like all my upcycle projects I'm really quite passionate about these guys!' Ms Campbell posted on Facebook.

'It's so hard to get trendy furniture at a reasonable cost and made sustainably. Plus it comes with that additional storage space under the lid.'

Photos of the tables have already attracted attention on social media, with many tagging their friends and suggesting they buy one.

'I think seeing the tyre on the inside is like a hidden gem when you open the lid, you don't expect it!' one woman replied.

A second said 'amazing, what a great use of old tyres' while a third added: 'How clever!' 

'They look amazing, great job as usual,' said a fourth.

Not content with just one sustainable creation, Ms Campbell also uses the scraps leftover from her coffee tables to make indoor plant pots.

Other popular pieces on her Facebook page include soy wax candles hand-poured into discarded jars and earrings made from old denim.
