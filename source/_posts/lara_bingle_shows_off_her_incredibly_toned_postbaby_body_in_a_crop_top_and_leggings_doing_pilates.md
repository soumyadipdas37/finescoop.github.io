She welcomed her third son with husband Sam Worthington in June.

And on Tuesday, Lara Bingle showed off her incredibly toned post-baby body as she completed a gruelling Pilates workout at home. 

The 33-year-old shared videos of herself working out on Instagram, wearing leggings and a crop top to work up a sweat.

'The burn gets me every single time,' Lara captioned the post.

Earlier this month, Lara said that she would be taking on a three-week at-home challenge with Fluidform Pilates.    

Lara lives in Los Angeles with her husband, actor Sam Worthington, who is best known for playing Jake Sully in the Avatar film series.

Earlier this year, the notoriously private couple welcomed their third child, a boy whose name they haven't disclosed.

The pair, who are also parents to sons Rocket, four, and Racer, two, are yet to reveal when exactly their baby was born.

Lara had confirmed her pregnancy in November, telling Vogue Australia: 'I'm having a boy, early next year. It's my third boy and we're all very excited and very happy.

'I think any addition brings joy and happiness to the family, but more so when you can share it with the other boys. It's such a boy's club in my house!'

Lara and Sam began dating in 2013 and married in secret a year later.
