Ronald Koeman is reportedly unable to take charge of Barcelona in an official game leaving the club's plans for the new season in jeopardy.  

Cadena COPE in Spain reported on Wednesday night that while the Dutchman was unveiled by president Josep Maria Bartomeu earlier this summer as a replacement to Quique Setien, the necessary paperwork remains outstanding. 

Setien, according to the report, has not been officially sacked and a severance package between the former manager and the club has still to be agreed, leaving Koeman in limbo on the eve of their LaLiga opener against Villarreal later this month.
