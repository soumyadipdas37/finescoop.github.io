They've been keeping busy filming scenes for The Only Way Is Essex's 10th anniversary series, which is currently airing on ITVBe.

But aside from TV, Georgia Kousoulou and Tommy Mallett have quite the project on their hands as they're renovating their new mansion in the English county, which the businessman, 28, bought for his girlfriend of six years, 29, last month.

The reality stars have been updating fans about their extensive work on their special home Instagram account, where they've shared images of its current appearance as well as photos of homes that inspire them.

One of their four bathrooms currently features pale brown tiles, a traditional toilet and wash basin set up as well as a classic silver towel rail, but the pair are seeking to follow a marble and black colour scheme with sleek flooring and simplistic appliances. 

Meanwhile, their curved shower screen will be transformed into a wide pan barrier, which will stand alongside wall-hung toilet. 

An espresso-toned banister and matching furniture is set to be styled with light walls, taking their current hallway to the next level. 

The TV stars have gotten the ball rolling with their kitchen ideas too, with a column-designed kitchen being transformed into a more sociable, open plan space with bar stools, glitzy chandelier lights and matte grey finishings.

Despite purchasing the home just a few weeks ago, the duo have managed to get rid of the old kitchen by removing the flooring and matching compartments. The influencers hired builders to start digging the foundation for the new kitchen last week.

The media personalities - who first moved in together 18 months after embarking on a romance - also revealed that a part of their exterior will be extended, while a windowed wall will be knocked down to adhere to their open plan theme.   

Their social media activity came after Georgia hit out at former stars of the show who declined offers to return for the 10th anniversary episodes.

Over the past month, the ITVBe hit has marked a decade on air with a retrospective show which looked back on the best moments over the years, however original stars, including Mark Wright and Lucy Mecklenburgh, refused to appear. 

The former lovebirds, aged 33 and 29 respectively, insisted they have moved on with their lives, yet Georgia claimed their snub was disrespectful.

Speaking to The Sun, the blonde said: 'I think it is bad that some of the original cast decided not to do the anniversary special.

'I think everyone should have done it. TOWIE made you, so I think everyone should have done it to show respect to the show that made you. 

'Even if you don't want to film new episodes for the 10th anniversary series, the least you can do is the reunion show. Towie has given you the life you have now. I don't think you should ever forget'.

 Georgia joined the show's 11th edition six years ago, while her long-term partner signed up as a castmember two seasons later.
