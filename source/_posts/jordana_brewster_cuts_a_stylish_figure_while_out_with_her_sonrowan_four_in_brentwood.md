Jordana Brewster enjoyed some quality time with her four-year-old son, Rowan, at the Brentwood Country Mart in Los Angeles on Monday.  

As the 40-year-old actress put her effortlessly chic style on full display, she kept her dark tresses tied up into a sleek bun and wore a surgical mask over her nose and mouth.

While trekking around the sidewalk in a pair of baby blue sneakers, she carried her belongings in a large straw tote bag that she kept on her left arm.

Brewster and her husband of 13 years announced their 'amicable' split in July, after separating earlier this year.
