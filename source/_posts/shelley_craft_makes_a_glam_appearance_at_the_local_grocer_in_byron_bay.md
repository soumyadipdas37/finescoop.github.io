Shelley Craft turned heads when she headed out to a local grocer in Byron Bay on Tuesday.

The 44-year-old Block host looked very glam in a hot pink dress as she picked up some healthy treats in the laidback NSW coastal town. 

The normally smiley star appeared unusually stony-faced as she made a mad dash to the store.

Lady in pink! Shelley Craft stood out in Byron Bay in a bright pink dress while picking up healthy treats on Tuesday 

Shelley stunned in a pink ruffled dress paired with white Golden Goose sneakers featuring a leopard print star. 

She toted a small Louis Vuitton handbag and accessorised with a pair of yellow and tortoise shell sunglasses. 

Her cropped blonde locks were pulled back into a ponytail and she flaunted her natural beauty with minimal makeup.

Her purchases included a punnet of strawberries and a packet of locally produced Doña Cholita blue corn tortilla, as well as a packet of their white corn tortilla chips. 

The organic corn chips are made using all natural ingredients and are produced in Australia's first solar powered Tortilleria.

It comes after the media personality revealed the diet behind her trim physique.  

Last week she told New Idea she follows a fasting diet, only eating between midday and 6pm. 

'I find this gets my digestion working really well - it never feels like I'm fasting,' she said.
