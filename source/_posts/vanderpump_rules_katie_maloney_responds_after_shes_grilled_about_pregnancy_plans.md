Katie Maloney revealed she doesn't feel like the 'odd one out' on her Instagram, after a fan pointed out three of her current and former castmates are currently pregnant.   

On Thursday, the Vanderpump Rules star, 33, entered the comments of a fan page for the show, upon seeing a commentator excitedly exclaim they were 'ready for a baby announcement' from her and husband Tom Schwartz. 

After another fan chimed in that the podcast host must be feeling slightly left out, Maloney replied she has 'zero fomo' and is 'so happy' for her friends and is 'enjoying being along' during their journeys to motherhood.

'It will happen for us when it's right,' Maloney said of her and Schwartz's future baby plans. 'Sometimes it just takes time and doesn't always happen the first try.'  Her response was captured on the Comments By Bravo Instagram account. 

The pair, who married in 2016, previously admitted they 'talk a big game' about expanding their family, but Schwartz told UsWeekly the idea is still 'scary' in March.

Still, the 37-year-old says he has 'always' loved kids and doesn't 'want to be a rickety, old dad.'

'I want to be able to run around with my kid and throw him over my shoulder and play ball with him. Or her,' he noted the outlet, adding ideally they'd have two kids. 

Maloney's recent comments come after Brittany Cartwright, 31, and Jax Taylor, 41, revealed they're expecting earlier this week.

The couple - who tied the knot in June 2019 in Brittany's native Kentucky - told PEOPLE that they their baby is arriving in April 2021.
