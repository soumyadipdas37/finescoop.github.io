The TV star, 30, has plans to open several branches of the business, with Lord Sugar saying Greggs should 'watch out'. 

The Apprentice host looked in good spirits as he joined Carina at the store and helped her to cut the ribbon on its opening day. 

Speaking on Tuesday's episode of This Morning, Lord Sugar dismissed concerns about a potential second wave of coronavirus.

The host insisted society needs to return to normality and people need to return to their workplaces.

When questioned by Phillip Schofield about second wave concerns, he said: 'Excuse me, I am sick and tired of watching CNN, Sky, BBC, the lot. 

'All they do is cause panic. I’m not interested in any of this stuff. You can switch telly on anytime of the day and see more bad news, I’m not interested.

'You go down Whitehall, it’s like a ghost town. They only need half an excuse not to go to work, we’re paying for them by the way. 

'The thing about getting back to work, you don’t realise how many questions and answers go on. People ask simple questions. The interaction between people that goes on.'

Lord Sugar added a second wave has been a concern for several weeks and he pointed out that his employees are back in the office.

He said: 'The second wave is something that’s been discussed for a long time now. This government, who I sympathise with, can’t be seen to be doing anything right with anybody. 

'They’ve been given an unprecedented situation and we’re learning as we go along. Those people who still like working from home are a bit complacent honestly. My businesses, we’ve all come back.'

When asked about people who may be fearful of returning to work, Lord Sugar said: 'There’s a fine line of fearful or enjoying it.

Carina agreed, saying: 'I have exactly the same thoughts as Lord Sugar. We are social creatures and we need that interaction'

'What are they fearful of? My business, loads of people have been back for well over a month now.

'I’ve a factory down the road with 300 people in it who’ve been working all through the pandemic. We have systems in place, temperature taking.'

Speaking about supporting Carina's bakery business, he said: 'What attracted me to Carina as the winner is that this business has potential. Food will always be good. 

'I think Carina will concur that throughout this pandemic, the shop has been busy. It’s given us encouragement to open a second branch which was always on the cards. Greggs watch out, we’re going to have a lot of branches. 

'We have to get back to some form of normality. We all know what to do, the right things to do. Put all that in place and if people act sensibly, we can get back to normality.'
