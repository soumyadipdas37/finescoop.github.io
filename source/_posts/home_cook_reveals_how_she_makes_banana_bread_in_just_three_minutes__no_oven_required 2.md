A savvy home cook has shared an easy way to make banana bread in only three minutes - no oven required.

Ayeh, from Sydney, made a concise 20-second TikTok video explaining how to prepare the simple breakfast treat to her 167,000 followers.

The 'no bake' recipe is very easy to follow and it requires a mug. 

To make the bread, she used one ripe banana, honey, coconut oil, almond milk, oat flour, baking powder, cinnamon and topped with walnuts.

'It's more like a banana bread pudding, but it tastes so good,' Ayeh said.

She first smashed the ripe banana at the bottom of the mug using a fork, then added in the honey, coconut oil and almond milk and combined well.

She then added in the rest of the ingredients and mixed again for a second time before baking the 'bread' in the microwave on high for three minutes.

Most banana breads bake for 40 to 50 minutes in the oven, or until golden brown. 

The tasty meal would be ideal for those who are time poor or who are working from home and desire a warm breakfast.
