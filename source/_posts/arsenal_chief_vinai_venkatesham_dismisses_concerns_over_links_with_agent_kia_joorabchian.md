Arsenal chief Vinai Venkatesham has dismissed concerns about the club’s links with Kia Joorabchian, insisting it would be ‘a crazy strategy’ to let an agent influence their transfer policy.

Super-agent Joorabchian is close to Arsenal’s technical director Edu, though not his agent, and also the club’s former head of football Raul Sanllehi.

And eyebrows have been raised as the amount of work Arsenal have done with Joorabchian has increased.

Agent Kia Joorabchian represents David Luiz, Cedric Soares and summer arrival Willian

He represents David Luiz, Cedric Soares and summer arrival Willian, brokering their moves to the Emirates and new deals for the first pair, and also looks after Philippe Coutinho another player heavily linked with a move to Arsenal.

Venkatesham said: ‘I am glad you asked the question. I see, read and absorb a lot of what is being said about how we work with agents.

‘We don’t select players based on the identity of their agent.

‘We select players based on the position we need to strengthen and the characteristics we are looking for in a player and if the player is out there who meets those characteristics.

‘Who the agent is comes out at the end, once we have decided who the player is. We are not signing players based on the identity of the agent. That would be a crazy strategy.’
