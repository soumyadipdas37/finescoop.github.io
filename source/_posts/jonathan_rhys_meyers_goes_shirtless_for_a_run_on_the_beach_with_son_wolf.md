Jonathan tied the knot wife his wife Mara in 2016. The couple welcomed their first child later the same year.

Previously, Mara credited the Irish star for 'being a natural' when it comes to fatherhood in the months that followed Wolf's birth.

Now speaking to the Irish Independent, the Cork native, who was supporting 25 years of Irish children's charity Barretstown, explained that welcoming his first child has given him a new perspective on life.

He said: 'I'm much happier than I have ever been. Once you have your first child, you become the past. We're all busy giving out to ourselves and driving ourselves forward. A child gives you a new perspective on life.'

Aside from discussing fatherhood, the Bend It Like Beckham actor got his start in acting aged just 16 after a casting agent spotted him in a pool hall in Cork while looking for boys to star in Irish film classic, The War of The Buttons.

Jonathan's battle with alcoholism has been well documented over the years and he is believed to have had six stints in rehab - first checking into a rehab centre in Malibu in 2005 seeking treatment for alcohol abuse, before returning two years later in 2007.
