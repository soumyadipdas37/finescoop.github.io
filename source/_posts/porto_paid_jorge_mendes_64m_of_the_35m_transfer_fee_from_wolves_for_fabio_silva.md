Porto have informed the Portuguese stock exchange they will pay Jorge Mendes' Gestifute agency £6.4m out of the £35m transfer fee they received from Wolves for Fabio Silva.

The Premier League outfit completed the mega-money move for the 18-year-old attacker last week, setting a new club record for a transfer fee in the process.

Now, according to a number of reports in Portugal on Thursday, it has emerged that some of that money will make its way to Mendes, even though he is not Silva's agent.

Some of that money is going to Gestifute agency that is run by super agent Jorge Mendes 

The 18-year-old is represented by the company Soccer Talents Vision (STV), who were alongside him when he put pen to paper on a five-year deal with Wolves.

Fosun International, the company that own Wolves, have previously said that Mendes is an advisor at the club. 

Manager Nuno is represented by Mendes' Gestifute company, as well as a number of players. Rui Patricio, Joao Moutinho, Ruben Neves, Diogo Jota, Pedro Neto and Raul Jimenez are also signed to Gestifute.

Matt Doherty, the former Wolves right-back, also switched from his agent to Gestifute while at Wolves, according to The Times back in January.

Silva could make his debut for Wolves against Sheffield United on September 14

Doherty left Wolves for Tottenham earlier this month and Tottenham's manager, Jose Mourinho, is also represented by Mendes.

Mendes' influence stretches throughout football but it clearly runs particularly deep at Wolves. 

Wolves start the Premier League season on Monday, away to Sheffield United where Silva could make his debut.
