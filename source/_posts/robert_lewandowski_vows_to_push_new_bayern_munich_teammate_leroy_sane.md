Robert Lewandowski has vowed to constantly push new Bayern Munich team-mate Leroy Sane in training to ensure he fulfills his undoubted potential.

The 24-year-old moved back to his native Germany this summer after completing a £55million transfer from Manchester City. 

Sane fell out of favour under Pep Guardiola at City and looked likely to leave the club before suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the Community Shield over 12 months ago.

He couldn't work his way back into Guardiola's plans when fit again and was keen to leave the Premier League club.

Now he has the chance to start afresh in his homeland and, although his quality is there for all to see, Lewandowski has promised to help Sane realise his potential. 

'I want to push him hard in every single training to make him realise what he doesn't know he has,' the Polish striker said during a media Zoom call on Tuesday.

'I want him to work harder to show something special because he's an amazing guy and I think with him we can play another tactical system very well.

'That's why I see his massive potential and in my experience you have to push these players to make them play better and better.

'I know he has huge talent and if you work hard and train at 100 per cent then you will become a better player.'

After an extremely short summer break Bayern Munich begin their 2020-21 Bundesliga campaign against Schalke on Friday night.

It comes after they completed a memorable treble last season by beating Paris-Saint Germain in the Champions League final on August 23.

They thrashed Barcelona 8-2 in the quarter-finals, prompting a mass overhaul at the Nou Camp.

Speaking about that game, Lewandowski claims his team-mates were always confident they would beat Lionel Messi and Co. 

He said: 'Before the Barcelona game we were talking about how we were feeling and we felt we were very strong before we got to Portugal.

'I spoke with one player and he said "we are going to win 5-1". I said "okay, that would be great". We knew we were the strongest team and playing well.

'It didn't matter how many goals we had scored we wanted more. Everyone here knew we could win the Champions League this time and then it happened.'

Bayern are favourites to retain the Bundesliga in the upcoming campaign, despite the threat of a promising Borussia Dortmund team spearheaded by Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho.

There is also huge fixture congestion to deal with caused by the delayed start to the season and Lewandowski is wary of the challenges that lay ahead for Hansi Flick's side. 

'We know next season will be the most difficult of our lives for every club,' the 32-year-old, who scored 55 goals in  47 appearances last season, added.

'We have games every three days without a break.

'That will be difficult and we have to be ready not only for the game but also with our bodies and physical things.

'It is going to be something we've never had in our lives. I don't know what kind of goals I can set.

'I just want to play my best and score as many goals as I can. First place is always the team's goal.'
