She's been a beautiful beach babe as much as possible this summer, but on Friday she took some time to catch up on errands. 

Alessandra Ambrosio was seen picking up lunch and stopping by the bank ahead of the weekend in Brentwood, California, wearing her workout clothes. 

The Brazilian supermodel, 39, donned a white t-shirt with blue insignia on the breast pocket, along with her Alo black biker short leggings.

Ambrosio had her hair in a messy high ponytail held up by a scrunchie, and she stayed protected from COVID-19 with a tan face mask.  

She walked around in black flip flops as she went to pick up lunch at Farmshop in the Brentwood Country Mart.

She checked her smartphone, which hung from a red cross-body strap.

The mother-of-two's tee featured a colorful wave illustration on the back.

Alessandra's fresh-looking red manicure and pedicure shined brightly in the afternoon California sun. 

The 5ft9in catwalker's figure was on full display in her shorts as she got back in her large black SUV before driving away.

Alessandra, founder of the Gal Floripa swimwear line, has populated her Instagram feed with loads of summer-appropriate imagery, showing her in one of her favorite settings – by the sea.

On Wednesday, Ambrosio was seen soaking in a gorgeous sunset during the golden hour in Malibu.

The longtime Victoria's Secret Angel was snapping photos and taking quick video of the sunset as she walked through the sand and frolicked a few feet into the ocean water.

And the results were later seen on her feed, showing Alessandra happy and in her element as she admired the gorgeous end to the day.

Over the summer months, the Amazonian beauty has made a habit of playing beach volleyball with friends and family whenever she finds the time.

Ambrosio has been quarantining at her home in Brentwood during the COVID-19 pandemic with her two children, daughter Anja, 12, and son Noah, eight, whom she shares with her former fiancé Jamie Mazur.
