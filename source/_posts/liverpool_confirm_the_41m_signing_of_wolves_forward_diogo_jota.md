Liverpool have confirmed the £41million signing of Wolves forward Diogo Jota.

The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the Merseyside club after it emerged on Friday they had agreed a fee with Wolves.

The Portuguese forward arrives as part of an impressive double swoop for the Reds after confirming the £25m signing of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich on Friday.

'It's just a really exciting moment for me and my family,' he told Liverpoolfc.com upon sealing the transfer on Saturday.

'All of my path since I was a kid and now, to join a club like Liverpool – the world champions – is just unbelievable. I just want to get started.

'It is one of the best teams in the world – the best at the moment because they are world champions. When you look at the Premier League, you always see Liverpool as one of the biggest teams in the country, so it's impossible to say no.

'So we just want to come [here], to give our best and hopefully I can become a good option for Liverpool in the future.'







He will wear the number 20 for the Reds, taking over from Adam Lallana who signed for Brighton this summer.

The signing of the talented forward adds strength in depth to their prolific forward line after some raised doubts about Klopp's back up options as they look to defend their crown.

Jota has long been admired by Klopp with his pace and attacking threat bringing 16 goals for himself last season and countless chances for others.

The Portuguese leaves the Midlands club after three successful seasons as an integral part of Nuno Espirito Santo's side that achieved promotion from the Championship and a run to the semi-final of the Europa League. 

He was omitted from the Wolves squad for the Carabao Cup defeat by Stoke City on Thursday night, having been an unused substitute for the win over Sheffield United in the Premier League on Monday. 

Meanwhile, Wolves have a player coming the other way after confirming the £10m signing of highly-rated defender Ki-Jana Hoever.





 The signing adds to the £25m capture of Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara

Hoever adds to a lively summer for Wolves, who have already broken their club record fee to capture Fabio Silva from Porto for £36m. The club have also signed Vitinha on-loan from the Portuguese club, Marcal and Matija Sarkic this summer. 

Liverpool switched their attentions to Jota, having initially spoken to Watford about signing Ismaila Sarr.

Relegated Watford, however, were looking for a fee in excess of £50m for the Senegal forward. 

Liverpool's game against Chelsea on Sunday appears too soon for their new forward, but it could see the debut of fellow new boy Thiago.
