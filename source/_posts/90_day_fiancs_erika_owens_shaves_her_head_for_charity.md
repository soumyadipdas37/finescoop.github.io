Her multi-coloured hair made her one of the breakout stars of 90 Day Fiancé's Before The 90 Days.

But now Erika Owens has shaved off her signature locks to raise money for the Cancer Council.

In videos and photos shared to social media this week, the 24-year-old had her hair shaved off to a very short crop.

'New hair, same old me!' Australian 90 Day Fiancé star Erika Owens shaved her head to raise money for the Cancer Council 

She then had the remaining fuzz dyed a bright neon yellow.

Posing for a post haircut photo on Instagram, Erika wrote: 'New hair, same old me.

'It feels f***ing great to say good bye to this chapter of my life but it feels even better that we’re less than $3000AUD until we reach my $10,000 goal for the Cancer Council! Please consider donating even if it is just a few dollars - it all counts!!'

She added: 'I am continuing to fund raise for another few weeks with some super fun things planned - I won’t stop until we fly past that $10k goal! 

'Biggest love and thank you to everyone who has donated and supported both me and Cancer Council.'

Erika starred on the most recent season of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days.
