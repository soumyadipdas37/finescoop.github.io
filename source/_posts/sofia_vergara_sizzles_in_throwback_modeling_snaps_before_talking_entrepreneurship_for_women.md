She recently shared a throwback video of herself while blonde in a string bikini.

And on Thursday, Sofia Vergara shared two more sultry snaps from the nineties.

The stunning TV star, 48, showcased her flat midriff and her ample cleavage in a plunging black bathing suit and a barely-there string bikini.

Her snaps comes after she sat down to talk about the importance of entrepreneurship for women during a Time100 Talks virtual interview. 

Wow: Sofia Vergara shared two more sultry snaps from the nineties on Thursday

The beauty captioned '#tbt Miami Beach,' adding '#The 90's.'

Sofia showed off her curves in a string white and chain hardware while posing next to a palm tree with her caramel and blonde highlighted.

In the second image, Sofia donned a low-cut one-piece that highlighted her chest area, with her tresses blowing back behind her.

Her snaps comes as her Time100 Talks was published with TIME reporter Raisa Bruner and Kiva CEO Neville Crawley.

Sofia launched a partnership with Kiva in the spring; Kiva is a global micro-finance nonprofit to support their COVID-19 response fund.

When asked why it's important to her: 'I've always supported and believed in micro-finance I've seen the impact that providing small business loans to marginalized communities can help, especially women owned businesses.'

'It gives them the resources that they need to afford education and medical needs,' she said. 'It was great partnering with Kiva because it allows this global fund and they have all the experience that we need for this - and all the resources.' 

She noted that 'it was preferred to support minority and female entrepreneurs.'

The Modern Family actress said it is important to empower the women 'to create their own income.' 

Sofia added that the nonprofit focuses on the people who are in trouble due to the economic impact of COVID-19.

On why entrepreneurship is important: 'Personally I feel like it liberates you when you're able to control you're income and usually women are the ones that - they don't spend their money on partying and alcohol. They spend it on their family. Helping their kids, helping the family - so I think it's super important to help them because I think it spreads more.'

Adding: 'I feel like women have a lot to give and personally I love that Kiva does that.'

Last week, the ageless beauty shared another racy throwback video, this time while blonde in a tiny purple bikini.

Sofia rocked golden tresses in the clip; she is actually a natural blonde.
