The EFL have appealed against the decision by an independent panel to clear Derby County of breaching spending rules relating to their valuation of Pride Park.

The Championship club escaped a points deduction after charges over the £80million sale of their stadium and the assigning of players a residual transfer value at the end of their contracts were dismissed by a three-person tribunal.

The dropping of the charges is a blow to the EFL who won an independent tribunal against Sheffield Wednesday which led to the Owls receiving a 12-point deduction. 

The EFL have appealed against an independent panel dropping charges against Derby County 

A statement from the league said: 'The EFL Board has determined the League will appeal against the outcome of an independent Disciplinary Commission in respect of misconduct charges brought against Derby County. 

'The appeal is specific to the second charge only, which considered the Club’s policy regarding the amortisation of intangible assets. 

'There will be no further comment at this time.'

Derby's case relates to the valuation of Pride Park when owner Mel Morris sold the ground to another of his companies for £80m last year despite it previously being listed as worth £41m, a sale which enabled the club to comply with the EFL's spending rules by limiting their losses.

Derby were subjected to two charges from the EFL but both have been dismissed by a panel 

A second charge over how Derby measure the value of players — called amortisation — in their accounts was also dismissed, although the panel did conclude that 'the wording of the amortisation policy in Derby's financial statements could have been clearer'.

Most clubs spread the transfer fee they have paid for a player over the life of his contract, valuing their worth at £0 at the end of their deal.

However, Derby have assigned a residual value since 2015 which has boosted their accounts.  

The EFL are also facing calls to remove Derby County CEO Stephen Pearce from the league's board over the misconduct.
