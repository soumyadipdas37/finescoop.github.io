Jesinta Franklin was relaxed and happy as she spent time with her newborn daughter Tullulah after returning home from work on Monday.

The model, 28, shared an adorable photo to Instagram, cradling her seven-month-old baby girl after visiting a Sydney school and reading to the children.

In the photo, Jesinta wore a black crop top and white buttoned shirt as she carried her daughter and enjoyed a stroll.

The mother-of-one also wore sunglasses and let her natural beauty shine, opting to wear a neutral palette of makeup for the outing with Tullulah.

'And home to my angel,' she captioned the sweet picture.

Earlier in the day, Jesinta visited Gawura School, a school for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Sydney's CBD.

The 28-year-old shared a video to Instagram while reading to the young children and wrote: 'Highlight of my day'.

After visiting the Sydney school, Jesinta posed for a photo shoot for Crown Sydney ahead of its opening in December.

Meanwhile, the Australian model first returned to work in May, three months after giving birth to her daughter.

The 28-year-old revealed on Instagram she was getting up in the early hours of the morning for what appeared to be a project with Olay skincare.

The former Miss Universe Australia posted a video getting herself ready for her busy day and expressing milk for Tullulah so her AFL star husband Lance 'Buddy' Franklin could feed the newborn throughout the day.

'So, I am slowly easing back into work today and tomorrow and then next week is quite a big week for me work wise,' she explained.

'But I am up very early. If mum life has taught me anything its if you are prepared and organised it makes everything run so much more smooth.'
