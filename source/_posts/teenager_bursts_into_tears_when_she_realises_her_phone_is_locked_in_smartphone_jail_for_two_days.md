A teenage daughter in the US experienced a roller coaster of emotions when she realized she had accidentally locked her phone in smartphone 'jail' for two days.

The girl's brother had locked her phone inside the box for 40 minutes as a joke. 

But when she attempts to get it out, she dramatically increases the time.

A hilarious video filmed in the family kitchen captures her mixed reaction to her own mistake.

Captions on the video posted on TikTok explain that the girl's dad got a 'phone jail' for his birthday.

A 'phone jail' is similar to a safe but is operated by a timer, that only releases whats inside after a delegated period of time.  

The timer is operated by turning the dial on the lid to choose the desired 'jail' time.
