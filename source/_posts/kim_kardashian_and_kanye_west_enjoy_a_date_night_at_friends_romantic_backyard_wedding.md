Kim Kardashian shut down rumours of an impending divorce from her husband Kanye West on Saturday, as the pair reunited to attend their friends' wedding.

The 39-year-old TV personality took to her Instagram Stories to share snaps and footage from the romantic backyard celebration.

And as she shared details from the nuptials, including a snap of herself enjoying a 'rare' cocktail', the mother-of-four posted in an image of her and 43-year-old Kanye's footwear, adding the caption: 'Date night.'

The pair's loved-up outing firmly put to bed renewed rumours that Kim was on the verge of filing for divorce from her husband of six years.

Kim didn't show her famous husband's face while sharing footage from the outdoor gathering, with only his shoes making a cameo in the social media uploads.

Throughout the night, the reality star jammed to some Frank Sinatra and indulged in a decadent gourmet meal.

'It's a rare night that I have a drink,' wrote Kardashian as she documented the entire celebration on her Instagram Story.

First, she captured a picture of her first delicious drink for the night, which was a deep shade of pink and featured a citrus garnish. 

The snapshot also showcased Kim's black espadrille inspired heels and her iridescent designer handbag.

In a follow up photo, the KKW Beauty founder placed her drink on the ground and posed next to her musician-turned-designer husband Kanye.

Kanye had previously spent some time in nearby Jamaica before flying over to Haiti.

The rapper landed at Hugo Chávez International Airport in Cap-Haïtien in the country's northern area, where he ran into tennis star Naomi Osaka, the Miami Herald reported.

He was met there by President Jovenel Moise, who gave him a tour of the island.

Kanye was pictured in Instagram videos enjoying the music and dancing at one celebrating, though it wasn't clear if it was thrown in his honor.

He tried to capture the action on his phone, before getting up to join the dancers. 

Kanye was dressed casually for the get-together in a white graphic shirt and black track pants with thick beige stripes running down the legs.

Another video showed him freestyling a rap while surrounded by a crowd.

He appeared to have joined a group of drummers and flautists, though his bars couldn't be understood in the short clip.

He had his phone in front of him, possibly to read off existing lyrics.

The Monster rapper didn't mention his reasons for visiting Haiti, but he did share twitter posts on Saturday indicating he was interested in the country because of its history of overthrowing French colonialists. 

'Haiti is where our people started the first revolution that freed us from slavery,' he wrote in one tweet that included a paint of Haitians battling the French.

Shortly afterward, he posted another tweet with a photo of his own showing a crowd of people gawking at him.

'WE ARE HERE TO COMPLETE THE REVOLUTION,' he wrote. 'WE ARE ARE BUILDING THE FUTURE.'

However, Haiti’s Tourism Ministry announced that the musician would be visiting a plant breeding center in the northwest part of the island that was being launched by the president.

He was also expected to stop by the port of Labadee and Tortuga Island. 

Kanye was only accompanied by his entourage on the trip.

Last week, sources told Us Weekly that Kim was 'deeply disappointed and sad' because of her husband's ongoing mental health issues.

'Being isolated and alone essentially in his head isn’t healthy for Kanye,' an insider said.

They confirmed that the producer hadn't been adhering to the care plane that he and Kim agreed on, though she 'isn't surprised' by that development and partly blames it on the ongoing pandemic.

Although she was able to overlook his erratic tweets, it was 'the mood swings and the manic episodes [that] are extremely difficult for Kim to help Kanye cope with.'

Kanye had previously been staying isolated at his Wyoming ranch, and after taking a family vacation he's gone back to traveling on his own. 

The couple share four children: North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, 16 months.
