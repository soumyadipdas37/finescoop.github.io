Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder has jokingly told Gareth Bale to stay in Madrid because he doesn't want to face the Wales star in the Premier League.

Bale could be on his way back to Tottenham Hotspur with the London club in negotiations with Real Madrid over a sensational return.

And Wilder clearly appreciates the winger's qualities, believing even at 31 he has the ability to terrorise opposition defenders.

Gareth Bale could be on the verge of a sensational return to Tottenham from Real Madrid 

Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder jokingly urged Bale to stay in Madrid and play golf

He said: 'I said it when we came into the Premier League and there was talk about Eden Hazard going to Real Madrid. I said I'd give him a taxi to the airport!

'Hopefully Gareth stays in Madrid, it's a lovely place and there are some lovely golf courses... don't make it any harder for us!

'I'm not surprised he wants to come and play in the Premier League. We've had some great experiences and a lot of Spurs fans will want it to happen.

'I can't imagine there are many Sheffield United fans hoping that happens, though, because it just gives us another challenge.'

The Blades don't face Tottenham until January 16, at Bramall Lane, with the return fixture scheduled for May 1.

The Wales star's love of golf is well known and he often enjoys playing on the courses of Madrid

The Wales star spent six seasons at Spurs before a world record £86m move to Real in 2013

By that time, Bale could be back in the groove as a Tottenham player with the north London club in pole position ahead of Manchester United to bring him back to England.

Bale has fallen out of favour at Real and the Spanish club are even willing to pay half of his £500,000-a-week wages to facilitate his Bernabeu exit.

Even if Tottenham only have to pay Bale £250,000-a-week, he would still be the club's highest earner. 

Despite helping Real win four Champions League titles during his seven years with the club, Bale has been criticised heavily by fans and the Spanish media in recent years.

Bale's relationship with Real manager Zinedine Zidane has become increasingly frosty

Bale caused a storm of criticism when he posed with a 'Wales. Golf Madrid. In that order' flag

His love of golf and time he spends on the courses of Madrid has been one source of criticism with his Real team-mates nicknaming him 'The Golfer.'

Fans weren't impressed when Bale posed with a Welsh flag with the words 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order' after they secured qualification for Euro 2020 last November.
