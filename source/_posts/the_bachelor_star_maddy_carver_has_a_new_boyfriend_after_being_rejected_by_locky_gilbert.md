She failed to find love with Locky Gilbert on The Bachelor. 

But on Thursday, Maddy Carver revealed that since leaving the Channel 10 dating show, she has found her perfect man. 

Appearing on HIT radio program, Jimmy & Nath, the 25-year-old admitted that she is no longer single.

'I am seeing someone, I am loved-up now,' she said. 

'We have known each other for about six years and we went on a date six years ago and we didn't click at all. Then we caught back up and this time something just clicked and it feels right.'  

While she didn't share the name of her new beau, the reality star did reveal that he works as an accounts manager. 

Maddy, who was rejected by Locky after failing to receive a single date or group date, also divulged her thoughts on his relationship with winner Irena Srbinovska

Maddy, who was rejected by Locky after failing to receive a single date or group date, also divulged her thoughts on his relationship with winner Irena Srbinovska. 

The school teacher said she believes Locky and Irena's relationship is genuine, but admitted she 'can't see them getting married'. 

'Locky had all these girls' attention inside the mansion,' Maddy reasoned.

'It would be really hard to go back to life just having one girl, don't you think?' she added.

During last week's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Irena Srbinovska and rival Bella Varelis he had fallen in love with them - leading both to believe they had won his heart.

But ultimately, it was down to earth nurse Irena, 31, who stole the burly adventure man's heart - leaving Bella, 25, completely devastated.
