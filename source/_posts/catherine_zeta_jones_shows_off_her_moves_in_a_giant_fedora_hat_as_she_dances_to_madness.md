And on Wednesday, the Bugsy Malone star appeared in a sentimental mood as she uploaded a snap of the youngsters before they head back to school.

In the photo, a fresh-faced Carys rests her arm and chin on her brother's back, while a shirtless Dylan gives a straight faced look at the camera. 

'Summer officially over in our family,' she wrote in the caption. 'Today both our young adults go back to studying.' 

She went on to comment on the new ways schools are coping with the pandemic usually in online or staggered ways.

She told her kids, Dylan who attends Brown University, and Carys who is still in high school just turning 17-years-old in April, 'I love you both.' 

The Mask of Zorro actress sent a message saying: 'and to all kids out there. Knowledge is the key to life. So battle through. This too shall pass.' 

Catherine shares both of her children with her husband of nearly 20 years, Michael Douglas, 75, who was recently nominated for two Emmy's for acting and producing in Netflix's The Kominsky Method.

Catherine, Michael and Carys recently enjoyed a vacation in Mallorca, Spain, in August. 

The couple will reach their 20-year milestone on November 18, and in a recent interview with PEOPLE Magazine, the Welsh actress revealed it will be a strictly socially-distanced affair due to coronavirus. 

'We won't be doing any great big party,' Catherine tells the publication. 'Not that I'm a big party fan anyway. It would be nice to get all our friends together in one space, but we're not doing that until we're completely out of the woods. 

'So I will raise my mask and let my husband passionately kiss me, then I will put it firmly back on.'
