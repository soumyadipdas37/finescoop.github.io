Married At First Sight star's Jules Robinson and Cam Merchant are set to welcome their first child in the coming weeks. 

And, the couple have decided not to learn the gender of their baby ahead of the birth.  

But, that didn't stop Jules from playing an unusual game at her baby shower on Saturday, to predict the sex of their little one. 

Old wives tale: Cam Merchant and Jules Robinson (pictured) decided not to learn the gender of their baby ahead of the birth, but, that didn't stop Jules from playing an unusual game at her baby shower on Saturday, which is meant to predict the sex

Posting to her Instagram, the 36-year-old shared a video that featured her testing out an old wives tales known as the ring gender test. 

'It's a GIIRL! it's a BOY! Nothing like some white witch magic at your #babyshower,' she captioned the clip. 

In the video Jules was laying on the couch and someone dangled a ring over her burgeoning bump and it began to move in loops.

A guest explained this implies she was expecting a boy: 'Back and forth in a straight line is a girl, circles is a boy.'  

However, Jules later shared a screenshot of a website revealing that they got it wrong and loops implies a girl.

I guess we will just have to wait a few more weeks to find out whether there is any truth to the method.

Meanwhile, Cam says the couple have already picked out a name for the baby, if their bundle of joy should be a girl.

He said they decided during filming their season of MAFS in 2018.

The SodaStream brand spokesperson, 36, told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday: 'I mentioned it to Jules when we first brought up kids, and she loved it and we have gone with it.'
