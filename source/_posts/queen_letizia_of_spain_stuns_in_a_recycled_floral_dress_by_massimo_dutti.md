Queen Letizia of Spain has once again proved she is the champion of the high street as she stepped out today in a beautiful floral outfit from Massimo Dutti.

The mother-of-two, 47, wore the stylish dress when attending a meeting in Madrid, with the Spanish Association Against Cancer, of which Letizia is honorary president.

Putting safety first, the royal teamed her shirt frock with a face mask and showcased her slender frame by drawing in her waist with a thin black belt.

Letizia first sported the recycled ensemble - which cost just under £100 - back in July 2019 while attending the UNICEF Spanish Committee Awards.

But instead of pairing her outfit with matching court shoes like last time around, Letizia highlighted her graceful physique with navy high heels.

The monarch perfectly clashed varying shades of navy, with both her choice of shoes and an envelope clutch bag.

The former journalist wore her glossy brunette hair in a relaxed style and completed the look with soft pink eyeshadow.

She kept the look formal with minimal jewellery, aside from a pair of dazzling and dainty silver earrings. 

Yesterday, Letizia once again showcased her love for a high street bargain, with the royal sporting a recycled £70 tweed dress from Zara.

The mother-of-two opted for the trendy checked number at an event to mark the nation's Cooperative's Day at Madrid's Palacio de Viana, alongside her husband King Felipe.

The Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC) is Letizia's first permanent honorary presidency, and she actively participates in the work of the association.

She has proven herself to be committed to the fight against cancer and has led the efforts to reduce the impact caused by the disease on people's lives in Spain. 

The Spanish Association Against Cancer funds research projects and supports patients and their families.

Letizia married King Felipe of Spain in 2004 at Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid.

The relationship began in November 2002 and in 2003, just months after she had been promoted to the position of anchor on the national news channel, she quit her job and days later the royal engagement was announced.
