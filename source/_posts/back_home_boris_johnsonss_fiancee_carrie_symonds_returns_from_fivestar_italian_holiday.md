Carrie Symonds has arrived back in chilly Britain after enjoying a luxury seaside retreat to Italy with baby Wilfred. 

Boris Johnson's fiancée battled the blustery weather in a red beanie hat as she left Downing Street by the back exit this afternoon.

Earlier in the week MailOnline revealed Ms Symonds, 32, to be relaxing in the exclusive resort of Lake Como with three girlfriends at the £600-a-night Grand Hotel Tremezzo.

There, she was pictured strolling along the promenade with four-month-old Wilfred and cruising around the coast on a boat trip.

But she returns to choppy political waters in Westminster as the Prime Minister faces a backbench revolt over the Government's coronavirus emergency powers.  

Carrie Symonds has arrived back in chilly England after enjoying a luxury seaside retreat to Italy with baby Wilfred. Boris Johnson's fiancée battled the blustery weather in a red beanie hat as she left Downing Street by the back exit this afternoon

Carrie Symonds, 32, was seen strolling along a waterfront promenade with a friend while carrying son Wilfred in a baby sling 

Ms Symonds, a former Conservative Party communications director, complemented her striking bobble hat with an autumnal yellow jumper as she left Downing Street via the exit which backs on to St James' Park. 

During her luxury getaway the new mother was seen cutting a casual figure in a £325 blue checked cotton gingham dress by Ganni and black Superga trainers as she wandered along the waterside esplanade with a friend while carrying four-month-old Wilfred in a baby sling.    

A British holidaymaker told MailOnline: 'Carrie seemed very relaxed. She was smiling and laughing with her friends. It was as if she didn't have a care in the world.' 

Mr Johnson's fiancée didn't appear to have any worries as she enjoyed her holiday at a hotel which is considered one of the finest in Europe, popular with wealthy Americans. 

As the Prime Minister was addressing the nation on Tuesday night to spell out tough new restrictions which will close pubs and restaurants at 10pm, his fiancée was enjoying a late night supper with her three friends. 

She stayed up until well after 10pm as she ate at the hotel restaurant where Mediterranean-style sea bass with tomatoes, capers and Taggia olives costs £28.

Carrie appeared to share a joke with her female friend as she looked at her phone while the friend adjusted Wilfred's hair 

Carrie and her friends used the hotel’s £300-an-hour launch to see the various castles, stately homes and waterside villages that have made this Alpine location one of the world’s most prestigious holiday destinations

Carrie was seen wearing a £325 blue checked gingham dress, black canvas shoes, with her blonde hair tied up in a bun as she strolled with her son. After their stroll, the friends were seen enjoying a late night supper at an exclusive hotel

Carrie and her friends were seated on the terrace at an outside table. The tables were spaced apart in line with appropriate social distancing. The waiters and all hotel staff were wearing masks. Guests are also required to wear masks in the public areas of the hotel and can only remove them when eating and drinking.

Before dinner the Prime Minister's partner strolled along the promenade where she was able to take off her mask outside, taking in the view with Wilfred dressed in a red and white baby grow.

Boris's son, with his distinctive shock of blonde hair like his father, took a lively interest in the scenery before dozing in his sling.

The onlooker said: 'It's such a beautiful hotel, I'm not surprised that she was having a good time.

'It was a surprise to see her on holiday, particularly as we are in the grip of a pandemic.

'You notice it even if you are on holiday.

'The waiters and other staff wear face masks all the time. In the whole of the country they are being very strict.' 

Carrie smiled and chatted to her female friend while the group and baby Wilfred too a boat road during her Lake Como stay

The new mother wore a red gingham dress, navy woolen cardigan and black canvas shoes while baby Wilfred wore a red trousers, a red-stripped top, white socks and a bright orange sun hat for their two-hour boat ride
