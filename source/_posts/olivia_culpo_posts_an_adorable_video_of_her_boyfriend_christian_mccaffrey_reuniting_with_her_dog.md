After spending a weekend away, Olivia Culpo and her adorable dog Oliver Sprinkles reunited with her boyfriend Christian McCaffrey.

Culpo, 28, shared the video on Instagram of her returning home, after planning her sister's baby shower over the weekend, of an excited McCaffrey, 24, reuniting with the dog.

McCaffrey, a running back for the NFL's Carolina Panthers, has been rehabbing a high ankle sprain he suffered last week, which is expected to keep him out for four to six weeks of the NFL season, as he was seen with a wrap around his ankle.

Culpo is seen walking down a hallway holding her tiny dog, before she puts him down as he goes running to the running back, who screams 'Ollie!'

She dated Amendola for over three years intermittently between February 2016 and April 2019.

She was previously linked to another NFL star, Tim Tebow, in 2015, after she split with Nick Jonas, who she dated from 2013 to 2015.

Culpo entered the Miss Rhode Island pageant, her first beauty competition ever, which she won in 2012, before winning Miss USA at just 20 years of age.

Later that year she won the Miss Universe pageant, the last American woman to do so and the first since Brooke Lee in 1997.

She has since amassed a huge social media following and has modeled for several brands, most recently being featured on the cover of the 2020 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.
