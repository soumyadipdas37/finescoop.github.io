Newcastle United have announced the signing of Ryan Fraser, with the former Bournemouth winger completing a medical on Monday. 

The 26-year-old arrives at St James' Park on a free transfer and has signed a five-year deal following the expiry of his Cherries contract.

The Scotland international has been without a club since June after he refused to play for Bournemouth upon the restart of the Premier League season.





Fraser registered 24 goals and 33 assists in 208 Bournemouth appearances after joining the south coast club form Aberdeen in January 2013. 

He won the League 1 title in his first season in England and helped the Cherries win the Championship crown in 2014-15, going on to represent the club in the top flight.

After completing his mve to Newcastle. Fraser told the club's official website: 'I'm absolutely buzzing for it - I came down to see the place the other day and it was all just good things; the manager, the place, the fans, the messages I've been getting.





'It was just a no-brainer, really, to play in such a big stadium with such passionate fans, and being back up in the north again is big as well.

'So I'm really looking forward to it and I just cant wait to show everyone what I can do, help the team and help us get back to where we belong.'

Fraser will reunite with former Cherries team-mate Callum Wilson after he too signed for the Magpies on Monday. 

Newcastle agreed to pay an £18million fee for the striker which could rise to £20m.
