Just hours after fans were in an uproar over Big Brother All Stars housemate Memphis Garrett seemingly calling Black housemate David Alexander an N-word, CBS claims he did not utter the derogatory term.

During an after-hours live-feed of Big Brother on Wednesday night, Garrett, a 37-year-old Tennessee native, was have a private conversation with Cody Calafiore, 29.

They were both talking about David Williams, a Black 30-year-old from Atlanta, when Memphis said, 'Dude, David is a ni-' before stopping himself, with a CBS statement claiming Garrett never said the N-word.

'The producers have listened to the scene using enhanced audio,' the statement from CBS began.

'Additionally, the Network’s program practices team isolated and played back the scene several different ways using professional, studio-grade audio equipment. After close examination, it has been determined a racial epithet was not said or uttered,' the statement continued.

'Hate speech will not be tolerated, and those who violate the policy will be removed from the Big Brother House,' the statement concluded.

Regardless of CBS' statement, fans aren't convinced, with some going so far as to start a Change.org petition to evict Memphis. 

The petition currently has over 3,300 signatures (with a goal of 5,000 signatures), which includes a number of tweets from fans who believe that Memphis was going to say the N-word but stopped himself short.

The Unfiltered Feedsters Twitter shared a video of the incident, adding, 'Let’s also clarify everyone has been drinking tonight.....Memphis couldn’t hold his tongue.'

Another Twitter user, @jadajeanmister, added, 'it was only a matter of time before we caught it on the feeds #bb22.'

The petition also included videos of Memphis saying other racial slurs like 'coon a**es' and walking with his arm around David in a very menacing fashion.
