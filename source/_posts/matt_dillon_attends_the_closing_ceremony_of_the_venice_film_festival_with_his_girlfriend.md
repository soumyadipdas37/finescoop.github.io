Roberta looked sensational in a white sleeveless dress with an embroidered detail and a plunging neckline.

Though the event is still taking place, it is a markedly toned down affair to previous years amid the coronavirus crisis, with temperature checks and mask wearing becoming mandatory. 

Matt joined writer-director Veronika Franz, UK writer-director Joanna Hogg, writer Nicola Lagioia, German filmmaker Christian Petzol and French star Lucivine Sagnier on the Festival's main competition jury, which is presided over by actress Cate Blanchett. 

The actor rose to prominence in the late '80s with roles in films such as the Outsiders and Rumble Fix.

In 2006, he received Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for his critically-acclaimed role in Crash opposite Sandra Bullock.

Since then, he has gone on to star in dozens of films including the gruesome flick The House That Jack built in 2018.
