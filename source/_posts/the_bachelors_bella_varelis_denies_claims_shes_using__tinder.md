The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has denied claims she's using Tinder. 

The marketing manager, 26, was forced to respond to rumours she's using the dating app after Woman's Day claimed her profile surfaced last week.

'I haven't seen the article but I'm definitely not on Tinder and have actually never had a profile on there,' she told The Wash.

'It must be a fake account,' she explained. 

'I think I'll just be focusing on myself for a little while. I'm open to it if the right person comes along but I only just feel like this is the first week I've got my life back!'

On Monday, Woman's Day  claimed Bella had been spotted on dating app Tinder.  

A Tinder profile surfaced last week, with fans claiming they'd happily 'swipe right' to score a date with the marketing manager.

It's unclear if the profile was real, as fake and catfish accounts often are created with photos of celebrity and reality TV stars. 

Meanwhile, Bachelor host Osher Gunsberg also hinted the Sydney-based stunner could be headed for season four of Bachelor In Paradise.

Discussing the finale on Channel 10's podcast The Reality Bite: Cocktails and Roses, Osher said: 'Maybe it's not the last we'll see of Bella.'

'Part of me really wants to say 'bula Bella' under a bure': Osher said he hoped to welcome Bella (pictured) to Paradise next season, but admitted plans were up in the air amid COVID-19

'I don't know if we're going to go back at any point, but part of me really wants to say 'bula Bella' under a bure, but I don't know if we're going to do Paradise in Fiji at the moment. I don't know what's going to happen,' he said. 

Osher's podcast co-host and former Bachelor In Paradise star Alisha Aitken-Radburn suggested Queensland's Noosa might make for a suitability alternative amid current coronavirus travel restrictions.   

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Bella Varelis for comment.

Meanwhile, Locky has been flaunting his new relationship with Irena at every opportunity since breaking things off with Bella in the finale.

He even took a subtle jab at Bella during a hike with Irena in New South Wales on Sunday.

'She does hike! I'm seeing it with my own eyes!' he said, after Bella had accused Irena of lying about her love of hiking on the show.
