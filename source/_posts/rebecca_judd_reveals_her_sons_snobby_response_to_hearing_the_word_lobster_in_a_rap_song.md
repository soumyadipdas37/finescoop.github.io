She's the glamorous AFL WAG who enjoys the finer things in life. 

And it seems Rebecca Judd, 37, has already passed her expensive taste onto her three-year-old son Tom. 

On Monday's 3pm Pick Up, the mother-of-four left her co-host Katie 'Monty' Dimond in hysterics after revealing Tom's very snobby response to hearing Drake's new song Popstar.

'I played it to my twins Tom and Darcy this morning and this was their reaction,' Rebecca said, playing a segment of Drake's song where he raps the phrase: 'Busy at the crib, cookin' salmon with the lobster.' 

'Lobster! I like eating lobster,' Tom can be heard exclaiming in the background of the recording.  

'A three-year-old but I like eating lobster! Of course that is a Judd kid saying that. Out of everything, that's what he notices!' chuckled Monty.

Setting the record straight! Rebecca (pictured at a Japanese restaurant with twin sons Tom and Darcy) interjected: 'For the record, he has never tried lobster in his life' 

Rebecca, who lives in a $7.3million mansion in Melbourne's affluent suburb of Brighton, interjected: 'For the record, he has never tried lobster in his life.' 

'Sure!' Monty quipped.

Rebecca continued, insisting that somehow Tom just 'gravitated towards' the phrase about lobsters.  

At home restaurant! In April, Rebecca revealed on Instagram that she's been feeding her family with restaurant-quality food from Melbourne Crown's Atlantic Group during COVID-19 lockdown

While Tom may not have eaten the expensive crustacean before, he is no stranger to high-class dining.
