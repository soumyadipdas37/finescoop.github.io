Sharing a fun video to Zara Larsson's Lush Life, Susie filmed herself relaxing on a sun lounger as she focused on her book - Odd Girl Out by Elizabeth Jane Howard.

The actress then panned on to her growing baby bump as she showed herself using a hydrating mist.

Susie then smiled to the camera in another sweet shot while she also focused on an ice cold glass of refreshing water with lemon.

The star captioned the video with 'September summer' followed by sun emojis.

Just last month, Susie and her partner Raphael enjoyed a babymoon to Lake Como, Italy, where she shared a slew of loved-up holiday snaps.

Susie and her other half are already parents to their little girl Noa, who they welcomed in January last year.  

Following the birth, the media personality gave an insight into motherhood as she shared a candid snap on Instagram while breastfeeding her daughter.

The TV star looked radiant as she gazed lovingly at her child while they shared an intimate moment. 

Mother-of-one Susie went make-up free as she sat on a bed, wearing her brunette locks effortlessly tousled. 

The Casualty actress has kept her relationship with Raphael firmly under wraps, following her split from rugby star Rob Kearney back in 2012.

She rose to fame as glamour model Chardonnay on Footballers' Wives back in 2002, but her alter-ego tragically passed away in the second series of the ITV show. 

Bundle of joy! The TV actress and her other half are already parents to their little girl Noa, who they welcomed in January last year
