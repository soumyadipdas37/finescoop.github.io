This is the hilarious moment a bear was caught on security footage ringing a house doorbell with its paw. 

The footage was captured at around 10pm in Truckee, California, and shows two bears wandering around on the front yard of a property.

As one bear walks out of the shot, a second comes straight towards the front door and jumps up, resting its paws on the house.

As the animal does this, it accidentally rings the doorbell, and its ears prick up with surprise at the noise. 

It even raises a paw to the camera and sticks its nose to the lens for a close up shot before wandering off. 

The footage was captured on September 7.  

The owner of the home said that they thought it was a prank when they heard their doorbell ring at such a late hour.

Two bears wander outside the property and as one bear walks away, a second comes straight towards the front door 

They were still up working and heard the sound which 'alarmed them' as they live in a quiet neighborhood.  

They said: 'We decided to check the doorbell cam before going downstairs to answer the door. 

'We both laughed hysterically when we saw the bears. When we finally opened the door, they were gone. 

'Unfortunately, the video only captured one ring. But it's still pretty funny.' 

The population of black bear in California is estimated to be between 30,000 and 40,000.   

The owners of the home 'laughed hysterically' when they realised it was bears ringing their doorbell and not a prank
