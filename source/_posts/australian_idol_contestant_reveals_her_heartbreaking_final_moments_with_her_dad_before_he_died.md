A former Australian Idol star has revealed her heartbreaking final moments with her dad as he passed away in hospital. 

Kim Cooper took to Facebook on Monday to share the devastating news of her father John's death on Thursday from Pulmonary Edema, a condition where fluid becomes trapped in the lungs. 

Despite strict coronavirus restrictions in Victoria, the 32-year-old, who featured in the hit TV series in 2009, said medical staff allowed her to remain by her father's side until he slipped away. 

'It is with disbelief and deep sadness that my sister and I let you know that after falling ill on Wednesday and a long, hard night fighting in ICU, my beautiful Dad passed away,' she wrote.

'By some miracle, I was allowed into ICU and was holding his hand, playing the Beatles and telling him how loved he was right till the very end.'

The singer had been as a live-in carer for her father in Ocean Grove, 22km southeast of Geelong, after two-stroke like episodes in 205 left him unable to look after himself. 

In the post, the performer paid tribute to the 'incredible' man and urged others to hold their loved ones close. 

'My father was the most incredible man I have ever known, and it has been my greatest joy & privilege to have cared for him the last 5 years,' she continued.

'My family and I always been so aware of how many loved sharing our journey together and having a front row seat to his humour and wit. I took great joy in being able to share his wonderfulness with you all.'

'Please hug those closest to you tonight & tell them you love them.'

The 63-year-old's health had been deteriorating since 2000, after he had two brain tumours removed. 

After the incidents in 2015, Mr Cooper lost use of his body, all his strength, his memory, sense of surroundings, as well as battling Parkinson’s disease, diabetes and dementia.  

The vocalist, who came seventh on the hit series in 2009, had been caring for her father for the past five years after two-medical incidents left him unable to look after himself

Reflecting on her role as a carer, Ms Cooper told the Geelong Advertiser  last year that the duty changed her perspective on life.  

'I knew literally nothing. I came down while Dad was in hospital for a month and just watched and listened to the nurses,' she said.

'That responsibility was an adjustment, going from a very carefree adult to that type of a role reversal – this is a man who changed my nappies.' 

'Caring for Dad has helped develop me into a better, more well-rounded person.'

Ms Cooper placed seventh in the reality TV show's seventh season in 2009, signing a contract with a Townsville record label shortly after. 

She walked away from the deal six months later to become a Christian and attend bible college, putting a halt on singing for five years until the church asked her to lead the music team.  

Aside from being a carer, the vocalist has picked up gigs since moving back to Victoria and works as a social media influencer, boasting more than 10,000 fans on Instagram. 

The seventh season of Australian Idol, the last to air, was won by Australian-born New Zealander Stan Walker who remains an active musician. 

The singer signed a contract shortly after leaving the show but left it to attend bible college. Since 2015, she has spent her time focusing on her role as a carer and working as a social media influencer
