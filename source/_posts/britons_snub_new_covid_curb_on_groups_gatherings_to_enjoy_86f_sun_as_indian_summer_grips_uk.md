Britons have snubbed the new Covid curb on groups gatherings to enjoy the 86F sun as an Indian Summer grips the UK with unseasonal highs to last into next week.

People all over the country have seemingly flouted the new 'rule of six' restriction, which was introduced on Monday, as they flocked to beaches and parks to make the most of soaring temperatures.  

Met Office spokeswoman Bonnie Diamond said that the heatwave is being caused by warm air being drawn north from Spain and Portugal by an area of high pressure.

She said: 'The warm weather is being drawn north from the Iberian peninsula.'    

Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna added: 'There's been wall-to-wall sunshine.'

Yesterday was the hottest September day since 2016 when temperatures peaked at 85F, with the mercury expected to be higher today.

Should temperatures reach 88F today, it will be the hottest September 15 on record - the previous record was 30.6C, set in 2016. 

Temperatures should be highest in the southern parts of the UK, though most of the country will see spells of warm weather.

The seasonal average daytime temperature for England and Wales in September is 64F. 

Met Office chief meteorologist Frank Saunders said: 'On Monday and Tuesday temperatures in Northern Ireland and Scotland will be in the high teens to low 20s but with cloudier skies at times, and the odd shower. Meanwhile England and Wales will be sunnier, especially today with temperatures widely above 25C.

'It'll turn hot in southern and eastern areas with temperatures reaching around 30C in a few spots, possibly 31C on Tuesday.'

Forecaster John Griffiths added: 'Tuesday we're still looking at highs of 30 somewhere in the south east maybe even a spot of 31, but it will already be cooling off in some south western areas. Across Scotland it will actually be a warmer day for many on Tuesday.

'There's going to be the potential for a few showers around in some western areas and one of two of them could be heavy and the odd rumble of thunder but they're going to be very isolated where they do occur. '

The temperatures will still be some way off the highest September temperature ever recorded, which was 96F on September 2, 1906. 

The hot weather comes as rules on socialising are tightened across England in a bid to halt the growing numbers of coronavirus cases. 

From yesterday, it is illegal to meet in groups of more than six people with the threat of fines for anyone found flouting the law.

The new rules apply both inside and outside, meaning that large groups in parks are technically banned from meeting together in the heat.

The September heat follows on from an August heatwave which saw temperatures top out at 93F for six days running last month.
