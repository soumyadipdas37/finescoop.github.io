A tweet from a woman in Humble, Texas helped business pick up for her father's food truck recently after she revealed he had only earned $6 in one day.

Elias Aviles' Taquiera Al Torito in Atascocita suffered due to the pandemic, but this week customers were lining up once more after his 21-year-old daughter's plea on social media.

'Hey Twitter!! I wouldn't normally do this, but my dad's taco truck business is struggling, he only sold $6 today,' Giselle Aviles wrote Saturday. 'If you could retweet, I would appreciate you so much!!'

In the past there had been days where he made $20 or $60 dollars but Giselle told CNN she thought, 'Are you kidding me?' when she heard about the new low.

Elias arrived to find people waiting from 6am for it to open at 8am on Monday. People are pictured Tuesday

'At that moment, when he told me $6, I said 'nothing hurts,' Giselle told Khou 11.

The tweet garnered comments and 2,000 retweets by Sunday night with one person even offering to buyout the truck to feed a hospital.

He had to close an hour earlier than the usual 8pm because they ran out of stock, which was being frequently topped up throughout the day.

Giselle stopped by to help at one point and says there were about 100 customers during her shift.

'There were so many people, and [my dad] was kind of shocked because he didn't think there would be a turn around that quickly,' Giselle said.

He opened Taquiera Al Torito six years ago after his brick-and-mortar restaurant went down due to the 2008 financial crisis

'It feels amazing because I was just trying to just help him. Just being able to do something that's going to give him business right now, that's going to get him known.'

Giselle's post got 8,000 retweets by Tuesday.

She has made her personal Twitter account private and created Facebook and Instagram accounts filled with images of the food on offer.

Elias started the Mexican street taco truck six years ago after his brick-and-mortar restaurant suffered due to the 2008 financial crisis.

His nieces and nephews help him out.

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, more than 100,000 small businesses have shut down due to the pandemic.

His son told ABC 13: 'We're really grateful for the support we've been getting and the positive messages.'

'I thought it was amazing I actually saw it on my social media,' Karla de Leon told ABC News.
