A man accused of bashing a great-grandfather has been charged with murder following the pensioner's death. 

Emiliano Lombardi, 84, was attacked with pieces of broken mirror outside his home in East Cannington, south Perth, on August 16. 

The 84-year-old was rushed to Royal Perth Hospital the next morning and remained in intensive care until his death 15 days later.

Quade Karsum Jones, 28, was arrested after the attack and was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent. That has now been upgraded to murder.

Homicide detectives took over the investigation after Mr Lombardi's death and charged Jones with murder. 

The 28-year-old is set to face Perth Magistrates Court on Wednesday.  

Mr Lombardi had gone outside to investigate a disturbance at about 7pm when he was brutally slashed with the car mirror shards. 

He suffered a broken nose, eye injuries, and numerous deep cuts and spent a week in an induced coma.

WA Police arrested two men on August 20.

Both Jones, from Seville Grove, and a 24-year-old man from Armadale were taken into custody.  

Jones, a roofing tradie, was also accused of indecently assaulting a woman aged in her 40s, striking a woman in her 20s with a metal sign and robbing a man in his 20s.  

His charges include indecent assault, robbery, and assault occasioning bodily harm.

Police will allege the attack on the great-grandfather was committed as part of a crime rampage that lasted for an hour between 6.30pm and 7.30pm. 

The 24-year-old man who allegedly joined Jones on his alleged crime spree was charged with multiple counts of criminal damage, as well as firearms and drug offences 

The alleged rampage included the four assaults, graffiti and letterbox damage and a brick thrown through a window.   

WA Premier Mark McGowan earlier this month offered his sympathies to Mr Lombardi's loved ones, saying he was deeply saddened by his death.

'Nobody, especially our elderly and most vulnerable, should have to suffer like this, nor be afraid outside their own home,' he posted on social media.

'My own parents are approaching Mr Lombardi's age - I can only imagine how his family are feeling today.'

Mr Lombardi's children Dom Lombardi and Laura Hussein have also spoken out on their father's excruciating fight for life and the painful reminders of his suffering.

'That roller coaster ride is unbearable,' Mr Lombardi told 9News. 'Those 15 days were complete torture.'   

'As soon as it goes quiet, I just see that image so that's going to be etched on my mind, I think for the rest of my life,' Ms Hussain said.
