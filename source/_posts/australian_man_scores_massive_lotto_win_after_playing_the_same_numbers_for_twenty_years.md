A Queensland man's commitment to playing the same lotto numbers for 20 years has finally paid off after he won a huge jackpot.  

The man, from Chermside in Brisbane's north, could barely sleep on Monday after he discovered he had taken home the $1million Gold Lotto prize.    

He said thanks to the win he can finally fulfill a lifelong dream with his wife. 

'I have always wanted to go to the Easter Islands. It's been a dream of mine for some time, so hopefully when we're allowed to travel again I can make that happen,' he said.

He said he never expected the numbers to come up after playing them for two decades. 

'Wow. Just wow!' he said.

'It's incredible. Honestly, I never thought this would happen, you hope, and you pray, but you never think you will actually win the lottery!' 

He said he and his wife would invest the winnings into their retirement after setting aside money for their dream holiday. 

The man, who wished to remain anonymous, purchased his winning ticket from the NewsExtra on Gympie Road in Chermside. 

Manager Shannon Hickey said he wished their latest winner all the best.

'Congratulations to him,' he said.

'We hope he enjoys his prize immensely, just like all of our other winners.

'We have sold plenty of division one prizes across our stores, and it's always so exciting.
