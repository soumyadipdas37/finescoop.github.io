Marks and Spencer fans have gone wild for the retailer's new giant Percy Pig cuddly toys after an advert showed the cute characters huddled for a mock board meeting.

The British High Street favourite shared the ad on Twitter and Instagram earlier this week - leaving many shoppers swooning over the bright pink toy toys.

But the advert was met with horror by some social media users, with some joking it reminded them of a 'David Lynch short'.  

The clip centres around a boardroom full of the plush Percy Pig toys - which cost £15 for a medium and £25 for a large - as they sit in on a fake meeting.

A somewhat eerie xylophone chimes in the background as the camera pans across the rows of unblinking toys.

The toys are seen sat in chairs, with one pivoting round to the camera and placing one trotter on the table.

Others can be seen following suit in the next cut away, with packets of sweets on the table.

Suddenly, a person in a massive pig costume can be seen hosting the meeting beside a TV with statistics on it.

The pig enthusiastically waves its arms as the music continues to play with the toys looking on.

The video was shared with the caption: 'After a very important board meeting at Percy Pig HQ, the cuddliest (and piggyest) toy ever is ready for launch at your local M&S!'

Many commented they were desperate to get their hands on one, with one writing: 'This is fab I want one!'

Another admitted: 'I can see one of these coming home,' while one joked it looked like 'the best meeting you'll ever go to'.

American filmmaker David Lynch is best known for his TV series Twin Peaks as well as writing and directing films such as Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, and Mulholland Drive.

Known for his surrealist films, he has developed a unique cinematic style which has been dubbed 'Lynchian' and is characterised by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. 

The Percy Pig toy comes in two sizes but have reportedly already sold old.

The teddy is based on M&S's famous Percy Pig sweet which was originally released in 1992 and today sells more than 400 million each year.
