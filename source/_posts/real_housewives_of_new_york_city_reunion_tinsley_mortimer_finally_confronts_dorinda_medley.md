Tinsley Mortimer finally stood up for herself against Dorinda Medley on Thursday's second part of the RHONY Reunion on Bravo.

The 45-year-old socialite was accused by Dorinda, 55, of not being transparent in her relationship with fiance Scott Kluth, 41, as they continued their arguing from the first part of the season 12 reunion.

'Tinsley said consistently since last reunion, "I'm not seeing Scott," and then we all know the next night, she had dinner with him. We knew she went to Las Vegas. We know she went to Argentina,' Dorinda claimed.

'Why, do you have a tracker on her,' quipped Ramona Singer, 63.

Tinsley said if viewers watched the show they saw her true life.

Dorinda tried to explain her behavior toward Tinsley by saying, 'Tinsley, here's the thing'.

'Don't ''here's the thing'', ''here's the thing'',''here's the thing''. Let's deflect, deflect, deflect,' Tinsley said.

Show host Andy Cohen, 52, pointed out that Dorinda was 'so mean' to Tinsley during the past season.

'I'm sorry, Tinsley,' Dorinda said as Tinsley continued to rant at her.

'It's way too little, too late,' Tinsley said.

Show newcomer Leah McSweeney, 38, said she was caught in the middle as she befriended both Dorinda and Tinsley.

Tinsley insisted again that Dorinda turned on her after she found out that Scott gave money to her ex-boyfriend John Mahdessian.

A viewer wondered if Dorinda was jealous of Tinsley and her relationship with Scott.

'I wouldn't want to be in that kind of a relationship,' said Dorinda and described it as the kind where 'you have to give up your life and be totally dependent on a person'.

'Really? Oh, that's my relationship,' chimed in Tinsley. 'Oh, because now she's the authority on my relationship with Scott'.

Tinsley then went in for the kill.

'Your Achilles' heel is that you can never be wrong and it is going to be your end and your detriment,' Tinsley told her.

'Okay,' Dorinda replied meekly.

Andy also asked Dorinda why she flew into a rage on the season finale when Leah during a toast mentioned Tinsley's name.

Dorinda claimed that it wasn't authentic and that Tinsley didn't bring Leah into the group and instead gave the credit to former cast member Bethenny Frankel, 49.

Andy clarified that Bethenny gave them 30 names including Leah and she was also on the list of the show's casting producer.

The reunion also had a touching moment as Luann described her life after being arrested and coming to terms with her drinking.

She teared up while recalling her late father who struggled with alcoholism.

'And my father was my everything. I adored my father. He was the most beautiful man. He had more class in one pinkie than most people have in their whole bodies. He was just amazing, and I miss him every single day,' she said before gasping and getting emotional. 

The reunion also included a heated exchange between Ramona and Leah, who was outraged about her bipolar disorder being discussed by Ramona.

They  eventually made up as Leah admitted that she missed Ramona's maternal presence. 

The third and final part of the RHONY reunion will air next week on Bravo.
