Arnold Schwarzenegger was spotted having a casual day in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

The 73-year-old veteran Hollywood actor of The Terminator and True Lies fame looked youthful in a California surfer T-shirt and shorts with black sunglasses as he added sensible shoes.

Later, the former governor was spotted in his door-less green Hummer with a male friend.

A wave hello to his fans: Arnold Schwarzenegger was spotted having a casual day in Los Angeles on Tuesday

When in the large vehicle, he slipped on a black face mask as protection against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 

The face covering featured the line in white, 'We'll be back'. 

It's a riff on Schwarzenegger's timeless phrase, I'll be back, from the Terminator franchise. 

The actor sported a healthy grey beard as he waved to the shutterbugs. 

Casual Tuesday: The father-of-five also donned a grey t-shirt featuring a surfboard print, blue shorts and tan slip-on shoes

On Instagram on Monday, Arnie shared an impressive clip to his Instagram feed.

It showed him bent over in a blue Powerhouse Gym t-shirt as he lifted what looked to be an incredibly heavy weight with a rowing motion.

The septuagenarian looked to be in his personal study, which was outfitted with gym equipment.

Timeless phrase: The star was wearing a black face mask as protection against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, featuring the tagline in white, 'We'll be back'

He captioned the clip, 'Old, but not obsolete. T-bar rows are one of my favorite exercises. Here’s some Monday motivation!'

And his son Patrick hilariously called out Arnold's selection of soundtrack for the snippet, commenting, 'Nothing like crushing a gym session to Taylor Swift. Feel you pops' along with some strong arm emojis. 

At the end of last month, the Predator actor made headlines when it was reported that he has signed on for his first-ever lead role in a scripted TV series.

Schwarzenegger will play the main character in a dramatic global spy adventure series, being developed in conjunction with Skydance Television.
