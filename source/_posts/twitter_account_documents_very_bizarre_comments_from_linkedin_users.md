LinkedIn is a place where professionals from all around the world can connect, but that's not always how it's used.  

A hilarious online gallery, collated by BoredPanda, of the Twitter account Cr** on LinkedIn has revealed some of the bizarre posts employees from around the world have shared to their page on the platform. 

From a man who insists you 'don't need a degree if you have a Ferrari' and a woman who inexplicably shared a photograph of herself posing in a field, some users aren't exactly being professional on the website. 

Examples also include several nonsensical motivational quotes, one made from balloons,  and a man who says he was inspired by a bug.
