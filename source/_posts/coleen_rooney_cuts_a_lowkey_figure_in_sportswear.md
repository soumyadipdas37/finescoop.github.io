She is set to undertake a 'forensic analysis' of WAG rival Rebekah Vardy's phone and email records ahead of their £1m High Court showdown.

So Coleen Rooney is naturally keen to enjoy some downtime before the proverbial fireworks begin as she was seen heading out in Cheshire on Wednesday. 

The WAG, 34, was showcasing her toned arms as she emerged in gym gear while filling up her car and grabbing essentials at a petrol station.

Coleen proved her off-duty look is as stunning as on, as she flaunted her fresh complexion and sun-kissed skin during the outing. 

She toted a carrier bag having bought treats in the shop, while she was also donning tight leggings and sporty trainers.  

Coleen's very public feud began when she accused Rebekah, wife of footballer Jamie Vardy, of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies. 

It has since been claimed that Coleen wants to undertake 'forensic analysis' of Rebekah's electronics to look for evidence, according to a report from The Sun.

A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Coleen met with her lawyers and they’ve told her they need to continue putting together more evidence.

'She needs to prove that Becky was directly responsible for the leaks or, at the very least, that the information came from her social media account.  

'Coleen is adamant she is right, but in a legal setting the evidence she has may not be enough to cross the threshold.'

It was also claimed by the publication that Coleen and her legal team will reportedly need a court order to be able to do so.

MailOnline has contacted Coleen and Rebekah's representatives for comment.  

Coleen reportedly declared that she 'won't be bullied' by Becky when their libel case goes to court.

A source told The Sun that 'Coleen is totally confident. She says she won't be bullied and is ready for a scrap.'

Coleen has also said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics' saying Rebekah's attempt to hurry along legal proceedings are 'laughable'.

This follows further claims that Coleen said she is 'not worried at all' about Rebekah's apparent rush to bring their WAG war to court 'immediately'.  

According to reports, Coleen has told pals that her WAG rival is only speeding things up as she's 'concerned' what Coleen's lawyers will find.
