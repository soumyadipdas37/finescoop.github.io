Wolves have secured the signing of highly-rated young defender Ki-Jana Hoever from Liverpool for £10million.

The Dutch centre-back made two appearances in the FA Cup for the Reds' first-team but never played in the Premier League, instead impressing for their under-23 side. 

Hoever adds to a strong summer for Wolves, who have already broken their club record fee to capture Fabio Silva from Porto for £36m. The club have also signed Vitinha on-loan from the Portuguese club, Marcal and Matija Sarkic this summer.

The signing of Hoever will be followed by the exit of Wolves winger Diogo Jota, who has agreed to go the other way in a £41million move to Liverpool.  

Hoever may not have broken into Jurgen Klopp's first-team but the centre-back was along for the ride in a golden era at Anfield, witnessing their rapid rise to world champion status and earning multiple call-ups to match-day squads. 

The 18-year-old was poached from Ajax's academy in the under-17 ranks, joining the Reds in August 2018, just in time for their magical two years featuring Champions League and Premier League glory.

Hoever managed to break into the Reds first-team four times, scoring against MK Dons 

Hoever's four first-team matches included a 2-0 victory over MK Dons in the Carabao Cup, heading in from James Milner's cross for his only Reds goal and keeping a clean-sheet. 

He also started as the Reds' youngest ever starting XI beat Shrewsbury 1-0 in the FA Cup fourth-round replay, while Klopp and his first-choice stars jetted to Qatar for their Club World Cup triumph.  

Wolves made a strong start to the season last weekend, beating Sheffield United 2-0 with a solid performance, led by front-man Raul Jimenez.
