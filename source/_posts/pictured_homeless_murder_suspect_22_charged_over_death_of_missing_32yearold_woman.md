A 22 year old homeless man appeared in court yesterday charged with the murder of a missing 32 year old woman.

Christopher Mayer, an Iraqi Kurd, is accused of murdering Lorraine Cox who was last seen in Exeter city centre in the early hours of Tuesday, September 1.

Police said Lorraine was reported missing two days after she was last seen. 

They are yet to find her body and are currently searching woodland at Newton St Cyres near Exeter and have still cordoned off a road around Exeter city centre.
