Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has dismissed 'fake news' about his future.

Suarez has been heavily linked with a move to Juventus after reportedly being informed by new Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman that he isn't in his plans.

The 33-year-old posted a picture on his Instagram story accompanied by the message: 'While fake news comes out... I'm good’.

There have been suggestions that the Uruguay international's contract, which has less than a year to run, could be terminated by mutual consent to allow him to depart.

However, it appears that a move to see Suarez leave Barcelona isn't as close as has been reported.

New Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman reportedly told Suarez that he isn't part of his plans

Reports indicated that Suarez has agreed terms on a £9million-a-year salary with Juventus.

Barcelona are in process of attempting to rebuild their squad, and have been boosted by the news that Lionel Messi will remain at the club this season.

Since joining Barcelona in 2014 he has scored 198 goals in 283 appearances.
