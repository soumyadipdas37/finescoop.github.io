Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is tipped to be granted a special exemption from the Queensland government so he can commence filming of his latest movie Young Rock in October.

The world's highest paid actor, who contracted and overcame COVID-19 along with his wife and two daughters earlier this month, is expected to land in the Sunshine State over the next few weeks.

Production of the movie is set to begin in late October.

Deputy Queensland premier Steven Miles outlined exactly what will be required of Johnson when he flies down under.

 'We have a (exemption) process in place,' Miles told radio hosts Cliffo and Gabi from Queensland's Hit Breakfast show.

'He (Johnson) would need to go through that process and get a special pass from the Federal Government, as well as endorsement from our Government, from the Chief Health Officer (Dr Jeannette Young). 

'But wouldn't it be awesome to have The Rock here.'  

In August, casting directors cast the net for locals to be a part of the Young Rock movie as extras, notably gridiron players and wrestlers.

Fellow A-List actor Tom Hanks recently finished his mandatory 14-day quarantine in a hotel approved by Queensland Health ahead of the production of Elvis.

The Forrest Gump star was also subject to police checks, standard supervision, compliance and testing.
