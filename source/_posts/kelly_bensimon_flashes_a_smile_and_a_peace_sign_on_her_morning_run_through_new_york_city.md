She may be missing the usual hustle and bustle of New York Fashion Week, but she'll never forget her early morning jog.

And Kelly Bensimon flashed a smile and a peace sign as she pounded the pavement through Manhattan on Wednesday morning.

The 52-year-old former reality star slipped on a pair of leggings and a sweater for a quick jaunt around the block of her Big Apple neighborhood.Â

Kelly sported a pair of tight grey pants with electric yellow sneakers while jogging in the bike lane on a city street.

She kept her arms covered in a light grey sweater with rainbow splatter paint details and wore a host of necklaces and chunky gold bracelets.

The Real Housewives of New York alumni carried a pink iPhone in one hand and kept her face covering tucked underneath her chin.Â

Her auburn toned hair was parted down the middle and worn in loose waves and she appeared to be relatively makeup-free.Â Â 

Kelly took to Instagram yesterday to honor her beloved fashion week as it takes a new turn with digital and smaller scale shows due to the pandemic and social distancing cues.

'In the Spirit of the New York Fashion Week, letâ€™s celebrate all of the designers, models, bloggers, retail stores, hair and makeup, stylists, producers who make Fashion week great,' she captioned a snap.Â

She detailed her lengthy history in the industry which began at the age of 16 as a model and transitioned into a jewelry designer by 25.Â 

'I have so much to be grateful for. Happy New York Fashion Week,' she finished the post which featured a vibrant hot pink Etro dress.

Governor Andrew Cuomo allowed NYFW to return this season, but new COVID safety measures included hosting shows outdoors with audiences capped at 50 people per show, according to CNBC.Â 

Kelly became a household name after starring on three seasons of RHONY as a main character between 2009-11 before taking on a guest role for seasons six and seven.

 In the Spirit of the New York Fashion Week, letâ€™s celebrate all of the designers, models, bloggers, retail stores, hair and makeup, stylists, producers who make Fashion week great. I started modeling at 16,Â Â sold my first jewelry line to Barneys New York at 25, I edited Top Model magazine at 26, I wrote American Style for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art @metmuseum at 34, created and was the Editor of the magazine ELLE Accessories at 35, hosted NYFW for @imgmodels at 36, and created my first outerwear line EnVille with @pologeorgis at 50. I have so much to be grateful for. Happy New York Fashion Week. Send me a photo of when you thought you looked so cool! #nyfw #fashion #newyork #nwfw2020. Wearing @etro.
