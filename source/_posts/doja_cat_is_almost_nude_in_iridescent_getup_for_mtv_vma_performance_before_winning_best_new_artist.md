She received the award for Best New Artist on Sunday night with a somewhat meandering acceptance speech.

And before that, rising star Doja Cat performed her hit tracks Like That and Say So during the MTV Video Music Awards in a skintight glowing bodysuit that gave off the impression that she was nude.

The Rules songstress, 24, looked at once space-age and reptilian in her performance costume, which featured metallic scales and glowing genitalia.

She also wore a mane of phosphorescent green hair that flowed back over her shoulders.

The controversial singer delivered her raps and rhymes with an insistence reminiscent of Nicki Minaj, as she engaged in interesting dance moves that seemed robotic.  

Doja was aided in her stage show by backup dancers in iridescent metallic suits complete with CDC-recommended face coverings. 

Other dancers looked even wackier, in dark blue bodysuits adorned with impossibly long thorns protruding from the back. 

Best New Artist: Later, Doja accepted her Best New Artist accolade in a somewhat tamer getup, that nonetheless featured an endlessly long braid of hair

Low neckline: For her victorious moment, the Boss Bitch diva donned a tasseled bright crimson minidress

If you're going to attend the MTV Video Music Awards, you might as well make a statement, which is exactly what Doja Cat did this weekend. 

Well, it's a good job she did get dressed up in this sparkling Versace number as she won the PUSH Best New Artist winner, so she really got to show off.

Modelled by Irina Shayk on the spring/summer '20 catwalk the red chainmail dress is designed with a fringed hem, deep-v neckline and tropical-inspired embellishment. 

We only wish we could snap up the dress for our own events, but sadly it's unavailable. However, it's worth clicking (right) to discover the designer's latest collection. 

Or why not steal the show in a dress from our picks that'll set you back as little as £19.99. All you need to complete the look is a towering pair of heels and a little bling!

And later, Doja accepted her Best New Artist accolade in a somewhat tamer getup, that nonetheless featured an endlessly long braid of hair. 

For her victorious moment, the Boss Bitch diva donned a tasseled bright crimson minidress.

The garment boasted a deeply plunging neckline, but the focus remained Cat's braid, which skimmed her ankles. 

Great backup dancers: For her performance, she also wore a mane of phosphorescent green hair that flowed back over her shoulders

The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event. 

The first VMA ceremony was held in 1984 at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, where Madonna performed her hit Like a Virgin wearing her iconic wedding gown/bustier combination.

The Video Vanguard Award has been awarded to 34 acts, and was renamed the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 1991, after he previously won the 1988 trophy.
