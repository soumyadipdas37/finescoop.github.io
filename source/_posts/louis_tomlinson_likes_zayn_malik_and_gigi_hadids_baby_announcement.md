Friends again? Louis Tomlinson has shown his support for former One Direction bandmate and new dad Zayn Malik by liking his baby announcement post - despite previously saying he wasn't 'ready' to make up (pictured with the band)

One Direction fans were quick to react to the social media like, with many gushing that 'zouis' - a mix of the pair's names - was back on.

One wrote in all capitals: 'I'm screaming, Louis really used his own fingers and either double tapped or pressed on the heart to like Zayn's post' 

While another tweeted: ‘Louis liked the photo of Zayn and his daughter, this is not just a “LIKE” Louis is really happy for Zayn, Zouis is still alive and so beautiful.’ 

However despite the happy news and Louis' apparent offer of an olive branch, it doesn't appear as if any of the other 1D boys have wished Zayn congratulations by liking the post yet.

Zayn left One Direction in 2015 and since then his and Louis' relationship has been rocky, with them not being thought to have spoken much.

Earlier this year Louis revealed he didn't feel ready to make amends with Zayn and said he believes that Pillow Talk singer has been 'disrespectful'.

Louis admitted that he thinks Zayn has talked 's***' in interviews but said he can understand that when you're in a certain mood sometimes you just want to 'run your mouth', referring to his negative comments about the band.

During an interview with The Sun, Louis didn't want to rule out a reunion with Zayn in the future however he confessed he doesn't feel ready to 'yet'.







Exciting! Thousands of fans praised Louis' liking of the sweet post, gushing that it could mean he was ready to be friends again 

As the discussion moved to his former band mates, he revealed he is still in contact with Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Liam Payne 'sporadically' however he no longer talks to Zayn.

Louis was asked if he's tried to make up with his former band mate and he said: 'No, but I've not actively tried. We've all got a lot on our plates and there might be a day where I wake up and think: 'OK, I want to right that wrong', but not yet.'

Louis has also spoken candidly about believing his and Zayn's friendship 'never really got better' after the singer didn't support his tribute performance to his late mother Johannah Deakin in December 2016.

Speaking on The Dan Wootton Interview podcast in March, the singer admitted that it 'really bugged' him when Zayn 'didn't show' at his X Factor appearance.

He explained: 'Truthfully it never really got better to be honest, I had a couple of calls with him after I lost me mum and, you know, all the boys had agreed to come to that performance and he didn’t show and that really bugged me.' 

While he was clearly upset by the incident, he concluded by saying he hoped that Zayn was 'alright'.  

Zayn and Gigi announced the birth of their first child, a daughter, in a touching social media post on Wednesday, calling their precious gift 'healthy and beautiful.'

'Our baby girl is here, healthy & beautiful' 27-year-old Zayn wrote along with a black and white photo of his heavily tattooed hand holding on to his and the 25-year-old supermodel's pride and joy.

'To try put into words how i am feeling right now would be an impossible task. The love i feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine, & thankful for the life we will have together x'

Shortly after she confirmed the news herself. Gigi said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. 

'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.'

Gigi hinted that her child was on the way at the end of August when she shared a stunning photo of herself at 33-weeks.

Friends, family and fans of the couple flocked to Instagram comments to send their love after the sweet announcement of the baby's arrival was made.
