Liverpool have confirmed that Thiago Alcantara has tested positive for coronavirus and is isolating.

The 29-year-old was absent for Liverpool's 3-1 victory over Arsenal on Monday night and Jurgen Klopp was coy over the problem that kept him out, instead saying that he'll be back after the international break.

He made his Liverpool debut in the 2-0 win over Chelsea last Sunday but has not featured since.
