Coronavirus has claimed the lives of one million people worldwide since the outbreak emerged in China late last year.

The virus has been recorded in 210 countries and infected at least 32 million people across the globe, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.  

Europe is now battling a second surge of the virus as the continent enters its winter months.  

The United States, India and Brazil have recorded the most cases, with more than 15 million between them. Above, people wear protective masks in Mumbai

The figure comes a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that then global coronavirus death toll could hit two million before an effective vaccine is widely used. 

Six months after coronavirus was first detected at a Wuhan wet market in December 2016, the global death toll had claimed at least 500,000 lives. In half that time, the known death toll is now believed to have doubled.  

The true number of deaths and infections are likely to be significantly higher due to insufficient testing and reporting in many countries. 

The United States, India and Brazil have recorded the most cases, with more than 15 million between them. 

The U.S. 'has been the worst-hit country in the world', reflecting 'the lack of success that we have had in containing this outbreak,' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, told a Harvard Medical School audience earlier this month.

The country has recorded over 7 million cases and 208,000 deaths.   

On Saturday, the U.S. recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases in a single day since August, after several states saw record daily spikes.

There were 55,054 new COVID-19 cases reported by health authorities across the United States on Friday, a Johns Hopkins University tally shows. 

It's the highest figure since August 14, when 64,350 new cases were recorded following a peak in infections in the summer.

India is expected to become the pandemic's worst-hit country within weeks, surpassing the United States, where more than 7 million people have been infected. 

The country has registered 88,600 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours in a declining trend with recoveries exceeding daily infections.

The Health Ministry on Sunday also reported additional 1,124 deaths for a total of 94,503. The average of new cases has fallen by around 7,000 daily in the past week after reaching a record number of 97,894 on September 16.

In recent weeks, Europe has been hit by a surge of coronavirus cases, prompting warnings of new national lockdowns.  

The global pandemic has also had an unprecedented impact on the economy, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) describing the resulting global recession as 'a crisis like no other' earlier this year.
