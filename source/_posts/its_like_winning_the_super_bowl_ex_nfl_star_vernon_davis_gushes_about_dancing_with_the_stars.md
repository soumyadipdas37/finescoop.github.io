Former NFL superstar Vernon Davis has told DailyMailTV that winning Dancing with the Stars would be akin to winning the Super Bowl.

Davis, who won Super Bowl 50 with the Denver Broncos in 2016, danced for the first time on the hit show when it kicked off last Monday night.

He impressed with a sensual foxtrot with partner Peta Murgatroyd - described by judge Bruno Tonioli as 'sizzling' - and earned enough points to make it into the second week of the competition.

And in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV the football hunk gushed about the blonde beauty on his arm.

He said of New Zealand-born Australian Peta: 'She's the most unbelievable person I've ever met. She's very patient, she's a good teacher and just one of those types of people that you want to be around all the time.

'She's just a joy to be around. We have so much fun in rehearsal. We joke, we play, but most importantly, we take care of business.'

Davis, 36, and pro partner Peta Murgatroyd performed a foxtrot that earned positive reviews from the judges and 17 points last week

Davis became a Super Bowl champion in 2016 while on the Denver Broncos. He's pictured with his 'champion' cap after defeating the Carolina Panthers 

Show veteran Peta, 34, has won the show twice with her partners and will hope that her and Davis will have that winning formula as well.

'I think winning Dancing with the Stars would be up there, like winning the Super Bowl,' he said

Davis, 36, said he loved every second learning to dance the foxtrot during the grueling rehearsals at a studio in Hollywood, California.

He said: 'I really enjoyed the foxtrot once I was introduced to it, I was like, wow, this is a great dance. I like that you can be nice and open. Your frame, your posture, chin held high. And it's all about the details. You have to really be on the details if you want to have a great performance.'

Davis says it has been 'complex' working around the COVID-19 restrictions at the studio and says he and his fellow stars are tested daily.

'We don't really have the opportunity to go into the other rooms and meet with the other stars,' he explained.

'And it's just been tough. The closest we've gotten to the other stars and the dancers is just Zoom pretty much.'

Davis, who set pulses racing with his tight fitting outfit last Monday night, said he can't compete with handsome actor Jesse Metcalfe when it comes to being the show heartthrob, however.

'Whatever the ladies think, I'll just let them think it,' he said. 'Jesse's the man, I had an opportunity to chat with him, he seemed like an approachable, likable guy.'

Davis gushed about his dance partner Peta: 'She's the most unbelievable person I've ever met. She's very patient, she's a good teacher and just one of those types of people that you want to be around all the time'

Davis' moves impressed the judges as he danced a sensual foxtrot, scoring enough points to make it into the second week of competition

Davis does have his own fan club back home in Washington D.C. though.

His three children Valaughn, six, Valleigh, nine and Jianni, 12, who he had with his ex Janel Horne, will be glued to the TV for every performance. 

And Davis said they've been a big help with his preparations before he jetted to the west coast.

'We were actually practicing before I got on the plane and came out here to LA, they were happy, especially my daughter,' he said.

'She was helping me out with some of my moves, the foxtrot, we did a little rumba she was helping daddy go.'

And the former tight end admits all the dance training has been brutal on the body and a world away from his training in the NFL.

'I remember coming home three days ago and I laid in the bed, I'm like, wow, sore - right in between my groin and all the way down to my knee kneecap. I never really felt that before.

'And I think it's because of all the different lateral movements that you're doing when it comes to dancing.'

Davis says he and the other stars train for three to four hours a day and he's finding he's getting better with each day.

'Right now I'm nervous but excited all at the same time, I think it's a great journey to embark on, it's all about putting everything together, everything I'm learning and staying focused,' he said.

'I'm going to really make sure that I put everything that I can into each and every dance.'

Comparing the challenge to those he faced on the football field Davis said the two are comparable.

'I think winning Dancing with the Stars would be up there, like winning the Super Bowl,' he said. 'Because it's a great accomplishment that many people don't achieve. It's the championship. And we perform to win and to get to this place. 

Davis is also ready to 'embrace' the glitz and glamour of DWTS.

He says he's willing to become 'vulnerable' and open himself up to the flamboyant costumes often seen on the hit ABC show.

'I'm not afraid to wear the glitter and the diamonds and the flamboyant outfits, I'm just excited,' he said.

But while he's already causing female pulses to race Davis, who has never been married, says he's a single man right now.

'I'm just focusing, just taking it easy, just going one day at a time,' he said, while admitting he's still waiting for the 'right woman' to come along.

He added that the attention from the opposite sex has always been there during his football career, but he's always been about 'faith, family and football.'

Davis played for the San Francisco 49ers from 2006 to 2015. He was then traded to the Denver Broncos, where he won Super Bowl 50 after the 2015 season and signed with the Washington Redskins - now Washington Football Team - in 2016 and retired in February this year

Davis - nicknamed The Duke since he was a kid - had an incredible NFL career having played for the San Francisco 49ers from 2006 to 2015. He was then traded to the Denver Broncos, where he won Super Bowl 50 after the 2015 season.

He signed with the Washington Redskins - now Washington Football Team - in 2016 and retired in February this year.

He left the game with two Pro Bowl appearances, 63 receiving touchdowns and 7,562 receiving yards.

Since retiring Davis is looking to move into the world of entertainment and acting and hopes he can make a career in Hollywood. He has already appeared in a string of movies.

The star also knows he needs work on his grooming and style to make it in Tinsel Town and dressed smartly in a white shirt and a hand made tie by luxury accessories brand Title Of Work for DailyMailTV's photoshoot.

Dancing with the Stars with new host Tyra Banks airs every week on Monday night on ABC.
