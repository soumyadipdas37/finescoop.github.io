Leeds United have asked about Toulouse midfielder Manu Kone after missing out on Chelsea's Conor Gallagher, who joined West Brom. 

Kone, 19, is an athletic France U19 international who also has interest from AC Milan. 

Leeds' priority remains to add another winger while a move for Udinese's Rodrigo de Paul is on hold.



Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa has defended his decision to make goalkeeper Kiko Casilla Leeds' captain for Wednesday night's Carabao Cup defeat to Hull.

Casilla was banned for eight matches in February and fined £60,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing Charlton forward Jonathan Leko and Leeds fans have expressed their concerns over the decision on social media.

'I interpreted the feeling of his team-mates,' said Bielsa after Spaniard Casilla skippered the side in the absence of the injured Liam Cooper.

'His team-mates think he deserved to be the captain and we have to listen to those messages.'

Bielsa added: 'The players see in their captain someone they feel can represent them. I respect the opinions of any person. After that opinions can be argued.

'Surely those who judge Kiko ignore a lot of the things his team-mates see in him?'

Bielsa said that he could not ignore his players' request because a section of fans did not agree with it.
