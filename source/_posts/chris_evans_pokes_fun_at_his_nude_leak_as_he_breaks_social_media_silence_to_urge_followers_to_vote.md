Chris Evans was the butt of every meme over the weekend, following an accidental nude leak.

But the Captain America actor is taking the embarrassing situation with a sense of humor, as well as a sense of duty.

He poked fun at the scandalous moment Monday on Twitter, as he broke his social media silence to urge his fans to vote in the upcoming presidential election on November 3.

The 39-year-old wrote to his 14million followers: 'Now that I have your attention.... VOTE Nov 3rd!!!'

He previously posted a video Saturday, which ended with a quick glimpse of his camera roll, including a black-and-white photo of someone's penis.

It also featured a handsome photo of Chris, which was meme-ified to read: 'Guard that p***y.' 

Chris quickly deleted the video upon realizing his mistake, but not quick enough, as he soon began trending on Twitter.

The reaction on social media was mostly supportive, while it was also met with good-natured jokes and memes from friends and fans.

Brother Scott Evans, 36, posted: 'Was off social media for the day yesterday. So. What’d I miss?'

Avengers: Endgame costar Mark Ruffalo, 52, wrote: '@ChrisEvans Bro, while Trump is in office there is NOTHING you could possibly do to embarrass yourself. See... silver lining.'

Fellow Marvel actor Kat Dennings, 34, used the opportunity to call out a sexist double standard.

She wrote: 'The public respect for Chris Evans' privacy/feelings is wonderful. Wouldn’t it be nice if it extended to women when this kind of thing happens?'
