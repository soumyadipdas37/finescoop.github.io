Grant and Chezzi Denyer have one of the strongest marriages in Australian showbiz.

But it wasn't always smooth sailing for the lovebirds, who started their romance when they were both colleagues on Channel Seven's Sunrise in 2005.

Chezzi revealed on their podcast It's All True? that the pair began dating when they were both in relationships with other people.

'It was a rough journey' Grant, 43, and Chezzi Denyer, 40, have revealed their cheating scandal as they spoke candidly about their decade-long marriage on their podcast, It's All True? Pictured here: Melbourne Cup, 2019 

'It was a rough journey - it wasn't like what you see in the movies,' said Chezzi, 40, who was Grant's producer on Sunrise when he joined the program as a weatherman. 

When they first got together, Chezzi was married to another man, and Grant, 43, was already dating another woman.

'It was problematic, it took a long time to navigate,' Grant said.

Working together at Seven complicated matters further, as executives were apparently convinced Chezzi was 'leaking' stories about the pair to the press.

She feared the network would send her off to Cairns or Townsville as a punishment, but instead she decided to leave television altogether.

'In the end I left TV. I couldn't deal with it. My parents were petrified. I basically ran away and moved back to Bathurst,' she said.

The Denyers didn't confirm their relationship for a while, and even Grant's family didn't know how serious things were between them.

But everything changed when Grant broke his back in a monster truck accident in 2008. 

'At the time we hadn't confirmed our relationship,' Chezzi said. 'Grant's family didn't know about me but we had been living together for three months.'

Grant's mother apparently didn't want the couple living together, fearing Chezzi was a 'gold digger', but they persevered nonetheless.  

Chezzi remained by her husband's side every step of the way during his recovery, and they ended up marrying in 2010.

They share two daughters, Sailor, eight, and Scout, four, and Chezzi recently confirmed she was pregnant with their third child.

Grant said their unfiltered podcast was a way of the couple setting the record straight on tabloid stories concerning their marriage.  

'This could be a platform for us to level with you and tell you what the hell is true and what isn't true,' he explained.
