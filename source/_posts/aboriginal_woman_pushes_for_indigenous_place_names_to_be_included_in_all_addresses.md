Australians may soon be adding the Aboriginal place name of their district to their official addresses, thanks to a campaign led by indigenous woman Rachael McPhail.

The Gomeroi woman has already been adding it to addresses, and none of her packages have been lost over the course of her movement. 

'I would love for Australia Post and the Australian Government to make the traditional place names an official part of the address information,' she told the ABC.

'Secondly, I'd love to see Aussie businesses, universities, banks, MyGov, PayPal, Star Track, Uber etcetera asking people for the traditional place name as part of the address information when people are filling in the forms or going through the online checkout.' 

Australia Post is on board with the idea, with Ms McPhail in conversations with the postal service about the initiative.

'At Australia Post, we have a long and proud history of promoting and celebrating Indigenous culture and implementing measures that contribute to a lasting reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians,' a spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.

'When it comes to the addressing of letters and parcels, customers are welcome to include the Traditional Nation name in the address.' 

Many social media users have backed the idea and were eager to learn the original name for their areas so they can add it to their address.

Others have expressed concern that adding the extra detail risked the mail getting lost.

However, Australia Post has given out a tip on where people should include the traditional name on their postage.

'To ensure the item will be delivered correctly we recommend the traditional name is included below the recipient's name but above the street address,' a spokesman said. 

Ms McPhail found out about her heritage when she was 30.

Her great-great-grandmother felt forced to leave their traditional country because her children were lighter skinned and she feared she would lose them due to the common policy of removing children of partial European descent.

Now Ms McPhail does all she can to celebrate her culture, and wants it to become more prominent in Australian society.  

'She didn't tell anyone she was Aboriginal because she was protecting her family, so I celebrate my Aboriginal heritage for her because she wasn't able to,' she said.
