She has been busy renovating a bungalow with her boyfriend Myles Barnett.  

But Kady McDermott cut a glamorous figure as she took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a sizzling lingerie snap.  

The Love Island star, 24 , who has been working hard on her fitness throughout lockdown, flaunted her svelte physique in a white Calvin Klein set. 

Turning up the heat: Kady McDermott cut a glamorous figure as she took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a sizzling lingerie snap in Calvin Klein underwear 

Kady looked tanned and toned in the two-piece which featured a thong with the designer's branding on the elasticated banding. 

The soft bra meanwhile highlighted her washboard abs while teasing a glimpse of her cleavage.

The television personality wore her brunette tresses in a swept-over side parting and accentuated her golden tan with an understated make-up look.

Kady recently left fans confused after she announced she is still with boyfriend Myles and they will live in their new home 'as a couple', weeks after confirming yet another 'break-up'.

The brunette previously took to social media to confirm she will be living in her renovated bungalow with former TOWIE star Myles, 26, when it is finished.

The duo bought a Hertfordshire property together in April 2019 with plans to completely transform it into a two-storey house.

Orange you glad you came: The television personality also littered her Instagram over the summer with snaps from her sun-soaked break 

The brunette blamed their split on the pressure of the build which caused them to argue, as she joked that their renovation has been more stressful than having a baby.  

She wrote: 'Just to stop all the personal dms because we are literally get one every single minute, which is understandable.

'Me and Myles are will both be living in this house as a couple, couples do argue. It is a very exciting time for us both but also ridiculously stressful.

'Me and Myles can't wait to live in our forever home and will continue to share our journey with you.'

'Now I understand when people say renovating/moving home is more stressful than having a baby.' (sic)
