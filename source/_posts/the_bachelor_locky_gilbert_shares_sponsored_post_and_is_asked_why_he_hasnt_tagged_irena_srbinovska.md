Locky Gilbert cashed in on his Bachelor fame on Thursday when he shared a sponsored Instagram post. 

The 31-year-old thanked Quest Apartments for allowing him to stay in one of their luxury units upon his return to Perth with girlfriend, Irena Srbinovska.

However, a worried fan quickly assumed there was already trouble in paradise as they asked him why he hadn't tagged his other half, Irena.

Locky posed effortlessly for the snap on the balcony and gazed into the distance. 

'It’s been a hectic couple of weeks and I’m really looking forward to getting back to WA and enjoying this view at my home away from home @questapartments .Thanks guys,' he captioned the snap. 

While many appreciated the stunning view along with Locky, one follower commented: 'Somethings not right! Can’t tag Irena  I hope you 2 are okay? [sic]'

The former Survivor star was quick to dismiss the fan's concerns as he responded: 'We are better than ever @irena_srbinovska'.

Locky and Irena are currently on a road trip in NSW, before beginning a three-day drive back to Perth to move in together.

'We just want to be together,' Locky told The Wash, before Irena added their plans for the foreseeable future involved being 'on the road'.

'Obviously, we've got out future plans, but right now we just want some alone time,' Locky told the website.

The pair will most likely have to apply for an exemption to enter Western Australia due to the State's strict COVID-19 border restrictions.

They will then have to quarantine for two weeks at home before being able to travel freely within the State.

On Friday, Irena explained that they are planning to live together in the same city: 'The plan is that I'm moving over to Perth,' a smiling Irena revealed on The Project.
