Elon Musk momentarily forgot his son's name during an interview, telling the press that it 'sounds like a password'. 

Musk was visiting the Giga factory in Berlin, Germany, when a member of the press asked him how his child was.

During the press conference, one interviewer asks Musk, who looks very confused: 'how is X Æ A-12?'

The Tesla CEO asks the reporter to repeat themselves before laughing and saying 'oh you mean my kid? That sounds like a password.'    

He continues: 'He's great. I think next time I'm going to bring him.'   

Musk and musician partner Grimes welcomed their first child together on May 4 and decided to name the baby boy X Æ A-12 Musk.    

This is reportedly pronounced 'Ex Ash A Twelve' with 'Ex' being the child's first name.  

Later that month Grimes announced the baby's name was changed to 'X Æ A-Xii' as it was reported that the child's original name violates California naming laws.

Under these laws only the 26 letters of the English alphabet, including hyphens, could be used.

Musk had been at the manufacturing plant for Tesla that is currently under construction in Germany. 

 Elon Musk has visited Germany to discuss his new European Tesla factory that is currently under construction in Germany. 

He recently overtook Mark Zuckerberg to become the world's third richest man with his $115billion (£86.4billion) fortune. 

Tesla is building an electric car plant just outside Berlin, and is scheduled to meet German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier earlier this month to discuss the plans.
