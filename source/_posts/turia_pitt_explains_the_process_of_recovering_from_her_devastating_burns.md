Turia Pitt has detailed the the process of recovering from injuries she sustained in a fire in 2011.

Appearing on The Project on Tuesday, the 33-year-old revealed she struggled emotionally at times, but found the 'positives' in the experience. 

She first had to motivate herself to take baby steps on her road to recovery, such as, 'Walk two laps of the hallway. Try to finish my hospital meal. Really basic things,' she said.

Turia explained: 'I had to adjust the bar or adjust my expectations of what I could do in a day. 

'Of course, there were days where I didn't want to do the rehab, didn't want to do the journey before me. 

'What I did is I allowed myself to feel those emotions, and I think that's really important.'

She added: 'What I did is I allowed myself to feel those emotions, and I think that's really important... We don't have to put a positive lining on it straightaway, [but] there is a real power in just accepting it' 

The motivational speaker said she found power in facing the truth of what she was experiencing.  

'When we are going through a tough time, we don't have to try and spin it, we don't have to put a positive lining on it straightaway, [but] there is a real power in just accepting it,' she added. 

Turia was on the show promoting her latest book, Happy (and Other Ridiculous Aspirations).

Speaking to Body and Soul magazine this week, Turia revealed that she still has 'ups and downs' in the process of recovery: 'I try not to beat myself up. I think part of being happy is accepting that you're not going to be happy all the time,' she said

'I try not to beat myself up. Life is full of ups and downs. We have hard times, but the reverse is also true, and I think part of being happy is accepting that you're not going to be happy all the time,' she said.
