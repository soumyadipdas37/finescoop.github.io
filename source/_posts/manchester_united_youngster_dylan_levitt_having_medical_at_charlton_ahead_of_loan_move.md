Manchester United midfielder Dylan Levitt is undergoing a medical ahead of finalising a loan move to Charlton Athletic.

As Sportsmail revealed yesterday, the 19-year-old Wales international will spend the season in League One with United keen for him to gain more competitive game time.

Levitt was given his Wales debut by Ryan Giggs last week and he has been influential in pushing the youngster to challenge himself by going out on loan.

The teenager faced Finland in Wales' Nations League clash - his full international debut 

Charlton manager Lee Bowyer is keen to add some energy into his midfield and Levitt has that plus an eye for a pass. 

Giggs has been made aware of the teenager's potential for some time. 

Levitt's first senior call-up for Wales came in May 2019 for a training camp in Portugal, before he was named as one of four uncapped players in Giggs' 28-man party for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Croatia and Hungary.

Giggs said: 'The only problem is players can go out on loan, it can look a great move, and then they don’t play.

Wales manager Ryan Giggs emphasised the importance of Levitt playing during his loan move 

'Then they’re training somewhere else rather than training at United and learning off the players there.

'It’s always a balancing act, it’s always a difficult one, but Dylan has got a big choice to make and hopefully he chooses right.'

United are still looking to loan out James Garner also but Championship Huddersfield Town have cooled on a move after considering other targets.
