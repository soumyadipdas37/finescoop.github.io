Authorities in Baltimore have launched an investigation after a man was hit with a brick and fell unconscious when an unidentified assailant ran behind him.

The alarming incident was captured on cell phone footage and shared to social media on Monday. 

Councilman Eric T. Costello condemned the attack and noted the 'complete depravity to human life' exhibited. 

Cell phone footage shows a man walking across an quiet intersection when a second man, wearing a black T-shirt and turquoise shorts, jogs behind him.

Cell phone footage taken Sunday showed the moment a man (left) was knocked unconscious after an assailant (right) used a brick 

Without warning, the second man suddenly raises one brick in the air and strikes the victim over the head with it.

The victim is knocked out cold and hits the ground with a terrifying thump. The other man immediately walks away in the other direction. 

It appears the brick used in the attack was left at the scene. 

According to The Baltimore Sun,  a neighbor called authorities after hearing a loud argument near the 100 block of W. Hamburg Street on Sunday. 

Police and a backup unit dispatched to the Sharp-Leadenhall neighborhood over the assault report, but did not find the victim at the scene.

Authorities who dispatched to the scene they could neither find the victim nor the assailant in the area 

The Baltimore Police Department has launched an investigation into the incident and ask that anyone with information contact Captain Eric Leitch

Medics who canvassed the area could not locate the victim either.

Officers later found a 'pool of blood' on the sidewalk close to where the incident happened.

A witness, who did not disclose their name or address, said they did not know the men involved in the altercation.

Councilman Costello on Monday shared footage of the attack on Facebook.

'It should go without saying that the complete depravity to human life illustrated in this video is absolutely disgusting and should be investigate and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,' he wrote.

Authorities have urged anyone with information about the incident to contact Captain Eric Leitch at: Eric.Leitch@BaltimorePolice.org.

That includes details on the victim, suspect, those who recorded the video and any additional camera footage.
