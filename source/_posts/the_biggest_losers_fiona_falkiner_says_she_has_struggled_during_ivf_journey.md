Fiona Falkiner is undergoing IVF to have a baby with her fiancée Hayley Willis, and she has described the process as a 'struggle'. 

Appearing on Today Extra alongside Hayley, 30, on Saturday, the 37-year-old admitted she feels her body has betrayed her at times. 

The former Biggest Loser host said: 'I have found it quite challenging at times. It's one of those things you know you think to yourself that you're doing everything in your power to make it happen.

'You are eating the right foods. You are being good to your body, doing acupuncture and taking all the herbs, doing everything that everybody is telling you to do.' 

Fiona added: 'It's like your body is completely out of your control and it can be really challenging. I have struggled at times. It's like why isn't my body doing what it's supposed to do'.    

Fiona and Hayley have been documenting the journey for their fans on their  What The IVF podcast. 

The Biggest Loser host said: 'I have found it quite challenging at times. It's one of those things you know you think to yourself that you're doing everything in your power to make it happen'

Fiona added: 'It's like your body is completely out of your control. It can be really challenging. I have struggled at times. It's like why isn't my body doing what it's supposed to do'

On the podcast, the TV star revealed she had recently suffered what she thought was a devastating setback, when she thought she'd taken her hormonal medication at the wrong time. 

She said: 'I just cried all night long. I was filled with complete fear and dread and thought I had put everything in jeopardy after all we had been through. I have never beaten myself up so much'.   

Luckily, the former TV host quickly learned she'd taken the medicine at the right time.   

Fiona recently revealed her 'traumatic' and 'lonely' journey in an interview with The Daily Telegraph.

Upset: The 37-year-old recently suffered what she thought was a devastating setback, when she thought she'd taken her hormonal medication at the wrong time. 'I just cried all night long. I have never beaten myself up so much,' she said on her podcast 

She told the paper: 'It is you and your body against all odds. Women don't really talk about it until after the fact. It can be really quite traumatic.'  

In the same interview, Hayley revealed that she, too, hopes to carry a baby, shortly after Fiona gives birth. 

Hayley said: 'Fi is going first because she is older. I really want to carry a bub too but Fi will go first just because of the body clock on fertility, so her going first is best.'

Fiona and Hayley announced their engagement in April 2019, after 10 months of dating each other.
