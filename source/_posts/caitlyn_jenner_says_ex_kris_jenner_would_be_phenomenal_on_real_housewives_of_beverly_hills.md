The reality show was the brainchild of Kris and TV host and producer Ryan Seacrest, and followed the lives of Kris' family, which included Caitlyn - then Bruce - along with daughters Kendall and Kylie, and Kris' four children from her marriage to the late Robert Kardashian, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob.

At the beginning, it was Bruce who was the celebrity given his fame as a gold medalist in the decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. 

But in the intervening 13 years, he has been eclipsed by the phenomenal popularity of the Kardashian-Jenner siblings, who turned their family's fame into a multi-million dollar empire.
