'I also feel like I got the opportunity to learn a lot about my country in ways that I never have before,' Gomez continued.

When asked if she still has hope for America as a country, she emphatically stated, 'One thousand percent — that’s something I’ll never let go of.'

'My friend sent me a news story that said statistically, my generation and maybe younger has shown less interest in voting than ever. It didn’t make sense because if anything, why wouldn’t we be more motivated to do that?'
