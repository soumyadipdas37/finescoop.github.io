Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace got their 2020/21 campaign off to a winning start in a gritty encounter against Southampton.

It didn't take long for a very familiar feeling to settle around Selhurst Park, as Andros Townsend flighted a cross to the back post for talisman Wilfried Zaha to rattle home on the half-volley.

The second half brought little of note, save for referee Jon Moss consulting the pitch-side monitor to reverse his decision to award Kyle Walker-Peters a straight red card.

Zaha had the ball in the back of the net once again on 80 minutes, though was judged to be marginally offside with his shoulder.

Host commentator

Thanks for joining us for coverage of Crystal Palace's win against Southampton on the opening day... 

Switch over now for live coverage of champions Liverpool taking on Leeds! 

Palace get the win on the opening day! 

Wilfried Zaha's early volley is enough to separate the sides here - three points for Roy Hodgson's side!

Southampton, though dominant with the ball, didn't do enough with it ultimately... 

And Danny Ings almost makes Zaha pay!

Walker-Peters' first time volley across the box is met by the head of Ings, but his header is straight at Guaita, who parries it away!

Drama at the end... 

And Zaha should seal it!

He sprints past Stephens as if he isn't there, but can only find the side-netting from close range - when he really should have scored! 

With the game now stretched, Palace suddenly have more of the ball!

It doesn't look like it's going to be Southampton's day here... 

SIX MINUTES OF ADDED TIME... 

Can Southampton find an equaliser? 

Saints skipper Ward-Prowse goes for glory again outside the box, but it's well over the bar from 30 yards out!

Time running out for the visitors now... 

Last roll of the dice from Ralph Hasenhüttl - Shane Long comes on for Che Adams. 

The decision is indeed offside!

Zaha timed his run near-perfectly, but was leaning just offside! His finish, though, through on goal was clinical into the corner... yet Southampton are still in it in the closing stages! 

Zaha's goal disallowed for offside! It's very, very tight... the Palace man may be leaning just offside. 

VAR review once again... 

A debut for new signing Eberechi Eze! He comes on for Jeffrey Schlupp. 

Schlupp does well down the left to win a corner for Palace, and McArthur has a free header in the box - but can't get his effort on target!

Saints make their second change - Will Smallbone comes off for Moussa Djenepo out wide. 

Palace captain Luka Milivojević replaces James McCarthy in the centre of the park.

Ward-Prowse does indeed go for goal, but Guaita sees it comfortably over the bar... 

Southampton pushing and pushing here... Palace unable to keep hold of the ball here. 

They have a free-kick, just outside the box here. James Ward-Prowse territory from out wide... 

Good ball into the middle by Smallbone isn't dealt with, and it falls to Adams who goes down in the box - no penalty though! 

The Southampton forward looked more like he stumbled there... visitors still pushing for an equaliser though! 

Not a bad opening that for Palace!

Schlupp's surge down the left can't find Ayew or Zaha in the middle, who perhaps didn't make the run required... 

A rare attacking foray for the hosts! 

James McCarthy gets a booking after catching James Ward-Prowse out on the left... 

Southampton fully in control now, Palace relatively deep already too! 

What a save by Guaita!

Che Adams pounces on a header down and his powerful volley is very well saved by the Palace keeper, who claws it away... 

Well, well, well...

Referee Jon Moss is instructed to go and have a look at the incident on the pitchside monitor (something I expect we'll see more of this season) and decides to change his decision to a yellow card!

Right decision found in the end! Kyle Walker Peters catches Mitchell on the end of the toe, but there's no excessive force. He stays on the pitch... 

Kyle Walker-Peters is sent-off!

It's a bouncing ball, but the Southampton right back catches the Tyrick Mitchell...

VAR check ongoing. 

Southampton have come straight out the blocks here in the second-half!

Nathan Redmond has a shot at goal from the left but it's straight at Guaita, while Kyle Walker-Peters' cross from the right after a surging run can't quite find a Saints body in the middle. 

A change for Southampton at the break - centre back Jan Bednarek comes off for Jannik Vestergaard.

3 - Southampton have won their last three away Premier League visits to Crystal Palace without conceding a single goal; Saints have never won four consecutive away top-flight matches against an opponent. Opportunity. #CRYSOU pic.twitter.com/mMY97zPn2y

Palace have the lead at the break!

Wilfried Zaha's volley the difference between the two sides - his 50th league goal in English football!

Southampton started strongly but no doubt faded as Palace looked comfortable as the half wore on - plenty for the visitors to think about at the interval! 

TWO MINUTES OF ADDED TIME

One of the last chances of the half for Southampton from a corner, but Palace manage to clear their lines. 

Not too sure why, but just had confirmation that Crystal Palace's Jeffrey Schlupp has picked up a yellow card...

Southampton's Will Smallbone gets the wrong side of Tyrick Mitchell and tumbles over in the box - looks more a coming together really, no penalty! 

No VAR review either. 

Brilliant whipped free-kick in by Townsend but Cheikhou Kouyate can only get a toe on it - and the flag is up! 

Again, very high line by Southampton... 

Southampton's main man Danny Ings is working hard - the England international attempts a diving header at the near post but can't quite get the power on it, and it's comfortable for Guaita in goal. 

Palace come close from a corner!

The driven ball in is met well by Scott Dann, who forces McCarthy to get down low to his left and parry the ball away! 

Jordan Ayew, in front of the keeper, is then given offside. 

Palace have stemmed the flow here and appear quite comfortable, despite their lack of the ball... tad bitty in the last five minutes or so. 

50 - Wilfried Zaha's opener for Crystal Palace was his 50th goal in league football (excluding play-offs). Super. #CRYSOU pic.twitter.com/C1KQo3RSN9

Southampton are taking a chance in general play here - their defensive line is extremely high, and so far Palace have benefited from that space in behind! 

That being said, Saints continue to control the ball - no way through yet though. 

Against the run of play, Palace open the scoring!

Andros Townsend finds some space down the right, and his cross to the back post is perfect for Wilfried Zaha, whose volley is clincal - past Alex McCarthy before he has time to react at his near post!

Saints have dominated the ball, but have been caught on the counter there... Hodgson's men a goal up!  

Stephens, gingerly, looks all OK to continue.

Early concern for Southampton centre back Jack Stephens here, who is down clutching his knee after a tackle...

A small glimpse for Danny Ings on the edge of the box, but he can't quite latch onto the layoff and Guaita collects... 

Visitors have started the stronger here!

First opening for Southampton. James Ward-Prowse whips the ball in, and Jack Stephens gets his head on it but it's comfortably saved by Vicente Guaita. 

The visitors get us underway at Selhurst Park! 

Crystal Palace: Guaita, Ward, Kouyate, Dann, Mitchell, Townsend, McArthur, McCarthy, Schlupp, Zaha, Ayew

Southampton: McCarthy, Walker-Peters, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Smallbone, Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Redmond, Adams, Ings

Palace in their usual red-and-blue shirts, with Southampton in their away kit of white with a red stripe across the shirt - reminiscent of Peru at the 2018 World Cup I believe! 

Arsenal cruised to a 3-0 victory against newly-promoted Fulham at Craven Cottage.
