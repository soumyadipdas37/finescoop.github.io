Hetti Bywater has admitted she is 'glad' her EastEnders character was killed off - because she 'hated her'.

The actress, 26, played Lucy Beale from 2012 to 2015 until the character was bumped off by her brother Bobby Beale, but the star wasn't a big fan of her alter-ego.

Hetti revealed her hatred of Lucy when she hit back at an Instagram troll who had been commenting on her pictures and called her a 'trampy little w***e'.

Honest: Hetti Bywater, 26, has admitted she is 'glad' her EastEnders character was killed off - because she 'hated her'

She wrote: 'Seeing as you kindly comment on many of my stories I will now take the time to respond to each one.

'Firstly, this "posh white" girl is allowed to talk in whatever way she pleases. As much as I'm very found of the English language, I'm free to use words as I see fit. (sic)'

But she agreed with one comment, writing: 'I'm glad Bobby killed Lucy too, I hated her.'

Answering another point from the troll, she said: 'LGBTQIA+ history is an extremely important part of education. To believe otherwise is ridiculously problematic and homophobic.'

Response: Hetti revealed her hatred of Lucy when she hit back at an Instagram troll who had been commenting on her pictures 

Hetti then added: 'Trampy s**t? Fair comment. I do love gay men yes I also love straight men. (The ones who aren't homophobic or sexist.)'

The troll later apologised to Hetti for his 'slurs' against her.

He wrote: 'Apologies in any slurs I used towards you. In hindsight I was out of order. I don't agree on all the LGBTQ but hey. That's individual choice. Wishing you all the best and again sorry for being a d***. (sic)'

Hetti wrote: 'The response is in people. Not the best but at least he took accountability for the sexist language. However, equality shouldn't be up for debate.'
