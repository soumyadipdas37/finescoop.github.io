Guessing what paint color is being mixed seems like a fairly easy and straight-forward game for anyone who went to kindergarten. Red and blue make purple, blue and yellow make green, and so on.

But it turns out the chemistry of mixing pigments for wall paint is much more precise and can have some truly shocking results — and Christian's reactions to watching it all unfold on screen has TikTok and Twitter users rolling with laughter.

In his first video of the series, Christian does a TikTok duet with user @smittenkittensmittens. In a duet, one TikTok user's original video plays on the right, and a reaction video plays simultaneously on the left.

'This is my favorite game to play, you literally just guess what the final paint color's gonna be,' he says.

The video shows professional paint mixing equipment, with a bucket of wall paint base slowly being filled with pigments.

'This is my favorite game to play, you literally just guess what the final paint color's gonna be,' he says 

Ta-da! In one video, he sees 'a little yellow, a little white, a handful of blue, and a lot of red' poured into the paint base and guesses correctly that it will be a light purple

Red, blue, white, and yellow pigments pour into the bucket as Christian expresses shock that all the primary colors are being mixed together.

Narrating, he guesses that that the final product will be a 'really dark brown,' as @smittenkittensmittens's video shows the bucket being sealed up and placed in a mixing machine.

When the mixing is done, @smittenkittensmittensopens the paint to reveal a pretty robin's egg blue color inside — prompting an hysterical laugh from Christian, who doesn't believe it.

Christian has gone on to upload 11 more such videos, which have caught the attention of millions of TikTok users and millions more on Twitter.

In one video, he sees 'a little yellow, a little white, a handful of blue, and a lot of red' poured into the paint base and guesses, after much agonizing, that it will turn out a light mauve — and is giddy when he is proven correct.

Mixing: Yet another shows 'a hint of orange, mostly mustard, and black' poured into the base, making Christian figure the result will be a 'poo brown'

What!? When the paint tin is opened, though, the final color is — shockingly — an off-white

'I just can't stop. I can't stop!' he says in yet another video. 'This is just such an addictive game!'

In this one, he sees black, white, yellow, and mustard dye added to the mixture and guesses it's making pastel yellow.

Again, though, he's caught off-guard to see a bright neon green when the can is opened. 

'Every time it comes out, it just hasn't made any sense,' he says.
