Grieving families should be allowed to create 'bereavement bubbles' with others in the event of a future coronavirus lockdown, a charity has said. 

The Sue Ryder charity, which supports people with terminal illnesses, neurological conditions or who've lost a loved one, claims this would help those who are grieving to feel less alone. 

The charity surveyed 503 grieving adults and found that two-thirds (62 per cent) felt isolated since March, while 59 per cent felt as though their grief had been forgotten. 

Two-thirds said that being able to form a support bubble would be a 'vital source of support' as they grieved.

Current 'support bubble' rules allow one family household to join up with one single occupant household. For example, a family of four could join up with a grandparent who lives alone, and they would not need to social distance amongst one another.  

The charity is urging the Government to loosen the rules in situations where a family member has died so that relatives can support one another.

Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, is backing the call in a letter to the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.

She said: 'Grief is extremely complex – even without the added anxieties of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown.

'For many people who have been bereaved since lockdown began, this has been an incredibly isolating time.

'The ability to form a bereavement support bubble without the need for social distancing, as single adult households are currently able to do, could make a huge impact for someone who is grieving.'

The research also found some 62 per cent felt the nation has become 'desensitised to death' amid the coronavirus pandemic, in which thousands of people have died.

A tragic 55 per cent feel their loved ones' deaths became 'just a statistic'. It is not clear if this was in relation to Covid-19 deaths or deaths more broadly.

Sue Ryder has seen a spike in demand for its bereavement support services, including online video counselling and an online community forum.

Chief executive Heidi Travis said: 'Integral and deeply personal elements of the bereavement journey have been disrupted for so many over the last few months due to social distancing measures.

'So many people have been unable to say goodbye to those who have died, they have then had to grieve in isolation, without the physical presence or touch of those close to them.'

Matt Williams, head of information and support at terminal illness charity Marie Curie, added: 'People accessing our bereavement support service are telling us that the absence of normal support networks such as friends and family is proving incredibly tough.

'Many people have not been able to say proper goodbyes, attend funerals or hug friends and family. 

'Bereavement bubbles could help alleviate this and the potential long term effect complicated grief can cause.'

It comes after Boris Johnson was being branded 'heartless' for snubbing five requests to speak to families bereaved in the wake of Covid-19.

The Prime Minister had earlier said 'of course I will meet the bereaved' when questioned last week in an interview about attempts by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group to secure a meeting. 

But days later he wrote to the group to say he was 'unable' to meet them, which he later said was due to an ongoing legal challenge.

He claimed he would 'certainly' meet them once the litigation is concluded when asked by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in the Commons on Wednesday.

 Funerals

The Government's current guidelines state that up to 30 people can attend a funeral in England and Northern Ireland as long as there is enough space to maintain social distancing. 

In Scotland just 20 people can attend while in Wales there isn't a set number but people are advised to keep numbers 'as low as possible'.

You must wear a face mask or covering to attend an indoor funeral in Scotland. The person leading the funeral service or providing the eulogy can remove their covering. But they must stay two metres away from others or be separated by a protective screen. 

However, some venues will have their own rules - meaning that they may allow more or less people in. 

Care homes  

The Government has eased its restrictions of only letting one set person visit someone in a care home.

Care homes are now encouraged to enforce their own visitation policies based on available space and whether social distancing is possible. 

The wearing of face masks and PPE is encouraged.  

Households 

It is prohibited to socialise indoors in groups of more than two households (anyone in a support bubble counts as one household) – this includes when dining out or going to the pub.

You cannot socialise outdoors in a group of more than six people from different households; gatherings larger than six should only take place if everyone is from exclusively from two households or support bubbles 

It is against guidelines to hold or attend celebrations (such as parties) where it is difficult to maintain social distancing and avoid close social interaction – even if they are organised by businesses and venues that are taking steps to follow COVID-19 Secure guidelines

And you cannot stay overnight away from your home with members of more than one other household (your support bubble counts as one household).

What is a support bubble?  

A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. 

Single adults living alone, or single parents whose children are under 18, can form a support bubble with one other household.

The second household can be of any size and can now include people who are shielding.

The independent advisory group Sage has been asked to examine if, when and how people might safely be allowed to expand their bubbles.
