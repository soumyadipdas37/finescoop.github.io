If you're looking to cut back on your weekly trips to the coffee shop but are still after barista-style coffee, then you're in luck. 

Today you can whip up espressos, cappuccinos and lattes for less as the Nespresso Vertuo Plus is now better-than-half-price on Amazon with a huge saving of £112.

Now only £87.99, this top-rated pod coffee machine from Nespresso is a simple solution to luxurious coffee from home, cutting out the faff of beans, granules and grinding. 

The Nespresso Vertuo Plus is now better-than-half-price on Amazon with a huge saving of £112

The Nespresso Vertuo Plus gives you freshly brewed, full-bodied coffee in moments. 

Sleek, stylish and straightforward to use. All you need to do is insert a capsule, close the lever and hit the one-button brewing. Centrifusion Technology then spins the capsule, producing the perfect crema to complement your favourite coffee or espresso.

One of the best features of the Nespresso Vertuo Plus is that it's capable of producing different sized coffees, even in large cups. 

It actually has five cup sizes including espresso, double espresso, gran lungo, and extra-large alto - and it has a huge 1.8-litre water tank, which heats up in just 40 seconds. 

Another plus reported by shoppers is the removable water tank which makes it one of the sleekest and most compact models we've found. This would be ideal for those who are short on space but don't want to compromise on taste. 

The intelligent system uses barcode technology to recognise the capsule, adjusting the brewing parameters to make each blend exactly how the coffee is meant to be enjoyed

The foil-sealed capsules - which are almost twice the size of standard Nespresso pods - come in over 20 flavour-packed blends, including barista creations caramel cookie and vanilla custard. 

Even better, the pods are made from aluminium and are recyclable using Nespresso's system. Fill your provided recycling bag with used capsules and either take to your nearest Nespresso Boutique, drop off at one of over 6,000 CollectPlus collection points or arrange a free collection.

With 80 per cent of shoppers awarding the coffee machine a full five-star rating, it's a reliable choice. 

One delighted shopper raved: 'Fantastic! Produces fab barista-style coffee at home that tastes great! still easy to use as the original but with the added bonus of being able to brew three different cup sizes.'

Another agreed, writing: 'Simply the best coffee machine with a fantastic choice of coffee. I owned one of the original machine which was replaced with a very expensive bean to cup (cost hundreds) delivered a good cup of coffee, but no matter how many I tried could not find the flavour. Nespresso as the best flavour. Would highly recommend.'
