It may not be groundbreaking, but an eye mask which promises to block out 100 per cent of light can be a godsend for anyone who struggles to nod off at night. 

Whether you work night-shifts or need almost total darkness to get a get restful slumber, an eye mask is an affordable solution for those who struggle with a regular sleeping pattern.

The £6.80 Sysrion Sleep Eye Mask has caused some hype online with hundreds of reviewers saying it has completely transformed bedtime. While it may not be rocket science, it works. Shoppers have called the mask a 'genius design', 'super-soft' and 'improves sleep quality 1000%'.

The £6.80 Sysrion Sleep Eye Mask has over 1,300 reviews on Amazon and a near-perfect average score of 4.5 out of 5

Some of the biggest bugbears about eye masks are that they can be irritating and scratchy on sensitive eyes. The Sysrion Sleep Eye Mask is made out of cooling, super soft nylon fabric which promises to give you a more comfortable sleep. 

The skin-friendly fabric is highly breathable so you won't overheat during the night and it's been hailed as 'incredibly comfortable' by hundreds of shoppers. In fact, 71 per cent of Amazon customers gave the mask a full five-star rating, which is impressive. 

The cotton padding inside not only provides extra cushioning, but also acts as a buffer between the eyes and the sleep mask itself so you won't feel anything on your eyes or head when you are sleeping. No eye pressure and no sleep mark means it's a lifesaver when you want to keep your eye makeup in place while travelling or when taking a power nap.

Wider than most other eye masks, the extra material creates the ultimate black-out zone, helping you to drift off in record time. 

'Complete darkness at last. This is the best thing I have ever bought for myself. They went on to write 'This gives full coverage. There's a little flap near the bridge of the nose which you fold up, and it blocks out that light. I've never had a mask which blocks out all light before. This does. It's so soft and comfortable and stays put all night.'

Another agreed, writing: 'Improves sleep quality 1000%. I've worn this eye mask every night since receiving it. It stays on all night, the flap by the nose/eyes really does block the sunlight, and it's an extremely soft fabric.'

Another impressive feature is that it doesn't come with the usual elastic strap, which can be too big or cause discomfort. The soft adjustable velcro tape not only makes for extra comfort and better light blocking, but also covers your ears muffling out noise to help you nod off even quicker. 

'Helps me get to sleep, the bonus is that it covers your ears as well, so light and sound deprivation helps to relax you. Because the band is velcro and not elastic, you can adjust it to fit perfectly. I was very surprised just how comfortable it was compared to previous sleep masks.'

A second shopper raved about the Sysrion Sleep Eye Mask, writing: 'Wow I can't believe how much this has helped improve my sleep. If you have any trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, this mask will help you. I never go to bed without it on now.'

A third wrote: 'This is heaven, so soft, fits any size. I was having trouble sleeping over the past few weeks with the pandemic the first night I wore it I slept like a baby. The nose bit lets you breathe easily, and it doesn't come off in the middle of the night would definitely recommend.'
