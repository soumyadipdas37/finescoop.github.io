Scott Disick has been enjoying some quality time with his three kids, following his split with Sofia Richie.

And the Talentless creator appears to have his hands full with daughter Penelope's most recent playdate. 

He was ever the doting dad Tuesday, as he took to his Instagram Story with an adorable photo, while chaperoning a pool party for Penelope, niece North West and some friends.

He shares Penelope, eight, and sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, with ex Kourtney Kardashian, 41, with whom he was in an on-again, off-again relationship from 2005 to 2016.  

They recently sparked rumors of another baby on the way, as her sister Kim Kardashian, 39, put them on the spot during a family gathering. 

The SKIMS mogul said in a teaser for Keeping Up with the Kardashians: 'Scott's like, "We're going for baby number four."'

The pair has certainly been spending plenty of time together with their kids during quarantine, after he split with Sofia, 22, back in May.

An insider told People last month of the split: 'It's always been difficult for them to balance their relationship with Scott's family life. His kids will always come first.'

Rumor mill: 'Is that serious? I want to know,' Kim pressed, as 'momager' Kris Jenner asked the pair: 'Are you pregnant?'

But the Flip It Like Disick star is reportedly just platonic with Kourtney, as they remain strict co-parents for their three children.

A source told HollywoodLife earlier this month: 'So much time has passed since they have been in a romantic relationship and they are not interested in rekindling it. 

'They are just trying to be good parents and if that means they hang out more together, that is totally something they can figure out. They are very happy to be in each other’s lives forever even if it doesn’t return to a deeper love connection that they had in the past.'

Toxic environment: Kourtney left the show back in March, later citing a 'toxic environment' to Vogue Arabia as reason for her departure
