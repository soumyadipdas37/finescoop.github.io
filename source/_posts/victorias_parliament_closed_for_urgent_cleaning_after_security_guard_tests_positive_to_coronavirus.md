A security guard at Victoria's Parliament House has tested positive for coronavirus.

Victoria's Parliament House and grounds have been closed for cleaning and contact tracing has begun. 

Politicians are waiting on advice from Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to see if they need individual testing, although some have already taken this precaution.

The security guard tested positive on Thursday to the virus.

Legislative Assembly Speaker Colin Brooks and Legislative Council President Nazih Elasmar said in a joint statement on Sunday that the contracted security guard had stayed home on the day and started to feel unwell.

'Deep cleaning of the areas where the person worked in the building has been undertaken and is continuing. This is on top of the ongoing high-level cleaning already undertaken in Parliament House each weekday,' the statement said.

Parliament House and grounds will be closed until further notice.

Victoria recorded 41 new coronavirus cases on Sunday bringing the state's total to 19,835 with 723 deaths, the DHHS said in an emailed release.

There are 1,157 active cases of which 116 are in hospital and 11 in intensive care.

More to come.
