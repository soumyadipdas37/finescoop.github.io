Nintendo announced the character Steve from the popular video game Minecraft will be the newest fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the firm's Switch console.

The company shared a short presentation Thursday morning that teased Steve playing a new Minecraft-themed stage and battling Mario in the first few minutes.

The game suggests Steve will have similar abilities used in Minecraft like creating swords and blocks, bringing the two worlds together.

Nintendo also shared that users will have the ability to choose other characters from the Mojang Studios game including Alex, Zombie and Enderman – all which will have the same abilities as Steve.

The reveal sparked a tweet frenzy on Twitter seconds after the 10:30am ET announcement – 'Minecraft' has hundreds of thousands of tweets and is still trending on the social media platform.

Smash Bros. game director Masahiro Sakurai said during the announcement: 'What's difficult, however, is the programming work required to bring the character to life.'

'It's a massive challenge. Plus, we have to rework all our existing stages so that blocks can be placed in them.'

Another broadcast about the announcement will be held on Saturday, October 3 at 10:30am that is said to include more details and provide users with a release date of the new characters.

Steve is the second character to be added as part of the Fighter's Pass Vol. 2 - the first was Min Min from Arms, who was added in June.
