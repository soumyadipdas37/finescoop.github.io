An Iranian refugee who set himself on fire on Nauru asked to see a psychologist, but his written request was not processed until the day of the blaze.

Omid Masoumali died in April 2016 from burns injuries he inflicted in front of UN representatives visiting to undertake mental health surveys.

The 24-year-old poured petrol onto his clothes and set himself alight.

With burns to 57 per cent of his body, Mr Masoumali was taken to Nauru hospital then flown to Brisbane where he died of organ failure 31 hours later.

An inquest into his death has been told an undated note from Mr Masoumali saying 'I want to see a psycologist' (sic) did not raise enough flags for the refugee to be granted an earlier appointment.

Catherine Cleary who was working for International Health and Medical Services (IHMS) said that if the 24-year-old refugee had written 'I feel bad' or 'need help' on the note, staff would have made immediate contact to check his welfare.

'In my experience, people will convey their distress by whatever means they can on the form. It will be with spelling errors or with grammatical errors,' Ms Cleary told the coroner.

'There has been many a time when a person having difficulties with English will still be able to convey their distress.'

Ms Clearly said she remembered the victim and his partner coming to the clinic on the day he set himself alight.

'The referral came through with Mr Masoumali's partner and we remembered them as a couple - it stayed in my mind.'

Despite having emergency appointments available, the refugee was given a counselling session on May 2, but passed away from his injuries days earlier.

It was also revealed Mr Masoumali had a history of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts while he was held on Nauru as an asylum seeker before gaining refugee status.

Ms Cleary said she was unaware of his history of mental illness and had not checked his medical file.

She maintained it would have made no difference to the triage of his request and the time his counselling session was scheduled.

'Mr Masoumali clearly had sought help before and was able to articulate when he required help or assistance.

'I would not have changed my triage .... I do not accept any responsibility whatsoever for how Mr Masoumali was triaged.'

In earlier hearings in 2019, Ms Masoumali's partner, who cannot be named for legal reasons, testified that she sat down with visiting UN officials and told them of her miserable plight on Nauru.

But she became 'upset and frustrated' when she believed the organisation approved of their treatment by the Australian government.

After the conversation, Mr Masoumali became angry before he left their demountable housing.

When she went to find him, she saw he was on fire, she said.

The hearing resumed in Brisbane on Wednesday after COVID-19 delays, with supporters of the detainees protesting outside the court.

The inquest's terms of reference have expanded to include Mr Masoumali's mental health status.

The hearing continues.
