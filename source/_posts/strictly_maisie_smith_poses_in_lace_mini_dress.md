EastEnders star Maisie Smith took to Instagram on Tuesday to show off her latest fashion look in a couple of snaps.

Maisie is joining the line-up of celebrity contestants on this year's Strictly but it has emerged that the stars are yet to meet their dance partners or start training. 

Good Morning Britain host Ranvir Singh, 43, revealed the news on the programme on Wednesday, shocking Susanna Reid who apppeared on the show in 2013.  

The show begins on October 24 with a one-off launch show on 12.  

Not impressed: Earlier in the week it was claimed that the male professional dancers are in fierce competition to be partnered up with Maisie (pictured as Tiffany Butcher on EastEnders)

Brilliant: A source said of the actress, 'All the male pros really want to partner with her, not just because she’s young and fit, but she’s also proven herself to be a brilliant dancer'

She said: 'It's all happening a bit later. We can't - we've not met our partner yet. I am eating fewer Pringles if that counts towards training, but that's as far as it got.'

Earlier in the week it was claimed that the male professional dancers are in fierce competition to be partnered up with Maisie.    

Maisie, who stars as Tiffany Butcher on her hit BBC soap, won Strictly's Children In Need special alongside Kevin Clifton last year – making her a favourite to win.

Green light: Producers have revealed that family bubbles of four will be allowed to watch the show while it is filmed at Hertfordshire's Elstree Studios

Meanwhile, the star reportedly turned down a record deal – which promised to make her 'the next Kylie Minogue' – so that she could take part on Strictly this year. 

She is said to have been told by BBC bosses that the singing career would need to be put on hold if she wanted to remain on EastEnders and take part in Strictly. 

A source told The Sun: 'Maisie wants to crack the music industry and several labels think she is really marketable. One told her she could be the next Kylie, with her girl-next-door looks and down-to-earth personality. 

'But she was told she could not take a record deal and continue on EastEnders and Strictly due to the BBC’s commercial rules.

'Maisie decided to take Strictly over the deal because she can revisit music after the show. This will give her an even bigger platform than EastEnders to show off her talents. She hopes it will be a huge chance for her.'

'We haven't even met out partners': GMB's Ranvir Singh shocked Susanna Reid on GMB on Wednesday when she revealed the Strictly contestants haven't begun training yet 

She can't believe it: 2013 Strictly contestant Susanna said that normally at this point, contestants would be 'up to their eyes in sequins'
