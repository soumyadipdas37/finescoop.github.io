Home cooks are whipping up decadent vanilla slices using just three basic ingredients found in their kitchen.

One Australian woman challenged fellow bakers on social media to share their recipes on how they created vanilla slices using a $1.50 Aeroplane vanilla flavoured custard mix, $3 thickened cream and a $3 pack of Arnott's Lattice biscuits.

'I want to attempt to make a vanilla slice using these ingredients. Has someone done it before that could give me some tips please?' she wrote in a Facebook group.

INGREDIENTS

Aeroplane vanilla flavoured custard mix

Thickened cream 

Arnott's Lattice biscuits

METHOD

In a bowl, combine the custard mix and cream with an electric beater until smooth.

Place a layer of biscuits in a serving tray or plate. Spoon the custard mixture on top of the biscuits, then spread the filling evenly over the base.

Gently press another layer of biscuits on top of the filling.

Cover and refrigerate for one hour. To serve, cut into slices.

Makes eight slices

Many quickly responded to the thread with their own versions after they used the same products to whip up the simple dessert at home.

One home cook said the biscuits are a great alternative to puff pastry. 

'I use these products, and find the biscuits easier than pastry,' she wrote.

Another woman said the dessert was very easy to assemble as it requires no baking.

'I made them for my family and they wanted more. I made mine with Lattice biscuits - and wow, they are yummy, wonderful desserts and very easy - no cooking just put in the fridge,' she explained.

Another woman said she used two packets of custard mix, 600mL of cream, half a cup of milk and puff pastry to create the dessert

Many admitted they ended up 'eating the whole' dessert because it tasted 'delicious' while others said they liked to top the slices with icing sugar or passionfruit.

Another woman said she used two packets of custard mix, 600mL of cream, half a cup of milk and puff pastry to create the dessert.

'It turned out beautiful, and no deep dish needed,' she said.
