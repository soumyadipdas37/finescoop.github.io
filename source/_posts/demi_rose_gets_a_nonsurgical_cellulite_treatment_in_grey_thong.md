She's never been why when it comes to showing off her eye-popping curves.

And Demi Rose proudly displayed her peachy posterior as she shared a throwback video of her enduring a non-surgical treatment to boost her behind.

The model, 25, opted for a skimpy grey thong and black bra as she relaxed while technician Shane Cooper applied the cellulite-boosting treatment to her legs.

In a video she shared on Instagram Stories, Demi shared a glimpse of the treatment as she relaxed on the bed.

The technician proceeded to run the cellulite-boosting tool up and down her legs and across her famously perky behind.

The video appeared to be a throwback to her time in the UK, as Demi moaned that she was 'missing' surgeon Shane, adding that he was the 'best for non surgical cellulite removal.'

Demi's latest slew of snaps comes shortly after she admitted her world 'could have spiralled out of control' following the deaths of her parents, as she opens up about her grief in a brave interview about her experiences with grief.

She suffered the loss of her father Barrie Mawby at the end of 2018, with tragedy striking again soon after when her mother Christine passed away in June 2019.

And amid her heartache, the star also discussed her mental health, telling how it almost 'got the better' of her during lockdown, in a candid chat to mark World Suicide Prevention Day next week.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Demi shared how she's coping with her personal tragedy and reveals how her heartbreaking loss has in a way made her 'stronger'.

The star revealed how she was forced to 'grow up' from a young age after her mother was left disabled following a heart attack, resulting in a then 17-year-old becoming her carer.

She recalled that after losing her loved ones in quick succession left her 'angry, sad, bitter and lonely', but added that she was 'lucky' that she had a 'good support system' around her and didn't 'bottle up' her grief.

Admitting that she could have easily succumbed to her anger and grief, Demi said: 'When my parents died my world could have spiralled out of control but you have to hang on.'

She went on to say that she was helped greatly by doing a lot of self-care and reading books about 'spirituality' and 'enlightenment', while she tried to look at her tragedy as part of 'life's plan'.

Demi added that though she's been through trauma, she's come out 'stronger' and tries to reflect her strength through her positive and 'confident' social media posts.
