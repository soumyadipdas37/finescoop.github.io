Australia's Gelato Messina has launched a delicious Dr Evil's Magic Mushroom ice cream cake. 

The delicious creation, created with eBay Australia, boasts a glistening red chocolate mushroom dome adorned with white chocolate buttons, a vanilla gelato filling and pieces of chocolate coated honeycomb and raspberry jam inside.

The mushroom is perched on a stem made of Messina's home-made dulce de leche and gelato on a popping candy feuilletine grass base.

The cake is priced at $21 and was specifically made to celebrate eBay's 21st birthday milestone with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue.

Available in metro Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, the re-invented Mushroom gelato cake is selling exclusively on ebay.com.au on Tuesday, 15th September.

Each of the midi gelato cakes has been handmade by Messina's in-house team of chefs at Messina HQ in Sydney and serves up to ten people.

The handcrafted gelato cake took over 100 hours of development in order to master an eye catching, jaw dropping, great tasting creation that was inherently combines both eBay and Messina in one product.

Declan Lee at Messina said: 'We wanted to do something unique to celebrate eBay's 21st birthday and thought a special edition of our best-selling cake would be the perfect way to do it.

'To date we've sold over 25,000 gelato mushrooms but this is the first time we've re-invented it with new flavours.'

eBay Australia's Sophie Onikul said: 'For our 21st birthday we wanted to demonstrate how far eBay Australia has come. From an online auction house, to Australia's number one shopping site with 40,000 Australian retailers including Coles, The Good Guys and Cotton On - and now the nation's favourite gelato, Messina!

'Just like eBay, Messina is a true Aussie favourite and we wouldn't want to party with anyone else! We are excited to share our collaboration - eBay's 21st Birthday Mushroom gelato cake - as a small boost in an extremely challenging year.'

All proceeds will go to Beyond Blue as the charity has experienced unprecedented demand in 2020
