Dancing With The Stars makes its triumphant return for season 29 on September 14.

So the celebrity contestants and their professional dance partners are in full swing on the dance floor getting ready for the much-anticipated premiere.

And on Saturday, with just nine days left to practice and prepare for their opening routines, Desperate Housewives alum Jesse Metcalfe and Cheer star Monica Aldama were among the celebs seen making their way to and from the LA rehearsal studio.

Aldama was spotted leaving the studio with longtime pro dancer Val Chmerkovskiy by her side carrying her bags. There's no doubt many fans will see the sighting as a sign they will be partnered up for the season.

The heralded college cheerleading coach, 50, already looked lean and fit in black leggings with a pink tank top, white sneakers and a black mask amid the still raging COVID-19 pandemic.

Following her rigorous workout, the Texas native wore her voluminous blonde tresses long and flowing past the middle of her back with a center part. 

Chmerkovskiy, who's a two-time champion of DWTS, showed off his rock-solid physique in fitted blue jeans, a blue shirt that had several buttons left undone and a white protective mask.

Metcalfe, 41, was seen for the first time pulling up to the DWTS studio in his vintage muscle car just before professional Sharna Burgess, who won season 27 with celebrity partner Bobby Bones.

Not long after, the Dallas star could be seen mulling about outside the entrance of the studio in a sporty ensemble consisting of grey sweatpants, a light blue t-shirt, white sneakers and a white mask.

While the Australian-born Burgess showed off her ripped abs in a navy blue sports bra and matching sweatpants, black sneakers and her blonde locks pulled into a ponytail.

She too kept a safety first motto by donning a brown mask for her walk through the parking lot and into the building.

Many other contestants and pro dancers were seen through the day making their way to rehearsals on what turned out to be another hot and sunny day in Southern California.  

South African dancer Keo Motsepe, 30, looked fit and ready in black sweatpants, a grey t-shirt and high-top sneakers and a black mask. 

Fueling another potential partnership, actress Anne Heche, 51, arrived a short time later in stylish white sweatpants with a black top under a button-down shirt.

She wasted little time in putting on her white mask that had a mustache on it, although she pulled it down momentarily to say hello to waiting fans on the street.
