Casting is officially underway for next year's season of The Voice Australia on Channel Seven.

Producers for the show sent out a call on My Casting Net on Monday where they encouraged budding singers to apply for the show.

'Do you think you could walk onto Australia's biggest stage and turn a chair?' the casting notice read before advertising a large 'apply now' sign.

The message continued: 'Click on the Apply Now link and take your first step… NOW IS YOUR TIME!!!!'

This comes a week after Channel Seven confirmed they had acquired rights for the signing series' upcoming tenth season.

It was reported last month that Nine had 'failed to renew its contract' for the 2021 season of The Voice, and Seven jumped on the licence 'very quickly'.

Channel Seven's CEO, James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.

Warburton already has big changes in mind for the show, including cutting the number of episodes and having a tighter production schedule.

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter time frame,' he said.

International coaches Kelly Rowland and Boy George will likely leave the show, and it's unclear what will happen to Aussie judges Delta Goodrem and Guy Sebastian.

Rumours have also swirled that The Veronicas will be on the judging panel for next year's season of The Voice on Channel Seven.

Presenters Renee Bargh and Darren McMullen won't be returning next year.

They have been replaced by Sonia Kruger, who previously hosted The Voice on Nine from 2015 to 2019.
