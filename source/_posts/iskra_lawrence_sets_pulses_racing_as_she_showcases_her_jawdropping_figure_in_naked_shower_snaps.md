Iskra became a first-time mother back in April, when she and Philip welcomed the birth of their baby son.

The model recently admitted that her exercise regime hasn't been 'consistent' since giving birth but said she was 'in awe' that her body has given her the gift of motherhood.

It comes after Iskra detailed the 'pressures' of breastfeeding her baby son in another candid video.

Iskra admitted there have been times when she's had a 'screaming, hungry baby' while being a 'sobbing mess' as she opened up on her anxieties about the process via Instagram.

The body confidence advocate displayed the various different positions she uses to feed her son alongside a lengthy caption.

'Let's just get to the point. Breastfeeding is hard af!' she wrote. 'And it's not ok that so much pressure is put on women to be able to do it. Or that you won't have the same connection if you can't breastfeed - that is BS.

'It's not 'breast is best' it's 'fed is best'. As I shared before my milk supply dropped completely and it was awful. A screaming hungry baby and I was a sobbing mess.

'I wish I wouldn't have put so much pressure on myself surrounding breast feeding. I wish I had a formula ready that my baby liked, and not been afraid of using it.

'When I tried supplementing with formula it really was the biggest relief and will happily do it whenever we need to.

'So this video is me sharing the positions that have worked for us - best latching and most comfortable.'
