Coronation Street's Charlie Lawson has suggested he broke coronavirus quarantine rules when he returned from holiday in Spain.

Speaking to The Mirror on Thursday, the actor, 61, claimed he has 'been sensible' after returning from his holidays, but had 'things to do' so he wouldn't stay indoors for the required two weeks.

Explaining his reasoning, Charlie said: 'When we've come back I've been sensible. I have things to do and dogs to walk and so there is no way I can sit in my bathroom for two weeks, it's not going to happen.'

Decision: Coronation Street's Charlie Lawson claimed on Thursday that he broke quarantine rules after holiday in Spain as he had 'things to do' but insists he's 'been sensible'

'You will find me an honest man, during March when it first started it was absolutely terrible and I am deeply sorry for anyone who has lost anyone.

'I worry for people who are very vulnerable... the old and sick. But I am afraid the rest of us have to get on with life. So that's what I have been doing.'

According to the publication Charlie was in Mallorca on July 30, after Spain was put on the quarantine list meaning those who travel there are required to remain indoors for 14 days upon their return.  

MailOnline has contacted Charlie's representatives for comment. 

Claim: Charlie (pictured in Coronation Street in 1991) said of his returning from Spain: 'I have things to do and dogs to walk and so there is no way I can sit in my bathroom for two weeks'

Charlie made his debut on Corrie in 1989 as Liz McDonald's husband Jim, and has been embroiled in numerous dark storylines.

His most recent appearance on Corrie came in 2018, when he returned to Weatherfield with a plot to con Liz out of her savings, with the help of his lover Hannah who pretended to be their dead daughter Katie.

After their plot was uncovered, Jim left the Street with Hannah after realising he had nothing else left, with the door once again left open for his return. 

In October last year he told Christine Lampard on Lorraine that there have been 'ideas' put forward by current showrunner Ian MacLeod, and he always sees Jim heading back to Weatherfield at some point to reunite with his true love Liz.

Explaining that he recently met and is still in touch with producer Ian, he said: 'For the first time in 40 years I've met a producer who finally keeps in contact with actors.

'There are ideas but he said if we come up with something.'

Of Jim and Liz, he added: 'They can't possibly separate those two it's like Burton and Taylor so who knows. It's very easy for me I've lived in Beverly's pocket for a long time so we're very lucky.'

 Not staying in: Charlie added, 'I worry for people who are very vulnerable... the old and sick. But I am afraid the rest of us have to get on with life. So that's what I have been doing'
