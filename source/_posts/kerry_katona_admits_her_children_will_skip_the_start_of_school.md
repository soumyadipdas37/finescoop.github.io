Criticised: Kerry Katona has received backlash from fans online after allowing her children to skip the start of the school term due to their Spanish holiday to celebrate her 40th birthday

Kerry had been staying at a luxury £1000 a night villa in Granada before returning to the UK last Sunday. 

Due to the lockdown restrictions for Spain, the family have been completing their 14 day quarantine at home, meaning her youngest children would miss some of their school term. 

An Instagram follower quizzed Kerry on her decision and said: 'Are your kids not going back to school next week when you have to isolate? Not much forward thinking.'

She responded: 'No they won't be.'

Congrats! Kerry's holiday proposal took place after Ryan asked her children, Dylan-Jorge, six, Maxwell, 12, Heidi, 13, Lily Sue, 17, and Molly Marie, 19, for their approval

It appears the TV personality has already broken quarantine rules as she she was pictured driving back to Gatwick Airport on Monday to pick up her daughter, Molly's missing suitcase. 

However, that can't dampen the Atomic Kitten star's spirits after her boyfriend of two years Ryan Mahoney, 31, popped the question during their family getaway. 

Kerry uploaded the proposal to Youtube on Wednesday, which took place after Ryan asked her children, Dylan-Jorge, six, Maxwell, 12, Heidi, 13, Lily Sue, 17, and Molly Marie, 19, for their approval. 

Sporting an elegant red dress, the blonde beauty could not contain her delight as she was presented with the eye-popping diamond. 

Now she is forced to spend time at home in the UK, Kerry can make a start on her wedding plans with Ryan, which is set to be her fourth marriage. 

She was previously married to Brian McFadden, 40, Mark Croft, 49, and late ex-husband George Kay.

In an interview with New Magazine, the couple hinted they could well tie the knot in a Las Vegas wedding
