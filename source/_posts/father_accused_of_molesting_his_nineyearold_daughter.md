A father has faced court accused of sexually assaulting his own nine-year-old daughter more than two years ago.

The father, whose identity cannot be revealed, is accused of inappropriately touching the girl on September 20, 2018.

He pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to one count of indecent dealing with a child under 10 years in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory.

The court heard the accused man was laying on a mattress with his wife and daughter in a remote community about 200km from Alice Springs, when the alleged incident occurred. 

Two other people were also said to be in the same room at the time of the assault. 

The young victim was said to be fully clothed when her father allegedly reached over past his sleeping wife to where their daughter lay.

He is then alleged to have inappropriately touched her.

The court heard DNA examinations of the girl and her clothing, which were conducted soon after the alleged incident, did not find sufficient evidence of other DNA components. 

The trial continues over the next few days.
