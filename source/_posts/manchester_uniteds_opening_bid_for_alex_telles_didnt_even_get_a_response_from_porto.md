Manchester United and Porto still remain so far apart in their valuation of left back Alex Telles that the Portuguese club didn't even respond to their opening bid, it has been reported.

Telles is on United's list of targets as they look to strengthen before the transfer window shuts on Monday, but it appears they are not close to agreeing a deal.

According to O Jogo, United submitted a bid of around £12m for the defender but didn't even hear back, such was the difference in opinion at the two clubs.

In fact, it has been reported that United's first bid for Telles (R) didn't even warrant a response

It is understood that Porto want around £18m for the 27-year-old Brazilian, but United feel that is unfair given he is now in the final year of his contract.

With just a few days remaining of the window, it is now a case of who blinks first as United look to tie up multiple deals with clubs around Europe.

Legendary right back Gary Neville hit out at the club on Wednesday morning, insisting that they need a centre back, a left back and a striker before the deadline on Monday night.

It appears a deal for Jadon Sancho is dead in the water, and United may now turn to a loan swoop for Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele as an alternative.

On the subject of Telles, it has been reported that United have already agreed personal terms with the player's agent Pini Zahavi, but they will need to up their offer to Porto if they want to get a deal done.  

United have also been offered Real Madrid flop Luka Jovic on a season-long loan deal as Zinedine Zidane looks to shift the £55m striker who has scored just twice in 28 appearances.
