An ex-bikie and founder of a secretive fight club has succumbed to gunshot wounds days after a double shooting.  

Albert Rick Difloriano, 55, was being treated at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital after he was shot in the head at a Lewisham home, in Sydney's inner west, on Friday afternoon.

He had been in a critical condition and finally died from his injuries on Sunday night.

Alexander Stefanovich, 36, was also shot on the same day and died on the way to hospital. 

The pair have become the latest victims in a spate of shootings that have put Sydney on edge over the last five weeks.

In that time, thirty shootings have been recorded which includes gang-linked violence and drive-by shootings, indicating criminal groups were having little difficulty bypassing Australia's strict gun laws. 

Ten of the shootings were in regional NSW and 19 in Sydney's central metro region, which covers the CBD, eastern suburbs, Inner West and Sutherland Shire. 

Police were told Mr Difloriano and Mr Stefanovic had an argument before Mr Stefanovic was shot on Henry Street, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Mr Difloriano reportedly then went to the Victoria Street property, where he shot himself in the head with a shotgun, according to the police source. 

The Victoria Street property was understood to be the clubhouse of the Saint Michael Christian Brothers Fight Club, which Mr Difloriano co-founded and to which Mr Stefanovic reportedly had links. 

Members of the fight club are mainly of Catholic-Italian descent, hence the reference to Saint Michael, and share a common interest in Muay Thai boxing.  

Mr Difloriano and Mr Stefanovic lived next to each other for several years and ran the fight club together, according to 7News.

What caused the argument between the pair and the subsequent shootings remained unclear.  

Saint Michael Fight Club made headlines in 2014 when one of its members Diego Carbone shot dead father-of-two Brad Dillon, 25, on a busy street in Leichhardt.

Carbone's cousin Antonio Bagnato, who was also a Fight Club member, flew to Thailand shortly after that shooting.

Bagnato was sentenced to death for the murder of Hells Angel bikie Wayne Schneider in Thailand in 2015 but had his sentence reduced. He remains in jail. 

Alexander Stefanovich, 36, had also been shot on the same day and died on the way to hospital (pictured, sheets are held up to block the view as Difloriano is taken into the ambulance)
