Apple announced last week that it would be hosting a live virtual event on September 15 at 1pm ET, but without any details about what viewers could expect.

However, many assumed it would be the unveiling of the new Apple Watch and that is exactly what they got. 

The Apple Watch Series 6 is the first design to come in a stunning blue aluminum finish and the firm's own Product Red, and users can choose from seven new bands when ordered.

There are new faces, including Memoji, that users can customize to fit their needs and personality.

The biggest update is the sensors that measure oxygen levels, which Apple is using to partner with healthcare professionals and networks to conduct larger studies.

These studies will investigate how to control asthma to managing heart diseases to monitoring coronavirus symptoms. 

The Series 6 is also 26 percent faster than its predecessors and is equipped with a high-performance dual processor used in the iPhone 11 - just redesigned into a smaller version. 

It has Apple's in-house A13 chip and is said to be the biggest update to the device's performance since the Series 4, released in 2018.
