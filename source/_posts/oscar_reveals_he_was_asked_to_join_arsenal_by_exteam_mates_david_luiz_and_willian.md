Oscar has revealed that his former Chelsea team-mates and compatriots David Luiz and Willian wanted him to join them at Arsenal this summer.

Winger Willian joined his old pal Luiz at the Gunners after joining on a free transfer following his departure from the Blues.

The trio played together for a number of years at Chelsea and enjoyed success and now Oscar has disclosed that Luiz and Willian asked him to make the move to Arsenal this summer.

'They called me, they had to call me. Because we have good communication. Sometimes I talk to them. They said 'come to Arsenal, come here',' he told Fox Sports Brasil.

'But for me it's a little more difficult. I have a contract with Shanghai, it's a little more difficult to leave.'

Oscar spent five years at Stamford Bridge before switching to China and currently plies his trade at Shanghai SIPG.

However the two-time Premier League has not ruled out a return to Europe in the future and has insisted his first choice would be to go back to Chelsea.

'I really want to go back to Europe. [But] Not now. At the moment I'm well here in China, I still have my contract here, which I hope to fulfil,' he added.Â 

'Of course the first club I'd choose if I could go back to Europe is Chelsea, for sure, which is the club that I built a very beautiful history with.

'And when I was a child I watched the Italian league a lot because there were many Brazilians there. So there are some teams from Italy that I like a lot, like Inter, Milan.

'So I'd think about going to the Italian league if I return one day.'
