The incredible moment more than 20 enormous crocodiles bared their teeth as they fought over a dead cow has been caught on camera.

Michele Bain watched the scene unfold from her houseboat in the crocodile-infested waters of Corroboree Billabong, south-east of Darwin, with her husband Mark on September 2.

The amateur photographer from Palmerston said she saw long tracks in the bush where the the four-metre reptile had dragged its victim into the water.

Michele Bain was in the crocodile-infested waters of Corroboree Billabong, south-east of Darwin, when she saw the scene unfold

She said the cow was definitely dead by the time it was pulled into the water and appeared bloated, as though it had been drowned, with chunks of 'black, slimy flesh, like the skin of a seal'.

As the crocodile feasted on the cow, more crocodiles slowly began to emerge.

'There weren't too many when we first went past, but when we came back there were about 20 crocodiles above the water,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

The couple were alarmed when they realised more were lurking beneath the surface, waiting to steal a chunk of meat. 

As the crocodile devoured the cow, more crocodiles slowly began to emerge until there were more than 20

Mrs Bain said the reptile started gnashing its teeth to scare the others away, ripping raw chunks of flesh off its victim (pictured)

'One by one, they would try to have a piece of beef and and the crocodile that won it would chase them away.' 

Mrs Bain said it started gnashing its teeth to scare the others away, ripping raw chunks of flesh off its victim.  

'There was lots of fighting and splashing - we've been going to that spot for years and we've never seen anything like it.'

Crocodiles usually spend a week devouring a large mammal, but Mrs Bain said the cow was completely gone by the following morning

'There was lots of fighting and splashing - we've been going to that spot for years and we've never seen anything like it,' she said

Crocodiles usually spend a week devouring a large mammal, but Mrs Bain said the cow was completely gone by the following morning - less then 24 hours later.

Despite being surrounded by killer crocodiles, the couple maintained they weren't afraid. 

'I had a long lens, and I've been taking photos for so long and I was in a secure boat,' she said.

'You've just got to be croc-wise and not get too close.'
