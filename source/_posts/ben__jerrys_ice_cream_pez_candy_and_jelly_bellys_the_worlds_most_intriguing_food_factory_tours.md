They went on to build their first factory in 1985, which is located 30 minutes away in Waterbury, and it remains the main factory to this day. Its tours attract fans from all over the world.

Pez candy, Connecticut 

There are self-guided tours running at the Pez candy factory throughout the week 

Pez Candy was invented in Vienna, Austria, by Eduard Haas III as an alternative to smoking. The name Pez comes from the German word for peppermint, 'PfeffErminZ' taking the P from the first letter, E from the middle and Z from the last letter to form the word Pez. The original rectangular-shaped dispenser held 12 pieces of candy -the same number as today.

In 1952, Pez landed in the U.S. and the main factory was opened in Orange, Connecticut, in 1973. Due to the candy's popularity, a visitors centre opened in 2011 with more than 4,000 square feet dedicated to the sweet treat. 

There are self-guided tours running at the factory throughout the week, with visitors able to peek into the production areas and watch the goods being packaged up. Videos also reveal how the patented Pez dispenser is made.  

Cape Cod Chips, Massachusetts 

On July 4, 1980, Steve Bernard and his brother, Jude made their dream of making crunchy, healthy potato chips a reality. 

They set up a small storefront in Hyannis, Massachusetts, where their chips quickly became a local favourite and they started selling further afield from Canada to the Mid-Atlantic.

In 1985 they opened their doors to the public and the free factory tours remain popular today. Visitors can see the whole chip-making process from potato to bag and the tour ends at the gift shop where free samples are dished out. 

Tabasco sauce, Louisiana 

The Tabasco sauce factory is open to visitors, with the $5.50 tours including stops at the pepper greenhouse, barrel warehouse, salt mine, and the bottling plant

Tabasco sauce was the brainchild of Edmund McIlhenny who lived on Avery Island, Louisiana, and was looking for a way to spice up the bland food he found in the region. 

He launched his pepper sauce in 1868 labelling it 'Tabasco' - a word of Mexican Indian origin believed to mean 'place where the soil is humid' or 'place of the coral or oyster shell' - and in 1870, he secured a patent with sales spreading across the U.S. and to Europe.

The company is still family-owned and Avery Island is open to visitors with the $5.50 factory tours including stops at the pepper greenhouse, barrel warehouse, salt mine, and the bottling plant. Fans will also see how the condiment - made simply from red peppers, salt and high-quality distilled vinegar - is carefully blended for the perfect injection of heat.
