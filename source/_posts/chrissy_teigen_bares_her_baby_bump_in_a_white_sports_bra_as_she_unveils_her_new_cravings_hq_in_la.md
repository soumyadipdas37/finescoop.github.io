Since the launch of her first cookbook in 2016, Chrissy Teigen's beloved Cravings brand has evolved into a food lover's empire.

And on Sunday, the expectant star gave her 31.1 million Instagram fans a first look at her 'nearly' completed Cravings headquarters in Los Angeles. 

As she unveiled various areas of her lavish workspace, the mother-of-two flaunted her burgeoning baby bump in a new post with interior designer, Jake Arnold.

In the snap, the wife of John Legend stripped down to a white sports bra, as she ditched her aqua blazer, and unzipped her pants to emphasis her growing stomach. 

Meanwhile, Arnold cradled Teigen's midriff with one hand, as she jokingly captioned the shot, 'I love our baby.' 

'A true labor of love. One of the best parts of my job is working with dreamers, people who think big and manifest their passions,' the LA-based British interior designer wrote on his own Instagram account of designing Cravings HQ.

The beauty couldn't resist laying out on the dreamy countertop in front of a bowl of limes, while giving a glimpse of her trendy white heels. 

'I cannot explain what this photo means to me. So many dreams come together,' said of the smoldering image of herself

The businesswoman then addressed her dreams finally becoming reality in a reflective post.

'I cannot explain what this photo means to me. So many dreams come together,' she said of the smoldering image of herself. 'Very random idea, every silly night text to the team, the little blog from 14 years ago, all manifested there to feed you is fulfilled.'

Additionally, she shared a picture of her four-year-old daughter Luna sitting on her lap, before joining Legend and their son Miles, two, on a furry couch.

She later revealed that the baby, who comes after she and John welcomed Luna and Miles through IVF, was conceived naturally and a surprise for the couple.

'It was a surprise. A little quarantine surprise, I guess you could say,' John shared with Craig Melvin while on the Today Show.

'But we're very excited, and we're grateful for all the well-wishes we've gotten from people all around the world. Thank you so much.'
