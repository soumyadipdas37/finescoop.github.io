Just when you thought sending five girls home was dramatic, Osher Günsberg's final announcement on Wednesday night's episode of The Bachelor took the series to another level. 

Following the rose ceremony, the 41-year-old host broke the news to Locky Gilbert and the remaining women that production had to be shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Fans immediately flocked to Twitter, claiming Osher's performance was so dramatic that he deserved an award. 

'Give it a Logie right now!' On Wednesday, fans praised Osher Günsberg's performance on The Bachelor after he announced production must come to a halt amid the COVID-19 pandemic 

'Osher scores a Gold Logie and Academy Award with one speech,' wrote one user. 

Another commented: 'Watching Osher do this "we have to stop production" rehearsed scene of #TheBachelorAU is wildly dramatic & hilarious.' 

A third wrote: 'Osher’s not even whispering. The intensity. Give it a Logie right now.'

Meanwhile, others said they wouldn't mind hearing the pandemic news from Osher. 

'Out of all the people in the world to break the news about the pandemic, hearing it from Osher would not be the worst tbh,' commented one fan.  

Another wrote: '@oshergunsberg can you please give us the covid updates from now on? I’d be more inclined to listen to those live press conferences if you can in like "Australia... I have some important news" and we all yell "hello osher" at our tv.'

Shock elimination: In a move no-one saw coming, Locky (pictured) sent home Areeba Emmanuel, Charley Bond, Gemma White, Laura Calleri and Marg Zogoulas in a multiple elimination

Meanwhile, Wednesday night's episode saw Locky send home Areeba Emmanuel, Charley Bond, Gemma White, Laura Calleri and Marg Zogoulas in a shock elimination.     

Areeba, 25, didn't hold back, saying this year's Bachelor clearly had a penchant for 'basic girls'.

'This is definitely the first time I have ever been rejected by a guy. I don't care because he obviously likes basic girls, and that's not me. I ain't basic,' she pouted.

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel Ten
