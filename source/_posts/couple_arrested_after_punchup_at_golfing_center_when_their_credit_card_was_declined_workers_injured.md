A couple were arrested after they were caught on camera assaulting two employees at a putting golf venue in Ohio on Wednesday night. 

A man and woman, Shaquan Foreman Antoin, 25,  and Dekotha Arnold, 20, have been charged with assault and resisting arrest after the punchup at the location in Independence . 

The incident happened just before 11pm after Antoin's card declined.

After settling his bill in cash, he then called a worker at the venue an obscenity.

The employee subsequently told the pair that the manager would be brought and they would have to leave the venue as a result of their behavior, while another employee asked the pair to calm down.

Arnold suddenly flipped and allegedly hit the woman several times in the face while Antoin set about punching both of the workers a number of times before the couple ran out, according to police.

Video shows the brutal fight with Antoin seemingly punching the female employees before picking up what appears to be cash that was on the floor and then running for the exit.  

The couple was eventually restrained by others while Arnold continued to punch one worker in the head multiple times before police arrived. 

'Police said the two victims had visible injuries, including a black eye and a chipped tooth,' according to Fox 8. 'The manager told police he thought the one server was unconscious when he saw her on the ground.'
