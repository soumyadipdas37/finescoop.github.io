The daughter of Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise has showed off her bold new look on Instagram.

Isabella 'Bella' Cruise, 27, took a selfie on Sunday to reveal her quirky textured haircut, complete with blue streaks. 

Bella channeled rock chick vibes in a leather coat, which she teamed up with an animal print shirt.

She completed her look with peace sign earrings, a delicate silver ring nose piercing and designer shades.

And it appears her followers were rather impressed with her new look, as they quickly inundated her post with comments.

'Hair colour is,' one person wrote. While a second commented: 'Love it also, you skin looks soooo freaking good.'

Low-key: The new post comes just weeks after she surprised her Instagram followers when she uploaded a mirror selfie while posing in a stylish baker boy cap and black jacket 

The former art student has chosen to live her life away from the spotlight, and usually only posts images of her drawings on social media.

Bella, who describes herself in her Instagram bio as a 'human' and 'artist', has also showcased her photography skills by sharing scenic travel pictures.

Her account includes a link to her online store, where she sells T-shirts, phone cases and prints bearing her quirky designs, starting from $25.

Bella was adopted by her parents Nicole and Tom in 1992.

Her biological younger brother, 25-year-old Connor Cruise, was also adopted by the Hollywood couple three years later.

Nicole, 53, and Tom, 58, divorced in 2001 after more than a decade of marriage, when Bella was just eight years old.
