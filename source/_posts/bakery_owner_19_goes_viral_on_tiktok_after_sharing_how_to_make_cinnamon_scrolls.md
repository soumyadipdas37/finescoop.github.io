'I start with a sheet of rolled out brioche, then cover it in a cinnamon buttercream,' Morgan said in the video.

After evenly spreading the mixture, he rolls the thick dough on top of itself before slicing and baking in the oven until golden brown.

The rolls are then coated in a sweet vanilla glaze before being sold to customers in the bakery.
