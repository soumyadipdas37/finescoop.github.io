She was branded a 'fame w***e' by Made In Chelsea's Melissa on Monday night's episode of the show. 

But Zara McDermott seemed to be trying to move on from the drama on Instagram on Monday when she shared an incredible bikini picture. 

Posing by the water's edge from a recent holiday in Cyprus, she reclined while looking at the camera, with wet hair, while wearing a floral white two-piece.  

Nothing to see here: Zara McDermott posed in a bikini by the water's edge in Cyprus on Instagram on Monday as she moved on from being branded a 'fame w***e' on Made In Chelsea

She captioned the image with the words: 'Meet you at the waterfall.' 

During the latest episode of Made In Chelsea, it seemed as though Melissa had a lot to say about her.  

Aghast at the rumours about Tiff and Sam’s alleged recent provocative chat, she had said: 'If Harry’s ex talked about their sex life to him I would literally vomit in my mouth.'

Oh no Zara: Liv played Zara a voice note that Melissa sent Tiff in which she calls Zara a ‘fame w***e’ on Monday's Made In Chelsea 

There was also a rumour that Tiff phoned Sam at 3AM the other night in the style of a booty call, at which Melissa is equally appalled. 

Later, Sam is encircled by bikini-clad Liv, Zara and Tiff, who try to hash out the details of this alleged encounter between Sam and Tiff.

Needless to say this ends in disaster when Liv chucks a drink at Sam and demands he ‘get the f**k out of this house’.

Verity and Tristan try to clear the air and it goes like this: ‘How do you feel?’ ‘I don’t know how I feel!’ ‘How DO you feel?’ ‘I don’t know!’ 

Liv then plays Zara a voice note that Melissa sent Tiff in which she calls Zara a ‘fame w***e’. 

Zara is absolutely appalled at the nastiness of all these girls. 

It has since come out that she cheated on Sam while doing The X Factor, and she and Sam have since split. 

Zara is said to be doing all she can to get back with Sam but he has since been spotted on a date with a mystery lady, so it's not looking too promising. 

Made In Chelsea continues at 9PM on E4 next Monday.

Hmm: Zara is absolutely appalled at the nastiness of all these girls

All over now: Of course, it has since come out that she cheated on Sam while doing The X Factor and the two have now gone their separate ways
