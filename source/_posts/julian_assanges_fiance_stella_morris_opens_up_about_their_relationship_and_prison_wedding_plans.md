The mother of Julian Assange's children has opened up about the couple's prison wedding plans and her push for Australian citizenship.

South African-born lawyer Stella Morris and Assange began dating in 2015 after she helped work on a legal bid to halt his extraditions.  

The 49-year-old Australian faces espionage charges over the leaking of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. intelligence documents. 

He was also wanted in Sweden after being accused of rape. Assange always denied the sex allegations, which have now been dropped.

Gabriel, three, and his brother Max, one, were conceived while Assange was hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.

'It was a rational decision, I was 33 at the time and I knew I wanted children and it was faith in our love for each other and the certainty, a feeling that this was right,' Ms Morris told Sydney Morning Herald.  

The WikiLeaks founder was granted political asylum by Ecuador in 2012 until April 2019 when he was dragged out and taken to prison. 

Ms Morris said she plans to marry Assange outside Belmarsh Prison in London's outskirts by Christmas this year.

The couple's children visited Assange in prison last month and Ms Morris tries to keep him 'present' in their lives by talking about him and watching videos.  

'I don't want Julian to become a martyr. We're a family, he's not a symbol to us. He's part of ... he's Daddy. So I just tell them that Daddy's coming home,' she said. 

But Ms Morris is aware there is a chance the children will never be reunited with their father again.  

She would love to move to Australia - as long as the government can protect her family. 

'I'll live wherever he is safe and that's why I want Australia to tell us that he will be safe there,' she said.

Ms Morris said she asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison for political intervention but claims she was told they won't protect Assange from extradition.  

Assange's partner previously lifted the lid on how the couple managed to have children while he was holed up inside the embassy.

'We grew closer and became friends and watched movies together and I just loved spending time with him. It was very romantic and cautious and very sweet,' she told 60 Minutes earlier this year.

'It wasn't easy but when you're with someone you love you can make impossible situations possible.'

When Gabriel was conceived in 2016, Assange had been inside the embassy for four years and was thought to be under constant surveillance by American security services.

But Ms Morris said she and Assange - who became engaged in 2017 - conceived both their sons in rooms of the embassy that didn't have CCTV cameras.

'Julian had private spaces, his bedroom and office had no cameras,' she said.

'But when I got pregnant the first time there were microphones everywhere, so I had to write it down on a piece of paper to tell him.

'We loved each other, and we wanted to start a family. All these other circumstances would change but that was a certainty. I got pregnant and we were over the moon,' she said.

Ms Morris was able to hide both her pregnancies from authorities and the media, who still weren't privy to any romantic relationship between the pair.

'I just piled on layers [of clothes] and complained about getting fat to hide it,' she said.
