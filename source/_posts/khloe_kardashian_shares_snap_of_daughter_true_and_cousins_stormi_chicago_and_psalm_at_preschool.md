Kim purchased them for her two daughters, North and Chicago and her nieces Penelope, Dream, Stormi and True, but someone noticed there were two more bags left, which she revealed was for a back up measure in case there are more girls in the family. 

She explained: 'Oh wait I kept one for myself and extras for the future lol.'

Stormi, who was 22 months at the time, picked it and swung it over her shoulder, which Kylie shared to her Instagram.

Kylie previously said the $7.7K bag, which was a gift from older sister Kourtney Kardashian, was something she wanted to give Stormi as her first bag.   

In a YouTube video of her closet, Kylie said: 'Kourtney gave me this, which I think is super cute. I was really surprised, because I feel like Kourtney never really cares about Christmas gifts, so when she gave me this last year, it was really special.' 

Adding: 'This one, I'm definitely going to let Stormi wear, probably, when she says, 'Mommy I want to carry a purse." So this is probably going to be her first purse.' 

In the same video, Kylie revealed that she plans on giving her daughter the vintage Louis Vuitton Sac HL Mini Speedy bag that she has had since she was a child - gifted to her by mom Kris Jenner. The bag is worth approximately $620.

'My mom gave these to me and Kendall when we were like super babies,' she explains, 'so I am definitely going to give this to Stormi.'
