He popped the question on a romantic holiday in Greece.  

And James Dunmore shared a snap taken moments after he asked Lucy Watson to be his wife in a sweet post on Thursday. 

Taking to Instagram, the former Made In Chelsea star mused: 'As days go, this was a good one'.

In the shot, the newly-engaged couple snuggled up to one another on board a boat as they watched the sunset. 

Lucy, 29, looked incredible in a brown bikini that showcased her toned physique as she toasted the engagement with a glass of champagne. 

Cheekily, James, 29, was seen squeezing his new fiancée's derriere as she rested on his lap.

Finally: Lucy and James have been going strong ever since meeting on the E4 series back in 2015 and decided to take their romance to the next level whilst holidaying in Greece

Toasting to the occasion with glasses of champagne, the vegan restaurateur enthused she was having 'the best day ever' as they watched the sun set. 

Lucy later revealed that the surprise proposal also helped clear up why James had been so insistent that they get an early night the day before. 

Sharing a picture of the pair heading out, she penned: 'the night before @jamesdunmore proposed & I decided to get white girl wasted. The concern on his face & forcing me to bed all makes sense now [sic]'.

Lucy and James have been going strong ever since meeting on the E4 series back in 2015, following her ill-fated flings with Andy Jordan, Jamie Laing, Spencer Matthews and Oliver Proudlock.

The loved-up duo left the show just a year after embarking on a relationship and bought their first home in London in August 2017.

Nowadays, the influencer focuses on her accessory brand Creature Jewellery and vegan ventures, while the hunk is signed to Models 1 Management.
