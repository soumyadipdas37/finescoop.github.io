Red apples are losing their colour and crunch as climate change threatens to wipe out the popular variety.

Scientists are now working hard to save the apple of choice for many fruit lovers across the globe 

Dr Richard Volz, a New Zealand-based food researcher, said growers in northern Spain have been having issues with their red apples for years due to high summer temperatures.

Growers say rising temperatures are causing the colour to fade and the fruit to lose its crunch.

'The hotter temperatures mean the red colour of traditional varieties does not develop as it should,' he told the New Zealand Herald.

'The texture goes soft – and doesn't give you that famously crunchy feel.'

Apple colour comes from the certain genes in the apple skin and sets of enzymes which work together to turn molecules into pigments called anthocyanins.

Enzyme levels are controlled by a transcription factor – a protein that regulates how much a gene is expressed – called MYB10.

As temperatures soar the MYB10 and anthocyanin levels crash, meaning the produce fails to reach its typical vibrancy.

Mr Volz and his team have been working to develop a red apple that can be grown in warmer climates. 

While the first commercial plantings of the new apple trees will begin early next year in Spain, consumers will have to wait another three years before they get a taste.

'A new commercial variety is the culmination of years of testing to make sure we have a tree that produces fruit people want to eat, that we can grow and store the fruit in a way that will make sure the eating experience is consistent, and that growers can manage their orchards appropriately,' Mr Volz said.
