Bake Off fans are eagerly-anticipating the return of the show on Tuesday. 

And a teaser for tonight's show proves viewers have lots to be excited about, as the baking hopefuls are seen getting in quite the tizz about their sweet treats, with one baker's version of Louis Theroux's head becoming a point of mockery.

The Channel 4 baking contest, now in its 11th series, will welcome 12 home-bakers to the tent with the first show-stopping challenge to create their hero out of sponge and in the teaser for Tuesday's show, the tent looks to be hotting up.  

It's back! The first episode of the new series of GBBO sees pantomime producer Lottie, 31, mocked for her showstopper take on Louis Theroux's head 

During the new teaser, Retirement living leader Linda, 61, seems to find the funny side as she exclaims: 'Surprising how the time just flies when you're having fun', before an alarmed Lottie said: 'Who just said they were having fun!' 

The showstoppers see the narration say: 'Engineering turns to artistry'. 

Lottie continued to feel the pressure as she made her challenging showstopper - which was supposed to be an image of Louis Theroux - but Noel Fielding said looks like a 'death mask'. 

Elsewhere in the showstopper challenge, accountant Hemine, 39, from London, creates a tribute to the Black Panther film star Lupita Nyong'o.

Louis... is that you? Lottie's attempt at recreating Louis' head don't go down well

Digital manager Laura, 31, looked to be feeling the heat in the kitchen in the clip

The amateur baker crafted the naked shoulders and bosom of the actress, 37, with presenter Noel Fielding commenting: 'I don’t think I’ve ever fancied a cake before, but I slightly do now.' 

Meanwhile accounting and finance student Peter, 20, who is the youngest in the line-up, creates a baked portrait of six-time Olympic champion cyclist Sir Chris Hoy. 

However the baker was left red-faced when judge Pure Leith, 80, remarks: 'I'm loving the helmet.' Aside from the baking innuendoes, the Channel 4 show has also caused a stir with the return of the 'well-endowed' squirrel mascot.

The Mirror have also revealed that pharmacy dispenser Sura, 31, comes face-to-face with a fly and as she attempted to swat away the pest she knocks over some of the work from security guard Dave, 30. 

Rodent: Fans were left shocked after the show has brought back an animated tribute to the saucy squirrel in their advert which was cut following the 2011 series two final

As she breaks down following the gaffe, she said: 'I’m so sorry. Oh my god. I’m so sorry there was a fly, I went to shoo it away and I knocked it'. 

Noel and Matt soon swoop in to support the bereft hopeful.  

Earlier in the week and before the latest clip was released, fans were left shocked after the show has brought back an animated tribute to the saucy squirrel in their advert which was cut following the 2011 series two final.

The rodent graced the screens up until the series two final in 2011 where he was subject to a lingering camera shot.

However Great British Bake Off bosses sacked the 'full-frontal' squirrel for a pheasant for the 2016 series. But fans have gone nuts after the popular mascot has returned on the advert for the show in cartoon form.

Haha! During the new teaser, Retirement living leader Linda, 61, seems to find the funny side as she exclaims: 'Surprising how the time just flies when you're having fun', before an alarmed Lottie said: 'Who just said they were having fun!' 

The ad is in the form of a vintage-style tea towel featuring the slogan 'Bake Off's Back' and an emblem to the masculine squirrel in a gold frame holding a gherkin.

Care assistant Dwight McClean, 34, spotted the advert at a bus stop in Hounslow, West London, and told The Sun: 'It doesn’t go with the Bake Off theme. It’s something that’s pornographic.

The upcoming series took place at Down Hall Hotel in Essex after five years of filming at Welford Park in Berkshire, with all cast and crew members undergoing regular COVID-19 testing in an isolation bubble amid the pandemic.

Be careful! Diagnostic radiographer Loriea, 27, was an image of concentration when crunch time arrived 

Producers said they drew up a list of safety rules 'longer than the Bible' before filming started for the new socially-distanced series with Paul Hollywood's signature handshake given the green light despite fears of spreading the virus and claims it could be replaced with an elbow bump.

At the height of lockdown, the hit Channel 4 series signed an exclusive deal with luxury Down Hall Hotel and Spa in Essex, located on 110 acres of land, to hire it out in late July for the entire series.

The Observer reported that the country house and hotel, just a stone's throw from celebrity chef Paul's £1 million Grade II listed farmhouse in Kent, allowed the show to book it out on a self-catering basis with 25 members of staff on hand to help out.

I want to bake three.. cakes! The show's judges and presenters posed for a promotional snap in the theme of the iconic Queen II album cover

The popular show had been scheduled to go into production back in April, before the pandemic, and subsequent lockdown, scuppered all plans.

The publication claims that contestants were then allowed to move into the hotel with their partners, children or pet pooches - if they wished to do so - with measures put in place for child and dog care on set while filming for six weeks. 

The hit show is usually shot over a 12 week period with bakers travelling to and from their homes
