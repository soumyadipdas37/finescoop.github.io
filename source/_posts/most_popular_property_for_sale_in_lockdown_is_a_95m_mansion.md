The appetite for window shopping for an ultra-expensive home stepped up during lockdown, property website Rightmove suggested, as the most popular home for sale went from a £3.5million mansion to a £9.5million one.

It revealed the most popular property for sale at the beginning of lockdown, along with the most viewed one this week - five months on. 

While there is a large difference in price between the two properties, they both share a price tag that runs into millions of pounds.

At the start of lockdown the most viewed home for sale was a £3.5million Cheshire mansion, whereas now it is a £9.5million one. 

Rightmove's most popular house for sale is currently this Essex mansion costing an eye-watering £9.5million

The global pandemic and economic uncertainly has not stopped people dreaming about living in a millionaire's mansion - even if they can't afford to buy one and it remains a pipe dream.

Indeed, it seems lockdown has increased people's longing for a ultra-luxurious house surrounded by acres of land. 

Rightmove said it most popular property for sale this week is a mansion with an eye-watering price tag of £9.5million.

It compares to Rightmove's most viewed property for sale at the beginning of lockdown on March 23. That house also had a multi-million asking price, but cost significantly less at £3.5million.

Rightmove's property expert Miles Shipside said: 'The one thing that has remained constant throughout the challenges of the last six months is the British public's obsession with property.

'People love peeking inside millionaire mansions and dreaming about the homes they'd buy if they won the lottery.

'This is clear to see with the most viewed homes from the start of lockdown and the end of August - both are genuine fairy tale properties that allow people to escape reality for a few minutes in their day.'

The most viewed property on Rightmove this week, with its £9.5million price tag, is in Benfleet, Essex, near Southend-on-Sea.

With space and gardens becoming highly sought-after features among homebuyers during lockdown, this property fits the bill.

The detached home has five generous bedrooms - all with ensuite bathrooms, and a triple height entrance hall, along with three acres of land.

The main bedroom is equally impressive, covering some 40 ft with a seating area, dressing rooms and an en-suite bathroom.

The house spreads across four floors, and the top two floor bedroom suites also both have dressing rooms - with one accessed by the property's second lift.

Downstairs, the kitchen covers 47 ft by 45 ft, and has a lift to the basement utility rooms. The entertainment area is also in the basement and includes a bar, a cinema and a games room. The house is on the market via estate agents Scott & Stapleton.

In contrast to the most popular property on Rightmove this week, a £3.5million house took that title at the beginning of lockdown. It is still currently available to buy.

It is in Cheshire's Alderley Edge, which is home to several footballers and to TV's The Real Housewives of Cheshire.

It is entered via electric gates and has a long driveway that approaches the house, which has two towers. Inside, there are six bedrooms, spacious living areas and a swimming pool.

The Mobile Agents, handling the sale, described the property as 'stunning'. It said: 'It's a fairytale castle. Sitting proudly on top of a hill within walking distance of Alderley Edge this property is both unique as it is stunning.

'What parent couldn't resist the temptation to buy this divine offering for their little darlings.

'Once upon a refurbishment ago this castle did have a moat. but now it has a gorgeous swimming pool. It boosts two towers with accommodation over three floors.'
