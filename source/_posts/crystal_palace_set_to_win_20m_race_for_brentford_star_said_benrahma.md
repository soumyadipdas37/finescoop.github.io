Crystal Palace look to have a clear path to sign Said Benrahma from Brentford after their major rivals pulled out the race to land the winger.

Aston Villa and West Ham had also been keen on the 25-year-old but their interest has faded in recent weeks.

According to The Sun, that leaves Palace in line for a £20million swoop for the Algerian, with the London club keen to avoid going into a bidding war.

Crystal Palace are reportedly favourites to land Said Benrahma from Brentford for £20m

Benrahma was a key man to helping the Bees to the Championship play-offs last term

Benrahma has been a star at Brentford since joining the club two years ago, proving key to their march into the play-offs last term, but has ambitions on moving up to the Premier League having settled in London.

With Palace having recently landed another talented forward in Eberechi Eze from QPR, Roy Hodgson's side are hoping picking up the best talent in the Championship that could help them avoid a Premier League relegation battle this term.

The Eagles' from plummeted after lockdown to leave them in the lower reaches of mid-table having previously been fighting for a European spot.

But the winger's arrival could lead to the exit of ex-England international Andros Townsend

But while the potential arrival of Benrahma does mean more attacking options on the wing, it does put pressure on the future of the likes of Andros Townsend.

Should the finances fit, the Eagles may even be tempted to sell the former England international in a bid to freshen up the faces at Selhurst Park. 

The report also claims another star could be on his way out of the Eagles dressing room, with Club Brugge lining up a £10million swoop for Christian Benteke. 

The Eagles got their Premier League campaign off to a perfect start on Saturday with a 1-0 win over Southampton.
