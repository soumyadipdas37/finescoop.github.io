Nicole later addressed the shocking moment on her Instagram Stories, where she also added she was 'keeping it real' by sporting a pair of slippers.

Discussing Mickey's unmasking, she said: 'For the first time ever in Masked Singer history he just came out and unmasked [himself], we didn't even vote. He just said look, I'm going to sing my song, and then I'm going to take off my mask right now.'

Talking about the performance itself, she added: 'He actually sounded really cool, he had this older very seasoned, texture voice and the performance was really heartfelt because he dedicated to one of his dear friends who is no longer with us. So I thought the sentiment was really beautiful.

'But balls to the wall! Anything goes on season for guys.'  

Mickey shocked viewers of The Masked Singer on Wednesday when he voluntarily pulled off his Gremlin mask and eliminated himself from the show.

It was the first time in the programme's history a contestant has ever unmasked before the voting round at the end and no one knew what to do.

Moments earlier, the star of The Wrestler, 68, had sung Ben E. King's Stand By Me as the Gremlin, a purple beast with shaggy fur.

First time: It was the first time in the program's history a contestant has ever unmasked before the voting round at the end and no one knew what to do

His spacey, off-tempo delivery had panelist Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, 47, asking fellow panelist Robin Thicke, 43, 'Is he like 100 years old?'

When the actor finished, he waited three minutes before deciding it was too hot to stay in costume, and he was over it anyway.

'I wanna take this off right now,' Mickey informed show host Nick Cannon, 39, pulling wildly at his mask as everyone nearby begged him to stop.

'Gremlin, you can't do that!' Nick insisted. 'It's not that part of the show yet!'

The panellists stood up at their table, imploring him to wait, as Nicole, yelled, 'But we haven't even voted!' and Jenny shouted, 'What is happening?'

Nick called the show's Men in Black for help, saying, 'We've lost control! It's the Gremlin's show!'

With that, Mickey finally yanked off his mask and whipped it into the studio's seats, grinning.

No vote: Mickey said he was hot and wanted to take off his mask

Sly grin: Mickey finally yanked off his mask and whipped it into the studio's seats, grinning

'Oh my God! I can't believe it!' screamed Jenny, the only panellist to have guessed it was him.

Mickey grinned, and the mark of a woman's lipsticked kiss could be seen on his cheek.

'Man, you're such a legend,' Nick told the 9½ Weeks star. 'What would make you do The Masked Singer?'

Total chaos: Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong and Nicole Scherzinger went wild during the chaotic ending

Correct guess: 'Oh my God! I can't believe it!' screamed Jenny, the only panelist to have guessed that Gremlin was Mickey

'I was in the neighborhood,' Mickey cracked. 'I do like the show. I've watched like, four episodes. When they asked, ''Would you be interested?'' So I watched from the very beginning and all that s***, you know.'

Mickey's performance garnered at least one rave, from Nicole, who said, 'I loved his voice. It had so many layers, and it was like, all the texture in it. It was yummy! That's some seasoning!'

The Barfly star had initially started to walk offstage during the applause after his song, leading Nick to joke, 'I don't know where The Gremlin's going, but keep it going for him!'

Loved it: Mickey's performance garnered at least one rave, from Nicole, who said, 'I loved his voice. It had so many layers, and it was like, all the texture in it. It was yummy! That's some seasoning!'

Barfly star: The Barfly star earlier shared clues referencing his former boxing career and the film Rumble Fish

Mickey returned to explain that he'd sung the song because it had also been performed by one of his best friends, the late Willy DeVille, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2009.

'I've missed him for a long, long time,' Mickey said, growing emotional. 'And I think the other night for some reason, Willy sent me down this song.'

In The Gremlin's pre-taped video, Mickey said, 'You may have heard I can be a bit combative, but I have a fluffy side, too.

'I adore all animals, long spins on the beach, a little feng shui, and bashing worthy opponents with foreign objects for maximum impact. 

'I also love to cook! If you like what you see, I'd love to have you for dinner. I mean, have you over for dinner.'

Late friend: Willy DeVille, shown in 1993, was friends with Mickey and the actor said his late friend inspired his performance on the Fox show

Swan song: The actor and Nick performed his song together

He was shown boxing with a shark, ironing a shirt, cutting carrots, and drinking 41 proof liquor.

It was ultimately revealed that the boxing shark referred to Mickey's past boxing career and his role in the 1983 film Rumble Fish, while the iron was a nod to his character Ivan Vanko in Iron Man 2, and the mention of liking to cook alluded to his pen name, Eddie Cook.

Jenny initially thought the fighting clues pointed to Rocky actor Sylvester Stallone, 74, before remembering audio she'd played of Mickey's voice on her radio show.

Fresh lipstick: Mickey had fresh red lipstick on his cheek after he unmasked

Robin thought The Gremlin was rocker Jerry Lee Lewis, 85, while panelist Ken Jeong, 51, felt it could be wrestler 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, 55.

When The Gremlin unmasked, Ken realized he was the Oscar nominee they'd all been told about at the top of the season, referring to Mickey's nod for 2009's The Wrestler.

Robin said he should have known it was Mickey, noting, 'We've hung out a few times together down in Miami,' as Mickey put his finger to his mouth and said, 'Shhhh.'
