She is set to star in the upcoming remake of the late 90s classic She's All That. 

And Addison Rae was spotted grabbing a bite with a pal at Toast Bakery Cafe in West Hollywood on Monday afternoon.

The 19-year-old, who happens to be one of Kourtney Kardashian's closest confidants, made sure to get in a gym session before her lunch date.

Addison showed off her taut tummy in a blue floral patterned sports bra and a pair of black high waisted leggings.

She threw on some grey New Balance trainers and wore a tie-dyed face mask over her mouth and nose.

The Tik Tok star looked noticeably makeup-free and had her lengthy brunette hair tied back into a low ponytail.

She accessorized her look with a gold chain choker and she carried the majority of her belongings in a black backpack.

Addison - born Addison Rae Easterling - had two iPhones in her hand, as well as her car keys.

She parked her custom white Jeep Wrangler in a spot across from the popular cafe and crossed the street with her pal by her side.

Despite the current COVID-19 pandemic, Addison is often spotted out and around Los Angeles.

Addison will soon grace screens as one of the leads in a new version of She's All That, titled He's All That.

The original teen comedy starred Freddie Prinze Jr. as a guy at the top of the social ladder at his high school who accepts a bet to transform a random nerdy girl (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a popular beauty.

The film, which was a box office success but received mixed reviews, was based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion and the subsequent musical adaptation My Fair Lady.

The gender roles are reversed in this upcoming adaptation, and Addison will play an influencer who tries to help a nerdy boy become the prom king.

Addison Rae entered the pop culture sphere in 2019 after gaining immense popularity on the social networking app Tik Tok.

The aspiring actress, who is originally from Lousiana, made the big move to Los Angeles in order to properly cultivate her undeniable social media stardom.

Since then, Addison has been signed to the renown talent agency WME and she has found her way into Kourtney Kardashian's elite inner circle.

Rae may be making an appearance in the upcoming season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which will be coming to a close next year after 20 seasons on E! 

She spoke with Entertainment Tonight on Friday and revealed that she would be open to making an appearance on KUWTK.

'I don't know. Who knows what the future kind of holds,' Rae said. 'I'm kind of just living life day by day and going through everything with a happy heart and humble mindset. It's all been really exciting,' she teased.
