She started the celebrations for her 23rd birthday days early with a party on Sunday.

And Jordyn Woods continued the pre-birthday festivities on Monday as she revealed her stunning figure in a revealing one-piece suit on Instagram.

The 22-year-old flaunted her curves while putting on a busty display in a low-cut white monokini.

Jordyn's one-piece suit from British luxury label House of CB featured a halter top and had criss-crossing thick straps covering her top.

The suit included a cut-out panel revealing her midriff, and the high-cut bottom highlighted her hourglass figure.

The 5ft9in beauty capped off her beach-ready outfit with a pair of ribbed white Chanel sandals and a floppy Jacquemus straw hat, while she showed off her braided hair.

'and it ain't even my birthday yet ..,' she captioned the photo, adding a white heart emoji.

Risky business: Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has now killed close to 200,000 Americans, Jordyn didn't wear a mask while hanging out with friends

On Sunday, Jordyn got ready for her party and revealed the decorations.

She showed off her cleavage in a scarlet crop top and matching bottoms while wearing a black Lack of Color bucket hat.

Once it was time to celebrate, she changed into an elegant green and white striped dress from Verge Girl.

Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has now killed close to 200,000 Americans, Jordyn didn't wear a mask while hanging out with friends or during her outings on Monday. 

Jordyn's birthday posts arrived after it was revealed that Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be ending in 2021 after airing 20 seasons over 14 years.

The model was formerly one of star Kylie Jenner's best friends, and the two often seemed inseparable, but Jordyn was cast out of the Kardashian–Jenner fold after it was revealed that Khloé Kardashian's cheating boyfriend Tristan Thompson had kissed her at a party.  

Last year, she appeared on Jada Pinkett Smith's Red Table Talk show on Facebook to admit kissing Tristan, though she claimed that it wasn't 'intimate.'  

She broke down during the interview, saying she was 'no homewrecker' and denying that she was the reason for Khloé and Tristan's split.

Following the revelations, her friend Kylie cut off contact.
