COVID-19 has directly affected spring 2021's sartorial landscape.

From contemporary brands to high-end labels, designers (including Tom Ford!) have embraced these unprecedented times by addressing our quarantine needs. 

We saw luxe loungewear, stylish sweatsuits and cozy knit separates on the runways in New York, Milan and Paris this month. But you don't have to wait until next season to look and feel your best while WFH. Wolf & Badger's Creative Director & Co-Founder, Henry Graham, reveals how you can get the look now.

In the moment: COVID-19 has directly affected spring 2021's sartorial landscape. From contemporary brands to high-end labels, designers (Tom Ford included!) have embraced these unprecedented times by addressing our quarantine needs

Cozy chic: We saw luxe loungewear, stylish sweatsuits and cozy knit separates come down almost all the runways in New York, Milan and Paris this month

The most surprising trend this season is 'pared down simplicity and elegance,' according to Wolf & Badger's Creative Director & Co-Founder, Henry Graham

Relaxed suiting: By now we've all learned that working from home effectively takes practice, discipline and the right outfit

By now we've all learned that working from home effectively takes practice and discipline. 

The most productive people don't roll out of bed and head straight to the computer in their pjs. They start their day by getting dressed in presentable clothes. 

The good news is that loungewear has come a long way so you can look great while still being comfortable in your makeshift home office.

And professional workwear including suits, blazers and slacks, have become less formal and more relaxed.  

'Dressing up is as important now than ever,' said Henry. To look chic in the most comfortable way possible, Henry recommends sleepwear from Not Just Pajama.  

Founded in London 2015 the brand creates luxurious silk sets that are as fashionable for indoor/outdoor wear as they are comfortable. 

From the sheets to the streets: 'Dressing up is as important now than ever,' said Henry. 'Loungewear has done really well for us.' Henry recommends sleepwear from Not Just Pajama





 





 

'Pared down simplicity and elegance,' is the most surprising trend this season said Henry. 'It works super well when transitioning from home to work or play.'

In addition to fabulous pajamas, the expert recommends 'knits in beautiful soft yarns.'

Boss, N21 and Drome styled silky pajama separates with knitwear at their spring 2021 presentations.

Henry suggests oversized styles to carry out the comfy cozy feel.  

'We have lots of amazing, neutral toned pieces made using luxe fabrics and subtle shapes. This season is going to be all about understated elegance.' 









 









 

 

As clothing categories are becoming more relaxed and effortless, so is footwear. 

'Mules are really trending right now, as are slip-ons,' shared Henry. 'They both work well for that casual, dressed-up look for a chic walk to the shops.' 

For style and versatility Henry favors Osay the label, Bala Di Gala and Atelier de Charlotte.

Fashion right now is functional. Designers have said said bye-bye to mini bags in favor of oversized carryalls that carry all. 

'I'm a huge fan of Kartu Studio,' said the expert.

And don't forget jewelry! A pair of statement earrings can turn a silk robe or casual two-piece set from meh to amazing!

The must-have accessory this fall? The face mask, of course! It's important to find a style that fits properly, is effective and suits your look.

Wolf & Badger has a wide selection from brands like Jessica Zoa, Adelina Rusu and NY Charisma.   

Carryall: As seen at Boss spring 2021, oversized bags are also trending

Street style: 'Pared down simplicity and elegance,' is the most surprising trend this season said Henry. 'It works super well when transitioning from home to work or play,' said Henry

While Wolf & Badger pays attention to runway trends, they carry brands from all over the world and are often ahead of the game.  

'Designers are selected based on their innovation of design, finish and quality of workmanship,' shared Henry.

'We also focus on brands that share our ethos of ethical and sustainable production.'

Polish brand AGGI offers and array of unique pieces (including face masks, cocktail dresses and tailored blazers) at affordable price points.   

 Babaloo jewelry celebrates women. Each piece is meant to evoke confidence and make the wearer feel as unique and wonderful as they are.  

For the girl who likes to stand out (in and out of quarantine), Paloma Lira Studio is the answer.

The brand was established in 2012 with the cultural and social changes of 60's, 70's & 80's and its influence nowadays as its muse. 

Established in 2016 True Decadence's  philosophy is centered around creating occasion wear in effortless silhouettes that celebrate femininity.
