A contestant on Channel 4's new reality show The Bridge is offering his social media followers X-rated services on OnlyFans, MailOnline can reveal. 

Zac Smith is one of 12 contenders on the show, narrated by James McAvoy, who must work together to construct a bridge with a chance of winning £100,000.

The Surrey native, 26, works as a stripper with the Dreamboys but also makes extra income by charging his followers to view his adult content on OnlyFans.

OnlyFans is a subscription service where users can charge people a monthly fee to view their content, with much of it being adult in nature. 

The site is popular with influencers and adult film stars who post pictures and videos that would not be allowed on other social media platforms and is also used by celebrities including Bella Thorne, Cardi B and Megan Barton Hanson. 

On his OnlyFans account, Zac currently charges $6.99 (£5.44) a month for users to see his profile which includes 'naked workouts', 'muscle worship' and 'fetish' content.

The dancer also offers his subscribers other opportunities to deplete their bank accounts, including an extra cost of $100 (£77) if they would like a 'custom' personalised video from him.

Zac offers PTV (pay-to-view) videos which are sent through private messages for $15 (£11) if old or $20 (£15) if new, while his most ardent fans can also get a 'personal pic' for $5 and a 'personal message' for $10 (£7). 

In addition, he offers subscription bundles of $23.98 (£18) to have access to his content for three months or $65.93 (£51) for 12 months.

Zac also gives his subscribers a link to his Amazon Wish List where he has a variety of clothing and mens fragrances listed that they can purchase for him. 

When contacted by MailOnline, a representative for Zac said: 'Zac is the Bear Grylls of the Bridge - he embraces all things nature and has bared all, known for his nature work outs in the buff.

'Zac, along with many other well known faces has an OnlyFans account - promoting nothing more than good healthy appetite for life and its natural pleasures.'

MailOnline has also contacted Channel 4 for comment.

Zac describes himself as a 'massive flirt' with 'alpha-male syndrome' and claims if he won the £100,000 cash prize, he would 'turn it into a million'. 

When asked how he will deal with arguments on the show, he said: 'If it's pointless bickering, there's no way I'm going to get involved.  

'They just need to get it off their chest. If it gets to where someone's being bullied, then I would step in, because I can't stand that kind of behaviour, but I wouldn't just get in the middle of an argument for the sake of me wanting to be the centre of attention.'

On The Bridge, contestants are given 20 days to construct an overpass together from the banks of a lake to an island 250 metres away.

However, the show is not as easy as it seems as contestants are met with a variety of twists and turns and 'moral dilemmas' as they try to complete the task. 

Other contenders taking part include TV presenter Trisha Goddard's daughter Billie, 30, who works as a publicist, with her famous mother said to be 'apprehensive' about her doing the show.

Also taking part is Tara, 39, a recent Covid-19 survivor who spent nine days in the Intensive Care Unit and took the opportunity to take part 'with both hands'. 

The Bridge, a five part series, has not been given an air date yet and is set to debut on Channel 4 in the coming weeks.
