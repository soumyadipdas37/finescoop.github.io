A dominatrix has insisted that people should 'accept this sort of behaviour' after her and her 'slave' were barred from a gastropub in Cumbria for public sadomasochistic display.

Dominatrix Lydia Chadwick, 30, had tied her 'slave' to a roof beam with a dog lead and spanked the masked person with a paddle on Sunday evening at The Mill in Ulverston - in full view of other diners. 

Customers who witnessed the sadomasochistic session filmed the bizarre episode and shared it online.

But Lydia reportedly defended her actions, telling The Sun: 'People should get out of the dark ages and accept this sort of behaviour.

'Most people are just treating it as a laugh.' 

A dominatrix and her 'slave' have been banned from The Mill in Ulverston, Cumbria, after putting on a sadomasochistic session on the terrace in full display of customers

Lydia added that she had taken a friend from Camden, who identifies as a woman, into the pub because she wanted to be publicly humiliated, The Sun reported.

She said: 'She said she wanted to be publicly humiliated so I was going to take her to a local beauty spot where the walkers go. 

'We thought we would give them something to laugh at. I did that for another customer before the lockdown. 

'But we were running out of time and decided to go for a drink in The Mill. 

'I was going to walk her on a dog lead, but she got embarrassed with everyone looking at us. 

'We signed in and went to the roof terrace, where I chained her to the rafters. 

'I blindfolded her and pretended to walk away and leave her as part of the humiliation. I was videoing it and we didn't think anyone else could see.'

In the video, the sound of the spanking could be heard above the soundtrack of Lovely Day by Bill Withers.

The 'slave' was dressed in black fishnet stocking and suspenders and red knickers, while his mistress wore a black dress as she beat his bottom with a black paddle.    

Lydia, who told The Sun being a dominatrix is 'just a job', said she did not mean to upset The Mill and will 'apologise to them', adding that her family were upset after the video went viral. 

But the owner of The Mill has slammed the couple for their exhibitionism after the X-rated incident and barred them from the pub.

Phil Simpson, owner of The Mill (above), hit out at the couple, who he believes has ties to the Ulverston area, for seeking to 'embarrass small local businesses'

A picture on social media, also shows a message allegedly written by a member of staff after the incident.

It read: 'I sat them upstairs on the terrace, these lads came down that were sat up there ten minutes later telling us to go up and see what's happening - and she has him tied up with a dog lead on one of the beams, whipping him.'

The message also alludes to the fact that the man's genitalia was on display.

Michelle Wood, general manager of The Mill, told The Sun that it was not 'behaviour that we wanted to encourage'.

She said: 'The couple signed in as all customers are asked to do for pandemic regulations and it was obvious that the man was dressed as a woman.

'But in 2020 if you turn men away because they are dressed as women then it is discrimination. 

'One of the other customers started filming what was going on and then came to tell the staff. 

'They just embarrassed us for her financial gain.'

The couple are believed to be part of the BDSM community. BDSM refers to often erotic practices which can involve bondage, dominance or submission.

One witness wrote on Twitter: 'Why is there old blokes getting spanked in suspenders out back of The Mill in Ulverston?'

Shocked customers who witnessed the spanking session shared a video online. The sound of the spanking can be heard above the soundtrack of Lovely Day by Bill Withers

Another Twitter user added: 'Unreal scenes coming from The Mill in Ulverston.'

The woman, a self confessed 'mistress', appeared to share the video of the act on Facebook, but has since been removed from the site.

It is not known whether she had deactivated her account, or if Facebook had suspended the profile.

Phil Simpson, owner of The Mill, believes the couple has ties to the Ulverston area and hit out at them for seeking to 'embarrass small local businesses'.

Mr Simpson added: 'As soon as we spotted this couple's activities they were told to leave our premises.

'They are now barred and having seen their post on social media the police have now contacted us for more information.

'We believe that the woman involved is Ulverston-based and we find it quite depressing that such people should seek to embarrass small local businesses in this manner for financial gain.'
