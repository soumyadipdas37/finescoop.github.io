All Creatures Great and Small heats up tonight as James Herriot strips off to skinny dip. 

The much-loved TV show, which returned to screens on Channel 5 last week, continues tonight and sets up a love triangle between James (Nicholas Ralph), Helen (Rachel Shendon) and a handsome bachelor played by Harry Potter's Matthew Lewis.

James is left red-faced when he is caught by Helen swimming in a local waterfall, splashing around in the water in a moment worthy of romantic hero Mr Darcy.  

Trying to preserve his modesty, James dips down into the water while trying to maintain conversation with his potential love interest.   

All Creatures Great and Small will return to screens for its second episode tonight, with romance heating up between as James decides to go for a skinny dip in a local pond only to be caught by Helen and left red faced in a Poldark-esque moment. They are pictured at a ball later in the episode

Last week viewers loved the season premiere which saw James arrive in the Yorkshire Dales from Glasgow to work as an assistant for the eccentric Siegfried Farnon, played by Mr Selfridge star Samuel West. 

Tonight viewers will be introduced to new characters, including Lewis' character, whose identity has yet to be revealed but appears to have a brooding air. 

James also meets Siegfried's younger brother Tristan, who is returning from University.  

Tristan, played by Callum Woodhouse (The Durrells) takes James to the home of wealthy widow Mrs Pumphrey, who is having trouble with her extremely spoilt pet Tricki Woo, the Pekingnese dog.

The pooch is having stomach problems due to his diet of rich food, including beef wellington, trifle and cake. 

Matthew Lewis (pictured) makes his debut in the show as a handsome bachelor competeting for Rachel Shendon's (Helen) affection. He is pictured on the show

Game of Thrones star Diana Rigg appears in the episode as as a wealthy, wacky widow obsessed with her pooch Tricki Woo

Mrs Pumphrey, played by Dame Diana Rigg who recently wowed critics as Olenna Tyrell in Game of Thrones, is won over by James and quickly refers to him as 'Uncle Herriot'. 

On behalf on Trick Woo, James is then invited to a white tie dance at  Mrs Pumphrey's manor, where he comes across Helen again, as well as Matthew Lewis's Hugh. 

The reboot of the 1980s hit comes amid a huge surge in popularity of shows about rural life, with Our Yorkshire Farm, a Channel 5 show following the real-life dramas of a shepherdess and her nine children, emerging as the surprise hit of the summer. 

The story is based on the real experience of James Herriot (real name Alf Wright) and his semi-autobiographical series of books, which were based on his interactions in North Yorkshire.

James Herriot (Nicholas Ralph, left) a baffled city boy who travelled to the countryside from Glasgow, finds himself in trouble when he gets off the bus too early and has to walk through the night in the pouring rain to get to the veterinary practice, on arrival he's greeted by housekeeper Mrs Hall (Anna Madeley, right)  in the first episode that debuted last week

The collected works of All Creatures Great and Small have sold 60million copies internationally and have never been out of print.

Its most famous adaptation originally ran on the BBC from 1978 to 1990 with Christopher Timothy as the Dales vet and Robert Hardy as his boss, Siegfried Farnon. 

The show is set in the stunning Yorkshire Dales,  and will air after The Yorkshire Vet, a real-life programme about a of Skeldale Veterinary Centre in Thirsk, North Yorkshire - once the practice of Alf Wight.

The Yorkshire Vet is narrated by Christopher Timothy, who played Herriot in the original series of All Creatures Great and Small that aired 30 years ago.
