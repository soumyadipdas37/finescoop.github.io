The Project's Lisa Wilkinson suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction while interviewing Kim Kardashian in 2010.

The journalist, 60, revealed she spoke to the bombshell live on television but didn't noticed her fly was undone until Kim, 39, pointed it out during an ad break.

'With news this week that Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be no more, I thought a few of you might get a giggle out of this throwback interview on the Today Show,' she wrote on Instagram.

'It was the first time I'd interviewed her, and I will be forever grateful that just before we came back from the break Kim pointed out that I might want to do my fly up,' she continued.

'It's also a reminder of how much things have changed for her (and me) over the last decade.'

Lisa previously co-hosted Channel Nine's Today show alongside Karl Stefanovic from 2007 to 2017.

But she made the move to Ten's The Project in 2018, after a reported gender pay gap dispute involving her former co-host.

Meanwhile,Lisa's post comes after Kim announced Keeping Up With The Kardashians has ended after 14 years on Tuesday.

The reality show followed the lives of Kim and her family, including sisters Kendall, Khloe, Kylie and their mother Kris.

Lisa explained: 'It was the first time I'd interviewed her, and I will be forever grateful that just before we came back from the break Kim pointed out that I might want to do my fly up'

During the lengthy post, she said that it was 'time to say goodbye', however she did not cite an official reason for the once hugely-popular reality show to be finishing at the end of its contract next year. 

KUWTK was an instant hit in America and only rose in popularity as viewers tuned in to keep up with the family drama, with 4.8 million tuning into the season four finale at its peak.

However it is no secret that viewership has dropped in recent years and less than 900,000 live viewers on average tuned into the 18th and most recent series of the programme.
