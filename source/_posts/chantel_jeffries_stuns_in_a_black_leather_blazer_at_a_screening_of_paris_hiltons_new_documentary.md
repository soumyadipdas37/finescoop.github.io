She returned to Los Angeles days earlier after spending time with her boyfriend Andrew Taggart in Mexico's Cabo San Lucas.

And Chantel Jeffries marked her return stateside by attending a friends and family screening of her pal Paris Hilton's new documentary This Is Paris.

The 27-year-old DJ rocked an edgy leather look at the outdoor screening, which was decorated with some of the host's iconic catchphrases from her days on The Simple Life.

Chantel looked too cool for school in her black leather blazer, which she wore little under aside from a black bandeau bra that was tied together over her bust.

She paired the top with high-waisted weather black jeans that hugged her slender legs, and she added some flair with pointy patent leather boots.

The dark-haired beauty wore her brunette locks in a high ponytail with isolated strands framing her impeccably made-up face.

She also toted around a black handbag slung over one shoulder.

Chantel was a stark contrast with Paris, who wore a vibrant rainbow-colored tie-dye skirt and shirt combo.

The two shared a sweet hug before the movie, and the musician got a close look at Paris' adorable gray and black fluffball.

Although Chantel has been photographed before wearing masks in public due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, she opted not to wear a mask at the screening, as did most other guests.

However, white couches were arranged on the lawn for socially distanced pods of guests.

Shocking revelations: The new YouTube documentary This Is Paris features shocking revelations about the heiress' adolescence, including a stint in an allegedly abusive boarding school

The new YouTube documentary This Is Paris features shocking revelations about the heiress' adolescence, including a stint in an allegedly abusive boarding school in which she was fed tranquilizers, verbally abused and endured 10-hour stretches in solitary confinement.

The film also generated buzz because Paris drops much of her recognizable vocal fry, unveiling a smoother, deeper voice that she claims is how she talks when she's not performing for the camera.

Sitting out the screening was Chantel's boyfriend Drew Taggart, one-half of the popular electronic music duo The Chainsmokers.

Chantel, who was previously linked to Machine Gun Kelly, Justin Bieber and Diplo, was first linked with Drew in February.

She showed the relationship was heating up late in July with an Instagram photo shared with her 4.7 million followers of the two kissing while dining outdoors.

She shared the post the same day that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lambasted Drew's group The Chainsmokers for 'egregious social distancing violations' after the performed in front of a packed crowd with few mask wearers at a Safe & Sound charity event in New York's Southampton.

The pandemic doesn't seem to have put any constraints on the Chantel and Drew, as they've taken trips to both Maine and Mexico in recent weeks.
