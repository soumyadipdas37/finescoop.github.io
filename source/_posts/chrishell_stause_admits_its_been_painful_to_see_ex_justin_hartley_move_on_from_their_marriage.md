'I feel like anybody would be heartbroken to see how quickly or easily you are replaced; of course that's going to sting,' Stause told People.

However, after a bout of therapy and the passage of time, Stause says she's currently 'very happy'. 

'I'm in such a great place and I'm so grateful for everything, she said. 'I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.'  

 Traded in: 'I feel like anybody would be heartbroken to see how quickly or easily you are replaced; of course that's going to sting,' Stause, 39, told People about 43-year-old Hartley's new romance with his former The Young and the Restless co-star Sofia Pernas, 31

In the interview, Stause revealed she has 'taken the steps to freeze my eggs,' adding that she hopes having a family 'is still a possibility for me.'

Chrishell opting to freeze her eggs comes just weeks after the end of her divorce was played out on the cameras on her hit Netflix show Selling Sunset.

The beauty was blindsided by husband Justin Hartley when he filed for divorce  in November 2019 after two years of marriage and then told her via text message.

The gorgeous star said that she wanted to take the pressure off of herself as well as her future partner about starting a family: 'I'm going to do everything I can to take that power in the situation, and hopefully, that will empower me going forward in the dating world, so there's not so much pressure.' 

'I definitely had a different idea for where I would be at this age and stage in my life. There's a family aspect that I'm missing that I hope is still a possibility for me,' she told the outlet.

Chrishell said: 'Everything happens for a reason. I'm grateful for the twists and the turns, as painful as they've been.' 

She said that she was preparing to freeze her eggs when she was approached by DWTS.

Explaining that: 'I was in the middle of the process when DWTS approached me. So for the first weeks of rehearsal, I was giving myself daily hormone shots while learning the tango, and procedure was done a few days before the premiere of the show.'

She jokingly added: 'Maybe I could blame that on my less than stellar tango! Just kidding - I will always suck at the tango.' 

This Monday, Chrishell and her DWTS pro partner Gleb Savchenko danced as Cinderella and Prince Charming for the show's annual Disney night. 

On August 7, season three of Selling Sunset premiered on the streaming giant Netflix. 

During the season, Chrishell learned her husband Justin Hartley filed for divorce on season three of the drama series, and cameras were on hand to capture the emotional aftermath.

Strength: Chrishell says she was blindsided by Justin's decision to end their marriage, and claimed he broke the divorce news to her over text message

Chrishell says she was blindsided by Justin's decision to end their marriage, and claimed he broke the divorce news to her over text message.

Just 45 minutes later, their split appeared on entertainment sites.

'He text me that we were filed,' she said, adding: 'Forty-five minutes later, the world knew.'

Though he filed for divorce almost a year ago, the drama has continued to play out.

She was seen moving her things into a new bachelorette home with her pup by side after the shocking split. 

Her voice: Hartley is said to be 'irritated that she's airing their private information publicly and knows there is more to the story than is being told,' a source told Us Weekly 

Apparently, the This Is Us actor is not happy with how Chrishell has been portraying their breakup.

Hartley is said to be 'irritated that she's airing their private information publicly and knows there is more to the story than is being told,' a source told Us Weekly.

While Justin has reportedly not watched the episodes, he has been told what Chrishell has been saying about their split.  

Justin and Chrishell met on their show soap opera Days Of Our Lives and began dating in 2013; He proposed in 2016 and they wed in October 2017 at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu in front of 75 friends and family.

Justin, who currently stars on This Is Us, has a daughter Isabella, 16, from his previous marriage to Lindsay Korman.

In November 2019, Justin filed for divorce and listed it due to irreconcilable differences, listing their separation date as July 8, 2019 - despite attending several events together - even the week before he filed, TMZ reported.

He requested that she pay her own lawyer fees and that he does not pay Chrishell spousal support. 

In December, a source told People that the duo did have 'some problems, but she certainly never thought he would just go and suddenly file for divorce, and not even try to save things.'

Adding: 'He's reached a new level of fame thanks to [This Is Us] and he doesn't want to close many doors right now, and that's not necessarily the path Chrishell is looking to take. She thought babies would happen soon after they got married, but it just hasn't worked out.' 

The insider for the outlet noted that 'Justin has already been married and divorced once before. But Chrishell had been in other serious relationships in the past ... and didn't take them further because she was always adamant that when she got married, it would be forever — she was only going to do this once.'

They dated for three years before marrying because of this: 'It's partly why she and Justin waited so long to get married: she wanted to be sure that when they said their vows, they meant them. And she did — she would have stayed forever.'

Six months after he filed for divorce, Justin, 43, was seen locking lips with his former The Young and The Restless co-star Sofia Pernas, 30. 

In July 2020, Chrishell filed to have her maiden name of Stause restored legally and Hartley removed from her legal name, according to The Blast.
