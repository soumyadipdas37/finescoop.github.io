They have confirmed their comeback album Confetti will be released on November 6. 

And Perrie Edwards delighted fans on Thursday as she showed off her incredible figure in a white thong and crop top. 

The Little Mix singer, 27, showed off her toned abs in the cropped T-shirt which had ruched detailing as she playfully stuck out her tongue for the camera.

Perrie, who has worked hard on her fitness throughout lockdown, looked tanned and toned as she posed up a storm in the high rise thong. 

She wore her blonde hair in crimped waves, tied back in a ponytail and amped up the glamour with a pink palette of make-up. 

Fans took to the comment section pondering if the snap was a teaser for the band's next single.

Perrie's sexy photo comes as reports emerged Little Mix have made a staggering £28.5million since winning The X Factor back in 2011. 

The band -Perrie, Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson- made a £938,827 profit last year, despite not releasing a record, The Sun reports. 

In the latest accounts from their firm Eternal Dance, the near £1million boost brings the net worth of their company to £4,870,417.

The healthy sum comes as the band have just released their new album Confetti, which should add to their growing money pot.  

And with the launch of their BBC show Little Mix: The Search in the hunt to find the perfect band to tour with them, the quartets' finances should be on the up. 

Back in July it was reported that Jesy, Jade and Perrie banked a whopping £700,000 in the past year, after the millions they raked in for their tour.  

The girls- minus Leigh-Anne- all set up private companies registered in their first and second names. 

The Sun reports Companies House show Jade, 27, was the top earner, with her firm banking £312,959 in accounts dated 31 March 2020.

Meanwhile, Perrie, made a profit of £179,508 after deductions were made for bills of her £239,945 she banked for her company Perrie Louise.
