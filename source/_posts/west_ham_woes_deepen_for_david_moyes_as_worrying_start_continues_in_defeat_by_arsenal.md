You know you’ve had a bad day when Patrice Evra suggesting Manchester United ditched Wilfried Zaha because of an ‘affair’ with your daughter is only the second worst thing to happen.

Several hours after Evra brought up that unfounded rumour live on Sky Sports, David Moyes suffered his second defeat of the season, and the manner of it was crushing for the Scot.

Arsenal did not play well, West Ham did, and yet they still lost. With luck like this, you wonder where their next points will come from, given their frightening fixture list.



Wolves, Leicester, Tottenham, Manchester City then Liverpool – all before November.

West Ham arrived here with a game plan to stop Arsenal from scoring and go on the counter.

It worked for a while. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang did not manage his first touch of the ball until 13 minutes and 48 seconds had passed. After 15 minutes, Arsenal had not managed a single shot on or off target. After 20, still nothing.

But then, with one through-ball by Bukayo Saka, Moyes’ game plan was thwarted. Aubameyang was set free and his hanging cross found the head of Alexandre Lacazette for 1-0.

Moyes, to his credit, called on his players to stick to his set-up. His side continued to frustrate Arsenal’s forwards and chances were created by the visitors on the counter-attack.

They got back into it through Michail Antonio, but could and should have had two or three more.

There was the penalty that VAR failed to award for a handball by Gabriel on the day Crystal Palace won one for something very similar by Manchester United’s Victor Lindelof.

Then there was the shot from Antonio, two yards out, which was smothered by Bernd Leno. Then Antonio directed a header on to the crossbar.

But Moyes’ luck was out. Arsenal scored instead, and it’s another loss for West Ham.
