Gordon Ramsay has split opinion after sharing a video of his chocolate tofu pudding, which has been branded 'perhaps the most unappetising and unappealing dessert ever'.

The TV chef, 53, posted a Facebook video of the £10 pudding, which is the signature dessert of his swanky Mayfair restaurant Lucky Cat, which specialises in Asian cuisine. 

The post quickly racked up 25,000 likes and 4,700 comments, with some saying they'd like to taste the dish, but others were left baffled by what looked like a 'brown paper bag' placed on top. 

Another very impressed user penned: 'First the poop in the middle, then covered by a layer of what looks like fat, and topped with a piece of pork crackling.'

While many thought the pudding looks 'amazing', others were baffled about the 'brown paper bag' on top of the dish 

Alongside the video, the chef penned: 'The signature chocolate tofu at Lucky Cat by Gordon Ramsay.... absolutely beautiful!!'

And users agreed that the dish looked 'amazing', writing: 'beautifully presented. That's made me hungry!' 

'Looks AMAZING', another agreed.  

While another decided: 'Not really a looker but I'm sure it tastes amazing'. 









Some users weren't so kind about the dish, with many confused about the brown sheet added to the pudding at the end, joking the 'brown paper bag totally ruined it'





Some users thought the dish looked 'amazing', writing: 'beautifully presented. That's made me hungry!'

However others weren't so kind about the dish, with many confused about the brown sheet added to the pudding at the end, joking the 'brown paper bag totally ruined it'. 

'Looked great until he put that brown paper on it. Totally ruined it', one wrote. 

'He covered the beautiful part! I'm sure it tastes delicious but the white stuff and the brown sheet do not look appetizing,' said another.

One vivid user compared the dessert to being 'covered by a layer of what looks like fat, and topped with a piece of pork crackling'

Meanwhile some users were dubious about the idea of putting chocolate with tofu all together, with one saying: 'Chocolate and tofu should not be used in the same sentence.'

'Love you Gordon but chocolate and tofu? I would rather eat the chocolate cake thank you', commented another. 

A third agreed: 'Sorry, but chocolate and tofu should NEVER be used together in any way, shape or form whether physically or verbally.'

Last week diners slammed the chef's £20 preselected cheese board served at his restaurant in Chelsea, branding it 'insulting' and 'bland.'

The latest negative review was the fourth time this month that the celebrity TV chef food had been slammed. 

Weeks ago, he was criticised online when he shared a photograph of his Sunday lunch on Instagram. 

While Gordon labelled the 'sirloin of beef with all the trimmings' 'absolutely stunning', several of his 9.8million followers were left unimpressed by the three baby carrots and roast potatoes offered - with one person asking: 'Where's the rest of it?

He also came under fire with both his £19 Full English Breakfast at the Savoy Grill and the 'tiny' £23 steak and over-salted chips at his York & Albany eatery in Camden, being criticised.
