Just days after getting evicted from Big Brother All-Stars, Janelle Pierzina put one of her former houseguests Nicole Franzel on blast.

Pierzina, 41, who has competed on four seasons of Big Brother, was evicted from the Big Brother house last Thursday, and in a goodbye message, the 28-year-old Franzel essentially uninvited Pierzina to the wedding.

Upon returning to her home in Minnesota, Pierzina received Franzel's wedding invitation, which showcased on Twitter and blasted Franzel for charging a whopping $3K just for the hotel stay at her wedding.

'Just received my invite. 3k for hotel so Nicole’s reception and hotel stay can basically be comped,' Pierzina began.

'Glad I don’t have to go. I hate cheap a** weddings where the go to song is Cotton Eyed Joe,' she concluded.

During her goodbye message, Franzel's relationship with Pierzina had clearly strained during their time in the Big Brother house.

'I thought we were really good friends outside of here and quickly I realized that wasn’t the case. I know you probably don’t want to come to my wedding, so just don’t worry about it,' Nicole said in her goodbye message.

Franzel has not yet responded to Pierzina's tweet, where she showcased Franzel's invite, that was designed like a passport, along with the RSVP card.

Franzel is tying the knot with Victor Arroyo, who was a houseguest with her on Big Brother 18, which Franzel won.

Dani also explained that, 'Charging 3K to attend the wedding is a tacky way of getting your guests to foot the bill.

She added in another tweet that the 3K is just for a 'three night stay' and 'airfare is extra.'

The tweet also got the attention of Bachelor Nation star Demi Burnett, who said, 'I'm Screaming who pays 3k to go to a wedding... wait I would pay 3k to go to your wedding Janie.'

Franzel was eliminated by a vote of 9-2 on last Thursday's episode of Big Brother, with Dani Briones and Enzo Palumbo throwing 'hinky' votes for Janelle just to stir things up in the house.

Franzel threw some shade Dani's way as well, in an interview with US Weekly after her eviction.

'I absolutely did want to work with Danielle initially. But she was so cemented in that alliance and I have Kaysar that I have to protect, so it was like, ‘How is this going to work out?" Janelle began.

'She’s with the people that would target me and Kaysar. But if things were different and I didn’t have Kaysar, I would absolutely try to get in that alliance, obviously, day one,' she added.

Janelle then raised eyebrows by insinuating that she would 'let' Dani win the game after her eviction.

'I thought about throwing Danielle and Nicole Franzel's game out the window, and blowing up my relationship with Danielle outside of the house. But I figured, I’m not going to do that. Let Danielle win,' she said.

'If Danielle wins the game, I’d feel extremely happy for her. Career-wise, she doesn’t have a lot going on and she probably really needs the money. So I was like, "I’m not going to do that to Dani"' she added.

Big Brother All-Stars returns Wednesday night at 8 PM ET on CBS.
