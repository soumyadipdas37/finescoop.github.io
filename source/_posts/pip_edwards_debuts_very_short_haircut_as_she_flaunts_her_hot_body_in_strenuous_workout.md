Pip Edwards has decided to revamp her look with a fresh new haircut. 

The 40-year-old has swapped her shoulder length lob for a much shorter 'do. 

On Tuesday, the P.E Nation designer debuted her new hairstyle on Instagram as she flaunted her fit physique in tight activewear during a Pilates class.

In the image, Pip stood on tip toes in a pair of orange exercise leggings and a black crop top from her own line, which revealed her super toned torso. 

The mother-of-one was smiling as she tipped her head to the side. 

The blonde, who is current'y dating former cricket captain Michael Clarke, captioned the post: 'Happy'.

Pip also shared a series of images of her strenuous fluidform Pilates workout to her Instagram Story. 

In one image, Pip was balancing on her forearms and her feet were in straps on a reformer machine.  

Another image showed Pip hanging upside down with both feet in the air while she gripped the bar above her.

Last week Pip also turned heads by wearing a pair of nude-coloured leggings that made her appear naked at first glance.

Instagram fans did a double take as she uploaded a photo of herself modelling the optical illusion tights inside her Pilates studio.

Posing next to a reformer machine, a pouty-looking Pip wrote in the caption: 'Hands down my most favourite place to be ... the Pilates studio.'
