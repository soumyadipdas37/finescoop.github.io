Julia Garner disappeared into the role of fake German heiress Anna Delvey while filming in New York this Tuesday.

Julia's black and white houndstooth jacket featured flecks of red, forming the perfect complement to her gleaming crimson purse.

Wearing her blonde hair down, she accented the look with makeup and a black choker and slipped into black hose.

Between takes Julia and the rest of the cast and crew made sure to take the precaution of wearing masks.

Julia and a couple of her male cast members were also glimpsed wearing transparent face shields for extra protection.

However she did have to take her face covering off at one point in order to have her makeup touched up by a masked crew member.

The show covers the real life of Anna Sorokina, who was born outside Moscow but pretended to be a German heiress while in America.

Last year she was sentenced to four to 12 years behind bars for scamming hotels, banks and a private jet firm out of almost $200,000, as well for attempting to bilk a $25 million loan from a hedge fund.

She ingratiated herself into New York City's beau monde under her fake heiress identity Anna Delvey until she eventually got caught in 2017.

The 'Soho Grifter' was arrested that year and held in Rikers Island, precipitating a trial where the fashionista wowed the press with her glamorous courtroom looks.

After a month at trial she was convicted of three counts of grand larceny, one of attempted grand larceny and four counts of theft of services.

'I'd be lying to you and to everyone else and to myself if I said I was sorry for anything,' she told the New York Times last year after her sentencing.
