She is reportedly in a 'serious relationship' with The Daily Show host Trevor Noah.

But Minka Kelly enjoyed some time to herself in New York City on Friday.

The 40-year-old actress was spotted riding around the Big Apple in her edgy, Super73 electric bike.

Minka held on tight to the handlebars as she made her way off the sidewalk and onto the street.

The actress had a relaxed air to her as she biked through the concrete jungle while occasionally glancing about to admire the city scenery.

The star was better dressed for a low-key walk than a bike ride, with her button down white blouse and flowing blue-green trousers.

She did wear her hair up into a bun, but was not wearing a face mask or helmet.

The outing comes amid reports Minka is in a 'very serious' relationship with Trevor Noah.

An insider told People Monday that the TV host and actress are 'very happy' with one another. 

The couple were seen arriving at Trevor's New York City apartment earlier this week, along with Minka's dog in tow.

Minka and Trevor have yet to comment on reports indicating they have started dating.

Minka has past been in high-profile romances with actors Chris Evans, Wilmer Valderrama, Jesse Williams and baseball icon Derek Jeter.

Trevor's most recent romance came with model Jordyn Taylor in 2017, and he was linked to South African physiotherapist Dani Gabriel prior to that.
