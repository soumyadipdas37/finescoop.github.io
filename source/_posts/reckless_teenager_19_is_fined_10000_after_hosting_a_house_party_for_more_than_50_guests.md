A 'reckless' teenager has been fined £10,000 after hosting a house party for more than 50 guests.

The 19-year-old was 'hostile' when council community protection officers turned up at the event in Lenton, Nottingham, which is close to the university.

Police were called a short time later and found around 50 people at the address who were all ordered to leave.

Officers claim the teenager was given the chance to shut down Friday's party before he was issued with the fine.

Assistant chief constable Steve Cooper from Nottinghamshire Police said: 'We need to all remember we are very much still in the middle of a global pandemic and we all need to take responsibility for our actions.

'This party was a clear example of a householder who deliberately flouted the rules without a care for anyone else and as a result we have used the full powers we have to deal with this.

'Under current rules we can issue fines to anyone hosting gatherings of more than 30 people which can result in fines of up to £10,000.

'And now we are on the eve of rules becoming even tighter so there can be gatherings of no more than six.'

Neighbours reported the house party to Nottinghamshire Police at around 10.20pm on Friday.

Amy English, council neighbourhood policing inspector for City Central, added: 'Residents have had fair warning that we won't tolerate people flouting the laws and regulations around the Coronavirus restrictions must be adhered to by everyone.

'In this case the resident also had the chance to shut the party down when they were first visited by our council colleagues.'
