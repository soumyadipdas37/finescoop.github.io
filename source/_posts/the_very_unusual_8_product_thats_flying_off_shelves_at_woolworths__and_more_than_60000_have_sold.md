Customers across Australia are rushing to get their hands on a new unique spring garden ornament from Woolworths.

In August the supermarket giant released meerkat statues priced at $8 each and Woolworths Australia CEO Brad Banducci told FEMAIL more than 60,000 have already sold.

It's believed customers are paying more attention to how they can change their living rooms and outdoor spaces as more people are spending time at home.

Customers can choose between 18 different statues including meerkat princess, fireman, bride, soldier, witch and hero, as the meerkats are wearing outfits.

A Woolworths spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'With the arrival of spring, we know customers are eager to spend more time in their yard and gardens and are looking for new ways to spruce up their homes.

'The meerkat statues have been exceptionally popular with our customers and most of our stock has nearly sold out.'

Gardening and floral categories have grown almost 40 per cent more at Woolworths and almost 20 per cent more at BIG W compared to last year.

Woolworths also sold the unusual garden ornaments last year, but this year the number of sales have doubled and the product has been in demand.

The supermarket sold the equivalent of last year's stock in the first week of this year's collection.

New limited-edition Halloween meerkats will also be released on October 2.
