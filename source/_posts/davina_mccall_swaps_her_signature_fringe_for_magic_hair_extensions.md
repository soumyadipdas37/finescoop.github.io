She's been back to business in recent weeks and recently co-hosted Boots' Christmas Unwrapped show.

And Davina McCall switched things up amid the coronavirus pandemic as she underwent a dramatic hair transformation on Friday.

The broadcaster, 52, ditched her signature fringe for 'magic' extensions in a behind-the-scenes image from what appeared to be a photoshoot.

What a change! Davina McCall switched things up amid the coronavirus pandemic as she underwent a dramatic hair transformation on Friday (R on Thursday)

Presenter Davina, who usually sports a shoulder-length 'do, opted for a different look with locks which skimmed her upper torso.

The former model was experimental in the beauty department too, with the brunette accentuating her features with silver-toned eyeshadow. 

The Wimbledon native cut a casual figure in a dark jacket and a black vest to ensure focus remained on her new look.

Davina recently insisted she isn't 'pert and tight' like she was in her 20s despite her gym-honed physique.

The media personality, who is known for updating her social media followers on her fitness journey, told the Women's Health Going for Goal podcast she's embraced her 'sagging' skin and feels like she is 'the best version' she could be for her age. 

Davina also discussed the brazen methods she used to educate her three children about the changes of puberty as she wanted them to realise that the topic isn't 'disgusting.' 

She said: 'I'm not all pert and tight like I was when I was 20. If I lean over…my skin sags down at the middle, the front, but I feel like I am the best version that I can be for my age, and that gives me confidence. 

'You can wear your body well if you've got confidence.'  

On how she's prepared her three children Holly, 18, Tilly, 16, and Chester, 13, about the changes that come with puberty, the TV star admitted she was incredibly open, even if it meant sacrificing certain parts of her beauty regime.

She added: 'Even down to waxing my privates, when they were going through puberty and, therefore, their bodies were changing, I kept everything there bar, like, a bikini wax, just to show them what they had was normal, because mummy's got it too.

'Obviously now they can do what they like, they're 16 and 18 , but when they were little - 12, 13, 14 - I didn't want them thinking they were disgusting because they had pubes.'
