The younger man (pictured), believed to be aged in his 20s, turned and struck the older man in the back of the head before fleeing

A manhunt is underway for a thug who coward-punched a stranger in the back of the head because he accidentally bumped into him on a footpath. 

The unprovoked assault happened on September 18 in Glebe, in Sydey's inner west, and left the 60-year-old man with a fractured skull.

The victim had been walking north along Bay Street when he was hit in the stomach by a hooded man walking past him.

The younger man, believed to be aged in his 20s, then turned and struck the older man in the back of the head before fleeing. 

The man's skull cracked on the pavement outside Broadway Shopping Centre where he was left unconscious.  

'It was as bad as it gets when you see a king hit on CCTV footage,' Leichhardt Police Detective Acting Inspector Michael Egan-Hirst told The Daily Telegraph. 

'The victim himself says he doesn't feel the same.'

Insp Egan Hirst urged the alleged attacker to turn himself into police

Insp Egan Hirst urged the alleged attacker to turn himself into police.

'Hand yourself in otherwise we're going to come for you,' he warned.

The injured man was treated at the scene by NSW Ambulance paramedics before being taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with serious head injuries.

He underwent surgery and has since been released from hospital, but there are fears he may suffer permanent brain damage.

As inquiries continue, investigators have released CCTV images of a man they believe may be able to assist them with their inquiries.

He is described as having an olive complexion, aged in his 20s, with a slim build and a short dark beard, and was seen wearing a black hooded jumper and black Adidas tracksuit pants.

Insp Egan Hirst said the coward punch was sparked by nothing more than a harmless bump that would happen between anyone walking on the street.

The alleged perpetrator is facing a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent if arrested.
