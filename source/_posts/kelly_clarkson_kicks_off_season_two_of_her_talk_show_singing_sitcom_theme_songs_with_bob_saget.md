Daytime Emmy Award-winning host Kelly Clarkson kicked off season two of her talk show on Monday by singing a feel-good medley of sitcom theme songs alongside Full House alum Bob Saget.

For the first time in six months, the 38-year-old Texan pop powerhouse was back in her studio alongside her band and crew as she took on popular jingles from Full House, Cheers, and The Golden Girls.

Kelly addressed the 64-year-old comedian directly as his sitcom dad character Danny Tanner and he consoled her about the age of social distancing and COVID-19 while clad in a white suit.

'One thing you should always remember is you are never alone,' Bob told Clarkson as Danny. 'You have so many people who love and care about you, including me.'

Saget then joined the original American Idol champ - and her three-octave soprano pipes - on her popular 'Kellyoke' segment by belting the theme song from The Mary Tyler Moore Show.

Among the virtual audience members were Ed Asner from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, George Wendt and John Ratzenberger from Cheers, and Dave Coulier and Jodie Sweetin from Full House.

'Let's just get this out of the way. 2020 has been a dumpster fire. Yup just all the words that I can't say on this show just piled together and it's on fire. That's really what it's felt like,' Kelly later explained.

'I wanted to sing those classic TV songs, because in hard times when we're separated, it's the nostalgic moments with family and friends that hold us together.'

Clarkson then addressed how she legally separated from her manager-turned-husband Brandon Blackstock on June 4 after seven years of marriage saying cryptically: 'Definitely didn't see anything coming that came.'

'What I'm dealing with is hard because it involves more than just my heart. It involves a lot of little hearts. We have four kids,' the three-time Grammy winner explained.

'Divorce is never easy. We're both from divorced families so we know the best thing is to protect our children and their little hearts. So, I'm usually very open and I ususally talk about everything. But in this case, I will talk a little bit here and there about how it affects me personally.

'My kids come first': After nearly seven years of marriage, the three-time Grammy winner is now requesting joint legal and physical custody of her son Remington, 4; and daughter River, 6; with the 43-year-old former stepson of Reba McEntire (pictured in 2018) 

'But I probably won't go too far into it, because I'm a mama bear and my kids come first. Although, I do love you all. But I am okay. Everybody keeps asking and I am. The answer is yes.'

After nearly seven years of marriage, Kelly is now requesting joint legal and physical custody of her son Remington, 4; and daughter River, 6; with the 43-year-old former stepson of Reba McEntire.

Brandon also fathered two older children - daughter Savannah, 18; and son Seth, 13 - from his first marriage to Melissa Ashworth.

And if that wasn't enough, the I Dare You songstress resumes coaching duties on the 19th season of The Voice, which premieres October 19 on NBC.

'I'm a good amount of busy. I know it looks like a lot on paper. I've kind of always had a lot of jobs,' Kelly told Sunday TODAY last week.
