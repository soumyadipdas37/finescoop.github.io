Just days after the Kardashian family announced that their long-running reality series Keeping Up With the Kardashians is coming to an end, Scott Disick was spotted out.

The 37-year-old reality star was spotted leaving the office of Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner on Tuesday afternoon.

His outing also comes on the heels of a Page Six report that both Disick and Khloe Kardashian were against the show going off the air because they both wanted to keep getting an 'easy payday.'

Disick was spotted wearing a multi-colored, partially-unbuttoned button-down shirt and light blue jeans.

He also wore a pair of brown sunglasses with a small necklace dangling from his neck as he left the office in Calabasas.

The reality star and house-flipper completed his casual look with a pair of light blue jeans and multi-colored Nike sneakers, plus a gold watch.

Kardashian fans were quite shocked when the family announced they were ending Keeping Up With the Kardashians after its 20th season, which recently started filming and will debut on E! in 2021.

Sources told Page Six that the family was 'divided' into two camps about whether or not to continue the show, with just Disick and Khloe Kardashian opting to continue. 

Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner were in favor of ending the show, after they reportedly realized it wasn't the best 'money-making strategy.'

The sources added that both Khloe and Disick saw the show as an, 'easy and reliable payday,' though there is no indication on where Disick's ex Kourtney, or her brother Rob felt about continuing the show.

'Some of them needed the money more than others,' a source added, though both Disick and Khloe have rumored net worth of $40 million, so neither are exactly hurting for money. 

Still, even the family members who were in favor of ending the show would have likely continued, had there not been a COVID-19 pandemic.

'If it wasn’t for the pandemic, it could have kept going,' the source said. 'But times are changing, and budgets are lower, and people want to move on.'

Disick has appeared on the show since the first season in 2007, when he was dating Kourtney Kardashian, and he's been a fixture ever since.

He also starred in his own E! spin-off Flip It Like Disick which focuses on his house-flipping business, which debuted last year on E!, though it hasn't been renewed for a second season quite yet.
