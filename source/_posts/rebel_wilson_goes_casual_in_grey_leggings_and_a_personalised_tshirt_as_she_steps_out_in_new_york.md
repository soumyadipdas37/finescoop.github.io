According to People magazine, Rebel's remarkable transformation is partially down to following the Mayr Method diet plan.

'It's an approach that eliminates food intolerances, reduces sugar, encourages eating whole foods slowly, boosts the immune system and reduces inflammation,' a source said.

'She exercises with a personal trainer up to six times a week, goes on walks and is trying to up her protein intake nutritionally.'

Meanwhile her personal trainer Jono recently shared her workout routine with E! Australia.

During a typical week, Rebel does a combination of HIIT workouts, mobility, weights and resistance, and has just one day per week of rest.
