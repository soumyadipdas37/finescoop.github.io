She has been trailing a blaze for Milan Fashion Week. 

And Olivia Palermo caught the eye as she arrived for Philosophy's outdoor show on Saturday afternoon.

The City star, 34, looked every inch the fashionista in a cream PVC jacket which she teamed with a matching midi skirt.

Olivia shrugged the double breasted coat over her shoulders and wore a simple blacs jumper underneath.

The oversized skirt sheathed her slender frame and teased a hint of her toned legs as it cut just below the knee. 

Olivia teamed her monochrome outfit with biker boots and a black and white clutch bag.

Standing out from the crowd: Milan is only one of the four fashion capitals that is hosting the catwalk showcases with a few adjustments in light of the coronavirus pandemic

Milan is only one of the four fashion capitals that is hosting the catwalk showcases with a few adjustments in light of the coronavirus pandemic. 

The city are hosting 23 shows- a move which sets them apart from New York and London, who have both held virtual fashion weeks. 

Paris has 20 scheduled shows planned next week but coveted guestlists have been reduced dramatically, in keeping with strict socially distancing guidelines.  

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus. 

Back in February, Georgia Armani cancelled his show in Milan as the virus began to sweep through the country.
