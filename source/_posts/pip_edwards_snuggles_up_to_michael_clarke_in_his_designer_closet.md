They have been dating for months after meeting and falling for each other following his split from ex-wife, Kyly.

And Michael Clarke and Pip Edwards continue to flaunt their romance all over social media.

P.E Nation designer Pip, 40, posted a picture of the pair snuggling up in his designer closet at his Bondi Beach pad on Thursday evening.

They're smitten! Pip Edwards snuggled up to former Australian Cricket Captain Michael Clarke in his designer closet this week as she continues to spend more time at his mansion

In the picture, former Australian cricket captain Michael, 39, was seen wrapping his arm around the business mogul's neck and tenderly caressing her arm. 

Pip was barefoot in his impressive closet, wearing a pair of baggy casual black trousers and a white tank top. 

Meanwhile, Michael was sporty in black shorts, an olive green T-shirt and some Off White Nike sneakers. 

Pip appears to be spending more and more time at Michael's home, as evident from her Instagram selfies.  

Earlier this month, in a rare interview for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine, Michael reflected on his life, a year after separating from wife of seven years, Kyly Clarke.

While he preferred to keep coy about his new romance with Pip, the retired Australian cricketer did reveal that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'.

'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said.

Hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip the radio host did say that he couldn't be happier.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said.

Michael went on to add that if negative attention is directed at his daughter or partner, it always hits him 'much harder' than if it were something 'thrown' at him.

The sporting great had separated from Kyly, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.

It is understood there was no third party involved in their shock split.

The Clarkes have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their daughter Kelsey Lee.

Reports surfaced Michael had begun dating Pip after his separation with Kyly became public knowledge.

Pip seemingly confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, and the pair enjoyed a PDA-filled trip to Noosa, Queensland that same month.
