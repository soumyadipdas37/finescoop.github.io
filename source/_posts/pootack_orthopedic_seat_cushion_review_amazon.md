With the majority of us working from home during the coronavirus lockdown, chances are that you've been sitting at your dining room table or makeshift desk in an uncomfortable chair that doesn't provide the best support for your back.

Enter the Pootack Orthopedic Seat Cushion, now £19.26 (29 per cent off), which Amazon shoppers swear by for creating a comfortable home office.

Thanks to its memory foam design, the cushion contours to the body's pressure points to help alleviate pain and provide the best comfort and support.

Hundreds of shoppers have awarded the ergonomic cushion a perfect five-star rating, and the majority also left praise-filled reviews. 

Users rave about the immediate support and pain relief the Pootack Orthopedic Seat Cushion provides saying it's ideal for work, home, travelling and even for use in restaurants.

'Fantastic product, very comfortable,' one shopper wrote. 'It takes some getting used to if you are used to hard or very soft surfaces to sit on. 

'This helps not only with my posture but lower back pain. It lives in my car, and I take it everywhere I go. Even to restaurants!!'

'Just what I needed,' another shopper added. 'As a long term sufferer of chronic pain, particularly in hips and back, this cushion has been perfect for use on my computer chair.

'No longer am I constantly fidgeting in my seat and having to get up at least every half hour. Comfortable, good size, supportive, and fits the seat well.'

The brand also claims the cushion helps those with 'lower back pain, numbness and pain from sciatica, herniated discs, tailbone injuries, back pain from pregnancy, hip pain, hemorrhoids, and pressure sores'

Not only is it a hit with those working from home, but the brand also claims their Orthopedic Seat Cushion helps those with 'lower back pain, numbness and pain from sciatica, herniated discs, tailbone injuries, back pain from pregnancy, hip pain, hemorrhoids, and pressure sores'.

And it's a favourite among mums-to-be too. As one customer wrote in their five-star review: 'Has helped so much with tailbone pain I've been experiencing in pregnancy. Would recommend to anyone with back/other pains. Makes sitting in the same chair for an eight-hour day infinitely more comfortable.'

The cushion comes with a cover that's removable when it needs a wash, and features a non-slip rubber bottom to help it stay in place.
