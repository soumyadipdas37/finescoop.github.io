If your normal gym attire is always black, then why not take a leaf out for Georgia Fowler's book and opt for a colourful pair of shorts.

The model stepped out in Bryon Bay wearing a black crop top, orange Nike shorts and black trainers. Naturally, her high-waisted figure-hugging shorts instantly caught our attention thanks to the two-tone orange colourway before we noticed the black logo detailing.

They hail from Nike's 'Pro Hypercool' collection and made from stretch fabric for a second-skin feel. Sadly, they have now sold out but with our roundup below you can easily get the look.
