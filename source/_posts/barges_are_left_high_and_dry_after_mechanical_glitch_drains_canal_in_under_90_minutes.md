A row of canal and river boats were left sitting high and dry after a bizarre mechanical fault which left a canal DRAINED of water.

Boats were left stuck in the mud, or tipped partially on their side in the remaining trickle of water, after the canal level dropped dramatically by almost two metres in just an hour and a half.

Bemused passengers were left sitting atop their stranded canal narrowboats, waiting for emergency services to come and rescue them from the muddy bog that was left behind.
