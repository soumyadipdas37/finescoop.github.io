She recently vowed to embrace her 'lumps and bumps' as a result of welcoming her baby girl. 

And Cher Lloyd put her incredible figure on display as she shared a sultry selfie with her Instagram followers on Monday. 

Clad in a crop top, the 27-year-old singer put her toned stomach on display as she snapped pictures at home.

The skimpy garment also offered a look at Cher's tattoo collection, with the Swagger Jagger hitmaker flashing the inkings on her arms and hands.  

Cher teamed her top with graffiti print jogging bottoms and painted her face expertly with a slick of cat eyeliner teamed with bronze eye shadow. 

Back in May, Cher revealed she's accepted her 'lumps and bumps' and declared her 'mum stripes' are not going to stop her from 'squeezing into a pair of tiny beaded knickers and flaunting my stuff'.

The Lost hitmaker shared: 'I find it so strange, but I’m a lot more confident about my body now after having a child than I was before. 

'It’s weird, because before pregnancy I was skinny, I had no stretch marks and no lumps and bumps.

'Roll on to now and I’ve got tiger stripes from my thighs all the way over to my bum and there’s nothing I can do about that, it is what it is. But I see them as my proud mum stripes. I grew a human. So what if there are a few lumps and bumps now?'

Proud mother: Her post comes after she insisted in May that she's accepted of her 'lumps and bumps' since welcoming her daughter Delilah-Rae in May 2018 (pictured in January 2018)

On transforming her appearance from her 'tomboy' days, the Want U Back hitmaker told The Sun: 'Over the last few years I’ve thought: "Sod it, I don’t give a s**t what people want to call me or label me." I will wear whatever I want to and what makes me feel comfortable.

The star said she had learned as a mother that there was more to life than 'obsessing' over her image as her number one priority was now her daughter.

Cher shares her daughter with husband Craig Monk, who she wed in 2013.
