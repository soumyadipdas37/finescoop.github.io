A cocaine shipment valued at $142 million was confiscated from a speedboat by the Mexican military in a bust caught on video. 

According to the Secretariat of the Navy, the massive drug bust occurred Tuesday night in Mahahual, Quintana Roo.

The marines and the Secretariat of National Defense were surveilling the area when a military helicopter and plane detected the speedboat and started to pursue it. The small vessel was intercepted 84 miles east off the fishing village.

Mexico's Secretariat of the Navy said the military took part in the high speed pursuit of three individuals aboard a boat 84 miles off the coast of Mahahual, a fishing village in the state of Quintana Roo, on Tuesday. A total of 2,960 kilos of cocaine were seized

The Mexican military said 2,960 kilos of cocaine were divided in 74 plastic-wrapped bundles

Footage shared with the media showed the moment a soldier was lowered to the boat before three individuals were taken into custody. 

The identities and nationalities of the drug smugglers is unknown.

The speedboat was taken to a nearby port where the military removed 2,960 kilos of cocaine that had been split into 74 plastic-wrapped bundles.

Tuesday's massive drug bust was the second since last Friday when the Mexican military detected a small jet near the border with Guatemala and forced it to land at an airport in the southern state of Chiapas

'The maritime, air and land surveillance operations carried out by this institution are carried out in order to inhibit criminal action, guarantee security and maintain the rule of law on the Mexican coasts,' the Secretariat of the Navy said in a statement.

The large cocaine bust came four days after the military fight jets intercepted a small aircraft in Mexican air space and escorted it to Palenque International Airport in Palenque, Chiapas. 

An inspection of the Dassault Falcon twin engine jet led military officers to $65 million worth of cocaine and arrested two men, including the pilot.
