A second day of anti-lockdown protests in Victoria has seen hundreds of demonstrators swarm Queen Victoria Market.

At least 100 police officers, including those from Public Order Response unit, have the group surrounded and several people have already been arrested.

The 'Freedom Walk' comes one day after 14 people were arrested on Saturday for breaking COVID-19 restrictions.

On Sunday, hundreds of people took to the streets again, chanting 'freedom' and demanding draconian lockdown restrictions be eased.  

Melbourne remains in a Stage Four lockdown, meaning residents cannot leave their houses without a valid reason, and restrictions are in place to limit movement more than 5km from a person's home.

The restrictions remain in place, and both a State of Emergency and State of Disaster, have both been extended a further four weeks despite the embattled state only recording 41 new cases and seven deaths on Sunday.   

The latest figures released on Sunday morning take the state's death toll to 723 and the national count to 810 since the start of the pandemic in late January.

The second protest for the weekend comes hours after a woman shared footage of police dragging her from a car.

The masked driver refused to get out of her car after talking with an officer about a phone charger at Wallan, about 60km north of the city.

More to come.
