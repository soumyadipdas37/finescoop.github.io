She has been the highlight of the very 2020 fashion weeks.   

And Maisie Williams was again stealing the show as she led the glamour at the Chloé Paris Fashion Week show on Thursday afternoon. 

The Game Of Thrones star, 23, went for an androgynous ensemble with a knitted jumper layered over a white shirt and loose-fitting camel coloured trousers.

Maisie was a vision in her chic ensemble as she sported the patterened knit with a white shirt layered underneath to add an elegant touch. 

Her spunky new bleached hair do was worn in a mussed style with roots on show while she covered her made-up face with a face covering.  

A legion of other fashionistas were present at the showcase. 

Paris is set to impose strict new regulations in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases.

Emmanuel Macron's government has ordered bars in Paris, along with Lyon and nine other cities on 'heightened alert', to close at 10pm.

There is also a 10-person restriction at public gatherings with attendees at weddings and parties limited to 30. 

Gyms and other indoor sporting facilities will also remain closed and it remains mandatory for all pedestrians to wear face masks in public areas in the capital.

The move comes as the president tries to avoid imposing a full lockdown across the country with the French economy already set to shrink by 8.7 per cent this year.

The French government recently announced that it would be pumping €100billion (£91billion) into the economy as part of a recovery plan. 

Politician Macron hopes that this will help the French economy to get moving again by 2022. 

Paris Fashion Week, which is set to host presentations by Kenzo, Kenneth Ize and Schiaparelli, will end on October 6.
