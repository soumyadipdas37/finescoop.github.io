Australians have sparked a heated debate on social media over what they typically call the end of a loaf of bread - and the answers are very different.

Mother-of-three Kate Freebairn, the founder of The Pantry Mama, asked her followers what term they used to describe the first and last slices of the bread.

'What do you call the end piece of bread? And do you eat it?' she wrote on Facebook.

The post provoked much discussion among Australians, with a majority of people labelling the end pieces as the 'crust'.

However, many had their own suggestions for its name, including 'heel', 'end piece', 'doorstep', 'butt', 'topper', 'bunty', 'knobby', 'bird food', 'cuppy' and 'my husband's'.

'My hubby and I argue about this. I call it "the crust" or the "end of the bread" and hubby grew up in a Dutch family and he calls it "the cuppy",' one woman said.

A second woman agreed, saying she also describes them as crusts in her household.

'Not fussed about commercial loaves but we keep the crusts on good bread to keep the ends fresh. Once we reach the end of the loaf my husband and I have an unwritten pact to share the crusts,' she said.

A third woman said: 'We call it the crust. We only eat it if we're low on bread.'

Another popular answer for the end slices was the 'heel', which is a common term used in the UK and the US.

'The heel. And yes [I do eat it], but only if I put butter on it and throw it under the broiler until it gets a little brown,' one woman said.

A second woman said: 'The heel or the best first slice.'

Others suggested unique terms to describe the end pieces of the bread, such as the 'topper', 'butt', 'knobby', 'the nub', 'petiche', 'bunty' or 'knob'.

'We call it the bum bit - the fight to eat it first is real between my partner and my daughter,' one woman said.

Many said eating the end pieces depended on the 'type of bread' while others suggested it'll only be consumed if it's a fresh loaf from the bakery or home baked (stock image)

A second woman said: 'Depends on the bread type... if it's a loaf then crust but a French stick, it's the elbow... If you eat it, your mother-in-law will like you more (I grew up with that saying).'

A third suggested: 'The Nickelback because nobody likes it but me.'

Another woman said her family calls it 'Kontje', which is Dutch for 'bum'.

'My kids eat them. Actually they fight over them,' she added.

Many said eating the end pieces depended on the 'type of bread' while others suggested it'll only be consumed if it's a fresh loaf from the bakery or home baked.

'In my opinion, it's one of the most coveted slabs of home baked hot bread -but only when straight out of the oven and smothered with butter,' one woman said.

This follows a similar debate that erupted on Twitter at the end of 2018 when Nigella Lawson weighed in on topic, calling it an 'elbow on a baguette'.
