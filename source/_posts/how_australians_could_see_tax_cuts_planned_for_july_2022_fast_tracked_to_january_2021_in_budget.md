Australians on higher incomes stand to receive $2,565 when future tax cuts are brought forward into next week's federal budget.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's second budget on Tuesday night is set to feature the biggest deficit since the end of World War II as Australia tried to stimulate an economy that slipped into its sharpest economic downturn since the 1930s Great Depression as a result of coronavirus lockdowns.

With Australia now in recession for the first time in almost three decades, income tax cuts originally earmarked for July 2022 are set to be fast-tracked to January 2021 - benefiting more than 10million taxpayers.

Another stage of tax cuts and a flattening of income tax brackets, due to take effect in 2024, could also be brought forward despite surging government debt.

Australians on higher incomes stand to receive $2,565 tax cuts a year when Treasurer Josh Frydenberg delivers his second budget on Tuesday night

Economist Saul Eslake said the Treasurer may not wait for the start of the new financial year in July 1 next year to bring forward the cuts as the government desperately sought stimulus for the moribund economy.

 Should income tax cuts due in July 2022 be brought forward to early next year?

'They could be brought forward to any date that he chose,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's probably easier if it was July 2021 because that means you have the same tax rate for the whole financial year but certainly governments have started new tax rates midway through financial years before, certainly I can remember it in the seventies.'

Another renowned economist Chris Richardson, a partner at Deloitte Access Economics, said while the rich would benefit most from the tax cuts, they were still broadly fair - even if they were expensive.

'People have often heard that the tax cuts are unfair: they're not,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

In his first budget, unveiled in April 2019 ahead of the election, Mr Frydenberg announced that those earning $120,000 or more would receive $2,565 worth of annual tax cuts from the middle of 2022

'They arguably are too big and it turns out the economy is not necessarily in as good a position to support the tax cuts.' 

Deloitte Access Economics calculates fast tracking the July 2022 tax cuts would cost $12.35billion with the low and middle-income tax offset kept in place.

The fast-tracked tax cuts announced by Mr Frydenberg in his inaugural budget last year would give those earning $120,000 or more $2,565 worth of annual tax cuts from the middle of 2022.

Those earning $90,000 would get $1,215, compared with 2017-18.

Low-to-middle income earners on $50,000 to $80,000 would get $1,080 early while those on $40,000, barely above the minimum wage, would get a $580 cut.

That was when the 32.5 per cent personal income tax bracket was to be moved from $90,000 to $120,000, as part of the second stage of tax cuts.

Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson argued permanently boosting JobSeeker beyond its base rate of $565.70 a fortnight would do more to stimulate the economy, with the second coronavirus supplement of $250 due to end on December 31

Mr Richardson argued permanently boosting JobSeeker beyond its base rate of $565.70 a fortnight would do more to stimulate the economy, with the second coronavirus supplement of $250 due to end on December 31.

'There's always been a great case for an unemployment benefit of more than $40 a day,' he said.

'Where you live is a striking driver of how much financial pain COVID is causing and if want to have the best regional economic policy, there's another reason to raise the unemployment benefit permanently.'

Mr Eslake said higher-income Australians receiving a tax cut from Mr Frydenberg were more likely to pay down their credit card or mortgage than spend the money, which would in turn create jobs.

'You can't guarantee that they're going to take it out of their pockets and spend it,' he said. 

'Both economic theory and history tell you that the more that tax cuts are skewed towards middle and higher-income earners, the less likely it is that they will take it out and spend it and instead they'll use at least some of it to pay down debt or to save it.'

Mr Frydenberg, the Liberal Party's deputy leader, has given several hints in media interviews about the fast tracking of the 2022 tax cuts. 

Mr Eslake said $1,000 tradeable vouchers that had to be spent on Australian tourism businesses or live theatre shows by June 2022 would be a better way of stimulating employment in COVID-19-hit sectors. 

'Go to a concert or something, spend it in areas that are still being affected by restrictions that after all the government is imposing,' he said.  

He added repairs to public housing and roads would do more to create local jobs around Australia than big-ticket rail and highway infrastructure projects.

Westpac chief economist Bill Evans is forecasting a budget deficit for 2020-21 of $240billion, which would see net debt as a proportion of the economy climb from 19 per cent a year ago to 37 per cent now.

Treasury's Economic and Fiscal Update, released on July, projected Australia's gross government debt would surge to $851.9billion by the end of this financial year, making up 45 per cent of gross domestic product. 

Mr Eslake is expecting next week's budget to show gross government debt of $1 trillion within the next two years, nonetheless pointing out its share of GDP would still be lower than what it was between 1901 and 1963. 

Australia's economy shrunk by a record seven per cent in the June quarter and the data since hasn't been that encouraging.

Building approvals in August fell by 1.6 per cent, surprising financial markets who had expected a flat result.

In an ominous sign New South Wales, Australia's most populated state, suffered a 14.2 per cent decline in project sign-offs.

The economic malaise could even accelerate another round of tax cuts. 

Under a third stage of tax cuts announced last year, the 37 per cent tax bracket would be abolished from July 1, 2024 and a new 30 per cent tax bracket created for all individuals earning between $45,001 and $200,000.

The number of tax brackets would be slashed from five to four for the first time since 1984.
