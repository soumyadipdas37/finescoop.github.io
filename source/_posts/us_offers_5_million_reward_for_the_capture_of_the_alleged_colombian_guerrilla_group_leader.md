The United States Department of Justice has offered a $5million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of an alleged leader of a Colombia guerrilla group.

Wilver Villegas Palomino is accused of 'narco-terrorism, international cocaine distribution conspiracy, and international cocaine distribution' by the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas. 

A warrant for his arrest was issued February 13, 2020.

Villegas Palomino, who is in his late 30s, is ranking leader with the National Liberation Army, which is recognized as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the European Union, Colombia, Venezuela's National Assembly and Canada.

Villegas Palomino is suspected of of drug trafficking activities in the Catatumbo region of Colombia and Venezuela.

The United States offered a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Wilver Villegas Palomino, a top ranking leader for the National Liberation Army, a revolutionary left-wing armed group in Colombia.

The announcement was made Monday by United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who last week toured Latin America, meeting with the leaders of Colombia, Brazil, Guyana and Suriname.

'We're offering up to $5M for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of indicted narcoterrorist Wilver Villegas Palomino,' Pompeo tweeted. 'The U.S. is committed to helping the Colombian government disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations operating in the region.'

According to the Colombian Resource Center for Conflict Analysis, the National Liberation Army has been linked to a number of attacks that have left 38 people dead between January and August, a 31 percent increase compared with the same period in 2019.

The National Liberation Army, founded in 1962, reportedly has 2,500 fighters. 

The paramilitary group allegedly orchestrated a 2019 car bombing outside a Bogotá police academy that killed 22 police cadets and injured 89 people.

The reward for Villegas Palomino's apprehension was revealed by the United States after six young men were killed Sunday following after a grenade exploded at local cockfighting venue in Cauca, a province in southwestern Colombia.  

It is unknown if the National Liberation Army was involved with the deadly incident.

The reward, which is offered as part of the Department of Justice's Narcotics Rewards Program, has led to the arrest and conviction of more than 75 drug traffickers since the program was introduced in 1986. 

The DOJ reports more than $130 million in rewards for information leading to the arrest of narco capos.
