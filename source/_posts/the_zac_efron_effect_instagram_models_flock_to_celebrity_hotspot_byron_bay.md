Instagram models and Bachelor stars have flocked to NSW celebrity enclave Byron Bay as the Queensland border is currently closed.

Apart from being the home of the Hemsworth brothers, Hollywood A-lister Zac Efron is also living in the coastal town with his girlfriend Vanessa Valladares - a local waitress he met in July.

Now, models Natalie Roser, Georgia Gibbs, Shannon Lawson, Laura Dundovic and Cassie Cameron have all headed to Byron on holiday.

'Girls trip to Byron tomorrow. Any recommendations on where I can spot Zac Efron, find a nice coffee/cocktail bar or even suggest a few secret beaches?' Shannon wrote on Instagram.

Meanwhile, Laura posted a photo of herself with Natalie and Georgia, which she captioned: 'BYRON BAECATION OFF TO A MAGIC START.'

The ladies have been documenting their trip on Instagram with endless pictures of themselves in bikinis, activewear and summer dresses.

Natalie posted a picture of herself in a tie-dye dress, and said in the caption that she loves Byron for its warm weather, pristine beaches, food and coffee.
