Thiago Alcantara has reportedly agreed personal terms with Liverpool and the Bayern Munich midfielder is currently spending time on holiday in Barcelona.

The Spain international's wife posted a photo of a relaxed looking Thiago with her and their children captioned: 'The four of us,' after he was given an extended break by the Bundesliga giants following the Nations League fixtures.

The report however states that the club agreeing a transfer fee remains a stumbling block, with last season's treble winners reticent to let him depart for anything less than £27.5million (€30m).

The German outlet also claims Thiago is not expected to report for Bayern Munich training until next week, with the 29-year-old keen to resolve his future as soon as possible.

Thiago's Bayern Munich colleagues were back in training on Tuesday, including both Niklas Sule and new signing Leroy Sane who had featured for Germany in the past week.

But the Spain international is reportedly desperate to link up with Jurgen Klopp's men 

But Spain international Thiago will not be joining them this week after being pictured having a relaxing time on a beach in Barcelona. 

Bayern boss Hansi Flick offered very little update on the former Barcelona playmaker's future, adding that he remains in his plans as long as he is part of his squad.

As stated by Sportsmail, Thiago's future could hinge on the future of Georginio Wijnaldum, who is set for talks with Klopp upon his return.

Should Barcelona give Liverpool the chance to cash in on Wijnaldum, it would pave the way for Liverpool to move for Thiago.
