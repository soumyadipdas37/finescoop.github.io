Mexican military fighter jets intercepted a small plane transporting $65 million worth of cocaine near the Guatemala border in southern Mexico.

The Air Force jets were dispatched after a Dassault Falcon twin engine was detected in Mexico's air space early Friday, the Secretary of National Defense said.

The plane was escorted to a dirt field next to Palenque International Airport in Palenque, Chiapas.

'This is the result of the intense work carried out by the personnel of the [armed forces] as well as their experience, loyalty, disposition and commitment, which shows that social trust in the [military] is the best evaluation we have of our performance, always in benefit of the people of Mexico,' the Secretary of National Defense said in a statement.

The massive overhaul comes five days after the Colombian military and police seized a submarine that was transporting 1,055 kilos of cocaine off the coast of Colombia. 

The drugs, which had been purchased by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, were due to be delivered this week.
