Her sister Marina also has a public social media account, with nearly 4,000 followers, and often shares photographs of her stunning family.

Despite backlash over Londoners escaping to visit their second homes at the start of the UK's coronavirus-related lockdown, Lady Amelia fled to her parents' home in Cambridge in late March. Pictured: A snap of the area, shared by the royal to her Instagram in April 

Amelia has previously suggested that her Instagram account is just a snapshot of her life, with the eco-friendly royal revealing that she tries to live as sustainably as possible and often borrows clothes from brands for events.

The royal fled to her parents' house in Cambridge in late March, joining the Londoners escaping to visit their second homes at the start of the UK's coronavirus-related lockdown.

She shared a snap of the city dated 23 March, a week after the government advised against all non-essential travel and fears mounted that capital dwellers could be spreading the disease across the country.
