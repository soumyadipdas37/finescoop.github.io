Taylor Swift has come a long way in her career, since taking the country music world by storm more than a decade ago.

But the 10-time Grammy winner has recently returned to her roots, where she was met with open arms. 

She sparkled Wednesday in a crimson sequined turtleneck, as she arrived at the historic Grand Ole Opry in Nashville to perform at the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards.

The 30-year-old tucked the top into a pair of high-waisted khaki trousers, which were lined in pink stitching.

She finished the ensemble with a pair of black strappy kitten heels, featuring a gold chain around the ankle.   

Taylor later performed the single Betty from her recent eighth studio album Folklore, her first performance at a country music awards show in seven years.

She took to the dark, bare stage for a stripped-down, backlit performance of the popular track.

The Teardrops On My Guitar artist sat on a stool, playing a black acoustic guitar, while serenading the empty room.

Taylor's latest album surprise dropped in July, and it's spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart.

She last performed at the ACM Awards with Tim McGraw and Keith Urban in 2013, before officially making her transition to pop the next year with her fifth album 1989.

The Lover artist teased the performance earlier this month on her Instagram Story, writing: 'Bout to show up at your party @acmawards'

Although she's not nominated this year, she ended up in last year's Video of the Year category, after appearing on Sugarland's track Babe. 

After a five month delay, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, this year's show was moved from Las Vegas to Nashville for the first time, with no live audience.

Performers like Swift hit the stage at three historic locations for country music, including Grand Ole Opry, Ryman Auditorium and the Bluebird Cafe.
