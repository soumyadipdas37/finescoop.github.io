DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for Jon who have so for not been available for comment.  

The publication has viewed a report from the CYS, that describes the allegation of 'causing bodily injury to a child through recent act/failure to act: hitting/punching.' 

While Jon is not specifically named in the report, the details are consistent with the claims made by Collin on his Instagram last week. 

Last week, in a now-deleted Instagram post, Collin accused his father Jon of physically beating him. The alleged altercation is said to have taken place when Collin was upset in the car with Jon.

According to PEOPLE, Collin's deleted post read: 'Yesterday he beat me up and thought nothing of it, he punched me in the face and gave me a swollen nose and I started bleeding. He then continued to kick me in the ribs after I was on the floor. He is a liar.'

Meanwhile, in a statement to PEOPLE, his mother Kate said: 'You do not punch and kick your children. You do not kick a child. I don't want to hear any excuses from anyone, not from his father, not from local law enforcement, not from court personnel whose job is supposedly to ensure the best interests of my children.' 

'There is a child abuse law, PA 23, section 8i states that doing any of the following, regardless of whether it causes injury, is child abuse, and first on that list is kicking. Period."
