Faye Brookes was in good spirits as she enjoyed an outing with her brother Jack in Manchester on Sunday.

The actress, 33, put on a stylish display in her ensemble that saw her tuck in a chic blue top into a pair of navy and gold high-waist shorts.

Putting on a leggy display in the ensemble, Faye boosted her height in a pair of chic punk heels that had stud detailing across the front.

Faye's raven tresses were styled into loose waves that fell over her face well, and she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion. 

She colour-coordinated the look by keeping her personal items in a blush pink handbag, while she accessorised with a pair of gold hoop earrings.

 Faye's brother Jack put on a casually chic display in a long-sleeved white top that had 'couture' written across the front, and which he paired with grey plaid trousers.

Last year, Faye went public with her romance with boyfriend Joe Davies, after her split from ex-fiancé Gareth Gates.

She confirmed her new romance with the personal trainer in late November as they made their red carpet debut at the White Christmas musical press night. 

During the night, the actress leaned into Joe as he placed a hand on the small of her back, indicating the friends had grown closer since Faye's relationship with Gareth ended last July.

Gareth, 36, is said to have found love with Ibiza DJ Chloe McLennan, having split from the actress last year.

Gareth celebrated his birthday last month with a group of family and friends, as well as with Chloe.

Posting a snap to Instagram, he added the caption: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.'

Romance: A source said, 'They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since' 

He didn't tag Chloe in the post but she was present with his nearest and dearest.

A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April. They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since.'

Indeed, comments have materialised online under social media snaps, with Gareth writing 'Mmmmm' under one of Chloe's sultry snaps.
