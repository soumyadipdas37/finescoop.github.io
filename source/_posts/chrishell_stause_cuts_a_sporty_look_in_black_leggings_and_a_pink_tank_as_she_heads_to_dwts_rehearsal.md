Stause spoke to ET earlier in the day about her decision to join the competition show.   

She added: 'An experience I can kinda throw myself into and just kind of learn a new skill and have fun at the same time. I have no dance experience, so it's going to at least be a laugh for all of us.'

Additionally, she admitted to wanting to 'change the narrative' from her headline-making split with Hartley and feud with her Selling Sunset costar Christine Quinn. 

In July, she also revealed the heartbreaking news that her mother passed away after a battle with lung cancer, after losing her father to the same cancer last April.
