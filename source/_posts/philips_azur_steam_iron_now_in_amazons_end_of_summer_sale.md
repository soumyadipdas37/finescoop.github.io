When it comes to getting through your laundry pile fast, a steam iron is the way to go. Designed to do the hard work for you, the Phillips Azur Steam Iron has several features that make light work out of boring chores. 

While not cheap, the Philips Azur Steam Iron is equipped with a handy 250g steam boost that promises to penetrate deeper into fabrics to easily remove stubborn creases. 

The 2600W delivers a fast heat-up and powerful performance to get your ironing done quickly so you can whizz through your clothes, bedding and everything else in the laundry pile.  

While some Amazon shoppers have noted that the iron is heavier than others, there are many who have said this actually helps cut through the creases. Plus, as it's speedier than most irons, the weight doesn't pose too much of a problem. 

One customer wrote in their review: 'Cuts through stubborn creases due to its weight, she is a heavy one. But worth it. Buy one. Its brilliant effortless ironing.'

The Philips Azur is designed with a large 300ml water tank to reduce the number of times you need to re-fill, which means you can get your ironing done in one go. It also has a drip-stop system to prevent any leakages and avoid staining your garments with water droplets. 

The Philips Azur Steam Iron has a strong and consistent steam output that penetrates through fabric to remove creases faster

If you find that your iron often sticks or scratches, you'll love the SteamGlide Advanced sole plate on the Philips Azur. The advanced titanium layer enables more comfortable ironing on any fabric, including cotton, linen and wool. 

With over 1,100 ratings and an impressive average score of 4.6 out of 5 on Amazon, the Philips Azur Steam Iron is a big hit among reviewers. 

One delighted shopper wrote: 'Makes ironing a joy. The most wonderful iron, glides over everything and does an excellent job.'

Another raved: 'Fantastic iron. Very easy to use and just glides over the clothes. For someone who doesn't like ironing it's become quite therapeutic. A friend recommended it to me as it was rated highly in the Which magazine. Really like it.'

A third commented on the iron's efficiency, writing: 'This iron does a great job and you can get through a pile of ironing with little effort. 

'The temperature setting is clear and easily changed through the ironing session to accommodate all different materials. The shape of the sole plate makes getting into awkward corners easy and it is a really efficient iron.'
