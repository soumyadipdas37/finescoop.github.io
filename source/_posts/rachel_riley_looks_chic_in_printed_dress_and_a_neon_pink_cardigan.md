She is the Countdown star who is known for her effortless sense of style.

And Rachel Riley looked sensational as she left the Countdown studios in Manchester on Monday.

The blonde beauty, 34,  looked chic in a red and plum geometric print dress as she prepared to head home.

The star displayed her trim figure and toned legs in the dress, which she paired with black tights and vertiginous heels.

 The outing comes as Rachel revealed her hopes for baby daughter Maven, nine months, to be bilingual as husband Pasha Kovalev only talks to her 'solely in Russian'.

The Countdown star appeared on last Thursday's episode of Good Morning Britain where she sweetly spoke about her family.

Discussing baby daughter Maven, she said: 'She's got teeth, she's biting us, she's all about chat chat chat!

'Pasha is speaking to her solely in Russian and I'm speaking to her in English so we're hoping she'll be bilingual.'

Rachel sweetly added: 'She's so mobile, she's crawling and can walk with one hand now.'  

The maths whizz also shared that she will be teaching her daughter mathematics but joked: 'At the moment, she can bash cups together!'

Rachel also shared details of the regulations on set for Countdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Cute: Discussing baby daughter Maven, she said: 'She's got teeth, she's biting us, she's all about chat chat chat! Pasha is speaking to her solely in Russian and I'm speaking to her in English so we're hoping she'll be bilingual.'

She said: 'We were quite lucky, but we lost our audience which is a shame as they come time and time again, we're like a little family.

'The person who comes and takes the letters from me is in full hazmat gear and has a spatula!' 

Rachel, Pasha and Maven have spent lockdown with her Russian mother-in-law Galina, whose month-long visit to the UK was extended amid the pandemic.   

The couple, who became first-time parents to Maven in December and met on Strictly Come Dancing, have been enjoyed extended time off at home amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Updates: Rachel sweetly added: 'She's so mobile, she's crawling and can walk with one hand now.'

Speaking on Heart Breakfast with Jamie Theakston and Lucy Horobin, the blonde recently admitted the countrywide lockdown has been something of a blessing for the family as they have been given 'enforced maternity and paternity leave'.

The Oxford University alum said: 'Well we're quite fortunate in a way, I was supposed to be back at work, Pasha was supposed to be on tour, and it's kind of enforced maternity and paternity leave we didn't have before so we're loving it.

'She's just over five months, I've left her in bed in kind of the same sleeping position as Pash, if you hear crying it could be either one of them I have no idea.'
