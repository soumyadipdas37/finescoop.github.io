She welcomed her third child, son Huska, on Friday. 

And now Big Brother star Krystal Forscutt has showed off her post-baby body, just five days after giving birth. 

On Wednesday, the 33-year-old posed up for a mirror selfie in her bra and undies while cradling her newborn and sharing an empowering message to fans. 

'Blisters on my nipples and it hurts to sit down': On Wednesday, Big Brother star Krystal Forscutt showed off her post-baby body just five days after giving birth 

'Five days postpartum - blisters on my nipples and it hurts to sit down,' Krystal wrote on Instagram.  

'I am deliriously tired but I'm just so in love!'

She went on to call the newborn stage the fourth trimester and said that nothing can prepare you for the 'long nights' and 'overwhelming emotions.'

'Knowing this is my last [child] I've decided to surrender to the process, give myself and my postpartum body some grace and focus on celebrating small wins, like getting more than 2hrs sleep at a time, drinking a cup of tea while it's still hot and finding time to shave my legs.' 

She said first-time mothers might struggle with the newborn stage or 'feel like you're constantly swimming and barely keeping your head above water,' but said she's trying to 'savour' every little moment that she can. 

'I'm trying not to wish it away, trying to embrace it and savour the little moments that really aren't so little at all,' Krystal said.

Krystal announced on Saturday that she and builder husband Neil Hipwell welcomed a baby boy, who they named Huska Hipwell.

Krystal shared a sweet black and white video on Instagram announcing the news, saying: 'He's here and we are beyond obsessed.' 

The brunette beauty said that she and her husband welcomed their son on Friday and said that they're in a 'newborn bubble.'

On Friday, Krystal revealed with fans that she made the tough decision to be induced, because her doctor was going to be away on the weekend.

She and Neil are based in Sydney's Cronulla with their family, including children, Nakoda, one, and Sunny, five.
