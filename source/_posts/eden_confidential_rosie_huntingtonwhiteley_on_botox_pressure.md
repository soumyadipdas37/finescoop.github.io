She is one of the world’s most beautiful women, but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley feels under pressure to submit to cosmetic treatments nevertheless.

The Devon-born M&S model, 33, lives in LA with her fiance, Hollywood hardman Jason Statham, and son Jack, three.

And she’s regularly told she needs injections of toxins. 

‘I don’t like to try anything extreme,’ says Rosie.

‘I’m cautious, especially in LA where people are like, “Do you want breakfast and Botox?” and I’m like, “Uh, no. I’ll take the breakfast and you can keep the Botox.”’

At least she doesn’t have to fret about her famous pout. 

‘I never worry about my lips,’ she adds. ‘They stay in good shape.’ Phew!

Tim Rice suffers an identity crisis

He won an Oscar for The Lion King and made millions with his lyrics for West End hits, but Sir Tim Rice is feeling a little unrecognised.

Reminiscing about working with U.S. pop star Cyndi Lauper in 1989, he says: ‘It was soon clear that she hadn’t a clue who I was, so I managed to subtly inform her that I’d written the words for One Night In Bangkok, which had been a massive hit in the States.

‘And by the time I’d flung Superstar and Evita into the mix, Cyndi’s enthusiasm had perked up a bit.’

He adds: ‘Funnily enough, I met her in a restaurant in Barnes about 25 years later, and on that occasion she thought I was [impresario] Robert Stigwood.’ 

Ouch. 

Known as the king of Saturday night TV when he presented hit shows such as Stars In Their Eyes and Game For A Laugh, Matthew Kelly (pictured at the press night performance of Sleepless: The Musical at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre) has turned down the chance to win a new generation of fans by competing on Strictly Come Dancing

Known as the king of Saturday night TV when he presented hit shows such as Stars In Their Eyes and Game For A Laugh, Matthew Kelly has turned down the chance to win a new generation of fans by competing on Strictly Come Dancing.

‘I was offered Strictly,’ he tells me at the first night of Sleepless, A Musical Romance, at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre. 

‘While the money was good, I turned them down because I need to sell my work, not my life. 

'Dancing is not my thing at all, and I don’t really like reality TV shows.’
