It is not often Tyson Fury finds himself flat on the canvas but that's what happened when he and brother Tommy met in the ring on Monday.

The pair were jokingly sparring when Tommy landed a left hand to the torso of Tyson, which sent the Gypsy King to the ground.

Footage of the light-hearted session, published on Twitter by boxing promoter Frank Warren, also showed Tommy cheekily putting one foot on Tyson in celebration after flooring the heavyweight champion.

Boxing promoter Frank Warren tweeted the footage on Monday after seeing the funny side 

Warren tweeted: 'Tommy Fury sends his big brother Tyson Fury crashing to the canvas in sparring.'

Fury took the knockdown in good humour and no doubt Deontay Wilder will be expecting a much tougher contest when the Gypsy King defends his world heavyweight title against him in December.  

Tommy Fury is himself planning a return to competitive boxing following his first knockout victory in December last year.

The Love Island star had wanted to get into the ring this year before coronavirus put a halt to any plans.

He tweeted on Monday informing fans that he would have 'fight news soon' and to 'keep their eyes peeled'.

Meanwhile, the two brothers will continue to help each other with their respective preparations.

Tommy revealed recently what it is like to step into the ring with Tyson although that was before he sent his older brother to the ground. 

He said: 'It is always good. I can learn everything off him. But there's not that much point sparring him because I can't land a shot!

'But the experience counts at the end of the day.'
