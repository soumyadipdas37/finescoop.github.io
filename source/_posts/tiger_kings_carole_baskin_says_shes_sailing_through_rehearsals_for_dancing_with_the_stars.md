She found fame thanks to Netflix's hit docu-series Tiger King.

And now Carole Baskin is enjoying more attention as she kicks up her heels as a contestant on ABC's Dancing With The Stars.

'It's so much easier than I thought it would be,' the 59-year-old big cat lover told People in an interview published Wednesday.

Kicking up her tiger heels: Carole Baskin, 59, is sailing through rehearsals for season 29 of Dancing With The Stars, telling People: 'It's so much easier than I thought it would be' 

Baskin is currently in rehearsals ahead of the reality competition's season 29 premiere on September 14.

She told People: 'When I first saw some clips on YouTube, I thought, 'There's no way that I'm going to be able to do that, not in 100 years of training,' But now, I'm like, 'Dang! This could potentially work.''

The founder of Florida's Big Cat Rescue acknowledged, however, that elements of the preparations do pose a challenge sometimes. 

'During rehearsal I'll do the routine 10 times in a row. By the 11th, my mind drifts and I've forgotten all the steps. Then it's time to regroup!' she explained.

Her goal, she added, is 'to be as good as I can so that I can stay on as long as I possibly can.' 

Celebrity status: Baskin, the founder of Fklorida's Big Cat Rescue, found fame thanks to Netflix's hit docu-series Tiger King and was invited to join the ABC reality competition

Baskin will be up against an eclectic mix of celebrities all vying to take home the Mirrorball trophy. 

The cast includes Backstreet Boys' AJ McLean, Selling Sunset's Chrishell Stause, former Bachelorette star Kaitlyn Bristowe, former NFL player Vernon Davis, Jesse Metcalfe, Monica Aldama (head coach from Netflix's Cheer), Anne Heche, Skai Jackson, One Day at a Time actress Justina Machado, The Real host Jeannie Mai, Grammy Award-winning rapper Nelly, Catfish host Nev Schulman, NBA superstar Charles Oakley, and Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir.

Meanwhile, it's just been announced that Derek Hough will be replacing Len Goodman at the judges table, joining returning judges Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tomoli.

Hough, 35, was a dancer on the show from 2007 to 2016 and has since been keeping busy as a judge on NBC's World of Dance alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo. 

Earlier this summer DWTS decided to ditch hosts Erin Andrews and Tom Bergeron for Tyra Banks.
