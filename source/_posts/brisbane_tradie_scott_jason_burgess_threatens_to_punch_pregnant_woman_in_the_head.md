An aggressive tradesman threatened to punch a pregnant woman in the head in an explosive road rage attack.

Scott Jason Burgess burst into a fit of rage as he tried merging onto Olsen Ave, in Southport in Brisbane, at about 4.30pm on October 16 last year.

The 33-year-old became angry when he heard a driver beeping their horn, and threatened to punch the terrified pregnant woman in the head. 

Scott Jason Burgess exploded into a fit of rage when a pregnant driver beeped her horn at him as he tried merging onto Olsen Ave, Southport in Brisbane about 4.30pm on October 16 last year 

'I'm going to punch you in the head you f***ing sl*t,' Burgess yelled at the woman, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. 

The woman start recording the incident and Burgess tried to snatch her phone off of her. 

He appeared in Southport Magistrates Court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to common assault. He was fined $1,000.  

'The disturbing factor about your offending is the loss of control and aggression you demonstrated in front of your children,' Magistrate Kerry Magee said.

Prosecutor Caitlin Usher told the court that it took police seven months to find Burgess following the incident. 

His lawyer, Brendan Beavon, told the court that his client feared for his two young daughters who were in the car at the time.

Outside court, Mr Beavon said his client was apologetic and that 'it would not happen again'.
