Former NRL star and boxer Joe Williams has opened up on his battle with depression and how he tried to end his life at the age of 28.

Nine years on from the attempted suicide, the former Penrith Panthers and South Sydney Rabbitohs halfback revealed it all started when he was just 13.

After suffering a devastating concussion Williams spiralled into a deep depression and developed suicidal thoughts.

'Since the concussion, there was a dialogue in my head that was negative and told me to end my life,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 

The Wiradjuri man struggled through his teenage years trying to make his way in rugby league as well as the pressures of coming of age.

'I went through the journey of living in the country, growing up Aboriginal and then moving to the city and finding alcohol and drugs and developing an addiction issue, to silence what was going through my head,' Williams said. 

Williams said at the time he was trying to 'figure out who he was'.

'As an Aboriginal boy, I was too white to be black and too black to be white, so I had issues with who I was as a person,' he said.

The former NRL player now travels around the country spreading awareness about depression and suicide.

Last year Williams accused the government of dragging their feet after the inquiry into the suicide of 14-year-old Dolly Everett.

Mr Williams told the ABC he noticed immediate action was taken after Dolly, a young non-indigenous girl, died, but that 'young people are dying here, and now there is no response'.

Mr Williams said after his own struggle with mental illness and alcohol addiction, he thinks the rhetoric needs to change to be more inclusive.

He has been working in suicide prevention in rural areas of Australia since 2012, after surviving his suicide attempt.

'It's about normalising that conversation and having the conversation with kids that speaking about this stuff is actually good,' Mr Williams said.

'That's where the community and the country can come together in healing and having difficult conversations because we're losing lives here.'

A new national register of suicide and self-harm data launched over the weekend is believed to be crucial in preventing more Australians from spiralling into self-harm.
