Love Island Australia star Phoebe Thompson has spoken about her very confronting experience at Fashion Week.

On Tuesday, the credit analyst, 28, said she walked the runway at the annual event when she was just 16 years old and witnessed the 'ugly side of the industry'.

'I'm 179cm and I'll never be a size 0 without starving myself. I walked in Fashion Week when I was 16 years old and there was vomit and sh*t in the models bathroom from purging and laxatives abuse,' she wrote on Instagram.

'This is the ugly side of modelling... people need to call this sh*t out,' she added.

Phoebe also explained the pressure models face when it comes to their weight and looking thin.

'Over the years I've seen so many girls shrink themselves into nothing and then be praised by their agencies and followers for starving themselves,' she wrote.

'People forget that this disorder is the highest killer of all mental illnesses... you may be thin but is it worth your hair falling out, losing your eye sight, destroying your bones and organs... most of all your happiness,' she continued.

She went on to say: 'Agencies that tell models to lose weight beyond what is healthy should be called out or even have legal consequences for they are encouraging harmful behaviour that has lead to many girls dying.'

'I can tag so many modelling agencies right now,' she said.

Phoebe rose to fame as a contestant on season two of Love Island Australia.

She entered the villa on Day 4 of the show but she was dumped from the island on Day 12. 

The reality star made Love Island Australia history by coupling up with co-star Cassie Lansdell and becoming the first same-sex couple.
