'Bad education is a great movie. That's the tweet. @RealHughJackman should get nominated for an Oscar,' raved one fan on Twitter. 

Wrote another fan: 'In an obvious slow start to movie releases in 2020, Hugh Jackman in Bad Education is in a clear lead for best performance.'  

Even the normally hard to please critics couldn't speak highly enough of Hugh's performance, with USA TODAY branding it 'great acting', while Decider called it an 'Oscar-worthy role'.

In an interview with Variety Hugh described the opportunity to portray real-life school superintendent Frank Tassone as 'fascinating'.       

'The role itself was something different from what I've done. I liked the idea of someone who is super successful, very, very good at what he did, beloved by the community - and fell down this slippery path,' he said.

And he described playing the villain as 'delicious' during an interview with Collider. 

'As an actor, it just had so much to play with, and so many things that I've never really had the opportunity to play with. He's seemingly very charming, but also just a viper... Those things, I just found really exciting to play,' he said.
