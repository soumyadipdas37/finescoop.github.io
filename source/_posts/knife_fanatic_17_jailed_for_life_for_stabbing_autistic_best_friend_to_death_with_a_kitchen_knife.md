A teen has been jailed for life for stabbing his autistic best friend to death with a kitchen knife during a row.

Trent Hutchinson, 17, plunged a knife into the back and skull of 18-year-old Ollie Wells outside his house, a court heard.

The young killer, who was said to have had a 'fascination with knives', had allowed his friend to sleep on a mattress in his bedroom in his mother's house.

During the stay, Ollie answered the door and spoke to some men who stopped by in a car.

Hutchinson, 16 at the time, accused Ollie of 'bringing trouble to the house', police said.

A fight broke out between them inside the home in Newhaven, Sussex, and Hutchinson punched Ollie. 

Ollie fled outside and was followed by Hutchinson, who then returned quickly and told his mother he had stabbed Ollie.

The court heard Ollie was stabbed twice with a knife taken from the house during the incident on 6 January.

He collapsed outside into the street where he died despite the efforts of Hutchinson's mother, and of paramedics who swiftly arrived.

Following the seven-day trial at Hove Crown Court, Judge Jeremy Gold QC allowed Hutchinson to be named after applications from media and Ollie's family.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday, with a minimum term of 14 years.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Wolstenholme of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: 'This tragic moment has had a terrible impact on two families which will live with them forever.

'One young man lost his life, cruelly and savagely murdered by another young man who he believed to be his best friend, who has consigned himself to tragically limited future.

'The families of both teenagers will undoubtedly feel that loss forever.

'Whatever the disagreement was between them that night, we may never know exactly why Ollie's murderer reacted in such an extreme and violent way.

'When interviewed, he said in a prepared statement that he acted in self-defence and intended Ollie no serious harm.

'However the injuries made it clear that this was no defensive action but rather a sustained and deliberate attack.

'Both as a police officer, and a resident of Sussex I am desperate not to see any more young lives cut short as a result of knife violence in our county.

'The impact of knives is huge and often not fully understood by those carrying them.

'If you know of people carrying knives, have information about knife violence or organised criminality involving the carriage of knives or other weapons, please help us to keep people safe by calling us and telling us what you know.

'Let's work together to avoid any other tragic and senseless losses as we have seen with the sad death of Ollie Wells.'

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Wolstenholme of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: 'This tragic moment has had a terrible impact on two families which will live with them forever' 

Ollie Wells' family said in a statement: 'Ollie's death and the horrific way he died has been devastating for our family, he was the youngest sibling and loved very much.

'Ollie was a very smiley, happy, cheeky boy and despite facing challenges due to his autism was well-liked and had a great deal of potential.

'He enjoyed many activities including horse-riding, sports and playing his flute, drums and guitar. He was also a very keen supporter of Chelsea football club.

'We realise that this terrible crime has had a devastating impact not only upon us, but also upon the lives of another young person and his family, but, ultimately feel that today's outcome is just and correct.

'We can only hope that somehow some good can come of Ollie's death, we will never forget him and are so sad he is no longer with us.'
