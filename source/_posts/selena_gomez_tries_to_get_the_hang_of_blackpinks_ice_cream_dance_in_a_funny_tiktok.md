Selena Gomez tried her hardest to recreate one of the dances from her Ice Cream music video with K-pop group BLACKPINK in a silly new TikTok shared Tuesday.

The 28-year-old star looked adorable as she moved around, mimicking the girl group's choreography.

But she hadn't exactly perfected the dance, seen shrugging while admitting 'I don't know' after going through the motions.

Practice makes perfect! Selena Gomez practiced her dance moves while learning BLACKPINK's routine from their Ice Cream music video

Selena looked radiant in the clip, where she had flowers pinned into her curls and rocked glam from her new Rare Beauty brand.

The former Disney Channel star kept her outfit simple as she reminded fans to vote with her tee-shirt, though it was largely hidden behind her locks.

It definitely looked like Selena was making the most of her indoor time.Â

She opened up about what she's learned about herself during quarantine while appearing on the Variety and iHeart podcast The Big Ticket last week.

'Itâ€™s definitely the most time Iâ€™ve spent on my own probably since I was 16,' the pop star/actress said.

'At first it was super uncomfortable, more so because of the anxiety I was carrying because of everything that is happening.

'I also feel like I got the opportunity to learn a lot about my country in ways that I never have before,' she went on.

Solo: In addition to learning dances at home Selena says she's been able to learn about herself while being alone. ''Itâ€™s definitely the most time Iâ€™ve spent on my own probably since I was 16,' she said in a recent interview

'I feel like Iâ€™ve gained a sense of knowledge and a sense of feeling good about saying what Iâ€™m saying, and I feel good about what Iâ€™m standing by, and Iâ€™m not going to let other opinions conduct what I feel personally.'

Gomez has been vocal about getting her generation to the polls.Â 

In June she shared a lengthy Instagram post where she wrote about systemic racism in the US.

'Everyone needs to have their voices heard and we can do that by VOTING,' she wrote. 'We will not let voter suppression stop us!'Â
