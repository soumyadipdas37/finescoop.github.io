The bodies of two missing teenage girls were on fire when villagers spotted them on the side of a road in western Mexico, authorities said.

The victims were identified as Andrea Lizeth, 14, and Brenda Guadalupe, 16, of Sinaloa. 

According to Mexican news outlet Milenio, authorities confirmed that an Amber Alert was never issued for their search after they were reported missing Sunday. It's unknown why the child abduction emergency system was not activated. 

The bodies of 14-year-old Andrea Lizeth and 16-year-old Brenda Guadalupe were still on fire when they were located by the police in Sinaloa, Mexico, on Wednesday. The girls had been reported missing August 30, but an Amber Alert was never issued.

Authorities have not announced any arrests following the gruesome finding of two teenage girls who were strangled and set on fire in Costa Rica, a municipality in the western Mexican state of Sinaloa

Police in the municipality of Costa Rica were alerted of the gruesome finding Wednesday at 7:30am.

A preliminary report showed the girls had been strangled before their bodies were dumped next to an empty grass field and set ablaze. 

One of the girls was found lying back down while the other victim was lying face up. 

Both girls were identified by their families at a morgue Thursday. 

DailyMail.com couldn't verify if Andrea Lizeth and Brenda Guadalupe knew each other.

Investigators canvass the area where two girls, aged 14 and 16, were found dead Wednesday in Sinaloa, Mexico. Data from the Sinaloa state prosecutor's office show that 101 male and female minors have been killed in the state since 2005

'These acts of horror and true savagery cannot and should not go unpunished,' said Reyna Araceli Tirado, director of the Sinaloan Institute for Women. 'We urge the State Attorney General's Office, as the governing body for the administration of justice in Sinaloa, so that these criminal acts are thoroughly investigated and thus can impart justice.' 

Data from the Sinaloa state prosecutor's office show that 101 male and female minors have been killed in the state since 2005.

At least 29 females have been been murdered in Sinaloa this year.
