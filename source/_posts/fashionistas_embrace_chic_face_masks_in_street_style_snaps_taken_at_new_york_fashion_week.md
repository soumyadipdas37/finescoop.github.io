The hottest accessory at New York Fashion Week this fall is one that no fashionista could have seen coming before 2020.

But as the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, fashion, too, has had to evolve to face this 'new normal' — and in August, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced new safety guidelines for Fashion Week, including limiting spectators at shows and capping the number of professionals allowed in a room at one time.

Still, the most elite fashionistas have managed to score invites to this seasons ultra-exclusive presentations, and as always, they're dressing the part.

This time, though, that means not just fabulous bags, cool shoes, and designer ensembles — it also means protective face masks.

These fashion fans are hardly wasting any opportunities when it comes to their newest accessories, using the face-coverings as stylish statement makers for an unprecedented time.

Fashion Week was last held in February, before the pandemic overtook the US — so this is the first time that the community must grapple with the new restrictions. 

 New York Fashion Week operated on a tighter schedule from September 13 to 17, shortened by several days from its typical length.

The event included live shows but shifted heavily toward virtual programming, with outdoor events capped at 50 people and indoor events restricted to 50 per cent capacity.  

Those restrictions applied not just to audience members, but those involved in the show: designers, models, stylists, makeup artists, and other staff members. 

While spectators weren't allowed at indoor events, some were able to attend outdoor events on the Spring Place rooftop. 

'New York City is the fashion capital of the world and New York Fashion Week celebrates the ingenuity of this city, and our unmatched creative talent,' Governor Cuomo, who has attended New York Fashion Week events in the past, said in a statement.  

'When COVID-19 hit New York, so many of our cherished events were forced to cancel or be postponed. The pandemic is far from over, but we're proud to support event organizer IMG in moving forward with NYFW, in adherence with strict state public health guidance. 

'Safety, as always, is our top priority and we commend the hosts, and all participating designers, for their innovative, New York Smart solutions to bring this event to life.'

Those present at the events were also be expected to adhere to social distancing, diagnostic testing, and health screening procedures — including temperature tests prior to admittance.

Face coverings were also required.

NYFW producer IMG worked closely with state officials to ensure compliance with Phase 4 reopening guidelines.  

'We are grateful to Governor Cuomo and his leadership for their swift, successful response in fighting the spread of the coronavirus, which has now set the standard of excellence for our nation,' the Executive Vice President of IMG's Fashion Events Group, Leslie Russo, said.

'The past six months have been exceedingly difficult for the fashion industry, and we are proud to offer an avenue for designers, models, stylists, hair and makeup artists, photographers, production teams — ­and the innumerable other professionals who work in, or adjacent to, the fashion industry during New York Fashion Week — to safely get back to work this September.'
