Eva Mendes penned a heartfelt message of love and support to Vanessa Bryant via the 38-year-old's Instagram comment section on Tuesday.

'I've always thought you were one of the most beautiful women ever. Then I met you and it was confirmed,' began the 46-year-old actress, who left her comment under a photo Vanessa uploaded of herself and daughter Natalia, 17. 

Mendes' thoughtful words came just days after the eight-month anniversary of Kobe Bryant and daughter Gianna 'Gigi' Bryant's tragic passing in January.

Eva continued: 'Everything about you shines. And then I met your girls and it all made sense. It comes from the parents. The family you all created.'

Vanessa and Kobe, who wed in 2001, share four daughters, Natalia, the late Gigi, 13, Bianka, three, and one-year-old Capri. 

'Thinking of you all more than you know. I cherish meeting you guys in such a special environment. Te adoro,' wrote Mendes.

To close out her comment, the 2 Fast 2 Furious star let Vanessa and her girls know that she, her partner Ryan Gosling, and their daughters, Esmeralda Amada, six, and Amada Lee, three, are there for support.

'We love you all!!! We're here for anything. Besos [HEART EMOJI] Eva, Ryan and the girls [HEART EMOJI].'

The sweet snapshot of Vanessa and daughter Natalia showed the pair posing in the backseat of vehicle, while donning cloth face masks.

'My baby @nataliabryant,' captioned Vanessa, who also added 'Love' onto the photo, itself.   

On January 26, Vanessa lost her husband Kobe and daughter Gianna in a horrific helicopter crash that killed six other passengers and the pilot.

Kobe was 41-years-old at the time of his death, while Gianna, who happened to be a rising female basketball star, was just 13-years-old.

Graphic photos of the helicopter crash were allegedly taken and shared by eight LA County Sheriff's Office deputies.

At the time of the incident, the Office had a policy against taking and sharing crime scene photos, but the policy did not extend to accident scenes. 

And on Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom approved new legislation that would make it illegal for first responders to take unauthorized photos of deceased people at the scene of an accident or crime.

The new measures will take effect from January 1 next year, and will make it a misdemeanor with fines up to $1,000 per offense to take such photos for anything other than an official law enforcement purpose.  

Newsom's new law comes after Vanessa filed a lawsuit against Sheriff Villanueva and his department over the photos and the 'emotional distress' their existence have caused her.

'No fewer than 8 sheriff's deputies at the crash site pulled out their personal cell phones and snapped photos of the dead children, parents and coaches. The deputies took these photos for their own personal gratification,' claimed Vanessa in the lawsuit.
