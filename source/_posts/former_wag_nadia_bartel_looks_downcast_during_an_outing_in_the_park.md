She has been enduring Melbourne's strict lockdown with her two two sons, Aston, four, and Henley, one, for weeks.

So Nadia Bartel was no doubt relieved to take her children to a playground in Albert Park on Monday, after some restrictions in the Victorian capital eased.

The mother-of-two doted over her boys as they excitedly played on the equipment in the spring sunshine.
