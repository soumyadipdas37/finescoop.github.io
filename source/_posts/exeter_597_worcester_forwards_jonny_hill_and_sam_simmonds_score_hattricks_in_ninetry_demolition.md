Forwards Jonny Hill and Sam Simmonds both scored hat-tricks as Exeter extended their lead at the top of the Premiership table to 14 points with a nine-try demolition of Worcester at Sandy Park.

Jack Nowell, Jacques Vermeulen and Stuart Hogg also crossed for Exeter, with Joe Simmonds adding seven conversions in a 59-7 victory.

Worcester, who selected virtually a reserve side to take on the leaders, could only muster a solitary late try from Ashley Beck in response, converted by Billy Searle.

ChiefsÂ extended their lead at the top of the Premiership to 14 points with nine-try demolition

Exeter's opening try came after only seven minutes when Sam Simmonds finished off an unstoppable line-out drive, and their second score arrived only two minutes later when well-executed passing and excellent support play saw Hill crash over.

Joe Simmonds converted both before Warriors had their best period of the match. They enjoyed plenty of possession to keep the home side at bay but lacked the potency to break down a well-organised Chiefs defence.

Exeter then showed them how to capitalise on scoring chances with Sam Simmonds forcing his way over after a succession of forward drives, before Nowell celebrated his first appearance since January by squeezing over in the corner.

The hosts had therefore secured their bonus point inside the first half-hour but there was still time for Hill to complete his hat-trick before half-time.

First he drove over from close range then supported an elusive run from Nowell to outflank the cover defence. Simmonds' conversion gave his side a 38-0 interval lead.

Jack Nowell, Jacques Vermeulen and Stuart Hogg also crossed for Exeter in resounding win

Thirty seconds after the restart, Exeter scored their seventh try when a long pass sent Alex Cuthbert flying down the left flank and his inside pass provided Hogg with an easy run-in.

Luke Cowan-Dickie had a try disallowed for an earlier infringement before Exeter withdrew Nowell after the wing had provided an action-packed 50 minutes.

Worcester suffered a setback when GJ Van Velze was helped off with an arm injury with Matt Cox replacing the number eight for his 100th appearance for the Warriors.

Chiefs rang the changes but it made no difference to the one-way traffic with the impressive Vermeulen's try taking the hosts past fifty points.

Simmonds then completed his hat-trick but, with 10 minutes remaining, Beck opened Worcester's account to prevent them recording a record league defeat.
