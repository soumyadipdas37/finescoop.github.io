She welcomed her 'miracle' baby boy in March this year after being given only one per cent chance of conceiving.

And Nadia Essex was the picture of a doting mother as she cradled son Ezekiel in her arms before taking him with her in his stroller as she got her hair done in London on Friday afternoon.

The TV personality, 38, was seen getting her highlights done at the Ozzie Rizzo Richmond salon, and she and the hairdresser wore a mask to make sure they kept safe amid the coronavirus crisis.

As the hairdressers got to work on her hair, Nadia was seen looking at her phone as her little one relaxed in his carrier beside her.

Nadia looked casually chic in a red striped longline jacket, which she shrugged on over a black tank top.

She completed her look with a pair of straight-cut jeans, while she stepped out in a pair of white trainers.

'There was a killer virus, I was going to have to go into lockdown alone and it was very difficult to not feel overwhelmed on top of the usual craziness of being a new, first time mum. 

'Since then you have grown into the most wonderful boy. I am absolutely grateful and amazed that you are my son.'

Nadia went on to lament the fact single mothers are often seen as inferior to single fathers.

She continued: 'Often single mothers are thought of as trash and single fathers as hero's. I am so proud to be your mummy. Proud to have done it alone. Proud we are a team and proud you are my best friend. 

'If you feel like this remember it's ok. All the 'perfect' mums on SM have had these days too. Know that these feelings pass, things get easier and you will be ok. Sending love and strength to everyone who needs it ❤️.' 

It comes after Nadia revealed she's shed a total of seven pounds in just a month by using the DoTheUnthinkable fitness plan after adopting a healthy lifestyle since Ezekiel was born.

In a candid Instagram post, the star showcased her four-week progress with side-by-side images of herself at the start of her fitness programme and her current appearance.

'Truly enjoying this plan!! The food is delicious and I’m starting to workout with @steve.ahern & move more which I know is helping me feel good and keep me healthy.
