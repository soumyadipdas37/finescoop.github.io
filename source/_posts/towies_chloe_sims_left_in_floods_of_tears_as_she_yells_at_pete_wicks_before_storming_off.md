Things took an emotional turn during Wednesday night's TOWIE as Chloe Sims broke down in tears during an emotional row with Pete Wicks.

Chloe, 37, was left unable to control her emotions as she came face-to-face with the long-haired hunk, 31, as they attempted to repair their fractured friendship.

And the situation spiraled out of control as Chloe ended up screaming at her pal in anger and frustration before storming off in tears. 

Emotional: Things took an emotional turn during Wednesday night's TOWIE as Chloe Sims broke down in tears during an emotional row with Pete Wicks

The drama started as the pair sat down to discuss what happened between them after falling out in January and not speaking for eight months.

Kicking things off, Peter said: 'I didn't really get a chance to speak to you over the weekend.'

Keen to get things off her chest, Chloe then retorted: 'I was expecting that the communication would be there, the effort would be there, but on your part it was f**k all.' 

Trying to soothe his long-time pal, Pete added: 'I wanna be your mate and I wanna be in your life, and I will do whatever you want to make it better.'

'But you've come open here and opened the can of worms', Chloe replied. 'I'm open to us being in each other's lives but I'm not gonna chase you around Brentwood, I'm not gonna initiate conversations or plans or spending time together.'

The mother-of-one then became very teary as she emotionally added: 'The person that has been in my life all these years would have died for me, I trusted you with my whole heart - above everyone.' 

As Pete attempted to console her, Chloe snapped: 'You don't listen, you think everything's funny and it's not. For six months it was really hard making myself hate you. 

'You knew I'd be scared in the pandemic, you knew I'd be overthinking it. I wasn't sleeping.'

With the tears continuing to fall, she went on: 'You didn't do nothing, you were meant to be there. You promised. You do wanna, you don't. It's too heavy, I can't deal with it!

'I'm sick of it, I'm sick of men, my so-called friends f**king me over!'

Unable to continue their conversation, a teary Chloe said 'I wanna go', before walking out and leaving Pete alone. 

The pair later met up for another attempt at fixing things between them but like their last meeting, this union didn't go well either.

Addressing Pete while hinting at something more than just friendship, Chloe said: 'Well I know that I do make it clear I do like you, but for me to not speak to you, blank your calls and have a meltdown in a restaurant, that is quite big Pete.

'All I think is you don't give a s**t about me… this friendship is f**ked and if you don't do something soon or say something then that is that.'

She continued: 'Everyone has their breaking point everyone needs someone, you made out you were going to be that someone in my life. I can't deal with it.'

While an exasperated Pete responded: 'It might be too late now but I do need you.'

It has recently been claimed that Chloe and Pete were secret lovers but fell out when things got messy.

The reality stars, who fell out at the beginning of the year, are said to have struggled with putting a label on their feelings for each other. 

A source told The Sun On Sunday: 'They crossed the line from friendship to romance and it got messy. 

'After a string of failed relationships on the show, the last thing Chloe wanted was another guy letting her down publicly, but Pete was never clear about his intentions.'

The source added that Chloe felt 'slighted' by Pete's behaviour and this has caused the tension in their long-term friendship.
