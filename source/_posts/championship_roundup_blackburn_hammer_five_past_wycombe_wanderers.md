Tony Mowbray praised 'single-minded' Adam Armstrong after he netted a hat-trick. Tyrhys Dolan also scored in his his first league start, before Derrick William added another.

Wycombe were reduced to 10 men following Darius Charles' dismissal, and their manager Gareth Ainsworth called it 'a bit of a lesson.'

Furious Sabri Lamouchi hammered his Nottingham Forest players after they crashed at home to Cardiff.

Blackburn Rovers hammered five past Wycombe Wanderers in a fruitful outing at Ewood Park

Rovers gave the Championship newcomers a rude awakening with a clinical performance

Forest have now gone eight league games without a win after Kieffer Moore's double helped Neil Harris's side to victory.

Lamouchi said: 'We started the game in absolutely the wrong way. It is just unacceptable to start the game like that, by winning absolutely no duels.

'We conceded a goal from the first corner. We had worked all week on dealing with long throw-ins, second balls and corners. Our marking was absolutely unacceptable.

'We conceded the second goal the first time they launched a long throw into the box. You can work all week, but if you are not focused and determined, when it comes to defending those things, you do not have a chance.

Nottingham Forest manager Sabri Lamouchi was furious with his side's latest defeat

'The second half was much better, because we did not play in the first half. But we have to do more. We have to be more solid, more strong.

'We were so soft, we made it so easy for the opponent. We need to find a solution to get out of this difficult situation.'

Cardiff boss Harris said: 'The team showed a great response to a little bit of criticism as we hadn't started the season very well. I thought the focus, the mentality, on and off the pitch, it came to fruition here, especially in the first half.' 

Philip Cocu admitted the pressure was already on his Derby side after their defeat at Luton.

'It's the second game, but the pressure's on now as we don't have any points,' the Dutchman said.

Jordan Clark scored the late winner to make it two wins from two games for Luton in the Championship.

Luke Berry put the home in front midway through the first half, volleying in a fantastic Elliot Lee delivery.

Derby were soon level after the restart through Jack Marriott.

Luton boss Nathan Jones said: 'I'm delighted. I thought we were excellent, we really caused them problems pressing at the right times.'  

Swansea first team coach Alan Tate could yet face Football Association action for grabbing Birmingham midfielder Jon Toral by the throat at the Liberty Stadium.

'I didn't see anything because I was in the tunnel,' said Birmingham boss Aitor Karanka. 'I told the players to forget what happened.'

Swansea head coach Steve Cooper said: 'No dramas.' 

Wednesday manager Garry Monk seemed satisfied with a point against Watford, despite Josh Windass and Dominic Iorfa spurning presentable opportunities for his side.

'We had the better of the first half and they had slightly the better of the second half,' he said. Watford head coach Vladimir Ivic agreed it was a fair result. 

'First half, we didn't play well,' he said.  

New Reading manager Veljko Paunovic urged his team to 'stay humble' as they went to the top of the table after two games. 

Sheffield Wednesday were left to rue wasted chances against newly-relegated Watford

Barnsley lost Polish defender Michal Helik to a red card, before Reading went ahead through subtitute Yakou Meite.

Mads Andersen, Barnsley's other centre back, was also sent off, before Michael Olise made it safe for Reading.

An opportunistic goal from Jed Wallace sealed the points for Millwall as he snapped up the game's big chance.  

Wallace seized on a mistake by Michael Ihiekwe, who let a through-ball slide under his foot, before rounding Jamal Blackman and tapping home into an empty net.

Millwall manager Gary Rowett said: 'We got a little bit of fortune with the goal.'

Norwich manager Daniel Farke paid tribute to his side's small group of fans at Carrow Road.

'It certainly felt that there were more than 1,000 fans here, that's for sure,' said the City boss. 'Having supporters helped us a lot.'

After going behind to an early Scott Sinclair penalty, Norwich levelled when Teemu Pukki netted his first goal from open play since the tail end of last year.

Preston again got their noses in front when defender Darnell Fisher netted just but Norwich refused to lie down and made sure they went away with a point when substitute Przemslaw Placheta fired home a second equaliser.
