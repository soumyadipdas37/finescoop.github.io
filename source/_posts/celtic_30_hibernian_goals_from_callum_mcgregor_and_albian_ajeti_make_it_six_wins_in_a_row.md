Celtic made it six wins in a row after taking a 2-0 victory over Hibs to close the gap to league leaders Rangers back to one-point.

Callum McGregor opened the scoring after just seven minutes when his drilled strike found the bottom corner to give the hosts the best possible start.

Celtic doubled the lead when Hibs goalkeeper Ofir Marciano made a smart save to stop Mohamed Elyounoussi but Albian Ajeti made no mistake as he tucked home the rebound.

Elyounoussi then got a third late on as he slotted it between the keeper's legs after he was found by David Turnbull.
