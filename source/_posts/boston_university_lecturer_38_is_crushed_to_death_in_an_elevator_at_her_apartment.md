The woman who was crushed to death at her new apartment building in an elevator accident has been identified as a lecturer at Boston University.

Police said they were called to 1140 Commonwealth Avenue just after 5pm. 

Authorities said O'Connor was found in the elevator on the first floor. She was pronounced dead at the scene. 

The woman who was crushed to death at her new apartment building in an elevator accident has been identified as Boston University lecturer, Carrie O'Connor (pictured). She was 38 years old 

 O'Connor died on Monday evening when the elevator in the Allston apartment complex (pictured) suddenly dropped between floors as she tried to load her package. Police said they were called to 1140 Commonwealth Avenue just after 5pm

Authorities (pictured exciting the building) said O'Connor was found in the elevator on the first floor. She was pronounced dead at the scene

O'Connor was a French lecturer at Boston University. According to her biography on the university's website, she has taught 'a wide range of courses throughout her career, including French language, French for Business, Conversational French, French literature in translation, and French culture through gastronomy'.

She previously taught at Bentley University, Louisiana State University, MIT, Northeastern University, and Tufts University.

A DailyMail.com request for comment to Boston University was not immediately returned.

An unidentified witness told Boston 25 News that she 'heard just an ungodly scream'.

'We ran into the hallway and saw a gentlemen who was in distress screaming and hyperventilating and saying she's dead, she's dead'.

The building's residents weren't allowed inside for about 90 minutes as police worked the scene and were told that the elevator was stuck between the first floor and the basement.   

Management of the building said the elevator was inspected within the past year 

In a statement, a spokesperson from the state's Division of Professional Licensure said officials from the Office of Public Safety and Inspections determined that the elevator was recently inspected and certified in accordance with state regulations

Eric Carmichael told CBS that his wife was on the first floor when the accident occurred. 

He said she told him that it all happened so fast and there was nothing she could do to help.   

'The lady was trying to put her package into the elevator, like that's how we do it. Take it from the lobby,' Carmichael told the station. 

'I guess maybe the package and the woman were over the limit of what the elevator could handle so then what my wife said she saw was the lady's arms like hanging onto her package.'

Carmichael called the accident terrifying because any it could have been any of the residents inside when the elevator malfunctioned.  

'Terrible old elevator that should have been probably kept up better,' he added.

The elevator became stuck between the first floor and the basement, which is where the washers and dryers are in the building 

The building (pictured) itself dates back to 1920, according to tax records, but it's unclear when the elevator was installed. Police said an autopsy will be conduced to determine how the victim died

Another resident told CBS that the elevator is an old system. 

'It's a two-slide door system and unless that door is completely shut, it does not move ever,' Nevada Foskit said. 'If something did happen, it clearly had to be faulty.'

Management of the building said the elevator was inspected within the past year. 

According to WCVB, Boston's Inspectional Service Department said the elevator is overseen by the state. 

In a statement, a spokesperson from the state's Division of Professional Licensure said officials from the Office of Public Safety and Inspections determined that the elevator was recently inspected and certified in accordance with state regulations.

'The department extends its deepest sympathies to the loved ones of the victim during this difficult time,' the statement reads.

Police and officials from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are still investigating. 

The building itself dates back to 1920, according to tax records, but it's unclear when the elevator was installed. 

Police said an autopsy will be conducted to determine how the victim died.
