Matt Lucas has revealed that he's 'put on a lot of weight' after trying the delicious treats made by contestants on the Great British Bake Off.

The comedian, 46, joined the show this year as a host and replacement for Sandi Toksvig and is set to make his debut on TV screens on September 22.

Speaking ahead of the show returning, Matt has said he was very nervous going into filming and only got two hours sleep ahead of his first day, reports The Mirror. 

Oh dear! Matt Lucas has revealed he's 'put on a lot of weight' after trying the delicious treats made by contestants during his debut series as a host on the Great British Bake Off

Despite being worried to start with, the Little Britain star soon got into the swing of things and credited his co-stars with helping him settle in.

He said: 'I had the best six weeks, it was scary being the new kid, but Noel, Prue [Leith] and Paul [Hollywood] were so welcoming kinds and happy to play.'

Matt also told Waitrose Magazine that when filming started he tried a bit of each of the 12 bakers' goods, but then had to go a few days without tasting anything.

However he said: 'In the last four or five episodes, I started trying things again. I did put on a lot of weight. In the last couple of episodes I can't fit on the screen!' 

New challenge: The comedian also said he was so nervous ahead of filming the first episode that he only got two hours sleep, adding that it was 'scary being the new kid'

Speaking about his nerves ahead of the show, Matt said it was a different kind of job for him as he's usually given a script with lines to learn.

However on Bake Off he just had to be himself, something which he wasn't used to doing when the cameras were rolling.

He said: 'Some bakers are really chatty and others... sometimes you talk to them and they are really focused on the bake. You think Oh God! I'm irritating. I wasn't sure if it would be something I would be good at'.

It comes after the full line-up of bakers competing in the eleventh season of The Great British Bake Off was revealed.

Having fun: Despite his initial concerns, Matt said he was soon laughing with his supportive co-host Noel Fielding

The new batch of hopefuls are as diverse as ever and include a pantomime producer, a radiographer, an armoured guard, and an amputee who uses baking as a form of therapy.

This year's edition will see Matt make his debut as he replaces Sandi to host alongside comedian Noel Fielding and judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith.

The upcoming series took place at a private location in Essex after five years of filming at Welford Park in Berkshire.

Let's bake! Channel 4 recently unveiled the 12 home-bakers competing in the eleventh season of The Great British Bake Off,  due to hit screens next Tuesday (L-R: Hermine, Sura, Rowan, Marc, Laura, Linda, Makbul, Dave, Loriea, Lottie, Mark and Peter)

All the cast and crew members had to undergo regular COVID-19 testing in an isolation bubble amid the pandemic. 

Producers said they drew up a list of safety rules 'longer than the Bible' before filming started in Essex. Executive producer Letty Kavanagh insisted even packets of flour were cleaned several times.

And Before entering the 'biosphere', the contestants had to quarantine for nine days and then give two negative results from coronavirus tests. 

They were tested again at the venue. Anything coming in and out of the Bake Off bubble, including luggage and food deliveries, had to be deep-cleaned.
