She recently made a comeback to This Morning following a well-deserved two-month break.

And despite returning to the grind, Holly Willoughby managed to find time to meet up with her pals Emma Bunton and Nicole Appleton for the first time since lockdown restrictions eased on Thursday.

In a snap shared to Baby Spice's Instagram, the presenter, 39, the singer, 44, and the All Saints star, 45, appeared in great spirits as they toasted to the occasion with margaritas.

The group were also joined by their friends Shiarra Bell and Niki de Metz as they caught up over drinks and snacks. 

Musician Emma captioned the picture: 'My girls!!!! It’s been a long time and it was amazing to catch up. #bffs❤️ #margaritas #laughingoutloud ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.' (sic)

Like the rest of the nation, the media personalities have been keeping in contact over technology, with broadcaster Holly uploading an image of their Zoom call back in May.

Earlier in the day, Holly lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections.

Talking on Thursday's This Morning, the host asked whether she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, or father Terry, on Christmas due to having a family of five. 

On Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'.

Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. 

Holly has three children - Harry, 11, Belle, nine, and Chester, five - with husband Dan Baldwin, meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'. 

Discussing the new restrictions with Matthew Wright on This Morning, the ITV star said: 'A lot of people are thinking, "What will this mean for Christmas? What will Christmas look like?"

'It's going to be very awkward in my house as I'm a family-of-five, so I'll have to choose between my mum and dad on Christmas day!'

To which Matthew, 55, replied: 'I'm feeling very confused and conflicted. The rules are different everywhere else in the United Kingdom. 

'You can't have your parents over on Christmas Day but you can go on public transport? For the life of me, I can't make any sense of it.'

With former Celebrity Juice captain adding: 'I guess the other thought is how is anyone going to police these rules. The government are going to have marshals to monitor people.' 

Boris Johnson said groups of more than six people would be banned from meeting, in what he called a 'rule of six'.

He said: 'I wish that we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives.

'I will be absolutely clear. This is not, these measures are not, another national lockdown. The whole point is to avoid a second national lockdown.'

The new rules will be enforced in England and will apply to indoor and outdoor gatherings, including homes, parks, pubs and restaurants.     

Fines: Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200 (Holly's husband Dan pictured with their three children)
