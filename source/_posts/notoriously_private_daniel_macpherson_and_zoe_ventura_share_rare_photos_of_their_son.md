First-time parents Daniel MacPherson and Zoe Ventura kept the arrival of their son very private.

They hid Austin Xavier away from the public eye for an entire six months - but as he gets older, the couple are easing their grips.

On Thursday, both actors offered a rare glimpse into Austin's life, sharing pictures to Instagram of their beloved child.

Sweet: On Thursday, notoriously private actors Daniel MacPherson and Zoe Ventura shared rare photos to Instagram of their son, Austin Xavier, as he turned 10 months old. Pictured: Daniel's post, which showed Austin lying on a children's rug and surrounded by books and toys

Their posts were in celebration of their little boy turning 10 months old.

'10 months today. What an honour it is to be your father,' Dan, 40, captioned his photo of Austin lying on his stomach, while spread out on a children's rug and surrounded by books and toys.

The boy appeared to be reading a book - which several fans remarked upon in the comments section - and his face remained hidden.

Zoe, 39, shared a similar post marking her son's 10-month milestone, and also chose to keep Austin's face concealed for privacy reasons.

Her photo showed Austin happily sitting in a pram as she pushed him along.

Zoe's post attracted comments from her celebrity friends. 'Play date soon!' actor Jake Ryan wrote, while Sunrise newsreader Edwina Bartholomew added: 'Hello pal.'

It is the second time Daniel and Zoe have shared pictures of their son on social media since his birth last December.

On August 25, Daniel shared two pictures of himself cradling Austin in his arms. 

'My Little King,' he wrote in the caption.

The former Neighbours star was shown looking at the camera with a dummy positioned in his mouth back to front.

Austin's head was nestled into Daniel's neck in both photos, and the second one showed the father closing his eyes and enjoying the moment. 

Zoe, his wife of five years, had previously shared a picture of herself and her son taking a stroll on July 18.

'Two pom poms are better than one. Morning walks with my [heart emoji],' she captioned her Instagram post.
