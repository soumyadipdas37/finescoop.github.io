He's best known for his blink-and-you'll-miss-it romance with Love Island co-star Ellie Brown, while she enjoyed fame on the '90s classic game show Wheel Of Fortune.

And Charlie Brake, 25, and Jenny Powell, 52, were the focus of countless questions on Friday evening, when the unlikely duo partied together at a London soirée.

As the pair mingled with guests at the exclusive bash, where guests' cocktails included a CBD-infused gin, Charlie shared a snap on Instagram of them posing together – prompting fans to ask if she's his new girlfriend or mother.

In the snap in question, Charlie was seen donning a blue shirt as he posed alongside Jenny, who looked caught the eye in a fun and flirty pink floral dress.

Both of them held their large decorated gin glasses aloft as they stood by the bar at London's Gray's & Feather while toasting the new Silent Pool libations. 

And while some of Charlie's followers congratulated him, after mistakenly assuming Jenny was his girlfriend, others guessed that he'd hit the party circuit with his parent.

Questions: Some fans asked if '90s TV icon Jenny was his mother, while others assumed the brunette beauty was his new girlfriend

'Is that his mum,' asked one follower, while another echoed that sentiment as they stated: 'Thought that was his mam.'

On the other end of the assumption spectrum, another follower remarked: 'The romance we never thought we needed until now.'

'Your new bird,' said a fan, while another man branded the multi-millionaire reality star a 'lucky lucky man'. 

Even his fellow Love Island stars got in on the action, with Charlie Frederick urging: 'Go on then,' while Jordan Adefay joked that he'd 'pulled'.

Several other fans immediately recognised the woman posing alongside Charlie to be the beloved TV personality. 

With the pair's meeting apparently having left an impression, Jenny shared the snap of herself with Charlie twice on her Instagram Stories.

'Afternoon tea? Or is that G&T?!!,' Jenny captioned one upload, followed by another, which included the added text: 'Afternoon G&T with... what's his name again?'

However, fans hoping for a hot new showbiz romance are set to be disappointed, as Jenny is engaged to a man, publicly known only as Martin.

She divorced her ex-husband Toby Baxendale in 2009 after a three-year marriage. They share daughters Constance, 19, and Pollyanna, 11.

Last year, Jenny spoke with Kate Thornton, during an appearance on the White Wine Question Time podcast, about meeting Martin by chance in 2016.

She recalled: 'I was in Pret a Manger at Euston waiting to get the train back up to Manchester and this Adonis walks in, I thought, "Bloody hell, he’s alright".

'And I just put my head down because I was ogling him, and this shadow loomed over me and it was him asking if he could sit down.' 

She added: 'He was chatting away and he said, "Do you want my number?" And I said "What for?" I mean, what girl says that to a fit bloke?

'He went, "Well, you obviously haven’t been dating very much because now, in this day and age, I don’t put any pressure on you; I’ll give you the option. I will give you the number, then you can walk away and then you can think about it." 

'So I grabbed the number off him. I texted him saying: "I'm a mature woman, I don’t play games. My name’s Jenny. This is me. This is my number. Whatever." He rang that night, and asked if he could take me out to dinner.'

After rising to fame on '80s TV show No Limits, Jenny appeared on Wheel Of Fortune alongside both Nicky Campbell and John Leslie from 1995 until 2001.
