A teenager who was allegedly shot dead by his father alongside his high-school sweetheart has been farewelled in a moving funeral service.

Lukasz Kłosowski and his girlfriend Chelsea Ireland, both aged 19, were allegedly gunned down at a remote farm in Mount McIntyre in South Australia's south-east in late August.

Mr Kłosowski's 46-year-old father, Pawel Kłosowski, has been charged over their deaths.

A funeral was held for Mr Kłosowski on Thursday at the Church of the Resurrection in Unley

On Thursday, the 19-year-old was farewelled by family and friends at the Church of the Resurrection in Unley, and was described as a 'beautiful soul', Nine News reported. 

'I'll never forget him, the sense of humour, the kindness, the family style, all that was represented,' one mourner said.

'He was a beautiful soul.'

Mr Kłosowski was an aspiring journalist who studied at the University of South Australia.

He had also attended Adelaide's Christian Brothers College during high-school.  

The college issued a statement for the former student saying it was devastated 'to learn of the tragic passing of an old scholar'.

'Students from the class of 2018 have rallied together to support each other as they grieve over the loss of their 'brother',' it said.

Lukasz was studying journalism at the University of South Australia before he was killed

Ms Ireland and Mr Kłosowski dated for several years and had travelled the world together

'Our thoughts and prayers go to his family and friends.'

His girlfriend's funeral will be held on Friday.

The pair had dated for several years and travelled the world together.

Ms Ireland's sister Maddie paid tribute to the young couple online. 

You two should both still be here,' she wrote.

'Lukasz, the brother I always wanted, thank you for never failing to make me smile and laugh.' 

'I want to do you both proud.'

The teenager had volunteered at Puddle Jumpers Incorporated, a group that cares for vulnerable children and young people.  

Puddle Jumpers issued a statement following the tragic shooting, saying it was saddened by the news Ms Ireland's life was cut short.

'Chelsea, a beautiful kind-hearted volunteer, you will be very much missed by all,' the statement said. 

Her family has asked for donations for Puddle Jumpers at her funeral instead of flowers.

Pawel Kłosowski did not apply for bail and will appear at court again in December.  

Ms Ireland had led a selfless life volunteering for charity organisations like Puddle Jumpers which helps vulnerable children and young people
