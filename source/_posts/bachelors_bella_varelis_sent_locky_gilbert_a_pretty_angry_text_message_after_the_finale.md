Bella Varelis had her heart shattered by Locky Gilbert in one of the most dramatic Bachelor finales to ever play out on the TV screens. 

And now the brunette beauty has revealed she poured her heart out to her ex in a 'pretty angry' text message just days after last week's show aired. 

On Monday, the 25-year-old marketing manager told former Bachelor stars, Laura Byrne and Brittany Hockley, that Locky had not contacted her after the show aired. 

'It was a pretty angry text': Bachelor runner up Bella Varelis has revealed she sent her ex Locky Gilbert a 'pretty angry' text message two days after the finale

She surprised the girls on their podcast  Life Uncut by telling them she decided she text him instead. 

'I've sent him a message, I haven't told anyone that,' she explained. 

'I did send him a message after just to be like, I mean, it was like two days after, I was devastated, I was shattered, I was upset, I was angry. 

'It was a pretty angry text, to be honest.

'I did send him a message after just to be like, I mean, it was like two days after, I was devastated, I was shattered, I was upset, I was angry,' she said on  Laura Byrne and Brittany Hockley's podcast Life Uncut 

'The first part was like I feel like I've lost my best friend not just my boyfriend. It was a relationship for me.'

Elsewhere during the podcast, Bella revealed she is no longer 'in love' with Locky, but she has emotional 'moments' about him.

'Obviously... there are moments, when I thought on Friday  "I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine". Go to dinner with the girlfriends, had champagne and three minutes later I was bawling my eyes out,' she said. 

'The first part was like I feel like I've lost my best friend not just my boyfriend. It was a relationship for me': Bella revealed the emotional words she told Locky 

'I don't understand because I'm not in love with him anymore. I think I just genuinely thought he was in love with me and I think watching it back was a lot.

'It still hurts, obviously, because it just happened. This is my first Monday of the first week. I feel like I'm finally free.'

Bella then reiterated: 'No, I'm not in love with him anymore. It's like I wish I could just erase it from my memory and wish it never happened. But that's not going to happen.'

During last Thursday's Bachelor finale, audiences saw Locky declare his love for both Bella and Irena Srbinovska.

But he ended up choosing Irena.  

He told the Melbourne-based nurse: 'When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.'

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'
