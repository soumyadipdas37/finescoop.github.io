Studio 10's drastic new makeover has extended to the show's only remaining original host, Sarah Harris.

The 39-year-old TV journalist has appeared onscreen in a variety of fun and flirty fashion ensembles since the recent departures of her former co-hosts amid budget cuts.

On Wednesday, Sarah appeared on the Network 10 show in a magenta-coloured denim mini-dress, which featured a figure-hugging miniskirt and blouson sleeves.

The '80s-inspired ensemble was complimented by Sarah's new haircut, with flattering layers framing her face and lighter highlights.

Her fresh new style is a departure from her old wardrobe on the show, which was predominantly made up of high necklines and demure dress lengths.

The TV star has traded her business-inspired wardrobe for more youthful ensembles, and seems to be loving her new look.

Legging it: Late last month, she shared a flirty photo of herself in a white mini shirtdress on Instagram and jokingly captioned it: 'That awkward moment when you forget to wear pants to work'

Sarah's dramatic new makeover comes on the back of the show's biggest cast shake-up so far.

In August, it was revealed regular Studio 10 panelists Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling had been axed from Network 10 amid budget cuts.

Less than a month later, fellow Studio 10 panelist Joe Hildebrand announced his resignation after reported pay negotiations.   

'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role,' the 44-year-old journalist announced on-air.

'I just thought, it's probably just better to draw a line under this amazing little story that I've been lucky enough to be a part of.'

Just days later, it was announced that Dancing With the Stars judge Tristan MacManus would be joining Sarah as co-host.
