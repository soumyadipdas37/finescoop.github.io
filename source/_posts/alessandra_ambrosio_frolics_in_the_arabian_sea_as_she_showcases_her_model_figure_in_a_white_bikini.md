She has been enjoying a luxurious family vacation at the Waldorf Astoria in the Maldives. 

And Alessandra Ambrosio has some fun in the Arabian sea as she soaked up the sun on her getaway. 

The former Victoria's Secret Angel, 39, showed off her sensational figure in a white bikini from her swimsuit brand GAL Floripa.

She kicked through the water in the Wave Bikini Milky Way set, that retails for $196, from her brand. 

The bikini top features a twisted padded bandeau style, and thick crossed straps. 

While the bottoms sat high on her hips and lowered into a v-shape in the front, with a cheeky but in the back. 

The mother-of-two added a green beaded necklace and a long gold chain to her look.

She shielded her eyes from the sun in thin brown lenses sunglasses, as her golden blonde and brown hair flowed in the breeze.  

The model flew to the Maldives last month with her two children and boyfriend of two years, Italian businessman Nicolo Oddi. 

Alessandra shares her kids, Anja, 12 and Noah, 8 with her ex-fiance Jamie Mazur whom she split from after 10 years though he was not present on the dream trip.

In addition to having a luxurious family vacation, Alessandra and her family were there to celebrate her daughter Anja who turned 12 on August 24.

The whole extended Ambrosio family was invited to relax and celebrate, as her parents Lucilda and Luiz were in attendance as well as her cousins.  

The veteran model paid tribute to her 'ray of sunshine' with a series of posts and documented the celebratory family outing on her social media.  

Before jetting to the Maldives, Alessandra and her family had been locked down in their Santa Monica, California home.

Last week the swimsuit designer was seen getting a COVID test with her daughter ahead of their international travels to make sure everything was copacetic before departing. 

With the modeling industry slowly starting to ramp up again Alesandra will no doubt be back to work soon though she has been loving being at home with her family.

In the meantime she has found ways to get creative with her career and swimsuit line, as she has been modeling her latest designs from the comfort of her own home.
