Rosie Jacobs, the ex-wife of former Today show weatherman Steve Jacobs, has revealed she has been undergoing a secret health battle. 

Rosie, 41, told News.com.au that she decided to trim her brunette locks after she contracted dengue fever while living in Vanuatu with her family.

'When I was living in Vanuatu, I unfortunately contracted dengue fever, which is something that is similar to malaria. It's a mosquito-born virus that's really common in tropical environments,' she began.

Revealed! Rose Jacobs, the ex-wife of former Today show weatherman Steve Jacobs, has revealed the private health battle behind her drastic makeover which saw her swap her brunette locks (left, in February 2015) for a short, Pixie cut (right, in May 2020)

'The reason I cut my hair initially was that I actually had a health situation which most people don't know about,' the mother-of-two explained. 

Rose explained it was much easier to maintain shorter locks and feel comfortable amid Vanuatu's soaring temperatures.

'I was extremely unwell for a period of time,' she said.

The former Channel 10 star relocated from Sydney to Vanuatu in 2017 with her then-husband Steve, in a 'last-ditch' attempt to work on their marriage.

It comes just days after Rosie announced that she had landed a corporate hosting gig with Adviser Ratings, a company that helps people find qualified financial advice.

She shared a photo to Instagram of herself presenting the Together Australia web series, and told her followers she was 'beyond delighted' to be in front of the camera again after a long hiatus.

'When I was living in Vanuatu, I unfortunately contracted dengue fever, which is something that is similar to malaria. It's a mosquito-born virus that's really common in tropical environments,' she said 

Rosie looks very different these days compared to just a few years ago when she was married to Steve, the affable 53-year-old weatherman who worked for Nine's Today show from 2005 to 2019.

While she cut her hair short a while ago, her decision to change colour appears to be a fairly recent one.

Rosie started her career as a television producer, but is perhaps best known for hosting a variety of shows on Nine, 10, Foxtel and The Weather Channel.

However, she has largely stayed away from the spotlight since being made redundant from Ten Eyewitness News (now 10 News First) in 2014.
