Allison Langdon has unleashed on the American presidential election and slammed both candidates.   

The Today show host, 41, condemned Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the pair squabbled their way through the first presidential debate on Tuesday.   

Langdon clashed with co-host Karl Stefanovic, 46, on Thursday morning and even tipped Trump, the current US president, to win the election. 

'I though it was horrendous. I just watched and felt sorry for every single person in America that these are your two options to be president,' she said.

Trump and Biden repeatedly insulted and shouted over each other as Fox News moderator Chris Wallace struggled to control the 'chaotic' debate.

Langdon slammed the event for being 'more like 90 minutes of schoolboys bickering than a presidential debate'.   

Biden, former vice president to Barack Obama, even asked the president 'will you shut up, man?'.  

Langdon said she 'expected a little bit more' from Trump during the 'outrageous' debate. 

'The man who was on stage yesterday was an absolute disgrace. It's been called the worst debate ever, a dumpster fire, a train wreck. He was rude, he had no plan. 

'I found the whole thing just outrageous I though he'd be a little bit better than that, I thought he'd have the decency to at least let the other person speak,' she said. 

The Today host also slammed Biden and explained she 'didn't think he did a very good job either'.   

'Trump could very well win the election, I don't think Joe Biden won himself any fans last night,' Langdon said.

Langdon and Stefanovic also got into an on-air row while discussing the election with Harlan Hill, an advisor for Trump's campaign.    

Stefanovic addressed Hill about media coverage of the election and said 'the people who are fronting shows get very upset about Donald Trump'. 

Langdon interrupted him and explained 'I'm not defending Joe Biden here'. 

'No, I haven't finished yet,' her Stefanovic bit back.  

The pair bickered again after ending their call with Trump's campaign advisor.    

'Everyone gets fired up about it but it's America that votes... it's not got anything to do with what our opinions are or anything,' Stefanovic said. 

Langdon replied 'but it was a sad sight when the leaders of the free world...' 

'He's been sad for years,' Stefanovic interrupted. 

Langdon bit back and asked 'so therefore it's okay?' 

'I'm not saying it's okay, I'm just saying what do you expect,' her Stefanovic explained.   

'I think it's fair to expect a little more than what we got,' Langdon replied.      

The next US presidential debate will be held in Miami, Florida, on October 15.
