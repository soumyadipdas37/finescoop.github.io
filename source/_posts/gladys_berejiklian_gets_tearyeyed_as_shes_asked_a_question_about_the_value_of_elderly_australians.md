Gladys Berejiklian delivered an emotional response when asked whether Australians should accept that elderly people will be a casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The New South Wales premier appeared lost for words after being showed a clip of ex-prime minister Tony Abbott arguing nature should be allowed to 'take its course' for more elderly victims. 

'How much is a life worth? How do you decide that as a leader?,' The Project's Carrie Bickmore asked Ms Berejiklian on Wednesday. 

'I think what distinguishes us from other places on the planet is how much we value human life and that's a positive thing,' Ms Berejiklian replied.

Ms Berejiklian was interviewed by Carrie Bickmore (pictured) and opened up about valuing human life as well as revealing her biggest regret during the coronavirus pandemic 

'I hope after this process, all of us take a good hard look at ourselves as to how we treat our elderly. 

'I think we have to improve things across the board and value human life, value the wisdom and contribution they've made,' the teary premier explained. 

Ms Berejiklian also revealed 'one of the big' regrets of her coronavirus response was posting an old photo of her dressed up in a superwoman costume. 

The premier shared the hilarious throwback photo from her 21st birthday as part of the #MeAt20 challenge in April.    

She said the picture was embarrassing but agreed it was good to 'break the mould' and show Australians a different side of their politicians. 

Ms Berejiklian also reflected on the everyday 'battle' of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and urged Australians to think about shaping the 'post-COVID' world. 

The premier said she was always concerned that NSW could follow the same path as Victoria but she had learned a lot about managing the coronavirus.

The premier (pictured) also discussed empathising with Victorian premier Daniel Andrews 

'My anxiety remains the same, if not slightly higher, because every week we have had a number of undetected or unsourced cases. 

'If you look back to Melbourne, Melbourne didn't get worse because of the number of cases they had, they had undetected community transmission which then unknowingly got to a stage where it did,' she told reporters last month. 

Ms Berejiklian said she didn't judge premier Daniel Andrews for Victoria's explosive second wave of coronavirus and empathised with his difficult circumstances. 

The premier said she felt optimistic about the future and was looking forward to a Christmas bound by far less restrictions than Easter earlier this year.

Early in the pandemic, New South Wales initially suffered the biggest number of coronavirus cases and deaths. 

At the heart of the crisis was the doomed Ruby Princess cruise ship being granted permission to offload its passengers on Sydney Harbour.  

The fateful ship arrived in Sydney on March 19 and more than 2,700 disembarked the vessel with no health checks. 

Twenty-eight people died as a result of infections from the ship and 62 people who weren't on board contracted the virus. 

Ms Berejiklian has apologised 'unreservedly' for the fiasco.

'Those circumstances should and never will happen again in New South Wales.

'We have learnt so much since those horrible mistakes,' she said.      

NSW reported 17 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday including one in hotel quarantine, 15 linked to known clusters and one where the source is unknown.
