In a snap shared to her Instagram, Pia looked every inch the bombshell as she showed off her tresses. 

Streaks of lighter tresses ran throughout her locks which were styled in beachy waves. 

Pia captioned her sultry selfie: 'The hair masters! @valonzhaircutters ❤️@stuartbane_valonz @gabbyguerrisi_valonz ❤️.'

This comes after Pia heartbreakingly said farewell to her beau Patrick as he headed back home to the US via a private jet.  

 Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, Pia and Patrick had been apart for months before reuniting in Sydney the week earlier.

Pia posted a selfie to Instagram captioned 'Two Ps in a pod' to announce they had been reunited, while also playing on the fact both of their names start with 'P'.

Among their various activities, the couple were spotted going on a romantic date to the Dolphin Hotel in Surry Hills and going on a shopping trip in the Sydney CBD.

Patrick was also played basketball with Pia's youngest son Lennox, 13, in Sydney on Tuesday.

Pia shares Lennox with her ex-husband and former AFL player, Brad. She's also mother to son Isaiah, 16, who she gave birth to when she was nineteen.
