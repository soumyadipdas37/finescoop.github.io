Kendall Jenner got a taste of nature in her latest Instagram post.

The 24-year-old model looked like she was loving the fresh air as she enjoyed a hike through the mountains.

Kendall was ready to go in her sporty one-piece, which she paired with practical hiking boots. She also carried a pair of goggles in one hand, just in case the wind decided to pick up.

Not needing much makeup, she went with a fresh-faced glow and kept her chocolate tresses hanging loose.

First Jenner shared a snap of herself in front of some pine trees with mountains and a cloudy sky in the background.

Then she got an action shot, seen steadying herself while going down a rocky trail.

Kendall wasn't afraid to get a bit dirty, also sharing a first-person look at her dust covered legs and shoes.

It was unclear where the IMG beauty was enjoying the outdoors, but she was last spotted in LA on August 23rd.

Recently Jenner has been enjoying time with new flame Devin Booker, who she was seen putting on a steamy display with in Malibu last month.

While things looked hot and heavy between the pair, Kendall and Devin aren't taking things too seriously according to sources.

'They're hooking up, but they're not serious,' a source told Us Weekly over the weekend.

It seems Booker isn't the only one Jenner may have an interest in, according to the insider who said: 'She's talking to a couple different guys. She has so many men after her it's crazy.'

Kendall and Devin were first spotted together in April and have been fueling gossip ever since. In July they appeared to go on a trip to Sedona, Arizona together, only intensifying rumors.

While Jenner's always shown a liking for basketball players - previously dating the 76ers' Ben Simmons and Pistons pro Blake Griffin - Booker's relationship history makes him an interesting choice.

Devin previously dated her sister Kylie's ex bestie Jordyn Woods, who was booted from the Kardashian/Jenner inner circle after smooching Khloe Kardashian's babydaddy Tristan Thompson, who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
