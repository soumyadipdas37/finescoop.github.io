The P.E Nation designer turned her hand to cooking, making boyfriend Michael Clarke, 39, a feast. 

The Middle Eastern inspired fast included vine leaves, kofta, dips and what appeared to be a baked avocado.

It's unclear where Pip was spending her quiet evening, but it's likely she was sharing a date night with Michael.   

Michael begun dating Pip after his separation from Kyly Clarke became public knowledge. 

Pip confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, while the pair enjoyed a Noosa holiday together.
