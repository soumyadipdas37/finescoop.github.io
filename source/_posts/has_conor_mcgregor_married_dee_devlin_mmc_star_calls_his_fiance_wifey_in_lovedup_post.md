In June, Conor stunned fans by announcing his retirement from UFC in a post on Twitter, saying shortly after his announcement that the game 'does not excite me'.

The former featherweight and lightweight champion was a controversial figure during his career, but despite this, was unquestionably Mixed Martial Art's biggest attraction.

Sportsman Conor and Dee have been in a relationship since 2008, when he started his UFC career.

They also live together with their children Conor Jr, two, and Croia, 20 months, in a stunning £2 million mansion.

Conor - whose net worth is said to be £90 million - suggested that he proposed to Dee when they were on holiday together in France.

After leaving her job to support Conor, Dee became part of his team as she was put in charge of his finances, and travels everywhere with him.
