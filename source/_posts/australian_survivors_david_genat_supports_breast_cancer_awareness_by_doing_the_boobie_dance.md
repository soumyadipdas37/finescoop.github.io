He's the self-proclaimed 'Golden God' of Australian Survivor who was crowned the winner of All-Stars' first season earlier this year.

And on Sunday, David Genat showed off his impressive party trick in an attempt to raise awareness for a good cause.

Uploading a video to his Instagram account, David, 40, put on a purple coloured bra and said: 'I've been working really hard to try and fit into this thing.

What a champ! On Sunday, Australian Survivor: All Stars winner David Genat supported breast cancer awareness by doing the 'boobie dance' for Purple Bra Day 

'Now I know there's a pandemic going on, so it's a bit hard with the fund raising, but breast cancer stops for no one.'

He continued: 'If you swipe left i'll do the boobie dance while you donate and rate me on a scale from 1-10!'

Back in March, David revealed he was planning to spend his $500,000 prize money on relocating his family from the US to Australia. 

Concerted effort: 'I've been working really hard to try and fit into this thing,' he jokingly told his followers

Speaking to news.com.au, David explained the move will help his movement coach wife Pearl Christensen, who suffers from lupus, and his daughter, who has dyslexia.

In addition to that, David will donate some money to the Fijian villages where Survivor is filmed, which do not have clean water. 

He also set a little set aside for himself, and has since purchased a $27,750 Harley-Davidson Fat Bob 114 motorcycle.

David is no stranger to taking his clothes off for a good cause.
