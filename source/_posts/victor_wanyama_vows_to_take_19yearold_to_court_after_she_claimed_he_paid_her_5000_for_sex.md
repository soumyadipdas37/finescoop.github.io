Former Tottenham midfielder Victor Wanyama has insisted he will take a 19-year-old woman to court following her claims he paid her £5,000 for sex.

During an Instagram Live interview with blogger Mandela, socialite Shakila claimed she had been paid for sex by several Kenyan celebrities, including Khaligraph Jones and Wanyama.

But Kenya captain and Montreal Impact star Wanyama has hit back by releasing a statement on Twitter furiously refuting and condemning the 'fabricated and insulting' allegations.

Wanyama, 29, said: 'My attention has been drawn to a video circulating online containing false, fabricated and insulting allegations aimed at scandalising my good name and reputation.

'I wish to distance myself completely from the contents of this defamatory video.

'The allegations made therein are a total fabrication and a figment of the maker's imagination at best. I have NEVER met any party in the video.

'I strongly condemn the actions of both the woman in the video and the publisher of the video Arthur Mandela via his Instagram account @Xtiandela for encouraging the disparagement of character of individuals based on false accusatory statements.

'The allegations made are manifestly fictitious clearly meant to boost the online audience of both the maker and of the insulting allegations and publisher of the video.'

Wanyama's statement continued: 'I have worked long and hard to build my character and standing in the society.

'Such malicious, scandalising and false assertions about my name and character are UNACCEPTABLE to me, my family and institutions who have placed great trust in me.

'I am prepared to go to great lengths to protect my good name and character.

'Consequently, and with the blessing of my management team, I have instructed my legal team to pursue ALL legal remedies available to me and to which I have the unreserved right to seek. That is all I wish to state.'

In an Instagram post, Shakila had earlier apologised to musical artist Jones for her claim.

She wrote: 'Am being forced to do this public apology cause I damaged @khaligraph_jones public image by whatever that I said yesterday due to influence of alcohol and reverse psychology.

'Papa Jones am sorry. The rest mentioned were true and any claims raised will not be taken and dealt with personally.'
