Lockdown saw many of us return to the traditional doorstep delivery – but it’s not just the daily pinta that the milkman is distributing.

A growing demand for eco-friendly products means record numbers of Britons are ordering cleaning products straight to their homes, including washing-up liquid in glass bottles.

More than a million UK households have milk delivered by a milkman, including 500,000 supplied by Milk & More, which is owned by German dairy conglomerate Muller.

The group launched its delivery of cleaning products six weeks ago and now distributes soaps, laundry detergent and washing-up liquid in reusable glass bottles. 

Many of those who have switched to the service say they have done so because of concerns about the impact of plastics on oceans, sea creatures and birds. 

Most glass bottles can be reused an average of 25 times.

Tim Moore, 45, an economist from Reading, has had milk delivered for three years and recently added cleaning products to his order.

‘My partner and I have started using the laundry detergent and fabric conditioner because we love the fact that, like our milk, they come in glass bottles that can be used over and over again,’ he said.

‘They are great quality, too.’

Milk & More operates 500 electric vehicles and the company has pledged to switch to zero-tailpipe-emission vans in cities by 2028 to help tackle air pollution and climate change.

Its products, which start at £4, are manufactured and refilled in Northamptonshire.

Deputy chief executive Andrew Kendall said: ‘Helping our customers reduce their plastic waste is something we are really passionate about.’
