Kylie Jenner made the most of the final days of summer on Wednesday, as she gave her 195 million Instagram followers a look at her leisurely afternoon by the pool. 

While basking in the sun, the 23-year-old reality star put on a very busty display in a plunging red two-piece, which showcased plenty of her sun-kissed skin. 

While keeping the camera just above her torso, the cosmetics mogul could be seen running one hand through her long brunette locks with a smoldering gaze.

As she flashed her signature pout, Jenner appeared to be keeping her accessories to a minimal, apart from a chain around her neck and a pink scrunchie on her wrist.   

Her artfully applied makeup look included a heavy swipe of blush, mascara, matt lipstick and contoured cheekbones. 

In addition to her sultry video, the mother-of-one uploaded more footage of just her incrediblely toned legs and expansive backyard.

As she sprawled out on a lounge chair under a scenic palm tree, the beauty gave fans a look at one of her lush outdoor couches and a basketball court. 

In another envy-inducing picture, she snapped a shot of her berry smoothie, which was topped with coconut flakes and mint.  

Kylie has posted a number of sexy snaps in the wake of the shocking news that the Kardashian–Jenner clan's long-running reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, would come to an end in 2021 after airing its 20th season.

Kim Kardashian shared a post announcing the series end, while her family members posted identical statements in their Insta Stories.

'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' she wrote.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.' 



Goodbye! A joint statement from the family expressed their gratitude to their fans

Although the family advertised the end of their series as a joint decision, more recent reporting suggests only a faction of the family wanted to be done with the show.

Page Six reported Saturday that the decision to pull the plug came from Kris Jenner, after both Kim and Kylie expressed a desire to leave the show.

Kylie's oldest sister Kourtney Kardashian had already quit before the most recent season, though her former partner Scott Disick and her sister Khloé Kardashian were both reportedly interested in continuing the series.

A source told The Sun: 'The family have been locked in an ongoing debate over the future of the show for months now.'
