Boris Johnson loves football. He loves it when he is trying to score political points from Russia by threatening to pull the national team out of the World Cup.

And he loves it when the over-promoted cabal of incompetents with which he surrounds himself can moralise about salaries and transfer fees to divert from their own failings and inadequacies.

Most of all, he loves its opium for the masses quality, which is why he was so keen on it being piped into homes during lockdown. 

Boris Johnson loves football when trying to score political points and divert from his failings

He’ll be relying on football to help him out of this hole, too — every match shown live — to divert from the death of the hospitality industry, the biggest casualty of this shootout in the last chance saloon, a growing crisis of this Government’s making.

That is Johnson’s public face, at least. Behind the scenes, it is rather different. Yesterday, after the latest round of measures that threaten our long-term sporting landscape, the department run by Oliver Dowden, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, was briefing that, yes, the Government would divert funds to help sport.

But not football. The point- scoring had begun. Football had enough money. The national sport, the one the Government has used as a crutch throughout this crisis, could look after itself; or, rather, the Premier League could. It was their round.

Dowden, remember, was the man who created a renewal taskforce for the various entertainment industries that featured the former chairman of the BBC and ITV, the artistic director of the English National Ballet, the chair of Arts Council England, the founder of and the chief executive of the Ambassador Theatre Group, which runs 50 venues worldwide. And looking at sport’s pressing restart and lockdown issues? Alex Scott.

The Prime Minister will be relying on football to help him out of his own Government's crisis

That’s how seriously Dowden takes sport. Unless it is grouse shooting. This Government seem very keen on grouse shooting. Maybe football clubs could heavily arm fans, release 200 grouse on the pitch and get spectators back that way. Call it a shoot, with a match attached. All perfectly legal.

Back to reality and football is better placed than most to eschew Government hand-outs. Football’s elite should help those less fortunate through this crisis, of that there is no doubt. After all, for many in the Premier League this is a moment in time.

Burnley spent all but two of 40 years outside the top division, before their current residence; and prior to winning promotion in 2017, Brighton had sustained four years in the top division in their entire history. Had Covid arrived at any given point across the last decade, or should it come back in a different form years from now, there will be another group of clubs to some extent insulated by the Premier League’s wealth.

The Football League is littered with casualties who would once have been in Brighton or Burnley’s position: Bolton and Bradford in League Two; Ipswich, Hull, Blackpool, Wigan, Charlton, Portsmouth and Sunderland in League One. It shows a contempt for history if Premier League clubs do not accept where sliding doors may have placed them right now.

Even so, the elite have lost £700million and counting, much of it to repayments and financial penalties caused by the impact of coronavirus. Forget the juxtaposition of enormous salaries at one end, furloughs and redundancies at the other. That is economic illiteracy.

Oliver Dowden said the Government would divert funds to help sport - but not football

Arsenal’s cuts did not fund Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s new contract. Wouldn’t pay his wages for more than a few months, in fact. Redundancies come because the business is suffering and it is to be hoped the captain’s deal will ease that pain by bringing success and greater revenue.

Reverse it: keep the ticket office junior and lose the best player. That would be insanity. Arsenal could cash in on Aubameyang and take on a thousand employees, but what would be their strategy?

So it is possible for clubs to invest in the transfer market, or on exceptional individuals, while still having financial concerns. That is the complexity of a football club balance sheet. And there is now little prospect of fans returning to stadiums in any number, despite a bullish statement issued by the Premier League yesterday. Arsenal’s matchday revenue accounts for close on a quarter of their budget. So in this febrile climate, Premier League clubs will be expected to fund, not just their own shortfall, but that of the entire Football League pyramid.

This was, in many ways, a condition of football’s return last season. The Premier League restart received Government backing with the proviso that they would provide assistance further down when the time came.

The Government will argue that football was warned there would be a debt to settle. Against this, Premier League clubs may counter there is no bottomless well of resources and, without footfall, they will find it increasingly hard to meet commitments on all fronts.

That was why yesterday’s statement was so uncharacteristically aggressive. It was a reminder that not every club in the Premier League is financially robust, or feeling generous. Brighton, for instance, have broken ranks and said any bailout should be conditional on the return of fans. They will not be alone in seeking leverage.

Equally, there is growing insistence on a business plan from the EFL before a rescue package is passed on. The money cannot be used to finance what has been described as a promotion arms race. The Premier League are requesting a specified schedule, and financial limitations, to ensure money is used where necessary.

Rick Parry, who in a former existence as the Premier League chief helped change the television payments that as good as created this hardship, will need to do more than ask, and hope for sympathy.

Most of all, it might be an idea if he stopped criticising the Premier League each time he is invited to Parliament. A few on the select committees should wind their necks in, too, now it is clear who must come to football’s rescue.

For other sports, it is different. Following a 4.30pm meeting between Dowden and the chief executives of leading sports, it was plain who picks up the tab for the rest. ‘We have been clear an autumn without crowds would leave us with little choice but to approach Government for financial help,’ said Bill Sweeney, chief executive officer of the RFU.

‘Unfortunately, we are now in that position. Without support we are in danger of clubs at the heart of communities across England, as well as players and volunteers, disappearing for ever.’

EFL chairman Rick Parry will need to hope for sympathy from Premier League clubs

His words will be echoed across a variety of sports, even those that do not rely on gate money. They will be deprived of vital fundraising and sponsorship contracts; and without Government aid, sport across the country will be changed irrevocably. Some of it will simply go anyway.

There really isn’t the money to centrally maintain the outlier community sports. Citizens will have to do it themselves. Yet without the gatherings that traditionally raise revenues, the dinners, the auctions, the club events, the benefactors, in some cases it will sadly not be possible. This is a harsh winter.

So, in its way, football is lucky. All the things members of Government used to shame it — the enormous broadcast deals that finance the contracts and transfers — are what will drive the bailout. It is one less task for this Government to deal with. And given their record of dealing with much else, maybe football should be grateful for that, too.
