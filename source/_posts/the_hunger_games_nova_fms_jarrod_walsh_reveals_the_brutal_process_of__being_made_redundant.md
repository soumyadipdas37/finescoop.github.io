On Tuesday, Jarrod, who was Nova Adelaide's afternoon presenter and sports anchor and at the network for 16 years, revealed the brutal process of his boning

'I've spoken to the people who kept their jobs. I know how difficult it would have been for those guys for them to reach out. It felt like the Hunger Games to be honest,' he said. 

The radio star says the staff were left were shown criteria by which the sackings were justified. 

'We had a criteria shown to us when it was presented to all the Mornings and Afternoons announcers... it was presented to us the criteria we fell short in,' he said. 

Jarrod says the station had asked him to take his 90-day annual leave, and he had not been in the station full time since April.

He added that in that time, he had prepared himself for the worst - saying that he was an 'anxious' person who always worked through the worst case scenario. 

'I've made peace with what's happened because I've been preparing for it for so long,' he said.   

Jarrod also revealed he had a personal call from NOVA's chief programming and marketing officer, Paul Jackson. 

'It was just a lovely conversation, which I don't reckon everybody would get,' he said.

Earlier this month, Jarrod reacted to news of his redundancy on social media, sharing a tearful video in which he reflected on his 16-year career at the network.

'I was part of the start of Nova 919 in Adelaide, a new radio station, a new culture… that was 16 years ago. In September 2020, I have had my last day,' he said.

'I was one of a handful of good people who was made redundant from the radio station.

 'I was preparing myself mentally… but nothing can prepare you to hear those words.'

Jarrod broke down in tears as he reminisced about his time at Nova, and admitted he was feeling a mixture of 'fear, relief and anxiety' since hearing the news.

He added: 'My hands have been randomly shaking for the past couple of days.

'I haven't really been given the opportunity to say farewell and thank you on the air so I'm going to do that here and I'm going to try and hold it together.'

Jarrod will continue to work as an MC for live sporting events around South Australia.
