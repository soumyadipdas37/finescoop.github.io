Traditionally, ice cream vans announced their presence with the tinny strains of Greensleeves and proceeded to engulf their little customers with diesel fumes.

But now you can breathe easy as you buy your 99 or lolly – thanks to the solar-powered van.

Ice cream maker David Baker said he disliked seeing fumes billowing from his stationary vans because the engine had to be on for the machinery to work.

So he fitted three of his vans with solar panels which power the freezers and ice cream machines, and keep the air clean. 

Mr Baker, 69, who runs Styles Farm near Minehead, Somerset, said: ‘We had smoke coming from the vans right in front of the children so there was a health issue, as well as a global issue. 

'Now people are very surprised when they find out that our service is powered by sunshine.’

His vans can operate for four days of 24-hour trading at music festivals in sunny weather before needing a power supply for four hours to recharge. 

Mr Baker said: ‘Through the summer, if you’ve got sun, the solar panels create enough power to run the facilities. 

'If you get a lot of cloud they don’t produce as much power, but your trade isn’t all that high either so it evens out.’
