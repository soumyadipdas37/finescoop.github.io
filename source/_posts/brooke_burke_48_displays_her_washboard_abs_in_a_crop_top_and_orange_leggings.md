It comes after Kristen stressed about the importance of self-care earlier this month. 

She told E! News: 'Make time for yourself! You're worth it! Too many women find comfort in falling last on the totem pole. Now that I'm in my 40s, I understand the value of me time and taking care of myself with zero guilt. 

'The more I take care of myself, the better I feel and the better I am in all areas of my life. I'm also raising four children, so I try leading by example regarding the value of self-care.' 

The fitness pro recently kicked off her 28-day Quaran-Tone fitness challenge, through Brooke Burke Body, sharing the details on her Instagram.
