Just months after moving into their luxurious $6.5 million Encino mansion, Dorit Kemsley and her husband PK are already shopping for a bigger space, DailyMailTV can exclusively reveal.

The 44-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star is selling her swanky modern farmhouse, located in an elite area of the Valley, and looking to turn a hefty profit on the sprawling space.

According to a source, the couple has listed their home for a whopping $9.495 million with the help of Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles realtor David Parnes.

'Dorit and PK are selling their home because they are now going to run their businesses from their house,' a source tells DailyMailTV. 

Adding: 'Their kids are also being home schooled so they are looking for a larger estate that is laid out for this new COVID world we find ourselves in.'

For help with the move, the couple is keeping things very much in the Bravo family by working with Million Dollar Listing star David Parnes.

Only the best: The RHOBH stars are working with  Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles realtor David Parnes

Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles just wrapped up season 12 at the beginning of September. 

Parnes is a luxury real estate broker at The Agency which is owned by Mauricio Umansky, the husband of fellow RHOBH star Kyle Richards.

Last year, Parnes and Harris raked in an impressive $400 million in sales - and since 2017, the duo has brought in over a billion.

While they're definitely ready to make a move, Dorit and PK haven't found the right space yet and are currently 'on the hunt to buy a new house', the insider said.

After purchasing the space in 2019, the Kemsley clan had just settled into the Encino space a few months ago, right as the pandemic really forced Los Angeles residents indoors. 

Over the summer the Beverly Beach owner took to social media to show off the stunning interior of the home, including her 'dream kitchen,' as well as the expansive outdoor space.
