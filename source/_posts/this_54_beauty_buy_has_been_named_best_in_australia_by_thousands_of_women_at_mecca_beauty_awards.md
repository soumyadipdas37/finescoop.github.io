The top-voted buy acts as a three-in-one to get the result of a powder, pencil and wax in one mechanical brow pencil that's small enough to fit in bags.

According to the product description, it creates the 'fullness of a powder, definition of a pencil and hold of a wax' to create the perfect brow arch.

The pencil helps to imitate hair-like strokes through a triangular tip and fine edge.

The 'buildable formula' allows the individual to fill in each brow to a certain intensity, allowing both soft and full looks can be achieved.

'When defining your brows, follow the natural growth pattern of your hair. Then work the pencil against the growth of the hair to add volume to the brow,' Mecca Maxima colour specialist Eliza said online.

The product is available in nine shades from blonde to natural black and is made from vegan ingredients.

It has a brush on one end and the pencil on the other for added convenience at home and while on the go.

Online more than 1,300 happy shoppers who have previously purchased the product rated it five out of five stars.

'A repeat buy, I buy one for myself and one for my daughter. So good it lasts for the year [and] the blonde colour is perfect,' one woman said.

'I have been using this for years now. The shape and texture of the pencil is perfect and makes it easy to get lines and shape how you want them,' another said.

Customers can purchase the product in store and on the Mecca website.
