They had a falling out at the end of January and haven't spoken at all during the coronavirus pandemic.

And former close pals Chloe Sims, 37, and Pete Wicks, 30,  finally shared their first chat in eight months as they reunited during Sunday's episode of TOWIE.

In an exclusive preview shared with MailOnline, the reality stars are seen talking about their feud while standing beside some water.

Not impressed: Chloe Sims calls her former close pal Pete Wicks an 'a***hole' during their first chat after falling out eight months ago on Sunday's TOWIE episode

However things soon get a little heated as Chloe airs her grievances and explains to Pete why she's been unhappy with their friendship.

Pete kick starts the awkward conversation by asking if there's 'anything' Chloe would like to say.

She then replies: 'Not really, I don’t wanna be rude infant of Peggy [Pete's dog], but you were a bit of an a***hole. 

'Towards the end of our friendship I felt like you started dismissing my feelings and … are you going to look at me or are you going to look at the bush? 

Listening: Pete doesn't appear to be too impressed as he listens to Chloe's grievances during their awkward meet up  

'I feel like you were dismissing how I felt a lot, I've confided in you, I've told you everything and told you all my secrets... and I know I'm a lot. 

'I know i can be clingy and i can be jealous that is who i am, so if you don’t like those things then we can’t be friends cause I'm not going to change, I am who I am.'

Pete then tried to interject, telling Chloe to 'hold on, hold on', but to no avail as she continued to explain how she was feeling.

She continued: 'No, I'm getting to my point. Obviously when the pandemic happened I just thought "omg I need Pete, I need to talk to Pete"'

Having it out: Chloe accuses Pete of 'dismissing her feelings' during the confrontation 

Ultimatum: The reality star tells Pete that if he can't accept who she is, then they can't be pals again as she's 'not going to change'

Pete then asked his former close pal, 'so why didn’t ya?' with Chloe replying that she 'didn’t know if you would be there even if i did reach out'.

During the interaction Pete appears to be concentrating hard on what Chloe has to say about what went wrong between them.

Despite finally chatting about what the problem is, the pair did not reveal why they had fallen out in the clip.

It comes after the duo spoke out about their ongoing feud, admitting they have gone months without speaking to each other, on last Sunday's episode.

The mother-of-one had a socially distanced gathering with Olivia Attwood, James 'Diags' Bennewith and Liam 'Gatsby' Blackwell, where she opened up about their argument.  

She explained: 'Me and Pete stopped speaking. We had a falling out since the end of January. It wasn’t nasty, it was quite calm but I didn’t want to have people around me who aren’t 100%. I just said, "I can’t have you in my life anymore."' 

Chloe did not elaborate on what the dispute was about or why she had decided to stop speaking to Pete.

Love Island's Olivia said: 'I'm surprised he didn’t reach out to you during lockdown. He’d normally check in, especially on you, but there you go', to which Chloe replied: 'He made me question if I even knew him at all.'

Later in the episode, the bride-to-be met with Pete and took the opportunity to hear his side of the story.  

Recalling their falling out, he said: 'We had a barney and the last thing she said to me was we didn’t need to talk so, so be it.  

'We’ve been close for so many years and this was the first time we’ve disagreed and I’ve thought, "you know what she doesn’t want me in her life." It’s the longest we’ve ever gone without talking.'

Pete admitted he would like to patch things up with Chloe but he worries that their friendship was beyond repair.  

He said: 'What does worry me, if I do reach out to her and she says f**k off, it’ll hurt me. Do I want to save the friendship? Of course I do. Do I think it can be saved? No.'

Tension: Chloe and Pete admitted they had gone months without speaking to each other
