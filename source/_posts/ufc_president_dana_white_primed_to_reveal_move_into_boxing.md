UFC president Dana White has revealed that his foray into the boxing world will be detailed in the next couple of weeks. 

White has been weighing up a move into the sport for some time and the legendary MMA promoter is on the brink of a major announcement. 

He told BT Sport: 'The world of boxing hasn't been able to do what I've been able to do [in MMA] over the last 20 years.

Dana White has teased an announcement about his move into the world of boxing 

'If they can't do things when the world is normal, you can't expect them to do things when the world is crazy.

'I peeked under the hood a lot there for the last year. Looked at different things and I said, "I don't know man, I don't know if this is fixable".'

He added: 'Funnily enough, since the pandemic I've been looking at other options too.

'And we'll probably have something to announce here soon. Yeah [it is in the world of boxing].

White gave an interview outlining what he had been doing to study the boxing world 

'When it's time, I'll let you know, I'm not ready yet. But [it'll be] in the next couple of weeks.'   

I remains to be seen whether White will work with a stable of boxers or have more grand ambitions for changing the convoluted way the sport is run. 

White has been a key part of the UFC's success over the years and the growth of MMA into a legitimate sport sanctioned all over the United States.   

He orchestrated the move to Fight Island in Abu Dhabi to put on a number of huge events during the coronavirus pandemic as a grand contingency plan.   

UFC 253 on Yas Island takes place this Saturday and will be headlined by Israel Adesanya vs Paulo Costa.
