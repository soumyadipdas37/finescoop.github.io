Riley Keough was spotted watching her husband surf from the beaches of Malibu, marking the first time she's been seen since the aftermath of her brother Benjamin's death, DailyMail.com exclusive photos show. 

The mourning 31-year-old actress' new tattoo of an inscription of Benjamin's name was peeking out from under her shirt collar as she headed back to her car with husband Ben Smith-Petersen on Tuesday morning.

On Monday, Keough marked two months since his death, sharing a photo that showed the duo goofing around and pulling faces.

'Two months without you. I would give anything for 1 more minute with you little brother,' she captioned the image.

On Tuesday, Keough bundled up in a large hoodie, sweatpants with her hair tied back as she accompanied her stuntman husband to the beach, giving him a quick peck in the parking lot. 

She sat on a towel laid out on the sand as she listened to music and watched him surf. 

Keough tied her hoodie around her waist while walking back to the car with Australian-born Smith-Petersen, who she married in 2015.

On her collarbone was the recent tattoo she got to honor Benjamin - inscribed with his name 'Benjamin Storm'. Benjamin had her name tattooed in the same spot. 

Benjamin's family and girlfriend Diana Pinto have been devastated by his death, with both Keough and Pinto regularly posting tributes to him on their social media pages. 

Keough previously shared a slideshow of images of the pair - who are both the children of Lisa Marie Presley and Danny Keough - on Instagram, and said she 'can't believe' her sibling is gone.

She wrote alongside the pictures: 'Mornings are the hardest. I forget you're gone. I can't cry because of the fear that I will never stop. A pain that's new to me. 

'You. There are no words for you. Angel is the closest I could think of. Pure light. Baby brother. Best friend. Wild man. Intellectual. Witness to my life. Twin soul. Protector.

'Too sensitive for this harsh world. I hope you give me strength to endure the giant hole you've left in my heart. I hope you give me the strength to eat. I hope you're cradled in love. I hope you feel my love. I hope you feel god. You are god. 

'I can't believe you've left me. Not you sweet Ben Ben. Anyone but you. I guess this is true heartbreak. I hope we meet again. (sic)'

His passing was officially ruled a suicide, with the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner confirming he died from a self-inflicted 'intraoral shotgun wound'. 

Following Benjamin's death, a spokesperson for Lisa Marie - who has 11-year-old twins Finley and Harper with her fourth husband Michael Lockwood - said: 'She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11 year old twins and her oldest daughter Riley. 

'She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.'

Lisa Marie, 52, reportedly has no plans on returning to the $1.8 million home where Benjamin shot himself, finding a new place to stay after initially staying at a hotel in Beverly Hills in the days after his death.  

His grandmother Priscilla Presley, 75, who was married to Elvis Presley from 1967 to 1973, gave an emotional statement to fans shortly after his death via her official Facebook page.

'These are some of the darkest days of my family's life,' the statement began. 'The shock of losing Ben has been devastating. Trying to put all the pieces together of all the possible whys has penetrated my soul. 

'Each day I wake up I pray it will get better. Then, I think of my daughter and the pain she is going through as she was a doting mother. Ben's father, Danny, who is completely lost, as Ben was his only son.  

'Riley, so loving and so close to him; Harper and Finley, who absolutely adored Ben. Navarone, who struggles deeply with loss and death. Rest In Peace Ben, you were loved,' the statement concluded.
