Alex Beresford was tasked with climbing the mast of a ship at Portsmouth's Historic Dockyard, in scenes set to air in ITV's All Around Britain on Sunday.

The TV presenter, 39, looked shaky as he scaled the mast of HMS Warrior with the help of a professional sailor in an exclusive clip from the show.

Trying not to let the height get to him, Alex jokingly asked if it was 'too late for a wee' before he prepared to go up the mast.

As he began walking up, Alex said partway: 'This feels high already, Andy we might not be going to the top.' 

But Andy only had words of encouragement as he said Alex just needed to go 'nice and steady' before reassuring him it was easier climbing down than it was going up.

The presenter slowly made his way up the mast, being careful not to slip, claiming the cameramen would 'speed it up in post.'

Every week, the Good Morning Britain hosts will present the show from some of the country’s most popular attractions and famous landmarks and discover their lesser-known stories. 

Last week, Alex and Ranvir Singh got to grips with koalas and anteaters at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire in their new ITV series for the first episode.

They joined keepers to feed the koalas, sea lions and giraffes.

The duo rolled up their sleeves to help prepare food for the park's twelve hundred residents, including mixing an insect porridge to feed a hungry anteater, which included plenty of mealworms and termites. 

Alex told MailOnline: 'We had a fun day filming the first episode of the new series at Longleat earlier this week. We met some koalas and fed the anteaters. 

'I did have one moment of horror where I spilt some of the anteater porridge down my top. That was pretty disgusting.

'It had meal worms, bugs and fruit in it. Ranvir also fed some hungry giraffes and it was amazing to meet some of the animals.

'Our new show kicks off on Sunday on ITV at 11.20am and we're really looking forward to it. 

''It's a mix of us presenting from different locations and there will also be stories coming from across the UK too.'
