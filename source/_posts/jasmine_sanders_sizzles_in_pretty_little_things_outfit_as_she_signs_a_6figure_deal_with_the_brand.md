She's never been afraid to show off her incredible figure. 

And Jasmine Sanders put her sensational physique on display as she posed in a flesh-flashing tropical co-ord and bikini top on Saturday. 

The model, 29, looked sensational as she shared snaps in her PrettyLittleThing ensemble after it emerged she has just signed a six-figure deal with the brand.

Jasmine - who also goes by the name Golden Barbie - was a vision of beauty in a skimpy crop and wide leg beach trousers, which boasted an eye-catching tropical floral pattern. 

The trousers hugged Jasmine's figure, accentuating her enviable curves, whilst the tie front top offered a glimpse at her cleavage and slim figure. 

Jasmine's trademark blonde locks were worn loose and curly, as the model cooly gazed out across to the side of the camera. 

For makeup, the German-born beauty kept things simple and went with a dewy, natural glow.

It is unlikely to be the last time Jasmine gets to wear the latest PrettyLittleThing garb, as she recently signed a six-figure social media deal with the fast fashion brand. 

The deal means the model will be able to keep living comfortably as the nights draw in, following a summer that was largely spent in Miami with her boyfriend Anthony Rhoades.

The duo posted endless snaps of themselves sunbathing poolside, evoking the jealousy of fans the world over who were stuck in lockdown.  

Things are going strong for Jasmine and Anthony, who started dating earlier this year but have known one another for some time, according to People.

'They’re happy! Anthony is so supportive of Jasmine, and she is of him,' an insider told the publication.

Making it very official, the duo got tattoos of each other's names in July.
