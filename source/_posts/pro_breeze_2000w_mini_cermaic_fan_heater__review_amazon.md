This week we officially entered the autumn season. 

As we prepare for shorter days and the inevitable colder weather, many of us will be looking for simple ways to reduce the heating bill.

If you want a temporary fix to save from running the central heating, especially now so many of us are working from home, then the Pro Breeze 2000W Mini Ceramic Fan Heater is a savvy solution. One of the highest rated electric fan heaters on Amazon, it's small, mighty and affordable. 

The Pro Breeze® 2000W Mini Ceramic Fan Heater is one of the highest rated fan heaters on Amazon with over 2,000 reviews and an average score of 4.6 

With over 2,000 glowing reviews and a combined average score of 4.6, the Pro Breeze 2000W Mini Ceramic Fan Heater has caught the attention of many discerning shoppers. 

The Pro Breeze has been described as 'powerful but discreet', so rest assured it will pack a punch. Whether you're looking to cut back on the central heating or warm up a conservatory or caravan, this will do the trick. 

Unlike a lot of fan heaters, the Pro Breeze stands out thanks to its clever oscillating function. While many fan heaters are ideal for a small spaces, thanks to the 60 degree oscillation mode, this one is also suitable for larger rooms.

The ceramic heating elements also make for faster and more efficient heating. In fact, many shoppers have commented on how quickly it heats up a room.  

'Such a powerful but discreet heater,' wrote one shopper 'Much more powerful than other heaters the same size. I have two of these now as they are so good. 

'One for an outdoor office and one in our conservatory. It can be below zero outside but within 10 mins of having this heater on we can comfortably sit in the conservatory that has no other heating.'

The lightweight and compact heater is super efficient and can be used all round the house 

Another added: 'Wow! What a find. Bought to supplement heater in Motorhome when on electric hook-ups. It's an amazing little machine. Light, compact, easy to use, heats up very quickly and chucks out an amazing amount of heat - certainly perfect for the Motorhome.' 

A third shopper commented: 'It heats the whole room so much quicker than anything else that I have ever tried. The safety cut off is second to none, the heating element is hidden so you can not grab hold of it or fall into it. The controls are easy to use and you can control it with no trouble at all.'

Quickly bringing rooms to a comfortable level, the Pro Breeze Mini Ceramic Fan Heater is cost and energy efficient for a short amount of time.  

That being said, it can get a little noisy. While shoppers have largely noted that the pros outweigh this, it's worth noting in case you're planning to use it in a bedroom.
