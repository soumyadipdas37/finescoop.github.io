'Doting stepmother' Princess Beatrice has put up 'loads of pictures' of husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi's son in their home so he 'feels like he has two families', sources have claimed.

The Queen's granddaughter, 32, became the first stepmother among the young generation of royals after marrying Edoardo, 36, in July.

The property tycoon shares a young son, three-year-old Christopher 'Wolfie' Woolf, with his glamorous former fiancée of three-and-a-half years, Dara Huang.

Insiders told The Telegraph's Camilla Tominey that the royal has been embracing her new role, saying: 'Beatrice ensured there are loads of pictures of him up in their house, so he feels like he has two families, and they do get on well. She has instigated a lot of that, rather than Dara.'

Beatrice, who is ninth in line to the throne, is a granddaughter of the Queen, is the only princess to marry someone with children and take on a stepchild.

Edo is said to enjoy an amicable relationship with Dara and prides himself on still being an active part of his son's life.

And sources have now revealed how Beatrice has thrown herself into the role of 'doting stepmother'.

They claimed she has become a regular at collecting Wolfie from nursery and accompanying him home on his scooter.

Friends of the royal said she talks about the youngster 'all the time' and has warmly embraced him into her life.

They added that he is 'super little' and 'extremely cute', adding that Beatrice will always make Wolfie's happiness 'her number one priority' even when she and Edo decide to have children themselves.  

Meanwhile Camilla went on to say that Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, who announced her pregnancy last week, will be keeping a 'lower profile' over the next few months as they prioritise family. 

The royal sisters have faced a momentous 12 months over the last year, with Princess Beatrice's wedding, Princess Eugenie's pregnancy and their father Prince Andrew stepping down from royal duty. 

According to the royal expert, Prince Andrew's Jeffrey Epstein scandal laid rest to any discussions about Princess Beatrice or Princess Eugenie taking on a more full time role within The Firm 

Beatrice is understood to have been particularly affected by press following Prince Andrew's disastrous Newsnight interview last November.

The Duke of York's friendship with the disgraced billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein drew him into a scandal that continues to shake the royal family. 

But Camilla added that the scandal had laid rest to any discussion about Princess Beatrice and Eugenie stepping into more senior full-time royal positions within The Firm.

An insider explained: 'In many ways, what has happened with their father has finally settled the debate over their future. It actually makes life a little easier for them.' 

The comments come days after Eugenie and husband Jack Brooksbank, who married in October 2018, revealed they are expecting their first child together in 'early 2021'. A statement from Buckingham Palace said her grandmother the Queen was 'delighted'.

Sharing the news on Instagram, Eugenie wrote: 'Jack and I are so excited for early 2021....,' alongside photos of baby slippers and her and Jack smiling. 

Sarah Ferguson shared her own excitement in a separate Instagram post, writing: 'I am so excited by the news that Eugenie and Jack are expecting their first child. Thrilled for them both and in my 60th year cannot wait to be a grandmother. Welcoming a new baby into the York family is going to be a moment of profound joy.' 

The baby will be the first grandchild for Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, and will be the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's ninth great-grandchild.

A spokesman for the duchess told the Mail that while she was clearly overjoyed at Eugenie's news, she also wanted to stress that she and Andrew very much saw Beatrice's stepson, Wolfie, as a grandchild too.

'Wolfie is already a very much-loved member of their family and the duchess is very keen to stress that she sees Wolfie as their grandchild too,' they said.
