A 27-year-old British man drowned yesterday while swimming off a beach in Corfu, just a day after a mother-of-four was killed when she was hit by a speedboat propeller. 

The man, who is yet to be identified, was swimming several hundred feet from the shore of Kerasia beach in northeastern Corfu, when he was seen struggling in the water, Corfu Press reports. 

Witnesses said locals jumped in the sea to save him and dragged the man to shore.

When he was pulled from the ocean the man was already unconscious, according to local media. Onlookers called the coastguard who tried to resuscitate the man using a defibrilator.

Unfortunately, he died before they reached the hospital. 

According to local news site enimerosi, the victim was on holiday with his girlfriend. 

The man's death comes just a day after Claire Glatman, 60, the wife of multimillionaire property tycoon Mark Glatman, was killed when she was hit by a speedboat while swimming in the sea off Avlaki beach, Corfu on Monday. 

Three English nationals aged between 20 and 30, two of whom have holiday homes on the island, are being investigated in relation to Mrs Glatman's death, local media reported.

This morning it was reported hedge fund manager Rob Lucas, 58, his son, 18, and daughter, 22, were questioned as possible witnesses by officers after Mrs Glatman's death.  

The speedboat thought to have been involved in the incident was found abandoned at a nearby beach and has been moved to a local marina while port authorities carry out a forensic investigation.

Mrs Glatman was from Bedale in North Yorkshire and was on holiday with Mark, 63, and the eldest of her two daughters, who have been informed of her death. She also has two sons.
