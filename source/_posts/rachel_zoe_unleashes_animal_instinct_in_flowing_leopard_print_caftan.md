Rachel Zoe was glimpsed emerging from lockdown in Los Angeles this Friday and enjoying a stroll with one of her children.

The 52-year-old unleashed her animal instinct in a billowing leopard print caftan as she stepped out for her latest sighting.

She shares her two sons, nine-year-old Skyler and six-year-old Kaius, with her husband of 24 years Rodger Berman.

Zoe celebrated her latest birthday Tuesday with a trip to San Ysidro Ranch in California alongside her husband and children.

The celebrity stylist posted a heartwarming video of herself blowing out the candles on her cake with her sons by her side.

'I am truly overwhelmed by the love I felt today from so many of you and my extraordinary friends and family,' she gushed in the caption.

'In the insanity of this time, I am feeling extra #grateful for my health and happiness and the blessing of just being surrounded by my angels and my @rbermanus who made today just perfect,' Rachel went on.

'Thank you beyond for all of the birthday love everyone... it means even more this year. Another trip around the sun and feeling ready for the next one.. #birthday #love #gratitude XoRZ,' she signed off her message.

San Ysidro Ranch hit the headlines last year as the place where Jurassic World sizzler Chris Pratt married Arnold Schwarzenegger's daughter Katherine.

The venue is also where Vivien Leigh married Laurence Olivier and Neil Armstrong tied the knot with his second wife Carol Knight.

John F. Kennedy, the maternal uncle of Katherine's mother Maria Shriver, also honeymooned there with Jacqueline Kennedy.
