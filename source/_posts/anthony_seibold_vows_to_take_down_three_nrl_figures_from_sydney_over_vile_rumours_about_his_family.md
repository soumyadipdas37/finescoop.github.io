Sacked Brisbane Broncos coach Anthony Seibold has handed over three names to the NRL Integrity Unit.

The 45-year-old was at the centre of a series of vile rumours by online trolls in recent weeks targeting him and his family.   

Seibold employed a European cyber-security firm to trace who spread the false rumours about his personal life.

Now the tracers are certain they've found those responsible.

The legal team of the 2018 coach of the years sent a dossier to the NRL which includes the names of three NRL identities in Sydney, according to the Courier Mail.

Although Seibold is against the making the names public, if he wishes to take the case further and inform the NSW and Queensland Police, the identities will have to be made public.

More to follow.
