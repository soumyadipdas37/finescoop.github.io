She has co-hosted Channel Nine's The Block for the past nine seasons, all while juggling motherhood and house flipping with her husband Christian Sergiacomi.

And on Tuesday, Shelley Craft revealed just how she has maintained her trim physique and healthy lifestyle over the years.

The youthful 44-year-old told New Idea she has a 'rhythm' that helps her stay 'Block fit' while travelling between her home in Byron Bay and the show's Melbourne building site.

'You do get into a rhythm, you do get "Block fit" and used to those sleepless nights,' she said.

The mother-of-two, who is known to enjoy outdoor activities like surfing, also explained that she uses her two hour flight as her 'down time' to relax.

'I find those two hours are my down time. I take it as my real mediation moments... I love that freedom and luxury of being able to raise my family here [in Byron],' she said.

In terms of diet, she previously told the magazine that when she is at home she follows a fasting diet, only eating between midday and 6pm. 

'I find this gets my digestion working really well - it never feels like I'm fasting,' she said.

Meanwhile, her co-host Scott Cam also revealed to New Idea that he has lost some weight, dropping nine kilos.
