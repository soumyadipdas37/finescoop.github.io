Max has won 44 caps for Scotland as a centre and wing rugby union player, and is currently without a club after being released by Castres Olympique at the end of the 2015 season. 

According to reports, Nicole is trying for a baby with her handsome beau Thom after less than a year of dating. 

The singer is said to be keen to start a family of her own with Thom, as the couple are looking to the future and intend on purchasing a property together in London.

A friend told The Sun: 'Thom told pals he's been taking supplements to boost fertility. Nicole and Thom are ridiculously loved-up, and have had serious conversations about everything from marriage to babies. 

'No one would be surprised if they had some baby news in the coming months.

'Thom currently lives with his brother and a housemate in London which hardly makes for a romantic love nest. They are looking to buy a house together once lockdown is over.'

Nicole's representatives declined to comment and MailOnline also contacted Thom's representatives at the time, who are yet to comment.
