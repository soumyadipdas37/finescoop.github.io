Morrisons has reinstated door marshals at its stores to limit the number of shoppers amid fears of Covid-19 panic buying - as supermarkets double their delivery slots to prepare for a second wave.

 Staff will be stationed at all 494 of Morrisons supermarkets to monitor shoppers and remind them to wear face masks.

 It comes as bosses at Britain's big chains insisted they have enough stock and delivery slots for everyone, as they try to prevent scenes of panic buying seen back in March.

Morrisons has reinstated marshals to monitor customer numbers and remind them to wear masks, while Tesco has boosted its online ordering capacity

Tesco's weekly ordering capacity has risen from 600,000 to 1.5million - but it remains fully booked until Wednesday, The Mirror has reported.

There are three-day waiting times for Ocado, while Sainsbury's is experiencing high demand. 

The supermarket revealed the number of Christmas pudding searches was four times higher than this time last year.  

Concerned shoppers took to Twitter over the weekend to share photographs of their local supermarkets, showing shelves completely emptied of essential items.

One Twitter user shared photographs of an ASDA in London where cereals seemed in short supply, leaving shoppers with fewer brands to choose from.

Another shopper posted pictures of a Tesco in the West Midlands, where kitchen roll and toilet roll was in short supply - but had not been completely cleared out.

Andrew Opie, head of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told The Mirror: 'We urge consumers to be considerate and shop for food as they would usually during this difficult time.'

One supermarket worker in Birmingham told the paper: 'Some people are definitely panic buying again. We have 4,000 more items this weekend than we usually would. 

'When the panic buying started months ago, we hadn't experienced it. We are prepared now.'
