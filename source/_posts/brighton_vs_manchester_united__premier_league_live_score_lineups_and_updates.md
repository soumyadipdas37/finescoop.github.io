Brighton welcome Manchester United to the Amex Stadium this afternoon in Premier League action as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men look to bounce back from their 3-1 loss to Crystal Palace.  

United finished last season in flying form, with the influence of Bruno Fernandes key in guiding the Red Devils into the Premier League top four.  

However, Solskjaer's side looked miles away from the team that ended the league campaign as one of the in-form sides in England. They'll be hoping to get up and running this afternoon but face a tough challenge in Brighton, who were fantastic in their last league outing at Newcastle, winning 3-0. 

Sportsmail's OLLIE LEWIS will provide live Premier League coverage of Brighton vs Man United including score, lineups and build-up, with the action set to get under way at 12.30pm BST.
