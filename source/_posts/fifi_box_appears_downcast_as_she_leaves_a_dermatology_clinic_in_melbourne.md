Fifi Box appeared downcast as she attended an appointment in Melbourne following the death of her daughter Trixie's half-sister Jaimi Kenny at the age of 33.

The radio host wore a black face mask as she exited a dermatologist's office on Tuesday, carrying a piece of paper. 

The 43-year-old was dressed in all black, including a pair of loose black three-quarter trousers.

She added a shirt and flowing cardigan over the top, in the same dark tones, and more multi-print flats. 

Fifi appeared makeup-free and had a large pair of sunglasses covering up her famous face.   

She appeared in low spirits, raising her hand to her face as she walked to her car.

The radio star pulled out of her breakfast radio show earlier on Tuesday following news that Jaimi had died.

Her absence was briefly alluded to on Fox FM's Fifi, Fev and Byron, with host Byron Cooke saying: 'Well, Fi is away today but the show must go on.'  

Fifi welcomed Trixie, seven, in 2013 after a brief relationship with Jaimi's father, Ironman Grant Kenny.

Despite their break-up remained close to Grant's children from his previous marriage to Lisa Curry: Jaimi, Morgan and Jett.  

She hasn't commented publicly on Jaimi's death, but it's believed they were close.

Jaimi's mother, three-time Olympian Lisa Curry, separated from Grant in 2009 after 23 years of marriage, before finalising their divorce in 2017.  

It comes after Lisa released a heartbreaking statement about the death of her eldest child on Tuesday.

The 58-year-old former competitive swimmer spoke of her 'unbearable' pain in a gut-wrenching Instagram post.

'Our hearts are completely broken. Our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital yesterday morning with her loving family by her side,' Lisa wrote.  

'I just can't believe you're not here anymore. I sit and just shake my head. It doesn't seem real or right. You will forever be with me in my heart, Jaimi. I love you so much.'
