A former tennis coach will face court charged with indecently assaulting a teenage girl in the NSW Hunter region 20 years ago.

In 2017, detectives began investigating alleged indecent assault offences committed against a teenage girl in the late 1990s and the early 2000s.

In July this year, a 57-year-old man was given a court attendance notice.

Police will allege in court the man, who was a tennis coach, indecently assaulted a girl he was coaching - aged between 13 and 17 at the time - on multiple occasions in the East Maitland and Hunter region.

He will appear at Maitland Local Court on Wednesday.
