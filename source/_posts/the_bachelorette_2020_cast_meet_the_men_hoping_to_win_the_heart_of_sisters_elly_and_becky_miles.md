Some of the men hoping to win the heart of sisters Elly and Becky Miles on the upcoming season of The Bachelorette have been revealed.

On Monday, Channel 10 released the first official glimpse of the sister act's suitors - with a dancer, a hunky rugby star and a professional fitness model among the lineup.

Bachelor fans have already managed to identity a few of the contestants.

Joe Woodbury, 25, Newcastle, NSW 

Newcastle-based rugby player Joe Woodbury is one of the many men who will be vying for Elly's heart.

And it appears the pair have already crossed paths before filming the reality dating show, with Elly already following Joe on Instagram prior to filming starting.

The tattooed winger has previously made headlines thanks to his impressive football skills.

Pete Mann, Adelaide 

Pete is tipped to go quite far on the season.

The Adelaide-based café owner has been previously pictured going on a single date with Becky, 30, earlier this year.

He owns Octeine, an environmentally conscious café who offer discounts for customers who bring in their own takeaway reusable coffee cups.

Professional fitness model Rudy El Kholti, 30, is set to provide plenty of eye candy on the forthcoming season. 

No stranger to taking his shirt off on social media, Rudy is already verified on Instagram and currently has 32,000. Expect those numbers to grow.

Andrew Thomas, Adelaide

Andrew is an Adelaide-based voice over actor who has appeared in radio campaigns for Fitness First and local tattoo parlors.

He is said to have a big heart and even bigger laugh.

The trained actor-turned-travel influencer will surely be roaring with laughter in the Bachelorette mansion, as he gets to know Elly and Becky.
