They have both forged successful careers in the modelling industry.

And on Friday, Natasha Oakley and Simone Holtznagel looked simply sensational on a beach photo shoot in Byron Bay, New South Wales.

The blonde beauties revealed their toned figures in skimpy pink bikinis, presumably from Natasha's label, MONDAY Swimwear. 

Sizzling hot! Models Natasha Oakley (left), 30, and Simone Holtznagel (right), 27, revealed their sensational figures in skimpy pink bikinis on a photo shoot in Byron Bay, NSW on Friday 

Natasha wore an underwire bikini top that enhanced her cleavage and washboard stomach, teamed with matching tie briefs that elongated her lean legs.

The 30-year-old's signature blonde locks were styled out and in waves, and she appeared to sport minimal makeup, drawing attention to her natural beauty.  

Natasha later changed into a pink triangle bikini top and matching high-cut briefs.

Simone donned a bandeau bikini top in a matching pink hue, and high-cut briefs that showed off her cleavage, toned tummy and trim pins.

Simone, who rose to fame after competing in the 2011 season of Australia's Next Top Model, wore her blonde locks out and in waves, framing her striking facial features.

She also changed into a pink triangle bikini top, wrapped a pink sarong around her trim waist, and accessorised with a stylish round-rimmed hat.
