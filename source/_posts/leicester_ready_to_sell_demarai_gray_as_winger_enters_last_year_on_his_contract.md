Leicester City will listen to offers for Demarai Gray after agreeing terms with Roma for winger Cengiz Under.

Gray, 24, has one year left on contract and could be willing to see it out with the prospect of leaving as a free agent next summer.

Manager Brendan Rodgers said: 'It'll be up to him. He's in his last year and he hasn't signed another deal but, for me, I will always respect Demarai and what his wishes are.

'He is working very hard to play a part while he's here. We'll see how it evolves over the course of the season.

'I've really enjoyed working with him. He's a good guy and has been here since he was a young player. While he's here he will always be respected for his quality and what he has.

'He is now 24 and it'll be whether he wants to continue in the role he's played here or whether he sees himself going out and becoming a starter.'

Gray could find his chances limited by the arrival of winger Cengiz Under from Roma

Turkey international Under is joining on loan with an option to buy for £24.6million.

Rodgers added: 'He's a very good player, there's been some negotiations with the clubs so we're hopeful we can get something there,' he said.

'We needed different types of attacking players to come in and support. Having watched him and seen him play he is clearly a talented player.'
