Phillip Schofield took a friendly jibe at Piers Morgan after This Morning beat Good Morning Britain to win a TV Choice Award.

The chat show, hosted by Phillip and Holly Willoughby, took home the gong for Best Daytime Show with Alison Hammond presenting the award to the pair on Monday.

With fellow ITV series Good Morning Britain also up for the award, Phillip couldn't resist saying: 'Thank you, sorry Piers!' after his win.

Alison made the announcement, taking the award out of the oven as she informed viewers there was no ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic.

She said: 'This Morning has won a TV Choice Award for Best Daytime TV show everyone. It’s in the oven. 

'Because of Covid, there’s no award show or anything. This is the fifth one we’ve won now. We’ve beat GMB, Piers Morgan, Loose Women, The Chase.

Holly added: 'And we do like this award because it’s voted for by the readers.'

Alison admitted she thought This Morning won the prize due to their coverage of the Covid-19 crisis.

She said: 'This is due to Covid why we’ve got this and we do deserve it. We do.'

It comes after Piers' co-host Susanna Reid called him a 'chubster', after he revealed he had put on half a stone on in lockdown.

Piers, 55, encouraged his co-host, 49, to fat-shame him live on Good Morning Britain on Monday, so he could use the insults as motivation to shed the pounds.

Susanna, who admitted she had put on a stone over the past couple of months, called the columnist: 'You fat person'.

Piers said: 'Like a lot of people in lockdown, especially when you bust your ankle up, I have put on weight.

'I am carrying too much weight. I reckon I put on at least half a stone, three quarters of a stone. I need to be fat-shamed to get it off.' 

Taking the bait, Susanna told him: 'Yes, you fat person, lose the weight. It's about time, chubster.' 

Holly added: 'And we do like this award because it’s voted for by the readers'

While Piers said the insults would help him lose the weight, Susanna said: 'That brings me out in hives just saying that.'

To which the Britain's Got Talent judge told her: 'No, that will genuinely have the right affect on me.

'I will go back today and probably eat a little less cheese and put the second bottle away and try to get back on the Peloton for the first time in a few months.

'I think we all need to be slightly shamed about weight.'

But Susanna disagreed and told him: 'No, I don't think shaming works. Sensible advice works. Throwing insults does not help people lose weight.'

Piers shouted: 'No, saying "stop chunking up fatso and eating so many cakes", that works. That's what you need to be told.'
