Brighton host Chelsea in final game of the first week of Premier League's return as Frank Lampard looks to unleash his new signings.  

Graham Potter's side will be hoping they can make a good impression at the AMEX Stadium in their first match of the 2020-21 season. 

Meanwhile, there is plenty of anticipation to see how Chelsea perform with a cluster of fresh faces in the squad. All eyes will be on striker Timo Werner and midfielder Kai Havertz.
