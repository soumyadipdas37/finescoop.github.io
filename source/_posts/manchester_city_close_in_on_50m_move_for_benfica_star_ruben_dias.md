Manchester City are closing on a £50million deal for Benfica defender Ruben Dias.

The centre back captained Benfica and scored in their 2-0 win over Moreirense on Saturday then effectively confirmed his pending departure hugging team-mates and sporting director Rui Costa.

Talking to Benfica TV afterwards, the 23-year old said: 'This was a special moment for me and I think everyone understands why.

'I'm very happy of course, it was a very important game for me and being able to mark this game with a goal was very special. I believe that everyone already has a idea of why I hugged Rui Costa.'

City have offered cash plus defender Nicolas Otamendi in negotiations and hope to conclude the finer details by the start of the week.

Benfica manager, Jorge Jesus on Ruben Dias: 'I'm pretty sure it was his last game. He's a player we're sorry to see go. But I also have some fault that he left today. This also has to do with missing the Champions League and there are things that need to be balanced.'

Dias has a long-term contract until the summer of 2024 at the Portuguese side.

Guardiola is an admirer of the Portugal international, who made 49 appearances across all competitions for club and country last season. 

Meanwhile, 20-year-old City defender Joel Latibeaudiere is attracting loan enquiries from Swansea City, Bristol City, Luton Town and Bournemouth.
