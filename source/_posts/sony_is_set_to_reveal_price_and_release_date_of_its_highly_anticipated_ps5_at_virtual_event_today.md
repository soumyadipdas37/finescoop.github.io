Sony is set to host its PS5 showcase event that reveals the pricing and release date of its highly anticipated gaming console.

The 40-minute virtual broadcast will be held virtually and kicks off at 4pm ET Wednesday, which will also include updates on Sony games and those coming from third-party partners.

The PlayStation 5 was first unveiled in June and will be available in two models – one includes a disc drive and the other only plays games through downloads.

Sony’s move to release the information follows Microsoft’s announcement last week that provided details of its Xbox Series S and X consoles.

However, it is not clear which system the PlaySation 5 will compete with in regards to price – the Series S retails for $299 and the Series X at $499.

Sony has surrounded its PS5 in mystery for months, keeping a tight lid on details and only releasing some in increments.

However, users have made their own assumptions on pricing and the release date of the gaming console.

In 2019, leaks suggested it would be ‘officially introduced’ on November 20, 2020 in North America and come with a $499 price tag.

Although Sony has not confirmed or denied these details, they could be spot on with what the firm announces at the showcase event.

The world received its first look at the PlayStation 5 on June 11, which Sony said is ‘The Future of Gaming.’

The sleek, white system  stands upright and comes with black trimming, but some have said a come black model will make its way to market as well.

One model will include a standard a disc drive, while a second option, called 'PlayStation 5 Digital Edition,' will lack a disc drive and likely only play games downloaded over the internet but not physical discs bought in stores.

A selection of accessories will also be available for PS5, including a wireless charging station for its DualSense controllers, a media remote control for those who want to use it to stream video, and PlayStation-branded over-the-ear headphones with 3D audio support.

Sony is also to announce updates on games, which could include those unveiled in June. The gallery included new entries in familiar franchises such as Resident Evil Village, Gran Turismo 7, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Horizon 2: Forbidden West, and Spider-Man: Miles Morales

The company also showed off original titles, including Ghostwire Tokyo, a supernatural thriller set in a futuristic version of the Japanese capital; Stray, a game from publisher Annapurna Interactive that follows a cat living in a city of robots; and Returnal, a third-person shooter from Finnish studio Housemarque about an astronaut trapped on an alien planet.

As well as dazzling with a revamped line-up of revived favorites, Sony rolled out a teaser for NBA 2k21 showcasing the full graphic power of the PS5.

Rookie phenom Zion Williamson is seen dribbling on an empty court and dunking, but the detail in the movements is what caught the attention of fans around the world.

The simulation basketball game has an enormous following, particularly in the US, and Greg Thomas, co-founder of developer Visual Concepts, said the game has been 'built from the ground up to fully utilize the incredible power, speed and technology of PS5'.
