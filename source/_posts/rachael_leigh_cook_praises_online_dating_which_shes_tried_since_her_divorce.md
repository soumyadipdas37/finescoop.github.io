She began divorce proceedings this summer, and is already moving on.

Rachael Leigh Cook took part in a video interview with TooFab on Thursday, in which she made another reference to her new man, so far known only as Kevin.

The She's All That star, 40, was there to chat with Damon Wayans, Jr. about their new Netflix comedy Love, Guaranteed, which dropped that day.

The film follows a single man (played by Wayans) who sues a dating app company after being promised he'd find love, which prompted the pair of stars to share their opinion of online dating. 

'I have a little bit, you know, it's interesting,' Cook, who split from husband of 15 years Daniel Gillies last year, said of meeting someone online. 

'It's the best possible way to talk to a stranger. I like it!'

However Cook, who shares two children with Gillies, was quick to follow up with the fact that she's no longer on the market.

'But I'm dating someone wonderful now, so I've stopped that,' she stated, referring to her new beau Kevin, to whom she's referred as a 'fancy' producer and swim teacher.

And it should be mentioned, Rachael did not meet Kevin online – she was reported set up through her dear friend, Jawbreaker star Judy Greer.  

But Cook did maintain that, 'as an actor,' meeting someone online is 'interesting'.

'It's pretty fun to see the way – just as an actor – I just think it's interesting to see how people present themselves,' she added during the chat. 

'There's a character study moment.' 

Damon, meanwhile, couldn't help but crack a joke.

'I online date mainly when my wife's asleep,' the Happy Endings actor kidded.

But he did say he had friends with good online dating stories, as well as those with 'horror stories'.

Still, 'I know a couple who have been going strong for probably like three years now and they met online,' he added.

Rachael concurred, mentioning her 'friend [who] has been married for five years now to "SilverlakeRob" and we can't call him anything else.'

In an interview with Us Weekly last month, the actress opened up about the new man in her life.

'He's really great. I did good, if I do say so. Definitely hitting out of my league there,' the Minnesota native said.

'I met someone really nice, and I adore him. He's fantastic.'

Cook and Gillies, who announced their split over a year ago after about 15 years of marriage, share two children: daughter Charlotte, six, and son Theodore, five.

According to court documents obtained by Us, Cook is seeking joint custody of their kids in their ongoing divorce proceedings.

Of her role in the new comedy Love, Guaranteed, in which she plays the attorney Wayans Jr. hires and eventually falls for, Rachael says she enjoyed it deeply.

'Paying someone who's surprised by love in their life is... it's one of the most fun things to play!' 

Love, Guaranteed is streamable on Netflix now.
