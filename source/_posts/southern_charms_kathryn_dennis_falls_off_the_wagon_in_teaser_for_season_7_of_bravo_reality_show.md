They've been dealing with COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter.

And on Thursday, the cast of Bravo's Southern Charm, filmed in Charleston, returned in a new sneak peek of the reality show's upcoming seventh season.

The group of South Carolina friends are seen discussing the coronavirus pandemic, dealing with the cultural fall out of the renewed protests against systemic racism and, of course, detailing their romantic entanglements.

Back for more: Bravo released a sneak peek at the seventh season of reality show Southern Charm, centered on a group of friends in Charleston, South Carolina, on Thursday  

Drama: And the show's most notorious star Kathryn Dennis is once again front and center as she navigates the news that her ex Thomas Ravenel is having a baby with another woman

The show's most notorious star Kathryn Dennis is back - and back on the booze.

The ex-partner of Thomas Ravenel, with whom she shares two children, appears to have fallen off the wagon as she's shown downing a shot and making fun of her lapse in sobriety.

The troubled redhead also has to deal in the new season with the news that Ravenel is having a baby with another woman and claims she sent racially charged messages over social media including using a monkey emoji in a message to a Black woman.

Scandal: The troubled redhead is also accused of sending racist messages to a Black woman and newcomer Leva Bonaparte confronts Dennis for 'living in a bubble of white privilege'

History: Bonaparte also points out to other castmembers that nineteenth century politician and defender of slavery John C. Calhoun is an ancestor of Dennis, causing shockwaves

'In my heart, I know I'm the furthest thing from racist,' Dennis is seen saying as she denies sending a monkey emoji.

Newcomer Leva Bonaparte, who is of Persian descent and married to Charleston native Lamar, confronts Dennis for 'living in a bubble of white privilege.'

She also points out to other castmembers that nineteenth century politician and defender of slavery John C. Calhoun is an ancestor of Dennis.

'For me, it's about the change I want to see in this little southern town of mine,' Leva says in the sneak peek

The trailer clip shows footage of Calhoun's statue being removed from its prominent place in Charleston earlier this year.

Returning castmember Danni Baird appears shocked at the connection between Dennis and Calhoun. 

Baird is also shown having a face-to-face conversation on her porch with Dennis about the state of their friendship, which ends with her telling Dennis to leave.

Girl trouble: Shep Rose returns and, naturally, his romantic entanglements continue to be a source of drama

Meanwhile, Austen Kroll's on/off girlfriend Madison LeCroy has been recruited as a full-time member of the cast for season seven.

Absent, though, are Cameran Eubanks, Naomie Olindo and Chelsea Meissner who announced earlier this year they were leaving the show.

The new season of Southern Charm was filmed between February and July with cast also documenting some of the drama themselves during lockdown.

Previous seasons are currently available to watch on NBCUniversal's new streaming platform Peacock.
