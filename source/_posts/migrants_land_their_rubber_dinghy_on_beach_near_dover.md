Migrants were seen running across a beach in Kent after their boat crossed the Channel earlier today.

The group of around ten, who were crammed on a rubber dinghy, were spotted leaping out and running across the beach towards scattered trees as their vessel neared the shore at Kingsdown beach, near Dover, on Monday morning.

The scenes come as Home Secretary Priti Patel faces increasing pressure to act following a sharp upsurge in Channel migrant numbers to more than 6,000 so far this year. 

Border Force and French patrols have been active in the Dover Strait since the early hours of the morning.

Kent Police and immigration enforcement officers were also seen in the area.

The latest crossings come after hundreds of people managed to reach the UK on Friday, with thousands making the hazardous journey since the start of 2020.

Weather conditions in the Channel on Monday were calm, with low winds making the sea crossing possible.

The group of suspected migrants, who appeared to all be men, arrived squeezed on board a grey dinghy with a black outboard motor on the back.

Many wore hooded jumpers and one was seen carrying a backpack as they headed off from the shoreline at speed.

Later, the dinghy was seen being towed back out to sea where it was taken on board Border Force cutter Seeker, which arrived in the area soon after the landings.

In Kingsdown village centre, Kent Police and coastguard officials were seen talking to members of the public following the landing.

Six miles down the coast, more migrants were brought into the port of Dover.

People wearing blankets and lifejackets were seen aboard Border Force patrol boat Hunter before being escorted up a gangway.

Once ashore they will be processed and assessed for symptoms of coronavirus, in line with protocol. 

The scenes comes after data showed that more than 6,000 migrants have successfully crossed to the UK in small boats this year. 

It also comes just a month after Home Secretary Priti Patel warned France that the UK would not spend millions of pounds for anti-migration patrols unless it agreed to take back more refugees.

During a zoom call in August, Ms Patel said France's demand for £30million to fund Channel patrols and surveillance would be dependent on it taking in more of those seeking to get to the UK.

She added that the system was being 'exploited by leftie Labour-supporting lawyers' who were trying to stop the Government from removing people.   

Addressing the rising number of migrants crossing the Channel Ms Patel's newly appointed Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, Dan O'Mahoney, said: 'These crossings are dangerous and unnecessary and I am determined to stop them.

'The minister and I met with French officials in Paris on Tuesday for discussions on how to advance joint working on making the small boats route for illegal migration unviable.

'We will continue to go after the heinous criminals and organised crime networks putting people's lives at risk.'
