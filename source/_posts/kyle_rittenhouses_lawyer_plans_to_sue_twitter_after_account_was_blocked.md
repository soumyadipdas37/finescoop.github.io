An attorney for teen Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse plans to sue Twitter and take CEO Jack Dorsey's 'a** down' after his account was briefly suspended for 'glorifying violence'.

Lin Wood is one of several lawyers representing the 17-year-old after he was charged with shooting dead two protesters and injuring a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin last week. 

Wood said he was locked out of his Twitter account for nine hours on Tuesday night after he started tweeting about raising funds for Rittenhouse's legal defense. 

The attorney says he was falsely accused by Twitter of 'glorifying violence'. 

Twitter admitted after several hours that his account was mistakenly disabled.

'I was arrested today & confined in Twitter jail falsely accused of glorifying violence. I was exonerated this evening by a finding of 'incorrectly actioned.' I am free tonight,' Wood tweeted after his account was restored.

'Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested on 8/26 & is confined in Illinois jail falsely accused of murder. Kyle will be exonerated when truth is revealed by a finding of 'incorrectly actioned.' Kyle will be free soon.' 

One of his attorneys, Lin Wood, is now planning to sue Twitter and take CEO Jack Dorsey's 'a** down' after his account was briefly suspended for 'glorifying violence'

Wood now plans to file a lawsuit against Twitter and its CEO Jack Dorsey. 

He told Fox News that his account being blocked was just the later example of Twitter trying to censor conservatives. 

'I'm going to take Jack Dorsey's a** down,' Wood said. 

'He has been abusing the First Amendment of this country for his own agenda.'

Wood said he knew Twitter would try and censor him and that he had been careful to abide by Twitter's terms of service. 

'I knew they were going to censor me because I'm sending a message of hope,' he said. 'I'm sending a message of truth. And I'm sending a message that Kyle Rittenhouse is innocent.' 

He said he has been compiling a 'mountain of evidence' against the social media giant to prove they are suppressing free speech.  

A Twitter spokesperson later said Wood's account was mistakenly blocked. 

'This account was incorrectly actioned,' the spokesperson said. 'This has been reversed and the account has been reinstated.' 





Meanwhile, several Facebook users have reported that the social media platform has been preventing them from sharing links to donate to Rittenhouse's legal defense. 

Conservative YouTuber and conspiracy theorist Mark Dice said that Facebook had threatened to delete his account after he posted a video that showed Rittenhouse offering to help give first aid to protesters prior to the shootings. 

He said Facebook removed the video and issued him a warning saying they don't allow praise or support for 'dangerous individuals'. 

'In no way did I 'glorify' or celebrate him, nor 'praise' him. I simply posted a non-graphic video, and stated as a matter of fact what it showed. He helped a protester who was injured and didn't show up in Kenosha with any malicious intent to cause trouble,' Dice tweeted.

'I would be shocked if they didn't ban me completely by tomorrow for my other posts about the case.' 

Rittenhouse remains in jail after being charged as an adult with two counts of first-degree homicide and one count of attempted homicide following the shootings on the third night of protests in Kenosha in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake. 

Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber were killed and Gaige Grosskreutz was shot in the arm in a series of encounters that were captured on cellphone videos.

Several Facebook users, including another of the teen gunman's lawyers, have reported that the social media platform has been preventing them from sharing links to donate to Rittenhouse's legal defense

Witness accounts and cellphone video show that the shootings took place in two stages: Rittenhouse first shot Rosenbaum, then jogged away, stumbled and fell in the street, and opened fire again on Huber and Grosskreutz as members of the crowd closed in him. 

After the gunfire, with his AR-15-style rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air, Rittenhouse walked toward police vehicles that kept going past him, even as a witness shouted, 'He just shot them!'

Police Chief Daniel Miskinis has explained the response as officers dealing with a chaotic scene. 

Rittenhouse's lawyers say the teen later turned himself in. 

While prosecutors call his conduct criminal, his lawyers say he defended himself against a mob trying to disarm and hurt him. They and other supporters portray him as a hero who stood up to lawlessness.  

Trump on Monday sided with the 17-year old on the eve of his visit to Kenosha.

'He was trying to get away from them,' Trump said of Rittenhouse. 

'And then he fell and then they very violently attacked him. I guess he was in very big trouble... He probably would have been killed.'
