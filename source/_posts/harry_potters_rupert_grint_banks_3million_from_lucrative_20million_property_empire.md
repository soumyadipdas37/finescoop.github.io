Rupert Grint is laughing all the way to Gringotts after making a £3million profit in the past year from his property empire.

The actor, 31, earned £40 million playing Harry Potter's best friend in the film adaptation of J.K Rowling's children's novel and has since made a number of savvy investments. 

Rupert's company account, Clay 10 Ltd, which was filed on Companies House on Sunday, is worth a whopping £20,304,021.

The companies net assets are up £3million compared to £17,558,012 in 2018.

This means Rupert made a staggering £58,000 a week from his lucrative property portfolio. 

Last year, the childhood star made one TV show for Apple named Servant but it seems his shrewd investments in property are bringing him wealthy returns.  

Wise: The actor, 31, (pictured 2010) earned £40 million playing Harry Potter's best friend in the film adaptation of J.K Rowling's novel and has since made a number of savvy investments 

A source previously told The Sun: 'Rupert's become a real property magnate and has been working his magic on building his empire.

'His portfolio is worth around £24million now and he's growing it all the time. 

'He has started three property businesses which are all bringing in a tidy sum.'

 Rupert's companies, Clay 10, invested in nearly £8million worth of property in the most recent financial year.

Another of his successful firms, Oneonesix Development, has been buying properties outside London.

The actor has been buying high-spec rental properties, as well as luxury homes, with good transport links to the city.

He most recently bought a £500,000 house in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, as well as two neighbouring houses for £1.5 million in Luton.   

Rupert also owns Eevil Plan Properties and has forked out on three properties near his own home in Hertfordshire.

In 2014, it was revealed his property empire was worth £12.9 million and was spread over a 20-mile radius in Hertfordshire, at the heart of London’s commuter belt.

The actor bought three properties around his home village for a combined £9.2million.

Another three, worth £3.7million, were registered in the names of his mother Joanna, 46, and father Nigel, 49, a former racing car driver listed as a co-director of Eevil Plan.

Following the success of the Harry Potter films, Mr and Mrs Grint paid £975,000 for a Hertford townhouse, which they run as a boutique hotel charging up to £150 per night. 

They also own two large farmhouses worth a combined £2.7million, both in their names.

It comes as the actor recently welcomed his first child with girlfriend Georgia Groome.

In a statement back in July, the couple announced that they were now proud parents to a baby girl, just a month after confirming they were expecting their first child.

Rupert and the Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging star announced their pregnancy in April after she stepped out with a noticeable baby bump.
