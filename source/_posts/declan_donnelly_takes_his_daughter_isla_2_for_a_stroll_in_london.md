He is gearing up to host his first series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! from Britain.

And Declan Donnelly cut a casual figure as he took his daughter Isla, two, for a stroll in London on Saturday.

The TV presenter, 44, opted for a laid back look for the outing in Chiswick, donning a grey jumper along with a pair of blue jeans.

Also sporting grey and blue trainers, Dec completed his look with a pair of sunglasses.

His daughter was dressed in a pink top with matching printed leggings and a cream cardigan.   

The Britain's Got Talent host shares his daughter with wife Ali Astall, 42, who he has been married to since August 2015.

Dec and his co-host Ant McPartlin were back on screens on Saturday night for the semi-finals of Britain's Got Talent.

The beloved presenting duo hit the right notes as they entertained viewers with a rat pack-influenced intro, which was most definitely a step up from their PJ and Duncan days. 

Singing and dancing their way through the show's opening, Ant and Dec were dressed to impress in sleek suits while introducing the talent show's return following the coronavirus lockdown.  

The series gave fans a sneak peek of the show's new socially-distanced judging panel ahead of the first semi-final on Saturday.

The new setup sees each judge placed on their own desks at least two metres apart to ensure the show is adhering to new safety guidelines during the COVID-19 crisis.

For the pre-recorded semis, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, David Walliams and new judge Ashley Banjo will be seated separately to adhere with strict new guidelines, with the shows also featuring a virtual audience watching from home.

Amanda has also been promoted to head judge, and joked she'd be backing 'musical theatre all the way,' if she had to make a deciding vote.

Simon Cowell, 60, was forced to pull out of BGT after breaking his back during a shock cycling accident, and has been replaced by Diversity star Ashley Banjo.

Following news of her promotion Amanda told MailOnline: 'I will vote musical theatre all the way if I need to make a deciding vote!'

Sources also told The Sun that Amanda was the obvious choice for bosses to be head judge, given she's appeared on the panel since the show's inception in 2007.

An insider said: 'It makes total sense for Amanda to be head judge with a deciding vote in a deadlock situation.

Hitting the right notes: Ant and Dec kicked this weekend's Britain's Got Talent semi-final with a high-octane musical number

'She's the only one, other than Simon, who has been there since Day One and has seen it all. She cannot wait for the responsibility boost and is certainly going to take it in her stride.'

Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.

The series will then culminate with the live final, in October, where one act will triumph as Britain’s Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.
