Luis Suarez's transfer to Juventus appears to be in its final stages — with talks between the Serie A side and Barcelona reportedly intensifying in the last few hours.

The 33-year-old striker looks set to combine with Cristiano Ronaldo next season rather than Lionel Messi with his time at the Nou Camp coming to an end. 

According to Sport, Suarez has already agreed to join Andrea Pirlo's side on a two-year contract worth approximately £9million-per-year and the two clubs are sorting the final details of the transfer.

The Uruguayan has one year remaining on his contract the Camp Nou but incoming manager Ronald Koeman confirmed the club's third all-time scorer would not be part of his plans this season. 

The report also indicates the two clubs have a good working relationship following the swap deal with Artur and Miralem Pjanic and there is a willingness from both parties to get the deal done.

It is also suggested the deal with have a similar structure to Ivan Rakitic's transfer to Sevilla, with a small fee up front and potential add-ons based on performance.

Suarez will be fondly remembered in Catalonia having delivered consistently for the team since joining from Liverpool for £74million six years ago.  

He scored a whopping 198 goals in 283 appearances, combining with Messi and for a time Neymar with devastating effect.  

Suarez was an integral part of the side that won the Champions League, LaLiga and Copa del Rey back in 2014-15. 

But this season has been dire for the club and he is just one of a number of big names likely to be shipped out in Ronald Koeman's overhaul.
