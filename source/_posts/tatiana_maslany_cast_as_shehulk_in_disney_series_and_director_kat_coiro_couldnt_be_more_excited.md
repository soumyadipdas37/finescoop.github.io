Director Kat Coiro confirmed Thursday that Emmy winner Tatiana Maslany has been cast in the titular role of her 2022 She-Hulk series for Disney+.

The New York-born filmmaker shared Deadline's report via Instagram and commented: 'Couldn't be more excited @tatianamaslany!'

Don't get her angry! Director Kat Coiro confirmed Thursday that Emmy winner Tatiana Maslany (pictured April 26) has been cast in the titular role of her 2022 She-Hulk series for Disney+ 

The New York-born filmmaker shared Deadline's report via Instagram and commented: 'Couldn't be more excited @tatianamaslany!'

The Canadian 34-year-old will officially join the Marvel Comics Universe as She-Hulk, which was one of the last major characters to be co-created by the late Stan Lee.

The green-skinned superhero starts off as highly-skilled lawyer Jennifer Walters, who transforms after having a life-saving (yet gamma-irradiated) blood transfusion from her cousin Bruce Banner/Hulk.

Whenever She-Hulk gets highly emotional - cue the PMS jokes - she can potentially become the physically strongest known woman in the MCU.
