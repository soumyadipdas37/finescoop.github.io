She's never afraid to own it when it comes to being real online or on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

And Lisa Rinna was quick to brush off claims that her husband Harry Hamlin was involved in an affair with a woman in 2018 near their summer house in Muskoka, Ontario, Canada. 

When one user alleged that her gal pal had been involved in a seasonal tryst with Hamlin, Rinna made sure to add her own brand of humor to deny the allegations.

'My girlfriend f***ed Harry Hamlin in muskoka for an entire summer in 2018 - you wanna talk about that @lisarinna???' Twitter user BiiigBrotherrrr wrote online Wednesday night. 'Or do you want to talk about his affair with Patricia?' 

Harry and Lisa have regularly whisked away to their cottage in the northern Ontario lake town near the Georgian Bay, roughly two hours north of Toronto.

Cindy Crawford, Goldie Hawn, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are just a few A-list stars reported to have homes in the Muskoka area. 

The user tweeted again: 'I don’t have any receipts but it’s legit. He told @lisarinna he’s “off the grid” for a few days and then literally spent an entire 2 days in my friends bedroom and at her cottage. Patricia is a muskoka w**** that everyone knows, Harry included.'

No brainer: Taking the news in stride, the RHOBH star responded to an Instagram snapshot of the social interaction

Taking the news in stride, Lisa responded to an Instagram snapshot of the social interaction.

'Yeah and I watched it was hot as hell,' the Days of Our Lives star wrote. 'Patricia well she’s kind of downer I did’t like her so much.'

Hamlin's rep of more than 20 years deferred to Rinna's Instagram comment when DailyMail.com asked about the allegations. 

While it was unclear who was the specific 'Patricia' from the tweets, fans hoped it was another Bravo star, Patricia Altschul from Southern Charm. 

One fan joked she would 'watch every second of that' with Altschul, 79, quick to write: 'Yep… it was me !!'

Receipts: On Wednesday's season finale, Lisa whipped out a host of printed text messages between Glanville and Richards to try and prove their relationship was more than just friendly

Rinna was head of the pack in questioning Denise Richards for having an affair with Brandi Glanville and trying to keep it a secret from the girls and viewers at home.

On Wednesday's season finale, Lisa whipped out a host of printed text messages between Glanville and Richards to try and prove their relationship was more than just friendly. 

Denise answered back to her former friend of two decades: 'You better be careful saying this because yours will be shown too.'

Cheating allegations were first brought to light five years ago during a feud in Amsterdam when former housewife Kim Richards attempted to expose an affair involving Harry Hamlin when, during a volatile fight, Kim said: 'Let’s not talk about the husband.' 

Harry and Lisa have been married for more than 20 years and have two children together: Delilah, 22, and Amelia, 19.
