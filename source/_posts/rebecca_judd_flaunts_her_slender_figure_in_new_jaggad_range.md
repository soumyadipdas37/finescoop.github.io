Footy WAG Rebecca Judd is an entrepreneurial powerhouse. 

And the 37-year-old JAGGAD founder proved to be her own best advertisement while promoting the new range from the brand on Monday. 

Taking to Instagram, Bec flaunted her endless pins as she did a number of twists and turns standing in front of a mirror.

Bec flaunted her toned midriff as she showed off her seamed, high-waisted black pants. 

'You can wear them for your active activities or dress them up and wear them with something cropped or tucked in,' she said. 

Bec proved they were suitable for daytime or night-time wear. The model later showed the pants with a knotted top and sneakers.

Earlier this month, Bec joked that she could not tell her children apart.

In a post shared to Instagram, Bec paid homage to her husband Chris on Father's Day by sharing a picture of the doting dad bathing one of the pair's four children as a baby. 

She captioned the image: 'Happy Father's Day baby daddy. No idea who you're bathing here but you're nailing it as always'.

She also shared a photo of the whole family together, captioning it: 'Our king. Our hero. Our superman. Love you'. 

Rebecca and Chris have been married for 10 years and share four young children together. 

The couple are parents to son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins Tom and Darcy, both aged three.
