British Airways owner IAG yesterday revealed it is laying off up to 13,000 staff 

Thousands of British Airways cabin crew face a crunch vote in the coming days over whether to accept pay cuts to help the airline survive the Covid-19 crisis.

BA owner IAG yesterday revealed it is laying off up to 13,000 staff – 1,000 more than it had warned of previously. 

It said that 8,236 jobs have already been cut at the carrier, with around 6,500 taking voluntary redundancy.

BA has been locked in a bitter dispute with Unite over plans to cut pay and perks for staff ranging from cabin crew to engineers and customer services staff at check-in desks.

IAG revealed it had finally made a breakthrough with Unite, reaching an agreement in principle over pay cuts for longer-serving cabin crew.

This will be put to a ballot in the coming days, with cabin crew asked to vote on whether to accept the offer or not.
