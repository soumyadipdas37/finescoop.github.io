It is the chilling new horror-tinged show from the mind of Ryan Murphy, set to air on Netflix next week.

Judging by the final trailer for Ratched, starring one of Murphy's favourite actors Sarah Paulson, the latest series could be his most terrifying to date.

'Looking good today, Mildred,' Sarah, 45, is seen telling her reflection in the mirror, as she plays the titular Nurse Ratched, based on the character in the 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey.

According to Netflix, Ratched is a suspenseful drama series that tells the origin story of asylum nurse and infamous villain Mildred Ratched. 

In 1947, Mildred arrives in Northern California to seek employment at a leading psychiatric hospital where new and unsettling experiments have begun on the human mind. 

The new trailer sees more of Mildred's clandestine mission, as she begins work on a number of patients in an asylum.

Interestingly, the controversial character in the 1975 movie version starring Jack Nicholson was turned down by a number of leading ladies including Anne Bancroft, Angela Lansbury and Ellen Burstyn. 

The role in the film eventually went to Louise Fletcher, who went on to win the Oscar for Best Actress for the turn.
