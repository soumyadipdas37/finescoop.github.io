The highly-rated Sharman-Lowe has hailed Burton for the club's role in his progression through their ranks and expressed delight with the move.

'It's brilliant and it has all happened so fast,' he said. 'Burton have developed me so well and now it's another new beginning and, hopefully, I can develop further with Chelsea.

'I'm excited to be joining such a great club, especially as they are known for bringing on young players.

'It has all happened in a flash, from playing for the first team in pre-season, and then joining a top four Premier League contender.

'I want to say a massive thank you to all the first team staff, Jake Buxton and the players and to Nigel Clough, Dan Robinson, Paul Reynolds, Sam Rose and all the Academy staff for all their help and support.

'I just want to continue training with that support, develop as a player, get a few games and see how it pans out.'

Chelsea head of recruitment Petr Cech was invited to watch Sharman-Lowe play during the off-season, and the amicable arrangement was quickly thrashed out between both parties.¬†

Burton boss Jake Buxton said: 'We had a conversation with Teddy and his parents and said if he can stay with us and develop that would be great, and he's proved he's more than capable of being an important part of the goalkeeping mix here this season.'¬†

Frank Lampard has signed an array of superstars this summer, with Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech - but appears to also have one eye on the future with the addition of Sharman-Lowe.
