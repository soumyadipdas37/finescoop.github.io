Marion Cotillard has revealed that she found lockdown 'very interesting' as she felt 'connected' to the rest of the world.

The French star, 44, has spoke about the global pandemic and her acting career in a new interview for the October issue of Harper's Bazaar.

Talking about the lessons she has learnt during lockdown, Marion told the publication: 'I found this period very interesting. For everybody to be locked down, and for time to stop, I found something of a relief.

'I felt really connected to the rest of the world, and I think many human beings felt that way. No FOMO any more! But I also had a lot of thoughts about the world, about what's going on socially and environmentally.'

Marion was feeling reflective as she also discussed her recent Antarctic voyage as part of being a Greenpeace Ocean Ambassador in January.

The movie star was joined by Vikings star Gustaf Skarsgård and The Flowers of War actress Ni Ni for the trip of a lifetime where they researched climate change and marine life.

Talking about the experience, she said: 'It's definitely one of the most beautiful places I've seen in my life. It's almost untouched; its energy is really fed by the fact that you can't buy anything, you can't sell anything.

'But we saw a decreasing population of penguins, and plastics in a place where no man goes, so that was very disturbing. 

'The whole trip, from pole to pole, was to try to open the public's eyes to what could happen if we don't set rules for these places.'

Marion noted that just weeks after the trip, the Covid-19 crisis happened, she added: 'We were there to draw attention to this project. And I came back and then it was just a couple of weeks to a different crisis.'

The award-winning star, who won an Oscar for her role in La Vie en Rose, also discussed her acting career.

Lockdown: Talking about the lessons she has learnt during lockdown, Marion told the publication: 'I found this period very interesting. For everybody to be locked down, and for time to stop, I found something of a relief.' 

Marion revealed she started acting from a young age and it was something that was 'really strong' inside her.

She said: 'I was just fascinated by my parents' life. There was a lot of energy in the house, and then I started to have my own experience of acting. Right away I felt it was something that was really strong in me. 

'The first time was in a summer camp. I did this play at the end, and I felt something that shook me. 

'I was playing an old housekeeper and the reaction of the audience, people laughing, and then coming up to me afterwards... That was the first time I felt it would be my life.'

As well as her interview, Marion posed for a collection of stunning photos as part of a photoshoot.

For her cover, the actress looked ethereal in a strapless black gown with long puffed arm gloves and a stunning gold chain waist belt.

In a different photo from the interview, Marion showcased her toned figure in a pair of black shorts.

She teamed the item of clothing with a structured white cropped shirt which had  ruffled detailing on it.

Marion has starred in several huge blockbuster films, including the likes of Inception with Leonardo DiCaprio and Allied with Brad Pitt.

In her personal life, the star is loved-up with longterm partner and French actor Guillaume Canet. They have been dating since 2007.
