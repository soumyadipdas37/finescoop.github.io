She's the former makeup artist and Married At First Sight star who filled in for Jackie O on Thursday, on her KIIS FM radio show. 

And after getting some positive feedback from fans, it seems that Martha Kalifatidis could very much consider a career change and go into radio. 

One listener of the Kyle and Jackie O Show said that the 31-year-old reality TV star 'was as good or if not better than when Jackie is there.'

'Whilst I am not a huge fan of Martha. The show ran smoothly today and was as good or if not better than when Jackie is there,' one follower tweeted.  

They added: 'Time to save a few million per year and replace Jackie with Mayo or something,' referring to producer Jaimee Hassos.

'She talks more than Jackie, which isn't difficult,' they finished.

Martha stepped in to host The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday, after Jackie O called in sick.  

Jackie, 45, had taken the day off due to exhaustion, having pulled an all-nighter on Tuesday filming the finale of The Masked Singer followed by her KIIS FM breakfast show the next morning.

Martha was an eleventh-hour replacement after usual fill-in host Beau Ryan was unavailable.

Martha, 30, was one of the breakout stars from Married At First Sight's sixth season in 2019, and is still dating her 'husband' Michael Brunelli.

While on air, Martha made a number of candid confessions, including that she's constantly inundated with unsolicited d**k pics from her Instagram followers.

The brunette also confirmed her secret split with Michael that happened 'for a few hours.'

She said that they didn't even spend any time apart during the split because they were still stuck in the same house together.
