If these astonishing photographs are anything to go by, even the most famous of faces aren't as unique as they'd probably like to be. 

Same de la Same Instagram account, created by Israel-based Freddy Slivinski, shares snaps of people who closely resemble pop stars, actors and even well-known artists such as Vincent van Gogh.

Images include one of Copenhagen-based content creator Sonja Lovdal, who says she is often mistaken for Games of Thrones star Maisie Williams, as well as British student Ella Norton, who says it's a 'lovely compliment to be compared to Emma Watson'.

The photographs were collated by Bored Panda and also show an American Mariah Carey lookalike who says she is regularly stopped for selfies while shopping at her local supermarkets.
