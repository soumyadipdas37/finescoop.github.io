She confirmed her romance with Brandon Myers last month, when the new couple were spotted enjoying night out together in London.

But Gabby Allen was focused on another man in her life on Sunday, when she shared a throwback snap of herself with pal Lyle Whittaker to celebrate his 30th birthday.

The Love Island star, 28, looked sensational in a skimpy green bikini as she posed alongside shirtless Lyle during one of their recent sunny getaways together.

Further glamming up her look with a selection of statement jewellery, the reality star was also seen playfully hugging her friend as they stood in a sparkling pool.

Captioning the images, she wrote: 'Wishing the happiest of 30th birthdays to my partner in crime ❤️ my mentor (sorry I never listen to you) my hairdresser, my go to plus 1 and my friend for eternity!

'Thank you for being such an amazing friend to me over the years, I don’t know what I would’ve done without you.

'Thanks for always being there for me at a drop of a hat, for listening to me and mostly helping me create some AMAZING memories! Here’s to many, MANY more.❤️'

Her post comes weeks after she was spotted enjoying a romantic night on the town with Ex On The Beach hunk Brandon Myers, 23, at Harry's Bar in London.

They've since been seen looking loved up on each other's Instagram accounts.

Only recently, the reality star shared a Q&A to her Instagram stories in which she revealed how her relationship with the Ex On The Beach hunk 'puts everything into perspective'.

Gabby was asked: 'How did you know you were ready for another relationship after your last one?'

The reality star responded: 'I didn't. It was a slow burner. But this is VERY different to any relationship I've been in before.

'It puts most of my others to shame and I can't believe what I put up with to how well I am respected and how loved I feel now.

'It puts everything into perspective when someone treats you right.'

In June, Gabby insisted her fellow reality star was a 'really good friend' but nothing more following relationship speculation. 

They were first reported to be dating in May, when he posted a flirty comment under one of her scantily-clad bikini snaps.

But the fitness enthusiast insisted they are little more than close friends, telling OK!: 'No. We've known each other for a long time. He's the loveliest person and a really good friend of mine, but that's all it is.

'Someone must have seen him comment on a picture on my social media, and automatically assumed he's my boyfriend.'

Meanwhile her ex-boyfriend Marcel Somerville revealed that he is expecting his first child with his influencer partner Rebecca Vieira, and he recently announced that they have become engaged.

Marcel and Gabby appeared on the 2017 season of the ITV2 dating show Love Island, in which they placed fourth, but she dumped him in February 2018 when she discovered he'd been unfaithful.

Gabby also previously dated Rak-Su star Myles Stephenson until August 2019, when she accused him of cheating on her.
