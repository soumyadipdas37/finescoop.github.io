Lil Nas X said: 'What I love about this collection is not only are the clothes super sick and show-stopping, but I m also really proud of what it represents and all the people that it will help. 

'Atlanta is my hometown and the LGBTQ+ community is some of the most at risk, so I'm glad that we'll be able to offer them some support.'

It was also announced that 100% of proceeds from sales of merchandise from the collection would be donated to a new fund at the Loveland Foundation that benefits the young Black queer community in Atlanta.
