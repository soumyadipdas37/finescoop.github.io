A day at the beach became a family affair as Alec and Hilaria Baldwin made their first public appearance with newborn son Eduardo on Sunday. 

Hilaria, 36, cradled the child - her fifth with Hollywood star Alec - as the couple ventured out for a coastal stroll in exclusive New York enclave The Hamptons. 

The proud parents were accompanied by daughter Carmen, 13, and their three elder sons, Rafael, five, Leonardo, four, and two-year old Romeo while taking in their picturesque surroundings.

Alec and Hilaria welcomed Eduardo on September 7th after previously suffering two miscarriages while trying for a fifth child. 

Taking to Instagram shortly after the birth, Hilaria was seen holding the baby as she sat in her hospital bed with her 62-year-old husband by her side.

Captioning the snap, she wrote: 'We had a baby last night. He is perfect and we couldn’t be happier. Stay tuned for a name.'

All mine: Hilaria welcomed Eduardo on September 7th after previously suffering two miscarriages in her quest for a fifth child 

In 2019 Hilaria suffered two miscarriages as she tried to add to her family, both of which she candidly documented on social media in an attempt to normalize them for other women.

She and her Blue Jasmine actor husband wanted another daughter to their family after welcoming three boys and have publicly said they will continue trying until that happens.

Also in August, she revealed that her 'quarantine bubble' had thrown her a surprise baby shower.

'I can't believe that Alec didn't tell me... Because we all know that he can't keep secrets from me! So this was soooooo well done!' she wrote over an image of the Hollywood star with their kids and friends.
