Manchester United are reportedly set to table a take-it-or-leave-it £90million offer for Jadon Sancho.

United have been chasing Sancho all summer but have been unable to reach an agreement with Borussia Dormtund, who have remained firm on their £108m asking price for the forward.

But according to Mirror Sport, the Red Devils will issue a final offer of £75m up front with a further £15m in add-ons and claim Ed Woodward will inform the Bundesliga side there will be no negotiating over the fee or structure of the deal.

Ed Woodward will tell Borussia Dortmund the fee and payment structure is not negotiable 

United face a battle to get a deal done before the October 5 deadline with both the Premier League and Bundesliga seasons already underway.

The club made a breakthrough in talks over Sancho's wages and the agents' fees earlier this month but have so far been unable to bring down the price for the England international. 

Dortmund's director Sebastian Kehl said earlier this week that Sancho would not be sold in a cut-price deal.

Suggesting that United had made a bid in the region of £73million for the former Manchester City starlet, Kehl told Sport 1: 'We agreed that we had to show a certain attitude. And €80m are simply not enough for such a player. 

'We owed that to the club and the fans. I don't want to give him up either. Without Jadon this team is worse.'

Sancho has had a flying start to the season for the German side with a goal and two assists in their opening two fixtures.

In the 2019-2020 campaign, the forward contributed 20 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances as Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga.

United have alternative options but the 20-year-old is still their No1 target. The club are locked in negotiations with Porto over left back Alex Telles who is out of contract next summer.

They are hoping to bring down the Portuguese side's £17m asking price while holding out for an £18m bid from Roma for Chris Smalling - who is looking to seal a move back to the Serie A side.
