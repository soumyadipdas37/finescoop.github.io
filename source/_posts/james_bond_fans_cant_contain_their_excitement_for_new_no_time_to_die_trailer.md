Overjoyed James Bond fans have struggled to contain their enthusiasm following the release of a new trailer for No Time To Die.

Eager social media users flooded Twitter with memes to show their excitement after the clip's release yesterday. 

Well-known scenes - from Carlton dancing on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Homer Simpson squealing and Leonardo DiCaprio clapping in The Wolf Of Wall Street - were used by viewers too astounded for words. 

But some fans didn't tweet with as much delight after recalling that this film would mark Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond.

'Man, can’t believe this is Daniel Craig’s last Bond movie. He is by far my favourite Bond,' one upset social media user admitted.

Another wrote: 'Seeing this movie will be bittersweet knowing that it's Daniel's last turn as Bond. 

'What a fantastic job he has done and mark he has left on this awesome franchise. The only movie I will see in theaters this year will be a James Bond movie.'

A third added: 'I had not too much of an issue with the first trailer but I must say this here is the Craig-Bond I know. 

'Even if he looks as though he feels a little shaky, he's going out to save the world one last time with the same adrenaline first seen in Casino Royale.'

Another shared their excitement, saying: 'Whoa! Trailer was insane! This looks really good! There's so much action! 

'Seeing Bond reloading a machine gun in a tux is too cool! Very suave! The last outing for Daniel Craig is looking good!'

British actor Daniel, 52, looked as brooding as ever in the trailer, which sees him come to grips with villain Safin, portrayed by Rami Malek, 39, who viewers are told is concocting a plan that could kill 'millions'. 

The nail-biting video opens with 007 narrowly avoiding being hit by a car before smashing into a wall as he embarks on one of his most dangerous missions yet. 

Set to the iconic Bond theme song, fans are re-introduced to villain Blofeld, played by Christoph Waltz, who sits in a cage in a prison cell.

Fans of the franchise are also given a better look at CIA Agent Paloma (Ana De Armas) who Bond meets in Santiago, pictured left, as well as villain Safin, portrayed by Rami Malek, pictured right

He tells Bond: 'James, fate draws us back together and now your enemy is my enemy', with the nemesis in question being none other than Safin. 

Fans of the franchise are also given a better look at CIA Agent Paloma (Ana De Armas) who Bond meets in Santiago and '00' agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch).

In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20.

The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, was originally scheduled for release in April, but was pushed back to November 25 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was then brought forward to November 8 before the most recent change.
