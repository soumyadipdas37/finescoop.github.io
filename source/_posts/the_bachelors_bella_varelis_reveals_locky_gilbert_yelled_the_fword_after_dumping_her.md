Bella Varelis has revealed the bizarre moment that didn't make it to air on Thursday night's finale of The Bachelor.

The marketing consultant, 25, told Pedestrian, Locky Gilbert, 30, yelled the F-word as she walked to the car after he dumped her.

'He just let me walk off but I did actually hear him scream, "f**k" as I was walking off, halfway up the driveway,' she told the publication. 

Moment: The Bachelor's Bella Varelis (pictured) revealed a frustrated Locky Gilbert 'YELLED the F-word after dumping her' in bizarre scenes they couldn't air on TV 

She went on to say:'He screamed "f**k" at the top of his lungs and I did't turn around. I remember my producer looking at me and I was just like "don't".'

'I just wanted to get into the car. Once the door closed and it was all over I just cried,' she said.

Bella revealed that was the final goodbye and it was the last time she spoke or even saw Locky.

She said: 'Locky (pictured) just let me walk off but I did actually hear him scream, "f**k" as I was walking off, halfway up the driveway'

During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told Bella and Irena Srbinovska he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home. 

He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.

'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'

As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave? I'm going.'

She later told producers: 'Who does that to someone? Who tells them they're in love with them and then... I just want to get out of here.' 

After this emotional break-up, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena, telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.

And the winner is... Irena! After this emotional break-up, Locky professed his love for Irena Srbinovska, telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her
