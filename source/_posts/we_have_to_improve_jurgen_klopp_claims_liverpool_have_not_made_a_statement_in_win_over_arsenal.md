Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp dismissed suggestions his side had sent out a statement with their 3-1 win over Arsenal at Anfield.

Sadio Mane, Andy Robertson and Diogo Jota, on his home debut, all scored after Alexandre Lacazette had been gifted the opener following a Robertson error to make it 61 home league matches unbeaten - just two short of the club record set between 1978-81.

Jota's late strike made it 400 goals in 185 league matches for Klopp, faster than any other Liverpool manager, and they should have probably had more.

'We don't make statements - in press conferences from time to time I have to do it because you ask questions,' said Klopp. 'We have to improve. We have to become consistent. So far we have played quite well but that's all.

'It was good, a really good game, I pretty much loved each second - I didn't like the goal we conceded but the reaction I liked a lot.

'Against a top team in form, playing like we did tonight, it is really something to be honest. We were dominant, played good football, were difficult to defend against, played some really good stuff.

'Arsenal had not too many but some chances because they have real quality, I think most of their chances were offside but Ali (Becker) made a save any way. It was a really good performance.'

Had Lacazette been sharper in front of goal he could have made it 2-2 in a one-on-one with Alisson and when he was substituted 15 minutes from time he covered his face with shirt as he sat down on the bench.

The French striker fired straight at Alisson with a golden chance to make it 2-2 late on

'Obviously he had the best chance in the game to make it 2-2, and then again put us in a really strong position, but he had a great game,' said the Spaniard.

'He put in another incredible performance and I'm pleased with him. I want to see my players upset and angry when we lose a game.

'It is a really tough place to come, they are a really good side. We stayed in the game for almost the whole match.Â 

Lacazette had given Arsenal the lead earlier in the match despite Liverpool's dominance

'Having took the lead we should have held that situation a bit better. We conceded the goal too early.

'We competed well knowing the difficult moments you will have when you come to Anfield; when we had the clear chances to make it 2-2 we didn't take them.

'They want to win and this is what they are like, the mindset of the team. They go to any ground and want to win. They really believed we could come here and do it and for large periods of the game we were there.'
