NRL star Josh Reynolds' ex-girlfriend Arabella Del Busso has spoken about her desire to fall in love.

The 30-year-old model told The Daily Telegraph on Thursday, she would like to find her perfect match and start a family of her own. 

'I want to find love and I want to settle down and have kids and have my own family,' she said.

Arabella was accused of faking a pregnancy during her tumultuous relationship with the NRL star.

She said: 'I didn't have that as a child so I want to give my kids something that I never had in life.'

Arabella's interview comes after it was announced she will be appearing on Channel Seven's upcoming series SAS Australia.

The military-style show will see the contestants having to endure sleep deprivation, interrogation techniques and physical challenges.

The lingerie model will be joined by a growing list of celebrities including convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby and publicist Roxy Jacenko.

Filming for SAS Australia begun earlier this year in Queenstown, New Zealand, but production was relocated to the NSW Snowy Mountains due to travel restrictions being enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Arabella last appeared on television in May, when she addressed her bitter split with Josh on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes.

During the interview, Arabella tearfully denied faking pregnancies and miscarriages during her tumultuous relationship with the footy star.

However, she did admit to passing off another woman's ultrasound scan as her own in order to 'spite' her then-boyfriend.
