Cardi B took to Instagram on Sunday evening after her sister Hennessy Carolina, 24, was allegedly harassed by a group of 'racist [MAGA] supporters' over a parking space.

The 27-year-old rapper shared footage of the altercation with her 75million followers and directly called out Donald Trump for fueling the alleged aggressors with his rhetoric. 

'Meanwhile not only you got racist [MAGA] supporters that are [lynching] ,racist cop shootings and killing black men all cause their leader make them feel like they could do so,' claimed Cardi B in her post's caption.

'My sister couldn't even park her car today with out this man harassing her girlfriend soon as the camera cane out they started being sweet .TGIS BRAVENESS IS COMING FROM THEIR LEADERS ENERGY'  

The expletive-riddled footage showed two men - one donning a 'Make America Great Again' cap - and one woman engaging in a heated back-and-forth with Hennessy at a beach. 

'Get your vehicle out of here,' demanded one of the alleged aggressors, to which Hennessy hastily replied: 'Get the f**k out of my face!'

'Ok, don't EVER come to a female [unintelligible] while I'm not here,' shouted Hennessy, who was referencing to her girlfriend.

One man in the video, who was shirtless, insisted that he 'did not come near [Hennessy]' as he continued to remain uncomfortably close to her and her parked vehicle. 

Hennessy shouted numerous times for the two men to 'back the f**k off [her] car,' which, oddly, prompts the female member of the group to approach her.

Hennessy and the woman engaged in a close shouting match for a few seconds, before the woman began slowly retreating.

'You're blocking some people,' she exclaimed, to which Hennessy replied: 'I hope you know that you will be online and your husband.'

The woman flashed her middle finger at Hennessy's camera and then began chanting 'Trump' over and over again.

Before the video cut-off, Hennessy briefly focused the camera on herself as she breathed heavily with rage.  

Hennessy, who boasts 6.8million followers, shared the entire video of the explosive interaction on her Instagram Story, which her sister Cardi B later reposted.

She returned to Instagram after the altercation gained traction online to express how 'sad and angry' she still was over the 'racism' she allegedly experienced.

'This f**king racism and police brutality still going on in 2020 is f**king insane!!!!' she wrote in.

She marveled at the fact that people in the United States 'are dead out here being proud and racist harassing people while wearing they MAGA hat like if they know the government going to hold them down is ridiculous!'

Hennessy concluded her lengthy Instagram Story post by saying: 'F**k Donald Trump [and] suck my d**k if you support that n***a and you racist [as f**k].'

In a follow up post, she took the time to thank those that have voiced their support towards her and she mirrored her sister's sentiments about Donald Trump's rhetoric.

'I can't believe [the people in the video] are openly harassing a lesbian and being racist while wearing a Maga hat literally super confident knowing the president is permitting and encouraging them to yell at people 'go back to your country'' one portion of Hennessy's comment read.

She then accused Instagram and Facebook of purposely 'shadow banning' her on their platforms for speaking out about Trump.

Cardi B has vocalized her support for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden over the past few months, even interviewing the 77-year-old politician for ELLE in August.

The Grammy Award-winning rapper has also continuously used her massive social media platform to encourage people to register and vote in the upcoming election. 

During her conversation with Biden, Cardi listed what she 'wants the next president to do for [the country]' but that her number one priority is getting 'Trump out.'

'His mouth gets us in trouble so much. I don't want to be lied to -- we're dealing with a pandemic right now and I just want answers,' expressed the rapper passionately. 

After the interview, Cardi B told ELLE that that she wants 'a president who makes me feel secure' and a president 'understands the pain of the people.'

She added: 'I want a president who is going to give us answers.' 

'Those people that [Donald Trump] caters [to], he's not going to do anything for them. It's not like Republicans are getting better housing. It's not like Republicans are getting better benefits. They're not. He's not doing anything for anybody. He's just saying things that appease the same people,' she said.
