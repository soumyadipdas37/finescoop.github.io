Tristan Thompson looked every inch the doting boyfriend and father, as he picked up breakfast for her girlfriend Khloé Kardashian and their little girl in Calabasas. 

The 29-year-old NBA star was seen picking up takeout, at Lovi's Deli, in a pair of bright red Nike shorts and a black t-shirt on Sunday.

He dutifully wore a black facial covering, in accordance with Los Angeles' mask mandate in in high-risk settings, amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The Cleveland Cavaliers player, who is the father of Kardashian's two-year-old True, looked at ease, as he slid back into the driver's seat with a single plastic bag.  

The pair are rumored to have recently rekindled their romance, but a source recently told Us Weekly she 'doesn't really care' what people think of her love life.  

After a tumultuous on-again-off-again relationship, Khloé and Tristan previously called it quits after his 2019 cheating scandal with Jordyn Woods.

In August, a source told People, 'She loves having him around. He has the best relationship with True, and he has been amazing to Khloé too. They are very much together and Khloé is beyond happy.'

'They have been living in kind of a bubble and Khloé enjoys it,' the source added.

The insider also claimed that she was 'beyond happy' and hoped 'that Tristan has changed.'

'So many people don't understand it, but I lead with love and we put our child first,' she told People in July. 'If you have that mindset, everything else follows easily. We have a family together.'

She added: 'Tristan and I needed that time to heal and I needed time to go through my emotions. But now he's literally one of my best friends.'

Khloé weathered Tristan's first cheating scandal in 2018, two days before she gave birth to True.

Dailymail.com published images of Tristan getting close to a woman at New York nightclub as well as old surveillance footage of him and two women at a lounge in Washington DC.

The duo worked on their relationship and didn't break up until February 2019, when Tristan was caught kissing Jordyn at his home after a party.

DailyMailTV revealed at the time that in addition to the Jordyn incident, Tristan was seen sneaking two women into a bedroom at a late night 'singles' party on Valentine's Day. He was still with Khloé at the time.

Khloé and Tristan first began dating in September 2016 following her divorce from Lamar Odom; she moved to Cleveland to live with NBA player in December 2017 after announcing her pregnancy.
