With the coronavirus pandemic temporarily shutting down production on The Block, contestant Harry Pavlou was busted sneaking back onto the building site.

The 57-year-old was caught on CCTV walking back into his renovated home three weeks into the show's mandatory lockdown during Wednesday's episode.

According to host Scott Cam, the show's resident larrikin was caught 'sneaking back on The Block to do a little measuring up'.

Harry's presence on the building site during lockdown left the show's other contestants feeling annoyed.

'For him to come on site and be able to measure things, possibly change things to advance himself. I think we were all a bit dirty,' admitted Jimmy, 33.

Later in the episode, Harry again raised eyebrows among his fellow contestants, when he brought his own spray paint gun from home.

A producer then asked Harry if he was allowed to use the spray gun given that it was his own.

'There were no rules that said you couldn't bring your own tools,' he insisted, before adding that he'd decided to 'just do it'.

But Harry maintained that the other contestants were 'not too concerned' about his behaviour, despite landing himself the nickname 'Dirty Harry'.

'I don't know if it's in the rules. Dirty Harry doesn't have rules. He makes the rules,' said Tam (right, pictured with husband Jimmy)

'I don't know if it's in the rules. Dirty Harry doesn't have rules. He makes the rules,' said Tam, 31.

She later added: 'Dirty Harry. He's got a new name around the site, ol' Dirty Harry. He's a sneaky, sneaky, sneaky man.'  

But Harry insisted that he hadn't done anything wrong, despite the fact the show's other contestants were gossiping about his 'sneaky' ways.
