Joseph Baena shared an image of himself Tuesday on social media flexing in 100-degree heat as he channeled his bodybuilder father Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The 22-year-old son of Arnold, 73, posed shirtless on Instagram with his arms up and biceps bulging as the temperature hit triple digits in Bakersfield, California.

Joseph was the spitting image of his father who in 1967 won the Mr. Universe at age 20.

He wore black shorts and was clean shaven while posing in front of a gym mirror.

Joseph and Arnold were spotted Monday morning riding bikes together in Santa Monica, California.

The two often team up for workouts in the Venice and Santa Monica area including weightlifting routines.

Joseph's mother, Mildred Baena, was the Schwarzenegger's family housekeeper when she had an affair with the legendary action star.

The illicit relationship and secret son was revealed in a bombshell article by the Los Angeles Times just four months after the end of Arnold's term as Governor of California.

As a result of the scandal, Arnold's wife Maria Shriver, 64, moved out of the family home in the Brentwood area Los Angeles, and the couple confirmed their 25-year marriage was over.

Arnold and Maria reunited Monday night to celebrate the 23rd birthday of their son Christopher Schwarzenegger.

Christopher sported a beaming smile as he sat beside his famous father Arnold, while his mother Maria, and siblings Patrick, 27, and Christina, 29, stood behind.

The sweet family snap was taken in a back garden as the family enjoyed a small celebration for Christopher.

Arnold aslo commemorated the milestone by sharing a montage of snaps of his son and a touching message about how proud he is of his child.

He wrote: 'Happy birthday Christopher! You are such a fantastic son - kind, smart, giving, and everything I could ask for. I can't wait to see what you do with this year, but I know I'll be proud watching! I love you!'

Christopher celebrated his graduation from the University of Michigan back in May.
