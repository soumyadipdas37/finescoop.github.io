Jo Konta will tackle Heather Watson in the US Open first round today and will be hoping it is a happier experience than when she last found herself up against compatriots.

The British No 1 goes into the match confirming that she was disappointed by some of the antics that went on at the 'Battle of the Brits' team event at Roehampton a month ago.

The seven-day tournament concluded with a presentation at which a lifesize cardboard cutout was paraded of Konta. She was absent on the final day as she preferred to concentrate on her training for upcoming events in America.

Liam Broady seemed to have unearthed it, and its appearance caused much mirth among other players and coaches. Konta feels she was the victim of a misunderstanding and was left somewhat unamused to hear about the japes.

'It's kind of a decision and choice they made and I think it reflects more on them than me,' she said curtly, as she prepared to meet Britain's No 2, who was on opposite sides for the Jamie Murray-organised event.

As Sportsmail revealed last week, Konta had been unhappy at being viewed as being semi-detached from the team aspect of the tournament and felt that some of the barracking from the sidelines was over the top for a behind-closed-doors exhibition.

She explained she had made only a limited commitment to an event that became progressively more competitive as the week went on. 'When I went into the 'Brits' my understanding, and my agreement with Jamie, was that I was only ever meant to play two matches,' she said.

'So there was never any talk of the kind of events like Fed Cup, where you should be present at the side of the court, there was none of that.

'I had scheduled my training accordingly and so I was training, that's why I wasn't there. Obviously the nature of the event changed as the days went on and people took it more seriously.

'The way I approached it stayed very much the same from the beginning to the end. I think some people may have misunderstood that, or interpreted it as not supporting.Â 

'But no one really knew because no one asked me, and Jamie never told anyone I was only contracted to play two matches.'

While there is no doubt that Konta is not as clubbable as some other British players, her discontent at being mocked is understandable. In an individual sport, she has always done things in her own way and there can be no arguments it has worked for her.

Through her unstinting professionalism she has established herself as the country's best female, and last year reached two Grand Slam quarter-finals and a semi-final.

Many other GB players ought to look upon her as a role model to be admired rather than any figure of fun.

Any ill-feeling stemming from the 'Battle of the Brits' does not extend to Watson, the world No 54, who Konta did not face in her two Roehampton matches.

'We get on well, we have always got on well during Fed Cup matches and we always have a good chat when we are at the National Tennis Centre as well,' said Konta. 'I'd say she is one of the girls I am closer to out of those at home.

'There is always going to be an added element because it's two Brits playing each other and there will be more interest in the UK but we are both just going to do the best we can.'

With Konta having won all three previous meetings, and backed up by the memory of her run to the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows a year ago - usually supported in her guest box by actor Tom Hiddleston back then - she starts as clear favourite.
