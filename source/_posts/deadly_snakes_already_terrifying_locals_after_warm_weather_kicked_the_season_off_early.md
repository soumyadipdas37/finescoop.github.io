Australians have been warned to watch out for snakes as the weather warms up and snake season kicks in.

New South Wales has already seen snakes spotted through the state, after the reptiles were encouraged out of their winter brumation due to a warm start to spring.

Brandon Gifford, a reptile keeper from the Australian Reptile Park, said there was no better time than now to brush up on snake-related first aid.

'We are putting out an urgent warning to all Australians that the weather is warming up and the snakes are on the move,' Mr Gifford said.

'They're breeding, they're feeding and they're ready to go.'

Brandon Gifford, a reptile keeper from the Australian Reptile Park, said there was no better time than now to brush up on snake-related first aid

He said there were 3,000 snake bites in Australia every year, with only 300 people needing anti-venom.

One or two bites every year are fatal.  

'It's important that all Australians know our slithery friends do not go out of their way to harm humans,' Mr Gifford said.

'Snake bites mostly occur when people are trying to catch or kill the snake, so if you don't do either of those things you drastically reduce your chances of having a negative encounter with one of Australia's venomous snakes.'

Most people are bitten by snakes when deliberately trying to catch them and by not doing this, it drastically reduces the risk. 

Mr Gifford said people should make their backyards as unappealing as possible to snakes.

This can be done by keeping the lawns mowed and not leaving items such as piles of timber and household refuse around. 

Mr Gifford said it is important to stay calm if a snake comes into your yard or home.

He said if you come across one, you should always contact a local snake catcher rather than trying to remove it yourself.

Mr Gifford said if you are bitten by a snake, it is important to act as though it is venomous even if many bites are not.

He said you need to grab something that will put pressure on the wound - such as a piece of clothing or bandage - and wrap the bite four times.

Mr Gifford said the entire limb needs to be tightly wrapped, and the patient needs to be kept calm, so as to reduce blood flow.

However, some circulation must be allowed and it is important to try and mark the bite site.

Mr Gifford said once this is done, the victim should get to the nearest hospital as soon as possible.
