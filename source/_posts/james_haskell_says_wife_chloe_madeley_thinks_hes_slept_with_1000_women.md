James Haskell has revealed his wife Chloe Madeley thinks he's 'slept with 1,000 women' in the past.

In a new interview, the former rugby union player, 35, admitted he said 'the standard response of 12' when the personal trainer, 33, asked about his sexual history and insisted he 'didn't need to go into details' about his past.

The I'm A Celebrity star also shared that the couple, who will celebrate their second wedding anniversary in December, will try for a baby 'once they have a settled income stream'.

James said: 'Chloe claims that I've slept with 1,000 women. My wife and I did the numbers game and I was having absolutely no part in it. 

'Instead I said the standard response of 12 — no more, and no less. All that stuff, it's completely irrelevant. Do I need to go into the minutiae of details of the past? No. 

'Chloe and I have a relationship of trust. Though Chloe also claims every time she goes to the gym I watch porn... [but] whenever she goes to type in YouTube on her phone it comes up YouPorn.'

Speaking to Radio Times, she said: 'I was accused of nepotism because I was Richard and Judy's daughter. It was true, therefore it hurt. Now I've built up my own thing, I feel a lot stronger.'

The blonde got her start in TV as a roaming reporter on shows that her parents presented and later appeared as a contestant on Dancing on Ice in 2011.

She later became a contestant on The Jump and has also regularly appeared on the small screen for her work in the fitness industry.
