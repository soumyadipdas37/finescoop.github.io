TUNA NICOISE WITH CHARRED FENNEL 

Tuna nicoise with charred fennel will serve four people as a starter

Serves 2, or 4 as a starter

For the dressing  

You can use salmon or chicken instead of the tuna, if you prefer. 

Just griddle as in the recipe until cooked through. The sliced fennel can also be roasted in a moderate oven for 20 minutes.

Mix together the lemon zest, crushed garlic and fennel seeds. Pour over the tuna in a bowl, rub in and pop into the fridge to marinate for a few hours if you have the time.

In a food processor, whizz the dressing ingredients together until smooth. Season and set aside.

Slice the fennel bulb, add 1tbsp of oil and season. Heat a griddle pan and griddle the fennel until softened and lightly charred. Remove to a plate. 

In the same pan, add 1tbsp oil, and make sure the griddle is really hot. Cook the tuna for 1-2 minutes on both sides. Set aside to rest.

Cook the potatoes and beans in two pans of boiling water for 6-8 minutes, until tender. Drain the potatoes and refresh the beans under cold running water.

Put the potatoes in a salad bowl, season and add a little oil and lemon juice. Add the leaves, beans, fennel and eggs. Flake the tuna all over and drizzle with the dressing.  



ROASTED VEG WITH HARISSA AND GRIDDLED HALLOUMI  

Roasted veg with harissa and griddled halloumi will serve four and takes 35 minutes to cook

Serves 4

Mix of veggies such as; 2 mixed sweet peppers, 1 large fennel bulb, 1 red onion

Use feta instead. Add in a can of drained chickpeas for the last 5 minutes of cooking would be a nice addition. 

Heat the oven 200c, gas 6, fan 180c. Chop all the veg into large bite size chunks. On a large tray spread out the peppers, fennel, and onion. 

These take longer to cook. Drizzle with 1 tbsp oil and roast 15 minutes.

Scatter over the courgette, tomatoes and garlic give everything a stir, squirt over the balsamic, drizzle over 1 more tbsp oil.

Mix together the harissa, lemon zest, juice, oil and honey. Pour half over the veggies. 

Put in the oven again to roast for a further 20 minutes until all is softened an beginning to caramelise around the edges.

Thickly slice the halloumi. Heat a griddle pan and when hot griddle until golden on both sides.

Drizzle the rest of the dressing over the veg and cheese. 

ROASTED CHICKEN WITH SLAW AND SPICY LIME DRESSING 

Roasted chicken with slaw and spicy lime dressing could be made vegetarian-friendly with tofu instead of chicken

Serves 2

For the dressing

For the salad

For the dressing, mix together the nut butter and 2tbsp water to make a paste. Stir in the other ingredients, adding lime zest and juice to taste.

Shred the cabbage and sweet pepper, then shave the carrots, courgette and the outside part of the cucumber with a potato peeler, and place all the veg in a large bowl. Shred half the mint and toss through.

Add the roasted chicken and the rest of the mint, and the chilli and spring onion, if liked. Top with the dressing and serve with lime wedges.

Cook's tip

Try adding marinated tofu instead of the chicken.
