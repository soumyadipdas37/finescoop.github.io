Fern Britton has suggested that it is 'easier to forgive your enemies than your friends' in a new cryptic post.

The former This Morning host, 62, posted the 'thought for the day' on Twitter on Saturday, eight months after announcing her split from husband Paul Vickery.

The short message also comes just three days after she shared another post about 'being used' and 'betrayed' on the social media site.

Cryptic: Fern Britton has suggested that it is 'easier to forgive your enemies than your friends' in a new online post, eight months after revealing she had split from her husband Paul Vickery (pictured together on This Morning in 2017)

On Saturday Fern tweeted: 'Thought for the day: it’s easier to forgive your enemies than it is to forgive your friends.'

Her message soon gained more than 800 likes, with many people commenting that forgiveness takes time and can effect trust.  

Fern confirmed that she had split from her chef husband of 20 years Paul, 59, who she met while she was presenting This Morning, back in January.  

Her fans also rallied on Wednesday when she  retweeted a cryptic social media post about 'betrayal, falling out and being used' and said the words 'fit so perfectly.' 

Thought for the day: Fern's tweet soon received more than 800 likes with many fans discussing how hard it is to forgive those close to you

Back then: The star met Phil while she was presenting This Morning and he was the show's chef (pictured on the ITV series in March 2019) 

It read: 'In life, you will fall out with people that you never thought you would. Get betrayed by people that you trusted with all your heart. 

'And get used by people you would do anything for. But life also has a beautiful side to it.  

'You will get loved by someone you never thought you would have. Form friendships with people that will establish more meaningful and stronger relationships. And overcome things you never thought you would get over.

'We all have chapters that end with people at some point in life. But take pride in knowing that the very best part of your book is being written.' 

The post in full: Fern shared the message and wrote: 'Whoever wrote this KNOWS ! Xx'

Fern then added: 'This fits so perfectly' as she shared the post once more 

Fern then added: 'Whoever wrote this KNOWS ! Xx.' 

Back in June, Fern spoke about her marriage to Phil breaking down on ITV's Lorraine, saying: 'Unfortunately, we fell apart!' 

The TV personality explained that she was trying to finish her book while everything in her personal life was going on, and confessed that she 'needed the rest' which was forced on her by lockdown.  

Fern explained: 'Unfortunately, Phil and I fell apart. And I had this book to write this book and get it out on the deadline. 

'And once all that was done, lockdown happened and it's like three months of - I needed that rest, you know?' 

Fern and Phil share daughter Winnie, 18, whilst the Ready Steady Cook presenter also has twins Harry and Jack, 26, and Grace, 23, with former husband Clive Jones.

Announcement: The couple shared matching statements on their Twitter pages to announce the end of their marriage as they thanked fans for their 'kindness and support'  

Fern spoke about learning to be single during the coronavirus lockdown.  

She said: 'We separated at the beginning of the year and fortunately it's all smooth. We just came to the end of the road, you know, which is sad. 

'So, I've been adjusting to life as just me to think about, and my two daughters happen to be here because they got stuck in lockdown, happily for me.

'It's a time for me to really adjust my existence, which on the one hand is really quite exciting, but you've also got to process it for a while.'  

The TV host also reflected on their former relationship in an interview with Weekend Magazine: 'We had a wonderful time. We were the best of friends. And I miss that friendship.' 

'There comes a point when the children are substantially off your hands and you look at each other and wonder where you're going to go from here.' 

'I don't want anyone. I can do it by myself. I don't feel lonely. I like my own company. I realised not long ago that I was married, on and off, for 33 years.'   

On Twitter in January, both Fern and Phil wrote matching statements which read: 'After more than 20 happy years together, [we] have decided to go our separate ways. We will always share a great friendship and our lovely children.

'We would appreciate it if our privacy is respected at this time. Thank you for your continued kindness and support. [sic]'

The couple tied the knot 20 years ago in 2000, after Fern had split from former husband Clive Jones in the same year following a 12-year marriage.  

The couple met on This Morning when Fern hosted the show alongside Philip Schofield - who now hosts with Holly Willoughby - and the star previously said she never thought she would find love again as a mother of three children.  

Honest: In June, Fern appeared on Lorraine where and spoke about the breakdown of her marriage to Phil
