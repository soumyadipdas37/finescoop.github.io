An Ohio woman has called police fearing a smoked turkey tail she bought from a local grocery store was actually a human penis. 

Lamia Singfield bought the mysterious-looking meat from an Akron Save A Lot last Monday, planning to make a turkey stew complete with beans, peppers and potatoes. 

But she was left shaken after taking a closer look at 'turkey tail', telling her Facebook friends that she believed it was a severed male appendage.   

'I know what this is,' she stated in a Facebook Live video filmed from her kitchen.  

Lamia Singfield of Akron, Ohio called police last Monday fearing a smoked turkey tail she bought from a local grocery store was actually a human penis

The mysterious looking piece of meat had Singfield so concerned that she called the cops. Police then contacted the medical examiner's office for a further investigation 

Singfield later checked her receipt and realized she had accidentally purchased a 'smoked pork tail' - but she still harbored concerns about the phallic piece of meat.  

The disturbed cook called the local police department to report her disturbing purchase and they called around to her home to investigate. 

'I hope it's not a human, because then somebody is missing something that they need or somebody might be dead,' she stated. 

'I just want answers.' 

A second video shared later the same evening showed the cops on the scene. 

'This is serious, I showed them and they were like 'This is somebody's penis!'' Singfield told her friends via Facebook Live.

'I have a human part in my house, and I could have got sick!'

Singfield added: 'They are calling the medical examiner out here right now, and the coroner, because somebody is missing they stuff. Save A Lot has got some explaining to do.'

Singfield's video showed the mystery meat on a plate placed on the hood of a police car as they waited for the examiner to arrive

Thankfully, the medical examiner put an end to the mystery when they confirmed that the item was pork. 

They noted that there was a bone in the piece of meat, meaning it was likely a pig's tail.  

Save A Lot issued a statement in response to the investigation, stating: 'At Save A Lot we have a long-held commitment to the highest standards in quality control and work in partnership with our vendors to ensure those standards are upheld.  

'Issues of quality receive the utmost priority and we take this matter very seriously. We can confirm that we have had no previous quality issues with this item and we have not been contacted by the customer in question or the local authorities regarding this incident. We will take the appropriate action at that time.'

Meanwhile, Singfield must is relieved that she didn't cook up a human appendage in a $50 pot she had just purchased from Bed, Bath & Beyond. 

The Akron local feared she may have had to throw out the pot, or hand it over to police as part of a criminal investigation. 

'I hope it's not a human, because then somebody is missing something that they need or somebody might be dead': Singfield was relieved that there was not a  sinister story behind the mysterious looking meat
