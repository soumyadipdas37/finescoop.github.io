An accused paedophile dragged out of his house in a dawn raid allegedly drugged at least one child and raped them four times.

The 41-year-old was one of 18 people, including 11 alleged paedophiles, arrested in a police operation against online predators.

The alleged paedophile ring is accused of using Facebook and Instagram to groom 140 teenagers, aged as young as 13, across Perth - 23 of whom were allegedly abused.

The 41-year-old, who has a long criminal history but no other previous sex charges, first faced Fremantle Magistrates' Court on July 1 on 14 charges.

At least 11 people have been arrested (pictured) after WA Police launched a four-month-long investigation into an alleged paedophile ring grooming teenagers through social media

His alleged crimes includes four counts of rape, one count of sexual penetration of a child between 13 and 16, and one of indecent assault.

Two other charges allege he administered drugs to procure unlawful sex, and another two that he encouraged a child aged 13 to 16 to engage in sexual activity.

There were also three possession of stolen property charges and one drug charge.

Police on the weekend released footage of the man's arrest at his home on Hossack Avenue in Parkwood, in Perth's south.

He is the oldest of the people aged 18 to 41 who have so far been charged in Operation Timing Belt, aiming to smash alleged paedophile rings in Perth.   

Detectives from the sex offender management squad launched the operation in April, resulting in 79 sexual offence charges being laid.   

The alleged predators (WA Police raid pictured) are accused of utilising popular social media apps like Facebook and Instagram to contact their victims

The operation identified 140 teenagers aged between 13 and 19 who were targeted by the group, and 23 of them were found to be victims of sexual abuse.  

WA Police said some of the accused offenders would compare information about their victims and share the targets. 

Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Matt Daly said the accused predators allegedly contacted the teenagers through social media to 'ultimately engage in sexual contact with them'. 

'The majority of offences are non-physical communication via popular social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, and via mobile phones,' he explained.    

WA Police also confiscated computer equipment in connection with the alleged abuse as part of the series of raids. 

At least 18 accused people have been arrested and charged as part of the police operation

In all, 18 offenders had been charged as part of Operation Timing Belt, with 135 charges laid for non-sexual offences including drug, trespass and animal cruelty offences.   

State Crime Assistant Commissioner Brad Royce said Timing Belt showed that parents and children must be vigilant in terms of cyber safety.  

WA Police are continuing the investigation.
