COVID-19 has forced much of Hollywood into lockdown, putting productions on hold back in March.

Awards shows have been some of the first events to carry on with new precautions in place, amid the global pandemic.

And in another sign of the times, this weekend's 72nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards will feature presenters in full hazmat gear, personally delivering awards to winners' homes Sunday night.

Safety first: This weekend's 72nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards will feature presenters in full hazmat gear, personally delivering awards to winners' homes Sunday night.

A first look at the special gear reveals a typical black hazmat suit with an oversized black bowtie over a triangular patch of white dress shirt with white sleeve cuffs.

Costume designer Katja Cahill and executive producer Guy Carrington worked with a hazmat manufacturer on the custom look.

ABC (which airs the awards show) announced that hazmat-clad presenters 'may be visiting some of the winners live.'

For the first time, this year's show will be telecast from the homes of presenters, nominees and winners around the world.

Host Jimmy Kimmel will record live from Downtown Los Angeles, while producers have sent more than 150 video kits to other talent, for them to record from home. 

Executive producer Reggie Hudlin previously guaranteed an entertaining show, as the new format allows them to mix it up from previous years.

He told Variety: 'From category to category, it’s going to change throughout the broadcast. Some of them may not work, but we said, "Let's just experiment and have the audience a little more on the edge of their seats."'

Although Hudlin added that technical difficulties will likely arise, Kimmel is ready to keep us entertained: 'I think he’s hoping things go wrong.'

Star-studded event: Some of the confirmed talent includes Laverne Cox, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ilana Glazer, Abbi Jacobson, Randall Park, RuPaul Charles, Anthony Anderson, America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Gabrielle Union, Lena Waithe and Oprah Winfrey

But it mostly sounds like a chaotic adventure in store for viewers: 'If we’re in someone’s house and something extraordinary happens, why would you want to cut it off? 

'We’re thankful ABC understands our problem. It could come way under, it could go over. It might be on time. I think that’s unlikely.'

Two-time Grammy-winning artist H.E.R. has also been confirmed to perform during this year's 'In Memoriam' segment.
