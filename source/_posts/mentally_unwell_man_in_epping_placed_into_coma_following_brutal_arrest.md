A father-of-three living with bipolar disorder is in a coma after being rammed into by a police car and kicked in the head during a brutal arrest in Melbourne. 

The man, who works as a roof plumber, is being treated in an intensive care unit following the disturbing incident at Epping, in the city's north, on Sunday.

Bystanders filmed the arrest and captured the man being kicked and pinned to the ground by a group of up to five officers on a median strip of road.

Footage obtained by 7 News moments before the arrest showed the man waving his arms in the air on the road before being hit by a police car and flying through the air.

The man's father Glen told 3AW his son had been taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries and was later placed into an induced coma.

The man, who has not been named, was being treated in an intensive care unit at a hospital following the incident at Epping, in north Melbourne, on Sunday

He said doctors had performed a CT scan of his head and had yet to deliver the results to the family.  

'The police had no right to do what they did,' he said. 

'This bloke needs to be accountable and lose his job.' 

Glen said his son had been mentally unwell and was going to be admitted to a psychiatric ward on the day of the arrest.

He had already been waiting at the hospital for a day-and-half, but had reportedly been unable to get a bed.  

Glen said his son called his apprentice to pick him up before he ran out the front door of the hospital.

He said his son was considered to be a 'danger to himself' and doctors rang the police.  

Glen claims the matter got out of hand when police arrived on scene and attempted to apprehend his son.

Bystanders filmed a group of police officers surrounding the man.  

An officer can be seen kicking the shirtless man as he lay flat on the ground, rolling him into a face-down position. 

As the man wriggles in an attempt to get up, a second officer kicks his head down.

The group of six officers then pile on to the man's back to pin him down before putting him in handcuffs.

Distressed onlookers watching the skirmish unfold pulled over in their car to film.

'Are you  f*****g kidding me?' the driver can be heard saying.

The motorist then yells at the police to stop kicking the man before his passenger urges him to be quiet.

Victoria Police said the incident unfolded after officers were called to Cooper Street to reports of a male behaving erratically about 4.10pm. 

'Upon arrival the male allegedly became aggressive and damaged a police vehicle whilst attempting to avoid arrest,' a police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia .  

'During the highly dynamic incident a police officer was assaulted and OC spray was deployed before the man was arrested and subsequently taken to hospital for assessment.'

The arrest has been referred to Professional Standards Command.
