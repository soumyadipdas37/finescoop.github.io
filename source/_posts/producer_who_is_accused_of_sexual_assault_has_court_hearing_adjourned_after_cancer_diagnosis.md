 An award-winning Downton Abbey producer accused of sexual assault had his latest court appearance adjourned for a second time today after being diagnosed with cancer.

Film and television writer Chris Croucher, 39, allegedly assaulted the woman at various locations in Westminster last December.

The screenwriter who has worked on movies with Hollywood A-listers Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman and Kirsten Dunst, is charged with sexual assault and common assault and was due to attend Westminster Magistrates’ Court today.

Producer Chris Croucher, 39, has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in Westminster

 Croucher received two Emmy nominations and won the NTA award for best drama twice for his work on series five and six of Downton Abbey

 Croucher’s first hearing was put off earlier this month after a magistrate was told he had been diagnosed with cancer and was receiving treatment.

The hearing was adjourned until 26 October. 

Guildford-born Croucher graduated from Surrey Institute Of Art And Design in 2003 with a BA in Film & TV Production and was a producer on TV shows The Halcyon, The Innocents and White Lines.  

Prosecutor Aaron McCallister said: ‘I understand Croucher was adjourned due to his ill health on the last occasion.

‘I understand there was an application on behalf of the defence to adjourn again.

The film and television writer has also worked on The Other Boleyn Girl with Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman

‘The Crown’s position is we don’t object to an adjournment.

‘The defendant is currently suffering from cancer as I understand.’

Magistrate Richard Duncalf said: ‘[The adjournment] is due to ill-health.’

Croucher worked on the Emmy award-winning show Downton Abbey as well as The Other Boleyn Girl starring Scarlett Johnasson and Natalie Portman.

He was also an associate director on Wimbledon, with Paul Bethany and Kirsten Dunst.
