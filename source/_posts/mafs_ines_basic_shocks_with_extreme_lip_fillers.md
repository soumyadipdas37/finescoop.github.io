Ines Basic was arguably the most controversial participant to ever appear on Married At First Sight.

But even loyal MAFS viewers would be stunned to see what the reality TV villain looks like nowadays.

This week, the 30-year-old showed off her extreme lip fillers in a new interview on her YouTube channel.

The Bosnian beauty's pout was significantly plumper than when she appeared on TV almost two years ago.

Ines has been incredibly open about tweaking her appearance through cosmetic surgery.

Last year, she opened up about some of her procedures in an interview with Now to Love.

'I get Botox done on my forehead, crow's feet and for my frown. I also get lip fillers and advanced skin treatments, like lasering,' she explained.

Ines was branded a 'villain' during the 2019 season of Married At First Sight for her affair with Sam Ball, who was partnered with fan favourite Elizabeth Sobinoff.

Despite keeping a fairly low profile since taking part in Nine's social experiment, Ines has forged a successful career as an Instagram influencer.

Last month, a $100 pair of pants by Melbourne fashion label Ivory & Chain sold out within two hours after the stunner shared an image of herself wearing them.

Back in May, Ines announced that she had launched a new YouTube channel to share lifestyle content with her fans.
