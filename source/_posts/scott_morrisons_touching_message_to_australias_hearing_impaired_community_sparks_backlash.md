Scott Morrison's touching social media post for the country's deaf and hearing community has been hijacked by angry Australians. 

The prime minister posted a video on Instagram on Wednesday where he shared how he had been learning Auslan – Australia's sign language.

In the post he thanks Auslan interpreters for their work during the COVID-19 crisis. 

Many Australians praised the prime minister for his efforts in learning the language.

'Actually I'm so impressed,' one person wrote.

'You're awesome, have an amazing Day,' another wrote.

'Well done PM . We have all benefited by your and the National Cabinet's leadership during this COVID-19 pandemic. And are indebted to those wonderful people the sign language interpreters who were a part of each update,' wrote another.

But the comments section then quickly took a turn with several Victorians urging the Prime Minister to 'step up' and boot premier Dan Andrews from office. 

'Scotty, you're a smart man. Get rid of Dan. He ruined Victoria. Scotty take leadership. Do the right thing for Victoria,' one wrote.

'God bless you ScoMo, please try do something about Dan Andrews,' another person wrote.

Others criticised Mr Morrison's leadership style and policy decisions

'I like you and all but please can you do something about Victoria, it's not bad, it's worse and there is no end in sight with the current government. No confidence,' wrote another.

'Your voice is needed in Victoria!!! Aren't you the opposition?' another wrote.

Others criticised Mr Morrison's leadership style and policy decisions. 

'Yep, Auslan is good and has a clear purpose, unlike your technology roadmap. No real targets and guidelines. Australia is becoming the laughing stock of the world,' one man wrote. 

One woman called on Mr Morrison to commit to zero carbon emissions. 'Think about renewables,' she wrote.
