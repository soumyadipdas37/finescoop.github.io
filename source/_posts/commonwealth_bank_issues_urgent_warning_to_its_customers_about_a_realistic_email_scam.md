Commonwealth Bank has issued an urgent warning to customers about a scam email that has been circulating online that asks for account details. 

The bank took to social media on Wednesday to share an example of the hoax email, which claims the customer's account has been disabled.

'Due to recent activity on your account, we have placed a temporary suspension until you verify your account,' the email read.

People are then asked to follow a link in order to verify their account. 

'Please don't respond to this email, if you have any questions call the number on the back of your card,' the email continued. 

The word 'until' is spelled incorrectly in the email. 

Incorrect spelling is often a sign that an email is a scam and an attempt to defraud the receiver. 

'We are aware that some of our customers have received this email asking them to verify their account. This is a hoax,' Commonwealth Bank wrote on Facebook.

'If you, or anyone you know has received this email, please delete it.'

Anyone who believes they have been scammed is urged to contact Commonwealth Bank.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Commonwealth Bank for comment.
