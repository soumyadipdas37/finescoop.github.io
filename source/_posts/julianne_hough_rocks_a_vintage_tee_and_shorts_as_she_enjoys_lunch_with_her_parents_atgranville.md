It was recently announced that her brother Derek Hough, 35, would replace longtime judge Len Goodman on this season of Dancing With The Stars. 

And Julianne Hough was spotted enjoying lunch with their parents, Marriann and Bruce, at Granville in Studio City on Saturday afternoon.

The 32-year-old pro dancer showed off her enviably toned legs in a pair of distressed Daisy Duke shorts as she posed for photos outside the restaurant.

She paired her cut-offs with a vintage tee that had an eagle printed on the front of it.

Julianne's brunette hair was parted in the middle and styled into a variety of soft waves. 

She had on a pair of oversized sunglasses and a black cloth mask that she only removed while seated at their dining table. 

Hough had a black pillowed Chanel bag slung over her shoulder and she had a pair of sandals on her feet.

Before heading to lunch, Julianne and her mom Mariann hosted a 45-minute virtual workout class on Instagram.

The mother-daughter duo took to Julianne's Instagram Story after the workout to comment on the intensity and to encourage her following to partake in future virtual classes.

The Dancing with the Stars alum launched her holistic movement experience earlier this year, and has been offering virtual classes amid COVID-19.

She told Us Weekly in May: 'With so much uncertainty in the world today, it’s easy to feel a bit lost and isolated.

'Now more than ever, people are searching for deeper human connections, and at its core the Kinrgy philosophy guides us to our inner knowing, that it all starts from within.'

Late last month, she sparked reconciliation rumors with her estranged husband Brooks Laich, 37, as they enjoyed a friendly lunch.

The couple split up in May 2020 after nearly three years of marriage, but Julianne celebrated her 32nd birthday with him in July.

Meanwhile, Julianne's brother Derek will be prepping to fill Len Goodman's shoes on Dancing With The Stars for season 29 of the competition series. 

Derek was a pro dancer on the show from 2007 to 2016, winning the coveted MirrorBall trophy a record six times. Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tomoli will return to their roles as judges.

In an interview with Access on Friday, Julianne revealed that Derek reached out to her to vent some of the nerves he was feeling regarding the position.

'[Derek] did text me and he was like, "I'm nervous. I don't know what to do,"' she recalled.

'I just told him that [being a judge] is such an easy job and you have 20-seconds [to get your critique out], but at the same time there is so much pressure because you wanna be able to say the right thing that can really help that couple do the best they can for next week.'

Julianne also reminded Derek that he is a 'total pro' and amazing' and that 'everything [he] says, that comes out of [his] mouth is gold, anyways.'

Season 29 of Dancing With The Stars premieres September 14 on ABC with a special two-hour episode to kick off the season.  

Julianne was on Dancing With Stars from 2007 until her departure in 2017. She took a break in 2009, but ended up returning as a pro in 2014.
