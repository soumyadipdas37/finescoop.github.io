Soccer fans have been told they won't be able to buy jerseys to support the National Women's soccer team in women's sizes.

Nike and the Football Federation of Australia released the country's official home and away kit on Thursday for the Socceroos and the Matildas.

But when fans asked where they could purchase the women's sizing for the new gear they were told it didn't exist.

This is despite the new jerseys being modelled on female players including Matildas captain Sam Kerr and Ellie Carpenter.

Instead, they were told they could wait two years for new gear to be released.

'We apologise for any inconvenience caused and can assure supporters that this will be rectified for the next kit release due in 2022,' the Maltildas official Twitter account wrote.

The merchandise gaffe sent social media including meltdown, with high profile sporting women among those questioning the oversight.

Matildas star Elise Kellond-Knight said it was 'a fairly significant problem' along with an embarassed monkey emoji. 

Sydney FC player and Greater Western Sydney AFL women's player Ellie Brush wholeheartedly agreed.

'Yep. Wtf. (What the f***)' she wrote.

Hundreds of angry fans have critcised the decision, with many arguing a two year wait is simply unacceptable.

'You seriously can't make this up. Australia's National Women's Football Team yet you can only get shirts in men's sizes. You're joking right?' one fan said.

'Waiting a full two years is totally unacceptable for a mistake that shouldn't have happened to begin with,' another said.  

The new team uniforms were made with 100 per cent recycled polyester from plastic bottles.

Both designs feature a modern take on the 2004 Socceroos kit, with the 'home' jersey featuring the classic gold jersey, and the away styled in a deep obsidian.  

As part of the campaign launch Matildas Captain Sam Kerr described her excitement at donning the new uniforms.

'It's an honour to play in green and gold and we can't wait to get back on the pitch as a team,' she said. 

'The next few years are so important for Australian women's football, and we intend to do everyone proud in the lead up to a huge 2023.'

The new uniforms were released ahead of the FIFA World Cup in 2022 and the AFC Women's Asia Cup in 2022. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Nike and the Football Federation of Australia for comment.
