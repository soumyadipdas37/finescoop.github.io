A woman has dodged jail after smashing a bottle over a love rival's head in a nightclub toilets after she was accused of giving the victim's boyfriend an STD.

Jody Edwards, 22, was on the dancefloor of the Fiction club in Swansea, South Wales, when the victim confronted her over a fling with her boyfriend.

Swansea Crown Court heard Edwards was accused of giving the victim's boyfriend a sexually transmitted disease.

When the defendant walked away to go to the toilet, the victim followed her inside.

The victim then threw a drink over Edwards and the defendant responded by slapping her, causing the woman to stumble.

Edwards then hit her in the head with the bottle she was holding, leaving the victim 'covered in blood'.

The club's security and the police were called. 

Prosecutor Ian Ibrahim said Edwards then told officers the woman had smacked her first and she 'deserved it' during the fight in August last year. 

The victim suffered a gash between her eyes which needed stitching, a cut to the back of her head, and a broken finger, a judge heard.

Her face was so badly injured she has been permanently scarred.

Judge Walters said the row revolved around the victim accusing Edwards of 'giving her boyfriend a sexually transmitted disease.'

He said Edwards had 'completely lost it' and overreacted in striking out with a bottle.

Edwards was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years and ordered to complete a rehabilitation course.

She must also pay her victim £1,000 compensation.
