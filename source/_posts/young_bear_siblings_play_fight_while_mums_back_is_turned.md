A pair of young bear siblings have been photographed play fighting while their mum's back was turned in Russia.  

Nature photographer Valerio Ferraro, 47, took the snaps in Kurile Lake, Russia, when the little bears began to throw hands in a playful wrestle.

The lake is situated in Kamchatka, a former nuclear submarine outpost, and is abundant in animals due to no one being able to live in the area until the end of the Cold War. 

Valerio travelled by helicopter with a small group, finding the group of bears while sitting on a beach, before the cubs adorably began to play while their mum went salmon fishing.

Valerio, from Varese, Italy, said: 'The bears confront each other in this game so that in the future, as adults, they will win the struggle for survival.

'Often they approached, intrigued by our equipment and the life jackets we used on the boat.

'Adult bears often fought because they are not used to socializing during the rest of the year. They are very scary!

'They are just skirmishes, they hardly get hurt. They can only get hurt during the mating season to gain supremacy over a female.

'The bears' mother exploited our presence - male bears often attack cubs and kill them to make females fertile again.

'In this case, our presence kept the males away and the females could leave the cubs close to us to be able to fish and play safely.

'When mum went fishing, the cubs wasted no time playing.'

The bears swipe at each other during their play fight on the banks of Kurile Lake, Russia. According to the photographer, the bears confront each other in this way when they're young to be prepared for later life 

Adult bears will often fight due to not fighting during certain seasons. The young bears have play fights to prepare themselves for these later tussles, the photographer said
