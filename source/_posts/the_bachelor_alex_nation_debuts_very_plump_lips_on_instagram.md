Alex Nation is no stranger to beauty treatments, but one recent change to her appearance has raised more than a few eyebrows.

The former Bachelor star, 28, debuted a remarkably plump pout in her latest Instagram post on Monday, sparking rumours she's had filler.

Not only are her lips significantly larger than they used to be, her upper lip appears to have doubled in size compared to her last selfie on August 29. 

Something to tell us? The Bachelor's Alex Nation has sparked lip filler speculation after she debuted a remarkably plump pout on Instagram on Monday

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Alex's agent at Chadwick Models for comment.

The single mother has made no secret of her fondness for cosmetic injectables in the past, but hasn't disclosed whether or not she's had lip filler.

In September 2018, she proudly told her Instagram followers she'd had a 'little somethin' somethin' done' to her face.

'Yes people will have an opinion. No I'm not bothered. Why? Because I am feelin' myself! Thanks for making this mumma feel fresh,' she wrote in the caption, tagging a Melbourne anti-ageing clinic.

When fans asked what she'd had done, Alex said she'd received Botox injections to smooth out her forehead wrinkles and crow's feet, as well as under-eye filler and a procedure to 'define the chin and jawline'.

While the model admitted she was apprehensive at first, she insisted that she was delighted with the results.

'All very subtle and small doses. I'm really happy,' she wrote.

They split after several months and Alex later came out as pansexual and revealed she was engagement to a woman - but this relationship didn't last either.
