Arsenal will face London rivals West Ham at the Emirates Stadium this evening as they look to build on their Premier League opening win against Fulham. 

The Gunners will be hoping for another top performance from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who finally signed a new three-year deal with the club after a summer of uncertainty.  

Meanwhile, West Ham will look to bounce back after their opening game defeat to Newcastle, but now face a horror run of fixtures including Liverpool, Manchester City, and Tottenham. 

Sportsmail's MATT PORTER will provide live EPL coverage of Arsenal vs West Ham including score, lineups and build-up.

Host commentator

Arsenal appear to be on the up. They've brought in some new signings and their all-important captain Aubameyang has signed a new deal. A good win today could see them back to the top of the table. 

Meanwhile West Ham are struggling. They had a tough loss to Newcastle last week, then captain Mark Noble hit out at the board amid fan protests. Now they've got to play Arsenal, Manchester City, Leicester, Tottenham, and Liverpool over their next six league games.
