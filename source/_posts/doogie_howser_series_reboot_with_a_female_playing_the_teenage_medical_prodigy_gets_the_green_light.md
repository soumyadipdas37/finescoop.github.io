Disney + has officially picked up a female-led reboot of the beloved series Doogie Howser, M.D.   

The new and updated version, titled Doogie Kameāloha M.D., will focus on Lahela 'Doogie' Howser, a mixed race 16-year who works as a doctor in Hawaii, according to Variety. 



The original show, which starred Neil Patrick Harris in the title role as a teenage physician who balanced the challenges of practicing medicine with the everyday problems of teenage life, aired from 1989 to 1993.

Reimagined: The popular series Doogie Howser M.D. is getting the reboot from Disney+ with a female playing the role of the teenage medical prodigy; Neil Patrick Harris starred in the original series that aired from 1989-1993

Despite being broadcast for four seasons the first time around, the show made an impact on the pop culture lexicon and went on to become even more popular after it was canceled.

The reboot will be written and executive produced by Kourtney Kang, who's best known for launching Fresh Off The Boat and her work on all nine seasons of How I Met Your Mother, which also starred Neil Patrick Harris. 



Jake Kasdan and Melvin Mar will also executive produce along with Dayna and Jesse Bochco serving as producers.    

New take; The updated series, titled Doogie Kameāloha M.D., will focus on Lahela 'Doogie' Howser, a mixed race 16-year who works as a doctor in Hawaii, according to Variety

The new 10-episode comedy will also see the lead character juggle her budding medical career and life as a teenager. 

Guiding Lahela, while simultaneously complicating things, is her family, including her spit-fire Irish mother who's also her supervisor at the hospital and her Hawaiian 'Local Boy' father who's struggles to accept that his daughter is no longer his little girl.    

'Doogie Howser MD is beloved by everyone at our studio, so we knew that if we were going to reinvent it for a new generation, we had to have both the blessing and participation of the Bochcos and a creator with a fresh, new take that made us lean in,' said Carolyn Cassidy, president of 20th Television. 

Coming: The reboot will go into production later this year and debut on Disney + in 2021 

'Kourtney’s vision for the character is so inspired, we’ve been dying to collaborate with Melvin and Jake again, and Disney+ is exactly the right home for this idea. We couldn't be more excited.'

Ricky Strauss, Disney + president, Content and Marketing, gave more insight into the upcoming series by revealing the show will have a modern take on the young medical prodigy.

'We can't wait to introduce the world to the new Doogie,' Strauss added.

The reboot will go into production later this year for a debut on the streaming service in 2021.
