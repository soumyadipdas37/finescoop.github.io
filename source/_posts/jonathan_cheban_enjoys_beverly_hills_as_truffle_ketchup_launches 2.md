Last week, his best friend Kim Kardashian gushed about his brand new Food God Truffle Ketchup, which is available now.

And on Saturday, Jonathan Cheban, known as Foodgod, was seen leaving lunch with a small beverage in hand.

The 46-year-old star cut a casual figure after enjoying lunch with a pal at celeb hot spot Ill Pastaio in Beverly Hills.

The star donned light green trousers with a black and white T-shirt that said Obsession across the torso. 

Jonathan donned sneakers with aviator sunglasses, while opting to forgot a watch, just weeks after he was robbed.

His watch, a $250,000 model was stolen at gunpoint earlier this month in the quiet, upscale neighborhood of Englewood Cliffs in New Jersey while the star was with a friend and mother, Galina.

 'It was frightening, I want the guys caught,' Cheban told DailyMail.com exclusively.

'The mugger had a gun pointed at my mother's head. There were two gunmen. It happened at 8:30 pm just as the sun was going down.'

Cheban also told DailyMail.com this week that though he talked to police who had sketches of the criminals made up, the attackers have not been caught yet. 

Last week Jonathan said he does not want to be in New York City these days, even though the incident happened in New Jersey.

'I can't be there. It's very traumatic to be there,' the 46-year-old told Page Six on Monday. 'I want to sell my apartment in New York for sure because I can't imagine living there again.'

While he was robbed in New Jersey, Cheban slammed Mayor Bill de Blasio for his lack of action over a recent spike in armed robberies, among Manhattan's Upper East Side.

'Daytime, nighttime, afternoon, Midtown, Uptown, Downtown, the mayor has destroyed the city,' he told the outlet. 'It's depressing. It's scary. I was on edge before, but now I'm even more on edge, obviously.'

He added: 'I'm just confused as to how they're allowing this to happen. I just cannot believe [New Yorkers] would vote for this idiot two times.'

His outing on Saturday comes as his best friend Kim  Kardashian promoted his brand new Foodgod truffle ketchup, which is $19.95 for a 9 ounce bottle.
