Counter terrorism officers arrested a man in his 20s after a homemade explosive was allegedly posted to a home in London.

Detectives arrested the man this morning at an address in Cambridge, assisted by an armed response unit as a precautionary measure.

The man has been detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and taken into custody at a south London police station.
