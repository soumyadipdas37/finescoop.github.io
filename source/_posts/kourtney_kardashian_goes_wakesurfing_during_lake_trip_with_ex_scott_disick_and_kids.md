Kourtney Kardashian has been enjoying plenty of quality family time with her kids during quarantine.

And the Poosh founder recently got away with ex Scott Disick and their children for a lake trip.

She showed off her athletic skill Monday, as she went wakesurfing on a gorgeous summer day, while celebrating Labor Day weekend on their family getaway.

The 41-year-old put her toned legs on display, while covering up her swimwear with a black and white life preserver, writing: 'learn new things.'

She was all smiles, as she enjoyed what was left of their vacation, before getting back home to Los Angeles. 

Kourtney has been living the lake life, previously modeling an orange bikini and a blue bucket hat, while posing it up with their new pup Ruby on the boat.

The Talentless founder also enjoyed the family time, sharing a sweet photo of himself steering the boat with son Reign Aston, five, in his lap.

He's reportedly been focusing on his family, amid his split with girlfriend of three years Sofia Richie, 22, back in May.

A source told People last month: 'It's always been difficult for them to balance their relationship with Scott's family life. His kids will always come first.'

The insider added: 'Scott's focus is his health and the kids. Sofia wants to hang out with friends and enjoy the summer. Since they are no longer on the same page, they decided to just be apart. At least for now.'

The split came after Scott briefly checked into rehab in Colorado, before leaving a week later over privacy concerns. 

Kourtney addresses the scandal in an upcoming episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, discussing leaked photos and conversations with his therapist.

She said in a clip from the upcoming season 19: 'I feel like whoever did leak this information should be really ashamed of themselves. Everyone deserves to deal with their past traumas in privacy. He was completely violated.'

Kourtney and Scott were in an on-again, off-again relationship from 2006 to 2016, and they share sons Mason Dash, 10, Reign Aston, five, and daughter Penelope Scotland, eight.
