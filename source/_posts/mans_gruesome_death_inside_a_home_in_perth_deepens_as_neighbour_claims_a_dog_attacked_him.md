A man in his 50s has been found dead inside a home - with a neighbour claiming a dog is at the centre of the attack. 

Emergency services were called to a home on Halvorson Street, Morley, 10km northeast of Perth's CBD, at 8.10pm on Monday. 

A 36-year-old man is helping police with their investigation.

A dog is understood to be at the centre of the mysterious death, the ABC reported. 

Mike Scott said his neighbour began to bang on his door at 7.30pm - moments before emergency services arrived.

'[He was] just sort of saying  a dog had attacked somebody in his house and that it was pretty gruesome,' Mr Scott said.

'And as that was happening, police and ambos turned up … he was pretty panicky.

'Hopefully it was just a bad accident and nothing worse than that.'

An council animal ranger was also called to the scene, in addition to homicide detectives.  

Titan Wiwanno, who lives nearby, confirmed a big dog lives at the home, and it often barked and tried to climb the fence.

He told the West Australian he didn't know the man but often saw him come in and out of his home.  

Police, along with forensics team, are expected to be at the property for most of the day

'I came back from the gym (last night) and all I saw were all police cars and ambulances,' he said.

'It's sad... he seems like a pretty nice guy.

'I always see him and wave.' 

Police, along with forensics team, are expected to be at the property for most of the day.
