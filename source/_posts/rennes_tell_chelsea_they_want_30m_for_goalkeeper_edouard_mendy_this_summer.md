Rennes have informed Chelsea that they want over £30million if they are to sell goalkeeper Edouard Mendy in this transfer window.

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard is eager to bring the Senegal shot-stopper to Stamford Bridge, as reported by The Telegraph.

Lampard is unconvinced by Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has been unable to justify the £72million fee that Chelsea paid for him two years ago.

Mendy has kept 13 clean sheets in 34 appearances for Rennes since he joined the club last year.

There is a possibility that Kepa could stay at Chelsea but he would fall down the pecking order if Mendy arrives. 

Willy Caballero is still at the club, but Lampard is eager to bring in a long-term solution to Chelsea's goalkeeping issue, with Mendy his preferred choice.

Lampard has overseen a significant recruitment drive as Chelsea seek to improve their squad

Chelsea have undertaken a significant recruitment drive as they attempt to push on further.

Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell and Thiago Silva have all joined as Lampard has strengthened his side in various positions.

Bayer Leverkusen star Kai Havertz could be the next arrival at the club and there may well be further acquisitions beyond that.
