A proud mum says her disabled son was thrilled to receive a doll that had disabilities just like him.  

Emma Evert, from Brisbane, said her vision-impaired son Harlen was delighted after getting a Kmart diversity doll with thick glasses and a cane.

Harlen has septo-optic dysplasia, which means he is legally blind and is developmentally delayed. He also uses a cane to help him walk.

Emma Evert from Brisbane said her vision-impaired son Harlen was thrilled when he was gifted a toy that had a 'disability' just like him

Kmart Australia has released a range of dolls with disabilities, including ones that are blind, deaf, on crutches, in a wheelchair or have a bionic leg

'She has fluffy hair and a cane and glasses like me!' an excited Harlen told A Current Affair. 

'I was a little bit emotional, it's something different that I haven't seen before,' Ms Evert said.

'He did a big squeal, he was super excited and he said 'it's got a cane like me mum, how does it even have a cane like me'. I think it's great for all visually impaired or kids with disabilities to see themselves represented on a shelf.' 

Kmart released the progressive new range of Fashion Dolls which promote diversity for children and people of all ages with disabilities.

The range includes dolls that are blind, deaf, have bionic legs or use a wheelchair. 

Ms Evert commended the retail giant for introducing the new toys to the market.

'Kmart absolutely killing it with the new range of inclusive dolls,' she wrote on Facebook. 

'It is so important that kids with disabilities are represented in TV, books and toys. It's equally important their typical developing peers have exposure to these things.

'It empowers kid's to celebrate ability!'

John Gualtieri, Kmart Retail Director Australia & New Zealand, said they wanted their young customers to have something they could relate to

John Gualtieri, Kmart Retail Director Australia & New Zealand, echoed Ms Evert's sentiments saying they wanted all their customers to relate to their products. 

'We want all of our customers, especially our littlest ones, to be able to find products that they can truly relate to; and we're committed to championing inclusion and diversity to make sure this happens,' he told 7News. 

'That's why we're so excited to introduce our newest assortment of Fashion Dolls, which reflect people living with disabilities.

'We hope these dolls help children celebrate all of the wonderful things that make us different and unique; and that they can help remove some of the stigma around disability.' 

Each doll is $6 and comes in its own outfit, which can be mixed and matched between them.
