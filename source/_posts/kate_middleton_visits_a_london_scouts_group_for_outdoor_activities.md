The Duchess of Cambridge was in her element as she got stuck in with outdoor activities during a visit to a London Scouts Group today.

The Duchess, who has often spoken of her love of the great outdoors, joined the children in toasting marshmallows on a campfire and writing letters to send to care home residents. 

She was also named co-president of the Scouts. Kate is sharing the position - her first presidency of an organisation - with the Queen's cousin, the Duke of Kent, who has been president of the youth movement since 1975.

She beamed as she chatted to the children and learned more about what they do with Scouts.

This year, Scout groups across the UK have contributed over 10,000 acts of kindness by sending cards and greetings to care home residents.

Kate also spent time thanking the organisation’s volunteers for their hard work in supporting over half a million young people and their families throughout lockdown. 

She heard how the Scouts have adapted during the pandemic to continue providing Scouting sessions and online activities through their #TheGreatIndoors campaign, before meeting with parents and carers of young people who have been supported by the organisation.

Since forming, The Scout Association has provided support and activities to young people within the local community. 

The organisation helps to support almost half a million people from all backgrounds aged 6-25 gain the life skills they need for to prepare for their futures, making it the largest co-educational youth movement in the country. Through its work, the Scouts also aims to help build stronger communities across the UK. 

Her Majesty The Queen is Patron of The Scout Association whilst The Duke of Kent is the organisation’s President. 

The Duchess of Cambridge has previously volunteered with the Scouts during her time in Anglesey. 

She has visited other Scouts groups in recent years, including a special Cub Scout Pack meeting in Kings Lynn in 2016 to celebrate 100 years of Cubs, and a visit with the Menai Bridge Scouts in Wales in 2019 with The Duke of Cambridge. 

Her Royal Highness also visited the Scouts Headquarters at Gilwell Park last year to learn more about the Scouts’ Early Years pilot programme, and to celebrate the site’s 100th anniversary year.
