It comes after it was reported in June that Melissa signed a generous new deal to host the next two seasons of Junior MasterChef. 

A source told New Idea: 'Melissa has a new big MasterChef deal. It's confirmed. She will head up the judging panel of Junior MasterChef, and it's a million-dollar deal for the next two series.'
