The Masked Singer has hit Australian TV screens but if you're still unsure about the concept then why not pay more attention to Dannii Minogue's wardrobe like we are at Fashion Finder HQ.

The judge got dressed up for another show in this gorgeous bespoke dress by Australian couture label couture+love+madness. Stylist Rachel Dennis completed the look with Steve Madden heels and jewellery by Shannakian.

We're loving the disco-inspired sparkle, the ruched silhouette that flatters the figure and statement off-shoulder bodice, it's perfect for such a glitzy event.

The singer's look even inspired a few fans to consider adopting some rosy locks of their own. 

One person Tweeted: 'Oh my god Minogue. You look stunning!!!! Ahh I want my pink hair back.' 

Several fans compared her to the show's masked Kitten character, who has pink fur.

Someone wrote: 'Cute Kitty!!! Pink is my fave hair colour on you,' while others suggested she wore the pink look to match the Kitten. 

Sadly for fans of the disco-inspired look, Dannii admitted in a Twitter post that the hair is a wig. 

Quoting Dolly Parton, she wrote: 'People always ask me how long it takes to do my hair. I don't know, I'm never there.'
