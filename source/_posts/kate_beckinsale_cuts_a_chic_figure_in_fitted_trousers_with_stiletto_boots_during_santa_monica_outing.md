Kate Beckinsale has been enjoying some romantic time with boyfriend Goody Grace during quarantine.

But the British actress has been preparing to return to work, as Hollywood bounces back from the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, the movie star stepped out in black stilettos with chic trousers, as she took her Pomeranian Myf to a meeting at Shutters on the Beach hotel in Santa Monica.

The 47-year-old paired the boots with matching skintight pants and a white tank top, layered under a long lightweight short-sleeve beige cardigan.

She wore her hair up with a pair of chunky black cat-eye sunglasses and a blue face mask, carrying a black leather Fendi purse over her shoulder.

Beckinsale has been getting serious with Grace, 23, with whom she was first romantically linked back in April, when they were spotted holding hands while out for a walk.   

A source told HollywoodLife: 'They actually have a lot in common. Kate is a free spirit and she appreciates that Goody is talented. He’s really mature, and they can have deep conversations but also can be really playful and goofy at the same time.

'L' bomb: They took a big step back in July, when they publicly dropped the 'L' bomb to each other on her 47th birthday

'She just enjoys being with him and she loves him for who he is. He treats her with complete respect and what else could a woman ask for in a partner.'

They took a big step back in July, when they publicly dropped the 'L' bomb to each other on her 47th birthday.

'HAPPY BIRTHDAY I LOVE YOU,' he commented on her Instagram post, to which she responded: '@goodygrace I love you [kiss face emoji].'   

It came after she clapped back at a troll who criticized their age gap in an Instagram comment earlier in the month.

'Why do you keep dating guys that could be your children?' he asked, to which she quipped: 'Every relationship I have had has been solely to annoy you.'

She and Grace reportedly also have the stamp of approval from her daughter Lily Mo, 21, whom she shares with ex Michael Sheen, 51. 

A source told Us Weekly last month: 'Kate’s daughter, Lily, doesn’t care about the age difference between her mom and Goody and is happy that her mom is happy. 

'Kate and Lily still have a super close and healthy mother-daughter relationship, and Lily does not view Kate as competition or ever feel like Kate would "steal" a guy she might be interested in. Kate would never do that to her daughter, and Kate and Lily also have different taste in guys.'

Beckinsale told Women's Health UK for the June cover: 'It can feel like a little bit of a political act to be a woman over 32 who’s having any fun at all.'
