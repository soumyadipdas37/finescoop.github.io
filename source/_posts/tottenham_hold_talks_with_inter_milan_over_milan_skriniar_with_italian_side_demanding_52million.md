Tottenham have held talks over a deal for Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar, 25, but remain some way apart on valuation with the Italians asking for £52m.

Technical director Steve Hitchen was in Milan in Wednesday for talks with Skriniar’s representatives.

Tottenham reportedly attempted to include Tanguy Ndombele as part of a deal but Inter Milan are not interested in the midfielder.

Skriniar fell out of favour at Inter towards the end of last season and the 25-year-old may be tempted by the prospect of regular playing time at Tottenham.

Since joining Inter in 2016, Skriniar has 128 appearances for the club. 

Tottenham are eager to bring in a centre-back with Jose Mourinho determined for his side to be more resilient at the back.

The north London club have been heavily active during this transfer window, bringing Gareth Bale back on loan while also signing Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Joe Hart, Matt Doherty and Sergio Reguilon.

Tottenham can call upon the likes of Toby Alderweireld, Davinson Sanchez and Eric Dier as centre-back options, while they also have youngster Japhet Tanganga at their disposal.
