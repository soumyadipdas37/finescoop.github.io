They recently made a comeback to screens with the latest edition of The Mummy Diaries.

And Billie and Sam Faiers appeared to celebrate their return to TV by enjoying a night out at The Arts Club in the English capital on Saturday.

Proving to be in good company, the reality stars, aged 30 and 29 respectively, were joined by close pal Claudia Allen, who recently welcomed a baby with Tony Knightley - the brother of Sam's partner Paul Knightley.

Former TOWIE star Billie - who shares Nelly, six, and Arthur, three, with husband Paul Shepherd - looked sensational in a black jumpsuit, which accentuated her slender figure.

Standing out, the mum-of-two boosted her frame in platform heels and carried her essentials in a gold, crocodile skin clutch.

The former glamour model styled her tresses into a high ponytail, while her complexion was enhanced with dewy make-up.  

Sam, meanwhile, exuded sophistication in brown co-ords, complete with a baggy satin shirt and matching trousers.

Earlier in the month, the media personality gushed about taking the next step in her relationship with the father of her two children, insisting she's 'looking forward' to having son Paul Jr., four, and daughter Rosie, two, take part in the ceremony.

Confessing she's made plans about her wedding 'in my head' ahead of her boyfriend's proposal, Sam told MailOnline: 'I'm really excited for that time when it comes and I feel like I've got that to look forward to. 

'So much has happened since Paul and I got together. In terms of my wedding, I sort of do know what I would like. 

'I would want to get married abroad in Europe and I'd want quite a small intimate wedding. I haven't got a planner or anything but you do think about what you'd like!'

The TV star said: 'In episode one of Mummy Diaries, I think Paul says that lockdown can be a make or break for a lot of people and I completely understand where he's coming from. 

'Sometimes you don't spend that quality time as a family like before, so I've just loved having dinner as a family and settling into the house. For us, all I kept thinking was this is going to be over in a minute and I just wanted to keep things positive. 

'Within six months of being together we started our first business, so working and living together is just normal.'
