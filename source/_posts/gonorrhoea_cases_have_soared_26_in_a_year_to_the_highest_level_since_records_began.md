More people are catching gonorrhea in England and Wales than ever before, official figures revealed today.

There were 70,936 cases of the sexually transmitted infection last year, the highest number since records began in 1918. 

It marks a 26 per cent increase from 2018 and 71 per cent jump from levels seen in 2015, according to Public Health England.

Health bosses said the spike is largely being driven by gay and bisexual men, but diagnoses have risen among women and straight males.

Chlamydia and syphilis are also the most prevalent they have been in at least a decade.

In response to the figures, PHE has urged people to start using condoms properly and for hospitals, clinics and GP surgeries to make them more available.

There were 5,311 diagnoses of Mycoplasma genitalium reported in 2019, a 196 per cent increase since 2018. But this increase reflects a rise in the availability of testing.
