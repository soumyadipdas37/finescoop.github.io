Daphne Oz has opened up about how she tackles stress during the coronavirus pandemic, explaining that she makes a conscious effort to hold on to life's 'little joys,' whether it be reading to her four children or enjoying a glass of wine

Stress and the negative effect it has on the skin has been on the 34-year-old television host's mind since she became the co-owner of the new clean beauty brand LOUM, which was developed with psychodermatologist Dr. Francisco Tausk.   

'I look for moments of calm amid the crazy. If I hold out for expanses of time to de-stress, it’s never going to happen,' the mother of four told DailyMail.com. 'I used to like to relax and linger in the kitchen, that was my major stress reliever. Now, it's a bit more of an exercise in expedience, but I still have fun!'

Happy: The 34-year-old mother of four has opened up about how she tackles stress and keeps it from negatively affecting the appearance of her skin, saying she focuses on life's 'little joys'

For the busy mother of four, the trick to self-care is sneaking it into her day whenever and wherever she can.   

'I’ve been known to do a face mask while I make the kids breakfast or get my coffee, it’s all about the multitask moment,' she explained. 

'Whether it's a skincare routine, a quick moment of connection with my husband, taking 20 minutes to cook a quick meal for my family, or bath time and reading with the kids, it's really important to hold on to the little joys.'

The cookbook author also noted that 'a glass of wine or tequila is always welcome!'  

Daphne certainly knows a thing or two about multitasking. She and her husband John Jovanovic spent a large portion of the year quarantined at home with their four children — Philomena Bijou, Jovan Jr., Domenica Celine, and Giovanna Ines — who range in age from six to one.

'I think the pandemic has forced all of us to reexamine our relationship with stress and our coping mechanisms,' she said. 'A lot of us may have gotten by in the past by ignoring what our bodies are telling us, but that isn’t sustainable.' 

She also believes that the global crisis has led people to be more open about the stress that they are experiencing.   

'We’re letting ourselves have good days and bad days more than we would have wanted to admit before, too, and I think that’s healthy and human,' she said. 'And we’re able to see that it’s affecting everyone. Finding your community and support is always a balm.'

Of course, stress is inevitable, but teaming up with LOUM has made her conscious of the effect it has on her physical appearance.  

'While I think we all recognize the way stress makes us feel, I was surprised when I began learning about the physical effects of stress on the skin,' she said. 'Research shows stress causes everything from oiliness and breakouts, to dryness and dullness, to premature aging.' 

Making it work: Daphne said she looks for 'moments of calm amid the crazy.' She is always multitasking and will sometimes do a face mask while making her family breakfast

Daphne became aware that her skin would start to look dull and tired after long days, especially when she was rushing to meet deadlines while also taking care of her family. 

'I definitely noticed more sagging and occasional breakouts where I would touch or rub my face often,' she said. 'I think it’s also that as stress builds, the first things to go are the little ways we take care of ourselves.' 

The LOUM website boasts that its products 'invoke the science of calm' to undo the effects of stress on both the skin and the psyche, with Daphne noting that the entire line 'multitasks' just like moms do.  

'I have always been a total product junkie, and it has been a dream of mine to help create a line that I really feel lives up to my standards for ultra-clean products that deliver visible results,' she said. 

'I don’t want to smell weird. I don’t want to feel like I’m rubbing granola on my face. And I don’t want to sacrifice looking my best to avoid harsh chemicals and disruptive toxins. That’s what LOUM has to live up to!' 

Daphne said she has always been aware of how food affects the skin, explaining that she makes a point to limit refined sugar, drink tons of water, eat fermented foods for their live probiotics, and prioritize leafy greens and colorful produce.   

Look of love: The television host also likes to make time to have a 'quick moment of connection' with her husband. They celebrated their 10-year anniversary last month 

Paying attention: 'I think the pandemic has forced all of us to reexamine our relationship with stress and our coping mechanisms,' she said

But she credits the LOUM product line with helping her achieve and maintain an 'even, glowy complexion.' 

The line includes cleansers, moisturizes, and oils that range in price from $30 to $90, but Daphne's 'hero product' is the Pure Serenity Golden C Serum. 

The treatment features LOUM's patent-pending TriSerene Complex to calm and rebalance skin, Vitamin C stabilized with submicrometric gold to help maximize its potency, and a TriPeptide Complex to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. 

'I’ve gotten my sisters and my friends hooked on this first because it’s so powerful and easy to work into any skincare routine,' she explained. 'The best part for me is that it feels luxurious but only taking a few seconds to apply.'

Daphne said she uses it in the morning before applying moisturizer and then again at night with LOUM's Awaken Glow Elixir Oil, a combination that she said gives her a 'morning glow.' 

'Coming onboard with the LOUM team offered a totally new insight into the ways we wear our mental state on our skin,' she said. 

'It was actually really affirming to see that treating the whole human is always necessary — it’s our internal physical state AND our internal emotional state that determines what shows up on the outside and how we are able to take on our day.'

LOUM enlisted neuropsychologist Dr. Sanam Hafeez to study the impact of stress on a woman's skin. As part of her work with the skincare brand, the medical expert published a ground-breaking white paper detailing the damage that stress has on the complexion. 

'What we do know about stress is that it is a silent but deadly disease,' Dr. Hafeez explains in the paper. 

'When present chronically it contributes to heart disease, strokes, autoimmune, and a slew of other conditions. But what isn’t commonly discussed is the significant affect stress has on our body’s largest organ, our skin.'

According to the neuropsychologist, stress can have just as serious an impact on the skin - if not more severe - as other factors like diet, exercise, pollutants, and genetics, with Dr. Hafeez explaining that it can trigger all kinds of serious conditions, including psoriasis, eczema, acne, and rosacea.  

However, stress can also result in slightly less obvious complexion issues, causing anything from dryness and redness to oiliness and signs of aging, like fine lines and wrinkles. These conditions tend to develop over time and might not be quite so immediately obvious, making them more difficult to attribute to stress.
