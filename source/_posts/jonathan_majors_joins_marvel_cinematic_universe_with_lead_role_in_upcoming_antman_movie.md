He gained a massive fanbase with a starring role in HBO's hit series, Lovecraft Country.

While the studio has yet to confirm, the site reported that Majors will likely 'be one of the main villains in the next installment in the franchise.'  

Kang was originally born in the 30th century of Earth-6311 as Nathaniel Richards and is known in the MCU for his time-traveling capabilities, which makes the character an easy fit for the Ant-Man genre.

The Ant-Man franchise garnered more than $500million after its first debut in July 2015, with stars Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly.

A second installment, Ant-Man and The Wasp, was released in 2018 and grossed more than $600million worldwide.

Director Peyton Reed confirmed on SiriusXM’s The Jess Cagle Show in August that production was 'working away' on the upcoming film despite the global pandemic. 

'There’s some really really really exciting things in store, none of which of course I could speak to you about right now, as is the Marvel way,' he said.

'I think the third movie is going to be a much bigger, more sprawling movie than the first two. It’s going to have a very different visual template.'

After starring in Spike Lee's war drama Da 5 Bloods, Majors took on the role of Atticus Freeman in the HBO breakout show produced by Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams.

The series was created by Misha Greene and follows Atticus as he travels across the US in the '50s.
