Halsey mixed country with boho chic as she stepped out in Los Angeles on Friday.

The singer, 25, was spotted arriving to a photo shoot wearing a cosmic pair of cowboy boots and a colorful floral dress.

Halsey strutted her way outside of the car, armed with an iced coffee.

Yee-haw! Halsey mixed country with boho chic as she stepped out in Los Angeles on Friday

While her face was hidden behind a disposable face mask, there was no hiding the confidence in Halsey's eyes.

The superstar appeared fierce as she strolled towards the shoot.

The outing comes just days after Halsey announced she will be making her acting debut alongside friend and Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney in a new series entitled The Players Table.

The singer uploaded a sumptuous and fashion-heavy spread of images by Southern California-based photographer Sam Dameshek on Wednesday, posing with Sydney, 22, to share the news.

The actress, most known for her role as delicate and sensual teen Cassie Howard in the hit HBO series Euphoria, also held a video camera in one frame, which Halsey posed in front of with her lips pursed in a kiss.

In her caption, the Edison, New Jersey-born diva identified several key players involved in their new project, including writer-director Annabelle Attanasio and Big Little Lies director Jean-Marc Vallée, who's set to co-produce The Players Table.

It was announced some weeks ago that Sweeney was involved in the project both as star and producer, through her nascent production company Fifty-Fifty Films.

The new series is based on Jessica Goodman’s bestselling debut novel They Wish They Were Us, following a secret society of students at an exclusive Long Island prep school embroiled in the death of a friend three years prior.
