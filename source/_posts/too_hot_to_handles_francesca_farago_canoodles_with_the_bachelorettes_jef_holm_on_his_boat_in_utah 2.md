Too Hot to Handle winner Francesca 'Frankie' Farago canoodled with The Bachelorette #8 winner Jeffrey 'Jef' Holm on his parents' boat while on vacation with a group at Lake Powell on Monday.

The 36-year-old Utah native cuddled up and kissed the shoulder of the Canadian 26-year-old alongside her precious Pomeranian, Romeo 'Romii' Jonathan Webb.

Jef made sure to bond with Frankie's little Romii as well as another precious pup Riggy while soaking up the sunshine.

Farago has been 'pretty inseparable' from Holm for the last month after meeting through their mutual friend Casey Boonstra in Los Angeles where they both live, according to TMZ.

And it's not just a vacation either as the swimwear designer has staged Farago the Label photo shoots with her gal pals Casey, Kelly Lauren, Violet Benson, Cassidy Napolitano, and Sheila.

Frankie got especially close to Boonstra during a twinsy shot in matching leopard-print string bikinis.

The RiSE Festival managing partner seems to be Farago's first promising relationship since her reported flings with YouTuber Tana Mongeau and Jersey Shore's Vinny Guadagnino.
