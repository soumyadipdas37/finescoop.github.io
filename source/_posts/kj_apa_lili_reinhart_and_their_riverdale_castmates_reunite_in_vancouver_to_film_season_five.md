The Riverdale ensemble cast - including KJ Apa and Lili Reinhart - just reunited in Vancouver where they must complete a 14-day quarantine before filming the fifth season, which shoots September 14-May 1.

The 23-year-old Kiwi - who heads up The CW teen soap as Archie Andrews - peeled off his mandatory face mask in order to enjoy a cigarette and Starbucks coffee to-go on Sunday.

Meanwhile, the Ohio-born 23-year-old - who co-stars as Betty Cooper - peeled off her mandatory face mask in order to talk on the phone while walking her rescue dog Milo.

'I'm incredibly grateful to have a job,' Lili tweeted last Thursday.

'I'm sad that I can't see my family for months on end due to travel restrictions.'

Also spotted walking precious pooches on a coffee run were Camila Mendes and Madeline Petsch, who play Veronica Lodge and Cheryl Blossom in the Archie Comics-inspired show.

As of Sunday, there have reportedly been 132K confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada (6,162 of which are in British Columbia) leading to 9,145 deaths.

Madeline Instastoried a video of herself and co-star Casey Cott where she informed Camila that she was never getting her pink bucket hat back because it 'covers my pimple too well.'

Also happy to see Casey - who plays openly gay Kevin Keller - was Lili, who Instastoried that she 'missed him' after production shut down on March 12 due to the fast-spreading virus.

Later that night, KJ posted a funny video of Reinhart's ex-boyfriend Cole Sprouse - who plays Forsythe 'Jughead' Jones III - improvising some dance moves beside a squeaking elevator on the 40th floor.

Even the 28-year-old former child star's onscreen father Skeet Ulrich was amused by him grooving to the malfunctioning doors opening and shutting, and he commented: 'Or beat the drop?'
