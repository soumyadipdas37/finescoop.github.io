Strictly Come Dancing have released their first trailer for the new series, which is set to begin next month.

The preview shared to the show's Instagram Stories on Friday vows that fans will no longer be suffering with the weekday blues as they add some much-needed sparkle to Saturday nights.

Strictly announced their full celebrity lineup last week after months of concerns around whether the new series would go ahead due to the COVID-19 crisis.

The colourful preview begins by asking if 'Weekdays are missing sparkle' before launching into a montage documenting the typical working week.

Among other things this can include work deadlines, work lunches and just work as a whole.

But then as the trailer reaches Saturday, it bursts into a sea of glitter and confetti signalling that Strictly has arrived.

They joined Jason Bell, Ranvir Singh, Clara Amfo, Caroline Quentin, Jamie Laing, Bill Bailey, JJ Chalmers, Max George, Maisie Smith and Nicola Adams on the line-up. 

The reports come after it was claimed the show has been left in crisis as a crew member tested positive for coronavirus. 

As a result 'everyone was told to leave,' according to a source, who also claimed that the set was given a powerful deep clean as show bosses await the results of a third medical test on the lighting expert. 

Cut short: It's thought this year's Strictly will have a shortened run due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is expected to conclude on 19th December

Worries! The reports come after it was claimed the show has been left in crisis as a crew member tested positive for coronavirus

According to The Sun, the lighting expert spent a week working on the dance contest's set.

Following his positive test result, at least five staff who were in close contact with him were sent home and told to self-isolate and await tests of their own, according to the report. 

Additionally, a deep clean of the set using powerful electrostatic sprayers, was apparently ordered. 

The report also claims that a third test on the worker is anxiously being waited for, after a second medical check on his Covid-19 status came back as 'inconclusive.'  

Drama: According to a source all crew members were 'told to leave,' and it was claimed that the set was given a deep clean as show bosses await the results of a third medical test 

The publication's source also claimed that panic spread quickly among the professional dancers who were due to start filming in the studios tomorrow. 

The source also insisted that filming in the studio needs to begin this week if the show is going to be able to film the group dances ahead of the series' scheduled start date, admitting that it's already 'a race against time.'.  

A source told MailOnline: 'the crew member is no longer on the production and has had a negative NHS test result.

'Procedures were followed and stringent protocols have been put in place just in case, but recording isn't due to happen until later this week so there is minimal impact.'
