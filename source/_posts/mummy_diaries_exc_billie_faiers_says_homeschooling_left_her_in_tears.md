Billie Faiers and Jacqueline Jossa have revealed homeschooling in lockdown 'reduced them to tears' while also causing anxiety and stress. 

In Thursday night's episode of The Mummy Diaries, the duo are seen chatting during their work trip to Ibiza last month, when they were promoting In The Style. 

The former TOWIE star, 30, who is mum to Nelly, six, and Arthur, two, delightedly pronounced her and Jacqueline, who is mother to Ella, five, and Mia, two, 'Mums On Tour', before talk turned to their households during the COVID-19 crisis. 

Stressful: Billie Faiers and Jacqueline Jossa have revealed homeschooling in lockdown 'reduced them to tears' while also causing anxiety and stress

Billie and Jacqueline jetted to Ibiza for their In The Style promotions and thanks to The Mummy Diaries camera crew, the trip was documented.  

Speaking in a confessional, Billie delightedly said to the camera: 'Really nice to have Jacqueline here with me. We're both mums in really similar situations and this is our first break away from the kids since lockdown.'

Living it up at a club, Billie said: 'We are literally like mums on tour! I don't know about you but homeschooling', to which Jacqueline responded: 'There's no words'.

Jacqueline then confessed she was not forcing work too firmly upon Ella. 

 Woo! Billie and Jacqueline jetted to Ibiza for their In The Style promotions and thanks to The Mummy Diaries camera crew, the trip was documented

Shocker: Speaking in a confessional, Billie delightedly said to the camera: 'Really nice to have Jacqueline here with me. We're both mums in really similar situations and this is our first break away from the kids since lockdown'

She shares her beloved girls with her boyfriend Dan Osborne.  

She said: 'I've been doing bits. I feel like shes a five-year-old girl, I'm not gonna force her. When will we be in this situation again where they're at home when they shouldn't be and being cheeky and jumping into bed with us!'

When Jacqueline then admitted that she was driven to tears, Billie concurred and said: 'There's been times, I know it sounds silly and pathetic but the homeschooling - id go to bed feeling anxious thinking I'm not a teacher.'

In last week's episode of the show, Billie and her husband Greg Shepherd, 35, celebrated finally getting planning permission to transform their new Essex property.

Billie threw a decadent dinner party before the renovations kick off in the home, as she brought in party planners to help her organise the soiree.

Giving her followers a glimpse at the dinner party, Billie shared a series of snaps of the decorations as well as a loving snap of herself and Greg sharing a smooch.
