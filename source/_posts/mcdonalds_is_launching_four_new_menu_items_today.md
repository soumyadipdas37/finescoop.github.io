McDonald's has delighted fans by launching four new menu items.

Available in all UK stores today alongside the previously announced Triple Cheeseburger is the Jam Muffin, that starts at 99p as well as a  Dairy Milk McFlurry and a Cadbury Caramel McFlurry.

The ice creams are available in two sizes and cost 99p for a mini and £1.39 for a standard.

Also launching is a Dairy Milk McFlurry (right) and a Cadbury Caramel McFlurry. The ice creams are available in two sizes and cost 99p for a min and £1.39 for a standard

Last week, McDonald's announced they would be adding a triple cheeseburger to their permanent menu too. 

The 588 calorie treat, which starts at £2.19,  contains three beef patties made from British and Irish beef.   

Ardent fast food fans will remember the Cadbury McFlurry on the McDonald's menu before, but this is the first time they are making an appearance since April 2019. 

'To add a lighter bite to breakfast, the Jam Muffin will be available for 99p. The toasted muffin with jam has been on sale in Ireland for a number of years and will now be coming to the UK,' McDonald's said in a statement.

'Also returning to the menu tomorrow are promotional McFlurry flavours – in both regular and mini sizes, the Cadbury Dairy Milk and Cadbury Caramel – both firm favourites among McFlurry fans.'

The toasted jam muffin, which will be part of the breakfast menu served before 11am, is 211 calories while both the McFlurries are 342 calories each. 

The treats are available in McDonald's stores nationwide from today following a successful trial period of the Triple Cheeseburger in 60 Yorkshire restaurants earlier this year.

McDonald's fans in Yorkshire were amongst the first to sample the Triple Cheeseburger back in February when it was trialled across 60 restaurants

It is made of three patties made from 100 per cent British and Irish beef with onions, pickles, mustard and cheese, all in a soft toasted bun. 

Fans immediately took to social media in their droves to declare their love for the new menu option.

'Best burger ever,' said one.

'GAME CHANGER!' added another. 

While third said: 'I am ordering three, in advance, sorry to the guy on the grill,' 

McDonald's told FEMAIL to stay in line with Government guidance, social distancing and safety measures at restaurants remain in place. 

This includes hand sanitiser at every entrance for delivery couriers and dine-in and takeaway customers, table-service and contact tracing for customers who dine-in, and carefully managing the number of customers and crew inside each restaurant.
