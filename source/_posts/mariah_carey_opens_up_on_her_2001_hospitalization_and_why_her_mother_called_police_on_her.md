Mariah Carey opened up on her hospitalization in 2001 - and the real reason she believed her mother called police on her - in her new interview with Oprah Winfrey.

The 50-year-old singer was hospitalized in July of 2001 as her reps said she was dealing with 'extreme exhaustion.'

The Grammy-winning singer - who opens up about the tumultuous time in her new book The Meaning of Mariah Carey - told Oprah on The Oprah Conversation that her mother Patricia Carey, 83, contacted the authorities amid a family fight.

She said she was going through an 'emotional crisis' amid her promotional tour for her film Glitter, and was staying with her mother at the time.

'There was a code switching that happened and a power shift that was immediate,' the Hero singer said. 'It was immediate and she was in charge and instead of saying, "I'm taking care of my daughter, she's tired, somebody called the cops by mistake," or whatever, it was like, "Oh no, because you defied me, this is what's going to happen."'

The I Don't Wanna Cry singer said she felt a strange sense of relief when police arrived and she got into their vehicle.

'In the backseat of the police car, it's a vivid memory I'll never forget,' she said. 'I have never spoken about it, but at that moment, that seemed like a better alternative than where I was.'

Touch time: Carey said she was overworked in the summer of 2001 promoting her film Glitter 

Carey told Oprah that she didn't feel like she was in a 'breakdown mode' at the time, but rather overworked with her project Glitter, which was considered a critical and commercial failing amid Carey's vaunted career.

'If they had given me even two days,' she said, 'I would have gotten up, gone to the video shoot and made the video ... as we've seen in this entertainment industry, it happens.

'People push artists to the edge and then they wonder why people are gone too soon.'

In July of 2001, Carey left a message on her website in which she opened up about the chaos going on in her life at the time.

'What I'd like to do is just take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video,' she said, according to the AP. 'All I really want is to just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place … I don't say this much, but guess what, I don't take care of myself.'

She noted that Glitter's lack of success were not necessarily a result of her problems, but also awful timing, as it was released less than two weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

'That's not to say that would have made the difference and Glitter would have been some huge sensation as opposed to what happened,' she said. 'Let's not forget, it was September 11th. It's 9/11.'

The Meaning of Mariah Carey, is out on September 29, while she's slated to release a new album called The Rarities on October 2.
