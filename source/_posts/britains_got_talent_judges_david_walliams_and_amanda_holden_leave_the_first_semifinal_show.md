Britain's Got Talent judge David Walliams cut a weary figure as he left the first of the pre-recorded semi-final shows on Friday night.

The comedian, 49, was joined by fellow judge Amanda Holden, 49, who appeared in a cheerful mood as they made their way home from a long day of filming.

Also making his way home was new judge Ashley Banjo, 31, who had replaced a poorly Simon Cowell, with the dancer clearly ready for bed as he appeared to be surrounded by a plethora of pillows.

It had clearly been a busy day for David as he appeared a tad tired as he sat in his car alongside his beloved border terrier dog.

With Ashley clearly feeling the same way as he pulled a glum expression while staring into the distance.  

While Amanda appeared bright-eyed while carrying a huge bunch of flowers, following her first day as the newly promoted head judge. 

It comes after Ashley threw his support behind fellow judge Amanda's risqué live show looks.

The Diversity star insisted the presenter 'isn't changing for anyone' despite her sexy ensembles sparking backlash and even complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.

Ashley also hinted he'd 'love' to reprise his role as a judge on the BGT judging panel next series, after stepping in for Simon Cowell for this year's semi-finals after he broke his back in a bike accident. 

Asked whether Amanda will be ditching her usual risqué outfits for this year's semi-finals, Ashley told The Sun she has no plans to tone down her look.

He said: 'I don't see Amanda changing for anyone, let me tell you that. She looks good though, so you know what, go for it.'   

Last weekend, the BGT judges had the tough job of whittling down 200 acts to just 40 to appear in the ITV show's semi-finals. 

The pre-recorded episodes will air with some big changes to the usual format, most notably the absence of music mogul Simon, who is recovering after breaking his back in a shock bike accident.  

Speaking of his replacement Ashley, Simon told The Sun: 'Ashley will be a fantastic addition to the panel. He knows the power of the show and the responsibility of it.

'I couldn't think of a better person to sit in my seat whilst I follow doctor's orders. I hate that stupid bike.'

Clearly excited about his judging gig, Ashley added: 'As if 2020 couldn't get any crazier! Walking on that stage as a 20-year-old street dancer from East London and now I am walking out there and stepping in for the big man.

'It feels really nice, almost poetic.' 

Entertainment mogul Simon broke his back earlier this month after falling from his new Swind EB-01 bike at his Malibu home.

Although it had been hoped that Simon might be able to appear via video call for the already delayed shows, it has now been confirmed that he will not be seen at all.

Changes: Britain's Got Talent revealed a glimpse of the show's new socially-distanced judging panel ahead of the first semi-final this weekend

A source told The Mirror: 'It was decided that the idea of having him judge the BGT finalists via a link was just not feasible – nor sensible.

'Everything is fixed, he just needs healing time. Flying halfway across the world is not part of the plan and he has agreed to put his health first.'

The shows have already been hit by delays due to coronavirus restrictions. Although the audition episodes were shown in April the live finals had to be postponed.

Filming has also been changed to ensure that crew and acts can remain socially distanced and there is going to be a virtual audience.

Now instead of live shows, the episodes will be pre-recorded and shown in what would have been The X Factor's prime-time Saturday night slot.

The first pre-recorded Britain’s Got Talent semi-final airs Saturday 5th September at 8pm
