Chelsea defender Matt Miazga is set to link up with Manchester City legend Vincent Kompany at Anderlecht. 

According to Goal.com, Miazga will sign a season-long deal after he overcame a pre-season injury. It will be the 25-year-old centre-back's fourth loan spell away from the club, after spells with Vitesse, Nantes and Reading, with whom he made 20 appearances in the Championship last season.  

Miazga originally signed for Chelsea in January 2016, after coming up through the New York Red Bulls academy. However, he only made two Premier League appearances for the Blues that season and hasn't featured since. 

Matt Miazga has been with Chelsea for almost five years, but has only played twice for the club

CLUB                                    APPS (GOALS)

 2013-15 NY Red Bulls   42 (1)

2016 - Chelsea                 2 (0)

2016-18 Vitesse (loan)   72 (5)

2018-19 Nantes (loan)    9 (0)

2019-20 Reading (loan) 42 (2)

The United States defender has been capped 18 times by his country, and will join a side who are unbeaten in seven Belgian First Division matches so far, despite only having one clean sheet, under Kompany's management.

Miazga held positive talks with Kompany and he will soon join a long list of players who have been loaned out by Chelsea this season. 

Ross Barkley became the 20th player on that list when he joined Aston Villa on Wednesday, and that group could grow beyond 30 before the transfer window closes on October 5.

Chelsea are looking to offload a number of household names after spending around £240million on new faces in the transfer window. One of them is Tiemoue Bakayoko, who is in talks with Paris Saint-Germain.

Another is Antonio Rudiger. He's fallen out of favour with head coach Frank Lampard and been linked with the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Roma and Barcelona.

Michy Batshuayi, Davide Zappacosta and Ethan Ampadu are among the high-profile names to have been loaned out. They joined Crystal Palace, Genoa and Sheffield United respectively. 

Miazga made his US international debut in November 2015, and has gone on to win 18 caps
