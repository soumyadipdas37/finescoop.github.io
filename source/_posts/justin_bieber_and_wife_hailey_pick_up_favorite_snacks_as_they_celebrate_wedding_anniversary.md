Speaking about their marriage to Vogue a few months after they tied the knot, Hailey talked about the trials and tribulations of their union. 

'I'm not going to sit here and lie and say it's all a magical fantasy. It's always going to be hard. It's a choice. You don't feel it every single day. You don't wake up every day saying, "I'm absolutely so in love and you are perfect." That's not what being married is. But there's something beautiful about it anyway' she said.

Though their marriage has been marked with some strifes, there is certainly a lot of good as the pair appear to be attached at the hip.

'At the end of the day, too, he's my best friend. I never get sick of him' she said.
