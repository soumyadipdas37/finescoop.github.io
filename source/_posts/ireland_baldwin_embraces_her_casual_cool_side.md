She is used to glamming it up for photo shoots.

Ireland wore a pretty rose print face mask and an equally stylish pink scrunchie, which she used to contain her messy little bun.   

The star dressed up the dressed down look with a delicate gold necklace and coordinating ring.

In addition to grabbing breakfast with her friends, Ireland also checked out a vintage store in the area for some pre-worn goodies. 

The star was seen during the shopping venture wearing a black Harley Davidson tank top whilst enjoying a revitalizing iced coffee.

Ireland kept fans tuned into her fun-filled yet laid back day on her Instagram account, where she showed off a snippet of her $55 'vintage/thrift haul'.

She also shared a photo of the mouth-watering pancakes she had for breakfast.

Topped off with chocolates with a side of bacon and eggs, the meal looked absolutely delicious.

Horrific: Sharing two photos of her bruised face last month, Ireland revealed on Instagram: 'Yesterday in the late afternoon, I was attacked by a woman' 

'If you aren't having these, what are ya doin?' she captioned the snap.

Ireland is the daughter of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, whom were married for nine years.

This last month has been particularly eventful for Ireland.

While the model enjoyed a road trip to Oregon with her boyfriend, she was also the victim of a violent street robbery.

Ireland shared the harrowing tale on her Instagram account last month, where she also posted two photos of her bruised face.   

'Yesterday in the late afternoon, I was attacked by a woman who was high out of her mind on drugs and desperate for cash,' she wrote. 'She decked me in my face in a parking lot and took my belongings and jumped in a getaway car while her husband took off.

'All was sorted by police and she was arrest. Luckily I had witnesses and got assisted really quickly. The cops told me this is happening frequently because people are desperate for money right now due to Coronavius and people being out of work.

'There is a lot of theft and muggings going down. Posting this to remind everyone to be really careful and watch your surroundings. These are really difficult times and we need to look out for one another.'
