She's married to one of Hollywood's original hunks. 

Yet Hayley Roberts turned heads in her own right as she stepped out in a flesh-flashing ensemble to pick up groceries at Bristol Farms in Calabasas. 

The former shop assistant, 40, put her tanned and toned figure on display as she headed out with her bodyguard.

Offering a look at her sculpted stomach, the pretty blonde slipped into a neon yellow sports bra with cross strap detailing. 

She teamed the garment with denim hotpants that highlighted her tanned and toned pins, whilst a pair of pink Vans injected another splash of colour. 

Hayley completed the look with a black Under Armour cap and blue surgical face mask.

Although Hayley clearly keeps fit, her husband David recently admitted she struggles to keep up with him in the gym - despite being 27 years his junior.

The Hoff, 68, told Metro earlier this year, 'my wife goes, "You’re crazy, you work out so much." 

'But I pride myself on my appearance and if I look in the mirror and I see a roll of fat, I immediately do something about it. I want to put on a good show and if I look good, I feel good.'

Hayley and David have been married since 2018, when they had a romantic and lavish ceremony in Puglia, Italy.

They met back in 2011, when Hasselhoff was working as a judge on Britain's Got Talent. 

While in Cardiff, Wales for auditions, the former Baywatch star strolled into a store and was approached for a picture by Hayley, who was working as a shop assistant at the time. 

The former Knight Rider star has two daughters from his marriage to second wife Pamela Bach: Taylor Ann Hasselhoff, 30, and Hayley Hasselhoff, 27.
