Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood put a difficult two weeks behind him on Monday as he ventured out with teammate Teden Mengi in Cheshire.

The young striker looked relaxed in a white T-shirt and black shorts while shopping in Alderley Edge, just two days after his club kicked off their Premier League campaign with a 3-1 loss at home to Crystal Palace. 

Greenwood, 18, added to his casual look with a baseball cap and running shoes as he linked up with academy prospect Mengi, also 18, for a day out.

The appearance follows a bruising fortnight for Greenwood, who suffered the embarrassment of being axed from Gareth Southgate's  England squad after breaking the team's strict quarantine protocol. 

The striker was sent home with fellow England debutant Phil Foden after it emerged they had arranged for two young models to visit their hotel while on international duty in Iceland. 

The par received public admonishment from Southgate and a Football Association investigation after breaching the bio bubble set up to protect England players during their trip to Reykjavik.

Manchester United also publicly rebuked Greenwood for his behaviour on a trip that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær does not believe he should ever have been on, stressing that people “have to understand he’s an 18-year-old kid who needs managing”.

'Yeah, of course I speak to Mason and I’ve spoken to Mason,' Solskjær said. 'Of course what we speak about and discuss will be between the two of us. The kid had a fantastic season. He’s just come through.

'I’ve worked and the club have worked and all the staff here worked really hard.

'We gave Mason enough time on the pitch, we gave him exposure in the media. Then you come to the end of the season and we’ve had less than two weeks off and he’s called up to the national team.

'I have to be honest enough to say I tried my best to give him a rest over the summer. That the club we asked specifically and pointed out that he should have had a rest.

'He needs it mentally and physically after that season he had. First thing that happens is 1) he’s called up, and 2) he’s right there in the press.

'We’ve done whatever we can to protect him and I will keep on helping him. I know that when he comes back into the daily routine of the club and what we do to him, he’ll be fine.' 

Controversy: Greenwood and fellow England debutant Phil Foden were axed from the England squad in September for breaking the team's strict quarantine protocol
