A woman has lost an incredible four stone after ditching the takeaways in favour of healthier 'fakeaways' versions she makes at home. 

Lucy Robathan, 20, from Hinckley, Leicestershire, tipped the scales at 15 stone at her heaviest after starting a new relationship and ordering meals in almost every night as she curled up on the sofa with her new man. 

But the healthcare assistant was soon shocked into changing her ways after discovering none of her clothes fitted anymore.

She decided to improve her diet by recreating her favourite takeaways herself at home - such as creating pizza wraps, vegan kebabs, and McMuffin dupes - and dropped down to 11 stone after two years.

Lucy said: 'I have always felt uncomfortable with my body but I never had the motivation to do anything about it. I was bullied when I was younger for my weight but as you get older it stops.'

She added: 'I was very uncomfortable going out with my boyfriend, because he was so fit. When I got into a relationship I gained almost two stone. 

'I realised we would order takeaways on most days or go out for meals. I used to get fizzy drinks every day and binge junk food -I didn't really think about what I was eating.

'I found Instagram accounts and started calorie counting and making fakeaways. It was more of a lifestyle change for me rather than a diet, I didn't feel restricted at all.'

Lucy's fakeways included a 258 calorie plant-based kebab, a 307 calorie McMuffin fakeaway made with Quorn sausage patties and 250 calorie homemade pizza wraps. 

After she started preparing her meals more carefully and doing weight training four times a week, she finally hit her goal weight after two years.

She admits it was a confidence boost and says she feels more comfortable with herself now.

She added: 'It took me almost two years to get where I am right now, weight loss needs patience. I had a lot of people telling me I look great, ask me how I've done it and if I can share any tips.

'My advice for people trying to lose weight would be that it takes time, it doesn't happen overnight, don't be too restrictive.

'I think it's important to keep a balance, don't limit yourself too much and don't stop socialising because you are on diet.'

Lucy (pictured before her weight loss) suggested that the most important aspect when dieting was keeping the balance between your healthy options and your treats
