She's becoming quite the rising presence on social media, having amassed almost 150,000 followers – and counting – on her Instagram account.

And Sophia Peschisolido treated her followers to yet another delightful fashion post earlier this week, when she shared snaps of herself in a flattering white minidress.

The 23-year-old daughter of The Apprentice star Karren Brady, 51, posed up a storm in the summery number, which she teamed with a matching wide-brimmed hat.

With her blonde locks styled in a straight sleek blowout, the model highlighted her good looks with an impeccably-applied palette of makeup.

Teaming her PrettyLittleThing ensemble with a Louis Vuitton purse and a pair of white Nike Air Force 1 trainers, the brunette beauty posed up a storm.

Captioning the pair of scintillating snaps, Sophia wrote: 'Sunshine makes me happy.'

Sophia took a short break from social media last month, but returned in full force when she shared a sizzling swimsuit snap.

The model has since shared a plethora of images of herself posing in both swimwear and fashionable ensembles.

She recently declared she would never appear on Love Island, despite boasting a bikini body and sharing the same occupation as many former contestants.

The show has seen the likes of fellow influencers and models Molly-Mae Hague, Jourdan Riane and Molly Smith join the series.

However, Sophia insisted she'll not be following in the footsteps of past contestants from the beauty industry.

The celebrity offspring told MailOnline: 'I've been asked to go on loads of times but I've turned them down. I just don't want that kind of attention.'

Businesswoman Karren shares her daughter and son Paolo, 21, with ex-footballer husband Paul Peschisolido, 49.
