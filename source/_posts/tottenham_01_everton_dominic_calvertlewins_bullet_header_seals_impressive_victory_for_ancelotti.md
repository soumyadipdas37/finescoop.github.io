That concludes Sportsmail's coverage of Everton's 1-0 victory over Tottenham. Have a good evening, all!

Everton beat Tottenham in their opening match of the 2020-21 Premier League season. A bullet header from Dominic Calvert-Lewin was the only goal of the game, as the new signings in Cralo Ancelotti's side looked very comfortable in North London.

A flat, disappointing Sunday evening for Tottenham

Four added minutes. Allan deservedly wins man of the match of his Everton debut.

Goalscorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin makes way for Moise Kean.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin has another chance from a tough angle and can't beat Hugo Lloris after Abdoulaye Doucoure won possession. The Toffees have been far superior in midfield.

Richarlison is on the end of a nasty foul as Spurs heads start to go.

Tottenham have crossed a few dangerous balls into the box but Jordan Pickford has been brave coming off his line. Everton are being pushed back a little more but Spurs still cant create a proper chance.

Spurs are starting to attack with a bit more intent and win a corner after Lucas Moura tries to whip in a cross. The corner meets Harry Kane who can't direct the ball on target.

Richarlison has another chance which is almost a carbon copy of his one minutes before. Yet again, not enough curl from the Brazilian.

Seamus Coleman then blasts a volley towards goal but Lloris deals with it. It's all Everton as we head into the final 15 minutes.

CHANCE! Some good play down the left side for Spurs sees Ben Davies swing in a cross towards Lucas Moura. The speedster gets his head on it but he can't get the power.

Afterwards, Richarlison has a chance down the other end but can't get enough curl on his effort across goal.

Tottenham are struggling to bounce back after Calvert-Lewin's opener. They look frustrated as Everton continue to be more comfortable in possession. A couple chances fall to Son and Lucas but the Toffees deal with it easily.

GOAL! A beautiful delivery from Lucas Digne meets Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the box and he bullets a header into the top corner. Hugo Lloris had no chance and the visitors take a relatively well-deserved lead.

Another good move from James Rodriguez sees him set up Richarlison with a wonderfully weighted cross but the Brazilian can't convert with his head.

Andre Gomes has a chance moments later but it is blocked and goes out for a corner.

The second half has begun in a similar fashion to the first. Some quality possession from both sides but neither causing too many headaches.¬†

Dominic Calvert-Lewin finds James Rodriguez but he can't connect properly with the ball.

We are back underway for the second half. Moussa Sissoko has come on for Dele Alli.¬†

We are goalless after the first 45 minutes, but there have been plenty of positives for both teams; especially Everton. Their new boys have settled in quickly and James Rodriguez looks like a handful on the left-side.

Richarlison had the best chance of the half after he rounded Hugo Lloris but could not convert the ball into the empty net as he lost balance. Tottenham's new signing Matt Doherty also came close after some good interplay with Harry Kane - but chances have been at a premium in the first-half.

Richarlison manages to wriggle free from some defenders 20 yards out but his shot goes straight into the arms of Hugo Lloris.

CHANCE! Matt Doherty charged in field and gave the ball to Harry Kane. The striker then chipped the ball back to Doherty but he couldn't get the ball past Jordan Pickford. A good moment for Spurs but they could have scored.

CLOSE! The new boys link up as Abdoulaye Doucoure wins the ball in midfield and surges forward before passing to James Rodriguez. He sets himself and curls the ball just past the post.

WHAT A SAVE! Hueng-min Son times his pass perfectly to Dele Alli as Spurs counter attack and the Englishman unleashes a shot at goal but Jordan Pickford is on hand to tip it over the bar.

Son has a chance to try and curl a shot towards goal but the Everton defence manage to block his effort. A quick counter attack sees James Rodriguez cut onto his right foot but he can't get any power behind the shot.

Hueng-min Son puts in a very dangerous cross and Harry Kane cannot quite get his foot on the end of it.¬†

Moments after, some good link-up play involving Harry Kane sets Dele Alli free in the box but he can't find Son with the ball across. Some warning signs for the visitors.

Tottenham are now enjoying a long spell of possession. New boy Matt Doherty is sitting very high up the pitch in the right-back spot, leaving Spurs more exposed if Everton can fashion a counter attack.

A very even contest so far.

WHAT A MISS! Out of nothing, Ben Davies plays a poor pass backwards and Richarlison pounces on the ball and breezes past Toby Alderweireld. He then takes it past the keeper but cannot turn the ball into the open goal from a tight(ish) angle.

Everton are looking very comfortable in possession. After Son's early effort, Carlo Ancelotti's side have completely dictated the tempo of the match but are yet to fashion a chance in the final third.

Tottenham are now trying to assert themselves more in the match.

Some early tackles from Allan and passes from James Rodrguez will excite the Everton fans. Both have looked calm in the middle of the park so far.¬†

The Toffees enjoyed their first real spell of possession with Allan anchoring the attack. Rodriguez is finding little pockets and playing purposeful passes. Early stages but positive signs.

First attempt on goal for Tottenham comes from Hueng-min Son. The winger picks up the ball after a looping cross-field from Harry Kane and fires an attempt towards goal as he cuts inside. Jordan Pickford deals with it easily.¬†

Son is then straight back in the action as he almost gets in behind his opposite number Seamus Coleman, but the defender clears the danger.

We are underway as Spurs and the Toffees kick-off their 2020-21 Premier League season.

Both sides are now out in North London ahead of their Premier League opener. Plenty of new faces to keep an eye on for both Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti's sides.

The warm-ups are over and the final preparations are being made. Everton and Tottenham both have European qualification on their mind this season, but who can get off to a faster start at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium?

James Rodriguez starts for Everton after his shock move from Real Madrid, whilst Matt Doherty makes his first appearance for Tottenham.

Leicester City cruised to a 3-0 lead against newly-promoted West Brom with a Jamie Vardy brace and a debut goal from Tim Castagne.

There is a moment in Amazon's 'All or Nothing' documentary about¬†Tottenham¬†where¬†Jose Mourinho¬†ponders his arrival at the club.¬†

'It is only the second time I arrive at a club midway through the season,' he says. 'and it always means the club has problems'.

Spurs did indeed have plenty of problems. In many ways, Jose Mourinho walked into an impossible situation in north¬†London. He inherited a team made in the image of his predecessor, Mauricio Pochettino, but one that had gaping holes and had gone stale after more than five years of near-success under the Argentinian.
