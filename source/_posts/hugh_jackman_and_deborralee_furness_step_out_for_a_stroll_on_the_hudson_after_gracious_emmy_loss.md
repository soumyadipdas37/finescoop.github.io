Hugh and Deborra-lee were both smartly masked up to help stem the spread of COVID-19 during their early stroll.

The actor sported a pair of light grey pants, sneakers and a black hoodie with a large white square in the middle that read 'laughing man.'

Deborra-lee, meanwhile, kept it comfortable in an all-black ensemble of capri pants, a T-shirt and zip up hooded sweatshirt. Trotting alongside the couple were their two dogs. 

On Sunday night, Hugh participated in a first-of-its-kind virtual Emmy Awards telecast hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.

He was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role in Bad Education but lost out to Mark Ruffalo who played two characters in I Know This Much is True.

Due to the pandemic, nominees were streamed in to the show from all around the globe via professional production kits sent out by the Academy.

For the major awards, a crew member in a hazmat suit was sent to wherever the nominees were beaming in from with the golden Emmy statute - ready to present it if they won.

That meant even the losers of each category were able to glimpse the award that just slipped through their fingers.

Emmy's producer Phil Rosenberg was on such crew member who was dispatched to Jackman and Furness's multi million dollar Manhattan apartment. 

'Every single one of us were sent an Emmy, none of them were engraved,' Rosenberg told E! News. 'Only Ernst & Young knew who the winners were, they keep that under lock-and-key…We had to send [awards] to every person's house.'

Rosenberg said the team used a app similar to a Walkie-Talkie to communicate globally and only found out who'd won the category seconds before the presenter announced the name.

'Every single one of us were sent an Emmy, none of them were engraved,' said producer Phil Rosenberg - who was stationed at Jackman's apartment. 'Only Ernst & Young knew who the winners were, they keep that under lock-and-key…We had to send [awards] to every person's house.'

 'Before they went into the category, during a commercial break, there was a moment where all of the nominees got pushed into a Zoom together and they could chat,' Rosenberg explained. 'I overheard them congratulating each other.'

When Ruffalo was announced the winner of Jackman's category, Rosenberg said there is was a bit tense but ultimately the actor was gracious.

'They seemed great about it,' he said. 'They had a great time, they were the sweetest of people.'
