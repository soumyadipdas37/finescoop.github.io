She recently bid an emotional farewell to Studio 10, after being ruthlessly axed from the show last month.

But Kerri-Anne Kennerley appeared in high spirits on Tuesday as she celebrated her 67th birthday in style in Sydney.

The popular presenter struggled to walk in a pair of quirky stiletto heels as she sauntered down the street to have lunch with her pals in the city.

The blonde host - who is rumoured to be heading on The Masked Singer - complimented her choice of footwear with a pair of Pucci patterned trousers, which showed off her svelte frame beautifully.

She teamed the look with a white blouse, and wore an array of costume jewellery to add a hint of sass to the ensemble. 

Later, Kerri posted on her Instagram that she was enjoying a homemade birthday cake from her niece Adeline. 

She posed up a storm with the bright yellow dish on what appeared to be a restaurant rooftop.

Kerri-Anne was one of 25 employees to be made redundant from Channel 10 as a cost-cutting measure, last month.

Two weeks ago, she put on a brave face as she signed off for the very last time, thanking her co-hosts Sarah Harris, Angela Bishop and Joe Hildebrand for their continuous support over the years.

The media veteran also reflected on the tragic moment her late husband John died at the age of 78 last year after complications from a fall, and said the morning show and her co-stars 'saved her' from the depths of despair.

'Coming to work, literally saved me. You people, our audience, as well as you guys, literally saved me,' she said.

Kerri-Anne, who joined Studio 10 as a part-time panelist in September 2018, also recalled how her co-hosts left work early to support her at John's funeral in March last year.

She described it as one of the most 'beautiful moments' of her life.
