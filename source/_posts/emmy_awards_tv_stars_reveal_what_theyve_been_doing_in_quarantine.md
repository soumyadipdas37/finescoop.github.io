The COVID-19 pandemic and the quarantine lockdown that has been in place for many over the past six months was a hot topic of conversation during the Emmy Awards on Sunday night.

Host Jimmy Kimmel even had some fun with everyone's pandemic lockdown activities, with a brief segment where he asked several TV stars how they've been spending their lockdown. 

Stars who gave fans some humorous insight into their lockdown life include Will Arnett, Tatiana Maslany and The Bachelor host Chris Harrison.

Pandemic fun: Host Jimmy Kimmel even had some fun with everyone's pandemic lockdown activities, with a brief segment where he asked several TV stars how they've been spending their lockdown

The segment began with Kimmel stating, 'Many of us have been cooped up at home for months now, we've been passing the quaran-time in our own way.'

He added that they asked several TV stars, 'to share what they've been up to since everything went to hell.'

First up was Saturday Night Live star Kenan Thompson, who made some odd breathing gestures before admitting he's been 'riding my bike.'

The Bachelor and The Bachelorette host Chris Harrison was seen pruning a pile of roses, asking incredulously, 'What, you thought these things pruned themselves?'

The Good Doctor star Freddie Highmore added that, 'most actors have benefited from the fact that we should all be wearing a mask. They go outside and no one recognizes them at all.'

He added that in his situation, 'it's the exact opposite,' as he put on a medical-grade face mask, like he wears on his hit ABC sitcom.

Perry Mason star Tatiana Maslany added she has been, 'making wine in my bathroom toilet,' before taking a swig and admitting, 'It's not good.'  

The next segment came from the hit animated show Rick & Morty, with Rick saying he's just been 'wiping down groceries.' Morty asks Rick if he could do something about the pandemic and Rick says, 'Why would I? Do you know how much we're saving in mouth animation?'

Modern Family star Ty Burrell jokingly added, 'What have I been doing? More like who have I been doing?' with a laugh, before adding, 'I'm kidding. I'm married... but we totally did it.'

Mrs. America star Margo Martindale added she's been, 'spending a lot of time in quarantine working on my garden,' before pulling out a bottle of wine and drinking.

The Lego Masters star Will Arnett said from a sound booth he's been, 'really get to know myself,' adding that a lot of people say he's a real *expletive* and he doesn't know that side of himself, and it turns out they're right.

Breaking Bad and Your Honor star Bryan Cranston broke out his six Emmy statuettes, as he recreated their pose with a beach ball.

TV legend Bob Newhart revealed he 'gave up skydiving and quit my class in alligator wrestling, but that's pretty much it.'

The final segment was a parody of Tiger King, featuring David Spade dressed up as Joe Exotic, exclaiming, 'I've been in prison because of Carol f***ing Baskin you b***h!'
