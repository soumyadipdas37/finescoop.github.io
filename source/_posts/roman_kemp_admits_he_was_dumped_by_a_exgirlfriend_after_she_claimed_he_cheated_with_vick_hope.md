Roman Kemp has revealed that he was dumped by an ex-girlfriend after she accused him of cheating with his Capital FM co-host Vick Hope.

The DJ admitted that his former partner saw snaps of him helping to fix Vick's dress on a red carpet three years ago, and ended their relationship after becoming convinced that he was being unfaithful. 

In July Roman split from his girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury after three years together, with sources claiming their relationship went downhill after being 'unable to make things work' during lockdown.

That's not right! Roman Kemp has revealed that he was dumped by an ex-girlfriend after she accused him of cheating with his Capital FM co-host Vick Hope

Roman - who was not dating Anne-Sophie at the time - told Metro: 'We had to go to the MTV EMAs Vick and I, and on the red carpet, Vick's dress completely fell open.'

'Obviously I've seen it, so I've run over and helped her out, done up the back again. So that's what all the photos that ended up in the newspaper were, just me helping Vick do her dress up again.

'The girlfriend I had at the time, the Greek girlfriend who had no idea what I do or my relationships with anyone, saw this photo, flipped out and then didn't really like me again.'

Vick and Roman insisted they've been nothing more than close friends over three years of working together on Capital FM, before she quit the breakfast show earleir this year.

It comes after Roman was reported to have enjoyed a successful and 'tipsy' date at London's Soho House, according to The Sun on Sunday.

A mutual friend told the publication: 'They have known each other through the party circuit for a few years, but nothing has ever happened before.

'Roman's always thought she was beautiful, and decided to pluck up the courage to ask her out.'

Speaking about their successful date, the source claimed they kissed and said: 'They had a really fun, very tipsy date and have been in touch every day since.' 

The I'm A Celeb host and his neuroscientist girlfriend Anne-Sophie split up in July, after three years together.

The couple only moved in together in January but things went downhill during lockdown and they 'weren't able to make things work'.

Roman met the Swiss scientist on Tinder - and he is said to already back on dating apps to take his mind off the split.

A source told The Sun: 'Roman loved Sophie and things had been going really well for them. 

'But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.

'His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on [dating app] Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women.'

The couple had seemed inseparable- even co-owning a pet dog together, called Luna.
