Roman Kemp has reportedly made a staggering £1million since appearing on I'm A Celebrity last year. 

The Capital FM host, 27, who placed third in the series, is said to have boosted his bank account through a number of lucrative sponsorship deals and TV opportunities. 

Roman has managed to carve a career in the spotlight, following in the footsteps of his father Martin, 58, who is the bassist of Spandau Ballet.

Since starring in the hit ITV2 show, the radio host has become somewhat of a social media influencer, plugging advertisements on Instagram. 

Some of these include big name companies such as Cadbury's, Coca Cola, Smirnoff and Alpro.  

He also is starring in ITV2's new show Celebrity Karaoke Club and has a TV show at the weekend with his dad called Martin & Roman's Sunday Best!, with The Sun reporting he has managed to make £1million in the past nine months.

Meanwhile, Roman and the Gold hitmaker reportedly pocketed £12k to appear on Celebrity Gogglebox this series. 

The pair - who also featured on the series prior to the current one - are said to be paid £2k each per episode, for six episodes, and given a bottomless kitty to buy alcohol, treats and takeout dinners to feast on while watching TV on the show.  

'Getting on to Celebrity Gogglebox is an absolute coup for most stars because it has to be one of the easiest jobs around,' an insider told The Sun. 'You just sit and watch TV while having a good old chat — and get paid mega- money to do it.

'On top of the £2,000 per episode the pair pocket for taking part, there is also an unlimited kitty for constant takeaways, booze and snacks.

'It’s the best job on the box and it’s not surprising so many people are clamouring to take part!'

MailOnline has contacted Roman's representative and Channel 4 for comment.

It comes as Roman revealed that he was dumped by an ex-girlfriend after she accused him of cheating with his Capital FM co-host Vick Hope.

The DJ admitted that his former partner saw snaps of him helping to fix Vick's dress on a red carpet three years ago, and ended their relationship after becoming convinced that he was being unfaithful. 

In July Roman split from his girlfriend after three years together, with sources claiming their relationship went downhill after being 'unable to make things work' during lockdown.
