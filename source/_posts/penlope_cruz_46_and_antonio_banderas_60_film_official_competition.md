Penélope Cruz, 46, and Antonio Banderas, 60, returned to the set of their upcoming comedy Official Competition, after filming was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The movie, which first began shooting in March before being closed down just eight days later, has been tipped as one of 2020's most highest-profile international Spanish productions and filming is back on in Madrid. 

The esteemed Spanish stars put on a showstopping display as they took to the set, with Penélope looking incredible in an Eighties-inspired jumpsuit with backcombed hair while Antonio donned a suit.

Alongside the Hollywood heavyweights is a further dazzling cast including Argentine Oscar Martínez, who is a San Sebastian, Venice and Argentine Academy best actor award-winner, as well as two celebrated Argentina-based writers, Mariano Cohn and Gastón Duprat. 

In the movie, Antonio and Oscar play famous actors whose staggering egos come in the way of a movie they are filming under the expert eye of the director - played by Penelope.  

Looking more like the leading lady than a director, her character Lola Cuevas makes a showstopping appearance in the sizzling sequins which clung to every inch of her figure. 

She wore her hair in a voluminous backcombed style, with the sides slicked down, her character looked to have stepped out of a time machine as she rocked all the hallmarks of the 1980s.

Anthony meanwhile is set to play Félix Rivero, who was clad in a slick and stylish suit for the shoot.  

Director Gastón said in a press release: 'Within all the negatives of interrupting a shoot, there was something positive: We had an unusually large amount of time to study the already-shot material, and to put under a microscope the screenplay for what is left to film...

'The material we already have is wonderful: Penélope, Antonio and Oscar are extraordinary. The scenes have what we wanted, an uncomfortable mix of tension and sarcasm in an aesthetic framework of great conceptual strength. We restarted filming with the certainty that we have something really powerful on our hands'.

His fellow director Mariano added: 'In this film are the experiences and knowledge gained after so many years of shooting. The film has our DNA as directors, but also that of Penélope, Antonio and Oscar, as they generously contributed their own experiences....

'In this film, you will see an intense distillation of the universe that we know best: that of directors and actors trying to do one of the most unnatural and complex things, for me, in the world: Shooting a film.' 

Prior to filming, Penelope spoke about how she took up smoking after playing nicotine-addicted characters. The veteran actress found herself hooked on cigarettes after her characters in Blow (2001) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) indulged in the habit on camera.

After smoking for a 'few years', Penelope decided to quit to focus on achieving optimal health in order to have children, she told Stella magazine. The Spanish born beauty shares children Leo, nine, and Luna, seven, with actor husband of 10 years, Javier Bardem, 51. 

The two first met on set in 1992, but sparks did not fly until they starred opposite each other in Vicky Cristina Barcelona in 2008. 

Speaking to Stella magazine, Cruz shared that she led a pretty healthy life despite her shortcomings.  'I don't drink, I don't smoke and I eat really healthily... I've always taken good care of myself and maintained a healthy lifestyle,' she shared.
