Ed Sheeran made almost £100,000 a day last year, making him the third richest solo artist in the world behind Taylor Swift and Kanye West, annual figures have revealed.

Accounts released on Wednesday show his company, Ed Sheeran Ltd, made a gross profit of £36,456,811, equating to £99,881 a day.  

Sheeran, 29, who has a net worth of £200million and is the wealthiest British artist under 30, earned almost 55 per cent more than he did in 2018, when he made £23,770,262. 

Figures show the singer-songwriter has earned a staggering £87,603,273 since 2017, with the accounts also revealing he paid £6,931,700 in tax last year alone. 

Separate figures for total earnings before tax, costs and fees found Sheeran is the third wealthiest solo artist in the world after Taylor Swift and Kanye West, who made £143million ($185million) and £115million ($150 million) in 2019 respectively.

The musician, who has sold more than 150million albums worldwide, paid himself a wage of £10million in 2019, documents published on Companies House revealed. 

This is more than £7million less than in 2018, when he earned £17.1million.

It was reported last month that the musician, who has taken a two-year break from music amid the birth of his daughter Lyra Antartica, has grown a property portfolio worth £61million after purchasing new homes during lockdown.

The father has boosted his portfolio by £4.5million after making the cash purchases, according to The Sun.

Sheeran reportedly filed documents of the new purchases under his two firms, the Maverick Properties Limited and Maverick Commercial Properties Limited, with Companies House.  

In May, it was claimed the star had paid for his entire property portfolio with cash, leaving him completely mortgage-free.

The father has splashed £10million on the London property market over the years, growing his empire to 27 flats, houses, and mansions.   

A source said: 'He has a great portfolio of properties and he owns the lot free and clear. There was no need to borrow the cash from a lender because he already had it.

'Some people have the cash tied up so need to raise a mortgage but Ed has piles of the cash in the bank so there was no point in letting a bank earn money by lending him the money. He just bought them outright.'

He's also said to be making himself self-sufficient on his sprawling 16-acre Suffolk pile, by setting up a beehive on the edge of his estate, where he can make his own honey – in addition to growing vegetables, owning an orchard and raising livestock.

'Ed’s placed a wooden beehive at the edge of his estate,' another insider added. 'He’s already got other produce growing and some animals so he’s clearly enjoying the idea of that lifestyle.'   

In May, the singer-songwriter was officially named as the UK's richest musician under the age of 30.  

He owns 22 properties in London, including two homes on Floral Street in Covent Garden and a pair of flats by the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home down Palmer Road.  

These four homes alone are thought to be among his most expensive, with conservative estimates putting them at a total value of £9million.  

Sheeran also owns five apartments in Wiverton Tower in Whitechapel worth £3.9million and a mansion in Holland Park valued at nearly £20million.

The Shape of You singer has another four properties in Holland Park worth £11million, and a trendy Portobello Road restaurant called Bertie Blossoms which will soon be converted into a pub.

Outside of London, the musician owns a vast £3.7million Suffolk country estate dubbed 'Sheeranville' by locals.

After moving into a Grade II-listed farmhouse in his hometown of Framlington in 2012, Sheeran bought another four homes.

He has had a pub, a swimming pool, and a treehouse built, and last November submitted proposals to have a 'place of worship' constructed.
