Alesha, who has been secretly writing and recording a 'heartfelt' new album, has also revealed her plans to make it as a Hollywood actress after her big break on America's Got Talent.

The former Mis-Teeq star admitted that she is yet to finish her new album due to lockdown, but is 'definitely ready' to get back into the studio once it's safe to do so.

Speaking of her new music, Alesha told The Sun that she was on a roll before lockdown, saying: 'I was in the middle of writing some great, really authentic songs, really honest.

'Some of them were actually inspired by this whole craziness that's been going on in the world.

'I'm ready for the next record. I really want to make a heartfelt, honest record that really has something to say. I'm excited to get back, so fingers crossed.'

Alesha starred on the judging panel alongside Simon Cowell, Howie Mandell and Heidi Klum for AGT: The Champions earlier this year. 

And now, Alesha has dreams of using the stepping stone of featuring on American TV to break into the acting industry.

The judge told The Mirror: 'It was a dream of mine to work on American television. Everybody gets to a point where they get itchy feet, they want to try something new and be challenged.

'I like to step into an arena that makes me feel afraid – it's good for me. By stepping out of my comfort zone, great things come.

'I was really scared in the most amazing way. I can't wait for lockdown to be over so I can go back.'
