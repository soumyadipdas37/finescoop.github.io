Kelly Ripa's daughter Lola is worried that her mother might do something crazy on her 50th birthday which falls on Friday.

The 19-year-old student texted her morning show star mom that she better not to strip naked like Gwyneth Paltrow did to celebrate turning 48 on Sunday.

'You've been warned,' was all the brunette beauty told Kelly.

Ripa was the one who posted a screen shot of their text conversation to Instagram.

After Lola said mom had been warned, Kelly shot back: 'Oh lord. Honey. Do u what u want. Just know that I have a birthday also and an Instagram.'

Then dad Mark Consuelos popped into the conversation by saying, 'Lord.' 

Ripa and Mark together have daughter Lola as well as sons Joaquin, 17, and Michael, 23. 

 Paltrow shared a jaw-dropping snap of herself posing completely naked in a lush backyard on Sunday.

While the snap delighted countless fans, there was one Instagram user who was not amused - and that was her teenage daughter Apple Martin, 16.

'MOM', Apple hilariously commented.

The stunning snap captured Gwyneth posing with her body partially angled towards the camera.

Gwyneth was quick to respond to her teenager - and in the best way possible  - commenting three crying laughing emojis in response.

In the snap, the Goop maven strategically protected her modesty with her crossed arms and bent leg, yet did nothing to hide her envy-inducing toned stomach.

The Shakespeare In Love actress looked carefree as she smiled beneath the sunshine with her blonde locks worn down into loose, effortless waves.

In the caption, Gwyneth thanked everyone for their birthday wishes while also plugging her lifestyle brand Goop.

'In nothing but my birthday suit today... thank you all so much for the birthday wishes and thank you to @goop 's insanely amazing brand new body butter for making me think I can still get my kit off. #goopgenes' she captioned the snap.  

Last week Ripa and Consuelos provided scholarships to 20 homeless students in New York City.

The Live With Kelly And Ryan host and her husband have paid for laptops and scholarships worth $2,000 each for a total of 20 of the most vulnerable students who are headed to college in New York, according to People magazine.

Kelly and Mark's donation is being done in partnership with the Win foundation in New York, which 'provides safe housing and critical services to help homeless women and their children rebuild their lives and break the cycle of homelessness'.

In a statement, Kelly said: 'Mark and I are so excited to help these students in whatever small way we can. 

'Starting college is a pivotal moment for so many and being a part of this time is really special for our family. 

'We know each of these scholarship recipients has a bright future ahead and we can't wait to see what amazing things they accomplish!'

Several of the students who received laptops and scholarships are currently living in housing provided by the Win foundation, and didn't have access to a computer - which has been a vital tool to complete remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic - before the donation.

Kelly added in her statement: 'We were watching our kids, with all of their technology, and Mark and I said, "Learning remotely is so difficult … how are they possibly doing this at Win?" 

'Sure enough, they didn't have the Wi-Fi, tablets or other things they needed.'

For those receiving the scholarships, the good deed has been life-changing.

One recipient, named Michael Jones, said: 'Despite the fires that are currently ripping through the West Coast, I am still determined to attend Portland State University and major in Creative Writing there.

'The scholarship from Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos is a major help to my college career and will help me purchase books, dorm essentials and other necessities, which will put me in a strong position toward success in my freshman year.'

While Mikayala Garay added: 'As a student at SUNY Morrisville studying equine science to one day become a vet, I take classes off-campus at nearby stables. I'll use this money to buy books and to save up for a car to get to and from my classes off-campus.'
