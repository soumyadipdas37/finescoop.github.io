Lewis Capaldi made an appearance at the 2020 MTV VMAs in a pre-recorded performance of Before You Go.

The Scottish singer, 23, was seen performing on a red-lit stage with just a piano player behind him for the moving rendition of the ballad on Sunday.

Airing during the pre-show to the hotly-anticipated awards, Lewis gave it his all as he belted out the emotional song in the socially-distanced clip. 

Giving it his all: Lewis Capaldi belted out Before You Go in a socially-distanced studio for pre-recorded MTV VMAs performance on Sunday

Lewis kept his look simple for the performance as he teamed a long-sleeved black shirt with matching trousers.

Seemingly embracing a lockdown look, the singer wore his blonde locks in a loose tousled style that fell over her shoulders.

On Monday last week, Lewis chatted with MTV about his nomination in the Push Best New Artist category, which he lost to Doja Cat, and joked that being nominated for awards meant he could 'finally act like the diva I have always wanted to act like.'

Lewis joked: 'I'm talking no one gets to look me in the eyes, no one can come near me, if you so much as breath near me I will have someone tackle you to the ground.'

Lewis added that getting awards is always a good ice breaker on a date, especially because he still lives at home with his parents. 

He explained: 'If I am on a date or something and I say come up to my... well I live with my parents, but if I say come back to my parents place, which is already uncool, if I can saw look at my BRIT award that offsets how uncool it is on the date. 

'I do really appreciate it, I'm just a joker, but it's not the reason we do it, the reason is the money and the fame so as long as the bank balance just [increases] then I'm sweet,' he added, ever the comedian.

The MTV VMAs were filmed over days at several different locations with production abiding by social distancing guidelines as it aired 'live', with Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga on green screens from LA and Bella Hadid appearing in Brooklyn. 

The event was initially tipped to be hosted from Brooklyn's Barclays Center however a change in plans saw the show shifted to pre-records, despite MTV claiming much of the show would remain live. 

Earlier this month, it was announced that the VMAs would not take place at Barclays as initially planned, instead taking the festivities outdoors as a precaution against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The decision was reached mutually between both MTV and representatives from the large Barclays venue, who said in a statement:

Keeping safe: Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga also performed at the event, as they showed off their face masks while performing their hit song Rain On Me

Blinding: The event was filmed over days at several locations with production abiding by social distancing guidelines as it aired 'live', with Miley Cyrus using a green screen in Los Angeles

On the moon: Lady Gaga also appeared in an eye-popping nine outfits on the red carpet with her five moonpersons gongs, and she also appeared  in front of a green screen

'The 2020 VMAs paid homage to the incredible resiliency of New York with several outdoor performances around [the city] with limited or no audience, adhering to all state and city guidelines.

'In close consultation with state and local health officials‎, it became clear at this time that outdoor performances with limited or no audience would be more feasible and safer than an indoor event,' the statement continued.

'The VMAs will highlight the boroughs in an exciting show and return to Barclays Center in 2021. MTV will continue to work closely with the Department of Health, state and local officials, the medical community, and key stakeholders to ensure the safety of all involved,' the missive concluded.
