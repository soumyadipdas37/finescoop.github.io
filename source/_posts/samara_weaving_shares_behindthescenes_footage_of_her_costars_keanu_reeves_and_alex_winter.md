Meanwhile, Samara is currently filming her new Hulu series, Nine Perfect Strangers, in New South Wales' Byron Bay.

The series will see the rising star appear on screen alongside actors Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy, Michael Shannon and Bobby Cannavale. 

It is based on the 2018 novel by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty.

Samara recently told The Daily Telegraph channelling her emotions into characters helps alleviate her anxiety disorder.

Samara's parents first pushed her towards drama classes as a child, hoping she'd come out of her shell, but she still feels 'terribly awkward' in everyday life. 

'Oh, I am still terribly awkward. I have general anxiety disorder, so that's never really going to go away,' she said.

'But I am very grateful that I have an outlet for that, which is my job, so I can use these emotions. Sometimes it's a way to escape that, and it's very helpful for me.

'So that nervous, shy child I think is always there, but I have developed tools and methods to cope with it.'
