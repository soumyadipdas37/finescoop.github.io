Dan Evans has become the latest British player to fall at the US Open after suffering a defeat against Corentin Moutet which scuppered his dreams of reaching the third round.

Evans resumed the rain-delayed clash against his French opponent in the hopes of easing into the next stage for the fourth time, but the tempestuous star was left ruing missed opportunities.  

Despite moving into a 4-1 lead in the third-set tie-break, Evans slipped to an exit across four gruelling sets.
