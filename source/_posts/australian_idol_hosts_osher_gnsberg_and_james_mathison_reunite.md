It's been 12 years since Osher Günsberg (formerly known as Andrew G) and James Mathison hosted Australian Idol together on Channel 10.

But the duo have now reunited for the first time in more than a decade to film Drunk History Australia.

Their episode, which is available to stream on 10 Play, will air on free-to-air television for the first time later this month.

James and Osher reenact the disastrous expedition of Burke and Wills, as told by the inebriated comedian Harley Breen.

Osher told TV Week that the pair stayed in touch after James quit Australian Idol in 2008 and was replaced as host by Ricki-Lee Coulter.

'He comes to poker every now and then,' he said, adding that reuniting on screen with his old friend was 'the greatest'.

Osher went on to praise James' acting skills, saying he could have had a career as a sitcom star if he'd wanted to.
