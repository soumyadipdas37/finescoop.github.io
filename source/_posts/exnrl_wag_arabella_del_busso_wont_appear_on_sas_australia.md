'I'll never watch Channel Seven putting a loser like that on shows how much credibility they have,' one fan tweeted.

 'I, for one, will not be tuning in... Absolutely disgusted in your efforts for ratings,' another added.

'It's very controversial at the moment, but hey haters will hate,' Arabella said in response to the backlash.

On Sunday, News Corp reported the lingerie model was among the growing list of celebrities including convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby and publicist Roxy Jacenko.

The military-style program will see the contestants having to endure sleep deprivation, interrogation techniques and physical challenges.

To date, Candice Warner, Merrick Watts and Nick Cummins are the only celebrities to confirmed to be joining previously announced Roxy and Schapelle.
