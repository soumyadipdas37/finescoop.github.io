The Real Housewives of New York City star Leah McSweeney might not return for the 13th season, which starts filming in a week or two, after reportedly being offered a 'minuscule pay raise.'

'She made $3K per episode last season, which netted her about $60K,' a source told TMZ on Tuesday.

'She feels disrespected. Leah is holding out for an offer she feels is more deserving, considering what she brought to the table in her debut season, and she won't return until she gets it.'
