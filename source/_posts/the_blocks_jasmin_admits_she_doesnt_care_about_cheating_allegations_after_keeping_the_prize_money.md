Just a day after they were accused of cheating on The Block, Luke and Jasmin addressed the scandal during Wednesday's episode. 

When asked how they were feeling the day after their tense confrontation with judge Shaynna Blaze, the couple claimed they weren't overly concerned.

'Well, we're still pretty happy, because we've still got $8,000 in our bank account,' said a smug Jasmin, 36.

She added: 'Shaynna may have come and had a chat, but the upside is we've still got the [prize] money in our account.

'We've still got the beautiful room that I dare say our buyer's going to fall in love. They're not going to go, "Oh, well, you know, that looks very similar to another room I once saw..."'

Luke, 35, described Shaynna's remarks as 'constructive criticism', but admitted he was 'feeling a little deflated' after being called out.

'We definitely do not want to come off as copycats,' he added.

The 57-year-old judge accused Luke and Jasmin of cheating during a tense conversation during Tuesday's episode. 

Shaynna told Luke and Jasmin that she had some concerns about their winning kids' bedroom, after discovering they'd completely ripped off their design.

While Shaynna initially thought they had taken inspiration from former Block contestants Kyal and Kara, she said she went home and did some 'fishing'.

'It felt familiar, and then I found this,' she said, before pulling up a series of comparison photos on a tablet.  

Luke and Jasmin's idea for their kids' bedroom had completely come from the pages of interior design magazine, Inside Out, with Shaynna pointing out all the similarities.

'You're calling it inspiration,' continued Shaynna. 'What happens is inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another.'

Shaynna explained that it was one thing for them to copy a design for their own home, but she reminded them that they were in a competition.

'You haven't changed it up enough. It's not fair on the other contestants that they can win a room, with money, on someone else's ideas,' she added.
