She's never been shy of displaying her eye-popping physique.

And Love Island star Anna Vakili was once again displaying her incredible curves as she enjoyed a night out with her sister Mandi and their pals on Friday.

The reality TV star, 30, opted for a skintight nude mini dress as she headed into the London hot spot 100 Wardour St with her group of friends.

Anna put on a leggy display in the skintight nude dress, which she teamed with thigh-high snakeskin boots.

She also showed off her newly-dyed brunette tresses for the night out, with her essentials in a small black clutch bag.

Mandi also didn't hold back in displaying her own curves, and flaunted her ample cleavage in a plunging nude cardigan and cycling shorts.

The siblings were joined by a group of female pals for the fun-filled night out, including several of their former Love Island co-stars.

In October, Anna, who returned to her pre-reality fame job as a pharmacist amid the COVID-19 pandemic, spoke about the perks of her newfound celebrity. 

'I’m very grateful for all of the things that have come my way, but the best thing about it is my mum doesn’t have to work anymore,’ she told New magazine. ‘There have definitely been more ups than downs.’  

Anna had been soaking up the sunshine in the French Riviera, making luxurious stops in Monte Carlo and Saint-Tropez last week.

During her trip she has shared a selection of sizzling bikini snaps of her making the most of the warm weather.

Among the footage, Anna was seen holding onto the arm of a mystery man donning a white top, whose face she ensured wasn't shown on camera. 

She also recently raised eyebrows when she shared bikini snaps of herself with the caption: 'The only pictures my man takes for insta are my ones' suggesting she may be enjoying her summer break with a new beau.
