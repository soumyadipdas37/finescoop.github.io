Reese's has unveiled a decadent peanut butter-flavoured ice cream, sandwiched between two chocolate cookies.

Australian shoppers can find the ice cream sandwiches in the freezer aisle at Coles, available in a pack of three for just $8.50, about $2.83 each.

The creamy dessert consists of the brand's famous peanut butter cups, which are finely grounded and blended into the silky smooth ice cream.

One foodie who tasted the new creation rated the treat a nine out of 10, adding the brand was very generous with its peanut butter.

The new sandwich joins the Reese's range of ice cream in supermarkets.

Among the $8.50 peanut butter chocolate-flavoured products are the ice cream tubs, four pack of ice cream sticks and a four pack of cones.

Earlier this year, a Melbourne snack reviewer shared their glowing reviews on the brand's popular ice cream cones.

'I had the tub version and absolutely loved it. So, the cone version was a no brainer,' the founder of Neko Snacks wrote on Instagram.

'Peanuts on top, peanut butter ice cream, chocolate ice cream, chocolate drizzle over the top and an inner peanut butter core. 

'The flavour is so damn good. It's salty, sweet, nutty, chocolatey plus the cone adds an extra delicious dimension to it all. Plus that thick PB core is just amazing.'
