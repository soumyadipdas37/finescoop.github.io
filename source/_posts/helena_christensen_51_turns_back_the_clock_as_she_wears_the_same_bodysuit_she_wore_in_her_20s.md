Her highly successful modelling career has spanned over 30 years, having began when she won the Miss Universe Denmark title in 1986.

And Helena Christensen turned back the clock on Tuesday as she slipped into the same bodysuit she modelled in her twenties back in the 1990s.

The Danish beauty, 51, looked sensational as she showcased her incredible figure in the leopard print number by Christian Lacroix, which she first wore in 1994 after a runway show in Paris.

Still got it: Helena Christensen turned back the clock on Tuesday as she slipped into the same bodysuit she modelled in her twenties back in the 1990s

Taking to Instagram, the model was keen to show her followers that she could still slip into the slinky black and gold number from over 25 years ago. 

Helena looked sensational as she perched seductively on a huge rock, putting her long, slender pins on full display.

She finished off her look with black ankle boots from her own collection, while she added a further touch of glam with bold red lips and her brunette locks worn in tousled waves.  

At one point, she even posed with her dog as she modelled the bodysuit near her home in the Catskill Mountains in New York State.

She also shared throwback snaps of herself in the Christian Lacroix bodysuit in her mid 20s as she walked the catwalk in Paris.

Captioning the image, she penned: 'One of my favorite designers ever, Christian Lacroix gave me this bodysuit with my portrait on it after I wore it in one of his shows in my early twenties and I just found it again. 

'Somehow it made it through all these years and I still think it’s super cool ♥️ ps very stretchy fabric.'

She went on to become one of the original 1990s supermodels alongside Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Elle Macpherson and Claudia Schiffer.   

Since her break into the fashion industry, Helena also has become an accomplished photographer and was a co-founder of Nylon magazine that published from 1999 to 2017. 

Last year, the stunning model spoke to the Daily Mail about some of the fitness secrets that have helped her maintain her bombshell figure.

'I think it's important to shake it up and do as many different forms of workout as possible, but also to incorporate nature into them,' she said.

'Swim in the ocean, swim in rivers, swim in lakes. Hiking, trekking, chopping wood – it's the best way of working out, because it doesn't really feel like a workout. It feels like you're alive,' Helena explained. 

Last month, Helena revealed that spending lockdown with her 20-year-old son Mingus had been 'really special'.

The model quarantined with her only child and close friends at her home in the Catskills, in upstate New York.

Speaking with The Telegraph, she explained how they passed time going on treks and watching films, adding that 'being in nature saved me physically and mentally'.

Helena said: 'I was lucky to spend months on end [in lockdown] with close friends and my son Mingus.... it was very special.

'I think nature saved me physically and mentally. Being in nature I realise is as important to me as breathing.’

Helena shares her son with her ex-partner the American actor Norman Reedus, who is known for his role in The Walking Dead. The couple were together for five years but split in 2003.

Mingus, who is with the Unsigned Group modelling agency, is also making a name for himself in the fashion industry after walking in several high profile runway shows.
