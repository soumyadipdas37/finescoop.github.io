Jason Momoa hit a mild setback on a road trip through the desert on Thursday when his car broke down. 

The 41-year-old actor shared new videos on his Instagram, the first of which was captioned '110 broke down.'

The Aquaman star even asked his fans to send more Manalanu Water while he waited, but he ultimately got back on the road shortly thereafter.

Momoa started his shirtless video while wearing a pair of black sunglasses, along with black and white striped pants and flip flops.

He also showed a few bottles of Manalanu Water on the concrete, while a few semi trucks drove by him.

The next video was captioned that the car breaking down is, 'the only way to slow me down' while he spoke about the breakdown.

'Well, sitting on the side of the road, broken down... it's 110 degrees out here,' Momoa said, before showing under the hood of the vehicle.

'God damn radiator,' he said, while captioning the next video, 'I love the desert catching some rays and enjoying the time alone just me and @colterwall.'

He then sent out a plea to 'send more Manalanu Water,' while showing the two empty cans on the side of the road.

Thankfully, he wasn't stranded for long, sharing a new video an hour later where he was on the road again... while listening to the Willie Nelson classic On the Road Again.

'On the roam again life I love is making movies with my friends,' he captioned the post, slightly modifying the original lyric of 'making music with my friends.'

Momoa also said in the video, 'my boyfriend fixed my car,' pointing to his passenger @toddstopera.
