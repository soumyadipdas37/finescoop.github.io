Actor Jason Momoa has backed Ray Fisher's bullying allegations against the director of Justice League and lashed out at Warner Bros. for trying to 'distract' from them.

Momoa said the studio made a 'fake announcement' about a new role for him in an upcoming Frosty the Snowman movie to draw attention away from the allegations against director Joss Whedon.

Fisher, 33, has alleged 'gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable' behavior by Whedon which was 'enabled' by producers Geoff Johns and Jon Berg during reshoots of the 2017 movie.

Momoa, renowned for his Khal Drogo role in Game of Thrones, made a furious Instagram post on Monday claiming that 'serious stuff went down' which 'needs proper investigation.'

Momoa, renowned for his Khal Drogo role, made a furious Instagram post on Monday claiming that 'serious stuff went down' which 'needs proper investigation.'

Investigation: 'THIS S**T HAS TO STOP AND NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT,' Momoa began. '@ray9fisher AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO EXPERIENCED WHAT HAPPEN UNDER THE WATCH OF @wbpictures NEEDS PROPER INVESTIGATION'

The 41-year-old posted: 'THIS S**T HAS TO STOP AND NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT @ray9fisher AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO EXPERIENCED WHAT HAPPEN UNDER THE WATCH OF @wbpictures NEEDS PROPER INVESTIGATION.

'I just think it's f****ed up that people released a fake Frosty announcement without my permission to try to distract from Ray Fisher speaking up about the s****y way we were treated on Justice League reshoots. 

'Serious stuff went down. It needs to be investigated and people need to be held accountable. #IStandWithRayFisher. aloha j.'

Momoa was referencing a Frosty the Snowman movie he is voicing, which Warner Bros. revealed on July 1.

Toxic work environment: The Justice League star aired his grievances against director Joss Whedon back in July, accusing him of 'abusive and unprofessional' behavior (pictured in September, 2018)

It is not clear if the news was entirely 'fake' but he claims it was in an effort to distract from Fisher's allegations, which were first revealed in a series of tweets on July 1.  

Fisher wrote: 'Joss Whedon's on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable.

'He was enabled, in many ways, by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg.

'Accountability>Entertainment.'

Berg has said that it was 'categorically untrue that we enabled any unprofessional behavior'. 

Johns and Whedon are yet to address Fisher's claims publicly. 

However, the tweet led to Warner Bros. launching an official third-party investigation into what happened on the Justice League reshoot set, though reports surfaced earlier in September that Fisher was not cooperating with the investigation.

Fisher seemed to address his lack of cooperation as well, tweeting on Monday, 'To-date, the 'independent' firm hired by @wbpictures has conveniently avoided contacting key witnesses who gave damning statements to WB HR.'

'They've also started interviews with (and have since ghosted) witnesses that have implicated former and current top level executives,' he added.

'Others (including an implicated individual that called me to apologize) have already been interviewed. We will not let ANY investigator cherry-pick interviewees that best suit @wbpictures' false narrative and scapegoating efforts. All with stories WILL be heard! A>E,' Fisher concluded.  

Not Frosty: The Frosty the Snowman news was reported by several press outlets, with the movie, coincidentally, produced by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg, who Fisher called out in his original tweets

Fake news: Fisher also reiterated that the news of Momoa voicing Frosty the Snowman was always fake, despite it being widely reported in the press, in a tweet on Monday

Whedon took the helm to oversee post-production and reshoots on Justice League in May 2017 after previous director Zack Snyder left due to a death in the family.

He also directed The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Berg and Johns served as producers on the movie but left their roles at the head of DC Films unit after its poor performance. 

According to Variety, the movie grossed just $657.9 million worldwide, leading fans to call for a Snyder-only cut.

He obliged in May announcing that it will be released on HBO Max in 2021. 

No sellout: 'To think they believed my brother would sellout the cast/crew of JL for a corncob pipe and a button nose...Man facepalming A>E,' Fisher concluded

Abusive: Then on July 1 Fisher tweeted, 'Joss Wheadon's on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable. He was enabled, in many ways, by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg. Accountability>Entertainment'

Hollywood Reporter states that one of the larger difference between the Whedon and Snyder cuts of the movie is that the original director featured more of Fisher's character and his father Silas Stone, played by Joe Morton.

Fisher had praised Snyder earlier this month for casting him as the hero Cyborg/Victor Stone.

'I don't praise [writer] Chris Terrio and @ZackSnyder for simply putting me in Justice League,' Fisher wrote on June 6.

'I praise them for EMPOWERING me (a black man with no film credits to his name) with a seat at the creative table and input on the framing of the Stones before there was even a script!'

Justice League also featured Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Ben Affleck as Batman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, and Ezra Miller as The Flash. 

Investigation: Fisher seemed to address his lack of cooperation as well, tweeting on Monday, 'To-date, the 'independent' firm hired by @wbpictures has conveniently avoided contacting key witnesses who gave damning statements to WB HR'

Stories: 'Others (including an implicated individual that called me to apologize) have already been interviewed. We will not let ANY investigator cherry-pick interviewees that best suit @wbpictures' false narrative and scapegoating efforts. All with stories WILL be heard! A>E,' Fisher concluded
