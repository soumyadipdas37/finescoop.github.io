Families are ditching their inner-city apartments for suburban homes by the ocean during the coronavirus pandemic. 

Over the last 12 months, homebuyers in Sydney have increasingly opted to search for properties near beaches, reserves or national parks and away from the CBD.

The realestate.com.au study of 'high intent' buyer activity online discovered beach areas to the far north and south of Sydney were among the most popular suburbs.

Wamberal on the Central Coast was identified as the most in-demand suburb with homebuyers - despite being more than 80 kilometres north of Sydney

A spike was also recorded in south-western suburbs, with buyers snapping up homes in Leppington, Austral and Gledswood Hills. 

Inquiry levels for these suburbs had doubled when compared to a year earlier, as they have sufficient properties eligible for government buyer grants. 

Nerida Conisbee, the chief economist at Realestate.com.au, said the demand for house and land packages in the city's outer suburbs was growing. 

'It's clear that a longer commute doesn't bother people as much as it might have before, which makes sense if you're only going into the office once or twice a week,' Ms Conisbee said.

'First homebuyers seem to be more willing to purchase house and land packages in fringe suburbs and more people want space.'

Wamberal on the Central Coast was identified as the most in-demand suburb with homebuyers - despite being more than 80 kilometres north of Sydney.    

Prospective buyers looking for a home in the suburb would be less than a kilometre from a waterway, with Wamberal Lagoon or Wamberal Beach nearby.

The research found buyers seeking to acquire a unit were also searching areas close to water, including Freshwater, Kirribilli and Cammeray.

Ms Conisbee suggested spending more time at home during the coronavirus crisis may have encouraged families to prioritise lifestyle over accessibility when buying a home.
