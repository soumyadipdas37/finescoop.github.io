From Tracey Jewel's bizarre love triangle to Carly Bowyer and Troy Delmege's PDA-filled fling - Married At First Sight Australia kept fans on the edge of their seat back in 2018.

And it was English viewers' turn to have their minds blown as the season's reunion episodes played out on UK's E4 television network this week.  

Droves of English fans have expressed their disbelief onTwitter after witnessing jaw-dropping twists, including Tracey's unexpected fling with Sean Thomsen.

Tracey, who was initially paired with Dean Wells, sent jaws dropping as she flaunted her steamy fling with Sean - who previously dumped 'wife' Blair Rachel - at the reunion.  

The drama reached fever pitch when Dean accused Tracey of sending him raunchy texts behind Sean's back.  

'Sean and Tracy! I'm sitting down but I feel like I need to sit down! I did NOT see that one coming!' Tweeted one floored UK viewer.
