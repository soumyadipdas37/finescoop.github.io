It's no secret that the Married At First Sight experts have had little success matching couples during their time on the show.

And it appears producers have decided to shake things up by introducing a new face on the expert panel.

Dr Trisha Stratford will be replaced by a 'sex therapist', Daily Mail Australia can reveal.

A production insider has revealed the neuropsychotherapist has decided to part ways with the experiment after five years of service.

According to the source, the New Zealand based therapist was notably missing during the second and third stages of castings last week.

Instead, participants were introduced to an 'American female sex therapist' who asked each of the stars what they were hoping to find in a match.

For the first time, the show's relationship experts will be forced to meet the loved-up hopefuls via Zoom due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier this year angry fans expressed outrage over the role, or lack thereof, Trisha, and fellow experts John Aiken, Mel Schilling played in the 2020 season. 

Many were perplexed by the shortage of advice the trio gave to the struggling couples and 'dud' pairings.

Trisha doesn't fare much better when it comes to interviewing the participants in previous seasons.

In the past she has often asked one or two questions, usually about sex, before letting John and Mel take over the conversation.

Earlier this month, it was revealed producers have decided not to cast any Victorians this season after the state recorded a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Nine for comment.
