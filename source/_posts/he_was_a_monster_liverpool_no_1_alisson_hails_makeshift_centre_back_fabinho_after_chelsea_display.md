Alisson Becker has praised fellow Brazilian Fabinho for his 'unbelievable' display against Chelsea on Sunday. 

With Joe Gomez and Joel Matip unavailable, defensive midfielder Fabinho sat in at centre back and played superbly, nullifying Timo Werner and guiding the Reds to a clean sheet during the 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge. 

And compatriot Alisson, who saved a second-half penalty from Jorginho to preserve the Reds' two-goal lead, was complimentary of Fabinho's performance, speaking to the official club website. 

Fabinho filled in at centre half for Liverpool against Chelsea and was named man of the match

Fellow Brazilian Alisson Becker was full of praise for his countryman after his performance

'He [Fabinho] was a monster! Unbelievable, but it's what I expect of him,' Alisson said. 

'If it's a surprise for you I would be surprised, because he is a top player. 

'Anywhere he played, from number six or centre back, he always does his best and his quality permits him to play in different positions.

'He's a really smart player on movements and also one-v-ones. That was needed against [Timo] Werner, against [Kai] Havertz and the other players with really good quality, so I congratulate him as he was in my opinion man of the match.' 

Fabinho dealt admirably with Chelsea's attacking threats in the Premier League on Sunday

The victory on Sunday also saw £20m signing Thiago Alcantara make his debut, following his move from Bayern Munich last week. 

Yet it was Thiago who fouled Werner in the box to hand Chelsea a lifeline - but the usually dependable Jorginho could not outfox Alisson from the spot. 

'I'm really happy because in the Community Shield we lost on penalties,' Alisson explained. 

'When the goalie doesn't save any penalties you stay a little bit down and then you think, "I could do more, I could do it differently."

Alisson's save from Jorginho's penalty preserved Liverpool's clean sheet at Stamford Bridge 

'But the secret is to keep on going, to know that you are in a good direction, in the right direction, working hard and we did it together – me, John [Achterberg], Jack [Robinson], and all the video team who help us a lot.

'Also with the rebound, Millie [James Milner] and Virg [van Dijk] did really well and I think they showed confidence in me that I would save the penalty.'

Both Brazilians could be rested for Liverpool's next game - a Carabao Cup third round clash at Lincoln on Thursday.
