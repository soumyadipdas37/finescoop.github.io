She was husband Justin Bieber's go-to model when he launched his streetwear line Drew House in 2019.

And Hailey Bieber rocked the brand's cloth face mask, while running errands with the 26-year-old pop star in Beverly Hills on Thursday afternoon. 

The 23-year-old daughter of Stephen Baldwin kept the majority of her makeup-free face concealed behind her Drew mask as she returned to the couple's Porsche.

She showed off her runway-ready stems in an oversized black hoodie that featured artwork of an eagle on the back.

Hailey completed her look with a pair of neon yellow and green Nike kicks and some white crew socks.

The Baby singer dressed his 5foot9inch frame in a black hoodie and coordinating basketball shorts.

Testing it out: During their outing on Thursday, Hailey took to Instagram to try out one of Instagram's most popular filters

During their outing on Thursday, Hailey took to Instagram to try out one of Instagram's most popular filters.

She had on her oversized black hoodie, but her golden hair was tied up into a messy bun that let some of her bangs hang down.

The fun filter places a set of Disney-inspired animated eyes onto all those that enter the front camera's frame.

Date night: On Wednesday evening, the couple, who are inching closer to their two-year anniversary, were spotted grabbing dinner at the swanky Japanese joint Nobu in Malibu

Model behavior: Hailey looked every bit the model, while donning a pair of linen shorts and a matching button down top

Hailey liked the filter's effect enough to share it with her 29million followers on the platform. 

Despite the perils of the pandemic, Hailey and Justin have continued to keep all aspects of romance alive in their marriage. 

On Wednesday evening, the couple, who are inching closer to their two-year anniversary, were spotted grabbing dinner at the swanky Japanese joint Nobu in Malibu.
