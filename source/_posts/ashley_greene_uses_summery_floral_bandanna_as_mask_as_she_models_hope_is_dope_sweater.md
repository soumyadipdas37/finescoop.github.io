She shot to fame as a vampire in the Twilight Saga.

But Ashley Greene gave off a much less Gothic and much more summery vibe when she was spotted in Beverly Hills this week.

The 33-year-old actress wore a colorful floral bandanna as a face mask when she emerged from lockdown that day.

She also made an upbeat fashion statement by slipping into a black and white Hope Is Dope sweater on her latest outing.

Sweeping her dark hair back, she slipped into a pair of fashionably faded jeans and rounded off the look with snappy black boots. 

The Twilight Saga propelled Ashley to international recognition as Alice Cullen, one of the sisters of Robert Pattinson's Edward Cullen.
