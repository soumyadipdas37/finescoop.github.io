Luis Suarez was shoved out of the door at Barcelona by new boss Ronald Koeman but the Uruguayan looks to have made peace with it, insisting that 'sometimes it's important to have a change'. 

Suarez left Barcelona's training ground in tears last week before agreeing a deal to join their LaLiga rivals Atletico Madrid.

But after producing a brace as a substitute on his debut against Granada in a 6-1 win, Suarez is clearly keen to look forward, rather than back.  

Luis Suarez is ready to mark the next chapter of his career after a debut brace for Atletico

The Uruguayan was pushed out the door by Barcelona but looks to thrive at one of their rivals

'For a player, sometimes it's important to have a change,' Suarez said.

'I'm coming to a club that has given me a spectacular welcome. You feel it in the atmosphere, you get a good impression from the start and that is seen on the pitch.

'I'm very happy with my debut and even happier at getting the three points in our league opener.

He was bearing a big smile having scored twice coming off the bench in the rout of Granada

'Every time you make your debut and help the team with goals, you're going to be happy, but we'll see in the future because it's a long season.'

For his new boss Diego Simeone, it was not the goals he produced off the bench that made Suarez stand out after he was introduced with 20 minutes to go in the second half. 

'His two goals didn't stand out for me, but his assists, his runs and his movement did,' Simeone said.

'The changes gave us a bit extra with the strength of Marcos, the quality of Vitolo, the clarity of Thomas [Partey] and Suarez knows what he has to do: play for the team.'
