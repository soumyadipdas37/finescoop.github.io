Lee Henderson has missed out on purchasing a $5.5million semi in Sydney's Vaucluse, a new report claims. 

According to Domain, Jackie 'O' Henderson's ex husband, 40, bid on the two bedroom property, which started at $3.3million, but was unsuccessful. 

It was the first time the 316-square-metre block had gone on sale in 45 years, and it fetched $2million above the reserve.

While Lee missed out on a nearby property, Jackie, 45, has snatched up an $11million home in Woollahra, Sydney, known as Cooper Park House.
