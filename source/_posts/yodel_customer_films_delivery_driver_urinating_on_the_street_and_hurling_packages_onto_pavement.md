This is the moment a delivery driver was caught on camera 'urinating' on a street in front of passing cars. 

Yodel customer Tat Jana had been waiting for her delivery at home in Coventry, West Midlands, yesterday when she spotted the unnamed man.

The driver, who is believed to work for Yodel, appeared to duck behind a car door to relieve himself before driving off and leaving behind a puddle of liquid. 

She also caught the man tossing parcels into the path of oncoming traffic as he attempted to sort his deliveries.

In the first clip, the courier can be seen standing in the street with dozens of parcels strewn across the floor.

He rummages around in the boot of his blue car as he rearranges packages and throws some more to the ground. 

A passing car narrowly avoids flattening a mass of boxes as it attempts to squeeze down the road.

In a second video, the driver has placed the packages back into his vehicle and is leaning against the passenger side of his car with the door open.

A woman and young girl work past the car before the driver appears to relieve himself. 

He looks around constantly before eventually emerging from around the side of the vehicle as he readjusts the crotch of his trousers.

The man then gets in his car and drives away but leaves behind a wet patch which is seen trickling into the road.

Ms Jana took to a Yodel complaints group earlier today to share her experience.

She posted the videos saying: 'I was waiting for my package yesterday. Looked out the window so as not to miss' with angry emojis.

Her post has horrified fellow group members as one wrote: 'Ewwww nice, not.'

Another added: 'What a dirty and disgusting article that driver is, tut.'

And one man said: 'What the actual f***? So grim.'

Speaking afterwards, Ms Jana added: 'I was in shock, people are waiting for their parcels and he throws them on the sidewalk.

'You can see him go to the toilet too.

'I saw him on Monday as well throwing parcels, I was worried he might have mine and break it so I took the video.

'Then I looked out the window yesterday and saw the same courier.'

MailOnline has contacted Yodel for comment.
