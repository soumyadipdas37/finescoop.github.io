PSG star Neymar has expressed his joy after returning to training following his positive coronavirus test last week. 

The 28-year-old contracted COVID-19 after an end-of-season holiday in Ibiza, following the Champions League final defeat to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. 

Team-mates Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes also tested positive but following seven days in isolation, Neymar has returned to training and tweeted his excitement at being back with his club.

The PSG star said: 'I went back to training, super happy... #CORONAOUT'. 

On September 3, a club statement read: 'Three PSG players are confirmed positive after a Sars CoV2 test and have undergone the appropriate health protocols,' the club said on social media. 

'All players and staff will continue to be tested over the next few days.'

Yet he has since recovered and Neymar recently put any suggestion that he could leave PSG after their European heartbreak to bed a few weeks ago. 

He told the club's official magazine he would like to go one better in this season's Champions League and become a legend in the French capital.

'I'm staying at PSG next season! And with the ambition to return to the Champions League final, this time to win it,' he said.

'I like the idea of doing everything to leave my name in the history books of my club.' 

The Ligue 1 champions certainly missed their main man on Thursday, as they slumped to a shock 1-0 defeat against Lens in their season-opener.
