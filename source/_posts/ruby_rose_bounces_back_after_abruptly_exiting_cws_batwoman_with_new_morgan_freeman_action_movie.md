She shocked fans earlier this year when she announced she was leaving The CW network's Batwoman after just one season.

But it appears that Ruby Rose has certainly landed on her feet scoring a leading role alongside American actor Morgan Freeman. 

According to Deadline the 34-year-old will star in George Gallo's upcoming action-thriller file Vanquish, which is currently filming in Mississippi.

The film will see Morgan portray a retired police commissioner, who kidnaps his caretaker's daughter and blackmails her into helping him double cross his team of dirty detectives. 

'This is going to be a real fun ride and with performances by Morgan Freeman and Ruby Rose, the film is elevated to a higher level,' director George told the publication. 

Also joining the cast are fellow actors; Nick Vallelonga, Miles Doleac, Patrick Muldoon, Juju Journey Brener and Julie Lott.

Ruby's new role comes after it was announced that she was stepping away from Batwoman in May.

Last month the Australian actress explained she had obtained several injuries and decided to leave after having time to reflect on her life and career during the COVID-19 pandemic.

'Being the lead of a superhero show is tough. Being the lead in anything is tough,' Ruby told the publication.

The Orange Is The New Black favourite was still recovering from surgery and said it was 'taxing' for the starlet to work. 

She said she thought it was 'time to take a break to fully heal and then return', but the COVID-19 pandemic changed her mind. 

When filming for the 'real finale' of the show was haltered due to the crisis, it gave the actress to reflect on her career.

'You know, you have time in quarantine and sort of isolation to just think about a lot of different things and what you want to achieve in life and what you want to do,' she explained to the publication.
