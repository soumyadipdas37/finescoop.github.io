Malcolm in the Middle is about to be become a dad himself.

Frankie Muniz and his newlywed wife Paige Price Muniz took to YouTube on Saturday with a joyous announcement – the happy couple is '15 weeks along, and counting' as they expect their first child in March of next year.

The actor, 34, and his 27-year-old bride begin the video with some awkward dance moves that are peppered throughout the clip, before Frankie is heard in voice over. 

Big news: Frankie Muniz and his newlywed wife Paige Price Muniz took to YouTube on Saturday with a joyous announcement – the happy couple is '15 weeks along, and counting' as they expect their first child

Muniz, who is also a former race car driver, starts off by describing the adventures he and Paige have experienced over the past four and a half years, as they traveled the world.  

'But nothing quite compares to  the first time hearing your little one’s heart beat,' the Stay Alive actor said.

Frankie went on to say it was something of a 'miracle,' and that 'when reality set in,' he began 'throwing out baby names and future career choices.'

Paige, for her part, talked about how the parents-to-be were in 'a state of disbelief' upon learning the news of the pregnancy, going on to touch upon some health concerns.

'We knew that we wanted this,' she said in the video, 'but we were told that our chances weren’t that great.

'The struggle of going to every doctor's appointment made me feel less and less like a woman,' she continued.

While it wasn't clear what the reason was for their perceived difficulties conceiving, the problem presumably could stem from Frankie's health problems as a result of multiple race car driving accidents. 

Regardless, Paige went on: 'I'm excited to say that we beat the odds and we’re officially 15 weeks along and counting!'

The video continued to show the loving pair embracing and rejoicing, and holding up a picture of the first sonogram.

Frankie also at one point puffed his own belly out and mimed being pregnant himself, using his TV-seasoned comedic chops.

The description of the video revealed that the Munizes are 'currently traveling through Jackson, Wyoming and we decided to make a little video!'

'We were shocked and thrilled to hear the news that we're going to be parents,' the statement also read.

Frankie and Paige wed earlier this year, tying the knot in a small ceremony in late February in Phoenix, Arizona.
