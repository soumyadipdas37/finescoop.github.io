Directed by Justin's Never Let You Go, U Smile, Next to You and No Brainer collaborator Colin Tilley, the moving video comes in at five and a half minutes long. 

The video opens with Justin and Ryan waking up together in bed, sharing sweet moments over coffee before he heads off to work in an oil field and she goes to work to care for an elderly patient. 

'That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me,' Justin sings in the chorus of the song as montages of the couple together flash on screen. 'Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.'

Justin then gets to work in a grey long sleeve T-shirt, brown overalls and a yellow safety hat, covered in oil residue.

Prior to his fifth studio album, he last released Purpose in 2015 and toured from 2016 until 2017 before ending tour early to focus on his mental health.  

After a very long break from music, he returned to the stage for surprise performance at Coachella during Ariana Grande's headlining set in April 2019.
