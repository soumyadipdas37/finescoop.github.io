Even Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is not above COVID-19 rules as he was pulled over by police on his way to work today.

Mr Andrews was responding to allegations of police officers covering their name tags during anti-lockdown protests when he revealed he was stopped by cops in Melbourne on Saturday.  

'My vehicle was stopped on the way to the office this morning and the officer was clearly identifiable,' he told reporters. 

'And I thanked him for the work that he and his colleagues were doing.'

The Victorian Premier said he 'certainly hadn't heard or seen reports' of police officers covering their name tags and badges.  

Police have checkpoints around Melbourne to ensure that people are not travelling outside of a 5km radius of their homes, which is a Stage Four lockdown restriction. 

People are allowed to travel outside of their radius for permitted work, which was the case with Mr Andrews. 

More than 1,000 anti-lockdown protesters descended on Melbourne and clashed with police for a 'Freedom Day' rally on Saturday, which resulted in 15 arrests. 

Police officers were out in force in Melbourne on Saturday to combat anti-lockdown protests. The Victorian Premier said he 'certainly hadn't heard or seen reports' of police officers covering their name tags and badges 

One protester was arrested for assaulting a police officer, 14 were arrested for breaching COVID-19 restrictions and another 150 were fined on the spot.    

Mr Andrews said there was a 'very visible, very significant police presence in the city' in response to the protests. 

'Some people have forecast that they intend to - in a selfish, dangerous and unlawful way - protest and put this strategy at risk. Police, I think, are taking very appropriate steps to deal with that,' he said. 

The protests kicked off at the Shrine of Remembrance but coronavirus-deniers have later took to the streets, stopping traffic near Albert Park.

Shocking footage shows the horde of protesters, many refusing to wear masks and battling with police, as the city's CBD was brought to a standstill as traffic was diverted from the area. 

Dramatic scenes saw demonstrators tackled to the ground while officers struggled to detain them.   

One crowd faced off with police on horseback as the chant 'freedom' rang out across the city. 

Victoria recorded 76 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths on Saturday, with the welcome infection numbers coming after a spike earlier in the week saw 113 new cases after days of double digit transmission.

Friday was Victoria's deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 59 deaths announced - but 50 of those had occurred back in July and August in aged care homes.
