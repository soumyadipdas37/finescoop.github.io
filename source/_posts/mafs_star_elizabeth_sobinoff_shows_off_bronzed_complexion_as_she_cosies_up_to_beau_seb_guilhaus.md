She is very much smitten with her boyfriend, Seb Guilhaus.

And as well as proudly flaunting her romance in a smitten new snap on Tuesday, Elizabeth Sobinoff also showed off her incredibly deep tan.

The Married At First Sight star wore a glittering bustier top which highlighted her bronzed complexion as she cosied up to her other half.

Elizabeth looked sensational in her tight strapless number, which bared her tanned décolletage.

The reality star had locks brushed away from her face, and she emphasised her features with a glamorous coat of make-up and drop silver earrings.

Placing her hand on Seb's stomach and smiling for the camera, the beauty couldn't have looked happier.

She added the caption: '@Seb.guilhaus just want to say I'm proud of you and @glamourmakeupmirrors that light is bright!!!!!!! Poor Seb didn't know what hit him! Keep knocking your goals and growing beautiful boy.'

Elizabeth's smitten display comes after she added to her ever-growing tattoo collection on Saturday.  

Sharing a photo at a Sydney tattoo parlour, the TV personality revealed she has added a large design to her inked physique.

The brunette stunner proudly showed off her new tattoo, which was placed on her left thigh.

The design, which was placed alongside two previously-inked wolves, included a forest, mountain and moon inside a circle.

'Inked up again! Thank you Gillian for my new contribution to my collage. If you didn't know me you'd think I was cleaned skin,' she wrote.

Her beau Seb commented underneath her post, writing: 'Insert wolf howl.'

This comes months after Elizabeth revealed a huge new inking underneath her bust, as well as one on her back. 

Pulling up her black top, the brunette proudly showed off a bee and flower design across her torso, followed by a kookaburra on one side of her back.

In June 2019, she also got a comprehensive new inking, spanning from her back, down the side of her body, and to her thigh.

The sprawling design incorporating various animals was inspired by the children's book Possum Magic, by author Mem Fox, and the TV show The Animals of Farthing Wood.   

Since meeting on Married At First Sight last year, Elizabeth and her boyfriend Seb recently relocated to Sydney where they are living as a couple.
