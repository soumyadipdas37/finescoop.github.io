A model has slammed a creepy bar worker for sending her inappropriate texts after taking her number from the Track and Trace app when she ordered drinks. 

Dancer, fire performer and personal trainer Lucy Dixon, 32, accused the worker of breaking the law after he sent her a selfie and said: 'I was working the night you came in, you're gorgeous'.

Miss Dixon, who lives in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, posted grabs of their messages to Facebook.

Under Government measures pubs and bars have to ask customers to leave their contact details so they can be called and asked to self-isolate in the event of a coronavirus outbreak.

Alongside the screengrabs Miss Dixon wrote: 'Track and Trace, and bars having to take down your details in order for you to be there these days.

'And this is exactly what should never happen. A complete breach of GDPR. 

'Currently getting to the bottom of how and why this has happened. Surely these are meant to be secure databases no?' 

In the string of messages the bar worker, who said his name was Tom, wrote: 'Hey gorgeous, hope you're well? Xx Was fun seeing you at the*'. Miss Dixon hid the name of the bar where she had enjoyed a night out. 

Miss Dixon replied 'who is this', to which he said: 'Tom.' She responded: 'I actually don't know who you are.'

Miss Dixon (pictured) told Tom her number wasn't on Instagram before she guessed he had taken it from the Track and Trace app 

The guy then sent her a selfie and added: 'I was working the night you came in, you're gorgeous x'

Horrified Miss Dixon added: 'How did you get my number?' He replied: 'Off Insta. Hope that's ok?'

But she hit back and said: 'My number isn't on Insta.' A rumbled Tom then said: 'Sorry if not. If you want me to leave it's fine.'

But he persisted and added: 'Where abouts you from?'

After working it out, Miss Dixon added: 'Have you taken my number from when I ordered drinks through the app last night?'

It is unclear exactly where Miss Dixon was drinking.

Tom replied: 'Maybe. But if you want me to leave it is fine. And sorry if so. I'm guessing so.'

She responded: 'You know that's against the law?'

He sheepishly added: 'As I said I'm sorry so I'll leave it.'

Shocked social media users quickly took to the comments to vent their frustration that the system could be so easily abused. 

Emma Louise said: 'I'd be straight telling the bar that you went to. What the hell. He's even sent a photo, how incriminating.'

Siobhan McManmon-Greenlees said: 'A database is only as secure as those administering it are. In this case, not at all.'

Dawn Holdbrook added: 'I hope you reported him for that, it's utterly disgusting.'

And Alana Marshall said: 'Wow this is horrendous!!!'

In July it was revealed little over 81 per cent of infected people were actually tracked down by tracers — marking the first time the system has caught more than 80 per cent of patients since it launched on May 28.

One in four people who came into close contact with someone infected with coronavirus could not be reached by the NHS Test and Trace service.

Only 75.1 per cent (13,974) of contacts were reached and asked to self-isolate. This was down from the 78.4 per cent reached in the previous week, and the 90.8 per cent reached in the first week of Test and Trace.

Scientists have previously said eight in 10 Covid-19 sufferers need to be reached and their contacts isolated for the system to be effective.
