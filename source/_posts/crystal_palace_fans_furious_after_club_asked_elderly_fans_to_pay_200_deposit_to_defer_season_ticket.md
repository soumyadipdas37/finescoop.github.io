Crystal Palace supporters have been angered after the club asked elderly fans concerned about coronavirus to pay a £200 deposit to defer their season ticket until next year.

The 'save your seat' policy allows vulnerable fans to wait until the 2021-22 campaign before returning to Selhurst Park if they are worried about catching the disease, but it has dismayed many of the club's faithful.

Premier League clubs are facing huge pressure to welcome back spectators to their stadiums after missing out on months of revenue from their fan base, and some have begun making preparations for their season ticket sales to prepare for the return of fans in the next few months. 

Crystal Palace fans have hit out at the club for introducing a controversial season ticket policy

But the future of fans in top flight grounds still has a huge cloud of uncertainty hanging over it after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced there would be a 'review' on plans to reintroduce crowds following a surge of COVID-19 cases.

However, Palace, headed by chairman Steve Parish, are still pressing ahead with their plans. Fans have until September 17 to secure their seat, with prices ranging from £420 to £720 for adults. 

But for those who are clinically vulnerable and feel the need to shield themselves, the club have given them a chance to keep their season ticket until next season - given they pay the deposit.

Some Palace fans have called the policy 'a kick in the teeth', and they have been further infuriated after the club confirmed those supporters will have to provide medical evidence that they are at risk. 

Palace, headed by chairman Steve Parish, will charge a £200 deposit to elderly fans concerned about COVID-19 to defer their seat until next season 

Robert Sutherland, editor of Palace's FYP Fanzine, told the Athletic: 'We are being given the unenviable choice of providing proof that we are shielding to be eligible for the £200 deposit, or finding £500 to pay for a season ticket on the provision that we might be able to attend games in the future.

'This has left a lot of fans — like me — with the feeling of having my loyalty questioned.'

The policy could even be illegal, according to Andrew Leakey, national head of litigation at Metamorph Law. 

'The approach of making people pay who could be shielding could be disability discrimination contrary to the Equality Act 2010.' he said in the Athletic. 









'The act requires that a reasonable adjustment is made for people with disabilities and that they are not charged for this. Making someone pay a deposit could breach the act.'

Fans expressed their fury on social media, with one supporter urging the club to 'do the right thing' on season tickets and help their loyal fans through a struggling time. 

'This is a massive opportunity to help the fans in these challenging times,' he wrote. 'They've always been there when the club needed them! We're all in this #COVID19 together. Just do the right thing with season tickets.'

Another said Palace had handled the situation poorly and offered his sympathies to his fellow supporters. 

'Have to say that @CPFC have handled this whole season ticket fiasco very poorly. I have very deep sympathies for those who will struggle to renew all at once and will end up having to pay a lot more by paying via the instalments option. Very poor form indeed.'

Some supporters said they were 'ashamed' of the club while other urged them to support fans

And one said he was 'ashamed' of the club after failing to pass the credit checks to pay for his ticket on a monthly basis. Palace have just signed a deal with a new finance company so interest rates have gone up.  

'Just got declined the finance option for renewing my season ticket,' the supporter said. 'I've had a season ticket for 17 years, I've paid in instalments since it was made available. Can't put into words how ashamed I am of this club right now.' 

Parish also came under fire from a fan whose son has been suffering from cancer and can no longer watch the team play due to 'harsh credit checks'.  

'That's me and my recently recovered from cancer Son unable to watch palace because of harsh credit checks for monthly payments on season tickets. Been ok for the last 11 years. Why the change?'
