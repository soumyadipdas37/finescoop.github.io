Jennifer Garner was California chic when she was glimpsed out and about in Brentwood this Thursday.

The 48-year-old slipped into a stylish fitted sweater with a New Age print that emphasized her trim figure.

Letting her dark hair down, the Juno actress slipped into a pair of skintight jeans that were dotted with fashionable small tears.

Jennifer, who shares three children with her friendly ex-husband Ben Affleck, popped on a Hamptons chic pair of navy and white sneakers.

She accessorized the ensemble with dark cat-eye sunglasses and made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask.

The Miracles From Heaven star is the proud mother of two daughters, Violet, 14, and Seraphina, 11, as well as a son called Samuel, eight.

Jennifer recently posted an Instagram video of herself wearing overall's on her family's farm in Oklahoma, prompting a comment asking if she was pregnant.

'I am 48, have three healthy kids, and am not - and never will be - pregnant. We can put that pupper to rest,' she said lightly.

'Have I gained the Covid 19? Possibly. But that is another story,' Jennifer quipped with a string of emojis including a taco, a slice of pizza and a glass of wine.

Last month an In Touch Weekly source claimed Jennifer and her businessman beau John Miller 'are no longer together' after a less than two-year romance. 

The insider said they 'split up before L.A. went into lockdown,' adding that they 'remain on friendly terms so there’s a possibility that they could rekindle their relationship in the future, but right now it’s over.'

Making it work: Meanwhile Jen and Ben married in 2005, separated in 2015 and finalized their divorce in 2018, retaining a friendly co-parenting relationship since then

DailyMail.com contacted Jennifer's rep for comment on the matter.

John and Jennifer had not been seen together for over a year before this August when it emerged that they have allegedly broken up.

Meanwhile Jen and Ben married in 2005, separated in 2015 and finalized their divorce in 2018, retaining a friendly co-parenting relationship since then.

He has since struck up a relationship with his Deep Water co-star Ana De Armas, who has been introduced to the children.
