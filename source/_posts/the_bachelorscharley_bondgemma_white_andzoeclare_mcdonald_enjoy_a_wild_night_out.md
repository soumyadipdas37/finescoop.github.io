They may have gone on The Bachelor for a man, but Charley Bond, Gemma White and Zoe-Clare McDonald left with a friendship.

Proving there was no animosity between the former love rivals, the three women enjoyed a wild night out on the Gold Coast on Saturday.

With all three now eliminated from this year's season of The Bachelor, they made the most of their newfound single status, heading home with a mystery man at the end of the night.
