She found fame as Kelly on Beverly Hills, 90210.

And on Tuesday, Jennie Garth was spotted out and about in Los Angeles,  barely recognizable thanks to a wide-brimmed hat and face mask. 

The actress, 48, wore a coordinated blue ensemble on the sunny fall day.

Garth paired a sleeveless collared shirt with a sports skirt and designer trainers as she arrived at a golf course.

Her hat was pulled down over her blonde hair that was tied back from her face and she sported black-framed spectacles and a disposable mask.

She was accompanied by her actor husband Dave Abrams, 39.

Garth and Abrams began dating in fall 2014  following the actress' divorce from second husband Peter Facinelli the previous year. 

They became engaged in April 2015 and exchanged vows in July that year.  

However, they separated in 2017 and in April 2018 they filed for divorce. But then in February 2019, they got back together and had the divorce proceedings dismissed.

In an interview with People, Gary had explained: 'Dave and I fell in love really fast and got married within six months,' Garth said. 'We rushed it too much, and that hurt us.'

Garth, who was married to first husband, musician Daniel B. Clark from 1994 to 1996, told the publication that the thought of going through a third divorce 'really devastated me.' 

She told People: 'We definitely had to just part ways completely. And just when I felt whole again, we started hanging out. He needed to go away and figure everything out.' 

She added: 'Marriage is not like a fairy tale. It's a process, and it's about continuously wanting to make it better.'
