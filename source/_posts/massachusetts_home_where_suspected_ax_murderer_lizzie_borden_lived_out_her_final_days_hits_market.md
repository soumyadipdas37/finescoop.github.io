The Massachusetts home where notorious suspected ax murderer Lizzie Borden lived out her final days after being acquitted of bludgeoning her father and stepmother to death in 1892 has hit the market for $890,000.  

The house in Fall River that once belonged to the suspected killer and where she lived up until her death in 1927 was recently listed for sale with Century 21.

Lizzie was sensationally tried and found not guilty of her parents' violent murders but, more than a century on from the grisly crimes, she continues to be the prime and only suspect in the slayings. 

The Massachusetts home where notorious suspected ax murderer Lizzie Borden lived out her final days after being acquitted of bludgeoning her father and stepmother to death in 1892 has hit the market for $890,000. The home pictured 

The house in Fall River that once belonged to the suspected killer and where she lived up until her death in 1927 was recently listed for sale with Century 21. It has been restored in its Victorian-era style 

Named Maplecroft, the 4,000-square-foot home has been restored in the high style of its Victorian past but with the benefits of 'today's modern conveniences', according to the listing.

The sprawling mansion boasts seven bedrooms, 3.5 baths and six fireplaces and is nestled in just under half an acre of land.

It also features tin ceilings in the kitchen, coffered ceilings, walnut wainscoting, inlaid parquet floors and stained glass in a hark back to its Victorian heyday. 

The new home can be snapped up fully furnished with period pieces including exquisite mantle pieces that the listing describes as 'holding a hidden meaning'. 

Built in 1887 at what is now 306 French Street in the historic Highlands District, it could be the perfect home for a true crime fan looking to snap up a piece of American history.

However, the new owners can sleep easy without worrying about the ghosts of Lizzie's parents making an appearance because it is not the house where the infamous murders took place.

That property, also in Fall River and located on 230 Second Street, has been a bed and breakfast since 1996.

Maplecroft is still considered a historical landmark as the place Lizzie lived out her dying days.

Its current owners, who bagged the property in February 2018 for $600,000, had planned to turn the house into a bed and breakfast. 

Lizzie is suspected of murdering her father Andrew and stepmother Abby back in 1982.

The two very wealthy victims were found hacked to death in the Fall River home they shared with his adult daughters Lizzie and her sister Emma on the morning of August 4.

Andrew's body was found on the living room couch, where he had been sleeping.

His face almost split in two from the violent ax attack. 

Abby, who both Lizzie and Emma disliked, was found upstairs in a pool of blood.  

The Borden sisters, whose mother died when they were younger, called Abby 'Mrs. Borden' and were fearful that she and her family wanted to get their hands on Andrew's money.

With both Andrew and Abby out the picture, Lizzie and Emma would inherit their father's fortune.

Lizzie allegedly discovered her father's body that morning and called for the housekeeper Bridget. 

The net closed in on Lizzie when she was found to have burned a dress similar to the one she wore on the day of the murders in the week after her parents' killings.

She claimed the dress had been covered in paint but prosecutors said she was burning the blood-stained dress to cover-up the murders. 

Prosecutors also said she had bought a small ax the day before.  

She was also the first person on the scene of the murders and the only person, other than the housekeeper, in the home at the time. 

Emma was out of town when the murders took place.

Lizzie was arrested and put to trial for double murder.  

The widely publicized trial began in New Bedford in June 1893 and she was acquitted of the murders on June 20 after the jury deliberated for just 90 minutes.

The jury was thought to have been swayed by the fact she was an active member of the local church while the police had refused to carry out fingerprint testing on the murder weapon found in the basement saying the technique was unreliable.  

No one else was ever suspected or taken into custody and the case went cold.

Lizzie and Emma inherited their father's money and lived the high life in Fall River, buying the property now known as Maplecroft where they lived together for many years.  

However, despite her acquittal, the community continued to suspect Lizzie of the grisly murders and she was accused of shoplifting four years later. 

Her sister Emma moved out of the home in 1905 after the two once-close sisters fell out for unknown reasons and never spoke again.  

Lizzie died from pneumonia in 1927 and was buried in the family plot next to her parents.
