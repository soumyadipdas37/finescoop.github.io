Sam Frost is used to delivering lines on the soap opera Home and Away.

But on Friday, she revealed the 'very confronting' mishap that happened while stripping down onstage for Channel Seven's charity show The All New Monty: Guys and Gals.

The 31-year-old actress told Nova's Fitzy and Wippa: 'I was absolutely terrified, I was shaking, I was very anxious.'

Oh dear! Home and Away's Sam Frost (pictured) revealed the 'very confronting' onstage mishap as she stripped in front of her co-stars for The All New Monty: Guys and Gals

'I had all my colleagues in the audience and my bosses! It was very confronting!'

The blonde beauty added that she and her co-performers - including the likes of Danielle Spencer and Fiona O'Loughlin - did not have a proper run through of their routine before the show.  

'They're like, 'oh don't worry, no one is going to see there's going to be smoke blah, blah, blah.''

She explained that they were told that a smoke machine would provide them with enough cover while on stage - but was rather surprised when that was not the case.

'Then we got there and there wasn't that much smoke and I was like, 'oh this is weird!''

Sam will also perform in the burlesque show alongside beauty queen Erin Holland, entertainer Patti Newton and former Olympian Leisel Jones.

Uh oh: The blonde beauty added that she and her co-performers were told that a smoke machine would provide them with enough cover while on stage. Sam said, 'Then we got there and there wasn't that much smoke and I was like, 'oh this is weird!''

The ladies will be joined on stage by male celebrities, including actor Samuel Johnson, former Home and Away star Orpheus Pledger and comedian Paul Fenech.

The All New Monty: Guys and Gals will see 15 celebrities in total bare all to raise awareness of early detection and prevention of cancer.
