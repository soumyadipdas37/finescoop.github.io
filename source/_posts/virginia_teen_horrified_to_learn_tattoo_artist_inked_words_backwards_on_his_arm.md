A Virginia teenager may want to reflect on his life choices after spending two hours in a tattoo parlor getting a message inked on his arm — only to discover later that the artist wrote the words backwards.

Dylan Harraway, 18, wanted the words 'Dream Chaser' on his arm in an homage to rapper Meek Mill.

But according to Jam Press, the artist messed up — big time — and tattooed the design's mirror image, so Dylan can only read it if he looks at it in the mirror.

Yikes... The artist messed up — big time — and tattooed the design's mirror image, so Dylan can only read it if he looks at it in the mirror

Cheap: He shelled out $200 at a 'very professional and clean' tattoo parlor and sat for two hours while his arm got inked

Dylan, an aspiring rapper, was inspired by Dream Chasers Records, founded by 33-year-old rapper Meek Mill.

He also liked the message behind it, explaining: 'I need to do whatever I need to do to chase my dreams of living the life I’ve wanted.'

So he shelled out $200 at a 'very professional and clean' tattoo parlor and sat for two hours while his arm got inked.

Dylan himself didn't realize that anything was wrong until a friend pointed it out.

'I didn’t notice until my friend told me it was backward,' he said 'I was very angry and there were a lot of emotions running through me.'

'I didn’t notice until my friend told me it was backward,' he said. 'I was very angry and there were a lot of emotions running through me.'

Though clearly not thrilled, he had enough humor about it to share a video about the snafu on social media.

'So you think y'all having a bad day?' he says in the clip, filming himself in the mirror. 

'I just went and got this tattoo for $200, and went to realize the dude put it on f***in' backwards, so now I can only read it through a mirror and people can't see it.' 



Oh well... Commenters have told him it's his own fault for skimping on a tattoo that should have cost more than $200

Lucky: But there may be some home for Dylan yet, as celebrity tattoo artist Bang Bang came across his story and has offered to fix it for him

Commenters have told him it's his own fault for skimping on a tattoo that should have cost more than $200. 

'My friend just thought it was funny and it looked good and my family thought I was a dumbass!' he added. 

But there may be some home for Dylan yet: Celebrity tattoo artist Bang Bang came across his story and has offered to fix it for him.

And Dylan isn't scared off of ink, either. He said he eventually wants to finish the full sleeve.
