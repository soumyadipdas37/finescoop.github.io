The end of the Premiership campaign is approaching but with just three games to play it is still uncertain who will be joining dominant Exeter in the play-offs.

Sale, Bristol and Wasps all hold the keys to the final-four but are being hunted down by Bath with the games running out.

Sportsmail's Will Kelleher preview's Saturday's action in the Premiership. 

(Ricoh Arena, 12.30pm, BT Sport Extra 1)

Wasps go strong, knowing a win would push them above Bristol, who rest their stars for the Challenge Cup quarter-final next Friday and hand a debut to wing Niyi Adeolokun.

PREDICTION: Home win.

Wasps will hope to take advantage of a weakened Bristol team to boost their play-off hopes

(Welford Road, 2pm, BT Sport 1)

Dan Biggar starts for Northampton but George Ford is rested for Leicester, who have shipped an average of 35 points per match since the resumption.

PREDICTION: Away win.

(The Stoop, 3pm, BT Sport Extra 2)

Duncan Weir starts at fly-half for Worcester and Ted Hill captains. Irish play Agustin Creevy, Nick Phipps and Paddy Jackson. Matt Rogerson captains the Exiles from blindside flanker.

PREDICTION: Home win.

Bath are still hoping to get over the line and secure a play-off spot with three games to play

(AJ Bell Stadium, 3pm, BT Sport Extra 1)

Bath benched Sam Underhill and Jonathan Joseph in midweek, so they should start with Anthony Watson. Manu Tuilagi is set to return for Sale with Faf de Klerk at scrum-half .

PREDICTION: Home win.

(Allianz Arena, 4.30pm, BT Sport 1)

Exeter are already in the play-offs and skippered by Don Armand as England hopeful Josh Hodge plays on the wing. Sarries are led by Calum Clark and have Manu Vunipola at fly-half.

PREDICTION: Home win.
