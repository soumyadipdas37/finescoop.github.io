An expectant stylist with an eye for a bargain has turned a discount nightie from Kmart into a chic day dress - and you can do the same for less than $10.

Five months pregnant and largely housebound by Melbourne's second-wave coronavirus restrictions, Shazleen Ali was browsing online shops for comfortable clothes to build trendy outfits around.

Scrolling through Kmart's sleepwear section, the 33-year-old from Melton, 35 kilometres west of the CBD, spotted the $18 'Lounge Nightie', a knee-length dress made from ribbed polyester which comes in two colours: beige and red. 

Using affordable accessories and her flair for fashion, the mum-to-be transformed the beige version into a stylish midi which people claim is 'too pretty to be a nightdress'.

Best of all, the nightie is now reduced to $9 and it's still available online in sizes six through 24.

'Who wouldn't want to wear pyjamas all day,' Ms Ali told Daily Mail Australia.

She said she's been 'really impressed' with Kmart's recent clothing collections and feels the retailer has drastically improved its offering in the casual wear department.

It was pieces from this section that she used to style the nightie, slipping a $30 denim jacket over her shoulders and $17 tennis shoes - which she calls 'super comfy' - on her feet.

For the finishing touch, Ms Ali accessorised with a $12 fedora hat and $2 earrings and braided her long raven hair into two plaits.

The result is a fashionable ensemble that looks considerably more expensive than its total price tag of just $70.
