Tottenham's Son Heung-Min produced a stunning goal-line clearance to prevent Watford defender Marc Navarro from scoring in their final match of pre-season on Saturday afternoon.

Son appeared to have little chance of stopping Navarro from finding the net after goalkeeper Paolo Gazzaniga went up for a 90th minute corner, but the Korean International raced back before making an excellent challenge.

Son's impressive clearance was not enough to stop Tottenham from losing 2-1 at Vicarage Road but fans were quick to praise the forward's efforts.

Watford defender Navarro picked up the ball just over the halfway line and laced one towards the empty goal. 

Son - who was wearing the captain's armband for the first time due to players missing on international duty - raced back from inside Watford's half to clear the ball off the line. 

Supporters took to Twitter to laud Son for covering over half a pitch to prevent Watford from scoring another goal in a 'pointless friendly'. 

One fan wrote: 'That goal line clearance by Son was incredible. Last second in a pointless friendly he sprinted back to do it I respect it' 

While another added: 'Son deserves man of the match for that clearance.'

Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho was also impressed with Son's effort, telling the official Spurs website: 'I would say that those are the positives, players who needed minutes had them, some players played 90 minutes.

I really liked the fact that in the last minute, we are fighting to try to score, and then Sonny makes a 100-metre sprint to stop the 3-1 on the counter-attack.'

With the Premier League starting next weekend, Tottenham will take on Everton at home on Sunday.
