An Indiana wife allegedly used deadly mushrooms to poison her husband after researching toxic fungi online.  

David Fouts, 50, was found dead in a ditch close to their home in Hamilton County in April and had consumed poisonous mushrooms at the time of his death, an autopsy has revealed.  

Wife Katrina Fouts, 54, of Pendleton, and her alleged accomplice Terry Hopkins, 64, of Williamsburg, have been arrested and charged in connection with the incident.

Fouts' body was discovered on April 24 in a ditch near the 21500 block of Overdorf Road in rural Noblesville, several days after he was last seen. 

He was found with lethal amounts of toxic mushroom chunks in his system as well as cuts on his hands, and duct tape residue on his wrists and ankles. 

According to a court affidavit, the mushroom he had ingested was identified as the potentially lethal Lyophyllum connatum, or white domecap mushroom.

It is unclear if David had been forced to eat the fungus, or if it had been given to him as part of a meal. 

'Lyophyllum connatum is poisonous due to muscarine, a well-known mushroom toxin,' the affidavit states.

Katrina Fouts did not report her husband missing or try to call him in the days after he had disappeared, according to investigators. 

When Hamilton County deputies went to the Fouts home early on August 25,  to inform Katrina Fouts about the discovery of her husband's body, she claimed that he had threatened suicide multiple times over the years. 

'Katrina Fouts stated that the previous weekend, David Fouts had been saying everyone would be better without him,' the affidavit states. 

Lyophyllum connatum, also known as White Domcap mushrooms, are commonly found growing in clusters in woodland.

Ingestion symptoms include sweating and producing excess saliva and tears. 

Depending on the toxicity of the mushroom and the dosage, effects can be potentially lethal to humans without medical intervention. 

'Katrina Fouts said repeatedly that she felt guilty for not having done enough to help him.' 

A probe by the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office led to the discovery of a screenshot on her phone showing she had researched deadly mushrooms. 

Investigators say the screenshot contained information on a similar poisonous mushroom known as Amanita virosa, which was described as 'among the deadliest plants known to mankind.' 

Investigators became suspicious when they discovered evidence that David Fouts' body had been dumped in the ditch after he had died. 

'Specifically, the lividity marks on the decedent did not match the location and position in which the body was discovered,' one investigator said. 

Fouts reportedly also offered conflicting information about the location of her husband's phone, which was found inside their house.  

Fouts and her alleged accomplice were arrested earlier this week. Terry Hopkins was accused of aiding and abetting Fouts after traces of his DNA were found on the victim's shirt, according to a report by Fox59. 

Investigators have not yet shared a possible motive for the killing. 

Fouts and Hopkins remain in prison ahead of their next court appearance.
