A 'silent wave' of neurological illnesses could sweep Australia in years to come as brain damage caused by coronavirus may lead to other diseases, scientists say. 

New research into the long-term effects of COVID-19 published on Wednesday has found survivors may have an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease.

The virus creates inflammation on the brain which can act as a trigger for the onset of more serious conditions.   

'Parkinson's disease is a complex illness, but one of the causes is inflammation, and the virus helps to drive that inflammation,' Kevin Barnham from the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health told the ABC.

'Once the inflammation gets into the brain, it starts a cascade of events which can ultimately lead to Parkinson's disease.' 

The ramifications described were witnessed after the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, with Parkinson's disease cases tripling five years after the outbreak. 

The study, published in the Journal of Parkinson's Disease, proposes a 'two-hit' hypothesis, in which an initial inflammation event occurs, such as the virus, with a second then fuelling the later development of the nervous system disorder. 

Not every survivor will develop the disease, but it is still to early to know what percentage will, experts say.  

However, Professor Barnham said with 30 million people worldwide being diagnosed with the virus, even a small percentage would create a surge in Parkinson Disease cases.

While further research is needed to determine the relationship between COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease, researchers are investigating intervention methods.  

Warning signs, such as loss of smell, can occur up to a decade before Parkinson's disease sufferers experience physical symptoms. 

If diagnosed early, therapeutics can be applied to prevent brain cells from dying off. 

Researchers from the Florey Institute are working on a screening test to identify indications of the disease, like ability to smell and brain functioning.

It will be available to those 50 and over.  

If effective, it could have far reaching benefits- with Parkinson's disease cases set to double to 12 million the next 20 years - even before the coronavirus pandemic.   

'Add to that the silent wave from COVID, and those numbers will explode and there will be serious societal and economic consequences from that,' Professor Barham said.

Parkinson's disease is a degenrative neurological condition that affects the control of body movements.

It causes trembling in the hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face, stiffness in the lower body, slowness of movements, unstable posture and difficulty in walking. 

A screening tool for those 50 and over is being designed to measure smelling-capability to detect Parkinson's disease early (stock of a senior wearing a face mask during the coronavirus outbreak)
