Pip Edwards enjoyed some quiet 'me time' without any children around on Sunday night. 

The P.E Nation designer, who is mother to son Justice, 13, shared two Instagram images documenting her relaxing evening. 

The 40-year-old lounged around in luxurious lilac pyjamas with a robe top and flared pants, with a sash at the waist.

She loosely tied it at the top, letting it fall open gently to show off a hint of her tanned skinned. 

The sleepwear set is the Bon Vivant robe and velvet bottom pants in Jacaranda from the brand Sleeping with Jacques, valued at $788 collectively. 

Laying about on a comfortable dark blue arm chair, Pip held a glass of red wine, looking content. 

Her hair appeared wet, as if she was freshly showered, and the blonde seemed to be makeup free.

Pip captioned one of the photos: 'Finally, some kid-free wine time #sundaybest'. 

It's likely Pip was not only referring to her own son, but little Kelsey Lee, who is the four-year-old daughter of her boyfriend, Michael Clarke.  

It's unclear where Pip was spending her quiet evening, but it's likely she was sharing a date night with Michael.

Michael is notoriously private, and while hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip, he did recently say that he couldn't be happier.
