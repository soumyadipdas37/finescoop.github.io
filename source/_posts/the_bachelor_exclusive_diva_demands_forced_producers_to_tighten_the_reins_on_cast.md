There's been plenty of gossiping, fights, scandals and tears on this year's season of The Bachelor to date.

But it appears there was just as much drama behind the scenes between the contestants and producers. 

An on-set source told Daily Mail Australia on Friday that diva demands by some of the female cast forced producers to tighten the reins on publicity opportunities.

According to the insider, the ladies became too picky and self-critical of the professional images used to promote the series' upcoming episodes each week.

Apparently, some of the cast weren't happy with the angle or pose of their glamorous cocktail party photos, and requested 'more flattering' options or for tweaks to be made to the one supplied to them.

'They used to get them sent the day before, but now it's the day of the episode, because too many girls were complaining,' they said.

Spoiler alert? The So Dramatic podcast recently suggested Bella (left) was 'punished' by producers due to a leak of images with blonde intruder Bec Cvilikas (right) on Father's Day

It comes after claims, made in the So Dramatic podcast, suggested Bella was not given her cocktail party photo last week as 'punishment' by producers for potentially leaking spoilers.

Bella was pictured with intruder Bec Cvilikas on Father's Day, which had some fans convinced it was a telling sign the marketing manager doesn't win. 

However, a Network 10 spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia on Monday: 'This claim is completely false. Bella was given all her cocktail party photos.'

The program's head stylist, Kim Hurwitz, shared all the cocktail party looks from Thursday's episode to Instagram, but left out Bella.

When asked by a fan why Bella was missing from the glam lineup, she responded: 'I will repost her pic when she does. I don't have one.'

There are currently eight ladies left in the mansion vying for Locky Gilbert's heart.

Bella is widely believed to be the heartbroken runner-up and Irena is tipped to win, according to betting agencies TAB and Sportsbet. 

The Bachelor continues on Wednesday from 7:30pm on Channel 10
