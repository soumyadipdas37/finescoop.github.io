Sam Allardyce believes West Ham owners David Sullivan and David Gold 'bully' the club's managers into buying players of their choice. 

The Hammers boardroom have felt the wrath of the fans already this summer, with a lack of activity in the transfer market following years of wasteful spending, with Sullivan admitting on Wednesday they had bought 'a pile' of players who have flopped.

Now former West Ham boss Allardyce, who was in charge from 2011-2015 and guided the club to promotion, has described the way in which the owners dictate who comes in - but wasn't full of criticism for the pair. 

Sam Allardyce managed West Ham for four years and guided them to top-flight promotion

But Allardyce says owners David Sullivan and David Fold bully managers into buying players

'[Sullivan's] a strong man when it comes to signing the players he wants, I know that for a fact,' Allardyce told talkSPORT. 

'Sometimes [the owners] will try to bully you into a player they fancy. But you have to stay strong and try to get on with it.

'Sometimes I think his love for football is so great, David Sullivan, he spends the vast majority of his time researching footballers across the world through other sources.

'Sometimes those sources are good, sometimes they're not so good. But at the end of the day it can be a conflict between you and the owner because he wants to make sure when he spends his money he's getting value for money.'

'I think their passion for West Ham, Gold and Sullivan... they get a lot of stick, but they love West Ham.' 

Sullivan has warned that West Ham may end the transfer window without any new additions

So far this summer, West Ham have only managed to tie down Tomas Soucek to a permanent deal following his loan spell. 

The Hammers have so far failed in their pursuit of Burnley centre back James Tarkowski.

Speaking in an interview on talkSPORT that was not well-received by club insiders or supporters, Sullivan said: 'I cannot say for sure we are going to sign anybody. As each day passes, I get more depressed.

'You can't pay double what you value a player at. We haven't got the money. The club will go bankrupt. These are difficult times and we have to be sensible.

Captain Mark Noble led the outrage after the club sold academy product Grady Diangana

'We have a number of bids in for a number of players, but teams don't want to lose them; key players at decent sized clubs, outside the UK. So whether we get any of these players I do not know.' 

Yet the biggest talking point was the decision to sell Grady Diangana to West Brom, which provoked public criticism from club captain Mark Noble. 

The club were in turmoil again on Tuesday night, when manager David Moyes along with first-team players Issa Diop and Josh Cullen tested positive for coronavirus, just minutes before their Carabao Cup win against Hull City.
