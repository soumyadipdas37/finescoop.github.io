Rosie was clearly in the mood to showcase her extensive wardrobe as she rocked seven stylish ensembles on her Instagram stories, before taking to her grid with a further two. 

Among the outfits modelled, Rosie showcased her slender pins in a khaki mini dress, which she paired with gold heels, a tan clutch bag and dark sunglasses.

While she also stunned in a cream wrap dress, accessorising with a tan belt, sand coloured heels and a chic handbag.
