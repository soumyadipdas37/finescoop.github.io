Philippe Coutinho is back training with Barcelona again having returned to the club following his fruitful loan at Bayern Munich. 

Only 21 days ago the Brazilian helped Bayern smash his parent club 8-2 in the Champions League quarter-finals before going on to lift the trophy with his adopted German side.  

But now he's back in Spain with Barcelona and the club posted pictures of the technically gifted midfielder on the training pitch again.

Coutinho scored twice for Bayern Munich against Barcelona in the 8-2 thrashing 

In one photo Coutinho is seen giving a thumbs up to the camera while wearing his protective mask. 

And another shows the 28-year-old running with the ball as his team-mates work in the background.  

Coutinho scored a brace for Bayern in the 8-2 mauling, leading to Quique Setien being sacked by the beaten side.

It was assumed that the former Liverpool man would be moving on to pastures new this summer in what is expected to be a mass clearout at the Nou Camp. 

Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal, Leicester and Newcastle have all been linked with his signature. 

But Ronald Koeman could yet make use of Coutinho and find a place for him in his first team plans with so many senior players seemingly heading for the exit.  

With the Lionel Messi transfer saga engulfing the club, Barcelona are set for a summer of turmoil and where the pieces lay at the end, including Coutinho, still very much remains to be seen.
