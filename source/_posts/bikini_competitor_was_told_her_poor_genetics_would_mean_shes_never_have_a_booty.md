A young woman who was told by a fitness coach that her 'poor genetics' would stop her from having toned glutes has proven him wrong by completely transforming her body.

Debbie Sugrue, 28, first joined a gym in 2011, the same year the Irish-born blonde moved to Australia to settle in Bondi. 

'I was instantly inspired because I noticed such a huge difference in the environment and lifestyle here. It was very appealing to me,' she said.

'I was instantly inspired because I noticed such a huge difference in the environment and lifestyle here. It was very appealing to me,' she said (pictured at the start of her fitness journey left and last year right)

'People looked so energetic, glowing and vibrant everyday! I I wanted this lifestyle too. This was also the rise of Instagram and start of women posting online videos and photos lifting weights in the gym.'

She started out with a simple goal of toning up and getting fitter, making the treadmill her best friend and becoming a 'cardio bunny'.

Debbie soon gained enough confidence to try group classes and was reading about the basics of weightlifting online. While she did enjoy running she was looking to increase her skills in the weights room.

Two years into her fitness journey the classes were no longer 'customised' enough for the energetic gym goer, so she decided to seek out individual help from an expert.

'I was ready to take my fitness goals to another level and was interested in competing professionally in bodybuilding shows. I expressed my new goals to a fitness coach and I openly said I wanted to focus on building my glutes,' she said

'This expert immediately told me that I would never be able to build any glutes because I had poor genetics.

'Obviously none of us like being told we can't achieve something or that we suck before even getting started... however this felt like it was going to be impossible for me specifically, based on this advice.'

While she was initially crushed and led to believe her body was working against her, Debbie knew deep down she hadn't been given a real chance to prove herself.

Breakfast: Protein Oats, six egg whites, 100g blueberries and two Tbsps of almond butter.

Lunch: Lean meat, white rice and greens.

Dinner: Salmon or steak, sweet potato and veggies.

Snacks: Almonds, fruits and protein bars or chocolate mainly. I am so basic but I love the way the food I eat makes me feel.

So she found a new online coach on N8fitness who helps her maintain a healthy diet, document her check ins for competition season and updates her training program regularly

'I also have an in person trainer to train me twice a week and I have changed my mindset and look at food as fuel. I had to get really uncomfortable and eat a lot more to build this much lean mass,' she said.

She trains her glutes on their own three to four times a week and does less cardio overall, although she still walks 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day. 

Some of her favourite moves include hip thrusts, back extensions, pendulum squats and single leg presses but she acknowledges that individuals should work within their limits. 

'I really recommend activating before getting into the working sets and warming up correctly,' she said.
