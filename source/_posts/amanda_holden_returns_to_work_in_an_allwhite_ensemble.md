Amanda Holden flashed some serious leg in an all-white ensemble when she headed to work at Heart FM on Tuesday after her summer break. 

The 49-year-old teamed a high-necked form-fitting top which she tucked into a pleated midi skirt, complete with side split from Karen Millen. 

Showing off her summer tan, Amanda gave a very regal wave as she headed back to work, walking tall in which court shoes which had perspex detailing.

Amanda Holden returned to work this morning, and looked stylish as ever in a very Wimbledon whites-esque ensemble.

The Heart FM presenter sashayed through Leicester Square in a white funnel neck top, which she teamed with a pleated skirt, both of which are from Karen Millen. Loving that pop of yellow with Amanda's handbag.

Amanda's skirt is inspired by the iconic kilt, and features pleated details and a buckle waist. It's perfect to team with a silky cami or classic T-shirt, and come winter team with a grey knit and knee high boots.

She added: 'I also turn 50 next year, so I’m expecting a joint birthday! In fact, as a present I think I should be able to press all the golden buzzers!'

Amanda and her co-judges - Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon - returned to screens this weekend for the first time since the pandemic put a stop to production on the current series.

The show resumes over September and October after a lengthy wait, with social distancing now in place and no studio audience.

The Kiss Me Kate actress said: 'Being a meter apart will be annoying because we’re a very emotive judging panel and we hug one another if an act has been particularly emotional and set one of us off crying.

'It’s going to feel very odd explaining to all our kids that they can’t come and hang out backstage.'

The semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October.

As usual, Ant and Dec will host, and Ashley Banjo will replace Simon at the judges’ desk, after the head judge broke his back in LA three weeks ago during a bike accident.
