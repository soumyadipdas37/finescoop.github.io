A mother has transformed an empty wardrobe into a stylish home office in a DIY project so clever, people have likened it to a professional job.

Determined to create a tranquil space for study, Simona Galea turned an unused closet in the spare room of her central Queensland home into a trendy work station.

With help from her husband, the mum-of-one covered the back wall with cream panels, pulled out the door frame and slotted a wooden desk - custom made to fit the dimensions - between either side.

She placed a computer on top and arranged books, plants and picture frames on the shelf overhead, which started life as storage space for pillows and bed linen.

'Today we finally got around to building my study nook! We transformed an unused wardrobe into the perfect little space,' she posted on Facebook alongside photos taken before and after the renovation.

The result is a light and airy home office unrecognisable from its original state - not to mention a brilliant use of unused space.

Photos of the 'wardrobe office' have gone viral since they were shared Monday night, racking up 1,000 likes and dozens of comments like 'this is fantastic', 'absolutely love this' and 'what a clever idea'.

'Looks awesome! My daughter said, 'it looks fully sick' - that's the seal of approval,' one mother replied. 

Another said adding panels on the back wall of the wardrobe 'really made a difference' and made the DIY project look more like a professional job. 

But others couldn't believe Ms Galea had a 'spare' wardrobe to transform in the first place.

One woman said: 'Looks amazing - now I just need to find such a thing in my house as an 'unused wardrobe'.'

Another joked: 'Who has unused wardrobes? Don’t you have things to hide?!'

A third joked she struggles to understand the concept of an empty wardrobe because her closets are bursting at the seams with clothes.
