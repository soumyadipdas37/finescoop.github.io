Last week, Bella publicly slammed allegations she was an aspiring actress who once dreamt of moving to LA to further her career.

'I've never moved to LA, I've never wanted or tried to be an actress in Australia, never wanted or tried to get work as an actress in LA and certainly am not acting on the Bachelor,' she wrote on Instagram. 

Without naming names, she claimed that people had tried to 'fabricate' stories about her in order to feel 'relevant' and 'important'.
