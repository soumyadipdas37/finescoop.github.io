This is the comical moment a mother receives the shock of her life when she discovers she is having twin girls during an ultrasound.  

Chancè Hindir-Lane, 25, from Maryland, had been attending a routine ultrasound scan with her husband when she was told by her doctor that she was carrying not one but two babies.

Footage shows the expectant mother refuse to believe what she is hearing and even accuse the doctor of lying before saying: 'No, that's not true.'  

The soon-to-be mother cannot believe what she is hearing when her doctor tells her she is having twins 

Chancè Hindir-Lane, 25, from Maryland, decided to share the comical footage on Instagram

During the clip, which was filmed last year but was shared on Ms Hinder-Lane's Instagram in July, the soon-to-be mother gasps as the doctor tells her: 'You have twins.'

Unable to absorb the bombshell announcement, Ms Hinder-Lane repeatedly replies: 'I'm sorry what?' 

The doctor points out the two babies inside her uterus before the mother says: 'You're lying, you're joking. No that's not true. Aren't babies supposed to be in different things so that's obviously just one.'

The doctor goes on to tell the mother that the growing babies are in two different sacs in her uterus and explains: 'So here is your uterus and then there's a sac that's around this baby and a sac that's around this baby.'

As the information begins to sink in, Ms Hinder-Lane replies: 'So you mean like two of them? Oh my god. So you mean two right? At the same time? How do you even push them out at the same time?'

The doctor explains to the expectant mother that there are two babies growing inside her 

The mother refuses to believe she is having two babies and even asks the doctor if she is lying

The doctor calmly explains: 'Well one baby comes out first and then the next baby comes out.'

Ms Hinder-Lane then goes on to reveal that her sister also has twins as the doctor excitedly shouts: 'Oh my god!' 

The mother, whose twin girls Apphia Chanceline L'âne and Atarah Furaha L'âne are now 20-months-old, said: 'When we showed up to the appointment and they told me I'm having twins, I really thought it was a prank by my husband.

'My husband was just as shocked and extremely excited.

'We couldn't stop thinking about how unreal the whole situation was!'

She added: 'It has been a long ride, but we love being the twins parents!'

In July, the mother decided to share the comical footage with her followers on Instagram next to a message which read: 'Finding out there's two. ''I'm sorry WHAT?''  

Ms Hinder-Lane later took to her Instagram page to share the comical video with her followers

'A year ago today I had a 6-month-old and thought I was pregnant with another baby. I was finally starting to be ok with the idea of having two under two. 

'In my head I was having another boy and I was pretty sure that was that.

'Me finding out I was having twins is still the funniest video I've ever seen. I'm not sure why I thought the doctor was lying to me.'
