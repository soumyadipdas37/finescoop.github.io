Stassie Schroeder was fired from the Bravo reality series Vanderpump Rules in June, after her racially insensitive actions resurfaced over the summer.

The pregnant reality star sat down for her first interview since her firing on Thursday for the Tamron Hall Show, where the host grilled her past behaviors, even calling her ignorant.

Stassi also admitted in the interview that she 'was a Karen' when Tamron brought up the fact that she supported the All Lives Matter movement after slamming the Oscars So White.

Tamron questioned her judgment on making jokes about the black community as well as about Jewish people, after she once called an outfit 'Nazi chic.'

The daytime host candidly said: 'Going back to your history, being in a big city like New Orleans and Los Angeles, I am shocked – and don't take this as an insult – at your level of ignorance as it relates to race and what it means to say Nazi chic to Jewish people and what it could have done to Faith's life."

Schroeder was fired from Vanderpump Rules along with Kristen Doute, when it was revealed that they filed a false police report against former VR co-star Faith Stowers, the only Black woman to appear on the hit reality show.

Schroeder and Doute told police that Stowers fit the description of a Black woman who was robbing men in Los Angeles, and Schroeder and Doute even admitted to calling the cops on Stowers.

Schroeder had started working at Lisa Vanderpump's restaurants Sur and Blanca Villa in 2010, and she has been on Vanderpump Rules since it debuted in 2013.
