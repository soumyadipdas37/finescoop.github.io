Lily James and Andrew Scott featured in first look images for BBC One's The Pursuit Of Love, which were released on Thursday.

The actress, 31, stars as lead Linda Radlett, a charismatic woman in search of a husband in Europe between the two World Wars.

Transforming into her character, Lily put on a stylish display in a dark pink floral shirt and a dark brown pencil skirt that perfectly matched the era.

Lily's brunette locks were styled into marcel waves, and she also used a light palette of make-up to finish off her look.

While it's unclear how Andrew's character may feature in Lily's protagonist's life, she was seen living a life of luxury and partying in her pursuit of love.

One snap from the comedy saw Linda lapping up attention at a raucous party as she danced around in a white slip dress.
