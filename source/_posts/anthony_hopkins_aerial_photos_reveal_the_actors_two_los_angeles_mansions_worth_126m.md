New aerial photos have revealed  Anthony Hopkins' two luxury mansions which sit side-by-side and have a total worth of $12.6m (£9.7m) in the affluent Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles.

The British actor, 83, splashed out on the first home in December 2018 and added the second house, at a price of $6m (£4.6m), to become his own neighbour and create a spacious and private compound in March 2019.

Anthony's first home which is seen in the new aerial shots boasts a more modern design with white roofing and wooden exteriors.

 The snaps also reveal plenty of balcony space to make the most of the sunshine at every level of the house as well as a small paved courtyard at the front and a large pool in the back.  

While the second home sits on the corner of the street and is given some extra privacy by being surrounded by large trees along one side. Pictures also reveal a garage and roof terrace on the property. 

 Sir Anthony, who is thought to have a fortune topping $160 million, is understood to divide his time fairly equally between the compound's two homes, which he shares with wife of 17 years actress Stella Arroyave, 64.

The couple can easily jump between the two mansions through a gate which crosses the driveway between the two properties and makes it simple to pop next door.  

The initial mansion he purchased – for $6m in December 2018 – is a more modern property boasting 5,700-square-feet of living space over three levels plus a rooftop deck with sweeping ocean views.

There are five bedrooms in total, with the main master suite on the third level and a balcony that also looks out onto the Pacific.

On the lower level Sir Anthony and his wife have a gym and yoga studio at their disposal, plus the home originally included a wine cellar – though that's unlikely to have been used, since the actor has been sober for 46 years.

So much space: Both of the homes boast rooftop areas, with the more modern style mansion (left) also having balconies on the front and a pool around the back

Relaxing: One of the homes aslso has a large pool and decking area in the back garden, perfect for relaxing in. The two homes appear to be linked with a gate making it easy for Anthony to visit both

A beautiful outdoor pool is in the garden, where flags can be seen fluttering over the water and a relaxing sun lounger sits nearby perfect for drying off on after a dip in the water. 

In addition, a private seating area can be seen around the back yard, with white sun umbrellas to keep guests cool in the hot weather.

Less is known about Sir Anthony's second property on the compound, which was built in 1940 and upgraded 50 years later.

It sits on the corner of a suburban street, with noticeable features including a rooftop deck, spacious detached garage and a lush front lawn with two giant trees ensuring privacy from passers-by. 

Stunning: As well as the modern wood-fronted home, Anthony also has the white home on the corner of the road which also has its own matching garage at the end of a driveway

Private: Tress surround the back of the two properties and go along the front of the white house with a brown roof

Seating: A spacious decking area is placed next to the pool and appears to lead behind next door's garage

An insider told MailOnline: 'Sir Anthony is an extremely private character, and he loves the tranquility that comes with living in the Palisades.

'He can do his own thing and spread himself between these charming residences, and he's obviously incredibly astute when it comes to real estate.'

As well as his two side-by-side mansions, Sir Anthony also has a smaller property in the area which he purchased in 2016 for $1.1million. He sold his prior main base, a beachfront mansion in Malibu, for $11.5m earlier this year.

That residence made headlines two years ago, when devastating wildfires reportedly threatened to destroy it but the home was remarkably left untouched by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. 

Inside: The first home on the right of this aerial shot, which Anthony purchased in 2018, boasts five bedrooms with the master suite on the third level

Outdoor space: Although not appearing to have a pool, the corner mansion does have lots of grass along the side of the building as well as at the front yard area

Take a dip: Comfortable sun loungers and flags are seen by the pool in the back garden of the modern-style property

Making the most of both: Anthony is thought to split his time equally between the two houses when in LA (pictured the pool)

Zen: The homes boast lots of outdoor space and are not cluttered with chairs or belongings, making them perfect for relaxing

After this, Anthony is thought to have relocated to the Pacific Palisades area to be closer to downtown LA.

Thankfully Sir Anthony will have no such worries at his current abodes, which are noticeably different in style though similar in size. 

Sir Anthony, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his star turn in 1991's Silence of the Lambs, was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 'The Two Popes' this year.

He also starred in TV's Westworld between 2016 and 2018, playing lead character Dr. Robert Ford.

Escaped: The Malibu home (pictured) hit headlines in 2018 after it managed to escape wildfires in the area unscathed despite Anthony's former neighbour's home being destroyed

In a unique joint chat with Brad Pitt published by Interview magazine in 2019, he gave an insight into his down-to-earth personality that's made him so popular among his Hollywood peers.

He said: 'People ask me questions about present situations in life, and I say, 'I don't know, I'm just an actor. I don't have any opinions.

'Actors are pretty stupid. My opinion is not worth anything. There's no controversy for me, so don't engage me in it, because I'm not going to participate.'

Picturesque: The Malibu house also had lots of outdoor space as well as stunning seaviews
