She's been turning heads on the catwalk for over a decade now.

But Cara Delevingne showed her casual side as she headed out for errands in Beverly Hills on Saturday. 

The 28-year-old supermodel displayed her quirky style as she sported a printed T-shirt, an oversized striped red shirt and cycling shorts.

Revealing her impeccable style credentials even on her day off, Cara matched her look with chunky black trainers and vibrant rainbow socks.

The Suicide Squad actress carried her essentials in a green Dior satchel which, along with her gold-rimmed sunglasses, made her look effortlessly cool. 

Cara tied her hair back in a ponytail and donned a white face mask amid the current coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier in September it emerged that the model is currently seeing pop sensation, Halsey, just three months after their exes got together and began dating.

Cara's ex Ashley Benson, 30, began dating American rapper G-Eazy following their split in April.

 G-Eazy, 31, previously dated Halsey, 25, but they separated following speculation that he had cheated on her in 2018, and the pair have continued to throw jabs at each other through their music.

According to The Sun, Cara has been enjoying a new romance with Halsey after separating from her actress girlfriend a few months ago. 

A source close to the British model told the paper: 'Cara has been hooking up with Halsey in the last few weeks and they’ve been having a laugh together.

'They’ve both been very open about their sexuality and just want to enjoy themselves so they’re both on the same wavelength.'

The insider also mentioned that the pair are having fun and are not in an exclusive relationship, so they are free to date other people if they choose.
