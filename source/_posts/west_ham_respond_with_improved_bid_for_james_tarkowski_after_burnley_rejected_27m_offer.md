West Ham have made an improved bid for Burnley defender James Tarkowski.

After their last offer totalling £27m was rejected, the Hammers are understood to have restructured their bid to guarantee more up front with add ons taking it to just under £30m.

David Moyes has made the 27-year old his prime target and has been encouraged by initial talks that Tarkowski is willing to make the move and become the focal point of his defence.

David Moyes is hoping Tarkowski will join and therefore become the focal point of his defence 

West Ham are willing to offer a lucrative package to tempt Tarkowski back to London where he played previously for Brentford.

Moyes has made defence his priority after reluctantly agreeing to the sale of winger Grady Diangana to West Brom.

West Ham are also braced for an offer from Chelsea for Declan Rice but Moyes is determined to keep hold of the England international for at least another season.

The backlash from Diangana’s sale would be pale in comparison if the club sold Rice to their London rivals with Moyes looking to build a side rather than dismantle one.

The Scot wants to change the pattern of signings the club has made in the past as he tries to shape a team to challenge for Europe rather than battle relegation.

He sees Tarkowski as a key first step to that project.   

Earlier on Tuesday, Burnley boss Sean Dyche indicated Tarkowski could be sold if his valuation is met.

'Do players have a price at any club? Yes, we’ve seen that across the whole of football,' Dyche said. 'Eventually a day comes if someone’s going to hit a certain number then all clubs, not just Burnley Football Club, have to make a decision.

'If that comes then the chairman will make that decision. [But] we’re not in the business of getting rid of our best players on the cheap, that’s for sure. In a healthy way, we’ve had speculation on our players since the first year I was here.

'Back in the day, it was Danny Ings then Trips (Kieran Trippier) and more latterly, your Michael Keanes and your Andre Grays. It’s not new to us. The club is in a very, very strong position so there’s no overwhelming desire to be selling players.'

Leicester have also shown interest in Tarkowski in recent years but West Ham are the club pressing ahead to try and complete a deal.
