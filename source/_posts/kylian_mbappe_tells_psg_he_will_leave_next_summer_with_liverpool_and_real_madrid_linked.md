Kylian Mbappe has reportedly told Paris Saint Germain he is to play his final season with the club, before seeking out a move during next summer's transfer window.

Mbappe is contracted to PSG until 2022, meaning next summer is the last opportunity for the Parisians to sell their star asset before the risk of losing him as a free agent.

And now the 21-year-old, who has been linked with both Liverpool and Manchester City, has made clear his intentions to his club, as report the Times.

Kylian Mbappe has reportedly told PSG he will be leaving the club in next summer's window

PSG made a huge investment in Mbappe, signing him from AS Monaco in 2018 for a fee in the region of £165 million. 

The deal remains the second highest ever paid for a footballer, behind PSG's marquee capture of Neymar after triggering his Barcelona release clause.

PSG are said to have made multiple lucrative offers to Mbappe in hope of getting him to commit his future to the club, including making him their highest ever paid player and pledging to build the team around him in future.

But the World Cup winner already has his eyes on pastures now, and it now appears Real Madrid are front-runners for his signature.

Madrid have already drawn up a battle plan for next summer's transfer window, with Mbappe set to be the headline signing in a busy period of elite talent recruitment. 

Mbappe is understood to have been frank with PSG about his wishes to leave, in order to allow technical director Leonardo a final summer window in which to recoup the club’s transfer-fee investment.

PSG will also need to earmark a replacement for the talented youngster, who was a driving force behind their journey to the 2020 Champions League final.
