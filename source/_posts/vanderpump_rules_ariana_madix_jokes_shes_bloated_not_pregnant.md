There were a few struggles with friendships in the last season of Vanderpump Rules. 

And it seems that repairs in relationships have yet to be made as Ariana Madix revealed that she and Tom Sandoval were not invited to recent gender reveal parties hosted by her castmates.

The 35-year-old cocktail queen took to Instagram to poke fun of looming pregnancy discussions with a bare belly shot where she declared she was 'just bloated.'

Ariana rocked red-and-black plaid pajama pants with a black bra for the selfie shared to her one million followers.

'Some of y’all are completely devoid of humor and think everything is 'shade' but I guess I got that attention I was desperate for anyway,' she later wrote. 'BTW it’s a bean and cheese burrito and Del Taco is the father.' 

Her post came shortly after eagle-eyed fans noted the couple weren't in attendance at Lala Kent and Randall Emmett's gender reveal extravaganza in Solvang.

Tom and Ariana were also not spotted in photos when Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright revealed they are expecting a baby boy with a party hosted at their home in North Hollywood, which is just down the street from their own modern farmhouse in the San Fernando Valley.

Ariana and Tom have adamantly denied interest in marriage or having biological children, much to the dismay of their fanbase.

One fan wrote: '@TomSandoval1 & @ariana2525 you peeps are fav!! Just curious why you're MIA in the baby reveal parties?'

Jax and Sandoval's relationship spiraled during the last season of Pump Rules after Taylor felt his best friend wasn't committing enough time or interest to his upcoming wedding to Brittany.

Tom tried to show even more effort than before and still managed to to stand by Jax's side as one of his best men at their wedding last summer in Kentucky.   

Lala Kent recently confirmed the pregnancy pact between a few of her co-stars, including Stassi Schroeder, Katie Maloney and Brittany Cartwright.

While Katie admitted she's still working on her end of the deal, Stassi and Lala are expecting baby girls and Brittany is due to have a boy.

'I'm so happy for my friends and really enjoying being along for their journey. It will happen for us when it's right,' she wrote. 'Sometimes it just takes time and doesn't always happen the first try.'  

Kristen Doute was on hand at Jax and Brittany's big reveal with her new boyfriend, Alex Menache, and seems to be making her way back into good graces with her friends after a difficult falling out on the last season of the popular Bravo program.
