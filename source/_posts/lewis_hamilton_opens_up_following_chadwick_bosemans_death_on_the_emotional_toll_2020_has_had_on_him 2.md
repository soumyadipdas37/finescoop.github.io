Lewis Hamilton revealed the emotional toll 2020 has taken on him so far with the Mercedes driver confessing he is 'feeling a lot of weight' on his heart. 

The death of actor Chadwick Boseman, who was widely known for playing the role of superhero Black Panther, ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix hit Hamilton hard as he 'broke down' before pulling it together to win the race in his honour. 

Hamilton described Boseman as a man who 'moved a generation' and the six-time champion's pain is the latest hurdle he has been forced to overcome in an emotionally exhausting few months.

The six-time champion paid tribute on social media and after victory in Spa he candidly opened up on the emotional toll that 2020 has had on him 

Boseman died aged just 43 after a tragic, and secretive, battle with colon cancer. 

The 35-year-old has been the leading voice in Formula One on the Black Lives Matter movement and he has not shied away from newsworthy topics regarding social justice throughout the year.

But after taking his fifth race win from the opening seven races of the season, Hamilton candidly opened up on the troubles he is facing emotionally in such a turbulent period. 

'When you're watching the news, you see what's happening around the world and I feel really quite affected by it,' he told Sky Sports F1.

Hamilton's consistent push for social justice as well as his efforts on track have taken a toll 

'And then obviously I was so incredibly proud when Chadwick was Black Panther because as I mentioned all the reasons yesterday, as a kid, dreaming of super heroes and finally see someone, a super hero of a similar colour to me, was really just such a remarkable moment, I think, for the black community.

'So when I woke up and I got the news from a friend who has said I'm crying writing this message to you about Chad, and then reading the news I just broke down. I remember, just trying to pull it together and make sure I delivered on that day.'

Hamilton stood atop the podium in Spa and performed the Wakanda salute - made famous by Boseman in Black Panther - to honour the memory of the actor. 

Before the race Hamilton again wore a Black Lives Matter t-shirt as he continues to lead the way for change in the sport. 

Hamilton has used his platforms to condemn racial injustice with incidents such as the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and more recently the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 



Hamilton has criticised the lack of racial diversity in his own sporting discipline on Instagram

Back in June Hamilton gave his full support to protesters in Bristol who pulled down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston, before throwing it into the harbour. 

Writing on Instagram at the time, Hamilton said: 'If those people hadn't taken down that statue honouring a racist slave trader, it would never have been removed. 

'There's talks of it going into a museum. That man's statue should stay in the river just like the 20,000 African souls who died on the journey here and were thrown into the sea, with no burial or memorial.

'He stole them from their families, their country and he must not be celebrated. It should be replaced with a memorial for all those he sold, all those that lost their lives!'
