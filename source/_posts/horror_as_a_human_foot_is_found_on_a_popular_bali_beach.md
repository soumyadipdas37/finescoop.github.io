A tourist was left horrified after discovering half a human foot washed up on a popular Bali beach. 

The discovery was made at Berawa Beach, in the tourist hotspot of Canggu, on Monday. 

North Kuta sub-precinct chief Marzel Doni told Coconuts Bali officers were still investigating where the foot had come from. 

'There’s a possibility that it’s old, and it’s only one part so we can’t be certain yet and we will take it to the hospital,' he said.

'Whether or not it’s actually a human foot. We are going to confirm it first.'

Investigators are yet to link the foot with any missing people.

Police have urged anyone with information that could help to come forward.

One social media page picked up the image of the rotted foot and started to circulate it online. 

Some users speculated the limb could be from a shark attack while others guessed it could have been an amputated foot that somehow got into the ocean. 

The severed body part was still undergoing examination at a Bali hospital as of Wednesday.
