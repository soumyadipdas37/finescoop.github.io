Amazon is a great place to find some fashion dupes for designer items if you're prepared to do a bit of hunting. 

The CRZ YOGA Women's Naked Feeling Gym Leggings caused a storm online when Amazon shoppers compared the workout tights to Lululemon's £80 leggings. 

Now, the brand has once again caught the attention of hundreds of Amazon shoppers thanks to the impressive quality and incredibly flattering fit of their CRZ YOGA Women's Medium Support Strappy Back Yoga Sports Bra.  

The £18 CRZ YOGA Women's Medium Support Strappy Back Yoga Bra is beings snapped up in 12 colours and sizes XS to XL 

The stylish £18 strappy sports bra ticks boxes for affordability, fit and from, with shoppers snapping it up in plenty of colours and prints. 

With over 1,400 ratings on Amazon, the CRZ YOGA Women's Medium Support Strappy Back Yoga Bra is a popular buy with yogi's and gym bunny's looking for a supportive yet stylish sports bra.  

The £18 strappy sports bra is available in 12 colours, including classic black, grey and white, or if you prefer your gym kit to have a dose of colour, there are plenty of prints to help you stand out from the crowd. 

The CRZ YOGA Women's Strappy Back Yoga Bra ticks boxes for comfort as well as style thanks to the wide, extended under-band design. 

The longer style not only looks great but gives you more coverage than regular bras too. If you don't like adding layers to your workout get-up then you could easily just team this with a pair of leggings- no top needed.

'Broader bottom strap makes a huge difference on comfortability. Purchased a second one. Good for yoga (not suited for medium to high intensity training). Straps also looks nice under a casual top. 34C cup size and the large fits well.'

Another agreed, writing: 'Really lovely yoga bra, soft and supportive material. I struggle to find yoga tops to fit as I am a 30G, but this does a fantastic job.'

The bra is made out of smooth, breathable, quick drying fabric to keep you cool and comfortable while you work out 

Support is a word that comes up repeatedly in the Amazon reviews, with shoppers of varying bust size commenting on the fit and shape of the bra.  

'Fits really well, slightly on the small side but that does help with the support - would feel comfortable wearing this for high impact sports. Really pretty and I think it looks a lot more expensive than it was!'.

It's also worth noting that the CRZ YOGA bra has removable padding. While many like the extra support and shape, you can easily take them out as an when you wish. Made out of a Spandex blend, the bra is super flexible, moving with you through your workout.

'This is made from a stretchy performance fabric with a good level of sweat-wicking. The design and coverage are great. Just did a workout and felt comfortable throughout. Good support and the size guide given is accurate.'
