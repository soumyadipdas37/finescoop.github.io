A mother-of-two has told how her creative 12-year-old daughter transformed her poster-filled bedroom into a stylish grown-up space during lockdown - and all for less than £200.  

Stacey Nield, 36, from Accrington, revealed how daughter Evie added stylish touches such as a gallery wall, a bed tray and matching wallpaper, throws and cushions - sourcing items from budget brands including B&M and Home Bargains. 

'My daughter Evie, 12, asked if her bedroom could be decorated after our holiday was cancelled due to Covid-19,' said Stacey, speaking to money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk:

'Evie moved into what was our dining room two years ago so that her then baby brother could have her old room. We chose not to decorate at the time as she was covering the room in posters anyway.

'It was a good focus and something we could do together to keep busy. She has been a great help, stripping wallpaper and painting.

Stacey, an assistant manager in a children's nursery, says her daughter loved shopping for all the finishing touches.  

'We started with the wallpaper,' she explained. 'She wanted pink, grey and rose gold so the paper was a good choice. It cost £13 a roll from Very.

'The Chic Shadow from Dulux matched the wallpaper perfectly and brightened up the room massively. It cost £15 a tin.'

The impressive transformation cost under £200 - thanks to a lot of the accessories from B&M and Home Bargains. Pictured, after the transformation

Aside from the bed, Stacey says the room cost less than £200 to do - thanks to a lot of the accessories from B&M and Home Bargains.

'We bought a £10 throw and a £15 hexagonal mirror from B&M, a £2.99 tray from Home Bargains, and some photo frames ranging from 99p to £2.99 from B&M and Asda,' Stacey explained, 

'The bed was from Bensons but the headboard was only £30 off eBay. The LED lights, which were also Evie's idea, were from eBay. They wouldn't be my first choice when it comes to designing a room but Evie loves them.'

Stacey and Evie are both delighted with how the revamped bedroom has turned out, and found that the project gave them a great distraction during the lockdown.

'It's really given us a great focus during the lockdown, kept us busy and has been a great bonding experience,' Stacey added.

'The only tip I have really is to shop around. Make use of the things you already have. Think about storage too - we got the divan with four drawers to hide as much 'junk' away as we could.'

Tom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals.co.uk, commented: 'Hats off to Evie for taking the initiative to redo her bedroom during the lockdown, at a time which has been stressful for many families.

'By sourcing budget products from B&M and Home Bargains, getting stuck in and doing the wallpaper and painting herself and finding an identical - but much cheaper - headboard from eBay, Evie has really kept costs down and got a stunning grown-up room for under £200.'
