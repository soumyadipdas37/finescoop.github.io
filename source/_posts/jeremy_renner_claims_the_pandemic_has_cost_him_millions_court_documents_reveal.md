Avengers star Jeremy Renner claims the coronavirus pandemic has cost him millions of dollars.

The whopping $344,000 per month he was raking in making movies has dried up, according to court documents filed by the star.

And now he's losing almost $20,000 a month, the Oscar-winning actor insists.

Renner, 49, revealed his plummeting income in the latest legal documents to be filed in the bitter, long-running custody battle he's fighting with his ex-wife Sonni Pacheco over their seven-year-old daughter Ava.

According to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com, Jeremy Renner claims he's losing almost $20,000 a month due to the coronavirus pandemic

Renner has been in a long-running custody battle with his ex-wife Sonni Pacheco over their seven-year-old daughter Ava. The exes are pictured together with their daughter in 2016 

The Bourne Legacy actor has asked Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Anne Richardson to reduce his monthly child support payments to his 29-year-old ex from $30,000 to $11,000.

'It is likely that most productions will not resume again prior to the end of the year,' he said of his stalled film career.

Pacheco asked the court to give her sole custody of Ava, saying Renner is an 'unfit parent'

'As such, the projects that I had previously lined up to film this year are likely cancelled or postponed.'

To back up his claim, Renner has now filed legal papers revealing in detail how his income has been reduced to less than zero this year, thanks to COVID-19.

He listed his average monthly net income during the three years from 2017 to 2019 as $344,649.

But by May this year - in the midst of the pandemic that all-but shut down Hollywood - his net income had dropped to negative $18,368.

His monthly expenses total almost $98,000, according to Renner - who describes himself as an 'actor, singer, songwriter' in his new court filing.

Those expenses include $18,279 a month for the mortgage on his luxury, nine-bedroom mansion in LA's upscale Laurel Canyon area, $5,651 a month for groceries and household supplies, and $3,393 a month for laundry and cleaning.

Plus $11,438 a month to maintain his vacation home in Reno, Nevada.

For all that, Renner's not claiming to be broke. Far from it. He lists almost $19million in assets, including his LA home that's worth around $7million, his Reno house that's worth about $2million, plus more than $1million in stocks and bonds and $135,000 in cash and savings.





In court documents recently filed, Renner listed his average monthly net income during the three years from 2017 to 2019 as $344,649. But by May this year - in the midst of the pandemic that all-but shut down Hollywood - his net income had dropped to negative $18,368

The custody fight between the former couple over daughter Ava has been raging for more than two years and next Thursday, September 17, yet another hearing in the case is scheduled.

Last month Judge Richardson refused to order Renner to take drug tests, called for by Pacheco, after she accused him of getting drunk and high while daughter Ava was with him.

The actor 'has a long history of alcohol and drug abuse which has persisted since before the marriage, through divorce and post-judgment,' blasted Pacheco in legal documents urging the court to force him to be drug tested.

After a closed-door hearing in downtown LA, Judge Richardson denied the Canadian-born actress' request, ruling in a written order, 'Court finds there are insufficient facts to order the drug test.'

But the judge did order Renner to pay $40,000 of Pacheco's legal fees.

Pacheco also asked the court to order Renner to submit to COVID-19 testing after she accused him of putting Ava 'at risk' by partying mask-free with a string of young women.

The former model claimed that her former husband had flown several pretty girls to his mansion in Reno, Nevada where they partied and shared photos of themselves wearing t-shirts emblazoned with 'Camp Renner' – but no masks.

'I am very concerned that Jeremy is not practicing social distancing and is putting Ava (and me by virtue of our joint custody) at risk of being unnecessarily exposed to COVID-19 and request that he submit to testing,' Pacheco said in court documents.

She maintained that the star flew with Ava, 'back and forth to Reno during the stay-at-home orders.'

Renner denied her accusations, telling DailyMail.com that Ava was not in Reno while the young women were there and that the star 'has flown while complying with CDC recommendations', and did so 'just like hundreds of thousands of other people.'

Pacheco previously claimed in documents obtained by DailyMail.com that Renner flew women out amid the pandemic and partied without a mask. One of the women who allegedly visited Renner, Kimia Hangafarin, posted this photo with Renner from the July 4 weekend

Renner and Pacheco broke up in December 2014 after a marriage that lasted just 10 months and in April 2018 they agreed to share custody of Ava with Renner paying his ex $30,000 a month in child support plus up to $200,000 a year into Ava's trust fund.

But their 50/50 custody arrangement quickly degenerated into finger-pointing and bitter court appearances.

Pacheco asked the court to give her sole custody of Ava, saying Renner is an 'unfit parent.'

She claimed that Ava told her that her father Renner bit her, leaving a mark on her shoulder, an allegation the actor denied, saying the mark was from a car seat belt that 'pinched' her.

She also accused Renner of regularly taking drugs while he was supposed to be looking after Ava, firing a gun in the house and threatening to kill himself while Ava slept, and having a 'revolving door' of women partying and staying over while Ava was there.

In addition, she insisted that her ex hubby owed more than half a million dollars in spouse and child support.

Renner fought back, saying Pacheco is 'unstable' and has mounted a campaign of lies to smear him and stop him from seeing his young daughter.

He accused Pacheco of being motivated by revenge after he allegedly declined her overtures for the former couple to get back together. And he claimed she had 'misappropriated' almost $50,000 from daughter Ava's trust fund.

Renner's lawyers accused Pacheco of using his court-ordered payouts to her as a 'slush fund' for a lavish lifestyle and added: 'Sonni's voracious appetite for Jeremy's money has no end in sight.'
