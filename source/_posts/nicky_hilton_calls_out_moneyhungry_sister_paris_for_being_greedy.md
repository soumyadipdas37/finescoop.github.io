Nicky Hilton called out her sister Paris on her new YouTube documentary, This Is Paris, calling her 'greedy' and claiming she is addicted to work. 

The heiress and entrepreneur, 39, has a net worth of $300million dollars but she has said no plans to slow down anytime soon. 

Admitting she hasn't had a holiday since she was aged 15 and that she is away from home travelling 250 days a year, Paris admitted that this can get her down. 

'You're GREEDY!' Nicky Hilton called out her money-hungry sister Paris for being addicted to work... but the heiress said she won't stop until she is a billionaire in new docu This Is Paris 

Burned out: Despite travelling around the world for work, Paris said she hasn't taken a vacation since she was 15 and travels 250 days a year for work 

'You're greedy', Nicky, 36, told her in a matter of fact fashion, advising her to assess her work life balance. 

But Paris said she can't relax until she is a billionaire because that is a personal goal she has set herself. 

However, it seems as though she has taken on Nicky's pearls of wisdom since she filmed the documentary and has since changed her mind. 

Siblings: Nicky gave her sister some home truths in the documentary, telling her that if she wanted a partner and a family, she could just get it 

She said at an AllBright event: 'My goal … was to make a billion dollars, but now, all I really care about is being happy, my love, my relationship, and the future.' 

During their conversation, Nicky asked Paris if she would like to have children. 

At the time of filming, Paris was dating influencer Aleks Novakovic but they have since split and she is now in a relationship with Carter Reum. 

She recently opened up about her plans to start a family, which will include a set of boy/girl twin.

In love: Paris and Carter's romance appears to be going from strength to strength 

Paris said she wants to have a little girl called London and has already frozen her eggs to make sure she can become a parent one day. 

She also recently revealed it was her friend and former assistant Kim Kardashian, 39, who encouraged her to freeze her eggs a few years ago.

The Stars Are Blind artist said: 'I had a really amazing conversation with Kim about it. She introduced me to her doctor, and I was so inspired by her to actually do it.

'I think every woman should do it because you can really control it and not have that, "Oh my God, I need to get married."'
