The sister of a woman shot and killed while getting ready with friends for a night on the town has labelled witnesses 'gutless' and one of them a 'sacred dog' for not revealing exactly how her sibling died.

Ivona Jovanovic, 27, died after being shot in the chest at a her ex-boyfriend's Highland Park home on September 8, 2019.

She was with four friends at the time of the incident, including ex-boyfriend Christos Panagakos who has alleged links to bikies.

The friends allegedly fled the house, despite Ms Jovanovic's injuries, while Mr Panagakos' mother phoned for help.

The investigation is before the coroner, and uncertainty around how Ms Jovanovic came to be shot still persists.

The weapon, believed to be a handgun, is yet to be located and there have been zero arrests since the tragedy.

Annette Jovanovic told Daily Mail Australia one person knows what really happened on that tragic night.

'They're a scared dog' she said.

Police believe witnesses are withholding details of the incident from investigators out of fear of alleged bikie links.

Annette also penned a heartbreaking post detailing her pain and confusion over why witnesses 'can't speak up and give my family any closure'.

She labelled them as 'gutless' and said the incident 'destroyed' her family's life.

'Why every time when I attempt to go to bed my mind begins to race and I'm wide awake still trying to figure out what happened to my sister,' she wrote on Facebook.

'What makes it so much harder is knowing there are four people who know the truth and exactly what happened but yet they can't speak up and give my family any closure.

'Ivona's life was taken and her families lives are being destroyed each day and night.

'Four people who know but are gutless to speak ... I just don't understand.' 

Detective Superintendent Brendan Smith said he was disappointed 'all the people inside at the time haven't given us a full and frank version (of what happened that night)', the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. 

Every witness to the incident has been questioned by police.

Superintendent Smith said there were 'concerns that people are withholding information which would progress it.'

It is alleged the group fled the house, despite Ms Jovanovic's injuries. Mr Panagakos (pictured) allegedly left his mother to phone for help

'The only people that know exactly what happened are those people who were in the house at the time. There is certainly that potential that it was an accident and if that's the case that's all more reason that someone should come forward and give a version,' he said, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

Mr Panagakos appeared in court in January, where he pleaded guilty to a string of charges - including unlawful possession of a weapon, failing to dispose of a syringe, receiving tainted property and other related offences.  

The charges are relation to a butterfly knife, taser and police cap allegedly found in the 27-year-old's bedroom at a home where he lived with his mother in September. 2019.

The court heard the items were found at the house his ex-girlfriend, Ms Jovanovic, was fatally shot three days prior - on September 8 - while getting ready for a night out.

Mr Panagakos had been in custody since his arrest on a return-to-prison warrant hours after the tragic shooting. 

Daily Mail Australia does not suggest Mr Panagakos was involved in his former girlfriend's death.

Mr Panagakos' solicitor Michael Gatenby told the court at the time the butterfly knife was among his client's large collection which 'regrettably, two of the items were unlawful,' The Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

He added his client had no idea the police hat, which belonged to a woman, was genuine.

'What's occurred is there's an incident at the home, for which my client is not charged,' Mr Gatenby told the court.

'And you can see a crime scene warrant is executed as a consequence of that, after my client's in police custody and police enter the home.'  

Mr Panagakos has an extensive criminal history and allegedly has links to the Mongols outlaw bikie gang.

He was sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars in Mackay Supreme Court in 2017 for drug offences. 

Mr Panagakos was then convicted of trying to smuggle drugs into jail after meth and valium dropped from his rectum as he was being searched after his sentencing. 

Mr Panagakos (pictured) will be eligible for parole next month, despite facing more jail time

He was released on parole after serving 10 months behind bars, which he breached by committing the most recent offences last September. 

Mr Panagakos was also recently released on parole after appearing in court in January.
