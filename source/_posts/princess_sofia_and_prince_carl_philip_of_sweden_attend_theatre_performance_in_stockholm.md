Princess Sofia and Prince Carl Philip of Sweden looked loved up this evening as they attended the preview of a theatre performance in Stockholm. 

The royal couple appeared to be in high spirits as they arrived for the preview of 'If I Say Something, It Only Gets Worse...' in Stockholm City Theatre in the country's capital.   

Sofia, 35, donned a monochrome chiffon blouse, paired with a pair of mint green paper-bag tailored trousers and a chunky matching belt. 

She wore matching court heels teamed with a grey leather handbag and wore minimal jewellery, other than her wedding rings.

Sofia wore her brunette tresses loose around her shoulders and showed off her glowing natural complexion with a natural makeup look. 

Her husband Carl, 40, cut a handsome figure in a classic suit paired with a white shirt and pocket square, and a navy blue tie. 

The couple waved at royal fans as they entered the venue and were pictured giving a speech before meeting the play's cast. 

Sofia dated her husband for five years before walking down the aisle in 2015 and the pair have two sons Prince Alexander, Duke of Södermanland, four and Prince Gabriel, three.

The royal appearance comes several months after Sofia started working in a hospital to help Sweden's fight against coronavirus.

The royal took a three-day medical course at Sophiahemmet University College in Stockholm, where she is an honorary chair member, in April, to help with the pandemic efforts.

Sophiahemmet University, also based in the Swedish capital, helped to train 80 people per week to ease the burden on medics in hospitals. 

Prince Carl Philip, Princess Sofia and their two sons have otherwise spent their summer enjoying staycations - with the family exploring local nature spots through walking, biking and swimming. 

During the pandemic, shops, bars and restaurants in Sweden have stayed open throughout and the wearing of masks has not been advised by the government.
