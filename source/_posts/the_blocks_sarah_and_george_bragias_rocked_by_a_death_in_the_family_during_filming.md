They recently spoke of the financial hardships they faced after losing their jobs to compete on The Block. 

And Sarah and George Bragias have now revealed they suffered even more heartbreak while filming show, following the tragic death of a family member.

Speaking to TV Week magazine on Monday, Sarah revealed she was mid-way through building a room on  The Block's Brighton construction site when news hit that her grandmother had died.  

'I was in utter shock': The Block's Sarah, 27, (left) and George Bragias, 33, (right) have revealed the heartbreaking way they found out about a death in the family during filming 

'George received a phone call and passed the phone over to me with a look I'll never forget,' Sarah, 27, said.  

The call was from Sarah's mother, who broke down in tears as she shared the sad news.  

'She told me nan had passed away earlier that day. I was in utter shock,' she said.

Sarah admitted that she struggled to work during the grieving process, but decided to push through the pain to deliver the completed room.  

'I was doing it in memory of my Nan,' she explained.

It comes after the couple told New Idea magazine that The Block had put them under a lot of financial pressure after George, 33, lost his job as an electrician in order to appear on the series.

What's more, schoolteacher Sarah had to take unpaid leave meaning that they were left with no income while they were filming. 

 'I lost my job to go on the show,' George said, adding: 'I had to be made redundant because I was taking so much time off.' 

Sarah also admitted that their lack of income became really 'concerning' when they received the bill for their mortgage.

'The funny thing is, the mortgage keeps going,' Sarah added. 

'We didn't know how we would repay our mortgage... So it was definitely concerning.'  

However the couple are hoping that the risk will pay off and that their previous experience renovating two homes and George's job as a tradie will see them take out the competition.
