Frenkie de Jong has revealed that Barcelona are in turmoil with Lionel Messi's transfer saga set to reach a head this week.

Messi's desire to leave Barcelona after 20 years has developed into one of the most stunning stories of the summer with the Argentine superstar recently handing in an official transfer request and refusing to attend scheduled Covid-19 tests in a bid to push through a move to Manchester City.

Messi's father Jorge will meet with Barcelona's president Josep Bartomeu on Wednesday to demand his son be allowed to leave amid his bitter dispute with the club over a contract clause which he believes means he can move on a free transfer.

Barcelona are in disarray, says Frenkie de Jong, as superstar Lionel Messi looks to jump ship

De Jong said it's 'chaos' at Barcelona at the moment with 'strange things happening'

De Jong, who endured a tough first season with the Catalan giants, admitted the club are in disarray as the fallout from their humiliating 8-2 defeat against Bayern Munich rumbles on. 

'Currently it's a mess at Barcelona, so many strange things happening. It's chaos,' the Holland international told NOS.

'I haven't talked to him (Messi) about this myself. Nor the club. So I honestly do not know how it is. 

'But if Messi really leaves, it will be a huge blow to the team and the club. 

'When I come back after these international matches, I will see what has happened at the club.' 

Messi has told Barcelona he wants to leave with Manchester City frontrunners to sign him

Dutchman de Jong also revealed that Messi is still in Barcelona players' WhatsApp group

Manchester City are hopeful of bringing Messi to the Premier League, though it would not be financially feasible to get a deal done if Barcelona continue to dig their heels in with the 33-year-old's release clause set at an eye-watering £629million.

Barcelona insist Messi is still under contract and have urged him to stop pursuing a move away and commit to a new deal.

Despite enormous uncertainty around his future, de Jong has revealed that Messi is still in the Barcelona players' group chat.

Speaking to Fox Sports, he added: 'I hope that Messi is still there when I get back, but that is not something that is up to me. 

'He's still in the group chat. I'm not someone who talks about it [his potential exit] with him, I'm sure he has many people around him doing that these days.'
