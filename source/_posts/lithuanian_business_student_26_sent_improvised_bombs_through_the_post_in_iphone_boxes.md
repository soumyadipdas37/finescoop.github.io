A student appeared in court today after allegedly sending 'incendiary' devices in parcels disguised as iPhone boxes - before triggering them to set fire to labels so he could claim refunds from Amazon, a court heard.

Ovidijus Margelis, 26, allegedly posted suspicious packages containing explosives while studying at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. 

But the Lithuanian disputes his charge of intent to cause an explosion because, his defence says, the incendiary devices inside the parcels were only intended to trigger a small flame.

The third-year Business Management student was said to have posted packages to addresses and claimed they were iPhones and other 'commercial items'.

But the carton boxes actually contained small devices that set alight when Margelis used his mobile phone to call them, it was said.

The fire made the packages untraceable, and allowed the student to claim refunds from Amazon and Paypal, according to the prosecution. 

A Cricklewood resident received a suspicious package containing an explosive device on Thursday, September 10 and called the police immediately.

Margelis was arrested at his home in Cambridge by officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command on Saturday and charged with three counts of intent to cause an explosion.

He is also charged with four fraud-related offences relating to the three-month scheme he is said to have carried out.

The student appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today via video link in a prison-issued grey tracksuit. He is currently in custody and spoke to confirm his name and address.

Misba Majid, prosecuting, said: 'This is a sophisticated offence, it has taken the defendant some time to put these things together.' 

Margelis, of Cambridge, is charged with three counts of intent to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or injure property.

He is also charged with possessing a controlled article for use in fraud, using criminal property and possessing identity documents with intent. 

No plea was entered.

Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said: 'I will deny bail for now but may reconsider the matter next Monday.'

He was remanded in custody and will next appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on October 21.
