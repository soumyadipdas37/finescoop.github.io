They've had a year to remember after their engagement in April.

Romance: They've had a year to remember after their engagement in April. And Chantelle Houghton, 37, looked as loved up as ever with her fiancé Michael Strutt on Sunday

Chantelle and Michael gazed into each other's eyes and she showed off her engagement ring while resting a hand on his cheek.

The star captioned the romantic pic: 'The look of love!!! I love my little family so much, everyday is a gift #family #love #sundayisfamilyday #family.'

The new photo comes after Chantelle said she still loves her ex-husband Preston.

The beauty waxed lyrical about her former flame last month, saying the Ordinary Boys singer is a very special person and he will even be invited to her wedding.

She told The Sun: 'Preston is a one-off person. What we had was real back then and I still love him so much.'

She said their relationship was special but they were too young to understand true love.

The star continued: 'Preston wished me congratulations and asked if he has got an invite, and I was like, "Of course!" And Michael is fine with it all. He understands what it is.' 

The mother-of-one admits that property developer Michael, 35, who she lives with in Wickford, Essex, is perfect for her.

Throwback: The new photo comes after Chantelle said she still loves her ex-husband Preston despite splitting 13 years ago, pictured together in 2006

The pair have only been dating for a short time but have known each other for nine years as Michael was Chantelle's mother's neighbour. 

She said at the time of their engagement: 'OK, I know it's lockdown and isolation but he just asked me to marry him: I said YES. I will love him for ever.'  

They had only started dating in January and decided to move in together at the start of lockdown.

And by April they were engaged after Michael got down on one knee while they were making spaghetti bolognese at home.

Chantelle found fame on Celebrity Big Brother 4 in 2006, where she was tasked with trying to the convince her fellow housemates she was a genuine star, by claiming she was a member of the pop group Kandy Floss. 

She went onto win that series of CBB and sparked a romance with Ordinary Boys singer Preston. They married seven months after leaving the house, before splitting in June 2007.
