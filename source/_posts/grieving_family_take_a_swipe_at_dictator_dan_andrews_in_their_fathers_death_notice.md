A grieving family have used a death notice to slam Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews' as a 'dictator' over his controversial Stage Four lockdown. 

The notice for husband, father and grandfather Peter Mitchell, published in  Wednesday's The Age, said they would only hold a memorial service for their dad the extreme lockdown ends.   

'Memorial Service to be held when the dictator is overthrown,' Mr Mitchell's family wrote in The Age. 

He died on Monday and was described as 'an exceptional man with an exceptional mind, wit and heart'.  

Mr Andrews has come under fire for Victoria's intense coronavirus restrictions and his roadmap out of Stage Four Lockdown.

'All I can say to people is if anger and frustration were like a vaccine against this virus, then we would all be in a much better position,' he said on Wednesday.

'We would all like to be open tomorrow. Myself included. 

'But to do that is not an act of leadership, that is to cave to some of the pressure that is there, to be driven by anger instead of epidemiology, to be driven by opinion instead of science and data and doctors. That is not what I'm about,' he said. 

Victoria recorded another day of double-digit coronavirus infections on Wednesday, with 76 new cases across the state.

A further 11 deaths have also been announced, taking the state's death toll to 694.  

The rise comes after Mr Andrews unveiled his road map out of Stage Four restrictions on Sunday - leaving many businesses devastated.

In order to move to the next step of easing restrictions on September 28, Melbourne must record an average daily infection rate between 30 and 50 over the next two weeks.  

Cafes, bars and restaurants will be able to have customers dine outside on October 26, as long as the statewide case average has fallen under five for the previous fortnight.

Customers won't be allowed inside until November 23 and only if there have been no cases at all for the previous two weeks. 

The strict draconian curfew enforced in Melbourne will be also be extended to October 26 but will be increased to 9pm-5am. Currently it begins at 8pm.
