Reece Hawkins' pregnant fiancée London Goheen lashed out at her Instagram followers this week, after they trolled her over a picture of her thumbs. 

On Monday, the 22-year-old model shared to Instagram images of herself showing off her baby bump, when fans accused her of Photoshopping the images because her fingers looked long.

London hit back on her Instagram story, saying: 'The internet is f**king wild and I'm sick of it.'

Over it: London hit back on her Instagram story, saying: 'The internet is f**king wild and I'm sick of it'

She added: 'Next time I'll be sure to make sure I look absolutely perfect so no one can attack me for my fingers. Geez. The internet is f**king wild and I'm sick of it.' 

It comes after she was slammed for charging her followers to see photos of her baby bump on OnlyFans.

London copped backlash on social media after revealing she was going to be charging people $14.99 per month on the subscription service.

OnlyFans is a subscription-based adult website where content can range from something as innocent as a suggestive selfie, all the way to hardcore pornography.

'She's literally charging people for her OnlyFans to view pics of her bump? What the f**k,' one follower commented on London's pregnancy announcement on Instagram. 

Another wrote: 'Wow sis is really charging $9.99 per month to see her pregnancy photos lol.'

One fan said that while she's happy for influencer Reece, 25, and London, they just can't comprehend coughing up the cash for the images.

'Congratulations. I would love to keep track of everything for your pregnancy. Just like with your relationship to watch you guys grow together... But I don't want to pay for an OnlyFans...'

However, another follower said that posting to OnlyFans is a good idea, saying it's 'so much safer and more secure!!' 

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia earlier this month, London defended her decision to show off her baby bump on OnlyFans.

'I have chosen to show detailed parts of my pregnancy on that platform because I've had to experience harassment and bullying for the last two years over my relationship with Reece,' she explained.

'I have 100 per cent control of my profile and what people have access to and comment on.

'I never said it was compulsory. People can choose if they wish to subscribe or not. If people don't like the idea of it or disagree with my decision then they don't have to be involved...

'We're just doing this to ensure a HAPPY POSITIVE FRUITFUL PREGNANCY.'

Earlier this month, Reece and London announced they were expecting their first child together, just weeks after getting engaged.
