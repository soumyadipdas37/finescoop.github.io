'Who ready?!!? #SAVAGEXFENTYSHOW,' the fashion designer captioned her teaser video. 

The clip begins on Rihanna's feet in a pair of fishnet tights and heels with straps that wrap up around her slim legs while the walking unmistakable clip-clop sound of stiletto's plays in the background.

The high-heel clad songstress is dressed in a long black robe with 'Rihanna' emblazoned on the back and she turns to give the camera a coy glance.

The rest of the Instagram clip features quick snap shots of the upcoming show with a look both behind the scenes and of the sultry lingerie designs on various models.

Forbes revealed in 2019 that Rihanna — who's real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty — is the richest female musical artist.

The Diamonds singer's $600 million net worth has eclipsed the fortunes earned by her peers Beyonce, Madonna and Celine Dion, according to the publication. 

In addition to her latest fashion ventures, Rihanna dipped into the world of cosmetics in 2017 with Fenty Beauty, a company which accrued nearly $570million in revenue in 2018.
