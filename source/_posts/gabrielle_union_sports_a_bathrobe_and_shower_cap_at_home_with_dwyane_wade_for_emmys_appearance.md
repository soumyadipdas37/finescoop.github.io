The no-audience event was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel at LA's Staples Center, while winners accepted their awards from their homes for the first time to adhere to California's social distancing rules amid the pandemic. 

While standing in front of a mirror and applying makeup, Gabrielle broke out in verses in honor of the popular HBO program created by Issa Rae.

Bouncy curls framed her flawless face and she wore a white shower cap with black polka dots holding back her hair. 

Toward the end of her freestyle, Dwyane stumbles upon his wife as she praises the program because 'they show the boys booties,' referring to the male nudity on Insecure.

'Rap career launched. Your welcome,' she captioned the video on Instagram. 'Its no secret we are huge Insecure fans so this was hella fun to do. Always winners in our house and in our hearts. Here's our bit in full. Love yall.'

The show was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, Lead Actress - Comedy Series, and Supporting Actress - Comedy Series, but ultimately lost out to the cast of Schitt's Creek.

Gabrielle covered a range of topics on Naomi Campbell's latest web series, No Filter, including Union's exit from America's Got Talent earlier this year and the ensuing investigation surrounding her departure. 

'When you walk in to a space and you recognize that change needs to happen sooner than later, [it's important] to speak up,' Gabrielle stated.

'And I'm confident that the wheels of change are turning faster, and we'll reach an amicable agreement. 'I will never regret speaking up. Ever. Never ever.'

Gabrielle was fired from the NBC program for speaking out on racial insensitivity and working in a toxic culture. 

She told Naomi that looking back on her career in Hollywood thus far, she's struck by 'the anti-blackness of it all,' which she called 'jarring and shocking, and it still is.

'There's a very narrow idea of what kind of black girl was acceptable and marketable.'

Unlike the usual hustle and bustle of prep for an awards show, Gabrielle enjoyed a relaxing day by the pool on Sunday.

She credited manicurist Thuy Nguyen for her nails and mentioned her own Flawless by Gabrielle Union hair care products while soaking up the sun.
