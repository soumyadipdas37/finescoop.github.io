Manchester United will monitor Harry Maguire to make sure he is able to remain as captain following his arrest ordeal in Mykonos.

Maguire has launched an appeal after he was found guilty of assaulting police, verbal abuse and attempted bribery following an incident on holiday on the Greek island, but it could take more than a year to come to court.

Solskjaer has stood by his skipper – who admitted he feared for his life during his arrest by plain-clothed police – and let him keep the armband, but admits the issue is bound to be on Maguire’s mind.

‘Knowing Harry, he's a very strong character so hopefully he can put that apart,’ said the United manager. ‘But naturally as a human being, it will be in back of mind what’s happened this summer.

‘Apart from that, you have just got to see how it develops with Harry. Personally I think he will be able to focus on his football but then who am I to … you can't predict how people will react, but so far he's trained well.

‘He’s been focused so hopefully that process will just go on and, of course, we know it’s something that will go on in the legal department over there.,
