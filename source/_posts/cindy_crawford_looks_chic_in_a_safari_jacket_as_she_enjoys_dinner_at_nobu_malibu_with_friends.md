Cindy Crawford looked effortlessly stylish on Wednesday night as she enjoyed a dinner out with friends in Malibu.

The 54-year-old supermodel was joined by some of her women friends for a visit to the swanky Japanese restaurant Nobu Malibu.

The runway star had all eyes on her thanks to her chic safari jacket. 

On the town: Cindy Crawford, 54, looked chic in a tan safari jacket as she arrived at the swanky Japanese restaurant Nobu Malibu on Wednesday for a night out with her girlfriends

The tan item featured double breast and waist pocket, and she had it cinched tightly around her waist. 

Cindy added a splash of color to her muted outfit with a burnt orange satin skirt covered in festive palm tree designs. 

She elevated her 5ft9in stature with a set of brown mule heels and wore a white mask to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, though some of her friends eschewed masks in the parking lot.

She accessorized with a brown suede bag slung over one shoulder while she carried a slim black case in her other hand.

Cindy appeared to be having a girls' night out without her husband Rande Gerber, 58.

The two married in 1998, making it the second marriage for Cindy, who was previously married to Richard Gere, and they celebrated their 22nd wedding anniversary in May. 

The two know a thing or two about the restaurant business themselves, as Rande owns the Cuban restaurant Cafe Habana nearby in Malibu.

As the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has decimated restaurant profits, their son Presley Gerber has been putting in shifts at the restaurant on and off.

Cindy's outing came a week after she and Rande sold their mid-century modern Beverly Hills home for an impressive $16 million.

The couple stand to profit off the house, which they purchased three years ago for $11.625 million from New Republic frontman Ryan Tedder.

Cindy and Rande, who was formerly a model, shared Presley, 21, and Kaia Gerber, 19, both of whom followed their parents into modeling.

Mother and daughter recently shared the honor of gracing alternate covers for Vogue Italia's September issue.

The magazine put out 100 different covers for the issue subtitled 'Hope,' with the fashion icon gracing number 99 and her daughter standing along on the 100th cover.
