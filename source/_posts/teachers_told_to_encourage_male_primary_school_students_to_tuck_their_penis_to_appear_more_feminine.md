Primary school teachers are being given resources to encourage male students to tuck their penis or wear a padded bra to appear more feminine. 

Links on the School Biz portal for teachers, provided by the NSW Department of Education, transfer to a 40-page booklet titled 'OMG I'm Trans'.

It also includes a series of other materials on gender fluidity and same-sex relationships, including fictional books called 'The Gender Fairy, Are you a Boy or Are you a Girl' and 'Sex Is A Funny Word: A Book About Bodies, Feelings and You'. 

The public education body said the links are operated by third parties and the materials were deemed safe for children in an independent review in 2016.

But in a series of explosive tweets on Wednesday, One Nation MP Mark Latham accused the government of reinstating the controversial Safe Schools program 'by stealth'.

'NSW Govt supposedly abolished Safe Schools in 2017 but Education Dept staff kept working on compiling a full library of this rubbish from around the world,' Mr Latham wrote on Twitter

Safe Schools included the idea that gender is a 'non-binary' or 'fluid' concept, as part of queer gender theory.

The program was plagued with accusations from critics who believed the ideas on gender theory were too radical for children since its introduction in 2010.

It was eventually axed in 2017, but Mr Latham claims the government have sneakily brought it back.

'NSW Govt supposedly abolished Safe Schools in 2017 but Education Dept staff kept working on compiling a full library of this rubbish from around the world,' he wrote on Twitter.

'They sent it to teachers behind Internet wall. The public was not supposed to find out.'  

OMG I'm Trans contains information on gender pronouns, same-sex relationships and how to disguise gender.

It suggests young males wear bra inserts, 'tuck' their penis to 'create a flat front in the pants', and 'pack' their backside to make it appear larger and more feminine.

The lengthy PDF also has information for young girls about 'binding' breasts to appear more masculine. 

A spokesman for the Federal Department of Education said the materials were found to be age-appropriate (stock image of a woman with a primary school-aged child)

'It's absolutely brought back by stealth,' Mr Latham told The Daily Telegraph.

'Behind a firewall they are sending information to teachers which resurrects Safe Schools despite the government ending it. There was a reason this was kicked out of schools in the first place. There has been no disclosure.'

Institute of Public Affairs director of the Foundations of Western Civilisation Program Dr Bella d'Abrera shared Mr Latham's opinion and said the resources are 'social engineering'.

She also said teachers should not be 'politicising impressionable children' in the classroom'.

A spokesman for the Federal Department of Education said the materials were found to be age-appropriate and aligned with the Australian curriculum.

'The resources were originally published in 2013 as part of the original Safe Schools Hub that was funded by the previous Labor Government,' he said. 

Following the independent review in 2016, the resources were returned to the hub.
