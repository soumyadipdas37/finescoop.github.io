Australian lingerie designer and model Natalie Roser has blasted Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims for being 'wasteful' in its new advertising campaign. 

The campaign, which was shot by photographer Vanessa Beecroft, sees a unitard-clad Kim, 39, sitting on the floor surrounded by piles of shapewear in different skin-tones. 

The floor and backdrop were also completely covered in the garments.

Reposting an image from the campaign to her own Instagram account, Natalie, 30, wrote on Wednesday: 'So much excess. So many products to line the walls and floor of a studio. What happened to it after the shoot?' 

'I watch Skims closely as it's a competitor for Rose & Bare, but this campaign clearly sets us apart,' Natalie declared.  

'Rose & Bare is not fast fashion. We strive for minimal waste, reusing as much as we can, even the fabric cut offs, we use to secure items in transport (and I use them as hair ties!)' she continued.

Continuing her comparison between the two brands, Natalie wrote: 'One year for Skims with a huge budget and reach and one year for Rose & Bare as a self funded start up.' 

'And I like to think that Rose & Bare holds a more sustainable future as a brand with a soul,' she continued.

The blonde ended her rant with a more positive take on the situation, explaining that the popularity of Kim's brand means there is a future for skin colour-inclusive lingerie.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Skims for comment. 

Natalie launched her lingerie brand in May last year after noticing a gap in the Australian lingerie market. 

'Australia is such a beautiful, multicultural country and I was surprised that so many underwear brands ignored the diversity of Australian women.' Natalie told POPSUGAR at the time. 

'So I started working on Rose and Bare to solve that problem and provide a greater spectrum of 'nude' underwear,'' she said.
