Her confident post comes after the reality star's ex Tom Kemp was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on September 3 after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.  

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year.

But Kemp, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.

Malin and Kemp had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims he had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth. 

heir baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.

They split again last March, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief.

Malin now wrestles with PTSD, after the abusive relationship left her mental health and self-esteem in tatters.

She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety.

'The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'
