The younger sister of fashion star Kate Moss added a touch of edge to her outfit as she opted for knee-high boots.

With her locks worn in a straight fashion, the influencer accentuated her features with a neutral-toned make-up look.

Habbs, 26, who is currently dating reality star Jamie Laing, 31, went for an equally edgy appearance in a leather jacket, a white T-shirt and a patterned mini-skirt.

The Gi swim founder let her natural beauty shine through in just minimal foundation, and carried her essentials in a scribble print handbag by Balenciaga.

Meanwhile, in the romance department, Lottie fuelled dating speculation as she spent time with Love Island star Chris Hughes during her recent holiday.

In videos and pictures shared to Instagram, the reality star, 27, can be seen putting on a cosy display with the blonde, and even proceeds to drape his leg over her.

Media personality Chris split from his ex-girlfriend, Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson, in April. 

The singer, 29, is said to have called it quits over the phone after their 16-month relationship 'run its course'. 

Lottie was recently linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host.

News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury.

A mutual friend told The Sun on Sunday: 'They have known each other through the party circuit for a few years, but nothing has ever happened before.

'Roman's always thought she was beautiful, and decided to pluck up the courage to ask her out.'   

MailOnline contacted representatives for Lottie and Roman for comment at the time of publication.
