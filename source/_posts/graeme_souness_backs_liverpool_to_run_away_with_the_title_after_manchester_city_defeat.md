Graeme Souness has said he reckons Liverpool could 'run away' with the Premier League after Manchester City's staggering 5-2 defeat to Leicester.

Manchester City's defensive frailties from last season were back in full-force as Pep Guardiola's side were comfortably beaten at the Etihad Stadium.

They didn't do themselves any favours too with defenders Eric Garcia, Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy all giving away sloppy penalties.

Manchester City are set to secure the signing of Benfica defender Ruben Dias, but Souness said he still fancies Liverpool to retain the title.  

He said on Sky Sports: 'Liverpool won by 18 points (last season). Liverpool in my opinion have strengthened big time.

'I look at City now whether Ruben Dias comes in, it'll have to be more than Dias to take City from 18 points behind Liverpool to getting in front of them.

'Liverpool are stronger today than they were 12 months ago. That's a marker, when you look at what City have shown.

'After all the teams we've seen that can challenge, it's Leicester after today but we're three games in. 

'Some players need five or six (games) to get up to speed. But right now, I think Liverpool could run away with it.' 

Ruben Dias is expected to arrive at City in the coming hours after waving goodbye to Benfica on Saturday, another new central defender signed under Pep Guardiola after already signing Nathan Ake this summer.

Dias will cost in the region of £64million, with Nicolas Otamendi going the other way for around £14m.

Manchester City will need to improve defensively if they are to reclaim the Premier League title they lost to Liverpool last season.

Riyad Mahrez scored the opener for Guardiola's side against Leicester and it looked like it could be an easy afternoon for the home side.

But by the 60 minute mark Leicester found themselves 3-1 ahead thanks to a hat-trick by Jamie Vardy, who the Manchester City defence could not handle all afternoon. 

James Maddison then scored a curling effort from outside the box in fantastic style.

Ake got his first goal for the club to close the deficit but Leicester got another penalty, this time converted by Tielemans.

It leaves Manchester City 13th after two games after winning their opener against Wolves.
