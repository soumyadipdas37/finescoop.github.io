A soft, fleecy blanket is great to have all year round. Whether used on the bed as an additional layer or draped on the sofa ready for a Netflix session, it really comes into its own on chilly nights in. 

If you're looking for the softest, cosiest throw you can find, then it might be worth trusting the 12,000 reviews on Amazon who have scored the Bedsure Sherpa Blanket a near-flawless 4.8 out of 5. 

The bed blanket has been backed by thousands of shoppers who have described it as 'like velvet', 'so warm and soft and snuggly' and 'the cosiest blanket ever'. And, with prices from just £14.87 in Amazon's Lightening Sale, there's never been a better time to stock up. 

Over 12,000 people have reviewed the Bedsure Sherpa Blanket, giving it a near-perfect score of 4.8 out of 5 

A soft throw is a great way of adding texture and colour to a room. The Bedsure Sherpa Blanket is available in 13 gorgeous colours including neutral camel, silver grey and navy. Or, if you're looking to inject a splash of colour to a space, then you could opt for the mustard, green or orange. 

Whatever colour you pick, the blanket is reversible with the coloured side a silky soft fleece and a fluffy sherpa on the reverse.  

It's currently the number one bestselling item in Amazon's 'Bed Throws' department- and it's not hard to see why so many people love it. 

'Very soft and warm. Just what my daughter wanted for curling up on the sofa to watch TV but it also looks nice folded over the bottom of her bed. One side is a grey smooth and velvety, the other is a soft white fleece.'

Another shopper raved: 'My new favourite thing. An absolutely wonderful product. Possibly the softest thing I've ever felt and so warm! It's perfect for snuggling on the sofa or putting on top of the duvet for an extra layer on a cold night.'

Customers are finding plenty of use for the snuggly throw: 'The dark grey side is so soft, like velvet, and the sherpa fleece side is lovely and soft too but not as silky as the velvet side, so it helps the throw stay on the sofa and not slide off like some other throws I've had. I liked them so much I ended up buying 4.' 

The dual-sided super soft blanket has a fleece face and plush sherpa reverse, perfect for snuggling up with in bed or on the sofa 

The Bedsure Sherpa Blanket is available in various sizes so you can pick which one is best for your space. Shoppers have reported that the sizes do run big, with the double easily fitting over a double bed.  

'This blanket is a lovely big size and great for wrapping yourself in to keep warm on cold mornings rather than switch on the electric fan heater. It really does keep you snug. I also use it as an extra blanket on the bed and it makes so much difference.'

Another wrote: 'Amazing- so so warm and soft and snuggly. I got a double size one because I find usually blankets aren't big enough to wrap around me and my feet when I'm stretched out on the sofa, but the double is soooo big, I could've probably got the single one because the double is huge!'
