Paul Pogba's blushes were spared by the Video Assistant Referee after the Manchester United man conceded a penalty at Brighton.

The French midfielder clumsily brought down Aaron Connolly as he closed in on goal early in the second-half at the Amex Stadium.

Referee Chris Kavanagh immediately pointed to the penalty spot and booked Pogba but was advised to review the decision on the pitchside monitor by VAR official Simon Hooper.

The replays showed that Connolly had initiated the contact by reaching back and tugging the front of Pogba's shirt as they strained to reach the ball.

That was enough for Kavanagh to overturn his decision and rescind the yellow card for Pogba, much to Connolly's frustration.

It would have been the second penalty awarded against a sluggish United side in the game.

Bruno Fernandes bundled over Tariq Lamptey in the 37th minute with the penalty confirmed after a VAR check.

Brighton forward Neal Maupay scored a cheeky Panenka penalty past David de Gea to hand the home side the lead.

United equalised just before half-time, however, when Harry Maguire shot from close range with the final touch coming off Brighton defender Lewis Dunk.

And Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, having seen two goals disallowed themselves, went into the lead through Marcus Rashford on 55 minutes.

Brighton felt they should have been awarded another spot-kick not long afterwards when Connolly went down under pressure from Maguire but Kavanagh waved away appeals and VAR confirmed his decision.
