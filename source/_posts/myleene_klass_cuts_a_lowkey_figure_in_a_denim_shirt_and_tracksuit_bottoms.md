Despite her casual attire, Myleene still added a designer edge to her look with a classic black Chanel bag and oversized shades.

The mother-of-three opted for comfort in a pair of black Alexander McQueen trainers and further accessorised with a selection of pendant chains.

Myleene was all smiles as she stepped out following the news she would be taking to the Dancing On Ice rink early next year.

She said that she's 'up for the challenge' and wants to make her daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, 'proud'. 

Myleene told her fans: 'Guess who won't be holding the coats at the side of the rink anymore! I am so, SO excited to be joining the cast of Dancing On Ice.

'My girls have always wanted me to do this but I've always been too scared someone will skate over my fingers!  

'Anyway, I want to make them proud and show them I'm up for a challenge when completely out of my comfort zone but most of all, I want a bum like Jlo!'

Myleene's exciting new challenge also comes just one week after she revealed she had gotten engaged to the father of her one-year-old son Apollo, Simon Motson.  

The mother-of-three was astounded when her partner of five years popped the question with a nine-carat diamond ring on the fifth anniversary of their first date. 

Joining Myleene on the ice next year are stars including Denise Van Outen, Jason Donovan, Coronation Street's Faye Brooks and Emmerdale's Joe-Warren Plant. 

Dancing On Ice will return to ITV in the new year and see twelve celebrities skate live with their professional partners each week.

The duos will try to impress both the panel and the viewers who will ultimately decide who is crowned the winner of the show.

Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby once again return to present the show and the expert panel of Torvill and Dean, John Barrowman and Ashley Banjo will all resume their roles as judges
