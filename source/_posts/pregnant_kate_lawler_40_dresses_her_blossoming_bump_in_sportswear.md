Speaking with Hello! magazine, Kate explained they started trying for a baby after their wedding was cancelled and she's 'never felt more ready' to be a mum.   

Kate added the pregnancy was 'completely planned' after her nuptials were rearranged twice due to the coronavirus pandemic.

She explained: 'The wedding got cancelled and I wasn't thinking about a baby at all. 

'But when we rebooked it for the following year, a few of our friends and family said we could have a baby between now and then.

'I laughed, but then I turned 40 in May and suddenly I felt grown up and like I was ready for something and I didn't know what it was.' 

The reality star also said she had felt 'pressurised' in the past but is happy that she waited to have a child until it felt right.

Kate, who won Big Brother in 2002, said: 'I think I am going to be a much happier person knowing that I did this when I wanted to.'   

Ultrasound: Kate showed ultrasound scans on Tuesday and joked her bundle of joy was 'entertaining' 

Adorable: Another scan made it look like Kate's little one was waving and holding a thumbs up

Sweet: She gushed, 'A head, a thumbs up, a wave, a teeny foot and the universal symbol for #SmashYerFaceIn. Baby Boj gave us quite an entertaining performance at the 16 week scan'

During the candid interview, Kate also told the magazine doctors said she had a low egg count and this helped contribute to her being ready to become a mother.

The star explained how she knew the 'decision would be taken out of her hands eventually' and she was 'sad' at thinking she wouldn't be able to conceive.    

Sharing the news on social media, she wrote: 'Still can’t believe we’re adding another set of paws to our pack and this time it’s not another dog.'  

Kate previously discussed the possibility of having children last September during another Hello! interview, saying her partner of eight years Martin really wanted to start a family.

The issue became the subject of several 'heated arguments' between the pair and features as the central theme to a podcast hosted by them, called Maybe Baby.

Asked what would happen if Kate didn't change her mind, she revealed fears of Martin divorcing her after they tie the knot. 

'He always said we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. And I know what that means - that we'd get divorced,' she said.  

But the radio DJ, who presents Virgin drive time, added that Martin recently offered her reassurance with a sweet comment. 

She told the magazine: 'But a couple of weeks ago, he said: "If you decide you really don't want kids, I'm okay with that. I would rather have you and not have children than not have you. " It was the first time he'd ever said that.'
