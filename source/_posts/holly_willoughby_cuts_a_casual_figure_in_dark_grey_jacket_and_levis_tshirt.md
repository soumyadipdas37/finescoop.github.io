She's getting back to reality after her summer break from This Morning.

And Holly Willoughby cut a casual figure as she ran errands near her London home on Saturday morning. 

The presenter, 39, nailed daytime chic in a dark grey jacket and Levi's t-shirt for the low-key outing.

She finished off her trendy look with a pair of navy jeans and grey trainers as she clutched a large black handbag.

Holly appeared downcast as she made her way along the street while talking on the phone.

The mother-of-three wore her trademark blonde tresses loose and looked radiant as she went makeup free for the the trip out.

Her outing comes after Holly lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections.

Talking on Thursday's This Morning she asked whether she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, or father Terry, on Christmas due to having a family of five.  

On Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'.

Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. 

Holly has three children - Harry, 11, Belle, nine, and Chester, five, with husband Dan Baldwin meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'. 

Discussing the new restrictions with Matthew Wright on This Morning, the ITV star said: 'A lot of people are thinking, "What will this mean for Christmas? What will Christmas look like?"

'It's going to be very awkward in my house as I'm a family-of-five, so I'll have to choose between my mum and dad on Christmas day!'  

To which Matthew, 55, replied: 'I'm feeling very confused and conflicted. The rules are different everywhere else in the United Kingdom. 

'You can't have your parents over on Christmas Day but you can go on public transport? For the life of me, I can't make any sense of it.'

With Holly adding: 'I guess the other thought is how is anyone going to police these rules. The government are going to have marshals to monitor people.'
