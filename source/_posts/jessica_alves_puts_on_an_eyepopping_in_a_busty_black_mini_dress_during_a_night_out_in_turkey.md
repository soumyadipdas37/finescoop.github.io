She recently jetted off to Turkey for a sun-soaked getaway.

And Jessica Alves put on an eye-popping display in a busty black mini dress as she enjoyed a night out in the Turkish city of Bodrum on Friday.

The TV personality, 37, struggled to contain her ample assets in the plunging blazer-style gown as she stepped out for a night on the town during her holiday.

Jessica oozed glamour in the figure-hugging number, which she paired with pointed black stilettos and a black handbag.

Completing her dazzling look, the star wore her blonde locks in a poker straight style while adding a pop of colour with bold red lipstick.

Jessica was clearly enjoying the limelight as she stepped out of the car and pulled a number of poses for the camera.

Her night out comes after she showed off her figure in a plunging leopard print swimsuit while on a beach in Turkey.

Feeling body confident, she posed in front of a fruit platter, before seductively eating some grapes on Instagram Stories. 

The Brazilian-born star had earlier headed down to the beach wearing a black cover-up over the top of her one-piece, cinching in her waist with an embellished belt. 

She also channelled a bygone era, wearing her blonde hair extensions in a chic chignon. 

Jessica, formerly known as the Human Ken Doll Rodrigo Alves, has spent more than £600,000 on surgeries, deciding to transition earlier this year.

She has recently undergone facial feminisation surgery, breast enlargement and bottom augmentation. 

She previously told MailOnline she finally feels like her outside appearance reflects her inner self. 

She said: 'I wish I had started my transition sooner, rather than wasting time and money trying to become the man that I wasn't. 

'I am much happier now and feel more like myself.' 

Wow! Jessica showed off her ample assets in a skimpy leopard print swimsuit as she tucked into a fruit platter while on the beach in Turkey on Instagram on Thursday

Meanwhile, it was recently announced that Jessica has landed a major dating show which will see her travel around the world in a bid to try to find love - and the father of her baby. 

The TV star, previously known as Rodrigo, came out as transgender just months ago and now dreams of becoming a mother. 

The show has a working title of Love Me Gender: Everyone Deserves A Bit Of Love In Life and Jessica has said she is missing having a special someone.

She told MailOnline: 'Everyone deserves to have love in their life and I need a little help in that department. It feels different dating as a woman. 

'I speak six languages and I will be travelling to different countries where I can speak the language, including the UK, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, the USA, Brazil and The Netherlands.

'Then I'll pick the best date from each country and get them all together at a big Love Island style villa, before choosing the winner.'
