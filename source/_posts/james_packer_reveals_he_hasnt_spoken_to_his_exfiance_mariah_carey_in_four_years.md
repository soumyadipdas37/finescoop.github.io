Australian businessman James Packer has revealed he hasn't spoken to his ex-fiancée US superstar Mariah Carey in four years.

The billionaire told Sydney Morning Herald's Private Sydney on Saturday, the former couple haven't been in contact since their split in 2016.

The 53-year-old also said he 'wishes Mariah well' as she prepares to release her new tell-all memoir titled The Meaning Of Mariah.

'I wish her well,' he told the publication. 

He went on to say he hasn't seen a copy of Mariah's book and isn't sure how much is devoted to their relationship.

'I haven't seen an advance copy or spoken to Mariah for four years,' he said.

James dated US superstar Mariah for 18 months before the former couple called off their engagement in 2016.

In February 2016, just one month after he proposed to Mariah with a USD$10million (AUD$12.7million) 35-carat diamond ring, James was apparently not coping well. 

Eventually, the toll became too much and the relationship collapsed, with James and Mariah abruptly calling it quits in October that year. 

Following their split Mariah reportedly sold the engagement ring her ex-fiancé gave her in early 2016 for a fraction of the price.

According to the New York Post, a source claimed that one of Mariah's business managers 'quietly' sold the ring to an LA jeweller for $2.78million (US$2.1million). 

Mariah also reportedly received a USD$50million (AUD $70million) 'inconvenience fee' after the breakup, with The Daily Telegraph reporting she was initially 'poised to accept $7million to walk away' before allegedly upping the sum.

Meanwhile, the US singer is set to release her tell-all memoir titled The Meaning Of Mariah on September 29. 

On the back of the book, Mariah wrote: 'It took me a lifetime to have the courage and the clarity to write my memoir. I want to tell the story of the moments - the ups and downs, the triumphs and traumas, the debacles and the dreams, that contributed to the person I am today.'

The mother of two continued: 'Though there have been countless stories about me throughout my career and very public personal life, it's been impossible to communicate the complexities and depths of my experience in any single magazine article or a ten-minute television interview.'

She also said that 'writing this memoir was incredibly hard, humbling and healing. My sincere hope is that you are moved to a new understanding, not only about me, but also about the resilience of the human spirit.'
