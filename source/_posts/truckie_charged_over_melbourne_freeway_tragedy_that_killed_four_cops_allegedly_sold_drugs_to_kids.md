Mohinder Singh - who allegedly killed four police officers in a horror crash on Melbourne's Eastern Freeway in April - is accused of trafficking cannabis and meth to a child 

A truck driver accused of killing four police officers when his vehicle ploughed into them on a busy Melbourne freeway has been charged with supplying illegal drugs to a child.

Mohinder Singh was charged with culpable driving causing death following the April 22 crash on the Eastern Freeway in Kew, inner-city Melbourne and last month hit with another 33 charges - including drug trafficking.

Singh, 47, is accused of hitting the officers with his truck after they had pulled over Porsche-driving mortgage broker Richard Pusey, 42, who was allegedly clocked driving at 149km/h while under the influence of methamphetamine and cannabis.

Pusey himself is facing more than a dozen charges after also allegedly filming the crash site and verbally abusing a senior constable as she lay dying.

Court documents have revealed Singh allegedly trafficked cannabis to a child for their use on April 5.

He also allegedly trafficked cannabis and meth to a child between April 10 and April 16.

Richard Pusey, the driver of a Porsche who allegedly fled the scene of the truck crash, is taken away from his Fitzroy property by police on April 23

Singh, from the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Cranbourne, fronted Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday - where his lawyer said the truck driver needed to meet face-to-face with an expert witness before his court case could continue,  NCA NewsWire reported.

Among Singh's other charges are dangerous driving causing death and driving under the influence.

Leading Senior Constable Lynnette Taylor, Senior Constable Kevin King and constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney were killed while they were impounding Pusey's Porsche on the freeway.   

A Connect Logistics' refrigerated chicken truck veered across the freeway and hit the four officers, who were on the side of the road pulling over Pusey.

They were in the process of impounding the mortgage broker's Porsche 911.

Pusey avoided being struck in the crash as he had been urinating off to the side of the road. 

The 47-year-old is already facing charges of culpable driving after the April 22 incident that killed Lynnette Taylor, Kevin King, Glen Humphris and Joshua Prestney 

Public funerals were held for all four officers after the tragedy, which marked the single greatest loss of police life in Victoria's history.  

Pusey (pictured) is facing more than a dozen charges 

Pusey, of Fitzroy, was initially charged with 12 offences include driving at a dangerous speed, reckless conduct endangering life, destruction of evidence, perverting the course of justice, failing to remain at the scene after a drug test and failing to render assistance.

He was arrested a day after the crash on April 23 and was hit with a further two charges in June, including behaving in an indecent or offensive manner and committing an act outraging public decency. 

Last month, Magistrate Donna Bakos granted Pusey's lawyer Chris McLennan access to 177 pages of Pusey's medical documents to support his case, but some additional pages were not included because they could 'identify others'. 

The details of the documents were not disclosed to the court and prosecutor Jason Ong did not ask for access.
