Argentina legend Hernan Crespo has said that Lionel Messi should not have put his father in charge of brokering a deal away from Barcelona.

His dad Jorge was heavily involved after Messi dropped a bombshell by burofax that he intended to quit the Nou Camp.

The 33-year-old believed there was a clause in the contract that would allow him to talk for free, but the club insisted that any interested team would have to fork out €700million.

Lionel Messi had dropped a bombshell on Barcelona expressing his desires to leave the club

Jorge Messi was involved in trying to broker a deal out of the club, but Lionel made a U-turn

Messi's dad held discussions with the club but in the end the six time Ballon D'or winner made a U-turn and decided to stay as he wished to avoid any legal dispute with the club he loves.

Crespo believes Messi should have hired a specialist to help get his move away from the club.

The former Chelsea, AC Milan and Parma striker told TyC Sports: 'He doesn't stop being the father and in those circumstances you need a professional.    

'It's not the same as an agent speaking: it's a father speaking. The agent is not going to look at family sentiment.

'I don't want to detract from his father, but he does not have the background in terms of these things compared to others.

'We're talking about directors, contracts and money. You need someone who can handle himself in that setting.'

Hernan Crespo thinks Messi would have got his Barcelona exit with the help of a professional

Messi's decision means that Barcelona now have one-year left to try and persuade the club's greatest ever player to remain at the Nou Camp, when his contract expires.

The Argentine striker wished to leave the club due to mounting issues both on and off the field.

He said in an interview with Goal that he felt his time at the club was over and 'suffered in training, games and in the dressing room'.
