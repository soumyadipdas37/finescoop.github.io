They're celebrating seven years of marriage this week. 

And on Tuesday, Nova star Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli revealed the hilarious gift he gave wife Lisa on their anniversary. 

And while the thought was there, the 40-year-old revealed on his Fitzy and Wippa radio show that his wife was not impressed when he presented her with an AIR FRYER. 

'I thought I nailed it': On his radio show on Tuesday, Nova star Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli revealed the disaster gift he gave wife Lisa on their seventh wedding anniversary

'What became the issue was when we did the present exchange because I thought I'd nailed it,' Wippa said. 

'I don't know come up with this idea in the last couple of days. I put effort into it, I put thought into it,' he said. 

After sharing a video of Lisa unwrapping the gift on Instagram, Wippa said that she was asking 'a lot of questions.'

Sorry Lisa! And while the thought was there, the 40-year-old revealed on his Fitzy and Wippa radio show that his wife was not impressed when he presented her with an AIR FRYER

Pricey! A Philips air fryer costs around $300- $600

'There was a lot of questions, a lot of confusion. I think the main message here was extreme disappointment,' he said. 

'Lisa made a good point last night when she said "yeah, but what's the difference between this and an oven?" 

He said that Lisa gifted him a voucher for a massage.   

He said he was convinced to buy an air fryer, with a Philips one averaging $300- $600, as their friend Hamish Blake is 'obsessed' with it and meals are said to be healthier.

Wippa also wrote underneath the video he posted on Instagram of the gift unwrapping: 'Besides Hamish Blake, can anyone else convince my wife that this an AMAZING anniversary present! Nothing says I love you like air fried chips. At this stage Lisa is not impressed!'

Lisa joked about the air fryer online, sharing a tribute to Wippa to mark their anniversary. 

Underneath some pictures of their wedding day, she wrote: 'Seven years married to the love of my life.' 

'I got an air fryer as a gift and we had takeaway pizza for dinner. The romance is definitely still alive.'  

The pair married in 2013. They share three children together, Theodore, four, Jack, three, and Francesca, five months.
