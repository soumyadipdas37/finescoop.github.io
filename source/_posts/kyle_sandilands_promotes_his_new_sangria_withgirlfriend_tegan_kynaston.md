He's the radio titan who launched a successful brand of coconut water several years ago.

And now, Kyle Sandilands has teamed up with his girlfriend Tegan Kynaston's family to create a new premium wine, Nueva Sangria. 

In an advertisement for the label, the 48-year-old explained he's 'come up with a new Aussie twist on a Spanish classic'.

'Welcome everyone to my newest project, this is Nueva Sangria,' he said.

'I've teamed up with winemakers Dave Kynaston, Sam Bowman and Tegan Kynaston to come up with a new Aussie twist on a Spanish classic,' he continued.

Kyle continued: 'Nueva Sangria is the end result of daring to ask the question "Why can't we make our sangria right here on Australian soil?"' 

'As the Nueva Sangria story continues along, I'm proud we all raise a glass to what got us here and for the good times ahead,' he ended.

Business: Kyle first launched Nueva Sangria in March 2019 but it is currently only available to purchase online

The new business venture comes after Kyle launched H2Coco in 2014, a brand of natural flavoured coconut water sold in major retailers like Coles and Woolworths.  

When H2Coco was first announced, it was reported King Kyle Investments owned 23 per cent of the business.
