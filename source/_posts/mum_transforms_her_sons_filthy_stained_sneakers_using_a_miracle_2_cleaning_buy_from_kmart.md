A clever Australian mum has revealed how she used an unlikely $2 Kmart product to clean her son's filthy sneakers.

Mum Carman posted photos to the Mums Who Clean Facebook group and said she used Kmart's budget cleaning erasers, which are priced at $2 for a packet of six.

The laundry product is often used to remove stains from walls, material and clothing, but Carman said they worked well at cleaning the shoes too.

'Love these erasers, they clean everything especially my shower bases and screens,' one person said.

'These magic erasers are so good for cleaning and so cheap!! Definitely recommend,' another said.
