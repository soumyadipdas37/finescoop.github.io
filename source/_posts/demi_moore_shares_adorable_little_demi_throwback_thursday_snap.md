Moore also made headlines in July, when she admitted that she 'changed herself' in all three of her marriages to Freddie Moore, Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher.

'For me, I changed myself over and over to fit what I thought somebody else wanted,' Demi explained. 

'Working through a relationship is really commendable in our disposable times,' she continued.

 'To go through the journey of really honoring the love that brought you together in the first place, and to really give it all you’ve got, but you can't do that without that love and acceptance of yourself,' she added.

Moore has starred in two mini-series' this summer, an adaptation of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World in July and Dirty Diana in August.
