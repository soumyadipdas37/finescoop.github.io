Finding a pair of soft, sweat-wicking leggings that are also squat proof and super comfortable is no-mean feat, especially when you're on a budget.  

However, Amazon shoppers have found a pair that tick all the above boxes and come in a huge array of cool prints and colours. Oh, and they cost just £15.99. 

With over 1,400 reviews on Amazon, it's clear that the OUGES Womens High Waist Yoga Pants has a dedicated following. And for good reason. 

The £15.99 OUGES Womens High Waist Yoga Pants are being snapped up in a range of colours 

The OUGES Womens High Waist Yoga Pants have caught the attention of hundreds of Amazon shoppers, thanks to their impressive quality and incredibly flattering fit. 

In fact, the OUGES Leggings have caused a bit of a storm among reviewers online, with shoppers raving about the super affordable price tag - so much so that they're snapping them up in multiple prints and colours. 

The leggings come in a whopping 28 colours and prints including marble, leopard print, python and florals. The stylish leggings also come in two kinds of crops. The full length is ideal for autumn runs, while the 20inch length is perfect for practicing yoga. 

One shopper raved: 'Comfortable, soft, opaque and breathable, some of the best leggings I've ever bought and by far the most affordable! Love the pockets, will be buying more!'

Another added: 'Pants are shockingly soft and comfortable. They fit true to size. Seriously, so comfortable! You know how 'no pants are the best pants'? Buy them. You won't be disappointed. I will be back for more colors.'

The high waistband cinches you in, helping you feel supported, while the side pockets are handy for keeping your phone in whilst out for a run 

A third raved: 'These are by far the most soft and flexible fitness leggings I've ever owned! They are squat proof as well as have a full functional pocket for your devices or wallet!'

While perhaps not as sweat-wicking as more expensive brands, the soft-hand feel is comparable. Designed with an Elastane blend, the OUGES Leggings are soft and stretchy, giving you that naked feeling, so you're free to run, squat and lunge without restriction. The high-rise fit means your tummy is pulled in and supported too. 

'Excellent running leggings. I am very impressed with them,' wrote one delighted shopper. 'The fit is good and they are very comfortable. They have a nice high waist which doesn't slip down when I'm running. 

'The pockets on the side of the legs are perfect for holding my phone so that I can track my run and no longer need a separate phone carrier.' 

A yoga fan also agreed, writing: 'Stylish and comfortable. These yoga pants fit very well. They are comfortable and also look good. I have few pairs because I do a lot of yoga, but these became instantly my favorite!'
