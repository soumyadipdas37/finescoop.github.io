Jet-skiers got a thrill when a playful dolphin leapt out of the water to greet them - even shooting them a smile.

The friendly mammal seemed to relish the attention as he jumped 5ft through the air right in front of the onlookers on water crafts.

The common dolphin has been enchanting people on jet ski tours off Weymouth, Dorset, in recent weeks.

He has been given the name Danny and even has his own Facebook fan page with over 4,000 members.

Dan Bell, an instructor at Jurassic Jetski Tours, said: 'Danny knew we were out in the water.

'We got some amazing shots. He certainly isn't camera shy around us.'

Danny is said to enjoy the sensation of the jet of water from the high-speed crafts on his belly.
