Jordyn Woods often posts sultry selfies to her Instagram page as she models the latest clothing and jewelry trends.

But on Tuesday the former best friend of Kylie Jenner went a step further by wearing a revealing string bikini with her legs opened.

This comes just days after the 22-year-old star's nemesis Khloe Kardashian, who accused Jordyn of sleeping with her on/off basketball pro beau Tristan Thompson, uploaded two very steamy bikini shots.

Khloe sizzled in a skimpy black bikini from her Good American line in a set of new social media photos. 

Her toned frame was put on display in a pair of high waisted bottoms and an underwired bra top, accessorized with a belly chain. The mother of one's tanned skin was oiled up in the sunshine as she flashed sultry gazes to the camera.

Kardashian even upped the wow factor by emphasizing her ample assets in a snap where she pushed her breasts up with manicured hands.

In Woods' new post, she is showing off a very trim waistline in her triangle top with matching bottoms that had a black-and-white cow print pattern.

The Life Of Kylie star's long hair was worn down in tight curls as she added a floppy beige hat and gold hoop earrings.

The TV veteran sat on a wood paneled platform with a window guard rail behind her that led to a scenic background with mature trees and blue skies.

'Hello September, please be good to us,' said the former Keeping Up With The Kardashians guest star in her caption.

She also credited the Matte Collection for her swimwear.

Last week, Scott Disick let the cat out of the bag and confirmed Khloe  and Tristan rekindled their romance.

When Khloe, 36, took to Instagram to share the sultry bikini shots, Disick declared in the comments section that the 29-year-old NBA player 'is a lucky man.'

Wow: Khloe sizzled in a skimpy black bikini from her Good American line and the sexy shots led to lots of supportive comments but it was Scott's that made jaws drop

A rep for Khloe had 'no comment' when DailyMail.com asked about Scott's mention that the couple is back on.  

After a tumultuous on-again-off-again relationship, Khloe and Tristan had broken up for good following his 2019 cheating scandal with Woods. 

However, earlier this month People cited a source who said, 'She loves having him around. He has the best relationship with True, and he has been amazing to Khloe too. They are very much together and Khloe is beyond happy.'

The source added, 'They have been living in kind of a bubble and Khloe enjoys it.'

The insider claimed that not only was the reality star was back together with NBA player, but they went so far as to add that she was 'beyond happy' and hoped 'that Tristan has changed'. 

However, in response to those rumors, a rep for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star told Dailymail.com that the reports are 'not true'. 

 Scott's confirmation comes after Khloe denied recent rumors that she and Tristan were back together just a few weeks ago

Now, Scott's comment is appearing to tell a different story - clearly indicating that the co-parents are a romantic pair again. 

Khloe and the Cleveland Cavaliers player have had plenty of time to work on their issues recently. Thompson had actually been living with Khloe and True in Calabasas  during the coronavirus pandemic. 

The reality TV star recently gushed about how helpful Tristan has been while they have quarantined together with their daughter, and is appreciative of the extra support. 

'So many people don't understand it, but I lead with love and we put our child first,' she told People last month. 'If you have that mindset, everything else follows easily. We have a family together.' 

She added: 'Tristan and I needed that time to heal and I needed time to go through my emotions. But now he's literally one of my best friends.' 

The beginning: Tristan and Khloe first went public with their romance in September 2016; In December 2017 she announced her pregnancy and moved to Cleveland to be with her beau (Pictured in 2018)

It's been a long road for the celebrity couple. Tristan and Khloe first went public with their romance in September 2016 and she finalized her divorce from ex-husband Lamar Odom.

All seemed well in December 2017 when Khloe announced the happy news that she was pregnant and moved to Cleveland to be with her beau. 

However, two days before she gave birth to her True in April of 2018, photos emerged of Tristan getting close to a mystery woman at a New York nightclub and old surveillance footage also surfaced showing him getting affectionate with two women at a hookah lounge in Washington, D.C.

The Cleveland Cavaliers player was hit by a further five claims of infidelity during Khloe's pregnancy.

While the pair worked on the relationship for the next nine months, things became messy once again in February 2019, when Tristan was caught out kissing sister Kylie Jenner's now former best friend, Jordyn Woods, at a house party. 

DailyMailTV revealed at the time that in addition to the Jordyn incident, Tristan was seen sneaking two women into a bedroom at a late night 'singles' party on Valentine's Day. He was still with Khloe at the time.
