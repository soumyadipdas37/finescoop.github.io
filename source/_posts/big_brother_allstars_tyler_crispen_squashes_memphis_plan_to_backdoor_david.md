Tyler Crispen won the golden power of the veto on Wednesday's episode of Big Brother All-Stars and used it to keep Kevin Campbell and Da'Vonne Rogers on the block.

In doing so, the 23-year-old jewelry company owner ignored Head of Household Memphis Garrett's larger plan to backdoor David Alexander, 30.

'I've decided not to use the power of veto,' Tyler said at the veto meeting, after he'd made Da'Vonne, 32, and Kevin, 40, plead to be taken off the block for the week.

Da'Vonne looked at her former ally with jaded eyes, as Kevin sunk into his chair.

'Memphis, I know you always want to be the alpha, but I'm nobody's beta,' Tyler crowed in a confessional, certain he was right about what needed to happen in the house.

When the episode began, Memphis, 37, had just nominated Kevin and Da'Vonne for elimination—but he made it clear to his alliance that he wanted to backdoor David.

Memphis was a member of The Committee, a group that included Tyler, Cody Calafiore, 29, Nicle Franzel, 28, Daniele Donato, 33, and Christmas Abbott, 35.

Da'Vonne had a feeling Memphis was going after David, and was fine with it, observing that David had tried to sabotage her game all season.

'We just gotta figure out how to survive this week,' she told Kevin, whom she had saved from the block in a previous week's veto. 'There's gotta be a way we can both stay in this house.'

Moved by Da'Vonne's support, Kevin decided to open up to her.

'There's really only one winner in this game, but I feel like finding a friend like you… you have made my dreams come true,' he said.

'You're gonna make me cry,' Da'Vonne said, growing emotional and covering her face.

'I remember watching you and thinking, 'She's gonna be an All-Star,' Kevin recalled. 'And I'm playing with you on an All-Star season. And then I became friends with you.'

'Ever since I watched your season, I said, 'If we ever met, he would be my best friend,' Da'Vonne returned. 'And then, I met you. And you became my best friend. I love you.'

The two of them joined Memphis for the week's veto competition, where he picked Tyler to compete and they both drew the all-important Houseguest's Choice button.

Da'Vonne chose Nicole to take part in the game, while Kevin asked Daniele to join.

To David, those decisions sent a clear message: They did not trust him any longer.

In a secret meeting, Memphis shared his plan with Dani, Tyler and Nicole.

'Listen to me right now,' he said. 'I'm back-dooring David, and all of you are gonna throw the comp.'

Tyler wasn't thrilled with that idea, calling David an 'island' who posed no threat to anyone, while Da'Vonne and Kevin formed 'a power duo.'

As he thought about what to do, BB's famed Zingbot showed up to roast the houseguests.

The robot was dressed in a fringed vest like Joe Exotic from Netflix's Tiger King documentary, and called himself 'Tiger Zing.'

He proceeded to unleash some whoppers on the cast.

'I can't believe I'm here on Big Brother All-Stars,' the robot began. 'And frankly, I can't believe you're here either, David.'

Zingbot then made fun of Cody's IQ, Dani's age, Nicole's whininess, and Christmas' stress levels, compared Memphis to poop, and teased Enzo Palumbo, 42, about being called 'Meow-Meow.'

'Kevin, I came up with a great nickname that captures you perfectly and has a great ring to it,' Zingbot continued. 'Bo-ring!'

'Da'Vonne, you've done three seasons of Big Brother, and two seasons of The Challenge,' it cracked. 'Which reality show do you plan to lose next?'

The houseguests barely had time to think about Zingbot's jibes, as he subsequently introduced the veto competition itself.

Boring: 'Kevin, I came up with a great nickname that captures you perfectly and has a great ring to it,' Zingbot continued. 'Bo-ring!'

Veto competition: The houseguests barely had time to think about Zingbot's jibes, as he subsequently introduced the veto competition itself

Each of the six competitors had to race through Zingbot's 'tiger sanctuary,' a giant maze in which they needed to find three stuffed tigers, then place each one in designated cages.

Tyler ignored Memphis' stated plan and won with the fastest time, earning the power of veto.

Memphis told Da'Vonne and Kevin he was shocked Tyler had gone rogue, and detailed how he tried to save them.

In a subsequent conversation, Tyler pointed out to Memphis that it would be better for their alliance to save David, who was an unthreatening lone wolf.

He told Memphis he sensed Da'Vonne and Kevin had a discrete alliance with Dani and Nicole.

'There might be some sketchy s*** going on, man,' Tyler offered, as Memphis began to wonder if he'd had the whole thing wrong.

In a confessional, the HoH said, 'Even though my plan was to backdoor David this week, the information Tyler is giving me is very interesting. If Dani and Nicole are working side deals, knocking out one of their allies might make sense, 'cause David doesn't have anyone.'

At the veto meeting, Tyler gave both Da'Vonne and Kevin a chance to explain why they should be taken off the block—but they both knew it was a formality.

'I'm gonna cut the s***,' Da'Vonne told Tyler when it was her turn. 'This plan has been in motion for a while… I'm not gonna ask you to use the veto. I know you're not gonna use it. At this point, whatever is gonna happen is gonna happen. Let it ride.'

As predicted, Tyler did not use the veto. Da'Vonne and Kevin remained on the block.

Big Brother All-Stars returns Thursday on CBS.
