A man was allegedly caught on camera pushing a shopping trolley with his friend inside into the path of a group of cyclists travelling at almost 50km/hour.

CCTV footage captured at a Caltex service station in Dee Why, on Sydney's northern beaches, shows several of the 40 riders tumble to the ground. 

Jack Maartensz, 26, faced Manly Local Court on Tuesday accused of deliberately mowing down the cyclists in the early hours of March 7 on Pittwater Road, Manly Daily reported.

He has pleaded guilty to two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of intentionally or recklessly destroy or damage property. 

But the 26-year-old has denied his actions were deliberate and is fighting a charge of intentionally throw object at vehicle. 

The court heard Maartensz had allegedly been drinking for 12 hours in the lead up to the moment caught on camera at about 5.40am.

Maartensz admitted the man depicted on tape was him but claimed he was simply giving his friend Brad Riddington a ride when he lost control of the trolley.

He said he tried to pull the trolley back as it slipped down the service station driveway - but it was too late.   

Maartensz told the court he had no idea the cyclists were travelling towards them until the trolley hit them.  

His friend who was inside the trolley said he hadn't noticed until the cyclists were on top of him. 

The cyclists from Manly Warringah Cycling Club were using lights while travelling at 42km/hour along the busy road before sunrise.

Their lights picked up something moving towards them on the left hand side but it was too late to take action.

Cyclist Chris Taylor told the court the alleged actions did not appear to be an accident. 

'He was head down, with the trolley and he was running at us,' Mr Taylor said.

'We were yelling ''no, no, no,''. He just kept his head down and ploughed into us.'  

Prosecutor Sgt Chris O'Brien agreed the CCTV footage proved the alleged actions appeared deliberate.

The case will return to court on December 4.
