Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez are anteing up in their bid for the New York Mets.

The 51-year-old beauty and three-time baseball MVP, 45, have pledged that she would be in control of the franchise - making her baseball's first female Latina owner - and that they would pay $100 million to charity if the team didn't win the World Series in 10 years or less.

'It ain’t over until it is over,' the Hustlers star told the New York Post on Tuesday, quoting late baseball icon Yogi Berra. 'We are New Yorkers and we are not going to give up. We feel we have the best bid for the sport, the team and the city.'

The latest: Jennifer Lopez, 51, and Alex Rodriguez, 45, have pledged that she would be in control of the NY Mets franchise - making her baseball's first female Latina owner - and that they would pay $100 million to charity if the team didn't win the World Series in 10 years or less, if their bid for the team was a winner. They were snapped Tuesday in NYC 

'I would be the control person,' the Love Don’t Cost a Thing artist said of the planned arrangement with the former MLB shortstop if they were to buy the baseball club from the Wilpons/Katz group that's currently in control.

The multitalented entertainer and Rodriguez, an alum of the New York Yankees, Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners, told the publication that their bid was comparable to Steve Cohen's $2.35 billion bid.

Rodriguez, a 14-time All Star on the diamond, said he and Lopez would like a payroll around $225 million to position the team to 'compete for a World Series championship every year,' as 'that is what New York fans deserve.'

Insiders told the paper that Cohen is likely to compete his purchase of the team and that tax figures are the only thing stalling completion of the purchase.

Competitive: The multitalented entertainer and Rodriguez,who have been quarantining together, told the publication that their bid was comparable to Steve Cohen's $2.35 billion bid 

He needs at least 23 of 30 MB voters to vote in his favor amid sexual discrimination and insider trading entanglements.  

Walmart exec Marc Lore, an investor in the J.Lo/A-Rod group, said that 'it would be a really big win for racial and gender equality in this country and the world' if their side were to prevail.

'This is a big moment in the history of baseball and the Mets to have the first Latina owner of a Major League Baseball franchise, Lore said. 'I was impressed by how passionate and mission-oriented both Alex and Jennifer are and the high level of integrity and core values that they displayed throughout this entire process.' 

Lopez opened up last month about their efforts to try and buy the storied baseball franchise
