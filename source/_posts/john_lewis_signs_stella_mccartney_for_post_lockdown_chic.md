John Lewis will sell more pyjamas, comfortable clothes and high-end sportswear from Stella McCartney in a bid to 'modernise' its brands. 

The department store chain is adding 30 labels to jump on lockdown trends for more casual clothing to wear at home. The autumn range will include Calvin Klein, Fat Face and Sosandar. It will press ahead with a group of athleisure brands, which have seen 'sales exceed expectations'.

John Lewis has also expanded its beauty range with items such as anti-ageing face massagers and Olaplex luxury hair treatments. 

Bosses hope they will appeal to the army of 'beauty hobbyists', who have used skincare and make-up as a way to relax during the lockdown. 

Fashion director Christine Kasoulis said the ranges were part of 'the work we're doing to modernise' the brand. 

She added: 'We're introducing new brands that we feel really resonate with the needs of our customers whether that's loungewear that's smart enough for a Zoom call or skincare products that enhance their natural complexion.'
