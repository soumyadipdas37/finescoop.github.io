 A jealous husband was found with a stash of eight guns after shooting his wife's secret lover, a court heard.

Andrew Jones, 53, is accused of murdering Michael O'Leary, 55, after luring him into a trap over his affair with wife.

Businessman Jones told police he became 'upset' after finding his wife's secret phone that she used to send intimate messages to Mr O'Leary.

 According to claims made in Swansea Crown Court, Jones' wife Rhianon, 51, boasted to her husband that she enjoyed sex with her secret lover more than with him.

Rhianon's husband later shot Mr O'Leary by accident in a bitter confrontation over the affair, the court was told.

 A court heard police found bullet casings at the farm where Jones allegedly used a forklift truck to move Mr O'Leary's body.

The bullets were believed to be from a Colt.22 rifle found at the home address of Jones.

A locked gun cabinet in the home also contained a 303 Lee-Enfield rifle, a 22 Luger rifle with suppressor, a.308 Armalite rifle with suppressor and a.233 Southern Gun rifle.

Jones also owned three shotguns - a 12-bore Mossberg shotgun, a 12-bore Mossberg pump-action shotgun and a 12-bore Beretta over and under shotgun.

The court heard all of the weapons had firearms certificates.

Prosecutor William Hughes QC said: 'Mike O'Leary was lured to this location expecting a private meeting with Rhianon Jones. Instead he was met by this defendant who was armed with a powerful rifle which he used to deliberately shoot him dead.

'Steps were subsequently taken to hide and cover up his crimes - not in panic but a clear and calculated approach.'

He added: 'This was a carefully planned and well thought-out murder far from an accident.'

Members of the jury were taken to Cyncoed Farm in Cwmfrwdd, and the home address in nearby Carmarthen.

The jury heard Mr O'Leary's DNA was found on pieces of bloodstained clothing at the address.

Jones allegedly found a second hidden phone belonging to wife Rhianon, 51, under a pile of clothes.

Mr O'Leary's number had been listed under a nickname in the address book.

 Jones told police: 'I was upset about the sex stuff.

'He had done stuff with her that we had done and she enjoyed it more with him.'

Jones, of Bronwydd, Carmarthen denies murder.

The trial at Swansea Crown Court continues.
