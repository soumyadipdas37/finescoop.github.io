She penned: 'It's the details for mee I warned y'all about this week.. it's my golden year! 23 on the 23rd ♥️ #jordynyear #heirjordyn.'

Jordyn's birthday posts come after it was revealed that Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be ending after 14 years.

The model's reputation as one of the Kardashian/Jenner family's closest friends and confidantes was destroyed when it emerged she had shared a kiss with Khloe's on-off boyfriend Tristan Thompson. They share daughter True, two.

In season 16 of KUWTK, the family learning about Tristan allegedly hooking up with Kylie Jenner's then-best friend Jordyn was all caught on camera.

After choosing to work on her relationship with Tristan following a different cheating scandal not involving Jordyn while she was pregnant, Khloe eventually decided to split from the athlete and father of her daughter. 

In 2019, during a sit down with Jada Pinkett Smith for Red Table Talk on Facebook, Jordyn admitted to kissing Tristan but said it was not 'intimate.'

The then 21-year-old broke down in tears, saying she is 'no homewrecker' and she didn't break them up.  

Shock announcement: Jordyn's birthday posts come after it was revealed that Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be ending after 14 years 

In an Instagram message posted earlier this month, Kim, 39, revealed KUWTK was ending, she said: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians. 

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.

Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.  

'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.

'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'
