Jack Bearne scored twice as Liverpool Under 23s beat their Manchester United counterparts 5-3.

Leighton Clarkson gave Liverpool an early lead as he finished adroitly after combining well with Bearne.   

Ben Woodburn proceeded to make it 2-0, with his effort deflecting in off Di'Shon Bernard. 

Liverpool Under 23s won 5-3 against Manchester United U23s in an enthralling encounter 

Bearne then scored his first goal of the game after he was teed up by Woodburn. 

Anthony Elanga got a goal back for United but Liverpool pushed on, with Bearne scoring again before Luis Longstaff got in on the act.

Both sides were reduced to 10 men in the 61st minute, with Clarkson dismissed for a rash challenge and United's Shola Shoretire also seeing red for his reaction as he shoved Clarkson.
