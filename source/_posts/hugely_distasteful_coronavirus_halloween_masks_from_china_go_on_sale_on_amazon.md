'Hugely distasteful' coronavirus Halloween masks which are made in China are being listed for sale on Amazon's UK website.

The latex masks - some of which are being sold at up to £30 - are being listed on the online marketplace by a number of Chinese-based sellers.

The full-face masks resemble an illustration of the SARS-CoV-2019 virus - but with creepy eyes and a mouth.

The 'non-toxic' masks are being marketed as suitable for adults and teenagers - with one seller claiming the mask will leave 'an amazing and lasting impression'.

It comes after the worldwide death toll for the virus, which is thought to have first transferred to humans in the Chinese city of Wuhan, this week reached one million people.

The masks have been branded 'hugely distasteful' by one parenting group, while Amazon has vowed to remove the listings from its website.

'This will add more happy and active atmosphere to you.'

The masks have attracted criticism by Rachel Power Rachel Power, Chief Executive of the Patients Association.

Plague doctors costumes are selling out at fancy dress stores as they are tipped to be one of the most popular Halloween costumes this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Medieval plague doctor outfits with long black robes, black tops hats, gloves and the distinctive beak masks are already sold out on some online stores.

The costumes were worn by doctors treating patients during the epidemics of bubonic plague that swept across western Europe.

Plague doctors often wore a head-to-toe leather or wax coat and a beak mask, which would be stuffed with sweet smelling herbs, dried flowers or a vinegar sponge to ward off the disease.

They also carried a rod to poke or fend off victims.

Amazon has a plague doctors mask, black top hat, black hooded cape, black gloves and a cane for £27.99 and even a children's version, complete with blood splatters on the arm for £15.99. 

Many people have taken to Twitter to reveal that they are wearing plague doctor costumes for Halloween this year.

Raphael Mejia wrote: 'Plague doctor is gonna be my Halloween costume.'

Maria added: 'The amount of plague doctors we're gonna see this Halloween.'

 

She told The Sun: 'These masks show a terrible lapse of judgement by the manufacturers and sellers, and I hope they will be removed from sale quickly.

'I've no doubt the great majority of people will find them hugely distasteful, and I can't imagine that many people would wish to wear one.'  

An Amazon spokesperson told MailOnline: 'All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.

'These products are being removed.'

Britain today recorded 7,108 more coronavirus cases and another 71 deaths — including a three-month high of seven in Scotland.

Daily infections are up 15 per cent on last Wednesday's 6,178 and almost 80 per cent higher than on Wednesday two weeks ago.

But Britain's infections are a far-cry from what they were during the darkest days of the crisis in March and April, when at least 100,000 people were becoming infected every day.

The Department of Health data also adds to evidence that the death count is now slowly starting to climb after weeks of surging infections.

For comparison, the number of victims announced today is almost double that of last Wednesday (37) and more than triple the figure a fortnight ago (20).

There have been more than 40,000 coronavirus related deaths in the UK so far. 

A medium has blasted Poundland as being 'utterly irresponsible' for flogging ouija boards for Halloween.

Clairvoyant Julie Tetley claims the devices can 'destroy people's lives' and 'spirits can cause suicides'.

She fears she will be 'busy in the next couple of months' dealing with the fall-out from people dabbling in the dark arts by inadvertently summoning sinister spirits using the £1 prop.

The 64-year-old medium was horrified to discover the boards, a firm favourite in horror movies, were being sold as a Halloween decoration in the Scarborough branch of the store.

Although Julie accepts the board is merely a tool, she says it encourages people to 'open up their energies' and communicate with spirits - some more 'sinister' than others.

She claimed people should leave the so-called 'game' well alone as she believes the evil spirits can lead to suicides among those they 'attach' to.

Poundland is selling its Spirit Board for £1 nationwide as part of its 'Creepy Town' Halloween displays. 

Sale of the product is restricted to over 18s and the product is labelled 'for adults only'.

Julie, from Scarborough, said: 'It's totally and utterly irresponsible for Poundland to be selling this, it's horrendous.

'Children will buy them, they just want fun. They see it on TV, they don't understand what they're doing, it can destroy their lives in every way.

'It can bring negative influences around you all the time. They need to know the intent of using these boards is to speak to the spirit.



'Sometimes people say 'this board doesn't work, it hasn't moved' but they've already opened up that channel to spirits, then they'll know about it later.'

A medium all her life, Julie said that those untrained in energies may find themselves at the mercy of 'unscrupulous' characters looking to take advantage of them.

Julie said: 'You get people who were unscrupulous, people who would take advantage and people who were very very sinister here and you get the same in spirits.

'Their personality is still who they are [in spirit form].

'If a darker energy attaches itself to someone who's naive they can just take advantage - they can cause stress and worry.

'They'll give them information that's right then all of a sudden this board will spell out something like there's going to be a fatal accident or one of your parents is going to be killed.

'They'll say something horrendous and have that person worried because the other things they've given have been true.

'It can cause a lot of stress, the spirit can start to manipulate through their mind - giving them bad thoughts and giving them thoughts of suicidal tendencies.

'It can almost cause suicide in the long-term so it's very, very dangerous.'

A Poundland spokesman said: 'Poundland is the home for Halloween and the Spirit Board is part of this year's extensive Halloween Decoration range.

'We understand the spirits shook in disbelief when they were told it was only £1. Just wait until people see the Voodoo dolls.'
