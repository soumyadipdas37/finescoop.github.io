Cardi B, 27, filed for divorce from her husband Offset, 28, this week after three years of marriage.

The couple's relationship has been dogged by rampant rumors of infidelity on Offset's part, but insiders close to Cardi claim there is 'no baby on the way' with another woman.

Sources dubbed the story 'super-false' and telling Page Six that the WAP star is trying to keep her split 'super amicable' on Thursday.

'There is no other child. No baby is on the way. That rumor is super false. Cardi is thinking of her child and wants everything to be amicable. She's evolved over the years and continues to,' the insider told Page Six.

The source went on to add that, in fact, Cardi is working hard to make things as cordial as possible with her soon-to-be ex, particularly when it comes to their daughter Kulture. 

In her initial divorce filing, the Bodak Yellow hitmaker had requested primary physical and legal custody of the two-year-old as well as child support.

Later, however, she decided to seek a more equitable seek a joint custody agreement with the Migos rapper, according to TMZ.

It seems that Cardi's lawyer was the one who had moved forward with the more aggressive approach and the New York native wasn't even aware of the specifics. 

'She went back to have the petition amended because she wasn't aware that it read "primary custody,"' an insider added to Page Six.

'She wants them both to have custody and to co-parent,' they continued. 'She's not requesting spousal support or child support. She wants everything to be super amicable.

The original petition did request child support from Offset, but TMZ reported that the amendment will exclude that language, as Cardi is making plenty of money on her own.

The rapper also initially requested that Offset cover all of her attorney fees and legal costs throughout the divorce proceedings. It's unclear, however, if she still wants her soon-to-be ex to pay up.  

Cardi's divorce filings indicate that she and Offset have been living separately for some time. 

The two apparently don't have a prenuptial agreement, so Cardi is requesting that all assets earned during their marriage be split, as well as any debts accrued during that time. 

Offset, who's real name is Kiari Kendrell Cephus, has three children with other women: Kalea Marie Cephus, Kody Cephus and Jordan Cephus. 

'She wants them both to have custody and to co-parent,' the source continued. 'She's not requesting spousal support or child support. She wants everything to be super amicable.' 

Although Cardi hasn't spoken publicly about her divorce yet, her husband's infidelity appears to have been the breaking point for the female rapper.

While the new Page Six article made mention that there was 'no baby' with another woman, the source didn't say there was no infidelity. 

A source told People Tuesday: 'Offset has pretty much cheated the entire time but Cardi looked the other way because of the baby. She also didn't want to be embarrassed. But she's had enough.' 

In the September issue of Elle, Cardi spoke about her relationship and said her marriage with Offset has 'a lot of drama.'

'There's always rumors about me and my husband, and I feel like people would rather start rumors because they want me to be heartbroken,' she said.

'They want me to be hurt. I do know that my relationship has a lot of drama and everything. But there's a lot of love, there's a lot of passion, there's a lot of trust, there's a big friendship. It's always us against the world.' 

The WAP rapper filed documents in Superior Court, Fulton County, Georgia on Tuesday under her real name — Belcalis Almanzar — as part of a divorce petition, according to TMZ.

She and Offset (real name: Kiari Cephus) married in a secret ceremony in 2017 and share two-year-old daughter Kulture. 

Divorce: Cardi originally requested 'primary physical custody as well as legal custody' of Kulture as well as child support and says the marriage is 'irretrievably broken' (the couple are pictured at their daughter's second birthday party)

The court documents state that 'there are no prospects for a reconciliation' and that the relationship is 'irretrievably broken.'

However, the documents add that Cardi hopes the divorce 'will be settled by agreement of the parties', according to E! News.  

Cardi previously accused Offset of infidelity in 2018 just five months after the birth of their daughter. 

After she declared they 'grew out of love' and were 'not together anymore, Offset publicly pleaded with her to give him another chance.

In a lengthy post on his Instagram, he wrote: 'We're going through a lot of things right now, a lot of things in the media. I want to apologize to you Cardi. I embarrassed you. I made you go crazy.'

He went on: 'I was partaking in activity that I shouldn't have been partaking in, and I apologize. You know what I'm saying? For breaking your heart, for breaking our promise, for breaking God's promise and being a selfish, messed up husband.'

He added: 'I'm trying to be a better person..... I apologize to you Cardi. I love you.' 

The Georgia-born rapper was allegedly also involved in a sex tape scandal with another woman in 2017. Cardi and Offset did reconcile again, getting back together in 2019.

Making her own rules: Responding to her critics, Cardi explained in an interview with Cosmopolitan published in April 2019 that she didn't feel she had to answer to anyone about her personal life (Pictured in January)

Responding to her critics, Cardi explained in an interview with Cosmopolitan published in April 2019 that she didn't feel she had to answer to anyone about her personal life. 

'I know I look good, I know I'm rich, I know I'm talented,' she told the magazine. 'I know I could get any man I want — any basketball player, football player. But I want to work out my s— with my man, and I don't got to explain why.'

She added: 'I'm not your property. This is my life … I'm going to take my time, and I'm going to decide on my decision. It's not right, what he f***ing did — but people don't know what I did, 'cause I ain't no angel.'  

And earlier this year, in the January issue of Vogue, Cardi once again defended her decision to stay with Offset despite his cheating. 

'When me and my husband got into our issues—you know, he cheated and everything—and I decided to stay with him and work together with him, a lot of people were so mad at me,' she told Vogue. 'A lot of women felt disappointed in me.'

But, she explained: 'If you love somebody and you stop being with them, and you're depressed and social media is telling you not to talk to that person because he cheated, you're not really happy on the inside until you have the conversation.'
