Will Forte has decided to part with his longtime home in Santa Monica's Ocean Park neighborhood after 18-years.

And he stands to make a nice profit if he can get a buyer near the asking price. 

The 50-year-old actor and comedian bought the three bedroom and two bath bungalow in 2002 for $840,000, but just listed it on the market for $2.45 million, according to Variety.

Will Forte is selling his 1,936 square feet home in Santa Monica's Ocean Park neighborhood, which just a few blocks away from the scenic beaches of Santa Monica

Nice investment: The Last Man On Earth creator and star bought the bungalow in 2002 for $840,000, but just listed it on the market for $2.45 million

Dating back to the 1910s, the 1,936 square feet residence is located just a few blocks away from the scenic beaches of Santa Monica, and comes complete with a gorgeous view of the ocean from the second floor.

The master bedroom has an enjoining vintage-style bathroom and a spacious walk-in closet. 

The main living area features a brick fireplace that sits between glass-doored bookcases and opens up to a light-infused kitchen. 

The three bedroom and two bathroom home dates back to the 1910s

Gorgeous French doors stand out in both the living room and the neighboring dining room.

No doubt the creator and star of The Last Man On Earth has enjoyed the outdoor spaces, with a front patio that opens both to the kitchen and main living areas and a private sundeck in the back.  

In addition to the spacious front porch, there's a fenced deck area that’s outside the kitchen, and one of the guest bedrooms atop a single-car garage.
