The couple announced their engagement in April with a sweet Instagram post, Lachy writing: 'On Thursday night, Dana asked me to marry her at home under a fairy light sky and a very excited little boy in a beautiful bow tie.' 

In the photo, Lachlan was pictured cuddling up to Dana and Dana's son Jasper, four, inside a bedroom festooned with fairy lights.

Meanwhile, Dana shared a post on her Instagram announcing the news and revealing that Lachlan had actually proposed a month earlier. 

'At the end of our summer holidays, I walked into the most beautiful surprise - a room filled with the most incredible flowers and Lachy singing at his piano and then asking me to marry him. It was such a surprise and so special. Our faces say it all,' she wrote next to a selfie of the couple.   

'It was something very meaningful for us to both have the opportunity to propose to one another, each in our own way,' she continued.

The mother-of-one, who is a senior dancer for The Australian Ballet, also described the moment she met Lachlan on the set of The Wiggles television show in early December 2018. 

'Lachy and I just had a really beautiful connection straight away. It was between us, but after the fact quite a few people noticed,' she said.

Lachlan separated from his Wiggles bandmate Emma Watkins (a.k.a. The Yellow Wiggle) in August 2018, after two years of marriage. 

He confirmed his romance with Dana in October 2019 when he shared a selfie of the pair to Instagram. 

On New Year's Day, Lachlan revealed that he'd met Dana's son Jasper, four, who she shares with her photographer ex-husband, Michael Kai.

Meanwhile, Lachlan and his ex-wife Emma continue to be on good terms, despite their very public divorce. 

Speaking to Who in August last year Emma said: 'We are the best of friends and we were always meant to be. We were close before we started dating and now we've come full circle!' 

Meanwhile, Emma is dating The Wiggles' musician Oliver Brian, 32.
