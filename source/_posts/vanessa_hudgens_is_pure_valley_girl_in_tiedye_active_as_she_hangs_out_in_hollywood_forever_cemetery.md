Vanessa Hudgens has been making the most of her summer, recently returning from a tropical getaway, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

And the former Disney star is now embracing her spooky side, as Halloween inches closer in Hollywood.

She channeled her inner Valley girl Friday in skintight activewear, as she met up with pal GG Magree for a workout, some lunch and a casual hang in Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

The 31-year-old showed off her taut midriff and toned legs in some blue and white tie-dye bike shorts with a matching sports bra, layered under a black sports bra.

She finished the look with some then frameless sunglasses, a green face mask, black leather choker, layers of silver jewelry and some chunky white platform sneakers.

Hudgens wore her thick wavy hair up in a black scrunchy, while carrying a black belt bag over her shoulder and flashing her yellow manicure. 

She later showed off the look in some black-and-white photos, completed with an old Hollywood headscarf, as she posed in the star-studded cemetery.

Hudgens took to her Instagram Story on Monday with some videos from her mask-free workout at the elite celeb-favorite gym Dogpound with the Australian DJ and trainer Julia Brown.

She did some weighted pelvic lists before joining Magree on a balance trainer and doing a suggestive dance together with resistance bands.  

After working up a sweat at the West Hollywood gym, they headed over to Zinqué for a sunny outdoor lunch.

Tropical getaway: She returned last month from vacation with friends to Turks and Caicos, shortly after international travel resumed, amid the global pandemic

Hudgens' time in the gym has paid off, as her bikini body has recent earned likes from Yankees outfielder Giancarlo Stanton and Philadelphia 76ers point guard/Kendall Jenner's ex Ben Simmons.

She returned last month from vacation with friends to Turks and Caicos, shortly after international travel resumed, amid the global pandemic.  

It came after she posted a particularly cavalier video statement regarding the lockdown, back in March.

She said on her Instagram story at the time: 'Even if everybody gets it, like yeah, people are going to die which is terrible, but inevitable?'

Hudgens later apologized: 'It's a crazy time, it's a crazy, crazy time and I am at home and in lockdown and that's what I hope you guys are doing too. Yeah I don't take this situation lightly, by any means, I am home.'
