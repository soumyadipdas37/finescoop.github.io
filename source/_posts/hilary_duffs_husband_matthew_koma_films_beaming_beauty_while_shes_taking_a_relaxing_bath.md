Hilary Duff is having a nice birthday month.

The 32-year-old star, who turns 33 on September 28, beamed as she relaxed taking a bath in an Instagram clip Wednesday filmed by her husband Matthew Koma, 33.

The Houston native beamed as she relaxed with a small silver party hat on, with her blonde locks up in a bun.

Good clean fun:  Hilary Duff, who turns 33 on September 28, beamed as she relaxed taking a bath in an Instagram clip Wednesday filmed by her husband Matthew Koma, 33 

Koma, a New York native, tagged the Younger actress in the post with the tag with the phrase wife.

Earlier this week, Koma took to Instagram to show off a new tattoo he got of the name 'Hilary' on the left side of his rear end.

Koma captioned the shot, 'Good luck winning a fight with your wife when her name’s tattooed on your butt cheek,' to which Duff said, 'Finest tiniest booty around.'

Koma earlier this month displayed a tattoo he was inked with of a troll on the backside of his thigh.

He said, 'When your daughter’s favorite movie is Trolls and your best friend is the voice of Gristle, you have @jaynawon tattoo this on you. Thanks for the Bergen. (Koma's pal Christopher Mintz-Plasse provided the voice of King Gristle in 2016's Trolls.)

The Lizzie McGuire alum and the music professional tied the knot in December 2019 in Los Angeles, with Duff's friend and co-star Molly Bernard presiding over the ceremony.

The Younger star and the Winnetka Bowling League artist, who have been linked since January of 2017, are parents to one-year-old daughter Banks Violet. Duff is also mom to eight-year-son Luca from her past marriage to Mike Comrie, who she split with in February of 2015.
