With her caramel tresses styled in loose waves over her shoulders, Holly added glam to her look with full eyelashes and a slick of nude lip gloss.

The outing comes after Holly shared a snap of herself in front of a bridal boutique to her Instagram page in August. 

She wrote: 'Today I said yes to the dress. It's been one of the most emotional days of my life for so many reasons. This symbolised more than just a dress for me. 

'It marks the end of a decade worth of sadness, heartbreak, trolling, lack of self worth and self respect.'  

Holly propelled to fame on Geordie Shore back in 2011 and went on to spend thousands of pounds on surgery after being trolled over her looks. She found herself in a series of toxic relationships due to her lack of self confidence.

She explained: 'I was never what people would call a 'worldie'. But today I felt so much more than that. 

'I felt beautiful. Not just because of my appearance, but because of who I am and who I have become.

'I believed the world when they told me No1 would ever want to marry someone like me.

'I believed the ex's who said no man would ever accept my past. But here I am, loved, wanted and respected every single day of my life. And the truth is I deserve every last bit of it.

'Thank you to the amazing women at @hummingbirdbridalstudio you have made all of my dreams come true' (sic). 

Earlier this year Holly and Jacob flew out to Ibiza to finalise their wedding plans. 

The television star was set to secure her dream wedding venue in Ibiza this Spring, before coronavirus but a stop to her travel plans.

In December, Holly revealed she had postponed her wedding, admitting she had become overwhelmed with the pressure of planning so decided to 'put it off a little bit'.

Jacob proposed during a sunset dinner date at the chic Cotton Beach Club in Ibiza on their second anniversary in June 2019.
