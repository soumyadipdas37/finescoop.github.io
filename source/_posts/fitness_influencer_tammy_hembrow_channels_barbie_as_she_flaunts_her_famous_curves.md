She's created a fitness empire worth millions. 

And on Thursday, Tammy Hembrow showed off her money-making curves.

The 26-year-old fitness influencer shared a series of Barbie-inspired photos on Instagram, working her angles for the camera. 

Barbie girl! Fitness influencer Tammy Hembrow left nothing to the imagination on Thursday as she flaunted her famous backside in VERY revealing booty shorts 

Tammy opted for a revealing pink and white ensemble for the impromptu photo shoot, posing in a pair of figure-hugging pink hotpants. 

She also wore a matching pink crop top, which showed off her taut stomach and ample bust.

Tammy rounded out her ensemble with a pair of white sneakers and donned a cropped white cardigan over her top.

Her long blonde hair was styled in two high pigtails, and she carried a small pink Prada handbag in the crook of her elbow.

Think pink! Tammy opted for a revealing pink and white ensemble for the impromptu photo shoot, posing in a pair of figure-hugging pink hotpants. She also wore a matching pink crop top, which showed off her taut stomach and ample bust 

The savvy businesswoman revealed the ensemble had come from the latest collection of her activewear line, Saski Collection.

In a recently unearthed YouTube Q&A, Tammy confessed to getting breast implants shortly after the birth of her daughter, Saskia, three.

'I got my boobs done after I had Sass, after I stopped breastfeeding her actually,' she explained.

'I just think it sucked the life out of my boobs. They were just little saggy pieces of skin after.'   

In the past, Tammy has repeatedly denied speculation she's undergone a Brazilian butt lift in order to attain her shapely derrière. 

The beauty has long been the subject of surgery rumours, however she has seldom spoken about it.
