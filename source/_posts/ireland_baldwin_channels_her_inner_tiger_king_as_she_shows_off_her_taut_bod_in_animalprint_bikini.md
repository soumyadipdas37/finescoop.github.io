Ireland Baldwin celebrated six years without eating disorders last month.

And the model/actress has long since embraced self-love and body positivity, setting an example for her 621k Instagram followers.

She channeled her inner Tiger King and showed off her taut bod Sunday, as she took to Instagram in a sizzling cheetah-print two-piece bikini, featuring criss-crossed straps over her tight tummy.

The 24-year-old gave a nod to pop culture phenomenon Carole Baskin in the caption, writing: 'Killed her. Hus-band. Whacked him.'

She also shared some sweet snaps to her Instagram Story with boyfriend Corey Harper, 25, as they took a dip in her pool. 

Ireland later posted a photo from a recent beach outing, revealing she was on her period at the time.

She wrote: 'I get really bloated in my face, stomach and legs BAD. This was two days ago!! On my period. 7 pounds of water weight. Still went to the beach because I'm a bad b**** and awwwwwnn give no f***.'

Baldwin celebrated a milestone last month on Instagram, announcing in a video: 'Hi guys. I also wanted to announce that today is the 15th of August.

'And today marks six years that I have been free of anorexia and bulimia and all of my other food compulsion and eating disorders that I have struggled through for many years.' 

She revealed in August of 2018 that she had struggled with eating disorders, opening up on Instagram about a week after what would have been the fourth anniversary. 

The daughter of Alec Baldwin, 62, and Kim Basinger, 66, wrote: 'I battled with many eating disorders and body issues as a younger girl and it took me a long time to find self love and acceptance!

'Trust me, all of that pain and destruction I inflicted on myself wasn’t worth it. Turning down so. Many. Sides. Of. Fries. Wasn’t worth it!!'

She continued: 'I would eat a meal or more like a bite and have to run to the nearest bathroom or find digestive pills or run until I couldn’t feel my legs right before bed.

'I used to read people’s comments when I first started modeling and anytime anyone told me I was too tall or too fat to have done a job, I would run on a treadmill for the entire duration of at least three episodes of Friday Night Lights that I had on box set.'  

Baldwin concluded: 'Love yourself!! You are beautiful!! Enjoy your food. Eat ice cream with your friends! Workout and eat healthy to take care of your mind and body but find your healthy balance! Life is too short.'

She also reportedly checked into Malibu's Soba Recovery Center back in 2015, dealing with some 'emotional trauma,' following her brief relationship with artist Angel Haze, 29.

A source told ET at the time: 'Ireland has been through some stressful and negative situations in her life recently and has taken the proactive approach to getting things back on track.

'Ireland has the full support of her family and friends who are extremely proud that she has taken matters into her own hands as the strong woman that she is.'
