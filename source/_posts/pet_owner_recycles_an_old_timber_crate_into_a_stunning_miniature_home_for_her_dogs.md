A pet owner has gone above and beyond to build the ultimate dream home for her dogs - complete with festoon lights, water tank, solar lamps and a grassy patio.

The Australian woman transformed an old timber crate into a miniature property for her 'fur babies' after she used budget items from Bunnings.

She recycled the crate by painting it with navy blue and white stripes, attached a steel roofing on top and decorated the exterior with stunning potted flowers.

The woman said the old crate was given to her from a friend but mentioned she had seen similar versions sold on online marketplaces

'Thought we would transform an old timber crate into this gorgeous doggie house for our fur babies, complete with planter boxes and festoon lighting,' she wrote in a Facebook group. 

'We used temp fence panels and one enclosure gate panel to make the enclosure, we sprayed them with black spray paint.'

The woman said the old crate was given to her from a friend but mentioned she had seen similar versions sold on online marketplaces.

She purchased the solar garden lights from $2 each, light up flowers, potted plants and fence panels from Bunnings.

The pet owner explained that the roof is attached to the crate so she can't 'lift up for cleaning' but there's another way she can access the space.

'[The roof] is fixed. However it's big enough to get inside if you needed too,' she said.

Her post has since been 'liked' more than 800 times, with dozens of people saying it's a great way to turn old crates into a 'beautiful palace' for their pets. 

'How cool is this and they have their own vertical garden. Amazing,' one woman said.

Another pet owner said: 'Super loved and spoilt. Amazing job. I'd pay for this at my place, while one added: 'Oh that's fab very creative... lucky dogs.'

Many insisted the woman's dogs are 'very lucky' while others described the home as the 'best thing I've seen in ages'.

And one woman joked: 'Amazing! If I were smaller, I'd live in there.'
