A spokesman for London Stansted Airport confirmed a plane had landed safely on the ground following a police incident.

The matter is now thought to be in the hands of police.

Both Typhoons circled over the airport several times, before leaving the scene and head towards Cheltenham to be refueled, before appearing to return towards base at RAF Coningsby.

There were claims the jets were responding to an urgent call-out known as a Quick Reaction Alert, or QRA.
