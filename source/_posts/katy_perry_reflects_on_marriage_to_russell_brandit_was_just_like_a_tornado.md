The 35-year-old Smile singer told Australian 60 Minutes on Sunday she was wed to the 45-year-old British comedian at a time when her career was really taking off and it was a lot to handle all at once.

It was like a 'tornado,' added the star, who welcomed daughter Daisy Dove with fiance Orlando Bloom earlier this month.

It was too much: The 35-year-old Smile singer told Australian 60 Minutes she was wed to the British comedian at a time when her career was really taking off, causing her to call the experience a 'tornado.' Seen in December 2010 in Los Angeles

'I was having great success at 23, 24 and 25 and then I met someone that was interesting and stimulating,' said Katy of the 45-year-old Forgetting Sarah Marshall star.

'It was just like a tornado, it was everything happening at once,' added the I Kissed A Girl singer who came to fame with the 2008 album One Of The Boys. 

Perry acknowledged that the marriage was not easy as she said she 'always resonated with friction and resistance and challenges.' 

Katy and Russell were the It couple of their time and wed in India in 2010 with much fanfare. But a year later there were reports of tension. 

It took her by surprise: 'I was having great success at 23, 24 and 25 and then I met someone that was interesting and stimulating,' said Katy of the 45-year-old Forgetting Sarah Marshall star. Seen in August 2011

'He's a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him,' Perry told Vogue in the past.

But things got tense and 14 months later he said he wanted out.  'Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011,' she also told Vogue.

Now she is happily engaged to Orlando Bloom whom she shares daughter Daisy.

The American singer described her relationship with the Lord Of The Rings actor as 'solid'. 

Weeks before the end: Seen on December 3, 2011; he asked for a divorce on December 31, 2011. 'He's a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him,' Perry told Vogue. 'Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011,' she added

The star went on to reveal her 'excitement' at developing an 'unconditional love bond' with their newborn.

When asked by journalist Tara Brown how she would describe her relationship with Orlando, 43, the pop star said it's 'very communicative'.

'It is a healthy, frictional, very open, very communicative [relationship]. Nothing is swept under the mat... even to the point where it's like we should probably walk into the other room if we're going to discuss something where we disagree, because we'll just do it in public.

'But, if we can get to the end of our lives together, we'll be each other's greatest teachers,' Katy continued.  

'Dating is different, weekend lovers that's fun. That's candy. This is solid. This is like the main course.'  

The Firework singer, who was heavily pregnant at the time of the interview, went on to reveal her thoughts ahead of giving birth.

'[I'm] just excited for a new adventure, and really grateful that I've been able to live already, such a great life,' she said.

'It's not all peachy keen jelly bean, let's be honest. But I'm excited for this human to come in and have an unconditional love bond [with].'

Katy and Orlando first started dating in early 2016, but split in February 2017.  

They reconciled in April 2018, and Orlando popped the question in a romantic Valentine's Day proposal the following year.  

Orlando wed Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr in 2010, divorcing in 2013 and now sharing custody of their nine-year-old son Flynn.

Orlando revealed on Sunday Today with Willie Geist in August last year that he doesn't want to get divorced a second time.

'It's important to me that we are aligned. I've been married and divorced and I don't want to do it again,' he said. 'And we're both fully aware of that.'

'She's remarkable and so I'm always impressed with that and I'm encouraged,' Orlando added.
