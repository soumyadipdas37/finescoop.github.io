Katherine Ryan marked her one year anniversary to her high school sweetheart Bobby Kootstra with a series of snaps on Instagram on Monday. 

The funnywoman, 37, gushed over her handsome husband while also poking fun at the 20 year gap in their romance, after first dating as teens.

Alongside a school throwback and a wedding shot, she added a caption on the snap reading: 'I don’t advocate getting married to anyone unless it’s @bobby_k__ Happy Anniversary to my one true love. #wewereonabreak'.

Sweet! Katherine Ryan marked her one year anniversary to her high school sweetheart Bobby Kootstra with a series of snaps on Instagram on Monday

Katherine proved herself to be ageless in the incredible throwback showing the duo at what appeared to be a school dance and then later at their wedding. 

She also added a sexy snap as she posed in swimwear with an eye-popping peek of sideboob on show as she gazed at the camera.  

Earlier this year, loved-up Katherine discussed her low-key civil partnership ceremony to Bobby. 

The star said: 'I decided to get married basically because I got together with my high school boyfriend. His name is Bobby and we were together when I was 15 or 16 and then we got back together 20 years later. Isn't that pathetic??'

 The pair were struck once again by Cupid's arrow when they met by chance in Katherine's local pub.

The stunning blonde explained that 20 years on, they had both matured and quipped that her civil partner's previous divorce had acted as a mellowing effect. 

Katherine said: 'Bobby had a life of 20 years while I wasn't with him, he's divorced. I love divorced men, it really humbles them.

'He used to be c***y, he had some growing up to do and now I like him a lot more. He is very different from high school. He has this cool calm energy.'

In her trademark self-deprecating style, Katherine joked that she looks unrecognisable from her 15-year-old self and is unsure if Bobby has realised they used to date.

She said: 'It's very different. Literally speaking, a lot of my face is different. I don't even know if he knows I'm his high school girlfriend.'
