Today host Brooke Boney is single again after splitting from her long-term boyfriend.

The 33-year-old entertainment reporter, who rarely speaks about her private life, confirmed she was back on the market during a live segment on Wednesday.

Her last confirmed relationship was with a man who lived in Oxford, England. It's unclear when exactly they broke up.

Watch out, boys! Today host Brooke Boney (pictured) is single again after splitting from her long-term boyfriend. The 33-year-old entertainment reporter, who rarely speaks about her private life, confirmed she was back on the market during a live segment on Wednesday

Brooke was 'stitched up' by her co-hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon, who invited her mother, Leonie, on the show to discuss her love life.

Much to Brooke's embarrassment, Leonie openly discussed what sort of man she would like her daughter to date. 

She even joked that she was 'pretty set' on having Zac Efron as a son-in-law, but unfortunately he's now seeing Byron Bay local Vanessa Valladares.

'Maybe she should have went on holidays earlier,' Leonie said with a laugh.

Leonie said she would be happy for her daughter to date any man, 'as long as he's a decent bloke'.

'I even told her to try a tradie,' she added, as the Today panel burst into laughter.

'I did a bit of Googling yesterday and I came up with some options. Trying to look for some single fellas in Australia is crazy.'

Brooke was visibly mortified and folded her arms at her mother suggested she date an AFL player or a famous actor.

As the co-anchors wrapped up the lighthearted chat, Karl said that he couldn't wait to discuss Brooke's love life with Leonie in more depth.

'No! Stay out of it,' Brooke warned Karl. 

Embarrassed: But Brooke, who was left red-faced at her mother's cheeky shortlist of potential suitors, warned Karl to 'stay out of it!'

Brooke has never revealed the identity of her ex-boyfriend, nor has she shared a photo of them together on social media.

In March, she made a passing reference to him during a segment on Today Extra with psychic medium Harry T about relationship superstitions. 

Brooke said: 'My boyfriend doesn't walk on the other side of a [traffic] pole. So if there's a pole on the street, he will walk on the same side as me.'

Passing comment: Brooke has never revealed the identity of her English boyfriend or shared a photo of them, and she has rarely discussed him. But back in March, she made a passing reference to her boyfriend during a segment with psychic medium Harry T

She said that her partner's Russian grandmother used to do the same - presumably because she feared walking around the pole would attract negative energy.

Brooke also briefly mentioned her former boyfriend in an interview with Traveller in 2019 when asked where her last overseas trip was. 

'Oxford in Britain for a couple of weeks to see my boyfriend,' she said.
