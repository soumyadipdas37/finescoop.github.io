Footage of Jurgen Klopp berating his Liverpool bench for celebrating Andreas Christensen's red card in their victory at Chelsea on Sunday has emerged online.

The Liverpool boss did not take kindly to a member of his coaching staff clapping and cheering when the Chelsea centre-back's yellow card for hauling down Sadio Mane on the stroke of half time was upgraded to a red by VAR.

It was reported at the time that Klopp had turned around from his spot on the touchline and shouted: 'Are you crazy? We never ever do that, ok?'.

Asked about the incident after the game, the German said: 'It was not one of my subs but another member of staff and I told him already what I think about it and he's good with that. 

'But in the moment that's something I don't want to see.'

Klopp's furious reaction drew praise from Liverpool fans on social media.

One supporter tweeted: 'Absolute class from Kloppo!' while another wrote: 'This is why the man is loved in football. Jurgen Klopp, showing class... Again.'

Twitter user @GrizzKhan wrote, 'Klopp telling all the subs and his coaches not to applaud the red card...my manager'.

Andreas Christensen saw red for hauling down Sadio Mane as he went through on goal

Referee Paul Tierney initially gave Christensen a yellow card before VAR intervened

After an even first half the red card incident appeared to swing the game decisively in Liverpool's direction.

Mane was running through on goal from a precise long pass from captain Jordan Henderson when Chelsea defender Christensen got his opposite number in a headlock and brought him down before he could reach the ball as Kepa Arrizabalaga cleared.

Referee Paul Tierney issued a yellow card but was prompted to change his mind when he went over to view the incident again on the pitchside monitor. It was when he changed the colour of his card from yellow to red that the Liverpool bench applauded.

Mane proved the difference in the second half, latching onto a Roberto Firmino cross and another mistake from Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa to make it two wins from two for Klopp's champions.

Klopp said of the incident after the game that it was 'something I don't want to see'

Klopp and opposite number Frank Lampard were involved in a touchline spat in July this year 

This is not the first time that incidents on the sidelines between Liverpool and Chelsea have grabbed the headlines.

In July Frank Lampard warned Liverpool not to get 'too arrogant' and accused Klopp's coaching staff of crossing a line and showing a lack of respect by leaping up, shouting and smirking at him during Chelsea's 5-3 defeat at Anfield.

Klopp's assistant Pep Lijnders was the target of Lampard's fury and the incident, following the award of a free-kick, was picked up by TV cameras.
