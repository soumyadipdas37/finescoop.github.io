This is the tragic moment a man was executed while sitting in a barbershop chair in Columbia.

The frightening incident took place Saturday afternoon in the Medellín neighborhood of Girardot when a gunman entered the business and shot Carlos Andrés Carmona several times in the head.

The barbershop's surveillance camera showed the barber was applying a facial cream on the 27-year-old man's face. The suspect subsequently walked through the doors and did not say a word to Carmona before he fired his weapon.

The barber walked out of the barbershop holding his hand over his head in shock.  

Authorities did not mention the motive for Carmona's death, although Girardot has encountered a rise in criminal incidents due to a turf war between two local gangs, according to local media outlet Alerta Paisa.  

Carmona's murder was the 28th that has been registered in Girardot this year, an increase of six compared to the same period in 2019, according to the Medellín security ministry.
