 THREE brothers with a passion for magnet fishing have hauled out deadly catches – a gun each.

Reece Nixon, 14, was the first to come across a weapon when he found a World War One machine gun at the bottom of a canal.

That find a year ago was followed by a handgun fished out by younger brother Riley, five.

Then last Sunday four-year-old Leo found a BB gun on one of his first fishing expeditions.

The wartime weapon, a Vickers. is now in a museum, while investigations have found the German handgun was used in an armed robbery. 

The brothers, from Leeds, regularly go magnet fishing – in which a magnet attached to a rope is dangled into water to locate metallic objects – in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. 

The boys’ father William, 49, took the first two guns to the police.
