Downing Street sowed confusion over the new coronavirus app today,  just days ahead of its launch.

Officials this morning said the delayed NHS Covid-19 app being launched in England and Wales on Thursday would not provide the automatic contact-tracing ability that was first promised.

But No10 was forced into a swift U-turn after the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed that it would have this capacity.

The app is being delivered months late and with only a fraction of the functionality first envisaged in the spring.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters today: 'It will be there to check and report symptoms, book a test, find out if you have tested positive or not and if you need to self-isolate.

'You will be able to check the risk level of your local area and it will provide for the QR code check-in on entry to various premises with your phones, instead of having to fill out a check-in box or anything else to provide your contact details.'

Asked if it would do automatic contact tracing, the spokesman said: 'I have set out to you the functions which it will have when it has launched.' 

However, within around an hour health officials insisted it would indeed have test and trace functions. 

Pilot schemes for the mobile tracing app will begin within days on the Isle of Wight and members of the public will be urged to scan in at pubs, cafes and restaurants

The initial app was meant to have been ready at the end of May but it was axed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock after a series of setbacks, which included: 

A DHSC spokeswoman said: 'Contact tracing will be at the heart of the NHS Covid-19 app. 

'The app is designed to work alongside traditional contact tracing services and testing, to help people to understand if they are at risk of infection so they can take action to protect themselves and their communities.

'It will log the time and distance a user has spent near to anyone, even if they don't know them, so it can alert them if necessary if that person later tests positive for COVID-19, and help them self-isolate, book a free test if they develop symptoms and get their results.'

Downing Street also said it is 'not the intention' to make downloading the app mandatory but 'it will be backed by a social media campaign pointing out the role it can play in helping to check and report symptoms and to help keep yourself, your loved ones and your friends safe'.

Manual contact tracing will continue to be carried out by the NHS Test and Trace operation.

 A pilot scheme for the app started last month on the Isle of Wight – where the first app was tested and failed – alongside one other location and among volunteers.

The public will be urged to scan barcodes at pubs, cafes and restaurants to provide a 'virtual diary' of their recent movements.

If another customer in a venue at about the same time tests positive for the virus, the phone owner will be alerted and encouraged to isolate for 14 days and book a test.

It's drastically different from how the original app was designed to work, which only used Bluetooth connections to create a log of other phones nearby.

That design was proven to be flawed after months of development because it failed to detect if people came into close contact with other phones.

The former system was hailed as a crucial to stamping out the coronavirus in the population.

It was devised by NHSX – the NHS's technology arm – but was abandoned in favour of one provided by Apple and Google.

Apple and Google's system is already used in several countries across the world but the government was slow to adopt it.

The main difference between the two apps is the way they store data.

Both keep a log of who someone has come into close contact with - but the NHS's app would have kept information in a centralised database, while the Google/Apple app is de-centralised. 

NHS app: Lists on NHS servers 

The NHSX app would create an alert every time two app users came within Bluetooth range of one another and log this in the user's phone.

Each person would essentially build up a list of everyone they have been in 'contact' with. This would be anonymised so the lists were actually just be numbers or codes, not lists of names or addresses. 

If someone was diagnosed with the coronavirus or reports that they have symptoms, all the app users they got close to during the time that they were considered infectious - this will vary from person to person - would receive an alert telling them they have been put at risk of COVID-19 - but it wouldn't name the person who was diagnosed. 

NHSX insisted it would have deleted people's data when they get rid of the app, but not data uploaded to the NHS server if they or a contact tested positive.

Apple/Google: Contained on phones

In Apple and Google's de-centralised approach, meanwhile, the server and list element of this process is removed and the entire log is contained in someone's phone.

That app works by exchanging a digital 'token' with every phone someone comes within Bluetooth range of over a fixed period.

If one person develops symptoms of the coronavirus or tests positive, they will be able to enter this information into the app.

The phone will then send out a notification to all the devices they have exchanged tokens with during the infection window, to make people aware they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

The server database will not be necessary because each phone will keep an individual log of the bluetooth profiles someone has come close to. These will then be linked anonymously to people's NHS apps and alerts can be pushed through that even after the person is out of bluetooth range.

It is understood that if someone later deletes the Google/Apple app and closes their account their data would be erased.
