The Ivors Academy announced the winners of The Ivors with Apple Music on Wednesday, celebrating the very best songwriting and screen composition of 2019. 

Other champions included Dave and Fraser T Smith and Mysie, who scooped Rising Star. 

Winner: Jamie Cullum beat Stormzy to scoop Best Song at this year's Ivor Novello Awards

Jamie, 41, collected his first Ivor for Age of Anxiety in the Best Song Musically and Lyrically category, with the judges describing the song as 'beautifully emotive, with an exceptionally crafted melody'. 

Stormzy was nominated in the same category for his smash hit Crown.  

Grey Area, written by Little Simz and Inflo, won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Album. 

Rising star: Other champions included Dave and Fraser T Smith and Mysie (pictured), who scooped Rising Star 

Fantastic: Grey Area, written by Little Simz and Inflo, won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Album

This is Little Simz' first award and the second for Inflo, who previously won in 2017 for co-writing Michael Kiwanuka's Black Man in a White World.

The award for Best Contemporary Song was presented to Dave and Fraser T Smith for Black. 

Their second Ivor in as many years, the judges described the work as 'important, eloquent and a song that not only empowers, but is borderless in its musicality'.

Champion: The award for Best Contemporary Song was presented to Dave and Fraser T Smith for Black

Congrats: Giant, performed and written by Calvin Harris and Rag 'n' Bone Man, with co-writing by Jamie Hartman and Troy Miller, was awarded the PRS for Music Most Performed Work

Meanwhile Bobby Krlic collected his first Ivor for Best Original Film Score for the score to Midsommar, hailed by the judges as an 'outstanding incidental score that is an inseparable part of the uncompromising vision of the film'.

Presented for only the fifth time, the Ivor Novello Award for Best Original Video Game Score was awarded to Simon Poole for Draugen. 

A first-person psychological Fjord Noir mystery set in Norway, the judges described the video game's score as 'flawless and beautifully evocative'. 

Triumphant: The award for the Best Television Soundtrack was awarded to Labrinth for his soundtrack to Euphoria

The award for the Best Television Soundtrack was awarded to Labrinth for his soundtrack to Euphoria, HBO's teen drama starring Zendaya about a group of high school students navigating love and friendship. 

It is Labrinth's first win for scoring screen music and second Ivor, having previously won for co-writing Tinie Tempah's Pass Out.

Giant, performed and written by Calvin Harris and Rag 'n' Bone Man, with co-writing by Jamie Hartman and Troy Miller, was awarded the PRS for Music Most Performed Work of 2019. 

Tackling topics such as addiction and redemption, it is the first Ivor win for Rag 'n' Bone Man, Jamie Hartman and Troy Miller and the second for Calvin Harris.

Songwriter and artist Mysie won the first Rising Star Award with Apple Music. 

Nominee: Stormzy was nominated in the Best Song for his smash hit Crown but lost out to Jamie

Created to honour young talent who demonstrate exceptional potential, the award included a new mentoring scheme from Apple Music where all five nominees receive a year-long mentorship from a well-established Academy member.

The Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year has been presented since 1974 and recognises a writer whose creativity has made an identifiable impact on the award year. 

This year's recipient was songwriter Steve Mac, who co-wrote some of 2019's stand out hits including Mabel's Don't Call Me Up and Mad Love, South Of The Border by Ed Sheeran featuring Camila Cabello and Cardi B.

More honours: Singer/songwriter Lewis Capaldi was nominated in the Most Performed Work category but lost to Calvin Harris

An Academy Fellowship, the highest honour that The Ivors Academy bestows, recognises excellence and impact in the art and craft of music creation. 

This year it was awarded to Joan Armatrading MBE, in recognition of her peerless and enduring achievements in music. 

This is only the nineteenth Fellowship that the Academy has awarded in its 76-year history, as Joan Armatrading joins a roster of songwriting greats including Annie Lennox OBE, Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John.

Annie, who was made a Fellow of the Academy in 2015, said 'Joan Armatrading was born to create beautiful music, as she has done so consistently over the decades of her life, as an outstanding singer songwriter, recording artist and performer. 

'With her definitive voice and unique guitar playing style, her songs are masterful classics. She is a legendary British artist who thoroughly deserves to be recognised and honoured with an Ivors Academy Fellowship. I'm thrilled to know that she will soon be part of this incredible association.'   

Great: Fraser T Smith poses with his second Ivor in as many years, the judges described the work as 'eloquent and a song that not only empowers, but is borderless in its musicality'
