A married mother-of-three was checking on a noise coming from outside her Queens apartment building overnight when a stray bullet smashed through her bedroom window and struck her in the head. 

The tragic incident comes amid a wave off gun violence that has swept over New York City in recent months. 

Bertha Arriaga, 43, was found mortally wounded and bleeding on the floor of her apartment on 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights by her 14-year-old son at around 12.45am.

Bertha Arriaga, a 43-year-old married mom-of-three, was shot and killed when a stray bullet flew through her bedroom window early Wednesday 

Arriaga went to the window of her apartment in Queens after hearing noises outside when someone fired a shot, striking the woman in the head 

Arriaga's brother-in-law, Javier Aguilar, said his nephew woke up his father sleeping in another room to tell him about what happened. 

Jorge Aguilar, Arriaga's husband, attempted to revive his wife by performing CPR on her, but to no avail. 

Police and paramedics were called to the scene and pronounced Arriaga dead from a gunshot wound to the head. 

'She was the best wife of all,' Jorge told PIX11 through tears. 'She cared deeply about the kids.'

Arriaga's 14-year-old son found his mother bleeding from the head on the floor of their apartment on 34th Avenue 

Jorge Aguilar described his wife, Arriaga, as the best wife and mother to their three sons, ages six, 10 and 14

The couple emigrated from Mexico and settled in Queens 15 years ago to raise a family. Arriaga is survived by her husband and their three sons, ages six, 10 and 14. 

So far, no arrests have been made in connection to the deadly shooting. 

Just hours after Arriaga's death, gunfire erupted outside a car wash in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, killing a 25-year-old man and injuring two others. 

Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday raised concerns about New York City's skyrocketing gun violence rates, saying crime is 'not going to get better on its own'

According to recent NYPD crime statistics, New York City has seen the number of shooting incidents and shooting fatalities nearly double so far this year compared to last year. 

Between January 1 and September 20, a total of 1,123 shootings resulting in 214 fatalities were reported in the Big Apple, compared with 580 shootings and 111 fatalities for the same period in 2019.   

During a press conference on Tuesday, Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took a swipe at Mayor Bill de Blasio, citing a host of quality-of-life issues plaguing New York City under his leadership, including rising gun violence rates, rampant homelessness and garbage piling up in the streets. 

'We have a problem in New York City when it comes to crime. That is fact,' Cuomo said, as Fox News reported. 'It's not going to get better on its own.' 

In July and August, shootings were up 177 and 166 per cent, respectively, compared to the same time last year.

Other major cities in the US also have seen rising crime rates. According to a study by the Council on Criminal Justice, from May-June 2020, homicides in 20 cities increased by 37 per cent, led by Chicago, Philadelphia and Milwaukee, reported CNN.
