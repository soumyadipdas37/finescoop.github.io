Chicago Bears running back and Pro Football Hall of Famer Gale Sayers has died at age 77 after recently battling dementia.

Despite playing just seven seasons due to knee problems, the 'Kansas Comet' as he was known became one of the NFL's marquee players of the 1960s, averaging 5 yards a carry for his career, twice leading the league in rushing, and ultimately becoming the youngest Hall of Fame inductee in 1977 at age 34.

'All those who love the game of football mourn the loss of one of the greatest to ever play this game with the passing of Chicago Bears legend Gale Sayers,' Hall of Fame president and CEO David Baker said in a statement. 'He was the very essence of a team player -- quiet, unassuming and always ready to compliment a teammate for a key block. Gale was an extraordinary man who overcame a great deal of adversity during his NFL career and life.'
