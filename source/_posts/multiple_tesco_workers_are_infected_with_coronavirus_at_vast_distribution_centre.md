Several Tesco workers have tested positive for coronavirus at a vast distribution centre where 1,800 staff supply 318 stores.

The warehouse, in Livingston, West Lothian, confirmed a 'small number' of colleagues who tested positive for the virus are now self-isolating at home. 

Tesco added that it has measures in place at the two million square-foot property to ensure social distancing, with masks, hand-sanitiser and gloves available to staff.

The distribution centre supplies 318 Tesco branches across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northeast England - with 3.6million boxes of produce passing through it each week.

It is open all year and employs around 1,800 people, the Mirror reported.  

A Tesco spokesperson said: 'The small number of colleagues that have tested positive for Covid-19 at our Livingston Distribution Centre are self-isolating and their close contacts have been informed.

'We take the health and safety of our colleagues extremely seriously and are working closely with public health authorities.

'We have measures in place to ensure colleagues stay two metres apart throughout our centres and hand-sanitiser, masks, gloves and visors available to all colleagues.'

It comes after food producer Greencore announced a temporary closure of its Northampton plant for at least two weeks after 292 staff tested positive for the virus. 

The move left refrigerated aisles empty of lunchtime favourites like prawn mayonnaise, BLT, and chicken salad sandwiches for shoppers and office workers around the country.

Sandwich fridges at some M&S branches were last week pictured with blinds pulled over them, with supermarket staff fixing a note on nearby empty shelves blaming supply issues for the lack of choice.

The note reads: 'We are sorry for the lack of availability across our sandwich range. We are working hard to get them back in stock as soon as possible.' 

A huge chicken factory in Norfolk was also forced to close last month after 75 workers tested positive for coronavirus. It resulted in 350 families put into Covid isolation.

Banham Poultry, in the village of Attleborough, voluntarily agreed to close its cutting room following an outbreak of the virus.

The first case of Covid was reported last Friday, when one worker said they felt unwell. By Monday, seven out of 15 tested were found to have the virus.

Almost 400 workers have now been tested, though officials claim that any potential geographical spread of the virus from Banham Poultry is low.  

And in June, a 'major' outbreak hit more than 100 workers at a British meat factory supplying chicken to KFC and M&S.
