Rev. Davis' induction into St. Luke's Church is due to be held on September 22 with limited numbers being allowed to attend due to Covid guidelines.

However, they might be disappointed to learn that Rev Davis has been married to his wife Liz for 13 years and has two young sons.

The Rev Dr Matt Davis told St Luke's Church September magazine: 'It's our prayer that as we get to know you all and minister alongside you that we would be a great encouragement and help as the Lord continues to grow his kingdom.'
