Bayern Munich are in talks with Chelsea over a stunning loan move for Callum Hudson-Odoi before the transfer window closes on Monday, it has been reported.

Bayern have a long-held affection for the England winger, having previously tried to sign him in the 2019 summer and winter windows, but they may now finally get their man on a season-long loan.

Bild report that negotiations are in 'full swing' between the two clubs, after Hudson-Odoi dropped down the pecking order in Frank Lampard's squad.

Hansi Flick is keen on bringing in the England youngster on a season-long loan deal

After the arrival of Kai Havertz and Timo Werner, it is expected that the 19-year-old will find his game-time limited this season, and Bayern are ready to swoop with a loan move before Monday's 11pm transfer deadline.

It has been reported that Bayern's sports director Hasan Salihamidzic has never taken Hudson-Odoi off his shopping list, and it now appears he may get his man.  

It is understood that Bayern were keen on deals for both Thomas Lemar and Andrej Kramatic from Atletico Madrid and Hoffenheim respectively, but they were ruled too expensive.

The winger has hired a £1,500-a-month personal trainer in a bid to impress Frank Lampard

Hudson-Odoi, meanwhile, has reportedly hired a £1,500-a-month trainer and a private pitch in a bid to improve his fitness and impress manager Lampard.

The Sun report that Lampard has made repeated demands for Hudson-Odoi to show him a better work ethic, and the player has now heeded that request.

The England youngster is said to have hired a specialist fitness guru, and is renting the entire pitch at a local non-league club twice a week for his sessions.

He is lifting extra weights, as well as being put through his paces with shuttle runs and endurance training, it has been reported.
