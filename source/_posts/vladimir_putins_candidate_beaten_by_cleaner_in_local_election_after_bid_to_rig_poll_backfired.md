Incumbent head of Povalikha rural district, Nikolai Loktev, chose his cleaner to stand against him 'to give the false impression of a real contest'

A cleaner has beaten Vladimir Putin's candidate in a local election in Russia after a bid to rig the poll backfired.

Incumbent head of Povalikha rural district, Nikolai Loktev, chose his cleaner to stand against him 'to give the false impression of a real contest'.

Marina Udgodskaya did not campaign, but she still easily won with 62 per cent of the votes as locals flung out ex-policeman Loktev, 58, a loyalist in pro-Putin ruling party, United Russia. 

The 35-year-old now feels shocked as well as ill-prepared to sweep her new broom through politics in this remote outpost.

'I didn't nominate myself. Nikolai Loktev asked me. There was simply no other person and I was like a bogus candidate,' she confessed to Podyom media.

She was there as a 'technical' or stooge candidate, a loser, she said, to give the appearance of a real race, a tactic not uncommon in Russia.

'I wanted to help him (give the appearance of a contested poll),' she explained.

'So there was only him and me on the ballot.

'I didn't think that they would vote for me, I didn't expect such a turn at all.'

Having cleaned politician Loktev's office for five years, she will on October 1 take over his desk and be in charge of 155 square miles of Kostroma region.

'I must take office, and then the powers will be passed to me somehow,' she said.

Despite her reluctance, she has become an unexpected hero for anti-Putin politicians in Russia.

Opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov posted that voters were now ready to back anyone except ruling candidates obedient to the Kremlin.

'People are ready to vote for anyone else,' he claimed.

'It doesn't matter who you are by profession, or what experience you have.

'For the beginning you need not to steal and to be able to speak with the people.

'You will be held in much higher regard than any United Russia person.'

He told her: 'I suppose if you tried the presidential elections, you would win there too.

'Because 20 years of dictatorship brought one common wish - for change. Any change.

'And you, Marina, would not use Novichok, for sure. And this is the great advantage.'
