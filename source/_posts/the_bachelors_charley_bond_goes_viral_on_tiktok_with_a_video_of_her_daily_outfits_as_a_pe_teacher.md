She may have failed to win the heart of The Bachelor's Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert. 

But Charley Bond is certainly proving to be popular online.

A TikTok video of the 25-year-old modelling her work outfits as a PE teacher has gone viral. 

Locky lost out! The Bachelor's Charley Bond has gone VIRAL on TikTok after posting a video of her daily outfits as a PE teacher 

In the clip, Charley is seen posing in a navy blue pyjama set with UGG boots, before she changes into a black T-Shirt with matching shorts that show off her trim pins. 

Her look is completed with sunglasses and her hair tied up with a pink scrunchie. 

Charley explained that her outfit is reserved for a 'hot day'. 

For a cold day, the stunner says she keeps warm by throwing on a black hoodie.

Meanwhile, her 'chill day' outfit consists of a T-Shirt with black ankle length trousers, a pink cap and Adidas sneakers.

And for 'Friday footy day', Charley wears a North Queensland Cowboys top with shorts and red football boots. 

The blonde bombshell's fans are obsessed with the video, including one who commented, 'Guarantee the boys all crush on her, maybe even the girls, it's unfair to be this pretty.'

There were also several followers who asked the blonde beauty to be their PE teacher.

Remember this? Bachelor audiences will remember when Charley whisked Locky away for some steamy one-on-one time in a mud bath at a cocktail party, prior to the Love In Lockdown episodes

Bachelor audiences will remember when Charley whisked Locky away for some steamy one-on-one time in a mud bath at a cocktail party, prior to the Love In Lockdown episodes.

Her mud bath plan worked when she received a rose later that evening, but the idea failed to go down well with the other ladies.

In particular, Roxi Kenny, who said: 'We were all super p***ed off... Save it for your single date. 

'Save it for your single time, when no-one's there and has to witness that or be around that. It's gross. I don't want to watch that.'

Upset: In particular Roxi Kenny (pictured), who said, 'We were all super pissed off. Dude, like, you have cut this whole party off by an hour at minimum'
