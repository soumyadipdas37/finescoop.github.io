FBI agents have raided two nursing homes in Pennsylvania, including one facility that was the source of the worst coronavirus outbreak in the state.  

The FBI on Thursday executed search warrants at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, as well as its Mt Lebanon site in Allegheny County, the Justice Department confirmed.  

U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said agents from the FBI, the office of inspector general for Health and Human Services, the IRS Criminal Investigation unit and the state attorney general's office were on the scene. 

FBI agents executed search warrants at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center - which had the worst coronavirus outbreak in the state - on Thursday 

Agents from several federal and state agencies were on the the scene on Thursday. Officials did not comment on the nature of the search  

He also urged anyone with information on 'suspected fraud' or 'abuse' related to long-term care facilities and the pandemic to report it to the COVID-19 Fraud Task Force.



Further information on the nature of the search was not released. 

It comes weeks after state officials launched a criminal investigation into Brighton Rehab which had the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the state. 

More than 400 residents and staff members tested positive for the virus and 73 patients died since the end of March, according to WPXI. 

State Attorney General Josh Shapiro last month confirmed the nursing home was being investigated for criminal neglect.

Officials were also due to conduct an audit at the facility earlier this year, but were unable to do after managers refused to cooperate, according to the news station.

In a statement released last month, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said their goal was to ensure Medicaid patients were receiving the services for which the state is billed by direct care providers.

'I'd still like to audit Brighton and I’m very disappointed that they did not comply, but my audit team will not undertake this review while a state investigation is ongoing.'

FBI agents also conducted search warrants at Mt Lebanon Rehabilitation and Wellness Center
