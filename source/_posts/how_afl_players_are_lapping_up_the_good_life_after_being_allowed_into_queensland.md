Fremantle Dockers stars are living it up in the Queensland AFL hub, with several players sharing pictures from an incredible waterfall adventure on Tuesday.

The Dockers have moved to Cairns for the final four rounds of the home and away season, with players lapping up their new surroundings and exploring the natural wonders of the region. 

Captain Nat Fyfe uploaded a selection of pictures from a picturesque waterfall along with fellow stars Adam Cerra, Andy Brayshaw, Caleb Serong, James Aish and David Mundy.

The AFL's condensed fixtures leaves teams with little time between matches, with the group making the most of their morning off to enjoy a bush walk and swim in their Queensland oasis. 

The group starred in the Dockers 14-point win over Melbourne Demons at Cazaly's Stadium last night, where Cerra slotted a banana kick contender for goal of the year.

The 20-year-old young gun managed 30 disposals for Fremantle in wet conditions and threaded a tight goal under pressure in the fourth quarter to give the Dockers an unbeatable lead.

Fox Footy commentator Dwayne Russell said it was 'one of the goals of the season'.

'That’s off the scale!' he said.

The Demon's loss is all but certain to knock them out of finals contention as they languish in tenth spot on the AFL ladder.

Fremantle's victory has sparked calls for rookie coach Justin Longmuir to be named Coach of the Year, lead by Fox Footy commentator Johnathon Brown.

'You can make an argument for Longmuir as being coach of the year while finishing outside the top eight. He’s been fantastic,' he said.

'You feel like you’re going to the footy and you know what you can expect from Fremantle.

'We know they’re young, they’re developing, there’s consistency in the way they set up and they play, and their effort.'

The Dockers will line up on Saturday against the North Melbourne Kangaroos before clashing with the Western Bulldogs for their last game of the season next week.

The AFL's move to Queensland has infuriated those who unsuccessfully applied for a medical exemption to skip Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's mandatory hotel quarantine.

About 400 AFL players and officials flew into the state from coronavirus-riddled Victoria a week ago after being given approval to dodge the state's lockdown.

Channel Nine reporter Tony Jones said the the hub at the Mecure Resort has turned 'out of control'.

'I don't agree with some of the people that have gone up there. You're talking about grandparents, babysitters, the girlfriend of a reporter, there's even suggestions a swimming coach has gone up there for the kids,' Jones told Footy Classified on Monday night.

The reports comes after AFL WAGs and officials were spotted living it up in 'hotel quarantine' - sipping cocktails by the pool at their luxury Gold Coast resort last week.

The vision is a world away from the experience of other travellers who have desperately fought to enter Queensland. 

 

Jayne Brown, 60, spent two weeks confined to a tiny hotel room in Brisbane following her recent return from Sydney, where renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo removed two large tumours on her brain.

The grandmother-of-seven requested an exemption from hotel quarantine to self-isolate at home on the Sunshine Coast, but was rejected twice.

She blasted Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for allowing the AFL officials to enter the state last week. 

'I don't understand it, mind-blowing,' Ms Brown told Nine News.

The Queensland government has deemed all of Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT to be coronavirus hotspots.

Travellers from hotspot states who are granted a border declaration pass are required to spend 14 days in mandatory hotel quarantine, at their own cost.   

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg accused the Queensland government of double standards. 

Mr Frydenberg said the football hub showed two sets of rules on borders given regular punters had missed out on vital medical treatment.

'It's just not on that a young woman can lose an unborn child because of confusion at the borders,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday. 

'At the same time, footy officials can go down to their hotel bar as they so-called quarantine in Queensland.

'It seems double standards on our borders.'

AFL officials and their families still need to undergo hotel quarantine after flying into the state.

But they are free to leave their room and use the pool and bar amenities, unlike other quarantine guests solely confined to their rooms.

Queensland will host the 2020 Grand Final on October 24 at the Gabba in Brisbane following a deadly coronavirus outbreak in Victoria.
