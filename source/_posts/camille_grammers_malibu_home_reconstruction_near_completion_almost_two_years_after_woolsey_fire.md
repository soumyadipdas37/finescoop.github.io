Camille Grammer was one of several notable names who lost their home in the devastating Woolsey Fire of 2018.

But the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum has been soldiering on, after the house was fully demolished.

She appears to be near completion on the reconstruction of her Malibu estate, nearly two-years after losing almost everything in the wildfire, which claimed 93,000 acres of land and destroyed more than 400 structures.

Aerial photos of the 52-year-old's home reveal an entirely new structure erected on the same land, which sits in walking distance to the beach.  

In December of 2018, one month after the fire, she wandered through the destruction in an attempt to salvage a few memories.   

Camille captioned the Instagram post: 'It has been an emotional and stressful couple of weeks. I have been going through the items I retrieved from what is left from my home. 

'The pictures of my children put a smile on my face. Thinking of those who also lost their homes.'

'They need to demo the toxic debris because the house burnt from the top down.  And they have to remove anything that’s toxic from the house and then they have to demo the rest of it and start from scratch.' 

The 90210 actress originally bought the 6,000-square-foot, gated community property in April of 2015, following her 2011 divorce from Kelsey Grammer, 65, with whom she shares daughter Mason Olivia, 18, and son Jude Gordon, 16. 

Prior to being evacuated, she managed to grab all her 'jewelry, documents, birth certificates, and passports.' 

She told People at the time: 'I also took some photographs that meant something to me. We packed as much as we could into three cars.'  

Salvaging memories: In December of 2018, one month after the fire, she wandered through the destruction in an attempt to salvage a few memories 

Emotional and stressful: Camille captioned the Instagram post: 'It has been an emotional and stressful couple of weeks. I have been going through the items I retrieved from what is left from my home'

Family memories: She added: 'The pictures of my children put a smile on my face. Thinking of those who also lost their homes' 

Up in flames: According to CBS Los Angeles, more than 3,000 firefighters were dispatched to tame the flames 

LAFD reportedly retrieved some of Camille's priceless artwork, which she collected over 20 years, as well as two Ferraris in the garage.

She added: 'They were so brave to do that. They did whatever they could. They are incredible. It's a total loss. Most everything is gone. We'll see if there is anything to salvage.' 

According to CBS Los Angeles, more than 3,000 firefighters were dispatched to tame the flames.   

Camille married attorney David C Meyer, 57, on Hawaii's Big Island just a month before the fire, later moving into a nearby beachfront property, which she renovated a couple years after purchasing. 

The couple later dropped $5.85million on a 5,483-square-foot, six-bedroom, six-bathroom home in the upscale neighborhood of Brentwood Park.
