Santander branches will be open from 9.30am until 4.30pm on Monday to Friday as of September 7

Santander has extended its branch opening hours after Money Mail revealed how banks had failed to resume normal services after lockdown eased.

Branches will be open from 9.30am until 4.30pm on Monday to Friday as of September 7.Â 

The bank had restricted its weekday hours to 10am until 3pm due to the pandemic.

Its opening hours were 9.30am until 5pm before lockdown.

Santander's Saturday hours will return to normal, with branches open from 9.30am to 12.30pm or 4pm.

Experts have warned of a cynical attempt to speed up branch closures, as firms will be able to claim fewer customers are using them.
