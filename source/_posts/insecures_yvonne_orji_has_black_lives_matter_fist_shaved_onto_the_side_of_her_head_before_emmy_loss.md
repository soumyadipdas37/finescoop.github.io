Insecure actress Yvonne Orji enlisted groomer Mickey West-Potts to shave the Black Lives Matter fist onto the side of her head for the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday night.

The Nigerian-born, Maryland-raised 36-year-old got fully glam to compete for the outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series trophy during the virtual ABC telecast.

Yvonne went head to head against seven other actresses for the Emmy, which ultimately went to Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy. 

'Nuff said!' Insecure actress Yvonne Orji enlisted groomer Mickey West-Potts to shave the Black Lives Matter fist onto the side of her head for the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday night

Orji got on the rooftop of an Atlanta hotel to pose in her Azzi & Osta gown, Christian Louboutin heels, and David Yurman jewelry selected by stylist Apuje Kalu.

The Momma, I Made It comedian had the rest of her pixie cut coiffed by hairstylist Mary Daniels and make-up artist/esthetician Drini Marie made sure she was ready for her Zoom close-up.

Win or lose, Yvonne was certainly ready to party at the hotel with five others, even rolling out a red carpet.

'Because I don't know how not to be extra,' Orji - who boasts 1.3M social media followers - said via Instastory.

Better luck next year? Yvonne went head to head against seven other actresses for the Emmy, which ultimately went to Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy (pictured)

Fierce! Orji got on the rooftop of an Atlanta hotel to pose in her Azzi & Osta gown, Christian Louboutin heels, and David Yurman jewelry selected by stylist Apuje Kalu

Werrrk! The Momma, I Made It comedian had the rest of her pixie cut coiffed by hairstylist Mary Daniels and make-up artist Drini Marie made sure she was ready for her Zoom close-up

'Because I don't know how not to be extra!' Win or lose, Yvonne was certainly ready to party at the hotel with five others, even rolling out a red carpet

'This is what's happening guys. My new name is Emmy Ma. Ask about me. I have the dopest friends. This is a thing that's happening. And I told you I was getting a red carpet!'

The George Washington University grad - who vows to remain a virgin until marriage - was sad her parents could not be with her but they only landed in the States on Sunday.

Yvonne famously scored the role of Issa Dee's (Issa Rae) promiscuous lawyer best friend Molly Carter in Insecure without an agent or any real acting experience.

HBO officially renewed Insecure for a fifth season in May, and the cast reunited virtually last Wednesday for the first table read.
