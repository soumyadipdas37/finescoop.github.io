A Texas man who went missing this weekend while tubing on the San Marcos River has been found dead.  

On Saturday, the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office received a call reporting that a tuber, identified as Jessie Austin Jr., had fallen out of his tube while with his wife around 3pm.

The caller said Austin had not resurfaced for about 10 minutes after falling into the water near Martindale, according to a press release. 

Jessie Austin Jr. (pictured), of Fresno, Texas, was found dead at the San Marcos River on Sunday afternoon 

Several agencies dispatched to San Marcos River and conducted a search of the area where Austin, 29, of Fresno, disappeared until 10pm. 

The search was paused for the night, but authorities returned around 7am on Sunday. 

Authorities discovered Austin's body around 1pm by local divers.

A spokesperson for the Caldwell County Sheriff's Department told DailyMail.com that the spot where Austin was found is popular tubing site and others have drowned in that area.

Authorities said Austin was tubing with family when he fell out of his tube and did not resurface from the water for approximately 10 minutes

Authorities said the area where Austin was found on San Marcos River is a popular tubing spot among locals 

They said around that area, the water begins to slow down and people may not realize that there's a large drop underneath the water. 

The spokesperson added that water conditions on Saturday appeared normal. 

David Lackey, who oversees the Northway Summer League Adult Basketball League, said Austin was a 'fine example of a young man raising a family.'

'I met Jesse as player and I entrusted him as someone I could use to lead a team. That requires a lot of responsibility,' he said.

'I had the privilege of being their devotional leader on many occasions as I normally do with the teams that are new. Now it can be hard to walk into a room of people that have just lost a basketball game and then spread the word of God. Jesse’s team always held this part with the highest amount of respect. 

'He was a leader, and a follower of Christ. He had a beautiful family, he loved the Lakers, whom happens to be my favorite team, so we had a lot in common.'

Lackey: 'He was a leader, and a follower of Christ. He had a beautiful family, he loved the Lakers, whom happens to be my favorite team, so we had a lot in common'

Lackey added that Austin 'recruited several players, not necessarily from a basketball perspective, but to help those come to know Christ perspective. 

'He always used manors, he was always respectful and was someone I could trust to lead a team.'

On Facebook, people who knew Austin shared condolences as they mourned the loss of a father and beloved friend.

'I can’t even believe this,' one person wrote. 'Absolutely devastating. I’m so sorry to his family & those who loved Jessie. A truly great person, gone too soon'

Another person wrote:  'Still can't believe this is real. I just saw you Friday night. My entire Austin fam is hurting right now. I'm glad we got us, but more importantly TMH got us.'
