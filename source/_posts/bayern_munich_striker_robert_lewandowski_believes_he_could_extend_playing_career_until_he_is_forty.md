Bayern Munich forward Robert Lewandowski has claimed he could extend his playing career to his 40th birthday.

The 32-year-old was in prolific form in 2019-20, notching 55 goals in the season as the Bundesliga side went on to claim the Treble, which included a first Champions League title for the Poland international.

The striker still has three years left on his contract at the Allianz Arena, but has insisted his current deal will not be his last and has backed himself to lengthen his career.

Robert Lewandowski has claimed he could continue playing football until he is 40 years old

When asked if he could play for another decade, Lewandowski told Sky Sport Germany: 'Ten years? Maybe eight.

'The current contract is not my last. I want to play longer. And I want to achieve even more, my colleagues in Munich think the same way.'

Lewandowski also admitted ending his career with the Bundesliga champions is 'an option of course' but insists he has not given too much thought to the twilight of his career.

The Bayern Munich striker scored an unrivalled 55 goals last season as the club won the treble

'I still have so many years ahead of me, I don't think about the end of my career,' he added.

Lewandowski's comments come after an unrivalled goalscoring campaign for the Pole, 34 in the Bundesliga, 15 in the Champions League and six in the German Cup.

That tally was the highest in Europe with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi finishing with 37 and 31 goals respectively.

The Juventus and Barcelona stars have won 11 of the last 12 Ballon d'Or's, but Lewandowski insisted last week he would have been the worthy winner of this year's prize had it not been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.Â 

'We won everything we could with Bayern. In every competition - Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League - I was the top scorer,' he told Polish outlet Sportowe Fakty.

'I think a player who achieves this would win the Ballon d'Or.'
