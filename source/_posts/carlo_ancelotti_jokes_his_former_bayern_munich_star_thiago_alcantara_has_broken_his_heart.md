Carlo Ancelotti has joked that Liverpool signing Thiago Alcantara has 'broken his heart'.

Thiago and now Everton boss Ancelotti worked together at Bayern Munich during the 2016-17 season before both moved to Merseyside.

'Breaks my heart, breaks my heart,' Ancelotti told the Echo.

'Thiago is a friend. He is a fantastic player, a fantastic midfielder. I had the luck in my career to train top, top players and Thiago is one of them.

'The only good thing about this signing is that he is a neighbour and that's it. I think he chose the wrong team. 

'He could choose the blue team, not the red team. I am joking. He is a fantastic player and my friend, Jurgen, will be happy. ' 

Liverpool have made an emphatic statement of their intent to retain the Premier League title by spending £65million to land Thiago and Diogo Jota.

Thiago was unveiled on Friday as he completed his £25m switch from Bayern Munich, passing a medical after arriving on an early private flight into Manchester.

Jurgen Klopp is thrilled to have signed one of the world’s best midfielders and could hand him a debut at Chelsea on Sunday.

The double signings show Liverpool mean business and Klopp is in no doubt that Thiago, in particular, will make a significant difference.

Officials at Bayern are distraught to have lost the 29-year-old Spain midfielder and the Liverpool manager could understand why.
