Love Island star India Reynolds shared an impassioned post about body shaming on Monday, amid ongoing criticism about her weight. 

The latest post from the star, who is famous for regularly posing up a storm for her 1million Instagram followers, struck a serious note, as she called on her followers to stop making comments about her figure.

In an lengthy paragraph shared on the social media platform, the 29-year-old model told fans they need to be less critical of people's appearances. 

Body confident: Love Island star India Reynolds shared an impassioned post about body shaming on Monday, amid ongoing criticism about her weight

India, who shot to fame on the show last year, penned: 'So over people commenting on my weight! I'm either 'too fat' or 'lost too much weight' you genuinely can't win! 

'Luckily I'm not trying too, and am thick skinned enough to ignore the negativity. However not everyone is. So I'd just like to remind you before you comment on people's size, is that it's not always their choice.'

The reality star emphasised that changes in weight is often not the fault of the individual and can be the result of something far more serious. 

She wrote: 'People gain and lose weight through diet but also through illness & stress. You don't know what's going on in someone's life so please don't comment negatively about their size...

Be kind: India kept the caption to her message short but powerful

'If you haven't got anything nice to say... don't say it at all.'   

Tens of thousands of fans liked the post, which India simply captioned with the words: 'Please be kind'. 

India originally shot to fame in last year's Love Island after winning the heart of lovable basketball player Ovie Soko.

During a recent interview with New! magazine, India revealed that she struggled to accept her body she was younger, but has found her self-confidence in recent years, declaring that it 'comes from within.'

She said: 'I'm really body confident now, but when I was younger, not so much. I've modelled for over 10 years and it's changed so much from when I first started off, as the models were really different to now.

'It's definitely given me more confidence in just being myself, rather than trying to look like someone at the casting next to you.'
