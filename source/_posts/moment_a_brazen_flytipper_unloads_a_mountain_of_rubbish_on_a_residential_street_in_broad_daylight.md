This is the shocking moment a van driver fly-tipped a mountain of debris on a residential street in broad daylight.

A woman's voice can be heard yelling: 'Oi!' as the driver lifts the back of the truck, sending waste across the pavement in Yardley Wood, Birmingham.

The trucker fled the scene after dumping his load on the street Sunday. 

Witnesses reported the matter to the council and on the police non-emergency 101 line in an effort to catch the trucker. 

The fly tipper drove up onto the pavement in Yardley Wood, Birmingham to dump his waste 

The driver dumped wooden pallets and off cuts of timber along with some scrap on the road

Witnesses said the driver was not concerned about people who were watching him dump his load illegally on the pavement 

The council removed the waste shortly afterwards. 

According to one witness whose house overlooks the area: 'It made me furious as it's right opposite my home.

'It is not nice to see or look at and someone could have been seriously hurt if perhaps they were partially blind or a child was playing in it.

'Also if someone was coming around the corner on their push bike, they could've ended up on top of it and really hurt themselves.

'I reported it to 101 and the council, who quickly came out and removed it from the footpath as it was a dangerous hazard.

'Also school children would be en route to school in the morning and may have felt the need to walk in the road to avoid it.'

A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: 'Fly-tipping is a criminal offence. It is a crime that damages the environment that we all have to live and work in.

'Where we have credible evidence, we will investigate and prosecute.

'We receive hundreds of reports of fly-tipping across the city every week and do everything we can to remove as much waste as possible and investigate the circumstances behind rubbish that is dumped.

'The council can only prosecute when credible evidence, that meets the criminal burden of proof, is available.'

The incident happened on Ravenshill Road, in the Yardley Wood area of Birmingham.  

Birmingham City Council arrived at the scene a short time later and removed the rubbish

Residents complained the dumped waste was a danger to children and vulnerable pedestrians
