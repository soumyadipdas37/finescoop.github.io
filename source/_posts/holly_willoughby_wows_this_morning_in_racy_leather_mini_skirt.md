The presenter looked gorgeous in her thigh-skimming skirt which she teamed with buttoned-up pink cardigan and heeled ankle boots.

Fans flocked to Holly's Instagram page, where she posted her usual snap of her ensemble, to compliment the star, with her This Morning co-star Rochelle Humes and good pal Nicole Appleton both leaving heart emojis.

Once the cameras were rolling, Holly was once again in the spotlight as she left her co-host Philip Schofiled in hysterics during a segment about pantos.

The presenting duo revealed the exciting news that This Morning would be putting on a pantomime this Christmas to bring some festive cheer to viewers.

'On Friday 11th December we'll be opening the curtains and bringing you some Christmas cheer as me, Phil and our entire This Morning family put on our fancy dress for our very own Christmas pantomime,' revealed Holly.

Holly gushed 'this is all I've ever wanted to do, all my life.' Phil replied: 'Really?... And sing and all of that?'

The blonde then admitted: 'Well, that's the problem you see. That's where it all goes wrong. I want to do it.' 









Wow! Fans flocked to Holly's Instagram page to compliment the star, with her This Morning co-star Rochelle Humes and good pal Nicole Appleton both leaving heart emojis

Phil also asked what character Holly dreams of playing, to which she immediately replied 'Cinderella... of course. I've got to do it soon, because I'm getting too old to be Cinderella. I'm already too old to be Cinderella.'

Phil insisted: 'No, you're never too old to be Cinderella. We're going to have loads of special guests popping in as well. '

One of those special guests is to be Christopher Biggins who sadly had his panto cancelled this year due to Covid. 

The TV star prompted Holly to recall the famous innuendo from pantomime Dick Whittington.

Delivering the line whilst slapping her thigh, she said: '12 o'clock and there's still no sign of D**k. I think I delivered that well! prompting an incredulous Phil to laugh. 

Cheeky! Once the cameras were rolling, Holly was once again in the spotlight as she left her co-host Philip Schofiled in hysterics during a segment about pantos
