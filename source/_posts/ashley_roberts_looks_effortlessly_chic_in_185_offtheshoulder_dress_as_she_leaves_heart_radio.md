She recently celebrated her 39th birthday.

Ashley showed off her tanned legs in the midi dress and opted for comfort on her feet with white trainers. 

She complemented her beige look with a long trench coat, tortoise shell sunglasses and a white designer handbag. 

The former Strictly star wore her blonde locks in a sleek straight look and accentuated her bronzed tan with glamorous make-up.

The media personality recently revealed she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future.

Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine in July, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

The blonde also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29.

They called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018.

The TV star said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.'
