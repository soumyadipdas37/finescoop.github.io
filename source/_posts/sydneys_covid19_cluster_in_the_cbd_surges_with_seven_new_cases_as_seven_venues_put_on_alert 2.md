New South Wales has recorded seven new cases on Sunday as a cluster of COVID-19 cases in Sydney's CBD grew to 28 infections.

Only one of the additional cases state-wide is from a returned traveller - with one under investigation and the other five linked to a known case or cluster.

The list of venues put on high alert has also grown by seven after COVID-19 cases visited locations including a suburban shopping centre, a popular CBD gym and a health clinic. 

Anyone who attended the venues is considered to be a casual contact of the confirmed cases and must monitor for symptoms.

The preventative measure to keep the virus from infiltrating nursing homes and affecting the vulnerable elderly residents will mean many will be denied a visit on Father's Day.

Meanwhile, three Sydney schools that closed on Friday after staff members contracted the virus will re-open on Monday.

They include Homebush Public School, Double Bay Public School and Ryde Secondary College.

There are 66 active COVID-19 cases in the state, including six who are in intensive care, of whom three are on ventilators.
