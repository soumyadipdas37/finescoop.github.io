She is set to strip off in Channel Seven's new All New Monty Guys & Girls this month.

But Sam Frost covered up as she hit the beach in Byron Bay with her Home and Away co-stars, Maddy Jevic and Tim Franklin, last week. 

While Maddy and Tim slipped into their swimwear for a spot of sunbaking, Sam reclined in a white knitted dress.

The frock accentuated the 31-year-old's toned and tanned arms and legs. 

The former Bachelorette star showed off her flawless complexion by going makeup free, and tied her hair up in a casual bun. 

Meanwhile, Maddy showed off her slender figure in a bright orange bikini as she sat chatting to Sam on the sand.

The girls were also joined by their co-star and Sam's onscreen love interest on the long-running soap, Tim Franklin.  

The outing comes after Sam recently courted attention by uploading two Instagram posts of herself modelling a tiny striped bikini. 

But it was her noticeably fuller-looking bust that really caught the eye.

Busted! Sam debuted a noticeably fuller-looking bust in a raunchy bikini selfie last month - before quickly deleting it. Pictured left in March 2020, right on Sunday 

In one photo, a very bronzed Sam proudly displayed her svelte frame and prodigious cleavage while posing for a mirror selfie. 

Sam also uploaded another photo of her ample assets as she lay on her back while positioning the camera above her body.  

However, Sam quickly deleted both images.

The following day, Sam uploaded an essay to her website explaining that she decided to delete the posts after receiving backlash from online trolls. 

'It was just easier to [delete the photos], than deal with people’s judgment about my body or their opinions about what I should or shouldn’t be posting,' she lamented 

Earlier in the essay, the blonde shared details of her decade-long battle with body confidence.

'I spent my twenties hiding under a black cap, wearing baggy clothes,' she wrote. 

'I was wearing clothes like that because I felt extremely insecure about my body. I felt ashamed and uncomfortable,' Sam continued.   

These days, however, Sam is feeling more confidant about her body than ever, having recently signed up for Channel Seven's upcoming charity strip show, The All New Monty. The show is set to premiere this Sunday night.
