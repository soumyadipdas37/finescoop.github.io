A Massachusetts woman who allegedly walked in on her husband while he was having sex with his mother on their couch says she always suspected an incestuous relationship was going on.

Cheryl Lavoie, 63, and her son, Tony L. Lavoie, 43, confessed to having sexual relations with each other in their home on Clarendon Street in Fitchburg back on May 20, according to authorities.

Tony allegedly told cops 'it just happened' and insisted it was the first time he had sex with his mom.

Tony’s wife, Lori Lavoie, told Fitchburg police that she ‘always had suspicions of the two of them having an intimate relationship,’ according to news.com.au.

On her Facebook page, Lori Lavoie indicated that she was separated from her husband - even though all three of them were living under the same roof.

Lori Lavoie (seen left with her husband, Tony Lavoie, 43) of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, told police in May that she long suspected her husband was having sex with his mother, Cheryl Lavoie (right), 63

Police were called to their home in Fitchburg on May 20 after Lori (above) said she walked in on her husband and her mother-in-law having intercourse

Lori told police that she had long wanted her mother-in-law to move out of the residence.

Cheryl reportedly said they had grown closer in recent months and started having sex when they began kissing.

The mother and son were living together in the same house at the time of the alleged encounter.

Police were called to reports of a disturbance at the property on May 20 and arrived on the scene to be met by the cousin of Tony's wife, reported the Sentinel & Enterprise.

The cousin told officers Tony's wife had called her after she had walked in on her husband and his mom having sex in the property, police said.

Both Tony and Cheryl allegedly admitted to the officer separately that they had consensual sexual relations with each other and told them it was the first time it happened.

When the officer asked the Lavoies why it had happened, Tony allegedly said: 'I don't know. It just happened.'

The 43-year-old then said he wanted treatment for it, according to police.

The mother and son duo were charged with incest - a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. They made their first court appearance last Thursday where they both pleaded not guilty 

Lori told police ‘that she walked in on her husband Tony Lavoie having sex with his mother Cheryl Lavoie in the living room.’

After witnessing the alleged encounter, she told police: ‘I walked into my room and closed the door.’ 

The mother and son duo were charged with incest - a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

They made their first court appearance last Thursday where they both pleaded not guilty.

They were arraigned and released on personal recognizance, with the judge ordering the pair to stay away from each other, according to court records.

The Lavoies are scheduled to appear in court for a pretrial hearing on October 27.
