Boxing legend Roy Jones Jr. was terrified of his father growing up.

'Big Roy' was an imposing Vietnam war vet who worked his son like a Marine Drill Instructor, yelling and taunting him from age five.

Those around Roy Sr. winced at the relentless mental and physical 'abuse', but the ex-club fighter and retired aircraft engineer believed he was toughening his son up to become a champion.

Roy Jr. lived in constant fear and it took a toll - as a young man he considered ending his own life.

In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, the champion pugilist revealed: 'Yes it's true. It was because of the pressure from my father, I thought if I got to take this, I'm gonna be dead, but then I talked to God and and said, "well, if I'm doing it, because this is how you want me to be, you want me to succeed at something, but it's part of the process then I got to stay and keep up".'

Today 51-year-old Jones - in training for his highly anticipated eight-round exhibition fight against Mike Tyson - is in a reflective mood about his past.

His father 'Big Roy' (pictured) was an imposing Vietnam war veteran who worked his son like a Marine Drill Instructor, yelling and taunting since he was five years old

Yes he had a tough childhood in his native Pensacola, Florida he says, but the experience guided him to become the type of father to his four sons that he always dreamed of having as a kid.

'That's very important because in the long run, you have to have life, to live,' he explained.

'In my older days, I want to be able to call and talk to my kids and have a relationship. I don't want to be like my father. So that's fine.'

Jones has four sons with wife Natlyn, twins DeShaun 'DJ' and DeAndre 'Dre', 29, Roy Jones III 'Roy J', 20, and 11-year-old Roycen.

The boxing legend says he teaches his boys to be 'accountable and responsible' and hopes he's armed them with a good attitude to take on the world.

Jones says his dad, once his boxing trainer, still lives in Pensacola but they haven't spoken for years after a fall out in the 1990s during the height of his boxing career.

'There's nothing to speak about,' he said. 'I've come to accept it, it is what it is.'

Jones has four sons with wife Natly (pictured) and says he wants to have a better relationship with his kids than he had with his father 

Four division champion Jones – widely considered to be the best pound for pound boxer in history – accepts that his dad raised him to be a 'killer' and he’s surprisingly at ease with his treatment at the hands of his dad.

'Nothing wrong with my father's parenting skills, because my father wanted to prepare me to be the best at what I do,' he said.

'And to do that you have to separate parenting from... you had to bring me up as a killer at a certain age. And guess what I'm a killer. Any rivals they got to go.

'And when you're doing it, you create a competition, because everything you do is competition.'

Speaking to DailyMailTV from his huge boxing gym on his sprawling ranch in Pensacola, Florida, where he raises chickens, ducks, turkeys, peacocks and sheep, he says this mentality has led him to closely relate to his animals, especially the feisty roosters.

'They get to a certain age, they fight the competition. I like the way they think,' he said.

'The way their lives are, is how my life is. You get to a certain age and no more father. You're your own man and you got to defend your family. No love for no other. You've got God and that's it, there's God and you and your family.'

Jones lights up when he talks about his beloved roosters, he has more than 200 chickens on his property, many running free, the other more dominant roosters tethered to their coop.

Even the steel black gates at the entrance to his remote ranch pay homage to his passion with four rooster figurines on the front.

As well as animals the boxer is passionate about training a new young brood of boxers at his gym inside a farm building on the ranch.

Jones said of his roosters, 'They get to a certain age, they fight the competition. I like the way they think. The way their lives are, is how my life is. You get to a certain age and no more father'

His passion for music, Jones has released several rap songs over the years, also involves schooling young talent in how to make it to the top and Jones plans to sign upcoming artists to his record label.

Jones has just signed a music partnership with Brandon Jay the CEO of IMA Music Group, a label distributed by Sony Music/The Orchard.

'Music has always been very inspirational to me,' he explained.

'Music is a thing that is a form of communication... you have people communicate and get their opinions out through songs.

'A song gives you the opportunity to express yourself without interruption and I love that.

'And also if I can inspire somebody or inspire my sons at the same time, makes it that much better.'

Jones plans to enter the ring for the Tyson fight to the music from his latest rap single 'Ya'll Must've Forgot - Part II'.

Brandon Jay, said of the collaboration: 'I believe Roy is changing the dynamic created by champion athletes. It's going to be a fun ride for sure.'

Jones says that helping young musicians and boxers is what he's always been about - 'giving to others.'

For the past decade Jones has traveled the world boxing and promoting good causes, acting as an inspiration to kids hoping to enter the ring.

What few people will know about American Jones is that he spends half his year in Russia, where he owns a gym and a house in Moscow.

Over the past decade Jones has fought regularly in Russia and says the Russian people treat him like a God.

'In this country it's the equivalent of being Michael Jackson or Michael Jordan. ‘Cars stop, kids come running... trying to get to the car to look in the windows, it's just amazing,' he explained.

Jones found he was spending so much time in Russia that he asked President Vladimir Putin for citizenship.

'I met him and asked if I could become a citizen and he said sure,' said Jones. 'It's really cool. Who would ever have thought that me a black man would become an American and a Russian citizen. They said we are greatest enemies, but we're not.

'Why would they love me and revere me so much. Ninety five per cent of the population of Russia know who I am and I'm American.

'So they hate us? No they can't, but if you listen to the propaganda, you swear they all want to kill us all.'

There is a downside to Jones' love affair with with red state, however.

Following the boxer's’ widely publicized meeting with Putin in disputed Crimea, Ukraine placed him on a blacklist of 'traitors', 'separatists' and 'terrorists'.

'I've still been training every day. I'm ready,’ Jones said of his upcoming fight against Mike Tyson wiht his brow dripping with sweat after completing a session with his trainer

Jones' trainer, Valrice 'Cornerman' Cooper, AKA Whop, certainly thinks his fighter means business. Whop, who has been in Jones' corner for eight years, says Jones' training and conditioning has been 'evolving' and the delay in the fight will help him

Following the boxer's’ widely publicized meeting with Putin in disputed Crimea, Ukraine placed him on a blacklist of 'traitors', 'separatists' and 'terrorists'.

Right now Jones is sticking to American soil - deep in preparation for the upcoming exhibition fight against Mike Tyson in Carson, California on November 28.

While much of the hype has been about former heavyweight champ Tyson's comeback after 15 years out of the ring Jones isn't deterred.

Many boxing fans fancy knockout king Tyson to win the match.

Mike Tyson (pictured) and Jones did not meet during their boxing heydays and fans are salivating at the two men going head to head. 

But Jones is confident.

Asked what he thought his chances were, he replied irriated: 'Chances? I don't have chances, I win. I ain't winning, I ain't going in there. What are his chances? I don't have chances, I go for the win.'

Jones concedes Tyson is a 'bigger puncher' but says he can box smarter and says his speed will be decisive.

But he added: 'You make one mistake, you'e out for the night. You still gotta be careful, just because you're speedy and fast, you have to be careful because you can run into something that makes it twice as devastating.'

Many boxing commentators and experts have said that because the fight is an exhibition neither fighter will be going for the knockout.

But Jones doesn't agree and says he won't hold back because he knows his opponent won't.

'How can you stop somebody from knocking somebody out,' he said. He (Tyson) had an exhibition in 2003, knocked the guy out in the first round.

'So how are you gonna stop him from knocking somebody out? That's all he knows.'

Jones' trainer, Valrice 'Cornerman' Cooper, AKA Whop, certainly thinks his fighter means business.

Whop, who has been in Jones' corner for eight years, says Jones' training and conditioning has been 'evolving' and the delay in the fight will help him.

And he too believes Captain Hook's speed will be the decisive factor against Tyson.

'His condition is evolving and evolving and his reflexes evolving and evolving. So he more like getting to be the Roy, not of old, but of age.

'He's still probably one of the fastest heavyweight, cruiser weights in the game today. And he's showing that, he is showing his speed more often than he was at the beginning.

'Roy has been gifted with some extraordinary reflex, some extraordinary speed in his hands, and he never lost that.'

The bout will see former world heavyweight champion Tyson’s big return to the ring after 15 years out and Jones has been a longtime fans’ favorite after becoming the first middle-weight champ in over 100 years to win the heavyweight title as well 

Jones' glittering career began when he represented the US at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, where he won a silver medal after a highly disputed loss to Park Si-Hun in a light middleweight final that saw him land nearly three times as many punches as his opponent.

The controversy surrounding the fight prompted a complete overhaul of the scoring system for Olympic boxing.

As a professional, he captured world championships at middleweight, super middleweight, light heavyweight and heavyweight.

He became the only fighter to win titles in both middle-weight and heavy weight in over a 100 years.

He finally retired in 2018 but Jones says he 'hasn't stopped'.

'I've still been training every day. I'm ready,’ he said, his brow dripping with sweat after completing a session with his trainer.

Tyson and Jones did not meet during their boxing heydays and fans are salivating at the two men going head to head.

The four-hour fight night will be airing globally with the main three-hour card on Pay-Per-View and PPV streaming on www.TysonOnTriller.com.

The fight is the first event of a series produced under Mike Tyson's Legends Only League.
