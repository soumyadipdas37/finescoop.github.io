Sonny was wearing a white onsie and is already rocking a full head of ginger hair, just like his father.

Briony revealed that nothing could have prepared her for the joys of parenthood. 

She said: 'Nothing could have truly prepared me for your entrance into this world; a journey of complete surrender and the most intense surges of energy I have ever felt in my life. 

'But I understand now that it had to be this way. How else could my heart come to live outside of my body?'

In August, she confirmed the birth of her son on social media and revealed his official date of birth and weight.

She penned: 'Sonny Aston. He calmly entered our world 6 weeks early on 11.08.20 at 5lbs 7oz and we couldn’t be more in love'. 

The yoga instructor was expecting to welcome her baby in September and had been documenting her journey online.

Briony and Sam first announced they were expecting a boy when speaking with OK! magazine, saying: 'We're having a boy!

'It was a massive surprise when we found out, as there are loads of girls in our families, so we were adamant we were having a girl.'

The couple also revealed they had only been trying for a baby for little over a month before getting the positive result. 

Sam, whose Coronation Street character Chesney is parenting quads on the popular ITV soap, said he and Briony would love a big family but admitted they were glad they were just expecting the one child.
