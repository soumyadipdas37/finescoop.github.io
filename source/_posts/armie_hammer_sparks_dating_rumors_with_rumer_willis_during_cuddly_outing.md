Armie Hammer has sparked dating rumors with Rumer Willis, less than two months following his split from his wife of 10 years, Elizabeth Chambers.

The rumored new couple was spotted putting on a cuddly display while out in Los Angeles together on Wednesday, in pictures obtained by Page Six. 

Armie, 34, and Rumer, 32, held each other close while enjoying a summer's day together.

At one point during their masked-up outing, the pair did let each other go.  

Not only are the pair hitting it off in real life, but online they are showing each other some love as well.

The duo follow each other on Instagram, and last week Rumer commented on a video Armie posted of himself 'flying into the next year'.

The outing comes just weeks after Armie and his ex Elizabeth announced they were going their separate ways following 10 years of marriage and two children together.

Armie posted a photo of him and Elizabeth in happier times, and wrote: 'Thirteen years as best friends, soulmates, partners and then parents. It has been an incredible journey, but together, we've decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage.

'As we enter into this next chapter, our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority.

'We understand this news lends itself to public dialogue, but in the interest of our children and our family, we're asking for privacy, compassion and love during this time.'

Armie and Elizabeth wed in 2010, and welcomed daughter Harper, five, and son Ford, three.

Elizabeth filed for divorce prior to their social media announcement, where she cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for their separation.

A source claimed to UsWeekly that the marriage breakup had been a long time coming.

'They have been having trouble in their marriage for quite a while and each doing their own thing,' the outlet's source shared.

Another insider shared: 'Right now, their biggest concern is their children and how this change will impact them. Their children are their top priority and always will be.'

'The split is amicable and they will work through this difficult time with love and respect,' the insider added.

Rumer, meanwhile, was previously linked to actor Ricky Whittle in 2014.

She was also reportedly 'infatuated' with her 2015 Dancing With The Stars partner Val Chmerkovskiy, even allegedly getting a tattoo commemorating their partnership.

But the tattoo was reportedly removed after Val began dating DWTS star Jenna Johnson, whom he ultimately married.

'Now she feels like a fool, so she's now undergoing this painful tattoo removal,' a source told Page Six.
