Juventus star Douglas Costa has turned down the advances of Manchester United to fight for his place at the club, according to Italian media. 

The Red Devils have been searching for a new right winger for the entire summer but have frustrated fans by failing to bring in Dortmund's Jadon Sancho, who has a £108million asking price, while Ajax's Donny van de Beek has been the only arrival.

As Old Trafford officials weigh up alternatives to Sancho, the club have been linked with the likes of Ousmane Dembele, while Calciomercato have reported that United were ready to open talks with Brazilian Costa. 

Douglas Costa has reportedly turned down the chance to join Manchester United this year 

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is desperate to secure a new right winger to take his side to the next level

But the Italian outlet claims that Costa is unwilling to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men and instead wants to prove his worth to new coach Pirlo in Turin.

The report adds that while Juventus would be open to selling to rake in funds for incoming signings, United have 'no chance' of convincing Costa and could now turn to Dembele instead. 

Costa has been recognised as one of the most talented wingers in world football in recent years but the last few seasons at Juventus have been blighted by a succession of injury problems, making just seven starts in Serie A in 2019-20. He now looks to be out of favour - failing to earn a start in the first two league games of the current campaign. 

He has played a total of 103 games for the Old Lady, scoring ten goals. Earlier this summer he admitted he had a joke with team-mate Alex Sandro that he's had more scans than games played thanks to his fitness woes. 

But reports in Italy claim the Brazilian is keen to fight for his place in the team at Juventus 

'There are times when I think: "Can I still play?" he told The Players' Tribune.

'[That's] because I go out on the pitch and get injured again. Then, when I watch it on TV, I remember this is my passion and that I can still play at a high level.

'This is what keeps me alive, I know football comes easy to me. It has nothing to do with money or being famous.

'The point is to do what you enjoy and have fun doing it. That's my objective. I joke with Alex Sandro that I've had more scans than I've played games.'

Costa has suffered with injury issues over the years but is determined to put them behind him

The 30-year-old started his career with Gremio in his native Brazil before being snapped up by Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine, where he first rose to prominence as he made over 200 outings, scoring 38 goals. 

He got his big move to Bayern Munich for £27m in 2015 after five years with Shakhtar, winning two Bundesliga titles before being loaned out to Juventus initially. 

After a successful first season saw him net four goals and provide 12 assists, the club signed him permanently for £36m, but he has failed to reproduce the same form.
