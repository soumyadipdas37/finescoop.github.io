Sonja credited the local scenery for her dewy demeanor in a photo from vacation at the Casa Salles Hotel Boutique in Tequila, Jalisco, Mexico.

'It was a no-brainer – gravity had taken its toll, I was also exhausted and I needed a “pick me up”. I entrusted my face to the best @drjacono  and he hit it out of the park.'
