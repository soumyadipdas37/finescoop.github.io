Luis Suarez was greeted by photographers, journalists and Juventus fans as the Barcelona striker arrived in Perugia to take an Italian exam. 

Suarez has been deemed surplus to requirements at the Nou Camp by new boss Ronald Koeman and that has accelerated interest in him from Italian champions Juventus. 

But with Andrea Pirlo limited as to the number of non-EU (European Union) players he can acquire in one window, the club needed Suarez to pass his exam in Perugia and acquire dual nationality to make a transfer possible this month.

Gazzetta dello Sport reported that the player achieved the B1 certification diploma after a one-hour exam. 

He was reportedly tested in four key areas: listening and comprehension of oral texts, reading and writing in Italian, how to use Italian on a daily basis and a face to face dialogue to test his speaking skills.

Suarez took part in training with his Barcelona team-mates earlier on Thursday before flying to Perugia for the university exam. 

Serie A rules state Juventus can only sign two non-EU players each year and Brazilian midfielder Arthur, who joined from Barcelona earlier in this window, took one of the spots

Juventus have already brought in Brazilian international Arthur Melo and Unites States midfielder Weston McKennie this summer, limiting their options in pursuit of the 33-year-old striker.  

The transfer deadline closes on October 5 but Suarez's appearance at the university in Perugia on Thursday is the clearest indication yet that he is pushing to secure a move to Turin to join Juventus. 

Suarez arrived in denim shorts, trainers and a white Puma t-shirt as he was seen wearing a face mask due to the ongoing health concerns for players amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

There were reported jeers on his arrival at the university with some passers-by making jokes about Giorgio Chiellini, who Suarez famously bit at the 2014 World Cup when playing against Italy for Uruguay.
