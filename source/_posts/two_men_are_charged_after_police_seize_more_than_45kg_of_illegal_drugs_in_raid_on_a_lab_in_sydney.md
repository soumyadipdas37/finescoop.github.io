Two men have been charged after police seized more than 4.5kg of illegal drugs and busted a clandestine laboratory in Sydney's southwest.

In March, officers from the State Crime Command's Drug and Firearms Squad began investigating the manufacture of prohibited drugs across the area.

Officers arrested a 41-year-old Minto Heights man during a vehicle stop at Moorebank on Wednesday.

Officers seized more than 4.5kg of MDA - a derivative of MDMA, also known as ecstasy - from the Moorebank property as well as chemicals, precursors and solvents and equipment used to make drugs.

'The laboratory itself was sophisticated in its design and contained significant quantities of chemicals and solvents used to manufacture prohibited drugs - in particular MDA,' Detective Acting Superintendent Jayne Doherty said on Thursday.

At the Minto Heights and Lugarno homes, officers seized a firearm, electronic stun device, ammunition, electronic devices, documentation and an amount of methylamphetamine, or ice.

The younger man was charged with manufacturing a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and the older man was charged with participating in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.

Both men were refused bail and will appear at Liverpool Local Court on Wednesday.
