Lottie took centre stage in the images as she displayed a hint of her taut midriff in a crop top and leggings as she modelled the fashion brand's new activewear.

The sister of One Direction's Louis styled her hair into brands and added a glam palette of make-up, while rocking the various, colourful ensembles. 

Lottie looked amazing as she pulled off a number of poses during the gritty shoot which took place on the streets of East London.

Meanwhile, Joanna also showcased her physique as she slipped into black gym gear for the shoot.

The reality starlet styled her caramel locks into a sleek plaited ponytail, while she struck a pose for the camera.

The ladies were supported by social media stars Simone and Ama, who looked fabulous as they rocked their colourful ensembles for the campaign. 

Of the 'This Is Us' campaign, Boux Avenue says: 'The bold and strong message empowers customers to bring the workout to their own individual, unique lifestyles, in a way that truly works for them.'

Late last month, Lottie put her sensational figure on display in a slew of sizzling snaps shared to Instagram amid her Ibiza holiday with beau Lewis Burton, 28, who was the boyfriend of the late Caroline Flack.

Looking sensational, Lottie slipped into a coral pink bikini that showed off her toned abs, while the plunging top gave a glimpse of her cleavage. 

Lottie's swimwear from Boux Avenue was cut high on her waist to accentuate her slender legs, while it also highlighted her sun-kissed skin.

The stunner went on to model another swimming costume from the brand as she wore a plunging dark blue swimsuit.

It comes as she and Lewis were seen packing on the PDA during an afternoon of sunbathing in Ibiza, despite being seen in the midst of a tense exchange just hours earlier. 

Although Lewis and Lottie initially denied they were dating, they had put on a very affectionate display abroad after they touched down in the Balearic island last month.

They are said to have bonded over the grief of losing their respective loved ones.

She sadly lost her mother and sister in recent years and Burton lost Caroline in February.

Lottie's sister Félicité, 18, died after an accidental drug overdose, three years after the death of her mother Johannah, who died of cancer. 

It's understood Lottie became better acquainted with Lewis at a house party in May hosted by Caroline's close friend Lou Teasdale, 36, which was held to mark three months since her tragic passing.
