The Masked Singer introduced a new two-headed costume and the first puppeted outfit on Sunday during a preview of its upcoming fourth season on Fox.

Show host Nick Cannon, 39, hosted the preview along with panelists Robin Thicke, 43; Jenny McCarthy, 47; Ken Jeong, 51, and Nicole Scherzinger, 42.

The fourth season will debut September 23 on Fox with 16 contestants including the first duet costume for the Snow Owls and the show's first puppeted costume for Baby Alien.

The 16 contestants combined have 46 Grammy nominations, 23 platinum records, one Olympic gold medal, five Super Bowl appearances and four stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Nick revealed the Snow Owls costume required more than 1,200 fabricated turquoise beads and 40,000 feathers to complete and also is the first mobile costume in The Masked Singer history.

The Snow Owls offered their first clue as they were shown pictured near a barn.

'You can try to figure out who we are, but as for who is more talented, it's a tie,' one of the owls said.

Nick also introduced the show's first puppeted costume with Baby Alien.

Baby Alien measured in at less than three-feet tall and was crafted from high-density foam by top puppet fabricators in the country.

'For the first time ever, the singer's body type is completely hidden from view, which means you'll have to work twice as hard to figure out this baby,' Nick said.

Baby Alien for its first clue said, 'If you're looking for a hint about this Baby Alien, all you have to do is look to the stars. America, trying to figure out this unidentified flying object will leave you lost in space'.

The other contestants include: Broccoli, Crocodile, Dragon, Giraffe, Gremlin, Jellyfish, Lips, Mushroom, Popcorn, Seahorse, Serpent, Squiggly Monster, Sun and Whatchamacallit.

The sneak peek also included visits from past contestants including Jesse McCartney aka the Turtle, Kandi Burruss aka Night Angel, Barry Zito aka Rhino and Bow Wow aka Frog.

'Being in those costumes and performing is hard. It's going to be super hot in that costume,' warned Kandi, 44, who won season three of The Masked Singer.

Kandi also encouraged contestants to get their characters across with physical movements to gain the favor of the crowd and panelists.  

Nick provided details on the elaborate costumes and said that Jellyfish was 'one of the most delicate costumes' in the show's history.

Jellyfish's costume features boots with three-inch platform heels and match the bodysuit to give a 'real jellyfish glow'. 

The Serpent costume had one of the biggest mouths ever on the show and also features six robotic snake arms.

'For the first time ever, animatronics have officially been integrated into a Masked Singer character,' Nick said.

The Dragon meanwhile required more than a dozen pounds of water-based clay and foam to mold and sculpt its detailed mask.

'If you want a hot clue to finding my identity, just look into stocks and bonds. America, you can search every dungeon to find this Dragon's identity, but you won't pierce my protective armor,' Dragon said for its first clue.  

Season one of The Masked Singer premiered on Fox in January 2019 and was won by T-Pain, 34, as Monster.
