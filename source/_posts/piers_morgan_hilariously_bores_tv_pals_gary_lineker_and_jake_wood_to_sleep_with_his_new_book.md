Piers Morgan hilariously joked that he sent TV pals Gary Lineker and Jake Wood to sleep with his new book Wake Up.

The unlikely trio headed for a boozy dinner at Spanish tapas restaurant Cambio De Tercio in London's Kensington on Wednesday, with all three sharing a snap of their night out on Instagram.

And Good Morning Britain host Piers, 55, couldn't help but bring his latest book to the table, much to the chagrin of his fellow dinners.

Not impressed? Piers Morgan hilariously joked that he sent TV pals Gary Lineker and Jake Wood to sleep with his new book Wake Up

The image sees a beaming Piers proudly holding his new book aloft while football pundit Gary, 59, and EastEnders star Jake, 48, pretended to nod off at the table.

Captioning the moment, Piers penned: 'The book launch is off to a thrilling start! Both guests loved it... #WakeUp.'

While Piers' former Twitter nemesis Gary didn't appear enamored by the presenter's book launch, it seems that his evening went from bad to worse as he received the latest football scores.

Whoops: Captioning the moment, Piers penned: 'The book launch is off to a thrilling start! Both guests loved it... #WakeUp'

Uh oh: While Piers' former Twitter nemesis Gary didn't appear enamored by the presenter's book launch, it seems that his evening went from bad to worse as he received the latest football scores

Piers shared a snap of Gary flipping him the finger as grumpy Leicester City fan Gary held up a phone which revealed his beloved team had lost against Arsenal. 

Goading his pal, he simply wrote alongside the snap: 'Enjoy the game, Gary?' alongside crying with laughter emojis. 

Piers' lads' night out comes after he made a reference to his 2009 Burger King campaign after the fast food chain sarcastically said: 'Agreeing with Piers Morgan - it must be 2020' in a tweet shared on Wednesday.

The broadcaster praised the company's 'world-class marketing' skills as it marked two years since the launch of the Stevenage Challenge - an advertising campaign which encouraged football fans to turn Stevenage FC into 'the biggest club in the online world'.

After the famous brand poked fun at his message, the host made sure to bring up their past ties as he responded: 'You lot once paid me a fortune to strip virtually naked for your customers. FYI.' 

The media personality's original tweet read: 'This is world-class marketing...Congrats @BurgerKing & @StevenageFC - so smart', to which Burger King replied: 'Agreeing with Piers Morgan - it must be 2020'.



Awkward! The presenter, 55, praised the company's marketing skills as it marked two years since the creation of the Stevenage Challenge, but he was met with a frosty reception

The journalist's shoot with the food giant saw him strip down to just a velvet cloth as he laid in front of a roaring fire to promote its meat-scented cologne called Flame.

Playing down suggestions of a publicity stunt, a Burger King spokesman said at the time: 'It's a very manly smell. It's a real change from the his-and-hers type scents. It's well known that certain foods can increase your libido.

'Flame has a hint of grilled beef but that has quite masculine connotations. It is almost like a pheromone.'
