Mickey Guyton cradled her baby bump as she hit the red carpet for the ACM Awards in Nashville this Wednesday.

The 37-year-old singing sensation cut a glamorous figure in an off-the-shoulder white gown with a luxuriously massive train.

She hit the red carpet at country music's iconic Grand Ole Opry ahead of her musical turn at the socially distant awards extravaganza.

Mother to be: Mickey Guyton cradled her baby bump as she hit the red carpet for the ACM Awards in Nashville this Wednesday

After the carpet portion she took the stage of the Grand Ole Opry to perform with Australian country star Keith Urban who hosted the show.

She delivered a stirring rendition of What Are You Gonna Tell Her? which is about a parent trying to explain bigotry to a child.

The song begins: 'She thinks life is fair and God hears every prayer, and everyone gets their ever after. She thinks love is love, and if you work hard that's enough - skin's just skin and it doesn't matter.'

Her lyrics continue: 'And that her friend's older brother's gonna keep his hands to himself, and that somebody's gonna believe her when she tells.'

Mickey arrived at the event in a dove white gown reminiscent of Old Hollywood, wearing her hair in a lightly wavy do.

Accentuating her screen siren features with makeup, she flashed a bit of leg through the high slit up her frock's right side.

Her cape was so long that it stretched into a train, which was neatly spread out behind her as she sang onstage at the Grand Ole Opry.

Mickey balanced on a pair of silver ankle-strap stilettos as she sang up a storm into the microphone, which matched her dress.

The country songbird announced her first pregnancy last month and revealed that she was due sometime next year.

She wrote alongside her Instagram reveal: 'God sent me an angel in these dark times and I am beyond grateful and terrified and all of the things.'
