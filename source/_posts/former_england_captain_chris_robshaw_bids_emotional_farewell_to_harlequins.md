Chris Robshaw bid an emotional and bittersweet home farewell to his beloved Harlequins on Monday.

The former England captain and club legend pulled the curtain down on his illustrious Stoop career, revealing in a poignant post-match TV interview that playing for the west London side had been all he had ever dreamed of.

But Robshaw, who earned 66 caps for his country, 43 of them as captain, missed out on the hero's send-off he deserved with the match played behind closed doors because of Covid-19 restrictions.

The former England captain was denied a winning ending in his final home outingÂ 

'I feel emotional. Last time out at the Stoop without the opportunity to share it with the fans,' Robshaw told BT Sport.

'I'm sad I don't get to share this with them.'

The back-row star was also denied a winning result in what was his 299th club appearance as Wasps battled back to beat his 14-man side 32-23 in the Premiership.

The 34-year-old, who joined the club's academy as a 17-year-old, admitted: 'In sport we don't always get the fairytales we dream about and always hope for.

'Of course you always want to win more and be more successful but for me itâ€™s been a hell of a ride. In sport, you take the good times with the bad times.

'Iâ€™ve loved my time here but it goes quickly. In the blink of an eye you are a 17-year-old kid playing out here and 16/17 years later itâ€™s all over.

'Iâ€™m sure there will be days when I look back with fond memories.'

Robshaw has spent his entire career with Harlequins and is set for a new challenge in USA

Robshaw revealed he is now looking ahead to a new challenge playing for US Rugby side San Diego Legion.

But he admits he knew it was time to quit top-flight English rugby. 'I think you know in your mind and body when the timeâ€™s right and for me it feels right,' he added.

'For me itâ€™s now about looking forward to a new opportunity in my life â€“ me and my wife going Stateside and enjoying a bit of California sun, playing a bit of rugby and having a bit of fun.'

Robshaw will play his last ever game for Harlequins - his 300th in all competitions - in Sunday's Premiership match at Leicester.

And he revealed helping Harlequins bank their first and only Premiership title in the 2011-12 season was a personal highlight during his long club stint.

'To lift the only kind of Premiership cup we have, it doesn't get any more special for that for a boy who supported and captained the club,' he added.

'It's all I've ever known and all I've wanted to know. I feel truly honoured.'
