Chelsea are set to accelerate their interest in Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy this week.

The pursuit of Mendy has been masterminded by Chelsea's technical director Petr Cech, the former club goalkeeper and legend who played for Rennes before his move to Stamford Bridge in 2004. 

The Blues are desperately trying to find a new keeper, having already shown interest in Ajax's Andre Onana, Burnley ’s Nick Pope and Borussia Dortmund’s Roman Burki, to name a few.

The Blues are desperately trying to find a new keeper to rival first choice Kepa Arrizabalaga

But, according to the Mirror, their attentions will now be turned to Edouard Mendy as they look for a new No 1 ahead of the Premier League season.

They have been on the hunt for a goalkeeper for some time to rival current choice Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has fallen out of favour and become unsettled at Stamford Bridge. 

After links with a move back to Spain, the £72million stopper made a u-turn and revealed that he wants to stay in London and fight for his place. 

Mendy is believed to cost Chelsea around £18million as they continue their spending spree

Mendy is believed to cost Chelsea around £18million, as owner Roman Abrahmovic continues to splash the cash in the club's summer rebuild under Frank Lampard.

The London club have already welcomed Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell and Thiago Silva before most notably finalising a huge £89million deal for Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen. 

Chelsea have already spent north of £200million as Lampard looks to build a new-look squad in time for the 2020/21 campaign.
