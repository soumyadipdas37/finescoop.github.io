A doctor with a multi-million dollar mega mansion has been forced to sell up after an even bigger home next door 'invaded her privacy'.

Retired anesthetist Freya Keogh has offloaded her $12million Jutland Parade home in Perth's western suburbs for a cool but cut-price $10.35million.

She complained that the newly-built super dwelling overlooked her swimming pool and blocked out the stunning river views - bringing down the price.

The ugly neighbourhood dispute was fought out over a number of years in a very bitter and public battle.

The local council initially sided with Dr Keogh's calls to stop the mammoth property being built, citing excessive construction noise and privacy concerns as the main reasons for the ruling.

But the State Administrative Tribunal disagreed and the council soon backflipped on its decision, although a few of Dr Keogh's demands were met.

She told the West Australian she had 'a few wins' which included a reduction in the height of a fence.

Dr Keogh was also allowed to engage a development planner to negotiate the ongoing construction works. 

The development Ms Keogh hates so much is not technically just one mansion, it's actually three owned and lived in by the same family.

The Franco family made their fortune in the 70s and 80s with the industrial firm, the Fero Group.

Its lucrative business operates as a steel manufacturing and anti-corrosion service, that provides products and support to oil, gas and mining companies, as well as some civil, marine, commercial and industrial firms. 

The five-storey 3500sqm middle home, is owned by Mario Franco and his wife Maggie.

It's now the largest home in Western Australia and has roughly the same amount of floor space as a supermarket complex - or about 15 average-sized homes.

The two four-storey mansions either side belong to sons Robert, the company's finance director, and Michael, the company's managing director.

The homes stand at a modest 2800sqm in comparison with enough garage space for about for 16 cars each.

Although the sale is not yet fully official, Ms Keogh said in her mind she has already moved on from the the long-running saga.

'Mentally, I've already waved them goodbye,' she said.
