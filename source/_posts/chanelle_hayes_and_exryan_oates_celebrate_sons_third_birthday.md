'As you might guess from these pics... he is Dino mad (and not too keen on people singing happy birthday to him). 

'We had a socially distanced Dino garden party (turned house party due to the rain) with his friends and our family and we all had a lovely time. As always, the balloons were from @balloonfairy.co.uk and cake was so gorgeous from @_cherrycakes_ .

'It was meant to be Frankies Christening today but we will celebrate that soon when we are allowed all our loved ones with us. #happybirthday #momofboys #mumofboys #coparenting.'

Yum! Chanelle posted a delicious-looking snap of Frankie's dinosaur-themed birthday cake 

Chanelle and Ryan first separated in August 2017 after she claimed he had walked out on her just three months after welcoming son Frankie.

The duo are said to have rekindled their romance just months later but split for good in 2019.   

It comes after Chanelle shared a heartbreaking message about loneliness and 'feeling down'.

Alongside the picture, a message read: 'The saddest thing is when you are feeling real down, you look around and realise there is no shoulder for you.' 

Chanelle did not elaborate on why she was feeling down and has yet to post a follow up message to her account.
