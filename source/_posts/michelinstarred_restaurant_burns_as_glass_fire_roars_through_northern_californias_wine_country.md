A three-Michelin-star restaurant has been destroyed in a wildfire currently ravaging Northern California's wine region. 

The Restaurant at Meadowood, which forms part of the luxury Meadowood Resort in the Napa Valley, was reduced to rubble when it was torched by the Glass Fire on Tuesday afternoon. 

The blaze, which started Sunday and is only two percent contained, has already scorched more than 36,200 acres of land north of San Francisco. 

While there have been no reports of fatalities from the Glass Fire, at least 95 structures have been destroyed.   

The Restaurant at Meadowood, which had been operating since the 1980s and offered a famed $500 per person menu, was among the buildings that could not be saved. 

Shocking images shared to Twitter by local reporter Adam Housley showed firefighters standing helplessly as flames engulfed the upmarket eatery.

The remains of the upmarket eatery are seen on Wednesday evening

The same day, evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people were issued to residents living in Napa and Sonoma counties - the heart of Callifornia's wine country. 

Several vineyards have already been torched in the Glass Fire, including the Chateau Boswell, also located in St. Helena. 

The Chateau Boswell, established back in 1979, was one of the most reputable wineries in the Napa region, with visitors flocking the famous site from across the world. 

The Glass Fire also destroyed $5 million worth of wine at the nearby Castello di Amorosa, but firefighters managed to save a $30 million castle-style structure on the estate. 

Meanwhile, there are fears that smoke contamination could destroy an entire year's worth of grapes in California's wine country, even if vineyards managed to be saved. 

According to ABC 7, trace levels of smoke taint have already been detected in grapes at Sonoma's McEvoy Ranch. 

Smoke exposure often makes wine taste sour and bitter, meaning that exposed grapes are rendered unusable. 

Samantha Dorsey, who is president of McEvoy Ranch, says the grapes will now be left to rot.  

'It's devastating because it's an entire year's worth of work," she told the news network.
