Celebrity milliner Nerida Winter has shut the doors of her iconic Sydney boutique after 23 years of business, Australia's latest fashion fatality at the hands of the coronavirus crisis.

The hat and accessories giant, who is synonymous with horse racing, has created pieces for Australian models including Jennifer Hawkins, American stars like Nicole Richie and even Crown Princess Mary of Denmark.

Cancellation of the 2020 Spring Racing Carnival amid the ongoing pandemic caused a significant drop in demand for Winter's couture designs and the subsequent closure of her Double Bay shop, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

But despite shutters being pulled, the designer's mainstay has always been her elite private client book which isn't reliant on a brick-and-mortar storefront.

'I was a bit sad at first but really, for me, it's all about my private clients and I don't really need the overheads of a shop for that,' Ms Winter told Private Sydney.

Other standouts from her star-studded clientele include Dannii Minogue, Jesinta Campbell and Miranda Kerr. 

Ms Winter said she is toying with hosting pop-ups and occasional evening events where clients can sip champagne while browsing her latest designs.

Famous for fusing haute couture and racewear, Nerida Winter has been bringing her unique blend of fashionable elegance to racetracks around the world for more than two decades.

Her bespoke creations often grace the pages of esteemed fashion bibles, with features in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Elle magazine.

In an interview with Australian racing royalty Kate Waterhouse, daughter of top thoroughbred trainer Gai Waterhouse, the milliner revealed her hats can take from five hours to five weeks to complete.

'It depends on the complexity of design and construction. It all starts with a thought and endless possibilities, then the hard labour comes in,' she said.  

Nerida Winter has been the official milliner to the Australian turf club since 2003 and a regular at the Melbourne Cup Carnival – although this spring's calendar will be considerably quieter than years gone by.
