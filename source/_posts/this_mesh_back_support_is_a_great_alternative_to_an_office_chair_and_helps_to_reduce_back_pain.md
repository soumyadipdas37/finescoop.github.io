If you're working from home, then chances are you spend the majority of your day sitting in a chair that doesn't provide the best support for your back. As a result, you can finish work each day with an achy back and tense shoulders. 

If you find that you're suffering from aches and pains yet don't want to shell out for an office chair, then the £7.82 sanlinkee Mesh Back Support is being described as a great affordable alternative.  

With over 1,000 ratings on Amazon, there is plenty of praise for the 'fabulous' back support with shoppers saying it 'makes the world of difference' with 'almost immediate results'.

The top-rated sanlinkee Mesh Back Support is now reduced to only £7.82 on Amazon and shoppers are raving about its ability to ease back pain 

Hundreds of Amazon shoppers have said goodbye to backache thanks to the sanlinkee Mesh Back Support. 

An incredibly affordable solution to uncomfortable chairs, the product description states the mesh back support is 'ergonomically designed' to encourage a better posture and give good lower back support, easing aches and pains. 

The hit product, which costs £7.82 in the sale, has received an abundance of praise from those working from home, particular with those who don't want to invest in an expensive and cumbersome office chair.

'Great support for lockdown working' penned one impressed shopper. 'I don't have an office chair in my home, and due to the COVID lockdown, I've been spending 10 hours a day sat at a dining room. 

'I was considering buying an office chair as working from home is going to continue for a while - but this has been a great alternative. Excellent back support and does exactly what I'd hoped - easy to attach to the chair and the pain in my back has really eased.' 

Another agreed, adding: 'Due to the current pandemic situation, I started working from home and suddenly I started suffering back pain so sometimes I use a dining table chair, and sometimes a sofa which doesn't support my posture very well. 

'I bought this in the hopes of elevating some of the pain from the chair, and it works incredibly well. It helps to support my lower back and encourages me to sit up straight, touchwood I haven't had any pain sitting at my desk chair since buying this.'

The chair back support can be used at home, the office or even the car- providing you with lower back support and a reduction in fatigue 

Unlike regular cushions that will either go flat or slip below your back, the mesh back support will provide the support you need to maintain good posture and prevent muscle fatigue. 

The adjustable belt means you can slip it over most chairs (even car seats) while the breathable mesh fabric makes sure you're comfortable. Plus, it's even equipped with massage plastic beads to help release back pain.  

The results have been impressive, with many shoppers reporting 'almost immediate results.  

'Comfortable and sturdy, definitely helps with posture!' wrote one shopper. 'Got this for my lower back as I sit for hours during the day, definitely notice an improvement!'

Another agreed, adding: 'I use this in the car as I have a 2 hour round trip to work. This has really improved my posture while sitting. Previously I would get out of the car feeling stiff, now there is no stiffness or pain. An excellent product with almost immediate results.'
