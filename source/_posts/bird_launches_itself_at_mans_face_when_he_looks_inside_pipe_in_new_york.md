This is the amusing moment that a man gets an unexpected fright after looking for a tiny bird that had flown into a fire department water pipe.

Jonny was out on his BMX bike in Syracuse, New York, on September 26 when he saw a bird fly straight into a water pipe on the side of a building.

He was intrigued by the bird's unusual nesting place and decided to 'investigate' where the bird had disappeared to.

Startling video footage shows Jonny crouching down near the pipe and looking inside the hole to try and spot the tiny bird.

But much to his surprise, the bird immediately flies out of the pipe and launches itself at his face, the video shows.

Johnny stumbles backwards in shock after the bird's unexpectedly swift movement, hysterically laughing as he cannot quite believe what happened.

In the video, he is heard saying: 'Holy s**t, oh my god!'

The bird was recklessly nesting inside a fire department connection, more commonly known as the Siamese connection.

The bird was nesting inside a fire department connection, which is used by firefighters to provide water to a building's sprinkler system in case of a fire

The important water pipe is connected to the building's automatic fire sprinkler system and can be used by firefighters to connect hose lines in case of a fire.

The fire department are then able to pump water into the sprinkler system at a high pressure to put out the fire.

The amusing footage was shared on YouTube, where one viewer poked fun at Jonny, saying that 'he clearly knew something was in there'.

Speaking about the footage, Jonny said: 'I bmx a lot and on my travels today, I happened to see a bird fly right into the pipe on the side of a building and when I went to go investigate, it popped out and startled me.'Â
