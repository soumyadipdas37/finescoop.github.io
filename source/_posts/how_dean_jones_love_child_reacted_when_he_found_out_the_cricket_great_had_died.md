The mother of Dean Jones' love child says her son knew that the cricket great 'loved him' as she reveals her own 'heartbreak' over his shock death.  

Koby Dean Hamilton, 11, is Jones' son to Kerri-Anne Hamilton - the cricket star's well documented former mistress. 

Ms Hamilton met Jones when she was working at a golf day in the late 1990s and the pair began an affair.

The married father-of-two would regularly travel up from Melbourne to Sydney to see her and the couple enjoyed overseas holidays together.

But in early 2009 Ms Hamilton fell pregnant and by mid-2010 the affair had become public.

Ms Hamilton told Sydney Morning Herald she decided to speak out about her former lover's death for her son Koby.

'It's an awful time for his wife and his other kids. I'm not trying to step out of line. I want to speak to you for Koby,' she said.

'I don't want Koby to go to school and for kids to say, ''we didn't see you''. How do we know you were his son. He deserves acknowledgement.'

In the wake of Jones' passing, Koby told Ms Hamilton: 'It's OK, Mum. I know my dad loved me.' 

Ms Hamilton said the father and son spoke as recently as two days before Jones' death.

Ms Hamilton said she was 'heartbroken' over Jones' death.

Despite only meeting Koby after he was two years old, Ms Hamilton said Jones always checked to make sure the pair were okay.

He would video call his son daily and the duo would discuss all things sport. 

Ms Hamilton added Jones will always be her son's hero. 

Ms Hamilton initially shared her tale on A Current Affair in 2010 and Jones confirmed the child was his.

'Following an on-and-off relationship with a woman, a child was conceived and subsequently delivered,' he said in a statement at the time.

After a preview for Ms Hamilton's interview with A Current Affair in 2010 referenced a romance with a mystery 'retired cricketer', Jones came out to set the record straight.

'I can confirm that I am the retired cricketer referred to in the A Current Affair preview last night (Friday),' he said in a statement.

'Following an on-and-off relationship with a women (sic), a child was conceived and subsequently delivered. I can also confirm I have supported the mother and child more generously than was agreed.

'At no stage have I not met my obligations.

'My immediate aim is to seek the forgiveness and understanding of family.'

The pair were in the city as part of Star India's commentary team for the Indian Premier League, which is being played in the UAE because of coronavirus.
