Holly finished her look with dazzling diamond earrings, black heels and a sparkly clutch bag.

The former Neighbours actress styled her brunette locks into a sleek straightened hairdo and added a slick of radiant make-up.

Holly's husband Nick opted for a dapper blue trouser suit with a crisp unbuttoned white shirt for the outing. 

The couple appeared in good spirits as they shared a giggle and walked hand-in-hand.

Originally from Melbourne, Holly spent several years living in Los Angeles before settling down in London with billionaire property developer Nick.

The couple married back in September 2012 in a lavish ceremony held in Beverly Hills and are now parents to two daughters, Luka, six, and Nova, who turns three next month.

In 2019, former Neighbours star Holly spoke about motherhood and admitted she felt 'terrified' after giving birth to her eldest daughter.

Speaking during an interview on the Made By Mammas podcast, Holly said: 'At the beginning with Luka, I thought it was absolutely terrifying.

'It's like the best and worst thing to ever happen to you.'

She continued: 'It's terrifying. You're exploding with love but you don't know what you're doing. You're absolutely exhausted and fumbling around just trying to survive.'
