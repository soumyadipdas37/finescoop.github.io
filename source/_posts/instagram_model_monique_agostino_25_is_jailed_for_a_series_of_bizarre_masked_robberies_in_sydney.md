An Instagram model who embarked on a series of bizarre robberies and was caught with a knife in Target has been locked up again.

Monique Marina Agostino, 25, was originally sentenced to two years in jail after being convicted for going on a crime spree in Sydney in 2018. 

She was released on bail earlier this year while appealing against her sentence, but was arrested again in September after a warrant for her arrest was issued when she failed to appear in court over claims she breached her bail conditions. 

Before her descent from Instagram star to serial offender began, Agostino accumulated thousands of followers after sharing racy photos of her wearing bikinis on the beach and in a tight Catwoman outfit.

Agostino was a getaway driver for teenage boys who broke into an Italian restaurant

Her first foray into a life of crime came in 2018, when she became involved in a series of burglaries in Sydney's north shore.

The then 22-year-old became getaway driver for teenage boys who robbed an Italian restaurant and tried to break into a fruit shop and cafe.

The crew donned black masks and used chisels to break into the Pound of Pizza restaurant at Killarney Heights on November 6. Their efforts were caught on CCTV. 

On the same day, Agostino was also caught using a stolen credit card to buy $11.55 worth of fast food from McDonald's in Brookvale.

The card had been reported stolen from the Stanley Street Cafe at St Ives earlier that day.

She was also convicted of stealing a $90 jacket from Supre, and possessing a knife and drugs - meth and diazepam - inside Target in Blacktown's Westpoint Shopping Centre.

Agostino was released on bail earlier this year as she awaited an appeal on August 26 over the severity of her sentence. 

The appeal was subsequently thrown out when she failed to show up to her court appearance in July.

She was arrested on September 5 after an arrest warrant was issued.

Agostino did end up getting her appeal heard and she was re-sentenced in the NSw District Court, news.com.au reported.

Her lawyer Pawel Kulisiewicz told the court 'they were always going to get court' and dismissed her offending as 'amateur hour'. 

Judge Dina Yehia agreed to cut her prison time in half.

The 25-year-old was handed a 12-month sentence with a six-month non-parole period, meaning will be eligible for release from Sydney's Silverwater jail in October on time served.
