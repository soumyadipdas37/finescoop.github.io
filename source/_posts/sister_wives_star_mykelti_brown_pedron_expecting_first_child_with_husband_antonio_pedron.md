Reality world: Sister Wives, which premiered on TLC in September 2010, follows the polygamist lifestyle of Kody Brown and his four spouses: Robyn, Meri, Christine and Janelle: they are pictured together in Las Vegas in April 2012

Family matters: Mykelti is the daughter of Kody and Christine Brown

Sister Wives, which premiered on TLC in September 2010, follows the polygamist lifestyle of Kody Brown and his four spouses: Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn. 

The five parents have stated that they decided to participate in the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices.  

Kody has maintained the arrangement is legal because he's only legally married to Robyn, while he's described the other three marriages (Meri, Janelle and Christine) as 'spiritual unions'.

In all the four different unions have produced 18 children, which includes three adopted kids.     

The countdown: The couple are expecting their bundle of joy in March 2020
