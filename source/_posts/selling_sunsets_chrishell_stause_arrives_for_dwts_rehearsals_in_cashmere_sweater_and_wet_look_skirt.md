The Selling Sunset reality star, 39, carried her dance clothes in a large cloth tote in one hand and had a black designer purse in her other.

She wore black heels and her long hair was loose and sleekly styled.

Chrishell is paired with dance pro Gleb Savchenko, 37, in season 29 of the ABC dance competition.

The two performed a tango on Monday night's season premiere which left judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough somewhat unimpressed. They gave the couple a score of just 13 points out of a possible 30.
