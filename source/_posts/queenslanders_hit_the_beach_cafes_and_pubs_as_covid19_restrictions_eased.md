Queenslanders are stepping outdoors into a sunny new reality with the state on the cusp of being COVID-19 free.  

Only three new coronavirus cases were reported on Saturday after three consecutive days of zero new infections.

The low figures have prompted health authorities to ease restrictions on gatherings in the Gold Coast and West Morton government areas.  

Residents can now gather in groups of 30 and also visit aged care centres. 

Queenslanders seemed to immediately enjoy their newfound freedom and have spent their days outdoors and sipping cocktails at bars.

Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young has even encouraged Queenslanders to get outdoors, and open the windows of their homes.

'Try not to shut yourselves in with air conditioning, remembering of course that we also need people to be cool,' Dr Young said.

'But wherever possible I strongly recommend that people move their lives, as much as possible, outdoors.' 

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has also promised more restrictions will be eased from October 1. 

Restaurants will be allowed to seat one person every two squared metres instead of every four squared metres.

Stadium capacities will be increased from 50 to 75 per cent.

Outdoor school and sporting events will also be capped at 1,000 people, up from 500.

More people will also be allowed to visit theme parks and zoos at one time.  

'We are able to do this because Queenslanders have done such a great job… now we can help the economy recover more,' Ms Palaszczuk said. 

The new found freedoms come five weeks after a new virus outbreak began at a Brisbane Youth Detention Centre, which peaked at 55 cases. 

The Queensland and New South Wales border could also remained closed as a new locally acquired COVID-19 case was recorded in Sydney.

The new case comes as NSW reached reached 17 days of the 28 days required for a border to reopen.

The potential setback comes as Ms Palaszczuk urged the federal government not to withdraw the Australian troops from the state's borders, including airports, on October 1.

Ms Palaszczuk says her state is being singled out as troops will remain on the borders of NSW, South Australia and the Northern Territory well into October.

'Treat Queensland like everyone else. Stop singling Queensland out,' the premier said.

Queensland had just five active virus cases on Friday morning, and if no new community transmission is recorded overnight it will have gone 16 days without such an infection.

Two new cases emerged on a ship off the coast of Cape York, but they won't be counted until they enter Queensland.
