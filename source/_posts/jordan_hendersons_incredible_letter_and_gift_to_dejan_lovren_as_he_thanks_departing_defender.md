Jordan Henderson has again underlined why he is regarded as such a great leader at Liverpool with thoughtful gift and letter to Dejan Lovren. 

Lovren left the Reds in July as he joined Zenit St Petersburg having helped play a part in Jurgen Klopp's side win the Premier League and Champions League the year before. 

The Croatian posted images revealing Henderson's touching gesture, aimed at ensuring his former team-mate feels proud of he achieved at Anfield and remembered by all those who remain. 

Jordan Henderson sent this replica Premier League trophy to former team-mate Dejan Lovren 

The names and numbers of every member of the title winning squad are engraved on it

Henderson sent a replica Premier League trophy with the name of every player in the squad engraved but it was his letter that added a personal touch. 

He wrote: 'Dej, it is impossible to think about Liverpool without you being here with us and to be honest it hasn't really sunk in yet you're not coming back. 

'You have been such a massive figure in our team and one of the biggest influences in helping drive us to the point we are at now, winners and champions. 

Clearly the gesture meant a lot to Lovren, who has since moved to Zenit St Petersburg

'I hope you realise that in the game you are rightly considered one of the best in the world at what you do. For us and Croatia you instilled a mentality within the dressing room of always keep fighting. 

'Even in times where it was tough for you, you were still there for everyone else. I will never forget the support you gave me and the difference you made in helping lead this team. You were always a 'captain' yourself, without ever needing an armband, we all look up to you.

'Off the pitch, you were one of the biggest characters I shared a dressing room with. Every player - no matter where in the world they came from or their circumstances, could connect with you. It is an unbelievable human quality. 

'I miss you already, even though I keep expecting you to bowl back into Melwood and be in the middle of banter and discussions. I hope you realise how much we all appreciate what you gave for this club and us as a team. I can't thank you enough and I am always available if you or your amazing family need anything. 

'Good luck for the future but know you still have brothers in Liverpool if you ever need us. YNWA. Hendo.'
