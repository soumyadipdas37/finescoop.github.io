Two beach huts with breathtaking sea views have both gone on the market - but there's a gulf in price. 

An idyllic wooden hut on the sandy peninsula of Mudeford, Dorset, is being sold for an eye-watering £330,000.

Whereas an isolated timber cabin overlooking the Irish Sea on the Cumbrian coast has been snapped up for a mere £3,000.

The striking difference in value appears to lay bare the well-chronicled North-South divide, a thorny issue in Britain.

Although the humble Cumbrian cabin's aesthetics are more modest than the pretty beachfront Dorset hut, it has fetched a 100 times less from an anonymous buyer.

Whereas an isolated timber cabin (right) overlooking the Irish Sea on the Cumbrian coast has been snapped up for a mere £3,000

Located just outside the village of Silecroft, the 6ft by 13ft timber hut is surrounded by a 1,000 sq ft stock-proof fence.

It does not have running water or electricity but provides opportunities for a revamp if the owner wishes to deck it out with home comforts.

However, like many beach huts, one is not allowed to spend the night. But it still attracted a flurry of interest from potential buyers when it went on the market with H&H Land & Estates. 

Katie Hunter, chartered surveyor for H&H Land & Estates, said: 'This is a really unusual and exciting property, offering so much for such a reasonable price.

'In the area there are a number of beautiful coastline walks, in both northerly and southerly directions, and the beach hut itself offers a lot of potential to upgrade and modernise, subject to planning permission.

'Given the year we have all had and the way Covid-19 has affected many people's lifestyle choices, we always expected this beach hut to tick so many boxes for those seeking outdoor space in peaceful, scenic settings.'

Number 216 beach hut is kitted with hot water, a gas cooker and a fridge freezer run off solar panels on the roof. The blue structure can comfortably sleep four people and has a mezzanine level accessed via wooden stairs

Its asking price of £330,000 would be enough to buy a detached three-bedroom bungalow in Cumbria, complete with stunning country views

But despite the evident attraction of the cabin, it sold for a fraction of the asking price for the Mudeford hut.   

The remote strip of land in Mudeford in Christchurch Harbour is home to about 360 privately-owned huts that have soared in value over the last 10 years.

The sandy spit is said to be so in demand because of its isolated location - cars are banned and it can only be reached by a 30-minute walk, a ride on a land train or a short ferry crossing.

However its location is not the sole reason it beats the Cumbrian cabin for price - it also does not hamstring the owner with overnight rules and lack of technology.

It is on the market with Denison's Estate Agents of Christchurch, Dorset. Andy Denison said: 'This year we have seen a rise in the beach hut sale prices of around 10 per cent from the period of 2019.

'Continue demand drives the prices up although, as the season starts to close down, the heat in the market has been lifted.

'Why Mudeford Spit? It is a place to escape and offers a simple way of living.

'This year has seen more and ore people working remotely and they have more time to enjoy the beach life.'
