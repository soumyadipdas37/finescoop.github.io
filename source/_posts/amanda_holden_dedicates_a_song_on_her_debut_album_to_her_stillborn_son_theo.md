Amanda Holden has revealed she's dedicated a song on her solo album to her late son Theo.

The Britain's Got Talent judge, 49, will try and conquer the charts with her debut effort Songs From My Heart after signing a reported £1 million record contract, and explained that the song With You is a tribute to her son, who was stillborn in 2011. 

Amanda announced her album plans after releasing a cover of the ballad Over The Rainbow in May to raise money for NHS charities, which soared to number one in the charts.

Exciting: Amanda Holden, 49, has revealed she's dedicated a song on her debut album Songs From My Heart to her late son Theo ahead of its release this month

Amanda told The Mirror: 'The last lines of this song are ''You took my life with you, Took my world with you'' and so this is for Theo, our baby who was born sleeping and for Chris who stayed strong when I fell apart.

'It was Chris who told me he always thought of Theo when he heard this song which floored me so it's also his song for Theo.

'It's very emotional to sing this song but I think you get chosen for experiences like that only if you are strong enough to deal with it. And it changes you.'

Amanda added that the song With You - which is released this weekend - is also Simon Cowell's favourite song from her album.

The mother-of-two was first inspired to record an album after she and her daughters Lexi, 14, and Hollie, eight, recorded a cover of The Greatest Showman hit Tightrope for her husband Chris Hughes to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. 

Amanda also revealed that she collaborated with Sheridan Smith for one of the songs on the album, after signing with Universal to record her first album.

Back in May Amanda topped the charts with a cover of The Wizard of Oz hit Over The Rainbow, which raised thousands for NHS Charities Together. 

In July Amanda spoke candidly about the devastating moment she learned there was no heartbeat when she was pregnant with her baby son.

Speaking on BBC's Dear NHS Superstars special, the star explained that she chose to have a C-section and initially thought she would not be able to hold her baby after he was born.

She said: 'I kept saying, "I can't hold a dead baby." I was absolutely terrified. Just as baby was going to come out my husband Chris had to leave the room, he couldn't bear it. 

'Jackie [her midwife] wrapped him up and I said, "Jackie, I can't do it, I can't hold him." Jackie said, "he's absolutely gorgeous, you need to see him."

'That's when I held him even though he was fast asleep. The one thing I remember is his perfectly formed eyebrows, which all my children have.'

Amanda became emotional as she remembered the moment and said she and Chris were given 'keepsakes' of Theo to take home with them.
