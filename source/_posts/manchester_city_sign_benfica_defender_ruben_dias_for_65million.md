Manchester City have sealed a £65million deal for Benfica defender Ruben Dias

Manchester City's Nicolas Otamendi will go the opposite way for a separate fee of £13.7million

In the first statement, Benfica said they had 'reached an agreement with Manchester City for the sale of all the rights of central defender Ruben Dias for the amount of 68million euros, plus an additional amount of 3.6million euros, depending the achievement of goals related to the English club's sports performance.

Pep Guardiola is desperate for defensive reinforcements after City's 5-2 loss against Leicester

Dias captained and scored for Benfica in their 2-0 win over Moreirense on Saturday before hugging sporting director Rui Costa as he said his farewells. 

Talking to Benfica TV afterwards, the 23-year old said: 'This was a special moment for me and I think everyone understands why. I'm very happy of course, it was a very important game for me and being able to mark this game with a goal was very special. I believe that everyone already has an idea of why I hugged Rui Costa.' 

Otamendi, 32, is expected in Lisbon on Monday.

Benfica coach Jorge Jesus said: 'He's a player we're sorry to see go, he came through the academy, is our captain and plays for the national team. Otamendi is a player we'd like to have. Though the player who joins us will have to understand that my ideas are completely different from those at Manchester City.'

Meanwhile, Barcelona are still interested in Eric Garcia, but will have to offload a player first

City moved for Dias after growing frustrated by Sevilla's valuation of Jules Kounde.   

Meanwhile, Barcelona remain interested in City defender Eric Garcia though may have to sell Jean-Clair Todibo before they can bid. Todibo has attracted interest from Everton and Fulham. 

Barcelona have agreed to pay £18m to Ajax for right back Sergino Dest. The deal put paid to the chance of Norwich City defender Max Aarons joining Barcelona though he has interest from Bayern Munich.
