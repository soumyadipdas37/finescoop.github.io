A British photographer has been quizzed by police after a Russian model drowned in the Mediterranean Sea during a 'paradise' glamour shoot.  

Galina Fedorova, 32, was found dead after she and Yev Taranovs reportedly stopped for a swim as they travelled to a remote island in Sardinia in a hired inflatable boat.

The dinghy, which was allegedly full of bottles of alcohol, came away from its anchor as they swam and was carried towards a rocky reef at Isola Rossa by the current, the Sun reported.

Taranovs claimed the pair had attempted to swim towards the boat, but Ms Fedorova was soon swept out of his sight as the events unraveled on Saturday.

Her body was recovered from the water by coastguards soon after.

The photographer - who earlier posted on Instagram about the 'paradise' trip - has since been questioned by police who seized a drone used in the shoot.

Sources reportedly from Italian police said the drone footage was of interest as the tragedy took place near to a Nato firing range.

'We have to make sure the assignment was not a cover for a spying mission,' an insider allegedly added.

Friends of Ms Fedorova, who has 102,000 Instagram followers, broke the news of her death on social media. A postmortem found she died by drowning.

'Sorry to say but Galina got into an accident in Italy and it didn't end well,' a post read. 

Ms Fedorova, from Moscow, has modelled for the likes of Playboy. 

Taranovs, 42, who has lived in Riga, Latvia and Twickenham, was reportedly treated for shock following the incident.

In a statement, a police spokeswoman said: 'The current took the boat towards the reef and they tried to swim towards it but were unable to reach it.'
