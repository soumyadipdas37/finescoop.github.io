Here, recap Sportsmail's IEUAN IVETT coverage from Monday night's Nations League action, with full commentary of Holland vs Italy. 

Host commentator

Well, some of that was quite dramatic! Italy put on a fantastic performance and deserved more than a 1-0 lead. Nicolo Barella's first half header was enough for Roberto Mancini's side. 

Elsewhere, Scotland held on for a 2-1 victory over Czech Republic whilst Northern Ireland were battered by Norway 5-1.

Holland 0-1 Italy

Czech Republic 1-2 Scotland

Northern Ireland 1-5 Norway

That would have been sensational. Martin De Roon clips the ball into Memphis Depay, who goes for the acrobatic attempt but he can't direct it goalwards. 

Swiftly after, Moise Kean has the chance to put the match to bed but he can't convert from the tight angle. Five added minutes.

A big penalty shout for Holland. The ball is bouncing around the box and Dumfries hits the deck but the referee does not award a spot kick.

Holland almost fashion a chance for Frenkie De Jong, but the ball just runs away from him at the crucial moment. Five minutes left. 

Holland 0-1 Italy

Czech Republic 1-2 Scotland

Norther Ireland 1-5 Norway

Memphis Depay is trying all he can to get past the resilient Italian defence, but Giorginio Chiellini sniffs out the danger. Up the other end, Insigne has yet another chance that goes slightly wide. Holland have to push now in search on an equaliser.

Italy remaining on top in this match as we enter the final 15 minutes. Lorenzo Insigne is at the heart of everything for the Italians as Holland look out of ideas in Amsterdam.

CLOSE! Yet again, Italy get in on the left side as Ciro Immobile sets up Moise Kean inside the box, but his curling effort skims past the post. Close from the youngster.

Italy are getting far too much respect and space down the left side. Lorenzo Insigne is having a field day running at the Holland defence. This time, he tees up Barella but his effort is blocked. Immobile has a chance at the back post from the resulting corner but he scuffs his chance.

Close for Holland. Memphis Depay lines up a strike and powers it towards the top left corner but it goes just wide. Dutch enjoying more possession now.

Donny van de Beek is off and is replaced by Tottenham's Steven Bergwijn.

Erling Braut Haaland nets another fantastic goal. He finds himself one-on-one and he blasts the ball into the top corner to make it five for the visitors.

Almost from van de Beek. It's the Man United man's first sight of goal, as he is found inside the box from Promes however he can't guide his effort past the goalkeeper.

That would have been delightful. A deft touch from Barella sets up Insigne outside the box, who forces a save from Cillessen. Second half has continued in the same fashion, with Italians on top.

Scotland have taken the lead against Czech Republic. Ryan Christie finished from the spot as Steve Clarke's men complete their comeback.

A miserable evening for the hosts. Erling Braut Haaland uses his pace to get behind the defence and rolls the ball to Sorloth for the easy tap-in. Could be a long second half...

All the Nations League matches are back underway for the second period.

Holland 0-1 Italy

Czech Republic 1-1 Scotland

Northern Ireland 1-3 Norway

What a great team goal! Italy take the lead as Nicolo Barella fires a header home from Ciro Immobile's delightful cross. Completely deserved.

Two added minutes in Amsterdam.

Donny van de Beek has looked comfortable on the ball when he has had possession. Looking like United have a real all-rounder on their hands.

Meanwhile, Zaniolo can't continue with injury and Moise Kean replaces him.

JUST WIDE! Lorenzo Insigne is looking very dangerous for Italy. He cuts inside off the left wing and curls a delightful effort towards the back post. It goes inches, or potentially even centimeters wide.

First chance for Holland! Liverpool's Gini Wijnaldum dribbles past several Italy midfielders and defenders to make some space for the shot from 20 yards out, but Donnarumma clutches onto the ball easily.

The Italians are continuing to look on top in Amsterdam. A few minutes ago, they got in behind the Dutch defence once again but Ciro Immobile's effort was blocked in the nick of time. Up the other end, Chiellini is showing his defensive prowess to deal with Memphis Depay.

GOAL for Scotland! Lyndon Dykes scores for the visitors and levels it for the Scots. The international new comer smashes the ball into the roof of the net.

It's a third for Norway inside 20 minutes. Alexander Sorloth meets Haitam Aleesami's cross at the back post to give the visitors a two-goal cushion. 1-3 Norway.

CLOSE! Ciro Immobile times his run perfectly behind the Holland defence, who sets himself and tries to beat Cillessen at his far post. It goes just wide.

That would have been special! Spinazzola chips in a wonderful cross to the back post for Italy and finds Zaniolo, who tries a spectacular bicycle kick that goes just over.

Italy attacker Lorenzo Insigne unleashes a shot from range and forces a great save from Jasper Cillessen. Then, up the other end the Dutch have a penalty shout waved away after Memphis Depay hit the ground.

It isn't going well for the home nations as Scotland now find themselves 1-0 down as Czech Republic take the lead. Jakub Pesek the scorer after a through ball split the Scots defence open.

Holland are having to deal with a more intense high-press from Italy than against Poland a few days ago. Both of these sides like to operate with plenty of possession. Still no chances yet, been a tactical fight thus far.

Wow. I need a breather! Erling Braut Haaland, I mean... wow! Immediately after the hosts equalise, the Dortmund striker showcases his world-class ability with a delightful curling effort on the half volley outside the box to restore Norway's lead. Effortless and pure class.

Well, it's all going on in the Northern Ireland game! Paddy McNair pounces on a rebound and it's 1-1. Crucial goal for the hosts, game on.

It's been a midfield battle for far between Holland and Italy. The Italians won a corner but of course Virgil van Dijk deals with the danger smoothly. 

A terrible start for the hosts! Northern Ireland are already one down after Mohamed Elyounoussi got on the end of Stefan Johansen's cross. 1-0 Norway.

The hosts get us going at the Johan Cruyff Arena.
