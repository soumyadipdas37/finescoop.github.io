Former Victoria's Secret model Georgia Fowler became a household name strutting the runway for the upscale lingerie brand.

And on Wednesday, the 28-year-old proved she certainly doesn't need a catwalk to ensure all eyes are on her.  

Georgia looked absolutely breathtaking when she slipped into a skimpy black thong bikini while out at a Sydney beach.

The New Zealand-born model flaunted her curves in a strapless black bikini top, which featured a pair of matching bikini bottoms. 

The swimwear, by designer Devon Windsor, featured long black gloves. The beauty had her flat stomach and endless pins on full display. 

'[Enter Bond quote],' Georgia humorously wrote in the caption. 

Earlier this month, Georgia revealed her skincare secrets while interviewing on the Mamamia podcast, You Beauty.

She explained that she never thought about skincare until she got older. 

'Growing up I didn't do much, you know I was brought up in New Zealand, and my mum was very no fuss and only used one moisturiser,' she said. 

Georgia said that she credits her skin to a number of beauty products from cleansers to sunscreen.

Georgia's favourite cleanser is the Royal Fern Cleansing Balm which retails for $114 as it 'gives a nice cleanse without drying out your skin too much'.

She also said that she uses an exfoliant everyday, to help with 'blackheads and any impurities'. 

When it comes to her favourite serum, the model revealed that her sister turned her onto the $148 Emma Lewishan Skin Reset serum which helps in 'getting rid of any pigmentation'.

Georgia also credits the importance of massaging face oils in to your skin to help reduce puffiness. 

'It really does helps bring all the blood to the face and gets rid of any excess fluid that's sitting around or puffy eyes and it's a really good practice,' she added. 

And, of course, sunscreen is a must with the model using two different types, including Dermalogica tinted sunscreen and the Rationale Beautiful Skin Superfluid.
