She's a hugely successful model who's been wowing audiences with her appearances on the catwalk. 

And Joan Smalls nailed off duty chic as she stepped out in a casual ensemble amid Milan Fashion Week on Thursday.

The Puerto Rican beauty, 32, stunned away from the runway in a black printed T-shirt by L'art de L'automobile and pale cropped jeans as she made her way around the Italian city.

Joan looked at ease as she strolled along in her stylish T-shirt, with the design at the back depicting a Ferrari on fire.

The beauty paired her T-shirt and jeans combo with box fresh white trainers, while she carried her essentials in a white handbag. 

Joan swept her brunette tresses into a high ponytail, while she stayed protected by donning a pink face mask.

The model turned the streets into her runway as she confidently strutted before making her way into her accommodation.   

Joan is currently taking part in Milan Fashion Week, after wowing during London's virtual event last week.  

Milan is only one of the four fashion capitals that is hosting the catwalk showcases with a few adjustments in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

The city is hosting 23 shows over the next five days- a move which sets them apart from New York and London, who have both held virtual fashion weeks.

Paris has 20 scheduled shows planned next week but coveted guestlists have been reduced dramatically, in keeping with strict socially distancing guidelines.

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Back in February, Georgia Armani cancelled his show in Milan as the virus began to sweep through the country.
