Rochelle shared a glimpse of her evening look as she posed in her bathroom in the classic grey shirt dress.

The star - who is due to give birth to a baby boy next month - accessorised her look with a blue ruffled clutch bag as she posed for the snaps.

Earlier in the week Rochelle celebrated the beginning of her maternity leave after a busy few weeks, which included guest-hosting This Morning during the summer break.

Last week Rochelle reflected on how her body has changed since learning she was pregnant with her third child.

Speaking to The Sun on Sunday's Fabulous magazine, she said: 'These boobs have grown out of nowhere! They're just massive! I don't know what to do with them. I've got back ache constantly and I didn't have that before.

'With my first two pregnancies, my boobs grew, but not like this. This is a whole new thing. Even though it's the third time, I'm definitely just getting used to this new body.'

Rochelle also joked that while she may have been suffering with the changes, her husband Marvin is pleased. 

She said: 'I mean, of course he's pleased, but he needs to calm down.'

Rochelle and Marvin married in 2012 at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, and they share daughters Alaia-Mai, seven, and Valentina, three.
