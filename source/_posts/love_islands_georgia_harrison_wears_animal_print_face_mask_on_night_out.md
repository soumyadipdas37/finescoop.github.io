She's no stranger to turning heads, both on-camera and at high-profile events.

And Georgia Harrison ensured all eyes were on her as she enjoyed a night out at Amazonico London in Mayfair on Monday.

The Love Island star, 25, proved safety comes first as she sported an animal print face mask, which coordinated with her matching bralet.

Amping up the glamour, the former PA stunned in a cream suit, which featured 70s-inspired trousers and a tuxedo blazer which she draped across her shoulders. 

The TOWIE star boosted her frame in multi-coloured pointed heels and accessorised with dainty jewellery.

With her blonde locks worn in a straight fashion, the online influencer highlighted her features with heavy strokes of make-up.

Georgia first found fame with a brief stint on The Only Way Is Essex in 2014, before becoming a household name with an appearance on 2017's Love Island.

The bubbly reality star then gained an American fanbase when she starred in series 33 of The Challenge in 2018, reaching the final and finishing in eighth place.

The Challenge saw reality stars from around the world come together to compete in a series of physical and mental challenges in the hope of the scooping prize money.

During her time on the show she was involved in a tumultuous relationship with fellow Brit and Ex On The Beach star Stephen Bear, a storyline that dominated much of the series.

A year later, Georgia's quest for love continued as she signed up to Celebrity Ex On The Beach.

She was previously in a relationship with Sam Gowland, who starred on the same series of Love Island as her and then went on to have an on-off relationship with Chloe Ferry on Geordie Shore.
