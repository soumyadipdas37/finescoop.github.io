The Block was brought to a grinding halt in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.

And on Monday's episode, filmed just days before, host Scott Cam announced that production was to be shut down, in order for the teams to reunite with their families ahead of state lockdowns.

Tash broke down in tears, revealing on camera how she 'feels for everyone' during such a 's***ty situation'.

'We don't know how long we're going to be gone for. Two weeks? Two months? Two years?' Tash questioned.

'It's scary, it's a once in a lifetime,' she continued in between tears. 'I just feel for everyone. [It's] such a s***ty situation'.

Tash's father Harry added that the turn of events had 'absolutely floored' him. 

Emotional: 'It's scary, it's a once in a lifetime,' Tash said in between tears. 'I just feel for everyone. [It's] such a s***ty situation'

Five weeks of filming was completed, before production was shut down for six weeks.

Competing teams, their tradesman and the crew, eventually returned at the end of the first lockdown in Melbourne in early May. 

'Obviously we want to continue with this as long as we can, and it's for a very good reason,' Scott told the contestants before shutting down production.

'It's not about making a TV show, it's about keeping everybody employed... because if we go into lockdown, everything stops.'

Referencing the UK lockdown at the time, Scott added that it was in their best interests for the contestants to reunite with their families ahead of a possible lockdown in Australia.   

'Frankly that's a risk I'm not willing to take,' he said. '[The] most important thing for me is to get you guys back home to your families safely, so you can ride this out together. You need to be with your kids. You need to be with your loved ones.'

'I'm shutting it down now,' Scott concluded.   

The Block continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine
