A California man has been arrested after he allegedly attacked several people during a rally held in support of President Donald Trump on Wednesday night.

Alvin Gary Shaw, 33, confronted the small group of people during the gathering in Aliso Viejo - 50 miles south of Los Angeles - around 6.30pm. 

Shaw allegedly blew smoke in some of the supporters' faces and used his cigar to burn one person's Trump sign, according to local reports.

He also reportedly knocked three people to the ground, including an 84-year-old woman, before he was taken away in handcuffs.

Witnesses told KTLA that their two-hour event was coming to a close, when Shaw began walking over to them.

Cynthia Cantrelle-Westman told the local station that when she first saw him approaching, she thought he was coming to join the group.

'Instead, he was pretty upset and he started using profanity from the minute he arrived,' she said. 

'He kept coming over to me and getting in my face, and all I could say was the F-word.'

Witnesses say he blew smoke in their faces and used his cigar to burn one supporter's Trump sign.

That's when the altercation turned violent with Shaw accused of striking three people, aged 55, 74 and 84-year-old Donna Snow.

'He took his hand way back like he was going to punch me, and [he] hit me right across the face,' Snow, told CBS Los Angeles. 

'Broke my earrings off.' 

One of the other two victims was taken to a local hospital with a neck injury, but it is unclear how old he or she is.  

Shaw then pulled out a small pocket knife, which is when a retired police officer arrived on the scene and drew his gun.

The assailant tried to run, but was eventually forced to the ground, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

Shaw was arrested on suspicion of elder abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and assault and battery.

KTLA reports that he was released from jail on Thursday after posting bail.   

'This could have been a very serious incident,' Sgt Dennis Breckner told CBS Los Angeles. 

'In this case, this was just two groups that disagree, and while we support people and their using their First Amendment rights to put out their message, we prefer that that remain peaceful.'
