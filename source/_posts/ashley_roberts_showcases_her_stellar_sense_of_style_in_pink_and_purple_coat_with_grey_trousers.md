She never puts a foot wrong when it comes to her sartorial displays.

The TV star looked in good spirits as she struck a series of playful poses while making her way home. 

Ashley also donned a black jumper for the day which she paired with grey trousers while she added height to her frame with black heels.

The former Strictly Come Dancing contestant let her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders while she also sported a pair of sunglasses.  

Last week, Ashley admitted she had been spoiled with cakes, champagne and cards from her extended family at the radio station after turning up for her role as showbiz correspondent on her 39th birthday.

The singer shared an Instagram video showing a caterpillar cake, a sumptuous-looking white chocolate creation, a bottle of Taittinger champagne and Hypnotiq fruit liqueur to kick off her day of celebrations.

The star's birthday appearance came after she revealed she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future.

Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine in July, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29.

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018.

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.'
