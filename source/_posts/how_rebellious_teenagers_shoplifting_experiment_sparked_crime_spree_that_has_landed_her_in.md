A tattooed teenager is facing serious jail time after an alleged shoplifting experiment sparked an alleged three-month crime spree.

Charity Rose Renfrey, 18, is facing 33 charges for break and enter, stealing and drug offences, among others. 

The charges come after she first caught the attention of police for allegedly shoplifting an item worth less than $150.

The Dakabin teen is in custody at the Brisbane Women's Correctional facility, where she awaits to appear before the Pine Rivers Magistrates Court via videolink on September 22.

The court heard this month Ms Renfrey previously attended Dakabin and Kingscliff state high schools before landing on the radar of Queensland Police.

Officers alleged Ms Renfrey's shoplifting on February 15 was what prompted her crime spree to snowball.

In March, Ms Renfrey allegedly committed 12 offences in a single day when she broke into a home, stole a car and then crashed it.
