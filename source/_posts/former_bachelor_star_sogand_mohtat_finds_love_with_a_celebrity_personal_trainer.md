Sogand Mohtat has finally found love, one year after failing to spark up a romance with Matt Agnew on The Bachelor.

This week, the 31-year-old debuted her new boyfriend on Instagram.

In a gushing post, the former reality star confirmed that she's now dating celebrity personal trainer Kev Toonen.

Sharing a picture of the two of them together, Sogand wrote: 'One of the most amazing things that can happen is finding someone who sees everything you are and won’t let you be anything less.

'They see the potential of you. They see endless possibilities. And through their eyes, you start to see yourself the same way.'

She added: 'As someone who matters. As someone who can make a difference in this world. If you’re lucky enough to find this person, never let them go.'

Kev is a trailer at the 98 Gym in Surry Hills, where The Biggest Loser's Steve 'Commando' Willis also works.

On his Instagram, he's pictured training a number of celebrity clients, including Candice Warner and actor Jason Fox. 

Back in March, Sogand revealed that her career as a civil engineer often intimidated men and made it difficult for her to date.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she admitted men often look at her differently after she tells them about her job.

'The amount of times I've had conversations with guys and as soon as I say "I'm a civil engineer", their face goes weird,' Sogand explained.

She added: 'The funny thing is, I only did it because I enjoy doing mathematics. I don't even enjoy working in the industry. 

'If a guy is intimidated by that, I don't want him in my life.'
