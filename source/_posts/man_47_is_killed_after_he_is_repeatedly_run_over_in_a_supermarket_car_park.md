A man has been killed after he was run over repeatedly in a supermarket car park as police launch a murder investigation.

The 47-year-old victim was pronounced dead at the scene in Dagenham, east London, after being hit five times by a car at around 11.30pm on Sunday night.

Residents saw paramedics performing CPR on the man at Whalebone Lane South as they battled to save his life.

Some locals said a burnt out BMW was found nearby, but police have not confirmed if this was involved in the killing.

Police launched a murder inquiry and say no arrests have yet been made.

A shop worker who was about to leave after a night shift saw paramedics working on the stricken man.

Shahid Khattack, store manager at the nearby Iceland that backs on to the scene, saw the victim lying in the car park after the attack.

The 32-year-old said: 'I was about to come out of the shop out the back when I saw the paramedics and emergency services.

'They were still working on him, pumping his chest, doing CPR, trying to save him. It was a shocking thing to see.

'We have a lot of trouble and threats from shoplifters, but you don't expect to see that.' 

Mr Khattack added: 'People I've spoken to who saw it said he was run over about four or five times.'

Mr Khattack said he saw two ambulances and around two police cars.

He added: 'Some people said they even saw armed police. It was crazy and all very scary.

'We weren't allowed to out the building until 2am while the car park was closed off. My shift was supposed to start again at 4am.'

The supermarket was still not allowed to open this afternoon, as forensic teams cordoned off the car park and took pictures of the area.

Another resident who did not want to be named said he heard a man groaning on the floor then looked out his window and saw the car run him over, then reverse over the victim.

The man in his 20s said: 'I heard something that sounded like someone groaning. I kept hearing it so went to the window and saw him lying, groaning on the ground.

'Then I saw a car come in and run over him. At first I was so shocked I couldn't tell what really happened, then it reversed and went "bang" straight over him again.

'I was so shocked I couldn't believe it. I was like "did I actually just see that?" I told my mum and she called the police. It was so crazy.'

Albert Allen said he also heard a man cry out in pain then saw a car speeding down a nearby road in reverse.

The 92-year-old said: 'At about quarter to 10pm I heard something, it was like a man repeatedly screaming out.

'At first I didn't think anything of it as there's often noises out there from youngsters at that time of night.

'Then at about 10pm, a car sped down the road in reverse, it came flying down really fast.'  

Enquiries to find his next of kin are still ongoing, Scotland Yard said, and a post-mortem examination is due be carried out. 

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Wrigley said: 'We believe the victim was deliberately harmed and we are treating this incident as a murder inquiry.

'We need to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious.'
