Working from home does have its perks, but you might have found that it's playing havoc with your posture. 

That's why Amazon shoppers highly recommend picking up this affordable laptop stand. Not only does the adjustable laptop stand relieve pressure on your neck and back, it's also a great space saver. 

The JUMKEET Laptop Stand is currently the number one bestseller in 'Laptop and Computer Stands' on Amazon. With over 1,600 glowing reviews, it's been described by one reviewer as 'strong, sturdy and stable - perfect for working from home during a pandemic!'

The £15.99 JUMKEET Laptop Stand is the number one bestseller in laptop stands on Amazon 

Using a laptop flat on the desk often means the screen is positioned too low, which can cause you to hunch your posture, putting strain on your neck, shoulders and lower back.

The JUMKEET Laptop Stand is an affordable and effective solution. Described by one customer as a 'great little stand for working at home,' it raises your screen to a comfortable eyeline, thereby aligning your spine and helping you to fix your posture.

In fact, it's been such as success one delighted reviewer wrote: 'Excellent Laptop Stand - One of best things I have bought in 2020! Great design, portable, light, strong and really functionally quite excellent!' 

Although it's simply designed, it's surprisingly effective. The JUMKEET stand can hold any laptop or tablet between 7-17 inches, including Apple Macbook, Macbook Air, Macbook Pro and the iPad. 

It has six adjustable angles so you can move it around to the one that suits you. The mesh metal design helps to get better airflow while the laptop is running, meaning it won't overheat. 

Many reviewers have even commented on how the stand actually saves them desk space.

One wrote: 'This is much smaller than I thought but that has made it 10x's better. Laptop has plenty of space to breath and it doesn't take up too much desk space. An excellent buy.'

The laptop stand is a popular buy when working from home, with one customer writing 'investment in this laptop stand has helped improve my posture at the desk tremendously'

This biggest benefit of the JUMKEET Laptop Stand is its ability to alleviate aches and pains. Hundreds of shoppers have raved about how it improves posture, actively taking pressure off the neck and back.

One shopper wrote: 'What everyone should have if working with a laptop. This has considerably helped my daughter who is currently working from home. It was easy to use and has allowed her posture to improve.'

Another added: 'Working from home with lots of time at my desk, my posture began to slack. Investment in this laptop stand has helped improve my posture at the desk tremendously.'

A third wrote: 'It has raised my laptop screen height to eye level (I'm 163cm so might be too low for really tall people?) and my posture has definitely gotten better thanks to this. The laptop is held in place by the flap at the bottom of the stand which is, so far, nice and sturdy.'
