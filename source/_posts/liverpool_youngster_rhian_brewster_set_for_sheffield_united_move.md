Sheffield United have been given permission to discuss personal terms with Rhian Brewster as talks continue over a deal for the Liverpool striker.

The Blades have edged ahead in the race to sign Brewster, 20, who is also wanted by Crystal Palace.

No deal has yet been agreed between the two clubs but, with ongoing discussions positive, the Blades have been allowed to negotiate terms with the England under-21 forward.

Sheffield United have made a £17m offer for Brewster and are willing to include the buyback option in the deal. Liverpool value Brewster at around an initial £20m and are keen to have further performance-related add-ons included in the deal.

Brewster impressed on loan at Championship Swansea last season, scoring 11 goals in 22 games, and is seeking regular football to continue his development.

Liverpool believe he is not quite ready for that at Anfield. But he is a highly-rated talent and popular figure among his teammates and the club’s management staff and the champions have been working to help facilitate the right move for the England under-17 World Cup winner.

Subsequently, Liverpool chiefs have been adamant Brewster would not leave on loan. They instead wanted Brewster’s suitors to make a commitment and buy him permanently to ensure he will be developed properly.
