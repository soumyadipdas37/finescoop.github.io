Former Australian Idol star Rob Mills has bravely spoken about his struggles during lockdown, admitting he used to turn to booze and even had difficulty getting out of bed.

The 38-year-old actor and singer shared how he turned his life around this week in partnership with the Alcohol and Drug Foundation's Break the Habit campaign.

Rob told Daily Mail Australia he made the conscious decision to get back on track by taking part in Dry July and cutting down on his drinking.

'Unhealthy habits': Australian Idol star Rob Mills has bravely spoken about how he overcame 'a routine of unhealthy habits' during lockdown, admitting he used to turn to booze and even had difficulty getting out of bed

'I was just going through the motions and found myself caught up in a routine of unhealthy habits of drinking more, scrolling aimlessly on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and obsessing over the solutions to COVID-19,' said Rob, who is living in Melbourne during its second lockdown. 

'None of these things were good for me. They made me feel increasingly angry at the world. A lot of days, I just didn't want to get out of bed. I couldn't see the point.'

Rob said that he reconnected with old friends to help him get by and also cut down his alcohol intake, which has helped him 'find joy again'.

'For me, drinking less was an important step in getting out of the hole I felt caught up in,' Rob said.

'Drinking less helps me feel more present, and I can't be that way when I'm smashing loads of drinks.'

He said that 'moderation is key' and that he no longer needs 'extremes' in his life.

Rob previously spoke about his decision to participate in Dry July to help raise awareness of cancer, after he lost two friends to the disease.

Posting on Instagram at the start of July, he vowed to give up alcohol for a month.

In a lengthy post, the musical theatre star said he was feeling 'sad' and tired' as he opened up about the loss of his mates.

'I'm tired. And I'm sad. There seems to be a lot of sadness around at the moment from BLM [Black Lives Matter], COVID, the arts...' he wrote.

'I lost two friends to cancer. Forty-eight and 38 years of age. Michael Falzon and Joe Sassone.'

Vowing to go 'booze free for the month', Rob asked that donations be made to the Cancer Council.

He then announced that he would also give up social media for a month or 'maybe longer' in order to shed light on youth suicide, and urged his followers to donate to The Reach Foundation.
