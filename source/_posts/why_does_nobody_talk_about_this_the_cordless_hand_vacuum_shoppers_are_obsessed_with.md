A powerful $199 handheld vacuum has caught the attention of shoppers online after a mum shared a video online demonstrating how it works.

Mum-of-two Celine shared images to a popular Australian Facebook group and said the Shark ION cord-free handheld vacuum WV203 is 'amazing' at quickly cleaning the home.

'I found a new best friend, why does no one talk about this machine?' she said.

'Bought it from Harvey Norman $199, had it [for] two days and already used it several times!'

In the video, Celine demonstrates the vacuum's two-time suction power by sucking up a microfibre towel. 

Celine said it will be handy to use in between car seats, on lounge cushions and for 'quick clean ups'. 

According to the product description on the Shark Clean website, the vacuum is lightweight, has a lithium-ion battery with a charging dock and is easy to use.

Last year it also won the 2019 Best Design award by the iF World Design Guide.

Another mum said her husband wanted to buy a Star Wars version of a similar Shark vacuum when they were in Japan (pictured)

Other social media users were intrigued by the device and were glad to hear it works well at picking up pet hair.

'It looks awesome, might just order one - thanks for sharing,' a woman said.

'I bought one a few months ago and love it. Did some hard bargaining and got it for $170,' another said.
