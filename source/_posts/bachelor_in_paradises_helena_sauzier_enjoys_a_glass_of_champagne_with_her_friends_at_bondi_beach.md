She is revelling in her new romance with Australian sailor, Tom Slingsby.

But Helena Sauzier spent some quality time with her friends as she shared a snap of herself enjoying a glass of champagne at Bondi Beach on Wednesday.

The former Bachelor in Paradise star made the most of the warmer weather as she enjoyed her beverage while catching up with her friends.

'Could honestly spend every day with these two and never get bored @moiramannionphysio @alexandra.sauzier,' she captioned her snap. 

This comes three weeks after the 25-year-old reality star debuted her new romance with Australian sailor Tom on Instagram.

Sharing two sweet photos alongside her beau, Helena wrote: 'You've got me hook, line, and slinger @tslingsby'.

Sorry Jamie! This comes weeks after Helena confirmed her new romance with sailor Tom Slingsby, by sharing a series of photos to her Instagram account (pictured together)

Tom shared the same smiling photo to his own account, as well as a group shot of the couple hanging out with their friends.

'So lucky to have met this one @helenasauzier,' he wrote alongside the images.

The 35-year-old sailor is the proud recipient of an Order of Australia (OAM), three consecutive world championships in sailing Laser dinghies and a 2012 Olympic Gold Medal under his belt.

It must be love: 'You've got me hook, line, and slinger,' Helena cheekily captioned the post 

Helena's new romance comes just weeks after her Bachelor In Paradise cast mate Jamie bizarrely professed his love for her, after she was booted off the show.

After saying his goodbyes to the contestants, the 40-year-old fireman said: 'I just want to say that I think over the last 10 years, I've built some walls around myself and I let those walls down.'

'I felt I came on Paradise and I opened myself up and had feelings for Helena that I've actually never felt for anyone ever in my life,' he said at the time.

He added: 'She gave me butterflies every morning when I saw her. I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna find my own version of Helena. And that's what I'm gonna take from this experience.'

Jamie also told producers he was 'happy to go home' and wasn't interested in pursuing a relationship with anyone else in the villa.

Helena rose to fame after she appeared on Matt Agnew's season of The Bachelor.
