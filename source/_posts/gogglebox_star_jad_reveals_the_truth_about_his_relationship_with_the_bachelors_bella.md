Jad Nehmetallah and Bella Varelis set tongues wagging after they were spotted out at a cafe together earlier this month. 

But the Gogglebox star has since revealed the truth about his relationship with the 25-year-old beauty, who is currently vying for Locky Gilbert's heart on the Channel 10 dating series. 

In an interview with LifeStyle, the 34-year-old explained that the two reality stars are just good friends.

'Bella and I have known each other for a while,' he told the publication. 

'And even though she's a beautiful girl, we're just mates.' 

Jad's confession comes amid reports that Bella and Jad have grown extremely close in recent months.

Earlier this month, the digital creative was spotted giggling like a schoolgirl as she and Jad left a cafe in Sydney's Burwood with fellow Bachelor intruder Bec Cvilikas, 25.  

The pair reportedly have a number of mutual friends, and have previously spent time together at events around Sydney.

While the meeting seemed innocent enough, Jad has been caught 'liking' a number of Bella's raunchy pictures on Instagram.
