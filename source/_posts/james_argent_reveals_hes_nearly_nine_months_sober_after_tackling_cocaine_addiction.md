James Argent has revealed he's nearly nine months sober after tackling his cocaine addiction.

The former TOWIE star, 32, took to Instagram on Saturday to upload a video of himself working out with personal trainer Charlotte Thorne at Gymology in Manchester.  

Arg, who recently shed two stone in two weeks after a juice cleanse, declared he's 'not looking back' and insisted he's 'really enjoying' his healthier lifestyle.

Playing Love Island star Wes Nelson's debut single See Nobody in the background, the slimmed-down singer performed a series of weighted squats and walking lunges during his session.

The media personality detailed his lifestyle overhaul in an accompanying caption, which read: 'I’ve been Healing & taken time to continue working on myself.

'Im proud to say I’m nearly 9 months clean & sober. Im really enjoying a healthy lifestyle & I’m not looking back.

'I started my fitness journey with @charlottethornefitness @gymologyuk Great workouts & I’m really enjoying pushing myself to the limit!' (sic)

Last month, James revealed he lost two stone in under a month as he went on a juice diet after treating himself to takeaways in lockdown.

The reality star, who was 18st 7lb at his heaviest, said he was encouraged to embark on a healthier lifestyle again after being left 'shocked' at pictures of himself on holiday in Spain in July.

Arg revealed he transformed his eating habits when he went on Jason Vale's retreat in Portugal after randomly bumping into the health and fitness guru, 51.

The TV star told The Sun on Sunday: 'I met Jason on the off chance and he called my bluff when I said I’d book in. So the next day I bought my flights and flew to his resort in Portugal. All I drank for a fortnight was juices.  

'I feel incredible and I’m determined to lose even more weight. I saw pictures of myself on the beach when lockdown ended and I came to Spain. I was shocked by how I looked. Now I just never want to go back to feeling that way.' 

'It was the best thing I’ve ever done. I’ve struggled with my weight for years but this has really changed my outlook. I’m free from drink and drugs still, which is a huge achievement. And making sure I lose weight and get healthier is an ongoing goal.' 

The singer had previously insisted the secret behind his epic five-stone weight loss was low-calorie curry.

Last year, he suffered two near-fatal overdoses at his home, with his then-girlfriend Gemma Collins calling emergency services after his family feared he was dead. 

The Essex native turned his life around and is continuing his recovery after he flew to Thailand earlier this year to go to rehab for his drug and drink addiction.
