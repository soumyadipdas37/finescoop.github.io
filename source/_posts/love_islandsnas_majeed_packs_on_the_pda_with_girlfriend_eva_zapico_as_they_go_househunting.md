They waiting six months before finally making their romance official.

And Love Island's Nas Majeed and Eva Zapico couldn't hide their love for one another as they went window shopping for a house in London on Tuesday.

The builder, 24, and recruitment consultant, 21, packed on the PDA as they stepped out together, eight months after meeting in the ITV2 villa.

Documenting their outing with a slew of selfies, Nas opted for an oversized grey jumper and ripped black jeans as he headed out with girlfriend Eva.

Meanwhile Eva displayed her eye-catching curves in a loose black t-shirt and form-fitting khaki leggings as she excitedly leapt on Nas' shoulders.

The couple seemed to be as in-love as ever despite months being holed up in lockdown as they perused some of the homes on offer.

Hilarious: Eva left Nas struggling to stay upright as she leapt on his shoulders during their romantic outing

In July, Nas revealed he'd finally asked Eva to be his girlfriend, during a cosy date at Jin Bo Law in central London.

Confirming the news with fans on Instagram, the reality star shared a sweet snap from their romantic evening, which he captioned: 'Officially a couple #securedthebag #trustinyoursauce.' (sic)

An excited Eva uploaded an identical image to her social media platform, which she captioned: 'I'VE GOT A BOYFRENNNNNNNN.' (sic)

Say cheese! The pair documented their romance with a slew of loved-up selfies as they enjoyed a stroll in the sunshine

The social media influencer was kicked out of the Love Island villa ahead of the final alongside her beau when he dumped eventual runner-up Demi Jones.

Ahead of his exit, Nas apologised to Demi, 21, for ditching her in favour of Eva, shortly before she embarked on a romance with Luke Mabbott and finished in third place behind Luke Trotman and Siannise Fudge and Paige Turley and Finley Tapp.

The Londoner shared at the time: 'I know its obviously tricky the way things panned out, but I genuinely wish you all the best and I do apologise for probably the way I have gone about it.'

Responding to his apology, style adviser Demi said: 'Obviously, I was upset with what happened, but everything happens for a reason.'

At last! In July, Nas revealed he'd finally asked Eva to be his girlfriend, six months after they'd first met in the Love Island villa

The pair shared they were exclusively dating and had met each other's parents just weeks after leaving the series.

Speaking to BBC Radio 1's The Reality Tea podcast in March, Nas said: 'We're exclusively dating.

'She's met my parents... She met my family and the first thing she said was: "Oh, hello, auntie."

'And obviously, to us, to me that was a massive, a massive thing. My family said: "She's so respectful. she's so lovely."'
