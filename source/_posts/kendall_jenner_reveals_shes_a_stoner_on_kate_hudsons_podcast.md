Kourtney and Oliver: Jenner, 24, and her half-sister Kourtney Kardashian, 41, appeared on Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson's Sibling Revelry podcast, which was recorded before the COVID-19 lockdown

'I am a stoner. No one knows that, so that’s the first time I’ve ever really said anything out there,' Jenner said. 

Jenner didn't say more about her 'stoner' habits on the show, but the siblings did reveal that Kylie is the most laid-back of the Kardashian-Jenner siblings.

'Kylie is very non-judgemental,' Kourntey said, while confirming that it was their mother Kris Jenner that came up with the idea to do their show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which is ending after its 20th season in 2021.

'Kim, Khloe and I were trying to do a show about.... this producer came to Kim and we were trying to do a show about our stores, Dash,' Kourtney began.

She added that,  while they started filming the footage with the stores, they started filming scenes with the family at dinner, adding, 'I think they just decided to do a family show.'

When asked if they look back at older episodes, Jenner said she will only watch if it's a 'really old' episode.

'Because those are like low-key home videos to us, so it's really cool for us to see those, the new ones, I don't care,' Jenner said with a laugh.

Both siblings agreed that, in older episodes, the fashion was, 'so bad,' as Jenner wondered if they will always look back at their hair and fashion and wonder, 'What was I thinking.'

As they discussed varying opinions on high-waist 'mom jeans,' Jemner added that people will look better in the clothes that they enjoy.

'I just think if you dress for your body, and you know what looks good on you... the better you feel in whatever you're wearing that translates onto other people,' Jenner said.

'You could be in some wild outfit, but if you have confidence in that outfit, people will see that,' she added.

Season 19 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians debuts September 17, with the 20th and final season of the E! series debuting sometime next year.
