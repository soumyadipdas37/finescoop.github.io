She recently returned from a sun-soaked Crete holiday with on-again beau James Lock.

And Yazmin Oukhellou is already pining for another exotic getaway as she shared a sizzling throwback bikini snap to Instagram on Thursday.

The TOWIE star, 26, stunned in a busty black two-piece as she posed for a mirror selfie, before sharing another snap of herself reclining by the pool.

Yazmin oozed confidence in the image as she showed off her sensational figure in the skimpy swimwear which featured gold hoop detailing.

The stunner ditched the accessories for the snap save for a pair of tiny diamond stud earrings.

She added to her glam look by sweeping her raven tresses into a sleek bun, while she coated her face with a glamorous palette of make-up.

Captioning the selfie, Yazmin penned: 'Take me back' as she recalled her recent getaway.

Meanwhile, it is said that Yazmin is set to appear on an upcoming episode of Celebrity Dinner Dates.

The beauty will choose three blind dates to go on, where her dates will attempt to wow her with their culinary skills. 

A source told MailOnline that talk during one of dinner dates gets a little intimate as Yazmin suggests that her date should 'have a circumcision'.

The scenes were likely filmed before her recent reconciliation with co-star beau James, 33. 

Back on: The on-again couple recently packed on the PDA during a holiday to Crete after they rekindled their romance earlier in the summer following an acrimonious break-up in 2019

The on-again couple recently packed on the PDA during a holiday to Crete after they rekindled their romance earlier in the summer following an acrimonious break-up in 2019.

Last month they confirmed they were back on while shooting scenes for the new series of TOWIE in South Woodford, east London.

A week earlier, they were seen putting on a cosy display during filming for their show, hugging and giggling as they attended a food festival in Chelmsford, Essex.

While days before that, Yazmin and James did little to dispel rumours they had rekindled their relationship as they enjoyed dinner together at Sexy Fish in London's Mayfair.

Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted in June, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'They're not officially back together but they're getting closer and everyone around them wouldn't be surprised if they got back together.

'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'
