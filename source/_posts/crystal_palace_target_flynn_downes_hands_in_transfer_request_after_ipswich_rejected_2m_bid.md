Ipswich midfielder Flynn Downes has handed in a transfer request to force a move through to Crystal Palace.

The Eagles have had two bids in the region of £2million turned down by the Tractor Boys - but Downes is determined to join the Premier League side.

And the 21-year-old has underlined his intentions by tabling a transfer request as he doubles down on his wish to leave Portman Road.

Sources claim that Downes is frustrated at Ipswich’s stance after the club told him they would not stand in his way if a Premier League club came in for him.

Lee O’Neill, Ipswich’s general manager of football operations, confirmed two bids have been rejected for Downes.

‘We have received two bids for Flynn over the last week or two but they are nowhere near the club’s valuation,’ said O’Neill.

‘Marcus (Evans, club owner] rejected them straightaway and he has spoken personally to Flynn to make him aware of the club’s position.

‘Every player strives to play at the highest level and Flynn is no different. We fully un-derstand why a move to the Premier League would appeal to him but until the club receives an offer that meets our valuation there is no decision to make.

‘We want to keep Flynn here because he is seen as a key part of our plans. We cer-tainly don’t welcome offers for him but we have to be realistic and accept that the good, young players we have here are going to attract interest.’
