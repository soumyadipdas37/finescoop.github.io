The vessel was due to set sail this afternoon for several weeks to work with a small Nato task group of other warships. 

A number of British and American F-35B stealth jets will also be onboard the aircraft carrier in the largest cohort of jets seen on a British warship in more than a decade. 

American aviators from the US Marine Corps arrived at RAF Marham last week to prepare for the role. 

The Queen Elizabeth is due to deploy on her first operational mission early next year, which will she her travelling across the world.

Her sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, is expected to undertaker its maiden operational deployment in 2023.
