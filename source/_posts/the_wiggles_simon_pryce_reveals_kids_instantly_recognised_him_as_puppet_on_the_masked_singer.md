He was revealed as Puppet during Monday's episode of The Masked Singer, but Simon Pryce said his young fans actually worked out that he was under the costume a long time ago.

Appearing on The Project on Tuesday, the 48-year-old Wiggles member confessed he had parents telling him their kids had already worked it out.

'I had parents writing to me after the first night, saying, "My three-year-old wasn't even watching the television, heard your voice, turned around and said, 'Oh, that's Simon Wiggle!'"' he laughed.

Speaking about his costume on the show, Simon revealed he never expected judge Dannii Minogue to be so scared of Puppet.

He said the hardest part about appearing on the show was 'not being able to talk to anyone', and admitted the group performance was bizarre.

'You don't know who anybody is. Then all of a sudden, when you do a group number, you're all there on stage together and you do an awkward little wave to each other,' he said.

'You can't talk. You've got all your costumes on and you stand there awkwardly looking at each other.'

The beloved children's entertainer confessed his costume was especially heavy, making it difficult for him to move and see.

'The head weighed about 20 kilos and it had a big metal bar that moulded to a brace. Every time my mouth closed, I couldn't see, because that's where my view was,' he explained. 

'Well, I'll tell you what, I will never complain about wearing a skivvy ever again!' he joked after taking off his mask. Pictured second from right with The Wiggles

And while she may not have been Puppet's biggest fan, Dannii, 48, was the only judge who guessed his identity correctly before the big reveal.

The performer admitted that the Puppet costume was a lot more restrictive than the famous red outfit he wears with The Wiggles.

'Well, I'll tell you what, I will never complain about wearing a skivvy ever again!' he joked after taking off his mask.
