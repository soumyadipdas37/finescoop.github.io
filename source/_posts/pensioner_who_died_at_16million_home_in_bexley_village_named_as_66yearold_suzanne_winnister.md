This is the first picture of a pensioner who was found dead with severe head and neck injuries in her £1.6million mock-Georgian home in London. 

Suzanne Winnister, 66, was found collapsed at the gated property in a leafy cul-de-sac in Bexley village, south-east London, on Tuesday.

She was pronounced dead by paramedics who attended the scene.

A special post-mortem investigation yesterday found she died of severe neck and head injuries, police say.

The Metropolitan Police have launched a murder inquiry, while a 68-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

A second man, aged 64, who was also arrested as part of the investigation, has been released by police under investigation.

A Met Police spokesperson said: 'The death is being treated as suspicious at this stage and a post mortem is due to be held to establish the cause of death.

'She has been named as 66-year-old Suzanne Winnister. Her next of kin has been informed.

'A special post-mortem examination held on Wednesday gave cause of death of severe head and neck injuries.

'A 68-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. He was taken to a south London police station where he remains at this time. The man and the woman are believed to be known to each other.

'A second man aged 64 who was also arrested in connection with the investigation has been released under investigation.'

It comes after the detached mock-Georgian double-gated property was cordoned off by police yesterday. 

Officers were manning a cordon at the top of Becketts Close, where the horror unfolded.

A police van was parked outside the early-2000s property. The gates were open but a cordon was draped across it.

The garage door was left open with a white Volkswagen parked outside. The house is in a side street cul-de-sac next door to just one other home in a desirable area.

There are also mock Tudor and white rendered mansions with BMWs, Audis and Range Rovers parked in the street.

One local said: 'It's such a quiet area usually - there are a lot of families and it's a good mix of people. There's no troublemakers.

'But last night there were about four police cars with their flashing lights on and an ambulance. That never happens round here.

'I couldn't believe it when I heard someone had been murdered. It's so tragic.'

Another woman said: 'It's such a peaceful neighbourhood and we all look out for each other. It's a tremendous shock to us all.'

One neighbour who lives near the property said: 'We are all totally shocked. We can't believe something like this would happen.

'It's such a nice quiet area. We don't know who the lady is but our thoughts are with her poor family.

'It's a terrible thing to happen.'

A murder investigation has been launched led by Detective Chief Inspector Mick Norman.

He said: 'We are at the very early stages of our investigation, we have arrested a man and our enquiries continue at a pace.

'Our thoughts are with the deceased's family at this sad time. I urge anyone who has information, but has not yet come forward, to get in touch without delay.'
