With golden beaches, bright blue seas and lush lemon and olive groves everywhere you look, there are few more beautiful places for a springtime trip than the Aegean. 

You’ll see its countless stunning islands as you cruise in style on this new, eight-day trip with Greek itinerary specialists Celestyal Cruises.

It’s also a haven for foodies, and your trip will be even more unforgettable in the presence of MasterChef 2019 champion Irini Tzortzoglou, who was brought up in Crete before she moved to the UK.

Magical: Oia village on the island of Santorini, one of the cruise stops

You will be joined by Irini Tzortzoglou

Irini Tzortzoglou was the 15th amateur chef to be crowned MasterChef champion when she saw off her 55 competitors to lift the trophy in 2019. 

The retired banker was brought up in Crete before moving to Cumbria and now calls the UK home. 

Irini’s first book, Under The Olive Tree: Recipes From My Greek Kitchen, is out now. 

YOUR ITINERARY

DAY 1 Arrive in Piraeus and board Celestyal Crystal DAY 2 Kusadasi, Turkey DAY 3 Rhodes DAY 4 Agios Nikolaos DAY 5 Santorini DAY 6 Milos DAY 7 Mykonos DAY 8 Return home. 

Irini will give an exclusive talk and take part in a Q&A session on board your ship, and will meet you during a private excursion to a traditional Cretan organic farm, where she’ll pass on her knowledge about the cookery traditions of the Greek island.

In what’s sure to be a memorable event, Irini will also prepare you a meal from her new cookbook, Under The Olive Tree.

On board the comfortable Celestyal Crystal, you’ll enjoy excellent service and a range of restaurants and bars, plus all-inclusive meals featuring many of the fresh Mediterranean ingredients you’ll come across during your trip.

REASONS TO BOOK

Meet 2019 MasterChef winner Irini Tzortzoglou: Irini’s food was described as ‘magical’ by MasterChef judge John Torode as she triumphed in the first-ever all-female final of the TV show. She’ll be on hand to tell you all about Cretan food during an exclusive farm visit. To celebrate the release of her first cookbook, Irini will give an interactive cookery class during your farm visit and cook you a meal from the recipes in Under The Olive Tree.

Cruise in style: You’ll feel cosy and comfortable in Celestyal Crystal’s delightful suites and staterooms and you can pamper yourself in the spa, use the fitness centre or take part in arts and crafts or dancing lessons. As well as the delicious food you will cook with Irini, you’ll enjoy all-inclusive meals aboard your ship, lovingly made by the chefs from fresh ingredients. You’ll be spoilt for choice of restaurants and bars – there’s fine dining at the Amalthia and Olympus restaurants or tasty treats from the Aura Grill, and you can relax with a drink, watching the stars in the evening from the Thalassa Bar.

Discover the beautiful Greek islands: The clifftop Acropolis of Lindos will be the thing you spot long before you arrive in Rhodes, where you’ll disembark and wander round the Old Town. The cobbles were once walked by the Crusaders, Byzantines and Romans. Agios Nikolaos in Crete is full of lively cafes and taverns and golden beaches, while visiting the volcanic landscape of Milos is an otherworldly experience. You’ll need your camera at the ready for the beautiful windmills and whitewashed villages of Mykonos.
