Brooklyn, 21, and Hana called it quits last year after eight months of dating in the wake of a string of explosive public rows.  

Back in September, reports surfaced Victoria and David were relieved when the couple split.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'Brooklyn and Hana have called off their romance for good. David and Victoria very glad and relieved and are backing him 100 per cent.'

Hana has since moved on from her turbulent romance with Brooklyn and is dating Nasser Alfallah, who is a Loyola Marymount University student in Los Angeles and is originally from Kuwait. 

And according to The Sun, the influencer is said to have started recording her debut album with savage lyrics believed to be about her ex - who got engaged to American actress Nicole Peltz, 25, last month - and their failed romance.  

The website reports that in the track, Hana sings: 'I wish that someone told me you had a habit for dishonesty . . . though you break my heart, I want to stay.'
