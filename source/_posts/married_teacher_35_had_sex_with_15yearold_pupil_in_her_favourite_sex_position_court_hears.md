A married teacher had sex with a 15-year-old student in her 'favourite' sex position and sent him topless pictures, a court heard today. 

Kandice Barber, 35, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, is accused of having 'doggy-style' sex with the teenager in a field and sending him topless pictures and a video of herself on Snapchat. 

Aylesbury Crown Court heard that the mother of three allegedly told the student that he had a bigger penis than her husband and told him she was pregnant with his baby. 

Barber is accused of having sex with him three times after initially sending him messages over Snapchat in September 2018.  

Kandice Barber (pictured arriving at Aylesbury Crown Court with her husband, Daniel), 35, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, is accused of having sex with the teenager in a field and sending him topless pictures of herself on Snapchat

Summing up the case today as the jury went out to deliberate, Judge Francis Sheridan said: 'We saw the conversation between her and her husband and what he said there about her ''favourite position'' being doggy-style.'

Juror had previously been told the boy claimed they had sex in the same position while speaking to police.  

Meanwhile, Barber had searched 'What is the name of someone you are having an affair with?' and the word 'alibi' on Google, according to The Sun.

She also searched 'a lie of where you have been' then 'good secluded areas,' and 'Holiday Inn, Wycombe.'

But the teacher claimed in evidence she was just trying to find out the name of the film Fatal Attraction and only enquired about 'secluded areas' for her dog walks. 

Aylesbury Crown Court heard that Barber (pictured with her husband Daniel) and the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had sex in a field in October 2018 after she approached him at a sports presentation evening the previous month and added herself to his Snapchat on his phone

She was arrested after the boy revealed the alleged relationship to the headteacher in March 2019 after naked pictures of Barber circulated around Princes Risborough School in Buckinghamshire, the court heard.

In her evidence, Barber said she had given the teenager her number so he could talk to her about any issues and denied the conversations were sexual.

She told the court she never sent him topless pictures of herself and claimed the My Eyes Only folder in her Snapchat had been hacked.

She said she became uncomfortable with the boy's phone calls and when she refused to have any contact with him she claimed he sent a message reading: 'Watch what's going to happen, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your family.'

In November 2018 Barber was off school for two weeks after suffering an ectopic pregnancy.

Giving evidence in court, her husband, Daniel Barber, said they had been trying for a baby around the time of the alleged offences

She denied ever telling the complainant the baby could be his, but said the fact that she had lost a baby was well known around the school.

Giving evidence in court, her husband, Daniel Barber, said they had been trying for a baby around the time of the alleged offences.

Barber denied three counts of causing or inciting a child aged under 16 to engage in a sexual act and one count of sexual communication with a child.

She has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activities while in a position of trust, and one count of causing a child to watch a sexual act by a person in a position of trust.
