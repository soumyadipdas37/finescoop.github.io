A student was left horrified after pigeons invaded his flat, destroying most of his possessions and even leaving a chick among his clothes and eggs in the kitchen sink.

Oluwageorge Johnson, 20, had to leave his student halls suddenly in March before the coronavirus lockdown. 

Last week, he received an email saying accommodation workers had found his flat covered in mess made by pigeons after going to investigate a strange noise. 

Nottingham Trent University student Oluwageorge Johnson, 20, received an email from accommodation workers to say they found pigeon droppings inside his flat 

Mr Johnson had to leave his accommodation suddenly in March due to the coronavirus lockdown and left a window open when he left

Staff found pigeon droppings inside the property, eggs in the sink and a small chick in the Nottingham Trent University accommodation in the city centre. 

Media and communications student Mr Johnson, of Enfield, north London, said: 'I just wish I hadn't seen it myself. Then I might be able to sleep at night.

'I wanted to go back to university last week but I'm going to wait a bit now. I'm never leaving a window open again. Everyone's shook.

'Coronavirus had been about so my parents turned up out of the blue to take me back home. 

'People were saying that the military had been deployed and my parents are dramatic. 

'I left my window open and I was gone for about five months. 

Mr Johnson had left some clothes in his flat and said he now has an opportunity to buy some new ones, although it's a shame some are gone

'I'd left some random stuff behind that I didn't need like a toaster and clothes that I wouldn't be wearing over the summer.'

He added: 'I had an email saying that staff had heard noises coming from my room so went to check and found the mess the pigeons had made. 

'My sneakers were covered in poo and my toaster. I'm just glad I didn't walk in and find it. That would have been horrible. 

'It's an opportunity to buy some new clothes but it's a shame that some of it's gone.'
