Queen Letizia of Spain demonstrated her sensational sense of style as she attended a meeting in Madrid today.

The royal, 48, met those who are working in the fight against poverty at The BBVA Microfinance Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has been having a social impact for more than 10 years.

She appeared effortlessly sophisticated in an asymmetrical check print dress by Spanish brand Pedro del Hierro, paired with black court heels and a coordinating clutch handbag.

Letizia has worn the timeless style on previous engagements, including celebrating the bicentennial of the Prado Museum alongside King Felipe in 2018.

Mother-of-two Letizia completed her look by wearing her hair in its signature off-centre parting along with minimal accessories.

She opted for subtle make-up and wore a disposable surgical face mask for safety, amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which has already killed over 31,000 people in Spain.

She was seen practicing social distancing as she spoke to those in attendance including the Spanish Minister of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, Teresa Ribera.

The meeting organized by BBVA, entitled 'Relentless Women: Challenges and Achievements to Rebrand Oneself during Times of Crisis', aims to analyse the situation and status of women in South America and how technology could help to solve the coronavirus crisis.

During the engagement, Letizia was given the opportunity to learn about the projects in place to offer support to those who don't have access to the conventional financial system or to obtain the necessary resources to improve their quality of life.  

Queen Letizia was told about the non-profit organisations projects for their ongoing fight against poverty 

Queen Letizia presided over the meeting which was held in a hybrid format combining virtual and face-to-face elements 

The foundation has had objectives including promoting economic and social development since its creation in 2007.

They have provided financial products and resources to entrepreneurs who lack resources, in the belief that the actions are key to generating development, mitigating poverty and its consequences.    

The entities of the BBVA Microfinance Foundation have delivered loans of over 14,500 million dollars to five million low-income entrepreneurs, creating opportunities for them to improve their living conditions within the last 10 years.

Queen Letizia appeared delighted to be given the opportunity to join the conference and took a front row seat during presentations.

She cited two women who virtually joined the meeting as being representative of the millions of vulnerable women who've been hit by the pandemic, while also seeking change in their lives.

The former journalist also highlighted the importance of 'digital transformation, investment in education and training, sustainable development'.

Queen Letizia is set to have a busy week with a meeting at the Headquarters of the Spain Mental Health Confederation among her planned agenda.
