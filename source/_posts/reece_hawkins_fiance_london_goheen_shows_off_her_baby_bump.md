Reece Hawkins' model fiancée London Goheen showed off her baby bump on Saturday.

The 22-year-old American beauty joked about struggling to wear jeans while pregnant, as she posed up in some new threads for the brand Fashion Nova. 

It comes after she was slammed for charging her followers to see photos of her baby bump on OnlyFans.

'I'm not smiling unless my pants are undone,' London captioned the photo. 

London, who boasts 515,000 Instagram followers, copped backlash after revealing she was going to be charging fans $14.99 per month on the subscription service. 

OnlyFans is a subscription-based adult website where content can range from something as innocent as a suggestive selfie, all the way to hardcore pornography. 

'She's literally charging people for her OnlyFans to view pics of her bump? What the f**k,' one follower commented on London's pregnancy announcement on Instagram.

Another wrote: 'Wow sis is really charging $9.99 per month to see her pregnancy photos lol.'

One fan said that while she's happy for influencer Reece, 25, and London, they just can't comprehend coughing up the cash for the images. 

'Congratulations. I would love to keep track of everything for your pregnancy. Just like with your relationship to watch you guys grow together... But I don't want to pay for an OnlyFans...'

However, another follower said that posting to OnlyFans is a good idea, saying it's 'so much safer and more secure!!'

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday, London defended her decision to show off her baby bump on OnlyFans. 

'I have chosen to show detailed parts of my pregnancy on that platform because I've had to experience harassment and bullying for the last two years over my relationship with Reece,' she explained.

'I have 100 per cent control of my profile and what people have access to and comment on.

'I never said it was compulsory. People can choose if they wish to subscribe or not. If people don't like the idea of it or disagree with my decision then they don't have to be involved... 

'We're just doing this to ensure a HAPPY POSITIVE FRUITFUL PREGNANCY.'

On Wednesday, Reece and London announced that they're expecting their first child together, just weeks after getting engaged.

'Been busy growing a BABY in my belly with this one wbu?' London captioned the image.

Reece also shared similar images of the pair, calling London his 'Baby Momma' and the 'love of my life.'

'Baby Momma alert. Having a baby with the love of my life and my best friend,' he wrote. 

Reece has been dating the Texas-born beauty since mid-2018, after announcing his split from ex-fiancee Tammy Hembrow, 26, after five years of dating.

Last month, Reece and London announced their engagement.

Reece shares two children with ex Tammy Hembrow, son Wolf, five, and daughter Saskia, four.
