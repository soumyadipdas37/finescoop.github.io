Sheffield United have finalised the captures of defenders Jayden Bogle and Max Lowe from Derby.

The promising full-back duo, both graduates of Derby’s academy, sealed their switches on Sunday, after completing medicals and agreeing long-term deals, leaving the Blades poised to announce their arrivals for a combined £11million.

Wilder has been looking for competition for his first-choice wing backs George Baldock and Enda Stevens.

He has now filled those gaps in his squad by securing Bogle, 20, who operates down the right and Lowe, 23, who plays down the left.

Both sat out of Derby’s Carabao Cup win against Barrow on Saturday ahead of their moves to the Blades.

Bogle and Lowe will join goalkeeper pair Wes Foderingham and Aaron Ramsdale as major additions to Chris Wilder’s squad this summer.

Winger Oliver Burke will also move to Bramall Lane from West Brom this week in a swap deal that will see Callum Robinson, who spent the second half of last season on loan at the Hawthorns, go the other way.

Sheffield United kick off their season against Wolves next Monday, with Wilder hopeful of bringing in up to five new faces before the transfer window closes on October 5.

Oliver Burke is also set for a move to the Blades this summer form West Bromwich Albion
