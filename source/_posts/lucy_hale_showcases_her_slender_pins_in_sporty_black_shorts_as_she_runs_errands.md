She appears to have increased her exercise regime in recent months during lockdown. 

And Lucy Hale displayed the fruits of her labour as she displayed her slender pins while running errands on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood on Tuesday. 

The Pretty Little Liars star, 31, wore sporty black shorts and a hoodie as she kept a low profile while taking the trash out.

In recent months, Lucy has been increasing her training regime with the help of celebrity trainer Adam Nicklas, which includes the use of resistance bands and weights.

Lucy has had more time on her hands now that her Riverdale spin-off, Katy Keene, has been cancelled by the television network, THE CW, after just one season.  

She has been very open about her disappointment over the musical comedy drama series ending 'prematurely' after stating she wanted it to continue on for many more seasons.

Most recently, Lucy starred in the romantic comedy film, A Nice Girl Like You, which was released via video on demand in July in the United States. 

She also stars in the upcoming dark comedy film, Big Gold Brick, alongside Emory Cohen, Andy Garcia, Megan Fox, Oscar Isaac, Shiloh Fernandez and Frederick Schmidt. 

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is no official word on when it will be released.
