Kylie Minogue made a serious style statement when she stepped out in London on Tuesday. 

The pop princess, 52, looked incredible wearing a blue striped maxi dress which had a split going up the front.  

She wore a £30 designer face mask by Christopher Kane and carried a Chanel mini bag across her body.

Kylie shunned her usual beloved heels for the outing and instead wore a chic pair of flat espadrille sandals which had an ankle strap. 

Her naturally curly hair was worn in an up-do and she completed her superstar look with a pair of designer sunglasses. 

It's a busy time for Kylie, who is gearing up for the release of her latest album, Disco, on November 6.

The former Neighbours actress, who lives in Chelsea with her magazine executive beau Paul Solomons, 46, has been dominating the charts since her first single, I Should Be So Lucky was released in 1987.  

Last month, the Princess of Pop detailed her experience filming the music video for her new single Say Something entirely in front of a green screen amid COVID-19 restrictions. 

'It was a different shoot with the restrictions but it felt good to be back on set,' the songstress told The Herald Sun.

In the clip, Kylie rides a horse statue as a salute to Bianca Jagger, who famously rode a white horse on the Studio 54 dance floor. 

'The horse was the star of the show. I don't think my galactic steed was designed to be ridden, but I fell in love with him, he was gorgeous,' she said. 

'I hope when people see it, it takes them to another level and away to wherever their happy place is.'

Her new project marks her 15th studio album for the artist, who has a global cult following in her native Australia and the UK.  

The album is said to be a return to form for Kylie, whose last record Golden was a country-inspired effort.

No doubt the pop star will also be gearing up to watch her ex boyfriend and former Neighbours co-star Jason Donovan on the upcoming series of Dancing On Ice. 

Jason, also 52, who competed on Strictly in 2011 - is expected to join the star-studded line-up on the ITV show which takes place in January 2021.

Her flame: Kylie is currently dating creative director for British GQ Paul Solomons, 46. The pair were first introduced through mutual friends in February 2018
