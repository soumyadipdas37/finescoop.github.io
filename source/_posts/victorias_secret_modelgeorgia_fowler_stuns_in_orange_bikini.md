Her appearances in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show have made her one of New Zealand's most successful models.

And on Tuesday, Georgia Fowler showed exactly why she's at the top of her field by showing off her incredible bikini body on a Byron Bay beach.

The 28-year-old stunned in the tiny orange two piece, which showed off her taut figure.

Georgia was slightly sunburned on her backside, but the rest of her body had a golden tan.

She was accompanied by her boyfriend, Nathan Dallah, who was carrying a surfboard.

In an interview with Mamamia this week, Georgia revealed the secrets behind her flawless skin.

A minor adjustment! The 28-year-old adjusted her bikini bottoms for a brief moment

'Growing up I didn't do much, you know I was brought up in New Zealand, and my mum was very no fuss and only used one moisturiser,' she said. 

'I learnt, obviously being in the modelling industry and having makeup artist and professionals working on my skin all day and every day, what products I should use...'

The New Zealand beauty said that she credits her skin to a number of beauty products from cleansers to sunscreen.

Georgia's favourite cleanser is the Royal Fern Cleansing Balm which retails for $114 as it 'gives a nice cleanse without drying out your skin too much'.

She also said that she uses an exfoliant everyday, to help with 'blackheads and any impurities'.

When it comes to her favourite serum, the model revealed that her sister turned her onto the $148 Emma Lewishan Skin Reset serum which helps in 'getting rid of any pigmentation'.

All smiles: Nathan giggled and laughed as Georgia sat below him in the sand 

Getting dressed: Georgia pulled up her outfit so she could cover up her bikini 

Georgia also credits the importance of massaging face oils in to your skin to help reduce puffiness.

'It really does helps bring all the blood to the face and gets rid of any excess fluid that's sitting around or puffy eyes and it's a really good practice,' she added.

And, of course, sunscreen is a must with the model using two different types, including Dermalogica tinted sunscreen and the Rationale Beautiful Skin Superfluid.

Almost done! The model finished putting on her outfit before gathering the last of her things and leaving
