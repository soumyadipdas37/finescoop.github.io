Kylian Mbappe's reported decision to inform Paris Saint-Germain that he wants to leave next summer has got plenty of people talking, none more so than the Spanish press.

According to the Times, the French World Cup winner has made clear his plans to leave PSG in the summer of 2021, putting Europe's elite clubs on hot alert - most specifically Real Madrid.

And on Monday morning, the Spanish press were quick to jump on the news and struggled to contain their excitement about the possibilities ahead.

Marca ran the headline: 'We are waiting for you Mbappe', alongside the Real Madrid badge

AS report that the French World Cup winner - a big target for Real Madrid - 'took the plunge' 

Madrid-based Marca ran with the headline alongside the Real badge: 'We are waiting for you Mbappe', after dropping the transfer bombshell on the Ligue 1 giants.

They then go on to report that Madrid will wait to see how Mbappe's situation develops over the coming year, and will not reach out straight away to PSG over a potential deal.

Meanwhile, fellow Madrid paper AS published the following headline on their front page: 'Mbappe takes the plunge.'

AS also state that Zinedine Zidane's side are set to postpone their long-running transfer interest by 12 months and make their move for the 21-year-old at the end of the campaign.

Mbappe is contracted to PSG until 2022, meaning next summer is the last opportunity for the Parisians to sell their star asset before running the risk of losing him as a free agent.

Therefore, Madrid will look to pounce and add his name to their star-studded attack as they eye European domination once more. 

PSG made a huge investment in Mbappe, signing him from AS Monaco in 2018 for a fee in the region of £165million.

The deal remains the second highest ever paid for a footballer, behind PSG's marquee capture of Neymar after triggering his Barcelona release clause.

PSG are said to have made multiple lucrative offers to Mbappe in hope of getting him to commit his future to the club, including a promise to see him as their highest ever paid player while pledging to build the team around him in future.

But the World Cup winner already has his eyes on pastures new, and it appears Madrid are front-runners for his signature.

Madrid have already drawn up a battle plan for next summer's transfer window, with Mbappe set to be the headline signing while they also target Dayot Upamecano and Eduardo Camavinga.

Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City have all been linked with Mbappe in the past too.
