The Spasskaya Tower military music festival in Russia took place online after it was cancelled due to coronavirus.

The annual international music festival in Red Square took place on September 6 with almost no spectators on the Cathedral Square in Patriot Park, outside Moscow. 

Fireworks exploded over the Cathedral of Russian Armed Forces and bands performed in front of the building. 

The festival features a combination of military, classical, folk and popular music with military band parades and dance shows. It also features laser and firework displays. 

This year, it featured a Russian navy band, military band, paratroopers as well as a performance from members of the Russian Honor Guard. 

The festival is named after the Spasskaya Tower which is the main tower on the eastern wall of the Moscow Kremlin which overlooks Red Square.
