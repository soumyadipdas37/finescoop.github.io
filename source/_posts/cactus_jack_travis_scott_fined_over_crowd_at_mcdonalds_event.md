Musician Travis Scott is being fined by the city of Downey after a rowdy crowd of 500 people turned up at a McDonald's restaurant to try his new Cactus Jack meal. 

Travis, 28, who has a daughter, Stormi, two, with Kylie Jenner, 23, has collaborated with the fast food giant and it's caused quite the frenzy.  

According to TMZ, both Travis and the McDonald's in Downey, California have been cited by the city because they didn't have permits for the gathering. 

Oh no! Travis Scott is being fined after a crowd of over 500 people queued up at a McDonald's to try his new $6 Cactus Jack meal because he and the fast-food giant failed to get a permit 

Travis reportedly failed to obtain an event or filming permit for the attendees before he showed up to greet fans who were waiting in line to try his meal.

Both citations come with $100 fines, so he and McDonald's won't be too out of pocket as they will have to stump up $200. 

Travis was mobbed a week ago when he arrived at the restaurant by fans, who the site report, many of which were not wearing masks or social distancing. 

He was forced to run for cover.    

Eat up! Fans went wild to get their hands on Travis' favorite meal— a Quarter Pounder with cheese, a medium order of fries with BBQ sauce, and Sprite — for just $6 by saying that Cactus Jack sent them

A spokesperson for Downey told TMZ: 'Cops reported about 500 people in attendance, and the PD dispatched several units to make sure the large crowd stayed safe.

'There were no injuries and it doesn't seem like any arrests either.' 

MailOnline has contacted a spokesperson for both Travis Scott and McDonald's for comment.  

The $6 Cactus Jack meal, which has to be ordered through the McDonald's app, consists of a Quarter Pounder with cheese, bacon, and lettuce, fries with BBQ sauce, and a medium Sprite. 

USA Today reported on Tuesday that McDonald's were running out of ingredients due to the demand for Travis's new meal, which sounds very similar to the usual Quarter Pounder meal.   

Snuggle up! McDonald's sold a $90 chicken nugget-shaped body pillow as part of the collaboration with Travis and people couldn't get their hands on it fast enough 

McDonald's said in a statement: 'In fact, it’s been so lit, some of our restaurants have temporarily sold out of some of the ingredients in the meal.

'We’re working closely with our suppliers, distributors and franchisees to resupply impacted restaurants as quickly as possible.'

Meanwhile, McDonald's and Travis collaborated on a new line of limited-edition merchandise that includes a chicken nugget-shaped body pillow.

The collaboration launched on September 8 and also includes T-shirts, shorts, hats, and other items, but it's the 36-inch McNugget pillow that's generating the most buzz.

And despite it's $90 a price tag — and a warning that it won't ship for nine to 12 weeks — the pillow has already sold out.

In fact, all items from the collaboration appear to have already sold out, with some already popping up on re-sale websites even though they haven't shipped yet. 

Other pieces from the collab include T-shirts, sweatshirts, and sweatpants with varying McDonald's-themed artwork.

There are also denim shorts with a Cactus Jack x McDonald's logo, another pair of shorts with an Egg McMuffin package pattern, and several caps.

For non-wearable merch, there's a $250 floor rug with a vintage McDonald's menu printed on it, a $30 lunch tray, a $45 lunch box, a $78 blanket, 10 for $25 plastic cups, and a $65 six-foot-tall cardboard cutout of the Travis Scott action figure from his 2015 album.

'I couldn't be more excited to bring the Cactus Jack x McDonald's collaboration to life,' Travis said in a press release. 'We are bringing together two iconic worlds. Including a charitable component was key for me, and I can't wait for people to see what we have in store.'

What a look! The collection also includes these Egg McMuffin shorts

Though the merch has sold out, fans can still get in on the fun by getting Travis' favorite meal at their local restaurant: a Quarter Pounder with cheese, a medium order of fries with BBQ sauce, and Sprite — for just $6.

Customers need only to say that Cactus Jack sent them, until October 4. 

'Everyone has a favorite McDonald's meal, no matter who you are,' McDonald's U.S. Chief Marketing Officer, Morgan Flatley said in a press release.

'Travis is a true McDonald's fan having grown up visiting our restaurants in Houston, not to mention one of the biggest musical acts and cultural icons in the world.   

'This is the first time in nearly 30 years we've introduced a superstar's name to our menu — we're excited to bring the Travis Scott Meal to a McDonald's near you starting next week.' 

The last time was 1992 with Michael Jordan. 

Smell that? McDonald's has sold some wacky merchandise before — in fact, the chain sold Quarter Pounder-scented candles earlier this year

Burn 'em all! The scents include bun, ketchup, pickle, cheese, onion, and '100% Fresh Beef'

For superfans: The line also included a 2020 Quarter Pounder calendar

McDonald's has sold some wacky merchandise before — in fact, the chain sold Quarter Pounder-scented candles earlier this year.

In February, the company launched the Quarter Pounder Fan Club, an offshoot of its official merchandise line, with several items that celebrate its beloved cheeseburger.

The most eyebrow-raising addition was a pack of six scented candles that each smell like a different Quarter Pounder ingredient. 

The pack includes six custom scented candles inspired by Quarter Pounder ingredients. There's one each with scents like bun, ketchup, pickle, cheese, onion, and '100% Fresh Beef.'

The idea seems to be that burning them all at once will make a room smell like a Quarter Pounder, but it also give customers the option of burning just an onion-scented or ketchup-scented candle. 

The candles joined several other quirky merchandise options on the website, including a sesame seed umbrella, gold-colored locket with the golden arches stamped on it, hair ties, socks, T-shirts, a beanie, and a lounge set. 

Swag: The candles were part of a Quarter Pounder Fan Club collection of merchandise, which also includes a locket
