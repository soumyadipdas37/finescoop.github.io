Remarkable new footage showed the Hindenburg Disaster in vivid color 83 years after it exploded mid-air and caused dozens of deaths near New Jersey.

More than 80 years after the Hindenburg Disaster became one of the most infamous aircraft failures to date, a group upscaled the original news coverage that captured the crash and added color.

Neural Networks and Deep Learning first shared the altered footage on their YouTube channel, as well as their Instagram page and Patreon, in February.

In the video, the 804-foot-long zeppelin has just traveled nearly 4,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean from Frankfurt, Germany, to the United States on May 3, 1937.

The massive airship, which completed 63 successful trips, floated over New York City with relative ease as it prepared to touch down its mooring mass at Naval Station Lakehurst in New Jersey.





But suddenly, the Hindenburg erupted into into a horrifying inferno that quickly engulfed the airship in scalding flames and billowing dark smoke. 

The hulking airship fell 200 feet from the sky onto the grassy fields below.

The colorized footage captured the sheer ferocity of the crash as the fire crawled along the Hindenburg's exterior and burned it to its bare bones. The Hindenburg eventually collapsed from the extensive damage

Radio journalist Herb Morrison had arrived to report on the Hindenburg's landing, but when the Hindenburg went up in flames he exclaimed, 'Oh, the humanity!' 









Firefighters and emergency crews can be seen approaching the 'twisted, white hot,' steel as they attempt to save the 36 passengers and 61 crew members.

History.com reports that 13 passengers, 21 crew members and one civilian died that day as a result of the crash. 

Many of the survivors suffered severe injuries from the crash and had to undergo additional medical treatment for months afterwards.

Just last year, the last remaining survivor of the Hindenburg Disaster died at the age of 90.

Werner Gustav Doehner passed away in Laconia, New Hampshire in November, more than eight decades after the German airship caught fire and was destroyed while docking in Lakehurst. 

Doehner, who was just eight years old at the time of the crash, was on the airship with his parents and older brother and sister. 

'He did not talk about it,' his son Bernie Doehner told The Associated Press on Friday, adding that his father took him to visit the naval station years later, but not the Hindenburg memorial, itself. 

At the time of its completion in 1936, the LZ 129 Hindenburg was the largest aircraft ever built, and was the pride of Germany's Third Reich. 

'It was definitely a repressed memory. He lost his sister, he lost his dad.'

Back in 2017, Doehner gave a rare interview with the Associated Press, recalling the moment flames began to flicker on top of the air ship as hydrogen, exposed to air, fueled an inferno.







'Suddenly, the air was on fire,' Doehner recalled.

'We were close to a window, and my mother took my brother and threw him out. She grabbed me and fell back and then threw me out,' he said. 

'She tried to get my sister, but she was too heavy, and my mother decided to get out by the time the zeppelin was nearly on the ground.'

Doehner added: 'I remember lying on the ground, and my brother told me to get up and to get out of there,' he recalled. Their mother joined them and asked a steward to get her daughter, whom he carried out of the burning wreckage.

He would remain in the hospital for three months before going to another facility in New York City in August for skin grafts.



The U.S. Commerce Department determined the accident was caused by a leak of the hydrogen that kept the airship aloft. It mixed with air, causing a fire. 

 'The theory that a brush discharge ignited such mixture appears most probable,' the department's report said. 

Doehner and his family - who were German citizens - were on their way back to Mexico City, where his father was a pharmaceutical executive. Funerals were held for his father and sister there.

Doehner was born in Darmstadt, Germany, and grew up in Mexico City. In 1984, he moved to the United States to work for General Electric as an electrical engineer, according to his obituary. He also worked in Ecuador and Mexico. He retired from New England Electric System in Westborough, Massachusetts, in 1999.

He moved to Parachute, Colorado, in 2001. He and his wife of 52 years, Elin, moved to Laconia in May 2018.
