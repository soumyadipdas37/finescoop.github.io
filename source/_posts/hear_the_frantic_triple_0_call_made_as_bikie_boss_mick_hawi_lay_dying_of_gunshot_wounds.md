A frantic Triple 0 call made as a bikie boss lay dying of gunshot wounds has been released, detailing his final moments as witnesses tried to desperately save him. 

Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi was shot multiple times while sitting in his black Mercedes in broad daylight outside a Fitness First gym in Rockdale on February 15, 2018.  

The harrowing audio clip of gym receptionist Stephanie Nicolaou describing the scene was released by the NSW Supreme Court on Friday, the Daily Telegraph reported.  

A harrowing Triple Zero call made after ex-Comancheros bikie boss Mick Hawi (pictured) was shot outside of a Fitness First gym in south Sydney in February 2018 has been released 

Ms Nicolaou was working at the front desk when she saw a man dressed in a black hoodie walk towards the ex-Comancheros chief's car before bullets were fired.  

'I need police and ambulance right away at Rockdale Fitness First. I just heard somebody come and shoot a person in the car,' Ms Nicolaou told the operator.

'There's glass everywhere... Somebody is giving CPR in the car right now,' she said.  

Ms Nicolaou began to cry and the emergency call operator tried to comfort her.

'Don't hang up on me okay? We've got police on the way and I'm getting an ambulance,' the operator said.

The receptionist continued to frantically describe what had happened.    

'I was at the reception, there was glass all around and I just ducked.   

Hawi was shot multiple times while sitting in his black Mercedes (pictured). The distressing call was made by receptionist Stephanie Nicolaou and detailed efforts to save him 

'The person was shot in the car, the car is stationary right now, somebody is trying to perform CPR,' she told the operator. 

Ms Nicolaou also described what the gunman was wearing and said they had fled the scene on foot.

'They were on foot, they were wearing a black hoodie... they just went out of the carpark, so where the cars drive in and out of.

'It looked like a male... I have no idea,' she explained. 

The operator asked Ms Nicolaou to take 'a big deep breath' and directed her to approach the car and see if Hawi was responding to the CPR.

Ms Nicolaou told the emergency line operator Hawi was unconscious and another witness was performing CPR (NSW Police at the scene of the shooting in Rockdale pictured) 

The receptionist could also be heard describing the shooter (CCTV of the shooting pictured) as wearing a black hoodie and fleeing the scene on foot 

'Can you ask if the person is making any progress? … The victim is unconscious?,' the operator asked. 

Ms Nicolaou confirmed that he was unconscious and the call ended with the operator assuring her emergency services were on the way.     

Hawi was rushed to hospital, where he later died. 

A NSW Supreme Court jury on Thursday found two men not guilty of Hawi's murder after five days of deliberation following a three-and-a-half week trial. 

Yusuf Guney Nazlioglu, 39, was accused of being the shooter while Jamal Eljaidi, 32, was said to be the getaway driver.    

The jury saw CCTV of the masked gunman, dressed in black from head to toe, leave the murder scene in a car driven by another man. 

Photos taken by police and tendered to the court during the trial showed Hawi's luxury 4WD riddled with bullet holes and shell casings.
