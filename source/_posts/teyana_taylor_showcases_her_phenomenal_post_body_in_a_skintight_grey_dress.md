Teyana looked incredible in the skin-tight grey dress which showed off her incredibly peachy posterior and her tiny waist, shortly after the arrival.

Teyana previously revealed that she had a water birth at her bathroom at home in Atlanta, just hours after celebrating her baby shower with friend.

She and husband Iman Shumpert took to Instagram to welcome daughter Rue Rose, who already has her own Instagram with more than 21,000 followers.
