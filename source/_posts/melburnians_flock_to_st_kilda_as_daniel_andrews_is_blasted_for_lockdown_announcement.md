A sunny Sunday in Melbourne saw hundreds of revellers flock to the sand at St Kilda Beach, just hours after Daniel Andrews announced lockdown restrictions would be extended. 

Pictures showed locals walking their dogs, rollerskating and splashing in the shallows in the balmy conditions while wearing face masks amid strict stage four coronavirus restrictions on Father's Day. 

The images come after Premier Andrews on Sunday announced Melbourne will remain under coronavirus lockdown until at least October 26, with some restrictions to be eased from midnight next Sunday.

Mr Andrews' lockdown extension has been criticised by fed-up residents, business owners and politicians alike, who blasted the Premier for his disappointing road map out of strict COVID-19 sanctions.

Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Paul Guerra said Mr Andrews' plan was a 'kick in the guts' for businesses across the state. 

'Today we have been delivered a road to nowhere,' he said.

'This does not deliver for the thousands of businesses that are trying to keep this state going and trying to keep their doors open.

'We can't continue to let business and jobs be decimated on the way to controlling the spread of the virus. This has to end. Business needs hope.'

Mr Guerra said the COVID recovery plan wasn't good enough and would leave thousands of employees out of work. 

'The heartbreak for members, and in fact business owners today is the realisation that many of them who have been desperately hanging on for months will see their businesses fold and they will have to look their employees in the eye and tell them that they no longer have a job,' he said.

'We need to get the virus under control. We are lock-step with both the federal and state governments on that aim. But we can't just let business and jobs be sacrificed on the way.'

Prime Minister Scott Morrison, federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg and minister for health Greg Hunt released a joint statement after Mr Andrews' announcement.

Mr Andrews ruled masks will remain compulsory and said he has a 'pretty conservative view' on the effectiveness of masks.

'There is a likelihood that at a point in the future we don't need to have compulsory masks or we alter the settings in which you need to use them,' he said. 

'Yes, it's a pain, no-one enjoys it. But compared to being locked at home, compared to people becoming gravely ill or becoming ill and not being able to shake this, and that is presenting in lots of people these days, think masks are we should continue to do.

'We will follow advice, of course, but I have been pretty conservative view on masks.' 

'Today's announcement from the Victorian government to extend lockdown arrangements will be hard and crushing news for the people of Victoria,' the trio said. 

'The proposed road map will come at a further economic cost. While this needs to be weighed up against mitigating the risk of further community outbreak, it is also true that the continued restrictions will have further impact on the Victorian and national economy, in further job losses and loss of livelihoods, as well as impacting on mental health.

'Of course the federal government would like to see restrictions in Victoria lifted as soon as it is safe to do so, but at the end of the day these are decisions solely for the Victorian Government to determine and the road map released today is a Victorian government plan.'

Victorian opposition leader Michael O'Brien called Mr Andrews' plan 'illogical'.

'Why is it that you can go to the local park and have a jog around with your mate, but if that mate is a personal trainer, sorry, you are both breaking the law,' he said.

'There is no logic to it. There are so many ridiculous, illogical inclusions.'

Social media lit up with furious Melburnians forced to spend another seven weeks trapped in lockdown after Mr Andrews' announcement.

'Another two weeks of tyranny,' one post reads.

'Daniel Andrews road map out is a cul-de-sac,' another tweet reads.

'This megalomaniac is out of control, the abuse of power has killed more people by suicide than the virus itself ever will,' another comment reads.

'I'm disgusted in both Daniel Andrews and Professor Brett Sutton who do not follow their own advise regarding the science.'

Mr Andrews on Sunday outlined a four-step plan for the state to return to normality if case numbers continue to fall. 

From September 14, the nightly curfew will start an hour later at 9pm and run until 5am. 

People living alone can nominate a friend or family member who can visit them and two hours of daily exercise will be allowed, including 'social interactions' such as having a picnic at a local park or reading a book at the beach. 

Further restrictions could be eased from September 28 and the government will consider lifting the curfew entirely from October 26, depending on case numbers.

'We can't run out of lockdown. We have to take steady and safe steps out of lockdown to find that COVID normal,' Mr Andrews said on Sunday. 

Under Mr Andrews' road map out of lockdown, residents will have to wait until November 23 for all retail stores to reopen.

Mr Andrews stressed the importance of easing slowly into normal life to avoid a dreaded third wave. 

'If we open up too fast then we have a very high likelihood that we are not really opening up at all,' he said.

'We would all like to open up as quickly as possible. We would all like to find that COVID normal or go back to actual normal as soon as possible.

'But that is not the nature of this virus. It is wicked in many ways.'

Victoria recorded 63 new cases of coronavirus and five more deaths on Sunday.

This takes the state's total fatalities to 666 and the national death toll to 753.
