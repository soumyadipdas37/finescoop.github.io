The identity of a frail, elderly woman found by the side of the road on Queensland's Sunshine Coast remains a mystery - and an advocacy group is outraged that she still remains in hospital with no home to go to.

The woman, believed to be in her 80s or 90s, was picked up by a driver on Brandenburg Road in Mooloolah Valley on September 8 and dropped outside Nambour Hospital.

Geoff Rowe, CEO of Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia, told Daily Mail Australia the situation is 'very difficult to comprehend'.

He said it seemed as though the woman had become lost in the system as no-one had come forward to say they recognise her.

'No one in that community has any recognition of her – and it is a small area,' Mr Rowe said.

'The mystery seems deep. If a child had been left and no one claimed, the community would be outraged. 

'It is ageism rife and well. We don't seem to care no one has claimed her.'

He said while he believes staff at the hospital have treated the woman well, there had been no progress into finding her a home or a guardian.

A guardian would allow police to take DNA from the woman, as well as make decisions about where the woman should be. 

He said Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia would make their services - which includes a legal clinic - available to the woman.

Last week police made another plea to the public to come forward if they recognised the woman.

Police Inspector Matt Robertson says the woman was in a vulnerable situation and 'very frail', requiring medical treatment.

The man who found the woman took her to hospital and told staff he didn't know her and had no reason to think he was doing anything except helping her.  

'He came in, he stated exactly what occurred and at this stage the evidence suggests what he said occurred,' Inspector Robertson said, according to the ABC.

'He does believe he might have seen her in the area before.'  

While police were eager to find out more about the case, they were not investigating any criminality or elderly abuse, and just want to find her family.

Police have released an image of her ring in the hopes it might help someone identity her. 

'Our primary investigation is just to locate who this lady is to reunite her with her family,' Inspector Robertson.

Police have been unable to ask the woman who she is because she has been suffering a 'challenging health situation', although she is improving after being transferred to Sunshine Coast University Hospital.

Inspector Robertson said she was now able to communicate verbally and have conversations with people.

'It's not something where we've been able to go charging in very quickly with and we're taking it one step at a time and exploring those avenues as she's capable,' he said.

Police are unable to DNA test people without their permission, so they're hoping someone can identify the woman.

'That's going to be our quickest line of inquiry without bureaucracy, sending off inquiries that could take days to get back,' Inspector Robertson said.

'It only takes one person, who knows a person, to make one phone call and we can identify the lady.'

He said the woman's situation was unique, agreeing that it was almost like a reverse missing person's case.

'We have the located person, we're just trying to find the family,' he said.
