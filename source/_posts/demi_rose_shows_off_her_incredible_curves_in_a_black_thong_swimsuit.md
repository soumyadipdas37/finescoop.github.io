She might be living the dream in Ibiza, showcasing her incredible body in a series of incredible swimwear sets. 

And Demi Rose was at it once again on Monday sharing pictures of her incredible curves while on holiday in Ibiza. 

The model, 24, showed off her ample assets in a black one-piece which had a thong design as she enjoyed a boat ride. 

Stunning: Demi Rose showed off her incredible curves in a black thong swimsuit on holiday in Ibiza on Instagram on Monday as she lamented being stung by a jellyfish

She wore a pair of cats eye sunglasses as she pouted up a storm for the camera, while enjoying the sunshine. 

Demi captioned the images with the words: 'todo perfecto' which means 'everything is perfect' in Spanish. 

While things might seem perfect, her Twitter account was telling a different tale and Demi lamented that she has been marked after being stung by a jellyfish.

She penned that she was disappointed that she couldn't enjoy a peaceful swim without jellyfish surrounding her. 

'It was my first time getting stung a week ago and I'm just like ffs these marks need to go.'  

'Basically I don’t like Jellyfish' she wrote. 

Demi added: 'It’s Jelly season over here in ibiza and it’s just impossible to swim without getting stung'.

Despite the prospect of two weeks behind closed doors upon her return to the UK - the result of tightening travel restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 - Demi still seems to be smiling. 







Not happy: Demi had some things to say about the jellyfish that stung her 

Spain had been among of a number of 'air-bridge' countries considered to be safe for quarantine-free travel, promoting many stars to book getaways, but a spike in coronavirus cases across the country has prompted a change in policy.

Before her trip to Ibiza, the Birmingham native had been isolating in her London flat after the novel coronavirus pandemic scuppered her travel plans for March - much to her displeasure.

Taking to social media at the time, the brunette lamented: 'All I have with me is crochet stuff and bikinis. I'm sick of wearing all the other stuff that I bought that is loungey.

Woah mama! Demi was one again keen to put her best assets on display as she posed up a storm for a sizzling snap on Sunday
