Arsenal have finally confirmed the £27m signing of defender Gabriel Magalhaes - as the club unveiled him a video on social media. 

The club had teased fans by announcing that David Luiz and Willian will be joined by a 'special guest' in a group chat video, showing a picture of both players alongside a silhouette with a question mark, saying: 'You don't want to miss this one!'

They hinted that both players would reveal their fellow Brazilian as a Gunners player with the quote: 'I'm not sure I can talk about it yet... Let's call him!'

Arsenal emerged as front runners to land Magalhaes after agreeing a deal to sign him earlier this month - beating off competition from the likes of Napoli, Manchester United and Chelsea.

Last week he was in London to complete his medical, but was forced to quarantine for 14 days after arriving in the UK - meaning he faces a wait before linking up with Mikel Arteta's squad.

Gunners fans have been so keen for the club to wrap up the deal some even claimed to be tracking the Brazilian's car, with Twitter user @smeagol_11 claiming to have found a vehicle owned by the youngster on the M1.  

Magalhaes emerged as one of the most sought-after defenders in Europe after a standout season with Lille, where he played 34 times for the club and starred in the Champions League.

He played a total of 52 games for Lille after beginning his career with Brazilian side Avai - who he joined at the age of 13. He left for the Ligue 1 side in 2017 - quickly adjusting to life in France by learning the language. 

He becomes Arsenal's fourth major signing of the summer after bringing in Pablo Mari and Cedric Soares on permanent deals from Flamengo and Southampton respectively, while Willian has also joined on a free transfer from Chelsea.

The arrival comes as a huge boost to Arteta, who has been hoping to strengthen his defensive options for the upcoming season, with his defenders coming under fire for a string of errors leading to goals.

William Saliba has also returned from a loan spell at St Etienne to give the Spaniard a few options to choose from.

And the resurgence of David Luiz in the middle of the back four means Magalhaes will have to fight for his place.
