Tyler Crispen nearly sacrificed himself for castmates Da'Vonne Rogers and Bayleigh Dayton on Wednesday's episode of Big Brother All-Stars.

In a remorseful moment, the 23-year-old contestant apologized for the scheming he'd done this season, sure that it led them to be put up for eviction.

He knew how tight their bond was, and how important it was for them to make an impact on the game, believing in the strength of 'Black girl magic.'

With that in mind, he offered to replace one of them on the chopping block. 

It was a suggestion that Da'Vonne, 32, and Bayleigh, 27, could hardly believe.

'I wanna win, but I want to do it the right way,' Tyler told them. 'When you guys were put up, something clicked within me. I see how bad you want to win, and I feel guilty. I don't want to take that away from you guys.'

He worried that he had created divisions among the house's female members, pitting them against one another.

Chopping block: Bayleigh and Da'Vonne remained nominated for eviction after Christmas decided to keep her picks the same

'I think you deserve better, and you're standing for something greater than me,' Tyler told his pals, preparing to speak to Head of Household Christmas Abbott, 35. 'I want to see that play out.'

Da'Vonne was visibly moved, telling him, 'No one ever throws us a life vest, and you're throwing us a life vest. And that means a lot.'

Christmas was less interested in Tyler's proposition, however, especially as he was her 'untouchable,' the person with whom she hoped to end the game.

Something greater: 'I think you deserve better, and you're standing for something greater than me,' Tyler told his pals

She kept the two women up for eviction, even after she won the golden power of the veto.

'Tyler is a snake, and Christmas is a sheep,' Bayleigh raged. 'They deserve each other.'

Being nominated for elimination by Christmas, whom she trusted, had really hurt Bayleigh.

Not happy: 'Tyler is a snake, and Christmas is a sheep,' Bayleigh raged after she and Da'Vonne remained on the chopping block. 'They deserve each other'

She was ready to leave the show, and Da'Vonne tried to talk her out of it.

'One of us have to win it, make her put up somebody bigger,' she told Bayleigh. 'I cannot afford for you to feel defeated.'

The two women cried together, as David Alexander, 30, awkwardly hugged them.

Privately, David acknowledged that he had recently won 'the Disruptor Power,' which would allow him to remove one nominee from the block, but he didn't plan to use it.

'I need to save this power for when I go on the block, so I can save myself,' he revealed.

Bayleigh then confronted Christmas, who cried over her decision to nominate her friend.

She told Bayleigh that she'd chosen her because she'd said that Da'Vonne was her 'untouchable,' and would never forsake her in the game.

'That just lets me know that no matter how much we work together, that she is higher than me on the totem pole,' Christmas said in a confessional.

As Bayleigh listened, Da'Vonne set about trying to create that 'bigger target in the house.'

She told Danielle Donato, 33, that Tyler had been selling her out among her castmates, and said that Dani was coming for them.

'I swear to you, Da'Vonne, I have never ever, ever said anything about getting you out,' Dani vowed.

She grew incensed at the thought that Tyler, her alliance partner in The Committee, had betrayed her.

'He has to be backdoored,' the stay-at-home mom told Da'Vonne.

To Christmas, who was also part of The Committee, Dani said that she thought Tyler was trying to pit the women of the house against each other.

'We're in an alliance,' Christmas marveled, upset. 'We have each other's back.'

Not long afterward, she would meet up with Bayleigh and Da'Vonne in the week's veto competition, where they were joined by Dani, Nicole Franzel, 28, and Ian Terry, 29.

Ian bowed out because he felt terrible, with a pounding heart and chest pains after two sleepless nights.

The veto game, called BB Mathcathalon, required players to look at screens bearing math equations, and then to race only when they saw one totaling 13.

Players were eliminated for false starts and for being the last to reach the finish line.

Depending on how they placed, they would earn a prize, which they could keep or trade.

After trading, Christmas got the power of veto, Dani got a home gym and a Have-Not pass, Bayleigh received 500 laps' punishment, Da'Vonne earned $5,000, and Nicole got a 'slopitard.'

The winner: Christmas won the competition and gained the power of veto

Back in the house, Tyler was telling people he wanted to leave the game.

'I feel like I'm the cause for a lot of stress in the house right now, and that's not how I want to play,' he said. 'I feel like I'm the one that got the house pitted against Da'Vonne and Bayleigh, and this is the source of all my tension.'

Tyler apologized to Bayleigh and Da'Vonne for having pointed a finger at Dani.

Feeling down: Back in the house, Tyler was telling people he wanted to leave the game

'I wanted to help you guys out, but I also wanted to set myself up where you guys would be coming for each other and not coming for me,' he explained. 'I'm a competitor and I love this game so much. I want to stand for something bigger.'

The jewelry company owner confessed that he was planning to ask Christmas to use her veto on either Bayleigh or Da'Vonne, and then put him up for elimination in their stead.

'I don't to be idolized for being manipulative and a good liar,' he said. 'If people are going to look up to me, I want it to be for something like this. That's the only way I would wanna go out is you guys flourish and hopefully build off of this.'

Candid conversation: 'I don't to be idolized for being manipulative and a good liar,' Tyler told Bayleigh and Da'Vonne. 'If people are going to look up to me, I want it to be for something like this. That's the only way I would wanna go out is you guys flourish and hopefully build off of this'

Tyler then went to Christmas, who denied his request and said his machinations had not affected her initial decision.

Privately, she was furious with him for giving up.

'What the heck, Tyler?' Christmas said to the cameras. 'You're my final two, my ride-or-die, and now you want me to back-door you? Duuuuude.'

Final two: 'What the heck, Tyler?' Christmas said to the cameras. 'You're my final two, my ride-or-die, and now you want me to back-door you? Duuuuude'

Bayleigh was excited by Tyler's suggestion, but wondered aloud if the whole thing was just a ploy for Tyler to look good on TV, without actually getting kicked out.

'I don't trust him, and I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him,' she reflected. 'A leopard does not change their spots.'

Da'Vonne tried to win Christmas over by telling her that Bayleigh's only beef was with Tyler—not her—though she did want 'his head on a platter.'

No trust: 'I don't trust him, and I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him,'  Bayleigh reflected of Tyler. 'A leopard does not change their spots'

'Learning that Bayleigh still has it out for Tyler majorly, and he's literally throwing his game away to save her really makes me want to keep noms the same,' Christmas conceded.

When she told Tyler what she'd heard, he decided to stop being a martyr, and save himself.

The veto ceremony came, and Christmas decided not to use her veto to save the women.

Da'Vonne was disappointed at being let down by Tyler all over again.

'I was under the impression that we were going to get a second chance,' she told the cameras. 'No. I basically was just told, ''Wake up, boo. You're playing Big Brother''.'

Big Brother All-Stars will return Thursday on CBS.
