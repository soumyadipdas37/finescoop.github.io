She's quite a prolific artist, and a poetic one, at that.

And Lana Del Rey was celebrating the release of her new book of poetry, titled Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass, on Thursday, with a series of whimsical images on her Instagram.

The Mariner's Apartment Complex songbird, 35, kept up the retro vibes in the collection of images, video and boomerangs, spread over her Instagram feed and Stories.

The main photos of the queen of nostalgia showed her in a picnic setting, wearing a wide brimmed straw hat and white floral sweetheart top in dappled sunlight. 

The statement element of Lana's ensemble, however, were her beguiling white opera gloves, which were covered in bubble-like pearls.

She matched these with very high-heeled chunky pumps, also weighted with a multitude of improbable pearls.

The heels were mainly visible in snippets in which Del Rey leafed through the pages of her tome, the cover of which displays artwork showing an orange tree of sorts.

'Very excited that Violet bent backwards over the grass is out everywhere on Monday,' the White Mustang songstress wrote in the caption of a Boomerang clip of her glancing from her book, to the camera, to the sunlight above. 'Thank you so much for supporting'.

She went on in the caption to say that the 'proceeds of the entirety of the advance from Simon and Schuster [are] being split up between three organizations including the Navajo Water Project which will reopen in January.'

Another image of the gorgeous Grammy nominee showed her topless wrapped in a towel, open-mouthed, over the caption 'Bodega Bae Waiting for the birds to attack'.

It was a reference to the 1963 Alfred Hitchcock classic The Birds, which was set in Northern California's Bodega Bay.

The reference fit perfectly in Lana's old-school universe, as she frequently calls up instances of Americana from the 50s and 60s.

Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass was also released as an audiobook/spoken word album this summer, in late July.

The work featured Lana reading her verses of poetry, along with music from frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff. 

And for fans of Del Rey's music, they reportedly won't have to wait much longer – the singer is on the precipice of releasing her seventh studio album this year, titled Chemtrails Over The Country Club.

It will be the followup word to her acclaimed 2019 record, Norman F**king Rockwell!.
