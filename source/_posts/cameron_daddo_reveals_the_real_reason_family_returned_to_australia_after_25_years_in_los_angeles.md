Cameron Daddo and Alison Brahe returned to Australia in 2017 after chasing the Hollywood dream in Los Angeles for 25 years.

And now the former Australian 'golden couple' have shared the real reason they left Tinseltown three years ago.

Australian actor Daddo, 55, told TV Week on Monday that while he and model wife Brahe, 50, struggled to make ends meet at times, the decision to relocate their family was much more personal.

Cameron and Alison, who marred in 1991, share three children: daughters Lotus, 24, and Bodhi Faith, 14, and son River, 20. 

The couple had moved to Los Angeles in 1992, where Cameron landed small roles in shows such as Models Inc., The Mentalist and NCIS.

However, while a stable Hollywood career was always Cameron's end goal, he realised his desire to be around family was more strong.

'Over the years, we'd had our moments [of wanting to come home],' Cameron said, adding that they missed out on the joy of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, but experienced the devastation surrounding the 9/11 terrorist attack on The World Trade Centre in 2001.

'What we didn't have were our parents and my siblings and their families. We wanted our kids to know them – and particularly our parents in their later years. So it just felt like the right time to come home,' Cameron said of the family's reason for relocating.

Cameron is the eldest of five siblings, with brothers Andrew and Lochie Daddo both prominent Australian actors and presenters.

Earlier this year, Cameron reflected on moving back to Australia three years ago with his wife, Alison Brahe, and their three children.

Sharing a black and white photo of his family to Instagram, the actor said that he finds 'the deepest feelings of love' when he steps outside of his comfort zone.

New lease: Cameron said that embracing change has made him a kinder person and filled him with gratitude

'Three years ago on this day, we'd recovered from saying goodbye to our family and friends in the USA,' Cameron wrote in the caption.

'We'd had an eventful stop-gap in Fiji that included hospital drips, tsunami warnings and food poisoning. We'd picked up Dobby [their dog] from quarantine, loaded the car and trailer and set off on our new life in Oz.' 

He added that embracing change has made him a kinder person and filled him with gratitude.
