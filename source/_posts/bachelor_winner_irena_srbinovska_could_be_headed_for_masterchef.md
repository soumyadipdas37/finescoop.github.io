Irena Srbinovska is the frontrunner to win Locky Gilbert's heart on the latest season of The Bachelor. 

And it seems the Melbourne nurse isn't yet done with reality TV, telling The Wash this week that she has her sights set on MasterChef. 

The keen baker, who has shared her creations to Instagram in the past, told the website she would be 'flattered' if asked to take part in the cooking show.

'I would be flattered if MasterChef asked me to be a part of their show,' she said on Friday.

The 31-year-old is a talented chef who in 2013 won first place at the Tastes of Central Geelong food festival with her 10-layer coffee cake. 

In 2014, she won again with her delicious macaroons - of which she made a whopping 500.

Keen! Irena told The Huffington Post that she loves baking. 'I've always wanted to work in the food industry, like having my own vegan cafe is my dream,' she said. Pictured: Her creations 

She told The Huffington Post that she loves baking and almost opened her own local cafe.

'I've always wanted to work in the food industry, like having my own vegan cafe is my dream,' she told the paper.   

It comes after photos surfaced that seemingly prove Irena is the winner of The Bachelor.

The nurse has long been the favourite to win, and new paparazzi pictures strongly suggest she gets the final rose.

While there is no 'money shot' of Locky and Irena together, photographers staking out her home in Melbourne have noticed that her car hasn't moved in a week.  

Her 'disappearance' has led some insiders to suspect she was secretly whisked off to Sydney a week ago ahead of the season finale, which airs next Thursday.

If Locky and Irena are indeed a couple - and Channel 10 insists he's still dating his winner - then they will be contractually obliged to do press together the next day.

In order for Irena to be available for media interviews in Sydney by next Friday, she would have to have left Melbourne last week.
