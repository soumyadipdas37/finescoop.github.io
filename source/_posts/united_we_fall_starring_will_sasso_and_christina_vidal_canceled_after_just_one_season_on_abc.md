United We Fall will not be getting back up for a second season, with the show canceled by ABC.

The half-hour sitcom was essentially a 'leftover' from the 2019-2020 season, with the eight-episode run airing in July and August, though Deadline reports the show will not be returning for a second season.

While the sitcom did put up decent numbers during its eight-episode run, it wasn't enough to warrant a second season.

United We Fall is described as a, 'profoundly realistic family sitcom,' which follows the lives of Jo (Christina Vidal) and Bill (Will Sasso), parents of two young kids, as they try to make it day to day as a functioning family. 

Bill and Jo live with their two kids Emily (Ella Grace Helton) and Lulu (Ireland and Sedona Carvajal), though their lives are upended when Bill's neurotic mother Sandy moves in with them after recovering from an illness.

On top of that, Joe's Latinx Catholic family is always stopping by, including her brother Chuy (Guillermo Diaz), and through it all, Bill and Jo always have each other's backs, 'united against everyone - other parents, teachers, doctors, specialists, coaches, co-workers and especially their kids,' according to the series description.

The show's cancellation may be indicative of a trend where network sitcoms, once one of the most viable models on television, is going by the wayside.

Sony Pictures Television, which produced United We Fall, has reportedly told networks they will not be selling network comedy shows under the current financial model, according to an August report from Deadline.

Lionsgate Television has been engaged in similar internal discussions, and they have also been discussing ways to create a new business model for broadcast comedy.
