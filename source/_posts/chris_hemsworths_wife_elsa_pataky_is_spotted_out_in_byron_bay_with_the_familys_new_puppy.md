Elsa Pataky enjoyed a family day out in Byron Bay on the far north New South Wales coast on Wednesday.

The 44-year-old Spanish-born actress was joined by her mother, Cristina, one of her six-year-old twin sons, and the family's new puppy.

Elsa was dressed casually for the outing, stepping out in a pair of stonewash grey tracksuit pants with a drawstring waist.

She paired them with a baggy hot pink knit jumper, which hung loosely off one of her shoulders.

The Tidelands actress also wore a pair of grey high-top sneakers, and her blonde hair was tied back in a messy updo.

Elsa appeared to have been makeup-free on the outing, and she wore a pair of yellow-tinted sunglasses.

Standing on the sidelines of what appeared to have been a sporting game, Elsa kept a watchful eye as she sipped from a purple and aqua-coloured drink bottle. 

Her mother was spotted crouching down next to Elsa's young son, who sat beside the family's adorable new puppy.

The fluffy white dog sat patiently, watching the action, with Cristina holding onto its leash.
