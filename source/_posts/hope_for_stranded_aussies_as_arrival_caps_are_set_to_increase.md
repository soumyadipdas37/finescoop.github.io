Arrival caps limiting the number of Australians who can enter the country are set to increase if states agree to a federal plan.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack on Wednesday announced he wants to lift the weekly cap from 4,000 to 6,000. 

'We will increase the number of Australians coming into Sydney by 500 a week,' he said.

'As well 500 more will be coming into Queensland and I urge and encourage Annastacia Palaszczuk to look at the Gold Coast and Cairns.

'Likewise WA is increasing its capacity by 500. SA about 360. I have just finished a phone call with Premier Steven Marshall and he wants to do as much as he can.' 

One mother, from Perth, posted images to Facebook on Saturday of her children (pictured), including and infant, sleeping on the airport floor using winter coats for warmth
