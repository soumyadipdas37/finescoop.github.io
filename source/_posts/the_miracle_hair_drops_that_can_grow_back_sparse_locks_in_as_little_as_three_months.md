Miracle 'hair drops' developed by a leading expert in scalp care have been given hundreds of five-star reviews by customers - with one sharing her incredible transformation after just three months.   

Heritage UK hair care label Philip Kingsley, whose founder of the same name coined the term 'bad hair day', sell the Tricho Pro and Tricho 7 worldwide to restore hair follicles to full strength - something fashion blogger Lorna Luxe is grateful for.

The stylish 'influencer' with 1.1million followers recently showcased how Philip's trichology range of products - including a shampoo, conditioner and the drops - has grown back her fine hair.

She consulted with Anabel Kingsley - Philip's daughter - before trialling the specially formulated ointments, which can be purchased in Australia from Adore Beauty and Cosmetics Now.

The Tricho Pro, which is AUD$77.50, works as a pre-styling heat protectant that reduces the amount of hair breakage while volumising the locks. 

Its key ingredient - organic quinoa protein - adds strength to help reduce breakage.

'After moving to remote town that has terrible water quality, my hair has been snapping off, frizzy and so dehydrated from all of the minerals in the water. This has saved it,' one customer reported.

'I've recently discovered this brand and after trying the shampoo for my decades-long flakey scalp I have since tried a few other products including this one. I highly recommend this product,' said another.

Meanwhile the second step in the daily process, the AUD$117.95 Tricho 7, contains green tea extract to fight against damaging free radicals, Piroctone Olamine to remove dry flakes from the scalp and Methyl Nicotinate to enlarge the scalp's blood capillaries and improve circulation. 

'I was in complete despair when I looked up this product on the Phillip Kingsley website,' one shopper said.

Philip Kingsley is best known for its Elasticizer hair mask, which leaves hair feeling soft and shiny

'I was losing my hair and had two bald patches, so I purchased the Tricho set and persevered and followed the instructions doing the daily routine... within three months I was getting new growth. 

'I was over the moon that I had found something that actually worked. Yes, it was expensive but it did solve my hair problem and I no longer have those bald patches.'

The brand also stocks a range of supplements, called PK4 Soya Protein Boost, that claim to accelerate hair growth and improve its quality.

Soya Protein is a source of essential amino acids, which are the building blocks of Keratin - the protein that hair is made of.  

Unfortunately these are currently out of stock on the website due to their popularity.
