Kyle Sandilands took revenge on Ben Fordham this week after the fellow radio star mocked the shock jock's efforts at parking his $1.3 million Rolls-Royce Phantom. 

The KIISS FM star was in Surry Hills to dine at a local restaurant and was struggling to find parking. 

As Kyle, 49, attempted to u-turn in the middle of the road to fit into a too-small spot while irate drivers honked at him, he got a call from Ben, 43, who happened to be at the same restaurant and was watching the hilarity unfold from a balcony.

'He rings me up having a laughing at me. He says, 'Look up! Look up at me!' There's this celebrity and a bunch of other people laughing at me on the balcony!' Kyle relayed on the Kyle and Jackie O Show.  

'He said, 'What are you doing? It's embarrassing!' I said, 'Go F yourself! And hung up' Kyle added.   

He asked listeners to guess who the celebrity was, but when they could not, Kyle admitted it was Ben - saying they are close, and the radio star is one of only ten people who have Kyle's number.

Once Kyle got inside, having handed the keys to his manager Bruno to finish parking, Ben found him and continued to have mock him. 

Kyle decided to call Ben live on air to confront him - and to reveal how he got his revenge.    

'Honestly my grandmother can drive better than you and she's been dead 15 years,' Ben joked on the show.

He explained: 'I was just sitting there trying to enjoy a nice quiet lunch and I look down – it's the size of the thing that's the give away. The most show pony vehicle in Sydney. Here's me in my little Mazda.

'He starts doing the 20 point turn that turns into a 40 point turn, and he gets Bruno to get out like his man servant to wave him in.

'Maybe driving isn't for you mate, once you reach a certain age you need to give up the license!' Ben joked.   

Ben then revealed that he had sent over two bottles of wine to Kyle's table to apologise for mocking him - but Kyle left him with the entire bill instead.

'My bill was $600 and I had a small lunch!' Ben complained to which Kyle replied: 'I forgot, I said Ben’s picking up the tab!'

Co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson asked if Ben paid up, and he said: 'Of course I paid for it! I didn’t want to be arrested'. 

Jackie also told Kyle he should pay Ben back, to which Kyle said: 'No way. Screw the a**hole. I got up and left and didn’t even think about who was paying the bill

'He didn’t even call or text, gutless wonder. That's the pecking order in radio. Last in, must pay!'
