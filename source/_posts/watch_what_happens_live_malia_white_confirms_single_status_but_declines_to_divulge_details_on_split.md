Malia White confirmed her single status Monday during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live on Bravo.

The 30-year-old bosun on Below Deck Mediterranean was asked by host Andy Cohen, 52,  about her relationship status after alluding to a recent split with co-star Tom Checketts. 

Andy noted that Malia last week posted a meme on Instagram about guys cheating and hinted about being single.

 'Are you single and did Tom cheat on you?,' Andy asked.

 'I am single. Yes, I am very much single. Yes,' Malia confirmed.

 'What happened?,' Andy followed up.

'This industry is tough. We work apart for a long time and there are some bad apples out there,' Malia replied.

Andy pointed out that Malia and Tom were 'all over each other' during the show reunion that was recently filmed.  

'My understanding was that you kind of were open while you were away and then you came back together, or maybe I was wrong,' Andy said.  

'Well, I think I was wrong about that, too,' Malia said with a chuckle.

Andy asked if she found out via social media and Malia declined to share details.

'I don't really want to get into it, but Tom and I are done. I'm single and that's the downside to this industry. It's really tough to work apart and work on these boats. Because obviously you've seen it, attractions happen and things happen. So, yeah,' Malia said.

'It's yachting,' chimed in fellow guest Captain Sandy Yawn, 55.

Malia admitted to feeling regret for trying to help head chef Tom who was  clashing with Sandy during season five of the Bravo show. 

'I wish I wouldn't have saved him, I guess. But, in the moment I was blinded by love and our relationship and was trying to hold everything together. But, yeah, I wish I would've stayed out of it,' Malia said.

Andy also introduced the  Return Of The Shady Cucumber and the gourd with a heavy surfer accent reminiscent of Jeff Spicoli asked Malia a 'marry, shag, kill' question among lead deckhand Alex Radcliffe, deckhand Robert Westergaard and chef Tom.

'Marry Alex, shag Rob, kill Tom,' Malia said with a laugh.  

'Wow, how thing have changed,' Andy said before asking Malia if she was 'super sad' following the breakup.

' No, actually not. I'm good. I'm focused. ...I'm focused on my career,' Malia said.

Captain Sandy, who is openly gay, raised eyebrows last week when she suggested on Cameo that Malia was secretly gay and that was the reason behind her split with Tom.

Malia responded on Instagram confirming their split and expressing her shock that her sexual orientation was being discussed on Cameo.

'First off, if I was gay, I would just like to say it should be my decision when and if to out it to the entire internet,' she continued.

'But no, I'm not, but if I was, I would be openly proud to be gay. I'm a huge supporter of the community and, yeah, I'll just leave it at that,' Malia added.

Sandy later apologized for the comment and tried to blame editing, saying last week on Instagram, 'I was wrong for making that comment'.

'That clip was taken out of context, it was sliced to make it into something it was not. My apologies to Malia!,' Sandy insisted.

The matter was not mentioned during Malia and Sandy's joint virtual appearance on WWHL.
