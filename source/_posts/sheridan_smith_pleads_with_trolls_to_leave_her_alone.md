Sherdian Smith has pleaded with online trolls to 'leave her alone' after she said she wouldn't be posting pictures of her baby son on social media.

The actress, 39, who welcomed her little boy in May, said that her son was the only thing that 'kept her going' during a candid reply to her Instagram followers. 

Posting pictures of herself as a baby Sheridan told fans: 'I won't be putting pics of the boy up on social media. But basically ... he looks like a male version of me. Just less 80's and more handsome! God love him! we all send our love.'

Although many fans were supportive of Sheridan's choice, one person criticised her and wrote: 'But you'll happily abuse his right to privacy to make TV documentaries. And cash. The hypocrisy of Sheridan', referring to her recent documentary, Sheridan Smith: Becoming Mum.

Sheridan replied: 'He wasn't in it but I'm sorry you feel that way. I was just expressing my mental health issues and hoping to help others.x'

Sheridan later said of the trolls: 'I know I can't stop them but my boy is the only thing that keeps me going. Please leave us alone.'

Ex strictly dancer Kevin Clifton supported her saying: 'I really don't understand the mindset of people who make these comments.' 

Sheridan's new documentary Sheridan Smith: Becoming Mum aired on ITV last month.

Viewers were left in tears as they praised the actress for 'breaking the taboo' on maternal mental health as she allowed cameras to follow her during her journey to motherhood.

Sheridan, who welcomed son with fiancé Jamie Horn, candidly discussed fears that her mental health issues could resurface during her pregnancy, and wanted the documentary to help other women.

The actress had an emergency caesarean when her baby arrived early this summer, while the country was in lockdown. 

Cameras followed the star as she attended her first scans, pre-natal classes and sessions with a specialist therapist Dr Alain Gregoire, as well as at home with Jamie. 

She said: 'It's such a huge thing to have a baby. I would hate for the wheels to come off during pregnancy or post pregnancy.

'There are so many women out there who feel the same as me, who are just as scared as me, and we need to go and get some answers.'

Sheridan has been incredibly open about her struggles with mental health following the death of her father Colin in 2016.

Sheridan’s eldest brother Julian was diagnosed with cancer in childhood and tragically died aged just 18 in 1990.

In the documentary Sheridan recalled how she performed songs and danced to entertain him when he was unwell.

She said: 'No-one knows really what's going on behind it all. The biggest worry, you've had mental health issues in the past, will it rear its ugly head again?

Viewers were overwhelmed by the impact of Becoming Mum, and took to Twitter to reveal that they were in tears as they thanked the star for her bravery, and hailed her as an 'inspiration.' 

One person tweeted: 'Sheridan I absolutely adore you. Crying already,' while another wrote: 'I'm crying at the opening title sequence of #becomingmum I love Sheridan so much.'  

'Totally just had some tears then when @sheridansmith1 was talking about her brother #becomingmum,' confessed another.  

'@sheridansmith im already holding back the tears. always loved watching your shows, love how real and honest you are.
