Nicola Adams will allegedly become the first female contestant to wear trousers throughout her run on Strictly Come Dancing.

The boxer, 37, is said to not want to wear dresses as it would feel 'unnatural', as it was also claimed professional Katya Jones had won the battle to be her dance partner.

A source speaking to The Sun on Saturday said of Nicola's wardrobe choices on the show: 'Anyone who knows Nicola will be aware that her wardrobe consists of jeans and trousers so it would be really unnatural for her to wear a dress.

The source added that the costume department have already made plans to deck Nicola's suits with sparkle and sequins, and the professional athlete is said to be thankful show bosses are keen to ensure she feels 'relaxed'.

Meanwhile, Katya's 'strong interest' in working with Nicola as part of the show's first same-sex dance couple has meant she's 'winning' the battle to to do so, according to a report from The Daily Star.

It was previously reported that Katya was hoping to be paired with boxer Nicola after admitting she would 'love' to be apart of the first same-sex pairing.

The beauty is said to be a 'huge believer in girl power' and is 'telling everyone' how much she wants to be paired with the Olympic gold medallist.

A source told The Sun: 'She sees it as a chance to make history but also to redeem herself on the show after her scandal two years ago.

'She's a real girls' girl and is keen to move on from that.'

Nicola is set to be in the first same-sex pairing on the BBC show, as she said in a statement: 'It's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.'  

Speaking live from her home on BBC Breakfast, Nicola said of her groundbreaking all-female pairing: 'It's really important, it's a big step for the show as well. It's nice to see we've been able to move on and I just can't wait to get some dancing done really.' 

Revealing she approached Strictly with the idea for a same-sex pairing, Nicola explained: 'I asked the show about it. They wanted to know if I wanted to be on the show and I said "yeah I'll do it but I want to dance with another female dance partner.'"

'It's definitely a time for change and time to move on and be more diverse. This is a brilliant step in the right direction. It will be nice for the LGBT community to be able to see that there are same sex couples on the show as well.'
