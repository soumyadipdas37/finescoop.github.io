First Lady Melania Trump wowed in white while hosting a socially-distanced roundtable discussion to raise awareness for sickle cell disease (SCD) on Monday. 

The White House even was held in the State Dining Room just a few weeks after President Donald Trump formally recognized September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month. 

Melania cut a stylish figure in a $945 white belted midi dress by Max Mara, and she added a pop of color to her sleek look with her sky-high orange stilettos. 

First Lady duties: Melania Trump, 50, hosted a roundtable discussion to raise awareness for sickle cell disease (SCD) on Monday

Outfit of the day: Melania cut a stylish figure in a $945 white belted midi dress by Max Mara and added a pop of color to her sleek look with her sky-high orange stilettos

Style: Melania's highlighted brown hair was styled loosely around her shoulders, and she stuck with her signature makeup: dark, smokey eyeshadow and a pink lip

The former model's perfectly tailored sheath dress was made in Italy from stretch wool, fully lined, and cut with a single vent in the back. 

The sold-out design comes with a removable woven belt that matches the frock's braided trims, which she opted to wear.      

Melania has favored minimalistic looks over the years, and Monday's look was no exception. She let her shoes and dress doing to talking by keeping her jewelry to a minimum. 

The first lady wore nothing more than two sparkly platinum and diamond bands — one on each of her hands.  

Her highlighted brown hair was styled loosely around her shoulders, and she stuck with her signature makeup: dark, smokey eyeshadow and a pink lip.

Ready to go: The first lady had a bright smile on her face when she entered the State Dining Room of the White House ahead of the discussion 

Happy: Melania spoke with SCD patients, researchers, and medical professionals at the event

Attendees: Melania, who did not wear a mask, was seated between a young patient named Samuel Price and Ashley Valentine, the co-founder and president of Sick Cells

Risky? While there were sickle cell disease patients of varying ages, including children, only a few people who were seated at the table wore a mask

Melania had a bright smile on her face when she entered the State Dining Room ahead of the discussion with patients, researchers, and medical professionals. 

And while there were sickle cell disease patients of varying ages, including children, only a few people who were seated at the table wore a mask. 

Having sickle cell disease increases a person's risk for severe illness from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   

Melania, who did not wear a mask, was seated between a young patient named Samuel Price and Ashley Valentine, the co-founder and president of Sick Cells, which raises awareness for SCD. 

Valentine was one of the few attendees who was photographed wearing a mask, though she briefly removed it while speaking.  

Right on time: The event came just a few weeks after President Donald Trump formally recognized September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month

Chronic condition: Sickle cell disease is the umbrella term for a group of inherited conditions that severely affect red blood cells

All ears: Melania listened intently as sickle cell disease patient Samuel Price spoke 

Protected: Ashley Valentine was one of the few attendees who was photographed wearing a mask, though she briefly removed it while speaking

Sickle cell disease is the umbrella term for a group of inherited conditions that severely affect red blood cells.

Healthy red blood cells — produced by stem cells within bone marrow — are biconcave discs that can bend and flex easily. However, in those with sickle cell disease, faulty stem cells produce red blood cells that are crescent shaped.

They are rigid, unable to squeeze through smaller blood vessels and prone to causing blockages that deprive parts of the body of oxygen.

Sufferers are not expected to live beyond 60 and treatment mainly focuses on alleviating symptoms, such as pain and infections, through blood transfusions and painkillers.

The disease affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., and disproportionately affects African and Hispanic-Americans to a higher degree.

In 2018, President Trump signed into law the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act, a prevention and treatment program that authorizes initiatives for research.  

This year, on August 31, he formally recognized September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month.
