Tottenham have been awarded a bye in the Carabao Cup after their third round tie against Leyton Orient was called off because of an outbreak of Covid-19 at the League Two club.

Tuesday's game at Brisbane Road was called off following an order by Waltham Forest Borough Council after several Orient players tested positive, in tests funded by Spurs.

The EFL have ruled that the win will be awarded to the visitors in accordance with rule 5.1of the competition rules, which covers those teams who do not have sufficient players to fulfil a fixture.

Jose Mourinho's side advance to a fourth round tie with London rivals Chelsea on Tuesday next week.

An outbreak of coronavirus within the Orient squad caused Tuesday's game to be called off  

Orient hoped to reschedule the match - which would have earned them £150,000 in television and sponsorship revenue - but the EFL has decided Spurs will advance.

An EFL statement read: 'In accordance with Carabao Cup Rules, Tottenham Hotspur have been awarded with a bye to progress to Round Four of the Carabao Cup and will now play Chelsea on Tuesday 29 September.

'The Round Three tie scheduled for Tuesday 22 September between Leyton Orient and Tottenham Hotspur could not take place following the issue by Waltham Forest Borough Council of an order preventing the match being played as planned. 

'This followed a number of Leyton Orient players testing positive for COVID-19.

'The EFL Board has determined that in line with Carabao Cup Rule 5.1, the Club was unable to fulfil its obligations to complete the fixture by virtue of the Council's order and shall therefore forfeit the tie.' 

Orient's league fixture against Walsall on Saturday has been postponed as a result of the positive Covid-19 cases.  

Tottenham fans did their bit to help Orient recoup some of the lost revenue from the game, spending over £20,000 on merchandise in the club shop.

Spurs striker Harry Kane, who had a loan spell at Orient back in 2011, is also sponsoring the club's shirts this season. 

The decision to call off Tuesday night's game helped Jose Mourinho and his squad, who played a Europa League qualifier against Shkendija in Macedonia on Thursday night, winning 3-1.

But they face a fixture pile-up next week with Tuesday night's clash with Chelsea swiftly followed on Thursday by a home Europa League play-off game with Maccabi Haifa.
