A Christmas boat parade that gives punters a chance to take in spectacular lighting designs has been cancelled due to crowd size concerns.

The Mooloolaba Yacht Club host the Christmas Boat Parade on the Queensland Sunshine Coast every year. 

But Josh Close, event organiser, said they were forced to make the difficult decision to say goodbye to the event this year because of COVID-19.

The event sees 30,000 people line the river bank to watch boats with incredible displays such as Santa's reindeer.

Homes along the river bank also put in a tremendous effort to create an atmosphere for the occasion. 

'It's about the control of the spectator crowd,' Mr Close said.

'We don't have a lot of control over that.

'To be a COVID safe event we don't have the numbers and resources to manage people in the public areas that we would be required to do.'

The event is expected to go ahead in 2021 - with a date set for December 18.

Josh Close, event organiser, said it was a difficult decision to say goodbye to the annual past time but said it needed to be done during COVID-19

'This this has not been an easy decision for Mooloolaba Yacht Club. We very much look forward to delivering once again a bigger and better parade in 2021,' Mr Close said. 

Mr Close said he is looking for suggestions from the community about activities that can be held on the waterfront for the 2021 parade.  

'A lot of spectators get into place quite early and they get a bit edgy with nothing happening so something going past like some of the commercial boats with carolers or Santa, will keep the young ones entertained,' Mr Close said.
