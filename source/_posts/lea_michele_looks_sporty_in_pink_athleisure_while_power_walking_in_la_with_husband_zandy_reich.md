She gave birth to her first child a little over a month ago.

And Lea Michele showed off her fit post-baby body on Saturday as she and her husband Zandy Reich, 37, went for a brisk walk in Los Angeles' tony Brentwood neighborhood.

The 34-year-old Glee star showed off her fit figure in a set of activewear, including a pale pink tank top.

Lea highlighted her toned legs in a set of black leggings, and she matched them with her simple black trainers.

The singer and actress kept her long brunette tresses tied back in a ponytail, and she blocked out the sun with a stylish pair of military-style square aviator sunglasses.

Zandy, a fashion industry executive, wore a mottled gray–blue T-shirt with gray shorts and gray athletic shoes.

Both Lea and he wore black masks to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, and they appeared to be keeping plenty of distance from others.

Sitting out their morning exercise was their new baby boy Ever Leo, whom Lea gave birth to on August 20.

Lea and Zandy announced they were expecting their first child on May 2, after marrying in March 2019 following two years of dating. 

On Friday, the Spring Awakening star shared a lovely throwback photo from just before the baby arrived.

The black and white image featured Lea showing off her baby bump in a bikini while floating peacefully at the surface of a body of water.

'The day before I met you,' she captioned it.

Last week, Lea shared another sweet photo, this time of her cuddling up with her baby, who was swaddled and strapped to her chest.

'These moments,' she captioned the bonding session.

Lea's return to social media followed a period this spring and summer where she tried to lay low after her Glee costar Samantha Ware called her out for terrorizing her behind-the-scenes.  

Ware tweeted about Michele: 'Remember when you made my first television gig a living hell?!?! Cause I'll never forget.'

The Spring Awakening star later posted a public apology: 'I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused.'

'We can all grow and change and I have definitely used these past several months to reflect on my own shortcomings,' she concluded.
