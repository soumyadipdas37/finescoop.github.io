Back in May, Samantha revealed that she has finally made some headway for her upcoming nuptials.

Speaking to The Morning Show, she said: 'I actually started the process of planning. I had a few things actually planned then had to put it all on hold because of COVID'.

Samantha went on to reveal: 'We only had one thing – we had a venue, but that is all I will say. It's so much to plan, and I did start it.'  

The star announced her engagement to Pat in January last year.
