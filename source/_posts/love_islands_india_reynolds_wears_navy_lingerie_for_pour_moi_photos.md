India turned this way and that as she pulled off her most seductive poses while showcasing her phenomenal physique and slender pins. 

The TV personality also nailed androgynous chic in another image as she donned a black trouser suit and cheekily flashed her navy bra underneath.

She announced in the social media post: 'Can’t wait to shoot with @pourmoiltd @annafowlerphotog @makeupartistryby__elle this week!! New things coming.' 

Her first collection with Pour Moi was launched in July after India stated she wanted to create an underwear line for 'all shapes and sizes'.  

During a recent interview with New! magazine, India revealed that she struggled to accept her body she was younger, but has found her self-confidence in recent years, declaring that it 'comes from within.'

She said: 'I'm really body confident now, but when I was younger, not so much. I've modelled for over 10 years and it's changed so much from when I first started off, as the models were really different to now. 

'It's definitely given me more confidence in just being myself, rather than trying to look like someone at the casting next to you. 

'[I feel my sexiest] when I've been on holiday and I've got a tan or when I've been working out.'
