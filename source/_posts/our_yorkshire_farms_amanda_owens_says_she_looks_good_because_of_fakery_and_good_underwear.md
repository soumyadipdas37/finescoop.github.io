Our Yorkshire Farm's Amanda Owens has revealed her good looks are down to 'fakery' and 'wearing big underwear'.

The mother-of-nine, 45,  who runs the 2,000-acre tenant farm in Upper Swaledale with her husband Clive, 65, appeared on This Morning today where she revealed how she stays effortlessly composed and always looks good even when doing less than glamorous tasks. 

When complimented on her looks by host Ruth Langsford, Amanda said it was down  to 'fakery, and big underwear'.

The shepherdess, who was joined by eight of her children and their horse, Tony the Pony, on the show also revealed it was James Herriot's book All Creatures Great and Small that inspired her to become a first generation farmer

'Every day is a workout here, I'm always chasing after sheep or children,' she added.

It comes after the series finale of the ratings smash hit Our Yorkshire Farm aired on Tuesday, which saw eldest daughter Raven return from university to spend lockdown with her family and help look after her eight siblings.

And it seems Raven has been enjoying the change of pace at university in the city, where she doesn't have to put up with animals breaking into her room.

Amanda told hosts Ruth and Eamonn Holmes one of their many calves invaded the 19-year-old York St John student's room a few week's ago and stole her underwear, which Raven said would 'never happen' in civilised York.

The shepherdess mother-of-nine said that she doesn't need a workout because running around after sheep all day keeps her active 

The shepherdess, who was joined by eight of her children and their horse, Tony the Pony, on the show also revealed it was James Herriot's book All Creatures Great and Small that inspired her to become a first generation farmer. 

Clive added that it was 'hard graft' on the farm, but they 'take each day as it comes'. 

'It's rough, you gotta be tough to live here, we just think bring it on,' he added.

Raven also said that she enjoys spending time between the farm and the city.

'The farm is always something that I want to do, I don't know if i'll want to do it for the rest of my life but I want that option to be there so I can come in between.' 

They also shared how they filmed the final episode themselves as lockdown was ongoing.

The episode was filmed on iPhones, because the camera crew weren't allowed at the farm in lockdown.

In one adorable scene, they strapped the camera to the head of four-year-old Clemmy, who explored the farm and went wild swimming, much to viewers' delight.

Youngest sibling Nancy also tried out the toddler cam, and donned wellington boots and to trek through the water amid fields of sheep and horses.

 Elsewhere, matriarch Amanda, taught Clemmy how to lamb a sheep, while her other children patrolled the fields to find sheep who have given birth and make sure the newborns survived.

The hit Channel 5 show, which has been the most-watched programme in a 9pm slot for two weeks in a row beating rivals BBC One, ITV and Channel 4, follows the lives of Amanda and Clive Owen, aged 45 and 65 respectively, and their nine children at a remote hill farm in the Yorkshire Dales.

After she delivered the newborn out with her bare hands, the toddler proudly declared: 'This is the first lamb I pulled out!' while her big sister Violet, nine, said she's an old hand at lambing.  

Nine-year-old Violet also appeared on This Morning, tell hosts its 'really exciting to help on the farm.

'It's really exciting when you lamb a sheep because you're helping a sheep when it needs it, you're really kinda witnessing new life,' she said.
