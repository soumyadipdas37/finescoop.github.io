A lot had happened since Lionel Messi last spoke in public. 

Barcelona were beaten 8-2 by Bayern Munich, he told Ronald Koeman he wanted out, he sent a transfer request via burofax to the club, and went on strike missing four training sessions. On Friday he finally broke his silence. 

Sportsmail asked what we learned from his words.

Lionel Messi finally broke his silence following a dramatic transfer saga with Barcelona

How did he come across?

As a passionate Barcelona fan, as a doting dad and husband, and perhaps as slightly legally naïve. He showed how much he cares about the club talking about how he could never take the institution to court. 

He showed his concern for his children revealing how they cried when they were told they could be leaving Barcelona. And displayed a perhaps unrealistic grasp of his contract situation when he spoke about believing that telling his president he wanted to leave many times would be enough to free him from a clause it seems had to be officially activated before June 10.

How will the supporters react?

They will have lapped up the way he made no bones about the root cause of Barcelona's problems being the unpopular president Josep Bartomeu. 

There is no sign of a vote of no confidence managing to bring about early elections and with no supporters in the stadium Bartomeu will almost definitely remain at the helm until March elections. 

Supporters should maybe thank him for one thing – Messi made it quite clear it was Bartomeu going back on his word that stopped him leaving.

What picture did he paint of the club?

The killer line was: 'the truth is that there has been no clear project here for a long time, they juggle and plug holes with no real plan'. 

He portrayed a club being run by men who are making it up as they go along, out of their depth, not true to their word, and not really in control. Most would say it's an accurate picture but the fact that Messi was so candid was striking.

He says he'll give his best, did he look like he believes things really go back to the way they were?

He will now be as eager as anyone to see how Koeman's team lines up. He tried to get behind the new coach but there was a lack of conviction when he said: 'There is a new coach and a new idea. That is good but after that the team has to respond if we are to compete.'

And what about what was not said. No mention of Manchester City.

That was always going to be the case. City kept a safe distance from his dispute with Barcelona, he was never going to bring them into it once his future had been resolved. 

He did speak about the having been reminded of the people on his side and the 'false' people who tried to depict his desired departure as coming down to money. There is no doubt that Guardiola and company are in the first group.

Is this really the end of it now?

It felt like the interview that ended the saga, yes. The only possible epilogue will be Bartomeu coming under increasing pressure to resign. 

But Messi has already made it clear that even if Bartomeu was to step down his board would remain so it would be merely cosmetic change.
