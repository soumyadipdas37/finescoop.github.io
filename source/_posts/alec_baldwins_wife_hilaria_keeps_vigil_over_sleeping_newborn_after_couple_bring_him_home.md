She gave birth Tuesday night to her fifth child with husband Alec Baldwin.

And on Thursday night, Hilaria Baldwin shared images to her Instagram Story showing her keeping watch over the sleeping newborn.

'Just hanging because I know he will be up to feed soon,' the 36-year-old shared.

She shared that she and the baby, a son called Eduardo, had put his older siblings to bed and walked the dogs. 

And she acknowledged that, 48 hours after delivery, she is a 'tired mama'.

Hilaria and Alec, 62, brought their son home from the hospital just on Thursday morning.

He is a younger brother to the couple's daughter Carmen, seven, and sons Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two.

Hilaria explained she had to change the infant's clothing before they left the hospital for home because he had an accident early on.

'He peed on his first going home outfit,' she said in her caption. 'So we changed.' 

She explained on Instagram Stories that her children already met the newborn on Facetime. 

It's not yet know if the couple, who suffered two miscarriages before welcoming little Eduardo, will try to get pregnant again.

They have publicly stated that they really want a second daughter and will continue trying until that happens.  

30 Rock star Alec is also a father to daughter Ireland, 24, whom he shares with ex-wife Kim Basinger.
