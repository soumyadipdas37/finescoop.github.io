They were spotted together for the first time earlier this.

And Taylor Hill and her boyfriend Daniel Fryer looked more loved-up than ever as they enjoyed a relaxing beach stroll in Venice, Italy, during the 77th Film Festival.

The Victoria's Secret Angel, 24, put on a leggy display in a pair of black shorts as she packed on the PDA with the businessman.

Taylor teamed the item of clothing with a loose-fitting white T-shirt which teased a glimpse of her black sports bra.

Adding some glamorous touches, she opted for a brown Yves Saint Laurent handbag. 

Taylor styled her brunette locks into a relaxed plaited hairdo and she appeared to go makeup-free, displaying her radiant complexion.

The model took cautious measures amid the Covid-19 crisis as she wore a white face mask.

Meanwhile her boyfriend Daniel went shirtless in a pair of blue patterned swimming shorts, which he teamed with a black baseball cap and grey T-shirt.

Taylor jetted into Venice earlier this week and on Wednesday night she attended the socially-distanced opening ceremony. 

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

Taylor and her boyfriend Daniel were first spotted together in March. The model reportedly split with former boyfriend Michael Stephen Shank earlier this year after dating since 2015, reports Us Weekly.

Daniel is a principal at Cannatlantic, a London-based strategic advisory firm focusing on the global cannabis industry.

He's also the head of Arcadian Europe, another firm working on the growth of the cannabis industry. 

Taylor is an Illinois native, who grew up in Colorado, and was discovered by a fashion photographer when she was just 14. 

She kickstarted her modelling career by being featured in an Intimissimi's catalogue in 2013, which led to a print campaign in Forever 21.

Since then, she went on to become a popular Victoria's Secret Angel, beginning in 2015, and has appeared in many of the top high-fashion publications and fashion shows around the world.
