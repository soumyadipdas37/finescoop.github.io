'I'm literally living in six outfits, I've got two pairs of jeans that I bought from Zara that are like a paper bag and four tight dresses, the ones that are really stretchy.

'And honestly your responses and little tips have been amazing I really feel like it is like a little community on here and I love it lol.'
