Tommy Lee and wife Brittany Furlan headed out on electric bikes over the weekend, seen zipping through traffic in Los Angeles.

The pair chose not to wear crash helmets for their outing, both spotted in shades as they rode along.

Tommy, 57, looked like his usual rocker self, in a black T-shirt and shorts, with a beanie hat, neck chains and flip-flops rounding off the look.

His wife, 33, wore a black top with a khaki jacket, mustard skirt and bright red pumps.

She swept her blonde mane back from her features as she navigated the roads.

In June, Tommy admitted he's now 'actually having fun being silly' after initially being 'dragged onto TikTok' by Brittany.

In an interview with Today Extra, the former Mötley Crüe rocker explained: 'It's all my wife's fault because she has millions of followers on there. She's always doing crazy stuff!' 

'Fun and silly!' Tommy Lee, 57, has expressed he's now 'actually having fun being silly' on TikTok after initially being 'dragged onto it' by wife Brittany Furlan, 33

TikTok has become the latest social media craze thanks to its viral dance challenges and comedy skits.

And hosts David Campbell and Belinda Russell couldn't resist pointing out that Tommy had jumped on board the TikTok bandwagon to promote his new music material. 

The star explained: 'You know what, Tiktok is really fun and it lets everybody like be their own director, producer of their own little clips. You see funny dances, Apple phone hacks. It's nice and silly. 

'At first I thought "No, this is silly". But then it is all my wife's fault because she has millions and millions of followers on there. And she's a comedian and what have you. She is always doing crazy stuff!'

'Fun is what we need right now!' After initial reservations, Tommy has now become TikTok's most unlikely new star

Tommy elaborated further: 'For some reason she dragged me into it. At first I was kind of like "I don't know about all this. I am not that kind of guy." Now I am actually having fun with it!'

The hitmaker is certainly getting a crash course in social media from the best, as his wife Brittany was previously the most followed female video star on the social media network Vine until November 2015.

'Yes, it is silly and it is a whole lot of fun which we need right now!' Tommy added about TikTok.
