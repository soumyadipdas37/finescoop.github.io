Former Big Brother star Krystal Forscutt is in labour with her third child.

The heavily pregnant 34-year-old made the tough decision to be induced on Friday because her doctor will be away on the weekend.

Despite wanting her son to arrive naturally, Krystal seemed optimistic as she documented her progress with fans on Instagram.

Krystal, who is almost 41 weeks pregnant, began by uploading several photos of herself in a blue hospital gown.

She then shared footage of herself squatting off the side of the hospital bed in order to speed up the labour process.

'Didn't work last time but I can try,' she said.

Krystal also shared a video of her 'nervous' husband, Neil Hipwell, eating voraciously to cope with the stress of waiting for his son to arrive. 

'I'm bouncing around on the ball while Neil eats I think his fourth meal for today. He's literally just eating everything,' she said.

'He's eating his nerves, apparently!'

At about 1pm, Krystal spoke of 'the calm before the storm' as she tried to 'get contractions without the oxytocin drip'.

'Tried to see if I could get contractions going without the oxytocin drip but no luck, she said on Instagram Stories.

'I'm now on a low dosage of it to get the contractions going... also opted for no pain relief, hoping I can go all the way without.'

Earlier on Friday, Krystal had announced on Instagram that it was 'baby day'.

She posted a black-and-white photo of Neil and their two children, five-year-old son Sunny and one-year-old daughter Nakoda, touching her baby bump. 

'I can't believe we're about to become a family of five... feeling anxious, scared but most of all I'm so excited to finally meet him #wishmeluck,' Krystal wrote.

She also uploaded a picture of herself posing in the mirror and saying 'bye bye' to her bump.

Earlier this week, Krystal shared her struggle with deciding to go ahead with being induced. 

Krystal said the decision was driven by some complications from the birth of her second child in 2018.

She made the call on Wednesday after learning that her doctor was going to be away for the weekend.

It also followed a number of failed attempts to induce labour naturally.

'I just wanted him there, obviously with what happened last time with my hemorrhage,' she told her Instagram followers.

'I would feel more secure if he was there on the day that I'm going to be giving birth. I've had to make a call and not feeling great about it.'

Krystal revealed she was expecting her third child in March, but was told by doctors to be 'cautiously optimistic' about the pregnancy.

She almost suffered a miscarriage at 13 weeks, which would have been her third if complications persisted.

Fortunately, Krystal and the baby pulled through and the family are eager to welcome their new addition.
