Appearing on Good Morning Britain today, he revealed how to improve your mood amid the coronavirus pandemic, advising 'finding a daily habit' which brings you peace

Speaking of mental health during the pandemic, Jay said: 'One of the most important things is to realise that everyone has lost something or someone, and it's really important not to gloss over that and belittle it and to really accept it. 

'The second thing is to see how you can find certainty in your day. What is a daily habit or a ritual that you can do that brings you a sense calm? 

'Whether it's a morning tea or reading or listening to something that calms you down, finding a daily habit that brings you that peace.' 

He went on to explain how he refrains from toxic habits, advising replacing your habit with something else that brings joy.

'One of the best ways [to avoid bad habits] is to give yourself a really strong reason, that item is not there to serve you', said Jay. 

'Whatever that vice or challenge is for you, you can keep drawing your mind back. 

'The goal is you can't just remove something, you need to remove it for something that's healthier but gives you the same feeling.' 

Viewers were quick to comment on the author, with one writing: 'Good to see @JayShettyIW on @GMB this morning! #ThinkLikeAMonk #PositiveVibes'. 

Another commented: 'Jay shetty is amazing, such an inspiration. He has helped me so much and I'm looking forward to reading his book. If you need guidance this man is the man to steer you in the right direction. If you want mind and soul reprogramming he's a genius. Love him.'

A third gushed: 'SO HAPPY JAY IS ON THE SHOW!Red heart SO MUCH WISDOM.'  

Jay first heard a monk speak at the age of 21, and for the next three years spent half his summer vacations working for a large financial firms and the other half living as a monk in India. 

After three years of back-and-forth, Jay committed to living the life of a Monk full time, for for another three years lived with monks, woke up at 4 am, meditated for 4-8 hours, studied timeless wisdom and served others in nearby communities. 

After leaving the monastery, Jay began sharing lessons on mental health and life purpose on social media, and told today how he was inspired to use his life 'in the service of others'. 

When asked by host Piers about his success in business, the former monk went on: 'I think to me it's been an unravelling of getting to my truest and most authentic self'

'The most important moments in life are always humbling ones, said Jay,  'When you go expecting nothing and you realise how stupid and immature you were.

'When at 18 , I had met people who were rich and famous and attractive but i'd never met someone who was truly happy and the Monk said he was happy because he was using his life in the service of others.' 

When asked by host Piers Morgan about his success in business, the former monk went on: 'I think to me it's been an unravelling of getting to my truest and most authentic self. 

'Since i've left, i've put those practises into the real world and put my life into applying that. I just feel grateful and blessed and humble I live the life I live.'
