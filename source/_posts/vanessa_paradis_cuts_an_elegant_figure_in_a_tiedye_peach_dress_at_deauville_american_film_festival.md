Vanessa showcased her slender physique as she posed in the dress which boasted a tie-dye print with pastel shades of peach, pink and yellow.

The ex-girlfriend of actor Johnny Depp certainly made a statement in the dress as it boasted an asymmetrical hem with a feathered trim.

Vanessa completed her red carpet look with gold heels that boasted 60s-inspired black toes and a bow ankle strap, and her honey tresses styled into loose waves.

The Deauville American Film Festival is a yearly celebration dedicated to films from US cinema, and is held in the French city of the same name, and this year Vanessa has been appointed President of the Jury.

Vanessa's appearance comes after her testimony in her ex Johnny's libel case was cancelled last month.

The star, who was in a relationship with Johnny for more than 14 years and had two children with him, had been expected to give evidence in support of the Pirates Of The Caribbean star's case over a videolink.

But the court was told that there was no need for her - or his ex-fiancee in the 1990s, actress Winona Ryder - to give evidence because Depp's claim that he has never hit a woman was only tested by the defence regarding Amber Heard.

However their bombshell statements were released by the court, showing both stood faithfully by his side. Winona said she was 'absolutely shocked, confused and upset' by the allegations against him.

She added in her statement, provided in advance of the trial: 'The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved.

'I cannot wrap my head around these accusations. He was never, never violent towards me. He was never, never abusive at all towards me. He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen,' she added.

Johnny is suing The Sun publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) and its executive editor over an April 2018 article which alleged he was violent towards ex-wife Amber, 34, during their tumultuous relationship.
