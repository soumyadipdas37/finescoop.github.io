Kerry Washington and the star-studded cast of The Prom recently wrapped shooting for the upcoming musical comedy film during the COVID pandemic.

With some free time on her hands, and the coronavirus still raging in Los Angeles, Kerry Washington enjoyed a sun-soaked Monday relaxing in a pool in a stylish bikini while floating on a butterfly raft.

'#MondayMotivation = @MariahCarey ….duh,' the Scandal star, 43, wrote in a caption of her angelic-looking photo that was a direct nod of respect to the five-time Grammy-winning singer and her 1997 Butterfly album and song.

Being that social media users typically use the hashtag #MondayMotivation to post positive messages, quotes and photos on a Monday, Carey wasted little time in returning a compliment back to Washington.

'#EveningMotivation (night owl) = binge watching scandal as Olivia Pope wears the white hat and rules the world. *Willing it into existence* LOVE YOU!' Carey, 51, wrote in reference to her political thriller series that ran from 2012-2018, along with three red heart emojis.

In the photo, Washington has a look of contentment on her face as she floats in the pool and the sun beams down on her face.

The New York City native also took to her Insta-Story on Monday and shared a photo of the cast of The Prom that shows herself posing alongside the likes of director Ryan Murphy and co-stars Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Keegan-Michael Key and James Corden.

Filming was suspended in March when COVID-19 was deemed a pandemic, and eventually resumed shooting in late July.

The Prom tells the story of a troupe of 'self-obsessed' theater stars that arrive to a small town in Indiana to support a high school girl who wants to take her girlfriend to prom. 

It is slated to premiere later this year, likely in time for the holiday season.

Washington also took to her Insta-Story on Monday and shared a quick clip of herself where she asks her six million followers to' tag someone who is the kindest human being.'

The actress tagged Bellamy Young as the her choice for being the kindest human being. She played Melody Grant on Scandal, alongside Washington, for the seven season it aired on ABC.
