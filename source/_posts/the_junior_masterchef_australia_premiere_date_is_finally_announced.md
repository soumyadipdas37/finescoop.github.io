Junior MasterChef Australia is making a welcome return to TV, almost 10 years after it went off the air.

The third season of the MasterChef spin-off series will see 14 of the nation's youngest cooks showcase their extraordinary culinary talents. 

On Monday, Channel Ten announced that the latest season will premiere on Sunday, October 11 at 7.30pm.

MasterChef judges Jock Zonfrillo, Melissa Leong and Andy Allen will also feature in the series. 

On Friday, Melissa shared her excitement for the latest season of Junior MasterChef, which is set to return after being axed in 2011.

'What's that? @jrmasterchefau has officially announced its launch date? And there's a cockatoo on my head?' she captioned an Instagram post.

'Why yes! See you back on screen OCTOBER 11 @channel10au with a host of the most inspiring mini MasterChefs! I can't wait for you to meet them.' 

Contestants for this year's season include Ruby, Etka, Laura, Porsha, Tiffany, Ben, Salvo, Filo, Georgia, Dev, Phenix, Carter and Vienna, with all aged between nine and 14.

It also includes the son of former MasterChef Australia winner Sashi Cheliah, 11-year-old Ryan.

The young boy was a familiar face on the hit cooking show in 2018, standing alongside his father during a family reunion.

Despite this, Sashi is adamant the young, aspiring cook was not recognised by producers until the first stage of the casting process on Junior MasterChef Australia.

'I put in an application and then they called for an audition. So it's only after the audition that they realised Ryan is my son,' Sashi said, as reported by HuffPost Australia last week.

But Ryan is keen to make a name for himself in the culinary world, instead of being simply known as 'Sashi's son'. 

'People are going to know me for me, Ryan, instead of, "Oh that's Sashi's son",' the young cook told HuffPost Australia. 

'My favourite thing to cook is a fish curry. Even though it may be a bit complicated, it's full of flavour and I really like eating it.'

Professional baker Reece Hignell, who competed on the latest season of MasterChef Australia, offered a few words of advice to the upcoming contestants on Monday.

'Okay, so all of those people in MasterChef Junior, if you are baking, I just want to say that the blast chiller is your best friend,' Reece, 30, said in a video uploaded to Instagram.

'Like if you need to cool a cake, if you need to chill an ice cream, parfait, a mousse... chuck anything into that blast chiller and get it nice and cold.'
