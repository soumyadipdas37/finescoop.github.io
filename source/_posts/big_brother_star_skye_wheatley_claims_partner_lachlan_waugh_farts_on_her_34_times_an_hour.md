Skye Wheatley paid tribute to partner Lachlan Waugh for Father's Day on Sunday. 

However, the 26-year-old did so in a rather strange way - by outing his chronic flatulence. 

Alongside a photo collage of the pair together, the former Big Brother star wrote: 'Happy Father's Day to my best friend full of gas (been coping about 3-4 farts in the space of an hour from this guy). 

What? Skye Wheatley paid tribute to partner Lachlan Waugh for Father's Day on Sunday. Alongside a photo collage of the pair, she wrote: ' Happy Father's Day to my best friend full of gas (been coping about 3-4 farts in the space of an hour from this guy).' Both pictured 

'And to most adoring, loving and caring father. Watching you be the best daddaaa to forest warms my heart. 

'Thanks for making an effort to put the washing machine on even though you've stained all my whites with a direct hit of softener, cleaning the kitchen when I'm too exhausted and making sure Forest is never in a wet nappy. 

'I love you stinky man. Time to get mine and Forest's name tattooed on that sexy dad bod,' she concluded. 

Happy family: Skye shared a second set of photos of the pair with their son, Forest, one, enjoying a 'staycation' at the Sheraton Grand Mirage Resort on the Gold Coast for Father's Day

Love: After sharing what she called 'banter' regarding flatulence, Skye also said Lachlan is 'the most adoring, loving and caring father' 

The blonde beauty went on to insist the comments were just 'banter' and fans should not be upset by them.   

Skye shared a second set of photos of the pair with their son, Forest, one, enjoying a 'staycation' at the Sheraton Grand Mirage Resort on the Gold Coast for Father's Day.
