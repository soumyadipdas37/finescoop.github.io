She is set to make her Bond debut in the eagerly-anticipated No Time To Die.

And Ana de Armas proved she has all the makings of the character as she showcased her epic moves in the new trailer released on Thursday.

The Cuban-Spanish actress, 32, is seen fly kicking an enemy in the teaser which also sees Daniel Craig, 52, looking brooding as ever as he comes face to face with chilling villain Safin, portrayed by Rami Malek, 39.

She's got the moves: Ana de Armas proved she has all the makings of a Bond Girl as she showcased her epic moves in the new trailer released on Thursday

In the clip, fans of the franchise are also given a better look at Ana's character CIA Agent Paloma who Bond meets in Santiago and '00' agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch). 

Throwing herself wholeheartedly into the action, Ana is seen dazzling in a plunging evening gown with dripping diamonds - yet does not let her get-up stop the action.

As she became embroiled in a wild fight, the gun-toting beauty wastes no time hurtling through the air and kicking her enemies.  

Elsewhere, the nail-biting video opens with 007 narrowly avoiding being hit by a car before smashing into a wall as he embarks on one of his most dangerous missions.

Shots fired! She was shooting guns and firing through the air 

Where have you been? Agent Paloma scolds Bond for being late before her fight 

Set to the iconic Bond theme song, fans are re-introduced to villain Blofeld, played by Christoph Waltz, who sits in a cage in a prison cell.

He tells Bond: 'James, fate draws us back together and now your enemy is my enemy', with the nemesis in question being none other than Safin. 

In the trailer, 007 is told of the danger Safin presents by Madeleine Swann, (Lea Seydoux) who tells him that he is after 'revenge' and her, suggesting her life will be in danger if his plans come to pass.

Kicking off: She was ready to be taken on 

A vision: Fellow Bond girl Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) was seen weeping 

he's out: Safin appears to see a degree of similarity between himself and 007 as he is overheard eerily proclaiming: 'James Bond, we both eradicate people to try and make the world a better place. I just want to be a little...tidier'

High speed! The film was jam-packed with action with car chases upping the drama

Shots fired! Bond's car was equipped with guns inside the headlights 

British star Lashana Lynch, will be given Bond's licence to kill in the 25th movie in the franchise. She's not the new Bond, but a new character who takes over his secret agent number after he leaves MI6.

Nomi is clearly a force to be reckoned with as Bond refers to her as a 'disarming young woman' after she attempts to shoot him.

Meanwhile, Paloma is seen scolding Bond for being late for his meeting with her before she fights off a group of men while wearing a black evening dress.  

Safin appears to see a degree of similarity between himself and 007 as he is overheard eerily proclaiming: 'James Bond, we both eradicate people to try and make the world a better place. I just want to be a little...tidier.'

Several action scenes follow as Bond and Nomi find themselves in a jet with him asking her: 'Have you ever flown one of these before?' to which she says: 'Nope'.

Bond is seen driving a motorcycle up a hill as he leaps above a crowd of pedestrians as he is heard saying: 'If we don't do this, there will be nothing left to save'. 

The trailer's exhilarating conclusion sees Bond armed with a gun in the woods as a truck drives full speed towards him before he manages to dive out of the way before firing at the driver. 

The video's tagline reads: 'This November, the mission that changes everything begins'. 

No Time To Die will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20.
