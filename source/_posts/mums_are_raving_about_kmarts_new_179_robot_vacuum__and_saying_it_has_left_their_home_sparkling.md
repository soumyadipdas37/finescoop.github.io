Mums are raving about a new $179 robot vacuum from Kmart, saying it has left their homes sparkling after just one clean.

One shopper posted about her experience with the discount vacuum on Facebook, where she said she has been 'super impressed' with the results.

'For those wanting reviews on the robot vacuum I'm super impressed - and for the price you can't go wrong!' the woman posted Tammy wrote.  

'$179 and I'm in western Australia. Also, I should add that this is only from one bedroom which I vacuumed this morning!'

Tammy accompanied her post with two photos, both of the vacuum and how much dirt and grime it had managed to pick up. 

The mum from WA wasn't the only big fan of Kmart's new product.

Others described the vacuum as 'a bit noisy', but a 'fantastic buy'.

'I love it. It has three cleaning settings and I can relate as I have three kids,' one woman posted.

'I'm a fan. Seems to run fine from floor to over rugs,' another added.

Kmart Australia launched the new self-charging robotic vacuum cleaner for just $179 at the end of last month, in perfect time for spring cleaning.

It features three cleaning modes, self charging and a brushless motor similar to gadgets that will often set you back hundreds of dollars more. 

When battery power gets low, the robot automatically returns to its charging dock and recharges all by itself - no human intervention required.

The product includes many of the features you would expect with regular robot vacuum cleaners - and it's suitable for just about every room in every house.

The new launch comes just days after Aldi Australia announced it's bringing back its high-end 'smart' robotic vacuum cleaner on Saturday, September 5.  

The Deebot Ozmo 900 robot hit shelves for just $399 just months after it sold out within 60 seconds of launching. 

Not only can the model vacuum, mop and sweep, the gadget features a mapping system that allows users to customise areas of their home they want cleaned.
