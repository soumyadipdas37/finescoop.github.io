DESIGNING HISTORY  

By Michael S. Smith (Rizzoli, £40)

Designing History, by Michael S. Smith (Rizzoli, £40)

When Michael Smith renovated the Obama White House, his brief was to create an interior suitable for a political office and a family home. 

In the Yellow Oval Room, for example — pictured with Barack and Michelle entertaining then Italian premier Matteo Renzi and wife Agnese — he kept the wall colour, chosen by Jackie Kennedy, but included the metal toys (see left) as a nod to the Obamas' playful side. 

With a foreword from Michelle, this fascinating book is the ultimate look through the keyhole.
