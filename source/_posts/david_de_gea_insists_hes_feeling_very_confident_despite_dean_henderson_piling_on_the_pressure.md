David De Gea has brushed aside fears over his confidence, insisting he is in top shape and ready to fight Dean Henderson for his starting place.  

The Manchester United keeper's shocker in 2019-20 featuring costly howlers against Tottenham and Chelsea have put the man formerly known as the world's best keeper in jeopardy of losing his place. 

The Spaniard started Unite'd opening day 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last weekend but more slip-ups could see 23-year-old Henderson steal his spot, having returned from an impressive Sheffield United loan.  

David De Gea is determined to keep his starting spot as Manchester United's No.1 this season 

The Spaniard's dreadful 2019-20 has seen him come under pressure from Dean Henderson 

De Gea kept his placed for United'd dour 3-1 defeat on the opening day the Premier League 

'I feel very, very well and very confident and very positive and that's very important for me,' the Spaniard told manutd.com.  

'Now it's time to be back to winning ways and winning trophies, that's the most important thing for us at the moment. Like I say I feel very, very good.

'It's great to train every day here with the coaches and the goalkeepers. 

'We always try to learn from each other and try to push altogether. It's great. If you see the training it's really good to see the goalkeepers together.

Henderson's time on-loan at Sheffield United showed the keeper's quality at just 23-years-old

'It's very important to have good feelings with the other goalkeepers and the goalkeeping coaches as well. It's great. 

'We are training, like I say, very, very well – the whole department of keepers. We need to be at this level every day and to show the players that the keepers are feeling 100%. Now like I said we have to go for trophies.'  

United's dreadful start to 2020-21 will need to be bettered at Brighton on Saturday, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side with Graham Potter's side having set off strongly.
