One young man was stabbed to death and two others are fighting for life after a horrific brawl between feuding Sudanese gangs broke out in Brisbane.  

Emergency crews rushed to O'Callaghan Park in Zillmere at 5.35pm on Sunday following a fight between two groups. 

It's believed one of the groups was sitting in the park when the other group arrived and the altercation was sparked.

Some of the people involved are believed to have fled the scene when police arrived.

Police confirmed a man aged approximately 20 years old died, while 10 others were injured. 

Emergency crews were called to O'Callaghan Park in Zillmere at about 5.35pm on Sunday following a fight between two African gangs.

Locals of the northern Brisbane suburb said they heart the sound of breaking bottles and saw 'bodies on the ground just lying there'

Locals of the northern Brisbane suburb said they heard the sound of breaking bottles and saw 'bodies on the ground just lying there', The Courier Mail reported.  

The witness said he saw one of the men on top of the other while stabbing him, before taking off when he saw the neighbour.   

Another bystander said she saw a group of men walking near the park wearing black hooded jumpers and masks.

Police said the bloody brawl, which involved knives and baseball bats, may have been retribution between two African gangs over another incident earlier this week in the western suburbs.

Detective Superintendent Tony Fleming said there was a 'disturbance' at the Royal Brisbane And Women's Hospital involving families of the victims at about 10pm.  

Police then forcibly restrained at least one person after a second altercation broke out after 11pm at the same hospital.

'We are looking for witnesses and we are looking for people with information to assist us,' he said.

'We are in the preliminary stages of this investigation and what we would ask if for the community to remain calm.' 

Extra police are now patrolling the Brisbane hospitals where the victims are being treated. 

Queensland Police have established multiple crime scenes including one at the Zillmere PCYC.  

Police have confirmed one death and multiple injuries resulted from the altercation on Sunday afternoon at O'Callaghan Park (pictured) in Zillmere
