Keeley Hawes has been no stranger to playing steely police officers during her stellar career. But her latest role as a real-life detective who brought five killers to justice has affected her more than ever before.

So much so that Keeley cannot help but be moved to tears when she describes the importance of honouring the life of Banaz Mahmod, who was murdered aged 20 on the orders of her own family because she ended an abusive forced marriage and started a relationship with a man of her own choosing.

Her father, uncle and two cousins were later convicted of her murder.

ITV’s new two-part drama Honour tells the powerful story of DCI Caroline Goode’s passionate search to discover the fate of Banaz, an Iraqi-Kurdish woman from south London, after she disappeared.

DCI Goode discovered that Banaz had been to the police five times to report threats to her life from members of her own family. Appalled that her own colleagues had missed chances to save a young woman’s life, Caroline vowed that she would not rest until she finally got justice for Banaz.

‘We were all so mindful that we were dealing with real people, so probably more than anything I’ve ever worked on the responsibility was huge. I felt it every day and I’ve felt it every day since. I really have. Sorry, that was unexpected…’ says Keeley, pausing as she tries to hold back tears. ‘You want to do the right thing by everyone involved and to give Banaz the utmost respect.’

The show’s writer Gwyneth Hughes conducted detailed interviews with as many real-life people as possible, including Banaz’s boyfriend Rahmat Sulemani, her sister Bekhal and Caroline and her former team. ‘The whole team came to set one day and watched a bit of filming, which was nerve-racking,’ recalls Keeley, 44, who has previously played Detective Inspectors Alex Drake in Ashes To Ashes and Lindsay Denton in Line Of Duty.

‘They were determined to get justice for Banaz. To find her body and extradite two of the guilty men from Iraq, which had never been done before. Not a moment went by when we weren’t talking or thinking about Banaz. I still find it emotional today.

When the story begins, Banaz is already dead but the police don’t yet know that. On 25 January 2006, she was reported missing by her new boyfriend Rahmat, but the police didn’t take it seriously. Her parents portrayed themselves as easy-going, claiming that Banaz often stayed out overnight. But Rahmat persisted until the police took action.

In reality, the previous day Banaz’s parents had left the family home, leaving Banaz asleep in the lounge. On the orders of her father Mahmod Mahmod and uncle Ari Mahmod, two of her cousins and another man went to the house and raped and tortured her before strangling her and stuffing her body in a suitcase, which they buried in a garden in Birmingham. It was found three months later.

At the beginning Keeley knew little about honour crimes, so seeing real-life police videos of Banaz (re-created for the TV series) was devastating. In them we see a terrified woman telling an officer her life is in danger and asking the haunting question, ‘What can you do for me?’ ‘I sat in stunned silence,’ says Keeley. ‘Banaz is so vulnerable in them, both mentally and physically fragile. But she’s extraordinary because she has such strength at the same time.’

Banaz was ten when her family came to the UK and at 17 she had an arranged marriage to a man who abused her. She later left him and went back to live with her family. That act put her in danger, but starting a relationship with Rahmat sealed her fate. When they were spotted together, Banaz’s father arranged her murder.

Honour is not only a tribute to Banaz, but also her sister Bekhal, who is still in witness protection after risking her life to testify. Rahmat was in witness protection too, but tragically killed himself in 2016, having never really recovered.

‘If just one person feels they can reach out to a charity, or sees that what they are going through is not normal because of this drama, then the whole endeavour will have been worthwhile,’ says Keeley.
