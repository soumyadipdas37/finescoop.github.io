Mystery surrounds the identity of a woman whose body was found in the ornamental lake in front of Kensington Palace last weekend.

The body was removed from the Round Pond last Saturday and the family of artist Endellion Lycett Green were previously told the corpse was hers in a case of mistaken identity.

Endellion, who lives in Wiltshire with her husband and two children, was missing for a week but has been found alive.

Police today said there are no further updates and inquiries are ongoing to establish the female's identity.

Endellion's brother, John Lycett Green, earlier told his friends: 'My sister Endellion is alive, safe and well.

'Thank you all for the support and love you showed for Delli and her family.

‘Sorry to all of you that, like us, were grieving for the wonder that is Delli. We were told a body was found and was her. It was not, and Delli was found last night.’

The body was found in the ornamental lake in front of Kensington Palace, where Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge (pictured last month) reside with their children

He added: ‘RIP the soul that was found in Kensington Round Pond on Saturday morning.’

A friend of the family told the Daily Mail: 'Delli went through a bad patch, but it’s a huge relief to everyone that she is safe and well. It’s been a traumatic week.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained at this time, but is not thought to be suspicious. 

'Inquiries are ongoing.’
