Starbucks has delighted fans by announcing the Pumpkin Spice Latte will be available in UK stores from next week.

The popular autumnal drink will be back in UK cafes from 25th September, a month after they appeared on US menus in the earliest ever launch for the sweet beverage.  

The drink is a combination of Starbucks Espresso Roast, pumpkin pie flavoured sauce and steamed milk, topped with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spices – cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.

While Starbucks first launched the drink in the US 17 years ago, British chains have created their own versions in recent years.

Embracing the US trend for autumnal drinks both Pret and Greggs sold a Pumpkin Spice Latte last year, while Costa sold a 'Bonfire Latte'. 

As well as the new menu, Starbucks are also launching a new rewards programme set to launch on 23rd September.

Key features of the new loyalty programme include free drinks when 150 stars are earned. 

Anyone signed up to the scheme will get three points for £1 they spend in store, meaning they will get a free drink for every £50 they spend.

Once a member gets 450 points, they will reach Gold level status meaning they will get a free drink on their birthday month, and free extras including espresso shots, syrups and whipped cream.

Back in 2003, Starbucks created the original Pumpkin Spice Latte. Since then, the beloved fan favourite has grown in popularity year on year.

Over the years, Starbucks has evolved the drink to align with shifting consumer trends, with diverse variations to cater to all preferences, including a vegan option and a cold brew.
