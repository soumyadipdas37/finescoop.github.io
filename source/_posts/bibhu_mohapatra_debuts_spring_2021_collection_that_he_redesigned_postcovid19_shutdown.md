Bibhu Mohapatra debuted his Spring/Summer 2021 collection at New York Fashion Week today. 

Like many creatives, the award-winning CFDA designer experienced a shift in thinking as a result of COVID-19. 

'What I had started creating before the pandemic didn't make sense anymore,' Bibhu told the Daily Mail. To design a collection that felt right, he went back to his roots and sought inspiration from female revolutionary, Amrita Sher-Gil.

Strong women have always been Bibhu's greatest inspiration, and this collection is no different. 

Amrita was an Indian artist who challenged the Indian art scene at the height of the 20th century. Way ahead of her time, Amrita took a bold and daring approach towards her life and work.

This rebellious spirit led her to blaze a trail for future generations of artists, who to this day continue to honor her legacy of iconoclastic expression and challenging the norm.

Power: To design a collection that felt right, he went back to his roots and sought inspiration from female revolutionary, Amrita Sher-Gil

Creatives: To bring the collection to life, Bibhu tapped New York based filmmaker and friend, Shruti Ganguly and photographer JD Urban, who have directed a film celebrating the life of Amrita

Channeling Amrita's fearless spirit, Bibhu's chosen color palette is not for the faint of heart. 

While safe shades like white, nude, light blue and pink are present, so is chartreuse, a bold "look at me" color that is a combination of yellow and green.

'It signifies optimism and bravery and works on all skin tones,' said Bibhu.

The bold hue is featured throughout the 26 piece collection with multiple fabrics including tulle, chantilly lace and crepe.   

Known for his dramatic evening wear and romantic aesthetic, Bibhu did not abandon that in this collection. 

He just changed the ratio of formal wear, designing about 40% less gowns in favor of more casual separates in cotton, twill and denim that can be worn on a zoom call or out for drinks.

'I started getting emails from stores and clients for clothing that can be worn at home events,' he shared with the Daily Mail.

'Even when at home, women still want to feel good about themselves, it was just going to be more relaxed.'   

Of course it wouldn't be a Bibhu Mohapatra collection without embroideries using Indian handwork reminiscent of his childhood, and he didn't disappoint.

Turning in: After spending most of the quarantine upstate (instead of Manhattan) planting a vegetable garden and tending to chickens, Bibhu used this season to dig deeper into the process of change and transformation

After spending most of the quarantine upstate (instead of Manhattan) planting a vegetable garden and tending to chickens, Bibhu used this season to dig deeper into the process of change and transformation.    

To bring the collection to life, the designer tapped New York based filmmaker and friend, Shruti Ganguly and photographer JD Urban, who have directed a film celebrating the life of Amrita. 

They created a 2 minutes 40-second short film celebrating Amrita, as she creates some of her most iconic works and the muses who inspire her. 

The film features Tony-nominated actress and Hamilton alum, Ariana DeBose, the star of the upcoming Spielberg-directed “West Side Story” and Ryan Murphy’s Netflix project “The Prom,” who plays the main Muse. 

The role of Amrita is played by actress Reema Sampat.   

 Entertaining: 'I started getting emails from stores and clients for clothing that can be worn at home events,' he shared with the Daily Mail

A different world: 'To change, we must move, be it awkward, unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and (hopefully) enlightening. Because standing still is no longer an option'

'This moment in history —if we are listening and looking deeply with our whole selves— has the power to permanently shift our perceptions relationships with race, privilege, equity, empathy, and hope, said Bibhu.

He continued: 'Through art, and, in this case, through dance and movement, we can observe how physically—and compassionately confronting barriers and blocks can profoundly push us to reassess, improvise, and find a way forward...in our work, our art, and in ourselves.

'To change, we must move, be it awkward, unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and (hopefully) enlightening. Because standing still is no longer an option.'
