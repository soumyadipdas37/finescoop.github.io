Rumours are swirling that Sunrise weatherman Sam Mac may have quietly split from his girlfriend Elle Whittaker.

The pair are said to have called it quits last month after dating for less than a year.

Despite whispers of a break-up, Sam still follows Elle on Instagram and they appear to be on friendly terms.

Sam has made no secret of the fact his job at Sunrise makes it difficult for him to maintain a long-term relationship.

He reluctantly announced his romance with Elle on Seven's breakfast show in March, when he brought her up during a weather report.

His Sunrise colleagues joked that his girlfriend didn't exist, and he proved that they were in fact together by sharing a photo of the couple on Instagram.

What went wrong? Sam has not alluded to a break-up on social media, but tellingly the pair haven't been pictured together since April 20 (above)

That same month, the popular TV host told the Fitzy & Wippa radio show that he was enjoying spending time with Elle in lockdown. 

'There is definitely a positive to it [staying at home]. I mean, I've got a new girlfriend now so I've got time to actually spend with her,' he said.

'We've only been official since just before isolation. I got her at the pre-isolation sale! I got her just before it all happened.'

Radio host Sarah McGilvray noted that it was 'pretty intense' for the couple to shack up in lockdown, considering they hadn't been together for that long. 

'Yeah, it is a bit intense, but so far so good,' he replied.

Elle has a nine-to-five job as a communications adviser for Qantas, but Sam is often travelling around the country working unsociable hours. 

The 38-year-old, whose real name is Sam McMillan, previously told New Idea: 'A lot of why I'm single is because of my dedication to my work.

'Particularly with this role, the travel means I'm probably only home a couple of days a week.

'It's the sort of role that it's not good to look too far ahead because it is too overwhelming. If I looked at the next two months of my schedule I would be freaking out.'

Dream job: Born in Adelaide, Sam worked in radio and for Channel 10's The Project before replacing Edwina Bartholomew as Sunrise's roving weather presenter in early 2016
