It's been business as usual after production resumed in July.

And Mark Wahlberg was putting on a dapper display in a smart black suit as he prepared to film scenes for the big-screen prequel to the Uncharted games in Berlin, Germany on Monday.

The actor, 49, looked suave as he arrived to film his scenes as Nathan Drake's mentor Victor Sullivan as he stars alongside Tom Holland in the film.

Mark sported a smart black blazer and tie combo as he strolled onto set to film the scenes in the midst of a bustling city.

The crew all ensured they adhered to safety measures by donning protective face masks as they set up the scene.

Mark will take on the role of fortune hunter Victor, who acts as a father figure to young Nathan as they embark on their first adventure.

The Uncharted film will act as a prequel to the four-part game series, which concluded in 2017, and will document Nathan's own journey to adventure as a descendant of the British explorer Sir Francis Drake.

Back in 2010 it was reported that Mark would actually be playing Nathan himself, but as the film was trapped in development hell, it was revealed in May 2017 that Spiderman star Tom had been cast in the leading role.

In November 2019 Mark returned to the project in a new supporting role, and it is set to be released in 2021.

The film will be directed by Ruben Fleischer, who helmed the Zombieland series, 2013's Gangster Squad and 2018's Venom.

Filming for the project began in March, but was halted after just a day due to the COVID-19 outbreak hit, but later resumed in July.

The blockbuster will also star Antonio Banderas, who temporarily left the production last month after testing positive for COVID-19, but has since recovered.
