For these thriving over fifties, it's not just the animals who have benefitted from their meat and dairy free diet.

PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals] has announced its 12 finalists for this year's UK and Ireland's Most Beautiful Vegan Over 50 competition - a twist on the animal rights organisation's popular Hottest Vegan contest.

It's up to the public to decide on the winner, who will be treated to an award-winning 'Les Plantes' vegan tasting menu for two at top London restaurant Gauthier Soho.  

The competition aims to prove 'there's nothing more attractive than compassion', and honours 'venerable vegans who are living, breathing examples of beauty, inside and out', according to PETA director Elisa Allen, who said the remaining contestants are setting 'an admirable example... for younger generations to follow'.
