A man, 50, has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a teenage girl went missing seven weeks ago.

Bernadette Walker, 17, was reported missing from Peterborough on July 21 after she had not been seen for three days.

A 'no body' murder investigation was declared yesterday after all search operations failed, police from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit revealed.

DCI Jerry Waite said: 'Due to the length of time Bernadette has been missing and concerns she may have come to some harm, we made the decision to declare this a murder investigation yesterday morning.

'Whilst we hope we do find Bernadette alive and well, there is every possibility this may not be the case therefore my team and I will do everything possible to find out what has happened to her and bring any offenders to justice.' 

Bernadette is described as medium build with half brown, half gingery blonde hair

A man in his 50s from Peterborough is currently in custody on suspicion of Bernadette's murder.

In August Bernadette's mother Sarah told PeterboroughMatters.com: 'I can't eat or sleep properly. I miss and love my eldest princess so much, she's missing out on her baby sister, who has learned to smile and coo already.'

She revealed she hadn't had any contact from her daughter since 1am on July 20, when Bernadette text her to say she was on her way home.

Bernadette hasn't accessed social media since and no friends have heard from her.

Her family originally thought she may have taken spare clothes with her, but have since found the items under the schoolgirl's bed. 

Bernadette is described as medium build with half brown, half gingery blonde hair.

She has facial piercings and two homemade tattoos.

Anyone with information on Bernadette's whereabouts or what has happened to her is urged to contact police either by using the online webchat function, or by calling 101 and quoting Operation Penshaw.
