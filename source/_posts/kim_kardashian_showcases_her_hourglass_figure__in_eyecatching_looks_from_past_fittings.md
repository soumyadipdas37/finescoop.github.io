She is set to celebrate the one year anniversary of her loungewear/undergarment brand Skims on September 10.

And days prior to the happy occasion, Kim Kardashian took a walk down memory lane with one of her favorite high fashion designers, Manfred Thierry Mugler.

The 39-year-old reality star/entrepreneur posted an appreciation post for him, sharing four different looks she tried on during fittings with the iconic designer.

Kim captioned the slideshow: 'Just a @manfredthierrymugler appreciation post! I was honored to be able to try on and wear so many different looks of his so just had to share some of his magic and these fitting pics. Love you Manfred.'

The first image in the slideshow featured Kim in a vintage two piece set by Mugler, highlighting her slim waist and her famous curves.

She was posing for the fittings photo in a room with racks of clothes; her hair was pulled back and she went makeup free.

Kim also posted the original runway photo of a model wearing the look.

Another dress she rocked was a silver skintight number that showcased her ample cleavage and her tiny waist. 

The beauty shared a throwback snap of a model wearing the dress on the runway, along with a snap of a model rocking a black number, which is from Mugler's Spring/Summer 1998 collection.

Another look by Mugler Kim tried on was a sheer gold and nude jumpsuit, with a turquoise cover up.

The mother of four censored the photo herself, marking over her chest area, which was completely see through.

The one-piece had gold spots all over and nude colored underwear; she showed the front and back look of the glamorous look. 

Kim also posted the throwback snap of the number from the runway show.

Kim's last fitting look was an incredible armored-style look that was sheer throughout, revealing a corset beneath.

The see-through number looked stunning on the star's hourglass curves.

Kim famously wore a custom creation from him for the 2019 Met Gala - he had come out retirement to design it for her, which reportedly took eight months to execute.

He also designed her post-Gala look, a Cher-inspired blue number. 

Mugler had not designed a collection of his own since 2003.

When asked by Vogue about the inspiration for the Met Gala dress, Kim had said 'he envisioned me as this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping.'
