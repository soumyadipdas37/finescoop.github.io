Manchester United are looking to sign RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano this summer, according to reports.

Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is making plans to improve several areas of his squad this week, with Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek set to join Ajax in a £40million transfer. 

And the Red Devils boss is looking to improve his centre-back options to find the perfect partner for United captain Harry Maguire.

And according to ESPN, Solskjaer is confident in securing a deal for Upamecano before the transfer deadline on October 5. 

The 21-year-old Frenchman recently signed a new contract at the Bundesliga club, who reached the Champions League semi-finals before being knocked out by Paris Saint-Germain. 

Upamecano used to have a £53million release clause in his previous contract, but the new deal has reportedly seen that figure drop to £37m - though it can only be activated after the 2020-21 season.

The French defender has played 112 times for Leipzig since arriving from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2017. 

Out of those displays, 37 came last season and Upamecano impressed as Julian Nagelsmann's side reached the last four of the competition. 

In terms of centre-back options, Manchester United currently have Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof fighting for first-team spots alongside Maguire, while Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling were loaned out during the 2019-20 season.

Meanwhile, Phil Jones only played eight times in all competitions under Solskjaer last year and the 28-year-old has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.

Manchester United are also looking to improve their attack line, with Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho high up on their transfer target list.

The 20-year-old England international was the subject of an approach by the Premier League club earlier this summer, but United missed Dortmund's August 10 deadline to finalise an agreement.

Despite this setback, the Red Devils reportedly believe they can still manufacture a deal for Sancho by the end of the transfer window in October.
