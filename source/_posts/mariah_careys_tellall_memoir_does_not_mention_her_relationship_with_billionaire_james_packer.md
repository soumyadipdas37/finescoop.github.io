Mariah Carey covers a lot of ground in her 'tell-all' memoir, from her traumatic childhood to adult relationships featuring infidelity and domestic abuse.

She writes in detail of her troubled first marriage to Tommy Mottola, the Sony boss 21 years her senior who she accuses of controlling behaviour and a 'dense and oppressive' presence. 

Carey also covers her brief affair with Yankees baseballer Derek Jeter and her second marriage to comedian Nick Cannon, the father of her two children.

What she does not even mention - anywhere - in 368 pages of The Meaning of Mariah Carey is her tumultuous 18-month relationship with Australian billionaire James Packer.

A spokeswoman for Australian publisher Pan Macmillan confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Packer did not appear anywhere in Carey's memoir. 'A search has been done and there is no mention,' she said. Packer and Carey are pictured on Valentine's Day 2016

'It took me a lifetime to have the courage and the clarity to write my memoir,' the 50-year-old says in promotional material for the book, which was released on Tuesday. 

'I want to tell the story of the moments - the ups and downs, the triumphs and traumas, the debacles and the dreams, that contributed to the person I am today.'

Those experiences apparently do not include her 10-month engagement to Packer, who has described their relationship as a 'mistake' for both of them. 

A spokeswoman for the book's Australian publisher, Pan Macmillan, confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Packer did not appear anywhere in Carey's memoir.

'A search has been done and there is no mention,' she said. 

Packer spoke candidly to author Damon Kitney about Carey for the biography The Price of Fortune: The Untold Story of Being James Packer in 2018.

The casino mogul did not read the manuscript of The Price of Fortune before its publication and he did not see The Meaning of Mariah Carey before it came out. 

Packer has not spoken to Carey in the four years since he broke off their engagement. In 2017 Packer made his first public comments on the breakdown of their relationship. 'I was at a low point in my personal life,' he said

'Haven't seen advance copy or spoken to Mariah for four years,' the 53-year-old told Nine Entertainment last week. 

The twice-divorced billionaire was introduced to the superstar singer by Hollywood producer Brett Ratner in late 2013 at Packer's Aspen, Colorado home.

They next met up in July 2014 at a Los Angeles film premiere, again with Ratner, and hit it off immediately.

'I was sitting next to Brett and [Mariah] was on the other side of him,' Packer told Kitney. 'Oliver Stone was sitting behind us and kept telling us to be quiet.'

Packer had recently split with second wife Erica and Carey had separated from Cannon, the father of her twins.

Before the relationship became public Carey and her children Monroe and Moroccan joined Packer in May 2015 on his yacht Arctic P for a Mediterranean cruise.

The couple was not photographed together until June 2015 when they were seen holding hands on the Italian island of Capri.

'It was fun to begin with… She was kind and she took an interest in my life,' Packer told Kitney. 

Carey attended Packer's 48th birthday bash in September 2015 at Ratner's Los Angeles mansion along with guests including Mick Jagger, Al Pacino, Ben Affleck and Eddie Murphy.

The couple spent Christmas that year together in Aspen and she flew to Australia to perform at a New Year's Eve concert at which she dedicated her song Hero to him.

Packer proposed on January 21, 2016 at a New York restaurant, getting down on one knee to present a 35-carat engagement ring with plans to marry in Bora Bora on March 1.

According to Packer there were 'problems' negotiating a pre-nuptial agreement which it has been reported could have benefited Carey up to $30million, or $115,385 a week.

Packer's fellow billionaire and close friend Kerry Stokes was one of his inner-circle who was concerned about the relationship, in particular her diva-like demands. 

Stokes had taken charge of Packer's private affairs in 2016 as Packer's life descended into chaos amid extreme debt and personal issues.

In that role Stokes became so concerned about Carey's extravagant lifestyle he rejected a request from her to spend $250,000 on a wedding dress. 

Stokes told Kitney he once grounded Packer's private jet to halt his plans to marry Carey, who wanted to fly from Las Vegas to Israel where her fiance was living.

Packer said they broke up on the Arctic P when it was docked in Naples after he had attended the funeral of former president Shimon Peres in Israel. The pair had enjoyed an 18-month relationship, but the break-up was toxic. The couple is pictured in New York in May 2016

Carey was outraged, according to Stokes, who said he had never intended to put a complete stop to their union and was only worried about Packer's mental health.

'I was accused of separating the lovebirds,' Stokes told Kitney.

Share prices of Packer's various businesses were plummeting and he was already deeply in debt as he negotiated splitting his late father's estate with sister Gretel. 

A combination of drinking a bottle of vodka a day and taking powerful prescription drugs did not help Packer's deteriorating mental state.

In the midst of these struggles his engagement Carey came to an abrupt end in October 2016.

Packer said they broke up on the Arctic P when it was docked in Naples after he had attended the funeral of former president Shimon Peres in Israel.

The pair had enjoyed an 18-month relationship, but the break-up was toxic. 

Carey reportedly received a $70million 'inconvenience fee' after the split - having been poised to accept $7million to walk away before allegedly upping the sum.

When Carey was questioned over Packer's whereabouts in early 2017 she said: 'I don't know where the motherf***er is'. In March 2018 she told People magazine: 'I wonder what I was thinking… The whole situation was a whirlwind. But I wish him the best'

The singer's camp apparently believed Packer had leaked details of the settlement to an Australian gossip magazine after the failed engagement.

'I had absolutely nothing to do with the story,' Packer said.

In 2017 Packer made his first public comments on the breakdown of his relationship with Carey. 'I was at a low point in my personal life,' he said.

'She was kind, exciting and fun. Mariah is a woman of substance. She is very bright. But it was a mistake for her and a mistake for me.'

When Carey was questioned over Packer's whereabouts in early 2017 she said: 'I don't know where the motherf***er is'.

In March 2018 she told People magazine: 'I wonder what I was thinking… The whole situation was a whirlwind. But I wish him the best.'

Packer had a similar message for Carey when he spoke to Nine Entertainment last week. 'I wish her well,' he said.
