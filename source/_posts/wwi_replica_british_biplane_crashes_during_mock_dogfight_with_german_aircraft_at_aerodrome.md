A pilot of Britain's first-ever military aeroplane has survived a crash following a mock dogfight between British and German World War aircrafts.

The male flyer, who has not been identified, was inside a replica of the Royal Aircraft Factory BE2c when the accident happened this morning.

It is said to have spun out of control and hurtled nose down into Sywell aerodrome in Northamptonshire.

Incredibly he was found in 'good condition' by ambulance crews who rushed to the scene and one pal said he was expected to recover.

The plane - which was featured in film ‘Biggles Sweeps the Skies” - was restored by co-owners Matthew Boddington and Steve Slater.

It was part of the The Bremont Great War Display Team and leader Gordon Brander confirmed the pilot was fine.

He told MailOnline: 'He is actually in good condition. They say that he is going to be fine.

'We have no idea what happened. We are just waiting to speak to the police and the air authorities now.

Emergency crews were seen at the site this afternoon dealing with the aftermath of the crash

The aircraft involved in the crash was a Royal Aircraft Factory BE2c which is designed for two

'The aircraft was a Royal Aircraft Factory BE2c. It is a two seater but only one person was in it at the time.'

East Midlands Ambulance Service were called to the crash at 11.39am and said they had transferred an injured patient to hospital.

Another pilot told MailOnline: 'The whole airfield has been closed down.

'There were German biplanes and triplanes bearing the Iron Cross insignia battling it out with their British rivals when the British plane crashed.

Two of the planes before they took off for the display run-through in the skies earlier today

'Some of the planes are replicas, some are originals which have been lovingly restored.'

A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said: 'We were called about it at 11.50am and are working with other emergency services at the scene including Fire, EMAS and the Air Ambulance.

'One person (the pilot) is currently being treated at the scene for their injuries.' 

A company called Air Leasing Ltd is also based at the aerodrome, which specialises in the maintenance and operation of World War II era fighters.

It is run by the mother and son team of Carolyn and Richard Grace.

An ambulance spokesperson said: 'The caller reported a light aircraft crash. We sent a paramedic in an ambulance car, a crewed ambulance and the air ambulance was also in attendance.

'We transported one patient to Coventry and Walsgrave Hospital via land ambulance.'
