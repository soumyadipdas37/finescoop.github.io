Billie, who also has sons Winston James, 11, and Eugene Pip, eight, with ex-husband Laurence Fox, was going for her favoured off-duty style in the loose-fitting jeans and warm coat as the weather gets chillier.  

Billie's outing comes after I Hate Suzie, a Sky Atlantic show, received widespread acclaim from fans since its debut.

The Swindon-born star was lauded for her brooding portrayal of former popstar  Suzie Pickles, who has her life thrown into disarray when intimate photos of her in a compromising position with a man who isn't her husband, are leaked online.

Billie co-created the eight part drama with her Secret Diary of a Call Girl writer Lucy Prebble - with viewers praising the star's performance and the gripping storyline.

As the episodes go on, the audience follows Suzie as she goes through stages of shock, denial, fear, shame, guilt, anger and eventually, acceptance. 

Suzie is seen in the programme enjoying family life with her husband and child before this is interspersed with the horror she feels when she learns the secret images of her have been made public.

As the fallout continues, Suzie and  her best friend and manager Naomi (Leila Farzad) try to hold her life, career and marriage to Cob (Daniel Ings) together.
