This is the charming moment a cow tries to keep up with several horses running through a field in Alabama. 

The footage, from March 2017, shows the calf running after several horses in Mountain View, Arkansas. 

Unsurprisingly, the cow, named Annabelle, is unable to keep up with the horses, who have not been identified. 

Several horses have been filmed running across a field in Mountain View, Arkansas 

It appears that among the horses is a donkey, who his not as quick, as the footage shows 

Though the donkey is considerably quicker than the cow which follows the group

The 25-second video features the horses running from left to right across the screen. When they are almost out of shot, the cow bounds into view and confidently chases after the horses who are far quicker. 

According to a note attached to the footage: 'My bottle calf Annabelle trying to keep up with her herd.'
