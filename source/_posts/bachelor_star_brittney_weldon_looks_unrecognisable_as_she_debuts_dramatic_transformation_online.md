She failed to find love once again on the latest season of Bachelor in Paradise.

But Brittney Weldon has shown no sign of heartache in recent months, and has even undergone a dramatic image overhaul as she continues her hunt for love.

On Sunday, the 26-year-old looked almost unrecognisable as she posed next to a gal pal on Instagram.   

Who's that girl? Brittney Weldon, 26, (left) showed off her dramatic new look on Sunday when she uploaded this photo of herself posing next to a gal pal 

Showcasing her prodigious cleavage in a plunging, bubblegum-pink playsuit, the reality star looked very different to her days in Paradise. 

Gone were her famous brunette locks, replaced with a head of freshly-bleached blonde hair that was curled gently at the ends. 

Brittney wore a heavy application of makeup, including dramatic eye shadow and a slick of pink lipstick on her decidedly plumper-looking lips.  

So different! Since her stint on the latest season of Bachelor In Paradise (left) , Brittney has bleached her hair from brunette to blonde, and debuted a much plumper-looking pout (right)

'Hey shawty,' she captioned the photo, presumably referring to her friend's petite stature. 

Her new look comes after Brittney admitted she'd love to be considered as the next Bachelorette, following unsuccessful stints on both Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelor.

She told Daily Mail Australia on Monday: 'Hello, so many choices! It would be so good! Like, just to have your pick instead of being like, pick me!

Next in line? Brittney has admitted she would 'absolutely' be open to being next year's Bachelorette

'Never say never': After stints on both Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelor, Brittney said she was still open to finding love on reality TV

'Never say never. It just depends on what it was. I wouldn't really go on Bachelor in Paradise again without the chances of meeting someone,' she explained.

Brittney won sympathy from Bachelor in Paradise fans after revealing she had an unrequited crush on Jamie Doran, but she said they now have a 'good friendship'.

'I definitely wanted more from Jamie. But that's okay. We have a really good friendship now, and that's all that I can ask for,' she admitted.

'It's better than trying it out and then hating each other, so what we have now is great. We're friends for life.'
