He wants to leave though after finding himself frozen out of their Champions League finish and spending more time on the bench. 

Villa remain discussions with Werder Bremen also over an £18m deal for attacking midfielder Milot Rashica.

Rashica, 24, is a priority for boss Dean Smith - and is likely to leave the Bundesliga club during this window, having asked for a move last month.
