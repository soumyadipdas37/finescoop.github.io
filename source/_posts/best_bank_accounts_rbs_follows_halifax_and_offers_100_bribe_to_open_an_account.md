Royal Bank of Scotland is offering £100 to customers who open a bank account

Royal Bank of Scotland is offering £100 to customers who open a bank account.

The bribe comes just weeks after the bank was voted one of the worst current account providers.  Out of 19 banks, RBS ranked 18th for overall service and bottom for its branches in the Competition and Markets Authority survey.

The cash is available to new and existing customers until November 19, but you must not have claimed a switching bonus since October 2017. 

You can choose between the bank's free Select account or its £2-a-month Reward account. 

To qualify, customers must pay in at least £1,500 each month, and log into online or mobile banking before December 30.

Halifax also offers £100 to customers who switch to its reward current account before September 14.  The account is free if you pay in £1,500 a month, or £3 a month if not.
