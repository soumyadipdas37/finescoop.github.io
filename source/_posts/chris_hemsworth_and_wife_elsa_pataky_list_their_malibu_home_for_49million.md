Chris Hemsworth and his wife of ten years Elsa Pataky have listed their Malibu home for $4.9million.

The Avengers: Endgame actor, 37, and his Fast Five star spouse, 44, purchased the secluded Point Dume house for $3.45million in early 2016.

The move comes as Hemsworth continues to develop his second sprawling Byron Bay property in the Hollywood A-lister's native Australia. 

Packing up: Chris Hemsworth and his wife of ten years Elsa Pataky have listed their Malibu home for $4.9million

The four bedroom, four bathroom Malibu house spans over 4600 square feet and sits on approximately 1.25 hillside acres.

It features a fireplace, dining terrace with built-in grill, a library, sunken courtyard garden and expansive views of the surrounding mountain ranges. 

The Australian actor and his Spanish bride previously owned an even larger home in the same area - a 6000 square foot house purchased from Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan in 2013 for $4.8million.

The couple subsequently sold the property in 2016 for $7million, well above the $6.5million asking price.

Hemsworth finished building his $20million mansion in Broken Head, near Byron Bay, Australia, last year.

And as of last month, the father-of-three had moved on to his new project: a sprawling family ranch located in the same picturesque suburb.

Aerial photos taken on Sunday show that construction is well under way on the 35-hectare estate, which Chris purchased for AU$4.25million ($3.1million) in 2019. 

Large stables surrounded by fenced-off riding tracks have been built on the land, most likely for Chris' wife, Elsa, who is an avid horse rider.

Profit: The couple subsequently sold the property in 2016 for $7million, well above the $6.5million asking price

Kitchen: The home's large kitchen also boasts impressive views of the exclusive Point Dume neighborhood

A horse riding arena complete with jumping fences has also been erected nearby.

The Hemsworths appear to be in the process of creating a garden oasis, complete with a fountain water feature, outside the stables.

On the edge of the land is a man-made lake, in which there appears to be a large floatie or trampoline.

The estate was purchased in an off-market deal last September by CHLH Management, of which Chris is listed as director.

Given that the company name also bears his brother Liam's initials, it is believed the youngest Hemsworth also has an interest in the property.

Fireplace: The home also includes a fireplace for chilly nights, as well as space for a massive flat screen television

Last July, Chris finally unveiled his AU$20million ($14.6million) Byron Bay mega-mansion after a staggering three years of construction.  

According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, who report that they've seen the floor plans, the Thor star and his wife and their three children have access to a whopping ten bathrooms.

And the family have a total of 26 surfboard racks to use, no doubt handy for keen surfer Chris.

For a touch of old-fashioned glamour comes in the form of a butler's pantry, a space traditionally used for preparing food for a large number of guests.

Decked out: Per the Zillow listing, the Malibu home's kitchen includes a dishwasher, garbage disposal and a freezer

Two bars are also well suited to entertaining the couple's large circle of friends.

The property functions as it's own retreat too, with a steam room, sauna room and massage room, as well as a gym.

There's also a 50 metre infinity pool fit for a luxury resort and a lovely outdoor pond.

A games room, TV room, living room, dining room, lounge and fire pit make for a both cosy and spacious home.

Rounding up the features are seven car spaces, five bedrooms, and a study.

Chris and Elsa tied the knot in 2010 and share daughter India Rose, eight, and sons Tristan and Sasha, six.
