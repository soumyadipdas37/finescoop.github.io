Kirsten Dunst, 38, and Jesse Plemons, 32, first met on the set of their critically acclaimed FX anthology series Fargo in 2015.

And the happily engaged pair looked like they were in domestic bliss while spotted taking a stroll through their LA neighborhood with their two-year-old son Ennis on Tuesday.

Kirsten rocked a bright red sweatshirt with Jesse's home state of Texas printed on the front of it.

She showed off her enviably slim legs in a pair of denim shorts and she kept comfy in a pair of standard black flip flops.

The Marie Antoinette star's bright blonde hair was styled into a half up, half down 'do and she had on a pair of trendy sunglasses.

Jesse looked ultra casual in a green cotton button down and a pair of marled blue sweat shorts. 

He kept his blonde hair concealed beneath a backward baseball cap and he rocked a pair of shades similar to his soon-to-be wife's.

The notoriously private couple welcomed Ennis in 2018, just two-years after going public with their romance. They got engaged in 2017. 

Jesse recently revealed to the New York Times that when he met Kirsten on the set of Fargo in 2015 he 'knew that she would be in [his] life for a long time.'

Jesse spoke to the Times as part of his promotion for his new film I'm Thinking Of Ending Things, directed by Charlie Kaufman, which premiered on Netflix on September 4.

In Fargo, which premiered on FX in 2016, Jesse and Kirsten were cast as married couple Ed and Peggy Blumquist, alongside fellow Hollywood veterans Billy Bob Thornton and Bob Odenkirk. 

As for a more recent project, the pair are set to appear in the upcoming Jane Campion film The Power Of The Dog.

While filming the project in New Zealand in March, the coronavirus struck and forced Kristen and Jesse to return home to the States.

In May, they returned to the country to continue making the movie, undergoing a 14-day quarantine with other cast and crew at a luxury hotel in Auckland.  

In The Power Of The Dog, Plemons and co-star Benedict Cumberbatch play brother who happen to own a ranch in Montana. 

When one of them gets married to Rose, played by Dunst, their relationship starts to fall apart and they find themselves at war with each other.
