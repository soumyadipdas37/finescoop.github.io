Olivier Giroud insists he does not feel threatened by Chelsea signing Timo Werner for £53million. 

The striker lit up the Bundesliga and offered a reminder of his class with a goal in Spain's 1-1 draw with Germany on Thursday night in the Nations League. 

But Giroud is relaxed about the superstar addition to Stamford Bridge despite the likelihood that Werner will slot straight into Frank Lampard's side. 

Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud insists he is not concerned by the club signing Timo Werner 

He said: 'In every big club, there's competition, and it always motivated me to fight for my spot,' he told reporters while on international duty with France.

'Now, I'm not naive and I know that the club bought Werner to put him on the pitch. One thing's for sure: we don't have the same profile, he likes to go on the sides, he did it with his club and his national team.

'If it was a striker with a similar profile, I would have been more worried, but I think with the different games and the different teams we'll play.

'The coach will choose different tactical systems and I really hope I'll play, following what I did last year.'

The German scored for his country in the Nations League 1-1 draw against Spain on Thursday

Giroud and Tammy Abraham competed for the central striking role in the team last season.

When play returned after the hiatus for coronavirus, the Frenchman scored seven times in 12 games to reestablish himself in the first team. 

And he admitted his relationship with Lampard has evolved: 'My relationship with the coach has changed, clearly,' Giroud added. 'When we were looking to find a solution for me leaving, I started to know him better. We had a few one-on-ones and I think he started to know me better as well, so it was positive.  

Giroud thinks they are different kinds of players positionally so Werner is not a threat

'We trust each other, he clearly told me I would have a chance after the lockdown. So, I gave his confidence back on the pitch.

'He knows my values and my professionalism, he said it in the press.

'I have a good relationship with him, [but] it doesn't mean he'll start me every game. I have to perform during training to be in the starting line-up.'
