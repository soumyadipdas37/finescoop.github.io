Gonzalo Higuain will become the best-paid player in the MLS once he puts pen to paper on a deal with Inter Miami, according to reports in America.

The Argentine striker agreed a £2.3million payoff with Juventus last week to terminate his contract a year early, a move which has left him free to join David Beckham's fledgling franchise.

And the Miami Herald claim the 32-year-old will outearn his new boss, with the report stating Higuain will earn a base salary of £5.45m ($7m) at Inter, where he will join former Juventus team-mate Blaise Matuidi.

That figure is a touch more than the £5m ($6.5m) base salary that Forbes claim Beckham had inserted into his LA Galazy contract during his five-year MLS stint.

Higuain has also signed a two-and-a-half year contract with Beckham's fledgling franchise to see him through to the end of the 2022 season.

The move will also see him closer to brother Federico, who has spent the last eight years in MLS and moved to DC United in March after seven-and-a-half seasons with Columbus Crew.

While the Herons are yet to officially announce the deal, co-owner Jorge Mas has posted a photo with the 32-year-old at Miami airport welcoming him to the club.

Coach Diego Alonso also confirmed the ex-Chelsea and Real Madrid forward had come for a medical and hoped to have him join up with his squad soon.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the highest-paid MLS player in 2019 but has now re-joined AC Milan after leaving LA Galaxy last year.

Figures released by the MLS Player Association suggest the Swedish striker, 38, earned a base salary of £5.6m ($7.2m) in 2019.

That put him slightly ahead of Toronto duo Michael Bradley on £4.7m ($6m base) and Jozy Altidore on £3.8m ($4.9m base). 

Inter Miami are in desperate need of a goalscorer in their debut MLS season, with all seven of their losses coming via a single-goal margin.

They currently sit bottom of the Eastern Conference after just two wins in 11 games, but they will be buoyed by a signing who scored 66 goals in 148 appearances for Juventus, winning three Serie A titles and two Coppa Italias.
