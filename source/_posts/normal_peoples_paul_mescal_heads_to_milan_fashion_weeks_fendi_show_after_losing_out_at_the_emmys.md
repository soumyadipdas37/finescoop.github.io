He sadly lost out on scooping the Best Actor gong at the Emmys on Sunday.

But Paul Mescal was still smiling as he joined a select few stars in attendance for the Milan Fashion Week Fendi show on Wednesday.

The Normal People star, 24, cut a casual figure in a black utility jacket and pinstriped trousers as he arrived to sit front row for the socially-distanced catwalk, which has been drastically scaled back in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Paul displayed his relaxed sense of style as he opted for a black utility-style jacket with contrasting pinstriped trousers and a green shirt.

The actor ensured he had a face mask to hand as he arrived for the runway show, alongside stars including singer Rita Ora.

Paul's appearance came after he lost out on winning his first ever Emmy Award,  Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie, for his performance in Normal People.

The screen star lost the coveted prize to Mark Ruffalo, who won for his work in I Know This Much Is True.  

Despite this, Paul still delighted fans by donning a Louis Vuitton suit to appear during the ceremony, live from his home.

After the ceremony, Paul's family jokingly called him a 'loser' with his musician sister, Nell, 17, taking to her Instagram Story to share a hilarious screenshot of the Mescals FaceTiming the actor.

In the snap, the star's mother was seen doing the 'loser' L-sign to her forehead while the rest of the family giggled.

Nell captioned the screenshot with: 'We still love you.'    

Paul also revealed that the first person he wanted to tell about his exciting Emmy nomination was his mother but he couldn't get in touch.

He added: 'I was trying to voice call everybody on a WhatsApp group, but nobody was picking up. 

'I think they were all kind of scared. When I got everybody on the call, it was pretty amazing. My brother who never cries was crying.'

Fendi opened Milan Fashion Week at the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in Rome, which also houses the brand’s headquarters.

Ahead of the event WWD reported CEO Serge Brunschwig said the show will be 'a physical event, with a limited number of guests and a digital component, the format of which is being defined.'

On the catwalk, red and white were the predominant colours. Models headed down the runway in a variety floaty sheer dresses, structured suits and tulle skirt.
