Laura Dundovic is known for her enviable figure and her striking facial features.

And now the former Miss Universe Australia has revealed the secret behind her glowing skin, ahead of her 33rd birthday.

In an Instagram Stories clip on Friday, the blonde beauty was seen getting a blueberry antioxidant facial peel at a Sydney clinic.

So that's her secret! Laura Dundovic (pictured) revealed how she maintains her glowing skin ahead of her 33rd birthday, in an Instagram Stories clip on Friday 

'Just in at The Clinic getting a blueberry peel for... what is it in a few days?' Laura was heard asking a beautician, to which she responded: 'Your birthday'. 

Laura looked completely relaxed as the beautician worked the treatment into her skin, followed by its removal.

The blueberry antioxidant peel, available at The Clinic, is recommended for instant, glowing skin, and is said to 'correct dull or ageing skin, mild acne or congested pores'.

'If I am exhausted and don't feel like training I don't push myself, but if I do want to push myself, I'll do a double session, but I try not to be too regimented.' 

She added: 'Go to the gym every day if you like, but if your head isn't in a good space, don't push yourself. 

'Sometimes I'll train hard for three months but then I might take three months off.' 

The model explained: 'If I am exhausted and don't feel like training I don't push myself, but if I do want to push myself, I'll do a double session, but I try not to be too regimented'
