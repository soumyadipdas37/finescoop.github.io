My 600-lb Life star Coliesa McMillian's family were reportedly allowed to visit her at a Louisiana hospital before her death last Tuesday, at age 41, from 'complications' of weight loss surgery months ago.

The TLC reality star's mother Sadie Courville told TMZ on Monday that they were unable to visit her 'for quite a while' due to COVID-19 restrictions at the Baton Rouge facility.

But once it was clear that Coliesa was on her deathbed, her two teenage daughters were able to hold her hands and say their final goodbyes.

Bid her farewell: My 600-lb Life star Coliesa McMillian's (M) family were reportedly allowed to visit her at a Louisiana hospital before her death last Tuesday, at age 41, from 'complications' of weight loss surgery months ago 

And while Courville is unclear of the exact cause of death, an East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office rep told the site McMillian 'died of natural causes.'

Audiences got to know the obese mother-of-four six months earlier when she appeared in the eighth season of the show.

At the time of filming, Coliesa weighed 643lbs and had already suffered a heart attack that was made much more severe as a result of her obesity and doctors were unable to correct the damage done to her heart because her weight made it impossible to operate.

Coliesa's family revealed that she had passed away on in a heartbreaking Facebook post that read: 'I cannot begin to express into words what our family is beginning to feel.

Sad: But once it was clear that Coliesa was on her deathbed, her two teenage daughters were able to hold her hands and say their final goodbyes 

'Tonight at 10:23 she sadly passed away from this life. We are asking that you please respect us. Thank you.'

In another comment, the unnamed family member added: 'She had health problems from her surgery and it just ended her life.'

Coliesa's family revealed in June that she had been put on life support and had 'almost died' after suffering severe complications from her weight loss surgery.

At the time, her family noted that it would be 'a very long and difficult road ahead,' however they shared their excitement at her return home after so long.

'She stayed in Houston for a few weeks,' the post read.

'Even though she has been on a long journey she has an even longer journey to go. She is a fighter. She is now confined to a bed 24/7. And is in a lot of pain. She can not do anything like she used to. But she is there.'

However in August, the family hinted that Coliesa's health had taken a turn for the worst, revealing that she was back in hospital.

Shortly after the news of her mother's death was revealed, Coliesa's daughter Hannah shared a touching tribute to her on Facebook - while also writing sweet words about Coliesa's late fiance, who died in a car crash shortly before she filmed the TLC show.

Somber: One of her daughters, Hannah, shared a tribute to her mother on Facebook

'Now y'all together,' she wrote while sharing a picture of Coliesa and her fiance together. 'These two my guardian angels. Imma miss you mom I already do!'

She had a heart attack at the age of 39 and was 'too big to do surgery on' when she was taken to the hospital.

'I know I won't survive another heart attack unless I lose weight,' Coliesa said during a clip from her show.

Participants on the reality show receive life-changing surgeries from Dr. Younan Nowzaradan, also known as Dr. Now.

In the show's eight year history with more than 100 participants featured, eight patients have died since appearing on the show, according to the program's Wikipedia.
