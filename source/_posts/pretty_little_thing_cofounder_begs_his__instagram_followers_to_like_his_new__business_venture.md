 Billionaire Adam Kamani, co-founder of Pretty Little Thing, is begging fans to like his new business venture. 

The 31-year-old entrepreneur set up Tinder-style property app MoveStreets last month.

Adam is the part of the Kamani dynasty with his father Mahmud Kamani behind the Boohoo fashion chain.

He managed to turn a Manchester market stall into a £2.6billion business.  

Following their father's success, him and his brother Umar co-founded PLT in 2012. 

Umar boasts his lavish lifestyle on Instagram by posting photos of himself at Nobu in Malibu wearing a pair of £450 Gucci slippers,hanging out with P Diddy at the Grammys or posing at the wheel of a yacht on Italy’s Amalfi Coast. 

 PrettyLittleThing employs 300 staff and counts singers Miley Cyrus, Rita Ora and Nicki Minaj among its fans.

The company's shares have plunged by £1.3 billion amid allegations that it was using sweatshops during the coronavirus pandemic and putting staff at risk. 

They were claims they were using an alleged £3.50-an-hour sweatshop in Leicester to produce cheap clothing during the coronavirus pandemic.

 It came as Leicester's coronavirus cases spiralled in June and claims that these factories were producing items for some of the UK's biggest fashion brands including Boohoo and Nasty Gal while putting staff at risk of contracting Covid-19, not providing them with masks or gloves.

  Despite that the family is reportedly worth £4billion.

 But it didn't stop Adam from begging for help after launching MoveStreets.

'Please 'click' the link I sent you and give us a 5* review on the AppStore.
