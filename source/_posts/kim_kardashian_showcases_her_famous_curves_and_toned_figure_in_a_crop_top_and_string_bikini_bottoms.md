Kim Kardashian revealed her family's long-running reality TV show was ending after 14 years and 20 seasons on Tuesday. 

And one day later after making the shocking announcement, the star enjoyed a day dipping into the ocean at a Malibu beach. 

The 39-year-old reality TV star flaunted her curves and toned figure in a long-sleeve cropped top and low-rise string bikini bottoms for her day at the beach on Wednesday.

Hitting the waves: Kim Kardashian enjoyed a day dipping into the ocean at a Malibu beach, on Wednesday, one day after she dropped the shocking announcement that Keeping Up With The Kardashians was ending next year

Kim took a dip in the water and then enjoyed a walk along the shore, with her shoulder-length black hair dripping down onto her top 

The shirt, while an unusual choice for time in the water, wrapped around her waist, accentuating her trim midriff and robust chest. 

She teamed the top with beige knit bikini bottoms that were tied with string sides pulled up above her hips and again showcasing her curves.

The mother-of-four was decked out in gold jewelry with large and thick hoop earrings on display as her hair was swept back behind her ears. 

She added a matching thick gold bracelet over one sleeve of her top and complimented the jewelry with brown tone sunglasses that she slipped on to shield her eyes as she walked. 

Kim had a lit from within glow as she closed her eyes and soaked up the sun, with her cheekbones popping in the light.

Simple glow: Her skin seemed paired down for her day out, though her lashes were done in a full voluminous style, as she had a bronze shade on her lid and an apparent think black eyeliner wing

The beach outing came one day after Kim dropped the shocking news that her series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will end in 2014 with season 20.  

The iconic reality TV series has followed the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family - including sisters Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe Kardashian, half sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, brother Rob Kardashian, and mother Kris Jenner, spawning over 12 spin-offs. 

Kim announced the news on her Instagram account on Tuesday, where she wrote in a statement: 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

Breaking the news: One day prior, Kim went on to thank everyone who has been a part of the E! reality show over the years, and credited the series with 'changing [her] life forever' 

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.'

Coming to an end: KUWTK will end next year after 14 years and 20 seasons on E!

Since finding fame on the show, each of the Kardashian-Jenner clan have gone on to forge their own careers in the fashion and business worlds, whilst each of the siblings - excluding Kendall - now have families of their own.

It has also been said that Khloe 'hasn't stopped crying' over the end of the show.

Kris said: 'We had to tell the crew yesterday, so we were all crying. But I think Khloe...is probably the one who is taking it the hardest and really hasn't stopped crying since we announced. She's been so sweet and just emotional about it.'

Kris admitted it has been a 'hard' decision to make, but she felt it was the 'right time' to end the show.
