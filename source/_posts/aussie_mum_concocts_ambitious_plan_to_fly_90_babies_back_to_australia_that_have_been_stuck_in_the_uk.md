A mum has devised an ambitious plan to fly 90 babies back to Australia from the UK to meet their extended family for the first time.

Carly McCrossin launched the 'fly the babies home' campaign on August 5 after three tough months in UK's lockdown watching her daughter grow while her family in Australia and her husband's in New Zealand missed major milestones. 

She hopes to organise a charter flight for her to take 'lockdown' baby Ailish, born in April amid the coronavirus pandemic, and others families with young ones home for Christmas. 

'The heartbreak of not being able to introduce your newborn baby to your families is something unimaginable that I still, even after a few months, I can’t quite seem to quite get my head around,' she said in a video posted to Facebook.

'And every day I’m packing up her clothes that she won’t fit into anymore, knowing that they’ll never see her that small.

'Every day a little piece of my heart just kind of breaks off because you’re being robbed of so many just incredible memories of her that you want to share with your family and you can’t.

The mother came up with the idea after 'sitting around, getting sadder and sadder' about the situation, then decided to make a video to reach out to any people in London that have a lockdown baby and have family in Australia or New Zealand.

More than 19,000 citizens and permanent residents stuck overseas are battling cancelled flights as limitations on international arrivals drive up competition. 

Airlines are routinely selling their high-priced seats to remain profitable, reducing the availability of economy tickets.  

Families that are interested in making the journey will then be asked register into the campaign online then self-shield and isolate for two to three weeks prior to boarding the flight.   

'I’m reaching out to commercial airlines to say ‘if you have any jets, or I don’t know how it works, if you’ve got any planes that you’d be willing to dedicate like an airline number to us or a flight to us so we could get home for Christmas, I would be just so appreciative,' she said.  

Once transport has been secured, she will reach out to the governments to ask whether the group can self-isolate in their family homes upon arrival if they have quarantined prior.

By August 11, the mother had received 67 registrations, which grew by 95 the following week.   

On Tuesday, Ms McCrossin told news.com.au , she now has a total of 98 families, which includes 196 adults, 91 babies and 37 toddlers.

Ms McCrossin said they will be coronavirus safe flights, but the journey will not be free.

 'Everyone on the flight will be required to pay the normal return UK to AU/NZ airfare depending on the class of travel chosen or offered,' the online registration page reads.

'We may need to pro-rata the ticket price depending on how we socially distance the passengers across the range of classes.

'Depending on the number of passengers and destination we may not be able to fly into your preferred destination choice … but we will definitely get you as far as we can!' 

An Instagram page dedicated to the cause has amassed 181 followers. 

Ms McCrossin told fans on August 22 she was 'looking forward to the reply emails next week of flight options'.
