This is the moment a Spanish rescue team saves two female hikers a dog after the animal fell seven feet and got trapped on a tiny ledge.  

The rescue took place in the area of Puig de Galatzo in the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range located in the tourist island of Majorca, Balearic Islands. 

One of the hikers held onto a tree to save her from falling further down the mountain after trying to reach the dog.

A Spanish rescue team saved two female hikers a dog after the animal fell seven feet and got trapped on a tiny ledge (pictured) 

The West Highland White Terrier had tumbled down two metres (6.6 feet).

Mountain Rescue and Civil Guard officials were sent to the scene and first rescued the dog, trapped on a small rocky ledge.

Rescue teams then helped the woman get to safe ground.

The other female hiker, who had also attempted to climb the mountain with her pooch, was stuck as well.

One of the hikers held onto a tree to save her from falling further down the mountain after trying to reach the dog 

But her position was not as dangerous as the others so she was helped by rescuers last.

The group was helped to a higher spot on the mountain where the rescue helicopter could land and take them to the Son Espases Hospital in Majorca.

They were reportedly exhausted and stressed from the ordeal.

So far this year, the Mountain Rescue and Intervention Group have taken part in 47 rescue operations in the Balearic Islands.
