She rose to prominence as one of the nation's leading lingerie stars in the Nineties.

And Sophie Anderton proved she's still got it as she uploaded images of herself sunbathing during her scenic trip to the South of France on Instagram on Wednesday.

The model, 43, showcased her incredible figure in an orange swimsuit by Hunza G as she soaked up the stunning scenery.

What a babe! Sophie Anderton proved she's still got it as she uploaded images of herself sunbathing during her scenic trip to the South of France on Instagram on Wednesday

Highlighting her toned frame, the vibrant one-piece featured a low-scoop neckline and daringly cut sides.

The Gossard icon swept her tresses into a sleek bun while shielding her eyes from the sun in square-framed shades. 

The Bristol native captioned her images: 'My happy place! It was so [hot] the afternoon when this was taken whilst I kicked back and regenerated my energy levels from a hectic work schedule.

'Poolside at my clients beautiful villa ..Loving the new @hunza.g collection! #obsessed #hunzag #orange #poolside #model #modellife #summervibes #summer #southoffrance #swimsuit #bodypositive #myhappyplace.' (sic)

Sophie currently lives in Wicklow with her boyfriend, Polish jazz musician Count Kaz Balinski-Jundzill.

The Celebrity Big Brother star has been practising yoga to keep fit and sane in lockdown — and suggests others do the same.

Sophie prioritises her health and wellness following her highly publicised battle with drink and drugs.

The Love Island star once admitted she was 'lucky to survive' her own addiction problems, on which she apparently 'blew £10 million over 13 years', and confided to friends that she was self-harming and had considered ‘ending it all’.

Yet speaking to The Daily Mail in 2015, the media personality dismissed all this as 'light years from where I am now.'

She explained: 'I was very unhappy [in my 20s]. I had no control over who I was or how I looked.

'I was a model but at some point modelling became only one part of what was required of us, and suddenly to be successful we had to be celebrities. 

'It’s not something that came naturally. I was terrible at being famous.'
