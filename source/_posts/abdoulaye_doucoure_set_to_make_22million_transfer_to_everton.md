Abdoulaye Doucoure has completed his Everton medical ahead of a proposed £22million transfer from Watford. 

He will sign a four year contract and an official announcement is expected in the next 24 hours. 

The experienced Frenchman has made 129 appearances for Watford, scoring 17 goals and providing 12 assists.

Everton have agreed to sign Abdoulaye Doucoure from Watford for a fee of £22million

He has completed his medical, and is set to make the switch following Watford's relegation

However, he was eager to leave the Hornets after they were relegated from the Premier League at the end of last season. 

Prior to joining Watford, the midfielder played for Stade Rennais in Ligue 1, and Granada in La Liga. 

The 27-year-old travelled to Merseyside on Thursday for his medical and should become an official Everton player by the end of Friday. 

Carlo Ancelotti is overseeing a significant rebuild at Everton as the club improve their midfield

Colombia midfielder James Rodriguez is expected to arrive from Real Madrid for over £20m

Doucoure's ability to drive forward from midfield is a useful asset and the arrival of James Rodriguez will also bolster Everton's creativity.

Carlo Ancelotti is overseeing a major rebuild of the midfield, with Rodriguez and Allan also close to joining. 

Rodriguez is set to join from Real Madrid for over £20m, while Allan is on the verge of signing from Napoli for £21m, meaning Everton will have spent over £60m on improving their midfield. 

Earlier in the transfer window Everton secured a deal for left-back Niels Nkounkou, who was previously at Marseille.
