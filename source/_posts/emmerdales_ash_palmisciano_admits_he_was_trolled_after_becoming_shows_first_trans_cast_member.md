Ash Palmisciano has revealed he was on the receiving end of trolling after he became Emmerdale's first trans cast member.

The actor, 30, who plays trans character Matty Barton on the soap, told how he was 'overwhelmed' with some of the positive reaction he got.

Speaking on Monday's episode of Lorraine, he said: 'If you put yourself out there you’ll always attract a troll online.

'The letters I’ve received and the comments from people have been overwhelming. That’s why I wanted to play this character.'

Ash, who joined Emmerdale almost two years ago, hopes that his performance shows viewers that Matty is 'just a regular guy'.

He said: 'It sparks conversation. That’s what soaps are really good about. It makes it seem usual and not something to be scared of. There is that storyline with Matty, but he is just a regular guy.'

On the soap, Matty has developed feelings for Amy Wyatt (Natalie Ann Jamieson) with Ash describing their burgeoning relationship as a 'complicated web'.

He said: 'Matty is really smitten with her and really thinking it’s going to go somewhere and like all good soaps, there’s lots of complications.

'He’s been through a lot, it’s been a crazy couple of years for him. They’re close and they really connect. It’s a really sweet relationship.' 

Having recently returned to filming following the coronavirus lockdown, Ash admitted he feels 'lucky' as an actor to have a steady job when so many don't. 

He said: 'I feel really lucky I had a job to go back to. A lot of actors are out of work right now. It was great, it was getting to the point where I had to get out of the house. I’m just so happy to be back.'

The TV star told Lorraine that when he first joined Emmerdale, his storyline was only supposed to last for a few months before bosses decided to keep him on. 

He said: 'When I started it was a three month contract and to still be there 2 years later is amazing. 

'I was doing any job I could, I was an elf at Christmas. When I got this job, I was so grateful.'
