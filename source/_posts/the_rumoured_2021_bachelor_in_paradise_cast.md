This year's season of Bachelor In Paradise certainly brought the drama, with fans calling out tattooed Brit Ciarran Stott for his 'womanising' ways.

And according to a reality TV podcast this week, Channel Ten producers are already looking to cast the 2021 season.

It's believed a number of rejects from Locky Gilbert's season of The Bachelor have shown an interest, despite the finale episode having not aired yet.

The current season's rejects who have reportedly expressed interest are Zoe-Clare McDonald, Charley Bond, Juliette Herrera, Laura Calleri, Leilani Vakaahi, Maddy Carver, Marg Zogoulas, Bel Colwell, Rosemary Sawtell and Roxi Kenny. 

It's also understood former Bachelor In Paradise stars that may be set for a return include Paddy Colliar, Jackson Garlick and Renee Barrett.

Most surprising however is reports that past Bachelor and Bachelorette winners Chelsie McLeod and Carlin Sterritt are set to join, with Chelsie having allegedly already signed the contract.

Any truth? It's been reported that Zoe-Clare McDonald (left) and Roxi Kenny (right) from Locky's season have expressed an interest 

Rumour mill: Rosemary Sawtell (pictured) is also said to be keen 

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Ten for comment. 

The reports come after Carlin revealed he was originally in the running to be The Bachelor, before signing onto last year's season of The Bachelorette. 

This month on Big Brother star Sophie Budack's YouTube channel, the 31-year-old explained how his employer put his name forward to producers.

Back for more? Ciarran's ex-girlfriend Renee Barrett (pictured), who also starred on this year's season of Bachelor In Paradise, may be set for a return 

Signed on the dotted line? Most surprising however is reports that past Bachelor and Bachelorette winners Chelsie McLeod (pictured) and Carlin Sterritt are set to join, with Chelsie having allegedly already signed the contract 

'He did it behind my back. I didn't ask him to do it,' Carlin said. 

'I got an audition for The Bachelor and from that process - and I didn't get The Bachelor - but I met with a lot of the casting directors and producers. They sort of got to know who I was,' the influencer and fitness trainer continued. 

'So when The Bachelorette came to be, they pretty much gave me a call and said "Hey, did you want to just apply for this?" and I said, "Sure!'" 

Shock revelation: Carlin (pictured) revealed on Big Brother star Sophie Budack's YouTube channel this month that he was originally in the running to be The Bachelor, before signing onto last year's season of The Bachelorette 

Over: Carlin won the season and Angie Kent's heart, but the couple (pictured) went their separate ways this year
