He's making his mark on the music world.

And Vin Diesel stepped away from his usual scene of muscle cars and mayhem with the release of his debut single, Feel Like I Do, on Friday. 

The 53-year-old action star hoped to make his fans 'proud' as he sings a ballad to a familiar person he just met at a bar in the three-minute bop.

'For so long, I have been promising to release music... encouraged by you, to step out of my comfort zone,' he wrote on Instagram. 'Thank you for believing in me. As always, I hope to make you proud.'

Diesel — who's real name is Mark Sinclair — admitted he buckled down in the studio amid the global pandemic.

'Find your creativity, step out of your comfort zone. One never knows what treasures you may find... within,' he captioned another snap.

'I just heard a master of a song that's coming out that I was able to do during these unprecedented COVID times,' he told his 65million followers last month. 'I am so excited for you all to hear it.

'Shout out to all of you who encouraged me to continue my passion for singing. Boy did that outlet come in handy during these past six months.'

Diesel's foray into the music world follows his beginnings as a break dancer in New York. 

His voice has been used for a Kygo song with Selena Gomez, It Ain't Me, and he also rapped on stage with Nicky Jam during the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2017.
