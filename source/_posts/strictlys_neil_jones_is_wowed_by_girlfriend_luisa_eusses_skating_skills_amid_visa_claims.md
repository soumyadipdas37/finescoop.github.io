It was recently claimed that his new girlfriend Luisa Eusse has been reported to the Home Office by her ex, for allegedly staying in the UK on an expired visa.

But Neil Jones and his new partner shared footage of themselves putting the drama behind them on Saturday, when they visited a Manchester skateboard park together.

The Strictly Come Dancing star, 38, took to his Instagram account to share footage of himself arriving at the city's Projekts MCR Skatepark, while his 23-year-old Colombian partner did the same.

'I fell in love with this skatepark,' dancer Luisa captioned footage of herself showing off her skills in the urban space, which she described as 'paradise'.

The tattooed beauty looked casually cool for the outing, donning a white sports bra with camouflage combat trousers and a pair of box fresh white basketball shoes.

Their outing comes after it was claimed that Luisa is thought to have come to the UK on a 'fiancée visa' when she was dating DJ Hannah Wants, 34, whose real name is Hannah Smith.

However, the former couple split in July - weeks before Neil and Luisa announced their romance - and the visa is said to have expired in August, reports The Sun.

A source said: 'Hannah is angry, and a bit bemused that Luisa is in such a high-profile relationship so soon after they split.'

The source claimed Hannah and Luisa had been looking at register offices for their wedding, leaving the DJ with the impression that the dancer would extend her visa. 

However, after their split the source said that Hannah, who was allegedly financially supporting Luisa, 'did the responsible thing' and spoke to the Home Office.

The added: 'Hannah did the responsible thing and spoke to the Home Office. She thought Luisa would have to leave and apply for a new visa.' 

It is now understood that Luisa is staying in the UK on a student visa, however it is not known what course she is taking or if she left the country before applying. 

MailOnline has contacted representatives of Neil Jones and DJ Hannah Wants for a comment. Neil's spokesperson told The Sun that Luisa is 'studying here'. 

The 'fiancée visa' is valid for six months and applicants have to prove they are planning to marry or become civil partners within six months of arriving in the UK.

Other conditions include being able to prove that the applicant and their partner have a combined income of at least £18,600, reports Gov.uk.  

It can be extended only if the person can prove they are set to marry their partner within the next six months. 

The allegations comes after Luisa and Neil, who announced their relationship in August, sparked speculation that they may have gotten married when she called him 'my husband' in an Instagram post.

Sharing stunning snaps of the pair together in a saucy woodland shoot, Neil penned: 'Do you believe in fate?' adding the Spanish translation, 'Crees en el destino?'

Luisa was quick to comment: 'With you, I believe in everything, in love at first sight, in luck, in destiny, but above all I believe in your sweet and pure love.' 

Also sharing the images, Luisa penned a passionate post in Spanish in which she claimed Cupid had brought them together and referred to Neil as her 'husband'.

The steamy snaps did little to quell rumours that the couple have secretly tied the knot.

Just last month, Luisa shocked when she revealed she had taken his surname Jones and doubled down by calling him her 'husband' in her post.    

Things have been moving very fast for the couple, as last month, Luisa took to her Instagram stories to share a boomerang of her zooming into her post, which showed her mail was being sent to 'Luisa Jones'. 

In another Instagram post on Sunday, she donned a bridal white outfit consisting of a blazer, trousers and bralet as she penned 'Jones' with a heart emoji, seemingly referring to her new surname.

The rumours come after Neil's ex-wife Katya gave the seal of approval to his new relationship by liking a loved-up Instagram picture of the pair.

Professional dancer Neil shared a steamy black and white snap kissing and cuddling dancer Luisa captioned with a love heart.

And Katya, 31, who is also a star on Strictly Come Dancing, wasted no time liking the sweet post, showing that she's happy he has moved on.

The couple's six-year marriage ended in 2018, months after pictures emerged of Katya kissing her dance partner Seann Walsh, 34, on a night out.
