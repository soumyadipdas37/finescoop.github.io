Judges dramatically reduced bail amounts as high as $1 million Thursday that had been set this week for several people accused of crimes during unrest in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, that included protests and vandalism to public buildings.

Bail for nine of 13 defendants was lowered, in several cases so they will not have to put up any money to be released, LNP reported.

Bail for two defendants was reduced from $1 million to $50,000 unsecured, clearing the way for their release pending trial.

Three other defendants received a $50,000 unsecured bail, allowing them to leave jail without putting up cash, but they are required to remain on house arrest until trial.

In other cases, defendants will still need to post bail of $25,000-$100,000, which means they may have to come up with a portion of it in cash to pay the bail bondsman.

District Court Judge Bruce Roth, who initially set the $1 million bonds, reviewed some of the bail petitions, and others were heard by Judge Dennis Reinaker.

During bail review, the court heard arguments from defense attorneys and prosecutors over each defendant's level of culpability, as well as their family circumstances and ties to the community. 

The charges stem from unrest over the shooting by police of Ricardo Munoz, a Lancaster man who charged cops while wielding a knife after his sister sought to have him committed for mental health treatment.

Police body camera video that was made public shows the 27-year-old Munoz brandishing the knife before the officer shot and killed him. 

Munoz had been awaiting trial on allegations he stabbed four people last year.

The charging documents filed by police over the demonstrators' actions described them all as instigators, which defendants' family members and supporters have in some cases hotly denied.

The protests Sunday night and early Monday were followed by rioting that caused damage to Lancaster's police headquarters and other downtown buildings. An arson fire blocked a downtown intersection.

Munoz had been out on bond, awaiting trial for allegations he stabbed four people last year, including a teenage boy who was stabbed in the face.

His sister said Munoz was mentally ill - diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia - and hadn't been taking his medications. 

She said she had called a crisis intervention organization and a police non-emergency number to get her brother involuntarily committed.

'He had an episode. He was just incoherent and acting out,' she said. 'I called to find out what the procedure was to get him some help.'  

Protesters gathered outside the police station in the wake of the shooting and, in video posted to social media, they chanted: "Hands up, don´t shoot," "No justice, no peace" and "What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!"

It was unclear how motivated protesters were by racism as they have been in other cities where deaths at the hands of police have stoked protest. 

Court papers list Munoz's race as white.
