Loose Women viewers were left crying with laughter after Eammon Holmes gave Ruth Langsford a disastrous makeover on today's show.

Presenters Eammon and Ruth, both 60, who have been married since 2010, left viewers in hysterics during a special 'Loose Loved Ones' episode of the chat show alongside Peter Andre and his wife Emily MacDonagh. 

After a poll revealed that only nine per cent of women would let their partners do them up, both Ruth and Emily, 31, decided to let their husbands give them a makeover live on the show.

Eammon was off to a bold start, applying bright purple lipstick to his wife's face, before promptly snapping it half by mistake.

Peter, 47, opted for a more natural look for Emily, but was slightly confused about some of the products, trying to apply blush to his wife's chin. 

After telling viewers that he would try and make the most of his wife's lips, Eammon proceeded to add more red lipstick to the already purple lips.

However after being jogged by Ruth talking, Eammon decided to give his wife an overwhelmingly red lip, leaving viewers delighted.  





Fans quickly took to Twitter to laugh at the hilarious make-over, with one writing: 'What is Eammon doing to poor Ruth'

'Well done Ruth letting Eamon do your make up live on TV, well funny', said another. 

A third agreed: 'Absolutely hilarious, I was crying with laughter watching you.'   

The episode saw both couples open up about their relationships, with Emily revealing revealed that she was rather underwhelmed by Peter's attempts to impress her during the early days of their romance.

The couple were quizzed about the early stages of their courtship, with Emily recalling that her now-husband made a big faux pas. 

Emily told Eamonn and Ruth that one snowy night, Peter had decided to visit her university halls, and rocked up to her halls in his a Lamborghini. 

'That doesn't really float my boat, said Emily, 'So I think he misjudged it slightly. Because I couldn't care less about cars or anything.  But he didn't do it again, that's for sure!'





Viewers were delighted by the makeover, and loved having Emily and Peter on the show, with one calling for the couple to be a permanent fixture on Loose Women

While Peter replied: 'It was just foolish and I don't know, I think in my thirties, I think I was having a mid-life crisis. I really do. In my forties, I just wouldn't do that now.'

Viewers loved having the pair on the show, with one calling for the couple to be a permanent fixture on Loose Women.  

'What an ace show today with Eammon and Emily,' wrote one. 'Made my day.'

Another said: 'Please can we have a permanent show with Eammon, Ruth, Peter and Emily. What a hilarious show and couples.'
