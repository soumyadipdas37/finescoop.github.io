A Victorian man was disgusted after finding a slug inside a half-cauliflower he purchased from his local Woolworths supermarket. 

Michael Robinson bought the cauliflower from the Lara Woolworths, northeast of Geelong, on Wednesday before making the find at home.

Mr Robinson took to the Woolworths Facebook page to express his disgust.

'Not happy Woolworths, the not so fresh people, had this slug and all its pooh through my cauliflower,' he wrote.

'Looks like I will be now shopping at your opposition. One very unhappy long time Woolies customer.'

A Woolworths spokesperson responded to Mr Robinson's post saying the company understood his disappointment. 

'We're sorry to see your cauliflower in that condition and we definitely share your disappointment in this matter,' the reply read.

'With our Fresh or Free guarantee, you're eligible for a full refund or replacement.

'We hope that your next experience with us is a positive one.'
