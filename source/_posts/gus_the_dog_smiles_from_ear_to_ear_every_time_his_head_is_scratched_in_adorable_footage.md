An adorable video of a dog thoroughly enjoying a head scratch from his owner has been viewed thousands of times online by adoring fans.

Gus, a one-year-old golden retriever from Orlando, Florida, grins from ear to ear when he gets his head scratched by owner Shelby Harrison.

Shelby shared the cute video of Gus grinning to Instagram on June 25 and it has already received more than 10,000 views

The video shows Gus grinning from ear to ear as Shelby uses an extendable back scratcher from Amazon to gently massage his head. 

The handheld device has a claw shaped 'hand' which Shelby uses to scratch the top of Gus' head.

Hilariously, as soon as his Shelby stops, Gus returns to a rather blank expression. 

But he resumes his broad smile as soon as she starts scratching his head again.    

Gus is already a popular online personality with a following of over 12,500 on his Instagram account.

Apart from head scratches, the adorable pup also enjoys dock diving, swimming and a good game of fetch.

He is always keen to eat lots of snacks and is very fond of a good head scrub, too.  

Gus' owner Shelby said: 'I have had Gus since he was 8 weeks old.

'It's been so surreal watching this video go viral and seeing all the comments and shares. 

'I absolutely love seeing how a short 25-second clip that I filmed on a whim, has brought so much joy to so many people.'
