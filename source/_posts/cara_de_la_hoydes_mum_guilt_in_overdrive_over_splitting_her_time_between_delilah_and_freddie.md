Cara has been very open with her fans throughout her motherhood journey and this week opened the floor up to questions on how she's coping as a mother of two.

The star, who last month admitted that she had had a 'really tough week' juggling Freddie's behavior and Delilah's colic, told how she has felt guilty for spending lot of time with her daughter. 

After a fan asked if she felt guilty for her first child after having a second, Cara replied: 'Mum guilt has been in overdrive the last few weeks.

'Especially because I'm exclusively breastfeeding and with the colic on top Delilah is taking up so much of my time.

'I'm trying to do as much with him as I can when she sleeps & I try to bath and put him to bed every night.'

With a new baby in the household, the reality beauty explained how little Freddie had been 'acting out' of late and had even been 'swearing' as he sought more attention from his parents.

Responding to a question of how Freddie was coping having to 'share' her, Cara said: 'Not well at all, it's been really hard, he been acting out, swearing and in general doing anything to get out attention (which has mostly been him being naughty)

The TV star also went on to discuss her baby girl's colic in more detail, and admitted that at times she hasn't coped 'very well' and had been in a lot of tears.

Responding to a fan who asked how she's coped with it, Cara said honestly: 'Not gonna lie, sometimes not very well, had lots of tears and had to walk away alot when it's too much.

'We've tried infacol, I've changed my diet, I'm also looking into taking her to an osteopath & lots of passing her between us and taking turns. But my goodness it really is awful.'

With so much to juggle at the moment, Cara admitted that she's not quite ready to add to her brood straight away. 

When asked if she and Nathan, 28, would consider more children, she responded: 'Maybe when they are both at school age but maybe not anytime soon.

'If I'm honest having a colic baby has really put me off going again right now.'

Delilah had been suffering with colic, which Cara explained 'has got a lot better' thanks to cutting out certain food in her own diet including anything spicy and fizzy drinks.

She also revealed she was hoping to start expressing some of her milk this week to 'see if that takes a bit of pressure off of me,' and so other family members can feed her newborn.

And while she said she was happy with Delilah's progress, Cara admitted it's been a struggle juggling toddler Freddie with her baby.

'It's really stressful. He doesn't listen to anything I say. If I tell him off, he tells me off or scratches and pinches me. But then I don't really want to tell him off. He's not really a massive joy to be around at the moment,' she said.

'I don't want him to feel pushed out,' she admitted. 'I've sorted out the colic, and now it's one thing after another, this week has been very tiring.'

She ended her honest video by saying: 'Two kids, a whole new ballgame... Hopefully I don't end up murdering my child, or my husband, or maybe myself!'

A baby with colic cries a lot as well as clenching their fists, going bed in the face and arching their back.  

Health visitors and doctors will usually advise to:

Other remedies mothers hear about are anti-colic drops, herbal and probiotic supplements, changes to their diet if they're breastfeeding or applying gentle pressure to your baby's spine (spinal manipulation) or skull (cranial osteopathy).

But the NHS says there is little evidence for these so far.
