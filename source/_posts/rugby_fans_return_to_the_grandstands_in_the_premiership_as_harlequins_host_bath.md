Fans have returned to the grandstands for Rugby Premiership action under the government's regulations for coronavirus test events. 

Around 2,700 members of the public were allowed to buy tickets for this afternoon's match between Harlequins and Bath.

And with sundry sponsors, squad members, media, caterers and stewards, it takes the capacity up to 3,500.

Fans have been given set times to leave and arrive and seperated around the Stoop

Strict measures over social distancing are in place with spectactors given set times to leave and arrive from the Stoop, and have been spread around all four sides of the ground.

British rugby union's first pilot event was Edinburgh playing Glasgow in front of 700 spectators at Murrayfield last weekend.   

It is expected tests under the overall aegis of the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport will continue in varying parts of the country.

As reported by Inews Harlequins chief executive Laurie Dalrymple said: 'My gut feel is if these pilot schemes go positively over September and October, we may get spectators on a wider scale back quicker than we think.' 

'But, for prudence's sake, we are expecting to be in this situation into 2021.' 

Up to 20,000 supporters are set to be allowed into Twickenham to watch England take on the Barbarians on October 25. 

The game takes place a week before Eddie Jones's side face Italy in their rearranged Six Nations finale and fans will be able to attend, pending government approval. 

The RFU have outlined a number of safety measures that will be put in place with less than 25 per cent of the stadium's total 82,000 capacity in use on the day.
