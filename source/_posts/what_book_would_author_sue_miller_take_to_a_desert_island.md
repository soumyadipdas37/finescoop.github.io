. . . are you reading now?

Galore, a novel by Canadian author Michael Crummey. 

He's boundlessly inventive in his creation of wholly distinctive worlds for his characters — in this case, the remoter parts of the island of Newfoundland, among characters whose lives are dominated by the folkloric tales they live within and pass along. 

Among other things, it's very funny.

. . . would you take to a desert island?

It would have to be a book I'd read before — imagine launching yourself into the one that had to last you for perhaps the rest of your life then discovering you hated it. 

I'd also need multiple plotlines and rich worlds to explore. War And Peace? Why not?

. . . first gave you the reading bug?

Jane Eyre when I was 12. I took it down from my parents' bookshelf at random. From the first sentence, I was lost in it. 

Charlotte Brontë has much to answer for by proposing the outwardly cruel, inwardly sensitive and passionate model of what a man should be.

But Jane's slow making of a self out of the most unlikely materials is wonderful.

. . . left you cold?

Wuthering Heights. Emily Brontë is considered by some to be a truer poet than Charlotte; but somehow the book seems nearly parodic in its intensity. 

Like a grotesque version of her sister's work. Unfair, no doubt.

Monogamy by Sue Miller is out now (Bloomsbury, £16.99).
