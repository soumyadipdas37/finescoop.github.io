'Travis is a true McDonald's fan having grown up visiting our restaurants in Houston, not to mention one of the biggest musical acts and cultural icons in the world. This is the first time in nearly 30 years we've introduced a superstar's name to our menu,' said McDonald's US chief marketing officer, Morgan Flatley, last week in a news release.

The Sicko Mode rapper also said he was looking forward t the collaboration.

'I couldn't be more excited to bring the Cactus Jack x McDonald's collaboration to life,' Travis said in a statement. 'We are bringing together two iconic worlds. Including a charitable component was key for me, and I can't wait for people to see what we have in store'.

Travis and McDonald's will be exploring opportunities to support charitable organizations during the month-long program.

The singer's fashion arm Cactus Jack also has designed custom apparel for McDonald's crew.
