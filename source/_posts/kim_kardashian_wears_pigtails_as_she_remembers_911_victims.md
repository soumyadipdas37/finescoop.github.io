Kim Kardashian shared another pinup photo to Instagram on Friday.

The reality TV star - who turns 40-years-old next month - looked like a teenager as she wore 'rave' pigtails, a leotard and a pair of skintight jeans that showed off her bottom as she was propped up on a counter flashing her purple boots.

Page Six claimed that was a big factor and she did not want to air is unraveling on the series.

But it seems the problems will have to be addressed somehow as the show will air all the way until 2021. 

The iconic reality TV series has followed the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family - including sisters Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe Kardashian, half sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, brother Rob Kardashian, and mother Kris Jenner - for 20 seasons aired over the past 14 years.

DONE: This comes after the shocking news that her series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will end in 2014 with season 20

Kim announced the news on her Instagram account, where she wrote in a statement: 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.'

Kim went on to thank everyone who has been a part of the E! reality show over the years, and credited the series with 'changing [her] life forever'.

She added: 'Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience and, most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.

'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years. This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever.' 

Since finding fame on the show, each of the Kardashian-Jenner clan have gone on to forge their own careers in the fashion and business worlds, whilst each of the siblings - excluding Kendall - now have families of their own.

It has also been said that Khloe 'hasn't stopped crying' over the end of the show.

Kris said: 'We had to tell the crew yesterday, so we were all crying. But I think Khloe...is probably the one who is taking it the hardest and really hasn't stopped crying since we announced. She's been so sweet and just emotional about it.'

Kris admitted it has been a 'hard' decision to make, but she felt it was the 'right time' to end the show.

Speaking to creator and executive producer Ryan Seacrest on his radio show, she said: 'I think the number 20, well it used to sound good until 2020, but the number 20, it just seemed like the right time.

'I think for us to take a minute and breathe and everybody slow down a bit. Not slow down professionally, but just you know figure out what our next steps are.

'We've had such an amazing run and so grateful for every single moment and everyone we work with.'

But the 64-year-old momager admitted she and her family are still processing the change. Asked if it has sunk in yet, she admitted it 'really hasn't'.

She added: 'It's funny, when we talked yesterday, I kinda had my wits about me and I thought I was really strong. And, you know, this is the right decision.

'Today I wake up and I was thinking about the first time you and I ever did an interview on the air, and I was so excited and so nervous.

'I woke up and was in the gym at 5 o'clock with Khloé and Kim and we just kind of sat there and looked at each other and said, 'Whoa, what a ride.' It was quite the morning.'
