Jess Eva and Norm Hogan have spent their entire $209,000 prize they earned on The Block two years ago.

Speaking on Triple M's Moonman In The Morning on Friday, Jess revealed the couple spent the amount to purchase swimming pools, gamble and help out their friends.

'The first thing we bought was two above-ground pools and we handed them out to our friends like lollies,' she revealed.

'We just had friends who had been wanting a pool for ages... They're $5000 each, so there's $10,000,' she said.

Jess also revealed the couple spent a portion of the prize money, betting on a tennis match.

'Remember when Ash Barty was starting out on the tennis circuit and we didn't know she was going to be a winner and she was playing against Maria Sharapova?' she told her co-hosts Lawrence Mooney and Chris Page.

'We put thousands on Maria Sharapova and it was just when Ash Barty was starting her winning streak… I'll never forget Norm's look after Maria lost the second set, he just had tears in his eyes,' she said.

Jess also told News.com.au, she and Norm paid off a friend's car loan, bought two lawnmowers and purchased block of land on an island.

Jess and Norm became household names after starring in the 2018 season of The Block, and share son Fred, five, and daughter Matilda, two.

During the show's finale, the couple sold their apartment at auction for $2,859,000, making a tidy profit of $209,000.

In July, the former Block stars sold their block of land in Queensland's Russell Island, after seven days of listing it.

The reality television stars purchased the land in July 2019 for $17,000 and sold it for $24,000 within one week of its listing.
