The Only Way is Essex star Amy Childs has criticised Mark Wright for snubbing the 10-year reunion and tells how the cast should remember 'where we have come from'.

The TV star, 30, explained how without the hit ITV show Mark, 33, and the rest of the TOWIE line-up 'would not be where they are now'. 

Amy, who joined as part of the original first series in 2010 aged 20, said that the cast 'owe' their success to TOWIE and told how 'the least we can do is celebrate that'.

Speaking to The Sun, Amy, who starred as a qualified beauty therapist on the show, said: 'Mark is a friend of mine but I think we have to remember where we have come from. 

'The show has achieved so much. It has given us all amazing opportunities and lives.' 

She added: 'It is a shame Mark has chosen not to celebrate and be a part of that. It is the least we can do.'

The mother-of-two described how 'everyone loved Mark', who is married to actress Michelle Keegan, 33, and said she was 'shocked' he did not return given his status as the 'King of Essex'. 

Amy, who announced she is returning for the next series of TOWIE which is set to air next Sunday on ITVBe, described how returning to the reality show 'feels like home'. 

It comes after Mark took part in annual charity game Soccer Aid as he played with the England team against the Rest of the World at Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday.

It comes after Lauren Goodger appeared to have buried the hatchet with her ex Mark as she shared throwback snaps of the pair while marking 10 years in the spotlight ahead of the TOWIE reunion. 

The reality star, 33, took to Instagram to thank the famous show for providing her with meaningful 'memories' and insisted she's 'proud' of all her castmates.

Childhood sweethearts Lauren and Mark became engaged on TOWIE, after both starring since its inauguration in 2010, and were a couple for 11 years before suffering an extremely acrimonious break-up which has led to much mud-slinging. 

Despite their bitter split, the Celebs Go Dating star brushed aside their past drama to upload images of them winning the Audience Award at the 2011 BAFTA Awards.

The media personality wrote in an accompanying caption: '10 years ago changed my life we created a show called 'the only way is Essex' I was 22 when I first started filming and what an amazing journey this has been !!

'I put my life on national television and we won a BAFTA - not a lot people can say that ! You've seen me laugh, cry, engaged, break ups and make ups ! I've grown up on the screens and it was all real! 

'Congratulations to all the OGs @towie these images are from google thank you for memories and well to all my costars im proud of you all and always will be.' (sic)
