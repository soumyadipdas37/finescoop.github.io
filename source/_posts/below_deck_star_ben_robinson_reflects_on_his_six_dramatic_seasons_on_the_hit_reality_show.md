Below Deck and its spin offs follow the drama of the yacht's crew as they work around the clock to fulfil their rich guests' every whim, while dealing with their own romance rollercoasters and friendship fallouts.

Speaking to Lorraine on Wednesday, Ben, 39, who starred in the very first season in 2013 and went on to appear in six series overall, admitted he has very few regrets about his time on the show. 

'You can't live in regret, luckily I haven't - I've been able to progress and I've had a good platform,' he explained.

But he did admit there were 'moments I wasn't proud of.' 

'More because of my mum, she doesn't need to see me walking down the dock with my underwear off and socks off!' he confessed.

While his own mother may have been cringing, Ben told Lorraine he's been delighted with the response he's had from viewers in his home country.

'I love that the Britis like me, I was always quite pensive how the general British public thought of me, obviously I'm quite posh! I am very thankful the British are taking to me.' 

All at sea: He also reflected on his relationships on the show, admitting his on/off romance with Kate was doomed from the start

Time of his life: s for his own job on board, Ben gushed that it was the role of a lifetime as it provided him with the opportunity to experiment in the kitchen

He also reflected on his relationships on the show, admitting his on/off romance with Kate was doomed from the start. 

'She didn't really provide the structure I look for... you know, Kate is good at her job, like most people on Below Deck, they'e punching above their weight, they haven't had these positions ever before.'

As for his own job on board, Ben gushed that it was the role of a lifetime as it provided him with the opportunity to experiment in the kitchen.  

'We're lucky in the sense we don't have a budget, when you can buy lovely stuff, it's good, I enjoy it, I still love cooking, I've been blessed with that.'  

Ben has gone on to set up his own successful catering campany on the West Coast of the US after learning his trade on board yachts and working at top restaurants including Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck.
