Restrictions on weddings in South Australia will be eased from midnight on Friday. 

Private functions, such as weddings, with a maximum cap of 150 people can now stand while drinking and dancing.

The South Australian Government confirmed on Thursday that restrictions will be eased, allowing 'vertical consumption' of alcohol and dancing in licensed premises.

Guests and revellers were required to be seated at all times at private functions under previous restrictions. 

The state's hospitality industry is keen for the lifting of measures that prevent people from drinking while standing in pubs, restaurants, and other venues.

The fitness industry has also asked for fans to be allowed in gyms ahead of warming weather in coming months.

Both groups believe the changes would not present undue risks to the community.

South Australia reported no new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday and has no active infections.

The state has had only 40 cases in the past five months.
