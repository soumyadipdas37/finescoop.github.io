A cat in Pennsylvania left its owner disgusted after launching into a hilarious sneezing fit and firing spit onto their laptop screen.

Five-year-old rescue cat Poptart was sat with owners Emily, 29, and Zach Dale, 30, at their home in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, when she began sneezing.

In a video shared on social media, Poptart launches into a sneezing frenzy and unleashes around 20 sneezes in just 11 seconds.

Poptart the five-year-old rescue cat launches into a fit of sneezes at her home inÂ Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, spraying spit on her owner's laptop

Poptart is sat close enough to Zach and his computer that when she starts sneezing, her bodily fluids shower the screen.

As he drags his screen away from Poptart in a desperate attempt to protect his computer, Zach is heard saying: 'Oh no. Look at those boogers!'

The sneezing fit had been caused by Poptart sniffing Zach's lunch.

Speaking about Poptart's sneezing fit, Emily said: 'Poptart never sneezes once, it's always rapid fire for her.

Owner Zach Dale, 30, tries to pull his laptop away while Poptart continues to sneeze. In the space of 11 seconds, Poptart sneezed around 20 times

'She has been to the vet and they said nothing is wrong, she's just a dramatic sneezer.

'I thought it was hilarious, as did my husband, although he was also impressed by her massive snot rocket and concerned for the laptop screen that was getting blasted by boogers.'

The video was originally posted on Instagram on August 24 on a page called 'THE CAT SQUAD' and has recently re-emerged.

The page features the adventures of a group of cats, including Poptart, and a corgi called Potato.
