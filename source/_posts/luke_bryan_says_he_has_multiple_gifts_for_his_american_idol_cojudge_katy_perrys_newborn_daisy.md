He's bursting with excitement about his colleague's good fortune, and can't wait to be addressed as 'Uncle Luke'.

Country star Luke Bryan spoke to Entertainment Tonight on Monday, during which he spoke about the multitude of gifts he has set aside for his American Idol co-judge Katy Perry's newborn daughter Daisy Dove Bloom.

Katy, 35, gave birth to her little girl last month, with fiance Orlando Bloom.

'I have multiple gifts for this child that require massive packaging and boxing, so Katy, get ready!' Luke, 44, enthused. 

'Whatever she needs to be a country girl, outdoor girl, I've got it all going to Katy and Orlando.'

'Uncle Luke's got it handled,' the Crash My Party crooner added.

Bryan also said that he got his first look at little Daisy Dove while video chatting with Katy recently.

'We were talking about some other stuff, but I got to see my first pictures of that beautiful human being,' Luke said. 

'I'm so happy for them and can't wait to see her in person!'

He won't have to wait too long, as Bryan, Perry along with Lionel Richie will all be returning for season 4 of American Idol as judges, set to begin production sometime later this year.

'We will be in person, together,' Bryan confirmed. 'One big happy, crazy family giving Lionel anxiety.'

And baby Daisy doesn't only have her 'uncle' Luke at her beck and call with gifts – on Sunday, her mom Katy revealed that her once-frenemy Taylor Swift gifted them a lovely hand-embroidered pink satin baby blanket back in May while Perry was still expecting.

'Miss Daisy Dove adores her hand embroidered blankie from miss @taylorswift' Katy captioned a duo of shots showing the blanket which says 'Baby Bloom' along with a sweet card.

'hope it’s one she drags around for years till it becomes an unrecognizable shred that she keeps in her pocket as a teenager ♥️'  

Meanwhile, country fans will be able to catch both Luke Bryan as well as Taylor Swift at Wednesday's ACM Awards on CBS. 

Both will be performing.
