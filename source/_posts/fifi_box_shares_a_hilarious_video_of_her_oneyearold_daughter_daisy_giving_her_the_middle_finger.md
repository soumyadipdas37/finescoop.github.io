Fifi Box's one-year-old daughter, Daisy, didn't seem too happy about being interrupted during her dinner.

The toddler was finishing off a bowl of pasta when she cheekily flipped her 43-year-old mum the middle finger.

In a video posted to Fifi's Instagram on Wednesday, the radio host can be heard laughing from behind the camera.

Covered in pasta sauce, Daisy pulled a series of funny faces as her mum filmed her, bunching up her nose, pursing her lips and squeezing her eyes shut.

She then began repeatedly shaking her head while smirking, before subtly rubbing her nose with her middle finger, leaving Fifi in hysterics as she filmed the interaction.

'Happy little pasta eater (and yes I think she flipped the bird at me),' she captioned the video, adding a crying-with-laughter emoji.

And fans couldn't get enough of the playful video, calling Daisy 'too cute' in the comments section.

In addition to Daisy, Fifi is also a single mum to a seven-year-old daughter, Trixie, who she shares with ex Grant Kenny. 

In an interview with Show + Tell in October 2015, Fifi spoke about her life as a single mum, and confessed she doesn't get too overwhelmed.

'I'm at a stage in my life where I feel like I've achieved all the things I set out to achieve,' she explained.

'Motherhood was a challenge that I always hoped would maybe come along one day, which I looked forward to, and for me, it's my soul.

'I've always felt it would be very natural, and I've always felt I am very maternal anyway, so for me, it's just the biggest blessing.'
