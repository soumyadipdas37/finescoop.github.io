A mutli-million dollar five-bedroom home on Sydney's north shore featuring an Italian-tiled pool, gas fire place, gym and library has hit the market. 

But there's one particular room in the St Ives home on Flinders Street that's turning heads.

The $5million dollar mansion also boasts one of the best man caves in Australia complete with it's own elevator to the rest of the house.

The sitting room with fishing gear and indoor plants was set up in the home's six-car garage and even has its own elevator 

David Walker, from Ray White Real Estate, says the buyer will likely be a luxury car owner who appreciates the large garage 

The man cave was set up in the home's six-car garage after a lengthy battle with the local council.     

'It's very difficult in Ku-Ring-Gai to get that sort of garage space approved, so the over-sized garage and man cave is actually quite rare,' the man tasked with selling the prestigious home, David Walker, from Ray White Real Estate told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It took the owner over 12 months to get it approved so it's unique to be able to buy such a great house with the garage space to boot.'

Mr Walker said whoever buys the luxurious home which goes under the hammer on Saturday September 19, is likely to be someone with a collection of high-end cars.  

Three-storey home on Flinders Street in St Ives goes up for auction on September 19 with large crowd expected to turn out 

The guide price for the mansion which is only a stone's throw from Sydney's Northern Beaches is about $4.9million 

After three weeks on display 142 groups have viewed the home. Pictured: The spectacular Italian-tiled pool 

'The buyer will be someone who wants a place to escape to and is looking for a place to store their luxury cars,' he said.

Despite the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Walker said when it comes to these type of homes, there is still a 'strong amount of interest'.

The guide for the property is about $4.9million and so far, after just three weeks on show, 142 groups have viewed the home.  

'COVID hasn't really seemed to affect luxury house sales much at all,' he said. 

'The people with this sort of money to spend are not worried about losing their jobs and if anything they're really taking the opportunity to capitalise on low interest rates.'

'So in this environment it is actually a good time to upgrade.' 

For the lady of the house, there are also custom built-in wardrobes, stone top benches, a freestanding bath and an array of entertaining space both indoors and out.
