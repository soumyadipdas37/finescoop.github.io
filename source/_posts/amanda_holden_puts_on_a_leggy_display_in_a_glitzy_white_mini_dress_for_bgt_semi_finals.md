Amanda put her toned pins on display in the mini dress, while boosting her petite frame with a pair of glittering stilettos. 

The mother-of-two wore her blonde locks in glamorous waves and accentuated her pretty features with a full face of make-up, including a sultry smokey-eye.

Amanda appeared to be posing backstage before heading into the studio to record the third semi-finale of the talent show. 

Wow! Meanwhile, Alesha Dixon, 41, looked equally stunning in a yellow velvet gown, with a ruffled hemline and dramatic statement sleeves

Elsewhere on the show, Magical Bones won the third Britain's Got Talent semi-final.

The magician and entertainer performed a moving routine, inspired by slave-turned-magician Henry Box Brown, on the ITV talent show.

Magical Bones - whose real name is Richard Essien - managed to 'transport' his girlfriend and his son all the way from Canada.

After finding out he had been the judges' choice, and thus won the semi-final, Richard was clearly shocked as he said: 'I'm literally speechless, I don't know what to say. Just thank you, thank you guys so much. You're making dreams come true.'

Host Dec then asked him if he had a routine planned for the final.

He said: 'You've got to come back for the final in a few weeks. Have you thought that far ahead? Do you know what you're going to do?'

After admitting he had, he said: 'Actually I have. I was trying not to think that far ahead but I did have something special in mind, yeah.'

Richard was chosen by the judges - Alesha, Amanda, David Walliams and Ashley Banjo, who is standing in for injured Simon Cowell - as one of the top three contestants alongside singer Sirine Jahangir and dance troupe X1X CREW, who had to take part all the way from India due to coronavirus restrictions.

Whilst all the other judges chose Magical Bones, Amanda - who was outvoted three to one - admitted she would have chosen Sirine.

She said: 'I love him but I would have gone for Sirine.'

It is now up to the public to vote in the other finalist, with Myra Dubois, Ember Trio, Sign Along With Us, Dario the Dinosaur, Bhim Niroula, Sirine Jahangir and X1X CREW in with a chance.
