Fulham are considering signing Lyon winger Bertrand Traore in this transfer window.

Traore has just under two years remaining on his contract at Lyon and the French club are prepared to sell him, as reported by Sky Sports.

If Fulham do pursue a move for the 24-year-old they are likely to face a considerable amount of competition, with Leicester, Everton, Newcastle and Crystal Palace also interested in signing him.
