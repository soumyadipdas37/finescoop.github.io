Chemist Warehouse has launched a better-than-half-price sale on makeup products with $1 eyeliner pens, $2 lipsticks and $3 foundations.

The Australian pharmacy is hosting the special 'spring frenzy' markdowns until September 27 with incredible reductions on palettes, eyeshadow, nail polish and primers.

Major brands like L'Oreal Paris, Maybelline, Nude by Nature, Revlon, Rimmel and Sally Hansen are all included in the three-week long reductions, with customers scrambling to pick up their favourite items.

The Revlon Colorstay Creme Gel Pencils, which usually retail for $23.95, are down to $1 (left) meanwhile L'Oreal Paris' popular Color Riche Lipstick is a record-low $2 when customers would ordinarily have to fork out $21.95 (right)

The products can only be purchased in store or through the brand's Click and Collect system. Shoppers can't have the items shipped directly to their address. 

The Revlon Colorstay Creme Gel Pencils, which usually retail for $23.95, are down to $1 in an almost unbelievable price slash.

Meanwhile L'Oreal Paris' popular Color Riche Lipstick is a record-low $2 when customers would ordinarily have to fork out $21.95 for one.

The Nude by Nature Flawless Foundation, which is normally $39.95, is down to $3 and the Revlon Photoready Airbrush Effect is $3 when it would usually be $36.95.

Some customers couldn't believe the dramatic reductions, writing on Facebook that it was time to 'stock up' before Chemist Warehouse 'changed its mind'.

The $28.95 Maybelline Lemonade Craze Eyeshadow Palette is just $3 for three weeks and the same for L'Oreal Paris' Brow Artist Genius Kit, which has a recommended retail price of $24.95.

The Rimmel Wonderfull Argan Oil Mascara is also $3, down from $18.95.

One woman on social media said she purchased four lipsticks, one lipliner, one brow mascara, a contour and highlighting stick and a foundation buff brush for $25.95, saving herself $135.65. 

'I spent $77 on makeup when I went in and saved $378,' said another lady.  

While each Chemist Warehouse will vary on stock you can choose to Click and Collect from any store, finding one that has the products you'd most like to purchase.
