She's the former Home and Away actress known for her sensational bikini body.

And on Tuesday, Pia Miller was in the gym working hard at maintaining her physique, with motivational help from personal trainer Jono Castano Acero.

The 36-year-old stunner shared a video to Instagram of herself working up a sweat on an AirBike machine.

Projected on the wall in front of Pia was a photo of the actress in bikini from 2018, which originally featured her son Isaiah alongside her, but he was cropped out.

In the video, Jono called the image 'motivation' as Pia peddled furiously before completing her circuit.

'He tortures me,' the Bite Club star later said of her workout session on Instagram.

Pia has been training at Jono's gym in Sydney for the past couple of weeks, and has been sharing images from their sessions.

The Chilean-born model recently reunited with her multi-millionaire boyfriend, Patrick Whitesell, when he visited Sydney earlier this month.

The couple were together for just over a week, before Hollywood agent Patrick flew back to the U.S. on a private jet about a fortnight ago.

Pia and Patrick went public with their romance at a Halloween party in Los Angeles in October last year. It's believed they've been dating since May 2019.

The couple made their red carpet debut when they attended the Oscars together in February this year.

Before dating the super-agent, she was previously engaged to Australian filmmaker and businessman Tyson Mullane, 32.
