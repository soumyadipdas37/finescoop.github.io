Kaia Gerber was seen arriving at JFK Airport in New York City on Thursday.

The 19-year-old supermodel is fresh from vacationing in Mexico with new beau, 23-year-old Jacob Elordi of The Kissing Booth and Euphoria fame.

The daughter of Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber carried a book by Japanese author Haruki Murakami titled Men Without Women.

The photogenic star was very covered up in her designer blue sweatshirt that said MadHappy on front and and long dark gray slacks with Converse high tops.

The Chanel model also had a black purse on her shoulder and was wearing a black face mask with sunglasses that made her look almost unrecognizable.

The star was holding the book which is a collection of short stories about men who have lost the women in their lives, either to death or the woman finding another man.

It makes for interesting reading considering she has started a new relationship with Elordi.

The two looked smitten with each other in Cabo at an upscale resort as they sunbathed in their swimsuits by a swimming pool.

Also present was her mom Cindy and father Rande.

Before that, Kaia and Jacob were seen holding hands and putting their arms around each other while dining out and hitting a gym in New York City.

Both are known for their high-profile love lives. She used to date Pete Davidson of SNL fame but their union was short lived.

And he has been linked to his Euphoria co-star Zendaya, whom he recently wished well after she won an Emmy for their show.

Before that Jacob romanced his Kissing Booth co-star Joey King.

Meanwhile, Kaia previously claimed she has 'faced a lot of struggles' in the fashion industry.

The model has only been working in the business for a few years, but she has already encountered her fair share of ups and downs.

She said: 'There are so many moving parts, especially being part of an industry with so many different people that you face a lot of struggles.

'You have to wake up every day and choose that happiness for yourself, not for someone else and not based on anyone else.'

Kaia also claimed that people only see the the best of her life via social media.

The model acknowledged that her Instagram account isn't an accurate reflection of her everyday life.

She said: 'What you see in the media most times is the highlight reel. It's okay not to be okay sometimes. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to have bad days. Those aren't the days that we're putting on Instagram.'
