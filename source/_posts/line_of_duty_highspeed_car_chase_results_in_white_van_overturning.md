Line Of Duty filming was put on hold following the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Yet it seems shooting for the popular BBC police drama is now back in full swing, judging by the high speed car chase being filmed in Belfast this week.

The chase came to a dramatic end when a white van which was being hunted by gunman in balaclavas was overturned after being boxed in.

The van was pictured coming to a skidding halt after colliding with a red Volkswagen Golf GTD in the city centre of the Northern Irish capital.

The vehicle, which had been escorted by police, was soon surrounded by armed officers wearing full protection gear as they approached the van.

Among the group was newcomer Shalom Brune-Franklin, who could be seen wearing a maroon jacket, jeans and a police protection vest.

The series stars Adrian Dunbar, Martin Compston and Vicky McClure. The show was created and written by Jed Mercurio and is centred on the AC-12 Anti-Corruption Unit led by Supt Ted Hastings [Adrian Dunbar].

Earlier this week Martin marked a decade since he landed the role of DS Steve Arnott with a fun behind the scenes snap on Thursday.

Line Of Duty's first series aired on BBC Two in March 2012, although it's likely Martin would have landed the role many months earlier.

His snap proved the cast have barely changed despite years battling 'bent coppers' in the fictional AC-12. 

Martin shared the snap after filming for series six resumed in early September in Belfast, with showrunner Jed Mercurio admitting he's still hopeful the show will return to screens in 2021.

In a recent photo from the set, Martin posed as his character DS Steve Arnott while sitting behind a glass wall, which appeared to be in a prison.
