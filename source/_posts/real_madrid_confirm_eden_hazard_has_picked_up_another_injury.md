Eden Hazard's hopes of making his belated injury return for Real Madrid have been scuppered after he suffered yet another fitness issue - with the club confirming he has sustained a leg muscle problem. 

The Belgian star has endured a nightmare year at the Bernabeu, failing to settle into the squad as he scored just once last season before an ankle injury ruled him out for a huge chunk of the campaign.  

He has missed his club's opening two LaLiga matches of the season due to the same problem and has not played since a Champions League defeat to Manchester City in early August.

The winger had been hoping to making his long-awaited injury return against Real Valladolid  

There was optimism he would make his comeback against Real Valladolid on Wednesday night, with the Spanish media pressuring him to succeed in his 'second try' after his disaster in 2019-20. But incredibly he has been set back by injury woes again and could miss at least another two weeks.

In a brief statement on Real Madrid's website, the club said: 'After the tests carried out today on our player Eden Hazard by Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a muscle injury in his right leg.'

His turbulent start to his career with Los Blancos continued at the start of pre-season, where he reportedly arrived overweight, although manager Zinedine Zidane has come out in his defence - stressing he did not lack professionalism.

Despite doubts over his condition, the 29-year-old was still named in Roberto Martinez's Belgium squad to face England in the upcoming Nations League clash, with the former Everton boss claiming he had made 'positive' progress.

But Martinez said he needed to feature in Madrid's next few games to have a chance of making it into his team, with the game against the Three Lions at Wembley coming up on October 11. 

'The news has been very positive in the last two weeks,' Martinez said. 'The work has been really, really good and now we expect that Eden can conclude the final part of his, if you want, bit of pre-season with the game that they have tonight and the game on Sunday,' Martinez told a press conference.

'If Eden could be involved in those two games, he will come into the national team.

'If, for a reason, Eden is not involved in those two games then he will carry on working individually with Real Madrid and he wouldn't be involved in the games with the national team, as you would expect.'  

Earlier this month he was called up for international duty in the UEFA Nations League, only for the player to not play a single minute of the two matches against Denmark and Iceland, with the Spanish press questioning the decision.

Reports in Spain suggested that the club felt Hazard should have not reported for international duty and should have stayed with Real to work on his fitness.

His decision to join up with the national team meant he missed 10 days of pre-season training, leading to further criticism of the 29-year-old.
