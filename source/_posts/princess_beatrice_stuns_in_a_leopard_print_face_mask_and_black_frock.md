Her sister Princess Eugenie revealed she was pregnant yesterday, and Princess Beatrice has been spotted no doubt celebrating the announcement.

The Queen's granddaughter, 32, was seen on Thursday leaving a Mayfair restaurant, in central London, with her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.

Looking effortlessly chic, Beatrice, who was married in a private ceremony in Windsor, in July, stunned in a leopard print face mask and black frock.

Yesterday, Buckingham Palace announced that Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank are expecting their first child together.

Looking every inch a princess, Beatrice wowed during her date night out in a billowing dress, embellished with golden feathers.

The shimmering detail highlighted her sun-kissed skin, while the cinched-waist and keyhole detail showcased her slender frame.

She teamed the eye-catching garment with a matching pair of shoes and clutch bag, while boasting a smattering of glamorous makeup.
