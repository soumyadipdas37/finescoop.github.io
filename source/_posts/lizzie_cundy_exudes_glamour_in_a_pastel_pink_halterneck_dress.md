The good times continued on Tuesday evening as Lizzie Cundy let her hair down at popular London nightspot Annabel's. 

Just hours after tripping out of her lavish Hampshire home, the former WAG was back in the capital for an appearance at the legendary Mayfair venue.

Looking appropriately glamorous, Lizzie, 52, caught the eye in a pastel pink halterneck dress with a lace hemline.

The thigh-skimming number ensured her tanned legs were on display as she posed for photos before making her way inside. 

Lizzie added to her look with a pair of strappy nude Louboutin heels, while a smart black leather handbag rounded things off.

Evidently in high spirits, the characteristically upbeat brunette showed no signs of tiring as she exited the venue with a goodie bag later that night.

Earlier that day Lizzie caught the eye for all the right reasons as she stunned in a chic wrap dress complete with a plunging neckline while leaving her Hampshire home.

The ensemble inevitably drew attention to her cleavage and lean legs as she made her way towards her car. 

With her hair styled into bouncy waves, the former grid girl accentuated her complexion with neutral-toned make-up.

In August Lizzie stepped out for dinner with Lady Kitty Spencer's wealthy Italian ex Niccolo Barattieri di San Pietro.

The businessman has previously been linked to model Elizabeth Hurley after they were spotted having a date together in Mayfair back in 2018.

His white Maserati was also said to be spotted regularly outside her Chelsea home at the time.

The property developer previously dated Princess Diana's niece Lady Kitty, however they called time on their romance in 2017.
