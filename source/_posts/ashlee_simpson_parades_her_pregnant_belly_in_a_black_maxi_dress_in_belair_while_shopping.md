Simpson also shielded her eyes from the sun with dainty black sunglasses.

She toted a paper shopping bag on one arm as she held hands with daughter Jagger, five, as they left the shop.

The adorable little girl was in a lovely pastel pink and blue sleeveless sundress, and pink rubber rain shoes.

Jagger also wore a face mask like her mother, as most ordinances in relation to COVID-19 stipulate that all persons over the age of two wear face coverings.

Jagger is Ashlee's daughter with her second husband Evan Ross.

Evan and Ashlee were married on August 31st, 2014, and she recently celebrated their sixth anniversary with a trio of beautiful wedding snaps on her Instagram page. 

Speaking to ET recently about their marriage, the son of Diana Ross said: 'The biggest thing in this world is being in love. I’m so in love. I love my daughter, I love my wife. She’s given me the best gift in the world. I’m very lucky.'

And in terms of Ashlee and Evan's new baby, a gender reveal event in June revealed she's expecting a boy.

Simpson already has a son Bronx, 11, from her first marriage to musician Pete Wentz which ended in divorce in 2011 after three years of marriage.
