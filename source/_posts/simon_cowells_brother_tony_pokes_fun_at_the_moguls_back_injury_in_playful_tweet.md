His younger half-brother Simon Cowell has been nicknamed The Terminator in recent weeks as he's managed to recover from a six-hour spinal surgery after breaking his back in a bike accident last month.

And journalist Tony Cowell attempted to bring some light relief following his sibling's horrific mishap as he shared a funny tweet on Saturday.

Alongside an image of a standard bicycle, the columnist, 69, wrote: 'A bike. A normal bike. Much safer than electric bike. #Greece.' (sic) 

The funny side of things: Simon Cowell's half-brother Tony attempted to bring some light relief by sharing a playful tweet on Saturday after the mogul's his bike injury (pictured in April)  

Music mogul Simon, 60, has five siblings in total, although only one of them - Nicholas, 58 - is from both his parents Julie and Eric. He had another brother, Stephen, who tragically died as a baby.

Tony's mother was Jeannette Cowell, a former-wife of his and Simon's father Eric, who passed away in 1999.

The writer previously claimed growing up with the Syco boss was 'hell', as he told Star magazine in 2011: 'He was like that kid Damien from the film The Omen.

'He was a really difficult child. He was a naughty teenager... drinking and smoking at an early age.'

TV personality Simon injured himself just a few weeks ago after testing his new electric bike in Los Angeles.

He broke three vertebrae in the fall and has had a steel rod inserted in his back after the painful accident.

On how fast he's bounced back from the painful accident, a source told The Sun: 'One of his friends joked that the metal holding him together makes him The Terminator - which amused Simon.

'He won't mind if that sticks, but the main thing is that he's on the mend.

'The experts are pleased with how things are looking and he's doing physiotherapy at home every day. It's looking good.'

Sources close to the family added to MailOnline: 'He's in good spirits and knows he had a lucky escape and that this could have been worse.' 

Within two days, the X Factor judge was already said to be back on his feet walking around and even taking work calls despite reportedly facing 'weeks' of physiotherapy.

The family insider explained: 'He's doing really well considering everything. He's been walking around already, obviously he has to be careful, which is expected considering surgery was only one day ago. 

'Simon has even been working yesterday and also today he's been on emails on his iPad since early morning. He's in good spirits and knows he had a lucky escape and that this could have been worse,' they added.

It was also recently reported that the entertainment manager had surrounded his hospital bed with healing crystals in a bid to return back to work as soon as possible.    

His Britain's Got Talent co-star Amanda Holden has been promoted to head judge on the show as he is forced to miss the competition's semi-finals to recover, with Diversity star Ashley Banjo filling in his role.
