Direct flights are being introduced to several hidden islands off the coast of Australia.

King Island and Flinders Island in the Bass Strait, between mainland Australia and Tasmania, have been practically deserted since COVID-19 hit.

But a new flight service is hoping to rebuild the local economy by boosting tourist numbers.

Sharp Airlines will begin running three return flights a week between Hobart and King Island and Hobart and Flinders Island from September 30.

Flights will operate on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays for a minimum of $480 return.

During peak season the flights will jump up to $590 return. 

The small planes can only carry a maximum of 18 passengers at one time.

King Island is a well known golfing destination, with the Cape Wickham and Ocean Dunes golf courses ranked among the top five in Australia.

Flinders Island offers a genuine escape to nature for travellers eager to flee the rat race

The beef, dairy and seafood are also a big drawcard for tourists, as well as the island's natural beauty. 

Flinders Island offers a genuine escape to nature for travellers eager to flee the rat race.

Adventure seekers can take part in a range of experiences from hiking to mountain-biking, kayaking and diving.

The island also offers a unique experience for visitors to fossick for Killiecrankie diamonds - a type of topaz known for its blue and pinky-gold hues. 

The Strzelecki National Park, in the south-west corner of Flinders, allows travellers to get up close and personal with native wildlife like wombats, echidnas and potoroos.

The high cost of flights appears to be a deterrent for many on social media.

'Unless the price of flights come down a bit I doubt we will be going. Family of five is a bit expensive!' one woman wrote.  

'Cheaper to fly to the big island, think I will wait it out until borders open,' another wrote.

'This would be unreal,' a third said.

The Tasmanian borders will remain closed to mainland Australia until December 1, meaning for the time being only Tasmanians will be able to take advantage of the flights.
