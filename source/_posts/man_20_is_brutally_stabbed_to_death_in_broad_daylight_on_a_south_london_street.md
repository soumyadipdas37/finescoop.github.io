No arrests have been made and police have issued a Section 60, giving them increased stop and search powers in the area.

It came into force at 3.45pm and will remain in place until 6am on Wednesday.

Police said the victim's next of kin have been informed and witnesses described seeing his mother at the crime scene. 

Pastor Lorraine Jones, who lost her own son Dwayne Simpson to gun crime when he was also 20 in 2014, witnessed the distressing scenes.

She said in a video shared on Twitter: 'I've just been holding a mother who just lost her son.

'I'm witnessing a police officer in the gentlest way he can apologising that she couldn't be by his side. 

'Why was this young boy stabbed? Why? What is the reason? There is so much that must be tied to it.

'He doesn't have to be a gang member. There are issues with our young people and we are only going to tackle this together, not fighting against one another.

'I've lost my son, I know what she's going through. We need to pull together and help our youth.'

Any witnesses or those with information are asked to call 101 ref CAD 4289/15 Sept.
