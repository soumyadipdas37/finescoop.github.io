She has starred on Bravo's Real Housewives of Atlanta since 2012 and is known for being unabashedly outspoken. 

And Kenya Moore completely embraced her 25-pound weight gain that she attributed to 'quarantine.' 

But of the change in her weight, the 49-year-old 'I don't mind if you don't mind,' in an Instagram post on Wednesday.   

Embracing change: Kenya Moore completely embraced her 25-pound weight gain that she attributed to 'quarantine.' But of the change in her weight, the 49-year-old 'I don't mind if you don't mind,' in an Instagram post on Wednesday 

The Deliver Us From Eva actress shared a glamour short in a bright coral body-con dress. 

Her curves were highlighted in the tight cut, with scrunch tied sides and and asymmetrical one shoulder. 

Kenya placed one side on of her thigh, as her other rested behind her head and flowing long black hair. 

'183 lbs,' she wrote in the caption.'The Quarantine has added 25lbs to my 5'10 frame. I don't mind if you don't mind.' 

Statement: The reality TV star went on to share more photos to social media on Thursday, in a bright blue top, with large statement ruffled sleeves 

She went on to add the tag '#lovetheskinyourein.' 

The reality TV star went on to share more photos to social media on Thursday, in a bright blue top, with large statement ruffled sleeves.

'Firmly grounded,' she captioned the smiling snap. 

Also on Thursday, it was announced her Real Housewives co-star Nene Leaks was departing the long running branch of the franchise. 

The 11 season veteran announced that she was done with the Bravo favorite in a YouTube video on Thursday.

In the clip Leakes, 52, said that she decided she was done with the show after going through 'exhausting' and 'emotional negotiations with the network. 

Au revoir! Also on Thursday, it was announced her Real Housewives co-star Nene Leaks was departing the long running branch of the franchise 

The two have been co-stars since Kenya joined she show in season five. 

They have had plenty of drama during their time together, with Kenya slamming Nene after the recent season finished airing in June. 

Talking exclusively to DailyMail.com, Kenya labeled Nene a 'hypocrite' for attempting to give her marriage advice on last season's RHOA as she 'already knew’ about NeNe's rumored secret fling, and wants her rival to 'get help' before they ever come face-to-face on the show again.

Nene, 53, had allegedly been having an affair with Rodney A. White, 54, while still married to her 65-year-old husband Gregg Leakes. 

In happier times: The two women have been costars on the bravo show since Kenya joined the show in season five. During their time together they have had bitter arguments with Nene appearing to spit in Kenya's face during an episode that aired in March (together in 2017)

NeNe hasn't publicly addressed her relationship with Rodney, a veterinary stockpile director, but multiple outlets have reported their relationship is romantic. 

A rep for Nene told DailyMail.com in part: 'Kenya stated herself that she and Nene have not been on speaking terms for almost two years now, so it makes no sense for her to speak with such familiarity about Nene's personal life.'

In an episode of the show in March, after a heated discussion, Nene appeared to spit in Kenya's direction as she shouted, 'I'll spit in your mother f***ing face!'

Reflecting on it, Kenya says: 'You know honestly I am concerned about her [general well-being], there's so many times when it appears that she's just not stable.'
