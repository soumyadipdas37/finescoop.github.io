Liverpool are considering selling Rhian Brewster this summer with a buy-back clause inserted in the move should they want to resign him, according to reports. 

The 20-year-old forward is highly-rated by the Premier League champions by may struggle for minutes this season due to likes of Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane as attacking options at Anfield.

The Reds are looking to improve on their title-winning squad from last season and could use Brewster's £20million price tag to fund these moves.

Brewster had a successful loan spell at Swansea last season, scoring 11 goals in 22 games 

And according to Sky Sports, the Reds will look to insert a buy-back clause in the young Englishman's contract if they do decide to sell him on this summer.

Brewster spent the second-half of the 2019-20 season on loan at second tier side Swansea City and helped Steve Cooper's side reach the Championship play-off semi-finals over the summer. 

The on-loan Liverpool scored 11 goals in 22 games for the Swans and his performances caught the eye of several top-flight clubs this summer.

Aston Villa, Brighton and Sheffield United are all reportedly interested in bringing in the striker in any sort of deal during the current window while Newcastle also registered interest in a loan deal but Liverpool felt Brewster would not get any game time at St James' Park.

The Magpies have Joelinton and Allan Saint-Maximin as attacking options while they have just signed Bournemouth duo Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson in the market this summer. 

Reds manager Jurgen Klopp has only handed Brewster four competitive appearances in his Anfield career, with the latest one coming in August's Community Shield defeat to Arsenal.

Brewster skied over a spot-kick in the penalty shootout as the Gunners ran out winners following a 1-1 draw in normal time at Wembley. 

The 20-year-old is yet to find the net in a competitive game for Liverpool, but did score in his side's pre-season friendly at Red Bull Salzburg earlier this summer. 

Brewster arrived at the Anfield youth academy from Chelsea in 2014 after six years in the Stamford Bridge youth set-up.
