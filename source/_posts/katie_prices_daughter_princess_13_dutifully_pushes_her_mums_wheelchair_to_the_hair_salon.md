Katie Price treated her daughter Princess to a pamper session on Friday. 

The former glamour model, 42, is recovering from the surgery she underwent earlier this month after breaking her ankle and feet in a horror accident during a holiday.

As she remains wheelchair bound, her daughter, 13, who she shares with ex Peter Andre, was pushing her into the salon, where they got matching hairdos.

Katie looked in high spirits as she appeared with her daughter, who proved the apple doesn't fall from the tree as she was snapping selfies just like her mum. 

The glamour model was wearing a blue tracksuit, while Princess wore a bright yellow jumper with a contrasting crimson scrunchie ahead of her makeover. 

Earlier in the week, Katie received a hot pink scooter to travel around in as she continues to recover from an operation on her broken feet. 

The star will now be able to travel around near her home on the scooter. She is currently in the middle of a two year driving ban.

A source told MailOnline: 'Katie will be able to claim back a bit of independence. The scooter has been given a total make over by Robbie at Valetmagic... 

'He reached out to Katie offering his team to work their magic, putting a smile back on her face will certainly be speeding up her recovery.'

The star added to The Sun: 'I won't be breaking any speed limits on this - that's for sure.' The scooter has been customised to Katie's standards and features a 'Pricey' registration plate.

Katie recently revealed she was stepping out of the spotlight on Thursday on medical advice as she has been told to 'rest in order to heal'.

Amid the social media hiatus, Katie appeared in a promotional fake tan video shared on her Instagram on Sunday evening - with her representatives confirming this was a pre-scheduled post. 

They said: 'I can confirm that Katie has not returned to social media.  Katie's team posted the Instagram and this was not posted by Katie herself.

'It was filmed prior to her hiatus.'
