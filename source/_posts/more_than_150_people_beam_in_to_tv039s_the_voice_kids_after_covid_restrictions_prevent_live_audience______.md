More&nbsp;than 150 people have &lsquo;Zoomed&rsquo; into the hit TV show The Voice Kids after Covid restrictions prevented a live audience from cheering on its young stars.
For the first time, ITV invited a virtual crowd to watch the series finale via videolink to create an atmosphere at Manchester&rsquo;s Media City.
Those watching were emailed a Zoom link and the footage of them cheering on the finalists beamed around the studio.
They were also allowed to vote for their favourites on the programme, which was pre-recorded last weekend.
More than 150 people have &lsquo;Zoomed&rsquo; into the hit TV show The Voice Kids after Covid restrictions prevented a live audience from cheering on its young stars.
The contestants were coached by music stars Paloma Faith, Pixie Lott (pictured), Will.i.am and Danny Jones from the boyband McFly
An ITV source said &lsquo;It was good to be able to give the contestants some support.
&#039;It created an amazing atmosphere, though it was a shame there were no hugs or high fives.&rsquo;
The finale featured four contestants &ndash; George Elliot, Victoria Alsina, Dara McNicholl and Justine Afante &ndash; who had been whittled down from thousands who turned up to auditions before lockdown.
They were coached by music stars Paloma Faith, Pixie Lott, Will.i.am and Danny Jones from the boyband McFly.
The contest, which has around four million viewers, is the only one of its kind to stay on screen during the pandemic.
Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent had to push back its live shows scheduled for May while The Voice was axed with three shows to go.
