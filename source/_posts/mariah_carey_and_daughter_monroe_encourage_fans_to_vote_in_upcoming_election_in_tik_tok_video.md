Mariah Carey's nine-year-old daughter Monroe has gotten plenty of world-class coaching when it comes to her passion for singing from her superstar mom, as seen in videos shared on TikTok.

Well the mommy-daughter tandem are back at it again, only this time the dynamic duo teamed up for a TikTok video to encourage fans and followers to vote in the upcoming elections in the US.

And they did it by doing a choreographed dance and sing-a-long to Carey's new socially-conscious single, Save The Day, which features singer and rapper Lauryn Hill.

Rock the vote: Mariah Carey and her daughter Monroe, nine, encouraged people to vote in the upcoming elections with a new TikTok video

In the video, the superstar singer stood just behind her daughter in an all-black ensemble of skinny jeans and a 'vote' t-shirt.

With a proud smile lighting up her face, Carey moved to the steady dance beat in black heels and her dirty-blonde tresses styled long and flowing with a part in the slight right.  

Monroe, who's daddy is actor and comedian Nick Cannon, wore a nearly identical black outfit, only she went shoeless and wore a t-shirt that read: 'Your vote matters'.

Moving in stereo: The mother-daughter duo did a choreographed dance and sing-a-long to Carey's new socially-conscious song Save The Day

The pair moved in tandem as they sang along to the catchy chorus of Save The Day.

'If he won't and she won't -- And they won't, then we won't -- We won't ever learn to save the day,' the lyrics read in a reference to encourage people to try and make the world a better place.

'Oh, if he won't and she won't -- And they won't, then we won't -- We won't ever learn to save the day.' 

The idea: Save The Day was originally written to be a charity song in 2011, but Carey and Jermaine Dupri held it back until they got it right and release it at the perfect moment

Save The Day, which was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, James 'Big Jim' Wright, and Norman Gimbel, is a long time in coming.  

Originally penned in 2011, the idea was to conceive the song as a charity single. But as time went on Carey and Dupri decided to hold it back until they got it right and release it at the perfect moment.

Dupri expressed his feelings about the state of the world back in 2011 and the inspiration for the song. 

'The inspiration for the song comes from Points of Light Institute, the largest enabler of voluntary action in the nation, an organization that inspires, equips and mobilizes people to take action that changes the world,' he said in part, according to Mariah Carey Fandom.         

Deeper meaning: Save The Day is meant to encourage people to make the world a better place

Save the Day is the fourteenth track and lead single, from Mariah Carey's upcoming compilation album, The Rarities, that's slated to drop October 2, 2020. 

The album is part of the #MC30 celebration commemorating 30 years since the release of Carey's eponymous self-titled debut album in 1990.

The 51-year-old New York native also has a son, Moroccan, who's Monroe's fraternal twin.

Carey and Cannon announced their separation in August 2014 after more than six years of marriage.
