Black Friday fever is almost upon us, and this year online retailer Amazon is rolling out the deals a whole week early in what will be its 'biggest ever' event.

That means you can get your hands on fantastic offers on toys, beauty, home and more over an extended eight-day period in the UK.

During Black Friday last year, customers purchased over two million items on Amazon. Popular buys included the much-loved Amazon Beauty Advent Calendar, the Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker and the highly-rated Instant Pot Pressure Cooker - showing the huge range of fantastic deals available on the day.

This year, the sales extravaganza is expected to feature Lightning Deals, limited-time offers, new exclusive-to-Amazon product launches and other big savings.

To find the very best Black Friday deals, it's important to map out a strategy beforehand 

Amazon has confirmed that its Black Friday sale will open at 00:01 on Friday, November 22 in the UK, and last until 23:59 on Friday, November 29. 

This means that this year, the mega-retailer will offer an eight-day sales period on products across its whole range.

As always, Amazon isn't holding back all of its deals for Black Friday - there are a number of fantastic savings to be made on some great products right now.

Have a look at a selection of the best early deals available from the retailer:

The Echo Dot streams music, sets timers and connects with others, and can also track fitness, answer questions, and allow you to voice control your home through connected smart devices. Simply plug the device in, connect to WiFi, and Alexa is ready to go.
