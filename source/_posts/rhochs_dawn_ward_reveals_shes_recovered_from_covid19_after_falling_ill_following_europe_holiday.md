Real Housewives Of Cheshire star Dawn Ward has revealed that she's recovered from COVID-19, after falling ill following her recent summer holiday in Europe.

The TV personality, 47, took to her Instagram Stories on Saturday to reveal that two weeks in bed she was finally ready to be out and about in the world once more.

However, the wife of former footballer Ashley Ward jokingly complained about losing just 4lb, despite having barely eaten and not drinking alcohol while recovering.

Going makeup-free as she addressed the camera from her bed, the mother-of-four said: 'Right, I'm gonna shake this coronavirus off today. 

'I'm officially allowed out of quarantine. I've done two weeks in bed. I've not eaten, I've not drunk any alcohol for 16 days and I've only lost 4lb. Life is just not fair! And I actually think that 2lb of that is my hair extensions!'

Dawn and her family returned to British shores late last month, following a trip to Europe that saw the group sunning themselves aboard a yacht on the French Riviera.

Following a summer filled with post-lockdown travel, she took to her Instagram account to share a selection of shots from her adventures.

Captioning the images, Dawn wrote: 'Sat in my Pjs with [Ashley] looking back at what an amazing summer we have had.

'With my gorgeous family and special friends feeling truly blessed and extremely fortunate to have you all in my life. Not one day goes by I don’t think wow thank you.'

Following the break, Dawn and her two youngest children Charlie, 12, and Aston, 10, isolated at home in Cheshire.

Her illness is believed to have forced a delay in filming of her reality show RHOCH, weeks after cameras finally started rolling again following the nationwide lockdown.

Dawn and former Sheffield United player Ashley, 47, tied the knot in 1995, after the sportsman proposed to her in the car park of the pub where she worked.

The couple have four daughters: Taylor, 23; Darby, 22, Charlie, 12, and Aston, 10.

Since retiring from football in 2005, Ashley has fortified his fortune with a luxury property development company, formed in 2002.

Earlier this year, it was rumoured that Manchester City player Riyad Mahrez was dating the couple's eldest daughter Taylor after splitting from his wife.

A source claimed that the football star, 29, had been on a string of dates with the beauty, after ending his marriage to ex-model Rita Johal.

The source also claimed that Taylor – who in the past has been linked to Riyad's teammate Sergio Ageuro – refused to pursue a romance until she knew his marriage was over, and she even supported him at Man City's EFL semi-final match.

'Riyad and Taylor get on brilliantly, and initially started hanging out as mates. He thinks she's gorgeous, and has joined her and her pals for a few group dates,' the source told The Sun On Sunday.

'They've been friends for a while but Taylor refused to go there romantically until she knew his marriage was over. She is very much a girls' girl and would never break that code.

'Taylor is stunning and Riyad’s team-mates have been ribbing him about how he’s been punching above his weight.' 

MailOnline contacted representatives for Riyad Mahrez, Rita Johal and Taylor Ward for comment at the time.
