She commanded attention when she performed at the 10th annual iHeartRadio Music Festival over the weekend.

And Miley Cyrus ensured all eyes were on her once again as she uploaded sizzling photos from her recent set on Instagram on Monday evening. 

In the latest images, the singer, 27, put on a busty display as she laid on a red satin bed, complete with a lavish headboard and a cheetah print blanket.

The Midnight Sky songstress teamed her bodysuit with glittery see-through stockings and matching opera gloves.

Channelling early-Eighties Madonna, Miley accessorised with a selection of silver bracelets, rings, and a cross pendant.

But without a doubt, the centerpiece of the images was the media personality's coif, which featured large blonde curls housed in a fishnet hair net.

The outspoken starlet sold the images with her trademark attitude, serving sex kitten expressions with a blood red lip and heavy eye shadow.

The Wrecking Ball hitmaker raised her feet behind her in what appeared to be classic red-soled Louboutin pumps. 

'Who owns my heart?! ❤️' Miley asked in the caption, along with a skull emoji. 

She tagged both the @iheartfestival as well as her current photographer collaborator Vijat M, who's worked with the likes of Kylie Jenner, Lil Nas X and Paris Hilton in the past.

Some of the images from the shoot made it into the backdrop of her iHeartRadio gig, which saw the former Hannah Montana star perform, among other things, a raw and full throttle rendition of the Blondie classic Heart Of Glass.

For her onstage look, the We Can't Stop crooner modeled another edgy sheer look, this time in a sexy black body stocking with artfully placed paneling. 

Miley has definitely been feeling her Seventies and Eighties rock goddesses of late, sporting a Par Benetar-inspired grown-out pixie haircut and posting vintage images of Blondie's Debbie Harry to her Instagram feed.

Miley's recent look was just the latest of a series in which she's pushed the envelope.

Last Thursday, the TV and music star danced topless in a black and white video clip on her Instagram feed, writing that 'being single means having more alone time to video myself stripping naked to Joan Jett'.

The gifted artist recently broke things off with her beau Cody Simpson, a fellow singer, whom she'd been seeing for 10 months.

It was just the latest breakup in a yearlong period that saw Miley end her decade-long on-off relationship with Liam Hemsworth last August with a divorce, followed by a brief rebound relationship with reality star Kaitlynn Carter.
