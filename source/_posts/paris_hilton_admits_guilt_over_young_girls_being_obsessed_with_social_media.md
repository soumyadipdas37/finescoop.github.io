She claims to have invented the selfie with her former BFF Britney Spears 14 years ago.

And Paris Hilton, 39, who claims to be the original influencer, boasting 12.7million Instagram followers, said she feels guilt over how teens are so obsessed with social media today in her new YouTube documentary, This Is Paris. 

'Do you feel responsible?' she was asked by the interviewer, when talking about 13-year-old girls posting selfies. Paris paused, before replying: 'Yes.' 

'I feel responsible... I helped create a monster': Paris Hilton has admitted feeling guilty over young girls being obsessed with social media in her new YouTube docu This Is Paris 

Iconic: In 2017, Paris claimed she and Britney Spears invented the 'selfie' and while Paris did change the face of 'modern celebrity' for being famous for being famous, this assertion has been disputed

Paris is said to have  changed the face of modern celebrity, becoming 'famous for being famous', with former stylist Kim Kardashian, 39, admitting she learned all she knows about fame from her. 

Talking about how she feels 'responsible' for the rise in social media, Paris said in her docu, that she herself was shocked by how much of her life she dedicates to it. 

'When you add up all those hours... it's literally like years of your life spent just looking at a phone. It's just so beyond,' she said. 

And talking about her guilt, she said: 'Now I see the little girls... they're trying to get the perfect selfie, they're putting the filters on, they can't even look at themselves in the phone without putting a filter. 

Protegee: Kim Kardashian, who used to be Paris's stylist, has said she learned all she knows about fame from Paris (pictured together in 2006) 

'I can't even imagine being a 13-year-old girl today,' she explained.

'Everyone says I'm the original influencer but sometimes I feel like I helped create a monster.' 

Paris admitted she spends around 16 hours a day on social media as she connects with her fans.

She also said she feels closer to some of them than her own friends, calling them Hiltonites, because they care so much about her and admitting she mistrusts many people in her life.

Back in November, 2017, Paris shared a couple of pictures of herself with Britney which had been taken in 2006. 

She captioned them: '11 years ago today, Me & Britney invented the selfie!' 

And when her claim to the title was disputed by some, Paris simply tweeted: 'Jealousy is a disease get well soon.....' 

She said: 'Now I see the little girls... they're trying to get the perfect selfie, they're putting the filters on, they can't even look at themselves in the phone without putting a filter'

She also said: 'Everyone says I'm the original influencer but sometimes I feel like I helped create a monster'
