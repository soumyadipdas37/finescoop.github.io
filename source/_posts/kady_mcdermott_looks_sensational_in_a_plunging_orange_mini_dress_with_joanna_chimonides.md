She rang in her 25th birthday with a getaway in the Scottish Highlands last week. 

Yet Kady McDermott kept the celebrations going as she also enjoyed a lavish dinner with gal pal Joanna Chimonides, 23, on Thursday. 

The Love Island beauties had all eyes on them as they made a glamorous arrival to the Ivy Asia St Paul's in London.

Kady was a vision of beauty in a burnt orange mini dress with a plunging neckline that offered a look at her ample cleavage. 

The thigh-skimming garment also showcased her tanned and toned pins, which were elongated with a pair of gold barely-there heels.

Kady completed the look with an oversized black clutch bag and styled her glossy locks in a voluminous high ponytail. 

Joanna looked equally as glamorous for the night out as she slipped into a baby blue mini dress layered beneath an oversized blazer.

The girls' night out came after Kady returned from a weekend away in Scotland.

The influencer documented her romantic stay in Glasgow after being whisked away by on/off boyfriend Myles Barnett, 26.  

She recently left fans confused after announcing she is still with Myles and they will live in their new home 'as a couple', weeks after confirming yet another 'break-up'.

The brunette previously took to social media to confirm she will be living in her renovated bungalow with former TOWIE star Myles, 26, when it is finished.

The duo bought a Hertfordshire property together in April 2019 with plans to completely transform it into a two-storey house. 

The brunette blamed their split on the pressure of the build which caused them to argue, as she joked that their renovation has been more stressful than having a baby.

She wrote: 'Just to stop all the personal dms because we are literally get one every single minute, which is understandable. 

'Me and Myles are will both be living in this house as a couple, couples do argue. It is a very exciting time for us both but also ridiculously stressful.

'Me and Myles can't wait to live in our forever home and will continue to share our journey with you.'

'Now I understand when people say renovating/moving home is more stressful than having a baby.' (sic)
