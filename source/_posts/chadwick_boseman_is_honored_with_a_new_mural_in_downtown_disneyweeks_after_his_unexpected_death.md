Four weeks after the death of Chadwick Boseman, Disney unveiled its powerful new mural memorializing the late Marvel star in Disneyland's Downtown Disney District.    

The tribute, which was created by concept artist Nikkolas Smith, showcases a young fan and Boseman exchanging the Wakanda salute, which involves crossing your arms in the shape of an X over your chest. 

As a young child in a Black Panther face mask looks up at the icon, the adoring fan can be seen sporting a blue hospital gown.

The touching portrait nods to his frequent trips visiting sick children in hospitals, as he privately fought a four-year-long battle with colon cancer. 

'As a former Disney Imagineer, I had the honor of working on a major children’s hospital initiative and Avengers Campus as my final two assignments. Seeing Chadwick’s heart for people in-person, and later discovering his courageous battle with cancer, I was inspired to create this tribute to honor his life and legacy,' Smith wrote in the mural's inscription. 

He concluded: 'To us, he was and will always be T’Challa. Long Live The King.'

Additionally, the former Disney Imagineer shares a slideshow of images of himself in front of his work on Instagram, including one holding an infant and another doing the Wakanda Forever salute.

While describing making the mural, Smith noted working on his 'King Chad tribute' was a particularly 'special' experience for him.  

'It is a full circle moment for me: my final two projects as a Disney Imagineer last summer were working on the Children’s Hospital project and the Avengers Campus,' he explained.

After Chadwick's death last month, his family said in a heartbreaking statement: 'It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman. 

'Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV.

'A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much.'

'To millions of kids, T'Challa was a legend larger than life, and there was no one more worthy to fill those shoes than Chadwick Boseman,' the artist noted in his Instagram caption

The family revealed several of Boseman's recent films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, and August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, were filmed 'during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy.

'It was the honor of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther. The family thanks you for your love and prayers, and asks that you continue to respect their privacy during this difficult time.'

The actor is survived by his wife Taylor Simone Ledward and a parent, and had no children.
