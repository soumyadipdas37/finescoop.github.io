The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert chose Irena Srbinovska as his winner during Thursday's shocking grand finale.

And now the new couple have spoken about their sex lives during a revealing chat with KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O. 

The duo appeared on the show on Friday and revealed they slept together for the first time after they filmed the finale, as former Survivor star Locky joked it lasted 'thirty seconds.'

'Let's move to the sex. On the first night, the first time you had sex. Who initiated that and who got nude first?' host Kyle said.

Locky explained that he was feeling emotional after filming the finale and dumping Bella Varelis, so he and Irena got to their room and just talked and relaxed, before eventually getting intimate.  

'We did the finale and it was such a big day and I was crying my eyes out so I wasn't the most masculine,' Locky said.

'Then we got back and were in the room together and we didn't go at it, we just sort of sat there, laying and just talked.' 

He added: 'We didn't do anything... the whole time everyone was asking, "oh don't you just want to bang her?" For me, it wasn't that... there was not a point I was like, "yeah yeah yeah."

The hosts then asked them to clarify if they slept together on the night after the finale, when Locky coyly said they did.

After one of the most tense finales The Bachelor has ever seen, Locky chose Irena as his leading lady during Thursday's night's emotion-filled episode.

In a twist no one saw coming, the 31-year-old told both Irena and rival Bella Varelis he had fallen in love with them - leading both to believe they had won his heart.

But ultimately, it was down to earth nurse Irena, 31, who stole the burly adventure man's heart - leaving Bella, 25, completely devastated.

After a distraught Bella stormed off set, Locky came face-to-face with Irena to deliver the good news - telling her he 'couldn't wait' to spend the rest of his life with her.

He told her: 'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole, whole package.'
