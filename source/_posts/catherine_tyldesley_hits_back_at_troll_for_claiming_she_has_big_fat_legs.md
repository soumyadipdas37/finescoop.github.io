Catherine Tyldesley has hit back at a troll who claimed she has 'big fat legs'.

The former Coronation Street star, 36, took to Instagram on Monday to call out the social media user as she insisted: 'This s**t don't wobble.'

Referencing her strict workout schedule, the actress proved she's proud of how far she's come from being a size 22 teen as she added: 'I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.'

The Strictly Come Dancing star addressed the naysayer directly as she said: 'It's not often your Auntie Cath gets trolled, I'm very lucky like that. I've got lots of wonderful, positive people in my life.

'You do get the occasional twonk, so to the guy yesterday who said I had 'big fat legs', babes, I've been training these legs for seven years. This s**t don't wobble, and I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.

'So things just got really awkward, really fast, didn't they? God bless ya, darling. Find the light, come on.'

The thespian has gushed about embracing her figure ever since she famously shed an impressive seven dress sizes.

'Keep going': Earlier in the day, the thespian uploaded an image of herself working up a sweat in the gym

In an interview on Loose Women back in 2018, Catherine confessed she would have resorted to having a gastric band fitted as she struggled to control her weight as a size 22 teen. 

The TV star said she would have jumped at the chance to have weight-loss surgery when she was larger. 

Joining a discussion on the rising number of teenagers being fitted with gastric bands, the mother-of-one told Janet Street-Porter, Stacey Solomon and Ruth Langsford her lack of education around food contributed to her gradual weight gain. 

She said: 'I used to be overweight and when I was a teenager my education on food wasn't the best so I was in a desperate place and probably would have jumped on that.'

When asked by host Ruth whether she would have taken an offer of having a gastric band, she added: 'Probably, because I was desperate, but I think the key is education.'

'We need to target the parents as well and make sure the food they're giving them at home is the best.

'I think when you look whatever you eat is either feeding disease or fighting it and that's very scary.' 

The Scarborough star has spoken openly about her weight loss battles in the past, telling The Mirror in 2013 she was motivated to shift the pounds after being told by a director she was too fat for play a leading lady.

Tipping the scales at 15 stone, Catherine's weight plummeted leaving her a size 12, and following the birth of her first child Alfie, the blonde beauty lost another two stone leaving her a size 8 to 10.
