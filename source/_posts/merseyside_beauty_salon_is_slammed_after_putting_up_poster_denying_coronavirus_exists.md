A beauty salon has been slammed after putting a poster in its window denying the existence of coronavirus and telling customers they do not have to wear face masks.

Skin Kerr Aesthetics, Hair and Beauty, in Bootle, Merseyside, shared the notice on its Facebook page, which has since been deleted.

The poster, stuck to the salon window with masking tape, had bullet points saying: 'Covid Free Salon; no masks, we take cash; Covid talk is banned; you can't catch what doesn't exist.'

The bullet points end with '#voodoovirusisbullsh**' and '#wedonotconsent' and states 'please respect the rules of the salon'.

Under rules designed to limit the spread of the disease, hairdressers and salon staff are required to wear surgical face masks as well as clear visors.

Hairdressers and barbershops restarted on July 4, and from August 15 close contact beauty services, including facials and eyebrow treatments were opened.

Around 1,117 people have died of Covid-19 in Merseyside hospitals, with many more deaths recorded in care homes and in other community facilities.

Fears of a second wave are also rising after around 200 school pupils and 21 staff were told to self-isolate after positive tests at schools across the county.

And in the most recent seven-day period of data - August 29 to September 4 - Liverpool registered 133 new cases of the deadly virus.

Furious social media users slammed Skin Kerr Aesthetics for the sign online, with one branding the owner 'irresponsible'.

One man, who tagged police in his Twitter post, wrote: 'Can we do something about this irresponsible business owner - @skinkerr clinic please?'

He added: 'Merseyside already hovering just below levels to have restrictions reimposed.'

Another account warned people to 'avoid' the salon after seeing the sign, adding: 'Getting your hair or nails done in Liverpool?

'Here's one to AVOID. Nice one guys! Doing a great job at flushing your biz down the toilet!'

A woman, who said she was the manager, said she 'did not wish to discuss' the post but claimed she had been threatened with violence.

Merseyside Police told MailOnline: 'Officers will be attending the salon today to speak to the staff and owner to make sure they are aware of their responsibilities.

'We will also be linking in with the local authority, Sefton Council.'
