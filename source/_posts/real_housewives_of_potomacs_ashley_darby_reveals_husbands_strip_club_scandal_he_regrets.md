Real Housewives Of Potomac star Ashley Darby revealed on Sunday's edition of the reality series that her husband Michael Darby was involved in an incident at a strip club in which 'this one woman kept touching him.'

'As far as I know, everything is well... that's why I'm shocked,' Darby, 32, said of the occurrence, just days after sharing on Instagram that they're expecting another child.

She opened up about a past occurrence that took place with Michael, 59, when he returned home from a strip club.

The latest: Real Housewives Of Potomac star Ashley Darby, 32, revealed on Sunday's edition of the reality series that her husband Michael Darby, 59, was involved in an incident at a strip club in which 'this one woman kept touching him'

'One time, he did come home, smelling like perfume,' she said. 'I was upset and he was like, "I'm sorry I was at the strip club." I was pregnant and I was very sensitive.'

She said that after she asked him to to do it again, she presumed he 'stopped going to strip clubs.'

Darby said that Michael told her 'he was at a strip club' in the incident, which took place when she and their one-year-old son Dean were at co-star Monique Samuels' house for a cast trip.

Another co-star, Candiace Dillard, later revealed to Ashley an image of Michael at the strip club.

Good news: The couple announced they're expecting their second child 

Ashley said that she and her spouse 'talked about the issue that Candiace brought up, and he told me he was at the strip club and this woman kept touching him.'

She said that tensions ran high and they slept in separate rooms, 'Michael slept in the baby's room and I slept in the bedroom.'

She said her husband 'regrets' his actions, which he didn't specify, and 'feels bad' about it.

Out and about: Ashley joined (L-R) Robyn Dixon, Wendy Osefo, Gizelle Bryant and Charrisse Jackson-Jordan for Bryant's birthday in Washington, DC on Saturday

On the show, Dillard, 33, said she'd received pictures of Michael 'in his boxers' at a hotel. Bryant, 50, told Dillard, 'I'm minding my business and I had at least 40 DMs about Michael; this is the worst!'

Dillard said there was now 'photographic evidence of Michael at a hotel, Michael at the strip club and Michael at MGM.'

The show's Karen Huger said of the image, 'Michael doing something, but it don't look like it's Ashley.'

Samuels, 36, said that 'in the big scheme of it all, the only person that matters right now is baby Dean.'

Robyn Dixon suggested that Michael show better restraint and 'go home to [his] wife.'

The Real Housewives of Potomac can be seen on Bravo Sunday at 9/8c.
