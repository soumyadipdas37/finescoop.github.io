Queen Letizia of Spain has once again proved that you don't need designer clothes to look like fashion royalty after stepping out in a recycled £70 tweed dress from Zara today.

The mother-of-two, 47, wore the stylish checked number at an event to mark the nation's Cooperative's Day at Madrid's Palacio de Viana, alongside her husband King Felipe.

Putting safety first, the couple both wore masks when attending the occasion, which celebrates professionals who work for sustainable development and fight against poverty.

Letizia showed off her sartorial prowess in the patterned navy dress with a billowing skirt and an asymmetrical neckline. 

The fitted frock - which was part of Zara's 2019 collection - was nipped in at the waist with a thin black belt, which showcased the royal's slender figure.

Her navy slingback heels complemented the casual style of its frayed hem and she accessorised with a simple pair of silver hoop earrings.

The Spanish royal wore her sleek dark hair down and kept her make-up to a tasteful smokey eye and slick of lip gross. 

Letizia previously wore the dress in July 2019 when meeting with the International Congress of the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR).

Looking equally sophisticated today, King Felipe sported a navy suit with a white shirt while standing alongside his wife. 

Every September 8 in Spain, Cooperator's Day honors professionals who work for sustainable development and the fight against poverty together with the most vulnerable populations on the planet. 

Letizia and Felipe have continued to put on a united front amid the ongoing scandal surrounding former King Juan Carlos. 

In August, they visited Ibiza and paid a visit to the Monographic Museum and Necropolis of 'Puig des Molins', said to be the home of the goddess Tanit and the best preserved necropolis in the Mediterranean.

Their trip coincided with the Spanish royal palace confirming the 82-year-old ex-king is residing in the United Arab Emirates, having left his homeland earlier this month after it emerged his finances are under investigation in a major corruption probe. 

Juan Carlos is believed to be staying with his 'most faithful friend for the past 40 years', 70-year-old Mallorcan interior designer Marta Gaya, in a £10,000-a-night presidential suite at the Emirates Palace Hotel. 

In a surprise move, Juan Carlos announced on August 3 that he was leaving Spain to prevent his personal affairs from undermining his son King Felipe VI's reign, but did not say where he would be going.  

King Juan Carlos has denied any wrongdoing and claims he is available should prosecutors need to interview him.
