The NYPD has released the mugshots of a wealthy Upper East Side college student, 20, and six others who allegedly smashed up store windows causing $100,000 worth of damage to New York City businesses during weekend riots. 

Clara Kraebber, the privileged daughter of an architect and psychiatrist, was one of eight people arrested Friday night after a small faction broke off from peaceful protests and vandalized Manhattan store fronts.  

Kraebber is facing up to four years behind bars for rioting and misdemeanor graffiti. 

Frank Furhmeister, 30, of Stuyvesant Heights; Claire Severine, 27, of Washington Heights; Etkar Surette, 27, of Prospect Park South; Jane Buffo, 19, of Lower Manhattan; Jade O'Halloran, 30, of Crown Heights; Adi Sragovilh, 20, of Great Neck; and Elliot Rucka, 20, of Portland, Oregon, were also arrested and face rioting charges.

Kraebber was among those arrested after a vandalism spree on Friday in the Flatiron District. She is an undergraduate at Rice and comes from a wealthy Upper East Side family

'On Friday, September 4th, these individuals were arrested for rioting during demonstrations in Manhattan,' NYPD News tweeted Tuesday alongside the mugs of Kraebber and six other alleged rioters. 

'They were part of a large group breaking storefront windows. Our investigation into this incident continues.'

The group are suspected of being the culprits behind the estimated $100,000 worth of damage wrought on Manhattan businesses Friday night. 

Rioters were caught on surveillance footage smashing the store windows of a Starbucks coffee shop in Soho using umbrellas and other objects, reported the NY Post.   

Six other businesses below West 22nd Street also had their windows smashed including several banks and Duane Reade. 

Three other buildings were also vandalized with graffiti during the three-hour rampage that stretched two miles from Foley Square up to 24th Street, authorities said.  

A protest had been organized that day by the New Afrikan Black Panther Party and the Revolutionary Abolitionist Movement activist groups.

Cops confirmed Saturday that eight arrests were made of people aged 19 to 30 years old for rioting and related charges Friday night

The plan was to march from Foley Square to Chelsea and across to Flatiron, calling for an end to systemic racism and police brutality after several black men and women have been killed by cops in recent months across America. 

It is not clear if any of the suspects arrested are part of the activist groups or if they participated in protests earlier in the day. 

Cops confirmed Saturday that eight arrests were made of people aged 19 to 30 years old for rioting and related charges Friday night. 

Seven suspects are native to New York and the eighth is from Portland.  

Kraebber, a history undergrad at Rice University in Houston, has been slammed for 'hypocrisy' and branded the 'poster child for white privilege' following her arrest.   

'This is the height of hypocrisy,' an anonymous law enforcement source source told The Post. 

'This girl should be the poster child for white privilege, growing up on the Upper East Side and another home in Connecticut.

'I wonder how her rich parents feel about their daughter. How would they feel if they graffitied their townhouse?'

Kraebber comes from wealth, with her family living in a luxury Upper East Side apartment that they bought for $1.8 million in 2016, the Post reported. 

They also own a second home with four fireplaces in Litchfield County, Connecticut.  

Demonstrators march in Rochester, New York, Monday after footage was released by the family of Daniel Prude, 41, showing cops putting a spit hood over his face and pushing his face into the ground for two minutes until he passed out and died on March 23

Thousands have taken to the streets demanding justice and calling for an end to police brutality and racism since May following the 'murder' of black man George Floyd by a Minneapolis cop who knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes until he passed out and died.  

Floyd's death reignited outrage over the death of EMT Breonna Taylor, 26, who was shot eight times while sleeping in her bed when three plain clothes officers performed a no-knock arrest warrant at her Louisville apartment on March 13. 

In June, unarmed father Rayshard Brooks was shot dead while he ran away from cops in the drive-thru of a Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta.  

On August 23, Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by a white cop in front of his three young children, leaving the father-of-six paralyzed from the waist down.      

A week later on August 30, Dijon Kizzee, 29, was gunned down in the street by LA cops who allegedly shot him 20 times and then handcuffed his dead body after trying to pull him over for an alleged bicycle code violation.   

Last week, footage was released by the family of Daniel Prude, 41, showing cops in Rochester, New York, putting a spit hood over his face and pushing his face into the ground for two minutes until he passed out and died on March 23.  

The Monroe County medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide caused by 'complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint' but no charges have been brought against any of the cops.
