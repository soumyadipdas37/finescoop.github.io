Lisa Armstrong did a good deed on Monday when she left out ex husband Ant McPartlin's possessions for people to take. 

No doubt the items were no longer wanted by Ant, 44, so Lisa made sure they went to a good home instead. 

The 43-year-old make-up artist placed them in boxes marked 'Help yourself' and put them out in the street.

Tidy up: The items were easily identifiable as Ant's because they included his Newcastle United shirts and a 'Team Ant' foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway (pictured in 2005)

The items were easily identifiable as Ant's because they included his Newcastle United shirts and a 'Team Ant' foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway.

There was also Ant's old dressing gown and a pile of board games. 

No longer needed was Piers Morgan’s book The Insider and Lisa threw in her own Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales from the Dance Floor - she is Strictly's head make-up artist

Lisa was also throwing out a bowl used by labrador, Hurley, as well as a Banksy artwork calendar and a Jamie Oliver book.

A source told The Sun that Lisa is leaving her West London house and wanted a 'big clear out.'

They added: 'Ant had already sifted through what he wanted to keep and had gophers collect them in recent weeks.

'What was left is being offered for free. His bathrobe has been taken. Footie memorabilia has also been given away. But it was the end for his Newcastle shirts.”

Another source said: 'Some of it is Ant’s, some of it is Lisa’s and some of it they bought together.'

On Tuesday, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said he did not agree with Lisa's decision to throw out these possessions, even though she is divorced.

He was particularly astonished to see she had thrown out his book.  

Piers told co-host Susanna Reid and the audience: 'Ant McPartlin’s ex Lisa Armstrong – who is a wonderful makeup artist, she does my makeup on Life Stories.

Free: Lisa had left a sweet sign advising people to help themselves 

'And I thought we were friends. I really did. I was quite friendly with Ant. Apparently this is stuff that Ant himself didn’t want back.

'These are the unwanted items that neither of them ever wanted to see again. There were things you’d expect, like Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales From the Dancefloor. Wholly understandable. 

'His Newcastle shirt. I wouldn’t want to keep them either. A Team Ant foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway. Again, why would you want that?

'So you have all these things – and in the middle of it, you have a copy of my book, The Insider.'

Later on in the show, Piers said Lisa had contacted him to apologise.  

She told him: '"Oh my god, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t even there. I haven’t even see that book. Are you mad at me?"’ Yes – I am mad at you. No, I just want my book back!' 

Piers Morgan said Lisa had contacted him to apologise for throwing out his book, saying: '"Oh my god, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t even there. I haven’t even see that book. Are you mad at me?"'

Lisa split from Ant in 2018 after 12 years of marriage, and is now reported to be dating James Green. 

Lisa and Ant finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 following the presenter's highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol.

The Saturday Night Takeaway star has continued his relationship with his former personal assistant and girlfriend of two years, Anne-Marie Corbett, 43.  

However last month Lisa appeared to confirm that she was dating her new lover James, after fans reached out on Twitter to congratulate her on the happy news.

Meanwhile, Lisa has named her new cosmetics range after the pals who supported her following her split from Ant.

Moving on: Ant has already taken what he wanted from the house and no doubt he won't mind one bit
