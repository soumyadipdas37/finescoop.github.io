Jamie Carragher has blasted the handball rule, as the Sky Sports pundit labelled the decision to award Newcastle a last-minute penalty against Tottenham Hotspur an 'absolute disgrace'. 

Spurs were looking to see out a 1-0 win over the Magpies on Sunday afternoon when the ball struck the arm of Eric Dier in the penalty area following a late free kick from the visitors.

VAR intervened and referee Peter Bankes was advised to review the incident on the pitchside monitor. After watching a number of replays, the referee pointed to the spot to award Newcastle a controversial penalty.

The visitors were handed a late spot kick after the ball struck the arm of Eric Dier on Sunday

New signing Callum Wilson stepped up and made no mistake in dispatching the spot kick beyond Hugo Lloris to snatch a point at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. 

The 2020-21 campaign has seen a handful of controversial decisions relating to penalties awarded for handball, with Manchester United's Victor Lindelof and Crystal Palace's Joel Ward already harshly punished this season.

And Carragher has vented his fury with the interpretation of the rule, exclaiming that the rule as it is currently followed is 'ruining football'.

Carragher slammed the decision while on commentary, calling for drastic changes to be made

'It’s an absolute disgrace. An absolute joke,' the Liverpool legend fumed over Sky Sports commentary. 

'Newcastle fans will be ecstatic, I can understand that. But everyone else in this country will say exactly what I am saying and what I am thinking. 

'Eric Dier jumps for the ball, has no control of where his arms are going, there is a header half a yard away from him, hits him on the back of the arm, has no idea what is going on.'

Carragher made a direct plea to football's governing bodies to immediately change the way the law is interpreted, so as to stop controversial decisions being made. 

Jose Mourinho was angered by the decision, storming into the tunnel before full time

Mourinho's assistant, Joao Sacramento, was given a red card for complaining to the referee

'This is a joke. Whether it’s the Premier League, the FA, FIFA, [Pierluigi] Collina, whoever’s involved in this – stop it, because you are ruining football for everybody. Absolute joke.'

Spurs boss Jose Mourinho stormed off down the tunnel before the spot kick was even struck, with the Portuguese tactician angered by the late decision.

Meanwhile, it is believed that Joao Sacramento, Mourinho's No 2, was given a red card by Bankes as a result of remonstrating with the referee's decision at full time.

The result means that Spurs have picked up four points from a possible nine so far this season, and take on Mourinho's former club, Manchester United, next.
