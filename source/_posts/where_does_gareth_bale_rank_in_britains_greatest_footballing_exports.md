Gareth Bale finally looks set to call time on his seven-year stay in Real Madrid, after agreeing to move back to Tottenham on loan.

It is a sorry end to what had largely been an incredible period for the Welshman, who has been edged out by boss Zinedine Zidane. 

From stand out individual performances and world class goals to a host of medals, there is little the 31-year-old has failed to achieve during his time in Spain.

But how does his stint abroad compare with other great names to have tested the waters abroad?   

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at where Bale ranks against the greatest Brits to test themselves on the continent and further afield.

10. Paul Lambert (Borussia Dortmund)

Paul Lambert's stay at Borussia Dortmund may have been short, but it was most certainly sweet.

Despite spending just the 1995-96 campaign in the Bundesliga, the Scotsman ended his time in Germany by lifting Europe's most prestigious trophy, becoming the first Brit who could call themselves a Champions League winner in the process.

His performances in the semi-final and final of the tournament have both since been commented on - the midfielder playing a pivotal role as Dortmund dumped out Manchester United over two legs. 

Setting up his side's opening goal in the final against Juventus, Lambert even made Zinedine Zidane look ordinary as the German side ran out 3-1 winners.

9.  Glenn Hoddle (AS Monaco, 1987-1991)

 Hoddle was something of a pioneer when it came to English stars playing abroad. 

There were a couple of factors behind his decision to move to French principality in 1987 - among them the ban on English clubs from competing in Europe - but it is suffice to say that the midfielder's style was perhaps more suited to a more continental brand of football. 

Brought to France by a certain Arsene Wenger, Hoddle immediately proved his worth, grabbing the 'Foreign Player of the Year' award in France's top flight after helping Monaco to the title.

If it wasn't for a knee injury that ended his time at the elite level, the former England boss could have found himself higher on this list.

8. David Beckham (Real Madrid/LA Galaxy/AC Milan/Paris Saint-Germain)

If this list was purely based on commercial impact, this man would be streaks ahead of anyone.

Beckham brought an electric sense of anticipation to every league he appeared in after leaving Manchester United in 2003. 

He was part of the Galacticos at Real Madrid, lifting the Liga title there, before becoming the poster boy on the pitch for MLS. 

His stints with Milan and Paris-Saint Germain were glitzy, but there was always substance added everywhwere he went. 

Titles in the US and France means he has a broader range of titles than any other Brit on the list.

7. David Platt (Bari/Juventus/Sampdoria)

David Platt was something of a hot property in Italy.

Having moved to Bari in 1991, the bigger clubs in the country began to take notice. 

While is stats may not have been the most impressive for a centre forward, his work-rate and ability on the ball saw Juventus come calling for him after just a season.

Although not part of the squad for the final, Platt played his part in helping the Old Lady lift the Uefa Cup in 1992, playing in both semi-final legs. 

After a personal campaign by midfielder Roberto Mancini, Platt moved to Sampdoria to join the Italy international, where he won the Coppa Italia in 1994, before returning to England a more well-rounded forwarded.

6. Steve McManaman (Real Madrid)

Testing himself abroad was something Steve McManaman had always wanted to do and he got that opportunity when leaving Liverpool to join Real Madrid in 1999.

While there was a great deal of success for the former Liverpool midfielder in Madrid, it was his determination to succeed that gained him admiration in Spain.

After finishing his first campaign in fairytale fashion - volleying home one of the goals in the victory against Valencia in the Champions League final - club chiefs attempted to force the England international out of the club.

Offers from Middlesbrough, Chelsea and Lazio were all rejected by the player as he stood firm in the face of their attempts to to sell him to recoup some of their outlay on Luis Figo.

Eventually he was rewarded and fought his way back into Vicente del Bosque's plans. He went on to win another European trophy before moving back to England to join Manchester City.

5. Chris Waddle (Marseille)

Very few Brits abroad earned the kind of affinity with fans that Chris Waddle was afforded by those at Marseille. 

Joining from Tottenham in 1989, Waddle quickly captured the hearts of supporters in the south of France, as he was given the nickname 'Magic Chris'.

He won three French Championships while there, and was a penalty shoot-out away from lifting the European Cup, too.

Such was his standing at the Stade Velodrome that he even felt comfortable reviving his pop career - teaming up with defender Basile Boli to release 'We've got the Feeling'.

4. Gary Lineker (Barcelona/Grampus Eight)

One of England's greatest strikers caught the eye of the world and Barcelona after earning the golden boot at the 1986 World Cup. 

Signed by Terry Venables, Gary Lineker hit the ground running at the Nou Camp, scoring twice on his debut as he went on to grab 21 goals in his first season.

He lifted the Copa del Rey and the European Cup Winner's Cup while playing in Spain and wrote himself into the club's folklore with a hat-trick against bitter rivals Real Madrid. 

After moving back to England in 1989, there was one more stint abroad for the current BBC Match of the Day presenter, spending the final two years of his career at Nagoya Grampus Eight.

3. Gareth Bale (Real Madrid)

On the cusp of calling an end to his time at Real Madrid, nobody should lose sight of just how impressive Bale's contribution has been. 

He arrived as the world's most expensive player and in his early stages he lived up to that and some, with some scintillating individual displays endearing him to fans. 

His solo goal to clinch the Copa del Rey title against Barcelona in the 2014 final was a moment of magic that few are capable of producing, while scoring in two separate Champions League finals demonstrated his place as a phenomenal clutch player.

While his time in the Spanish capital may be coming to something of an acrimonious end, his achievements over the past seven years still set him apart as one of Britain's best exports.

2. Kevin Keegan (Hamburg)

While knocking out an opposition player may not be the most conventional way forward to get yourself onto this list, Kevin Keegan's rush of blood to the head in a friendly in his first season was key to his German success story.

Already established as one of the best player's in the world, the permed supremo left Liverpool to join the middling Bundesliga club - a head-scratcher of a move at the time. 

A poor start to life at Hamburg and an altercation with an opponent in a match against VfB Lubeck forced Keegan to double down and make a fist of his time there.

That resulted in leading them to the Bundesliga title, and there was personal recognition, too as he picked up the Ballon D'Or twice in 1978 and 1979.

1. John Charles (Juventus/Roma) 

In truth, there is no surpassing John Charles, the 'Gentle Giant' who charmed Juventus and Italy with his immaculate behaviour and penchant for goalscoring. 

Never shown a yellow or red card during the duration of his career, Charles moved to Juventus in 1957 for a fee of £65,000 - a British record at the time.

One of the first Brits to move abroad, and still ultimately the best, the 6ft 2in forward was Serie A's top scorer in his opening season as he struck up a formidable partnership with Enrique Sivori and Giampiero Boniperti, the trio nicknamed the Holy Trident. 

He scored 108 goals in 155 matches for the Old Lady, lifting the Scudetto three times and the Coppa Italia twice.

in 1997, he was voted the club's best ever foreign import, and despite not quite htting the same heights when joining Roma in 1962, nobody can doubt his position at the head of the list.
