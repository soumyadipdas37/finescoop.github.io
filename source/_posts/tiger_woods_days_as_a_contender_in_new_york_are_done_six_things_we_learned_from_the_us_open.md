Bryson DeChameau has been crowned the 2020 US Open champion, finally earning the chance to silence his doubters. 

The 27-year-old distanced American debutant Matt Wolff by six points on Sunday, with Louis Oosthuizen eight shots back in third.  

There was plenty to ponder from New York as Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson looks at the six things we learned from the tournament. 

Bryson DeChameau was crowned US Open champion for 2020 on Sunday in New York 

Only Patrick Reed could get barracked at an event where no fans were allowed. 

That didn’t prevent some homeowners erecting platforms in back yards overlooking some of the holes — and they gave the controversial Reed both barrels. 

If ever there was a player secretly thrilled at the absence of 40,000 bloodthirsty New Yorkers, it was him.

Even without crowds by the course Patrick Reed couldn't escape his controversial reputation

Even through the darkest days, when he couldn’t get out of bed owing to his back problems, the mantra was always the same — write off Tiger Woods at your peril. 

Yet here goes. When it comes to the US Open, his days as a contender are done. 

The only majors he can win now are the next two or three editions of the Masters and the 2022 Open at St Andrews.

A feisty reference on social media as to how few fairways Matt Wolff hit over the first 54 holes showed that Lee Westwood is still up for the fight. 

Now 47, he would probably have been making a record-equalling 11th Ryder Cup appearance this week. 

Maybe he will make it next year. And he’s a good each-way bet for the Masters in November.

Lee Westwood, the 47-year-old veteran, showed he still has his fighting spirit at Mamaroneck

A highly-respected coach was having a go at people having a go at Jordan Spieth last week — but who is putting the boot in with regard to the Texan? 

I don’t know a single person in golf who is not willing him to find a way through his current mental maze and recapture his form.

After the sluggers Matt Wolff and Bryson DeChambeau did after three rounds what you are not supposed to be able to do at a US Open, and score well from the rough, the next step in the distance insight project promised by the game’s governing bodies should make interesting reading next March. 

A prediction: there will be blood.

Bryson DeChambeau has continued to upset the traditionalists with his performances 

It Is not often I disagree with Ewen Murray on Sky Sports but I’ll happily take issue with his preference for the birdie-fest on day one over the spills on day two.

If you see 20 scores under par at a US Open, it means the set-up is a betrayal of what the event is supposed to represent. 

It makes it indistinguishable from a top PGA Tour event.
