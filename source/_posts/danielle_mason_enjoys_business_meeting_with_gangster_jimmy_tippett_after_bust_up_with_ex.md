Danielle Mason enjoyed a business meeting with notorious South London gangster Jimmy Tippett at Mayfair's Sexy Fish restaurant on Wednesday.

The former Gypsies Next Door star, 37, appeared in great spirits as she engaged in a lively conversation with the career criminal, who was previously jailed in 2018 for stealing a diamond ring, just months after an identical offence.

Following their outing, Jessie Wallace's younger sister exclusively revealed to MailOnline that Jimmy, 48, has offered her a shoulder to cry on following a 'bad bust up' with her former husband Tony Giles.

The reality star told us: 'He is my mate and we were having a business meeting. I had  a bad bust up with Tony and Jimmy has been really good to talk to.'

Danielle and Jimmy put on a cosy display as they discussed work matters over hot beverages at the Asian eatery.

The mother-of-two called it quits from her traveller spouse Tony in October 2019 after he claimed he was single on social media.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'Danielle saw Tony's relationship status was set to single on Facebook and wasn't happy at all.

"She's spoken proudly of their relationship this year after they got things back on track and feels it was disrespectful.'

The former couple, who share Rudy, nine and Delilah, seven, tied the knot in 2012, but split in 2016 and later reunited. 

The glamour model's new pal Jimmy is the son of south London enforcer and boxer Jimmy Tippett Snr, who counted the Kray twins and Mad Frankie Fraser as family friends.

Known as the 'governor of Lewisham' from the 60s to the 80s, his father ruled his manor with an iron fist, winning every bare-knuckled fight he got into on the cobbles.

Jimmy had planned to make a film based on his book Born Gangster about how he 'first got arrested when he was 12 and, by the time he was 16, was visiting Reggie Kray in prison'.

Two years ago, he returned to prison on a 30-month sentence for stealing a diamond ring not long after he was freed from jail for an almost identical offence.

The court heard that in March 2017 he and an associate tricked the mother of jewellery designer Tatiana Sieff into showing him a diamond and emerald encrusted ring, which he then spirited away while she was in a hotel toilet.  

Jimmy was freed from a 27-month sentence he was given in 2013 for a similar 'confidence trick' theft from another jewellery dealer.

In that case, he then distracted a woman and disappeared with the jewellery, in that case worth about £250,000. It is unclear when he was released from his latest sentence.
