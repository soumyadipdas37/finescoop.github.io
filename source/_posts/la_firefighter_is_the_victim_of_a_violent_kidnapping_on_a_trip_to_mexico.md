Police fear a missing Los Angeles firefighter was the victim of a violent kidnapping during a trip to Mexico.

Francisco Aguilar, 48, vanished more than two weeks ago after he travelled by himself to his condo - which is rented out on AirBnb - near Rosarito, Mexico. 

Police fear the father-of-two - who worked for the LAFD for 20 years - was kidnapped after his property was found ransacked with tables overturned and his motorcycle and jeep gone.

His family say they have not received a ransom request, but police were left 'concerned' after obtaining obtained Ring camera footage from inside the home on the night he vanished.

Authorities have not told Mr Aguilar's worried daughters what the footage shows.

Adding to concerns, his phone is now turned off, his family say, an action not typical of the devoted father.

His daughter Bella told ABC News: We're just so worried sick. Every day is getting harder. Anxiety is getting much worse as the days go on.' 

Addressing her father, his other daughter Amaris said: 'I will go to the ends of the earth for you. And I can't wait until you get back so we can give you a big hug.'

Addressing the press shortly after 5pm, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said: 'We will work tirelessly to make sure that Frank is returned safely. 

'That this is somebody who has put his life on the line for us.'

He added:  'And if this message gets to anybody who would dare kidnap an Angelino who serves the people of Los Angeles.

'Let him go and make sure that he is able to safely return to our city and to his family.'

Mexican authorities are leading the investigation into his disappearance with help from the FBI. 

Homicides are a common concern for visitors travelling to Rosarito and its surrounding locations after drug cartels caused a spike in killings between 2007 and 2010.

Since that point, murder rates have dropped but are still higher in this region than the rest of the county. 

Tourists are not usually the targets of drug-related crimes.
