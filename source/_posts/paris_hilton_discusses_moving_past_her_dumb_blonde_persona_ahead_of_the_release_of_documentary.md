Wow! Paris Hilton proved her ditsy blonde façade was behind her as she debuted a sophisticated new look while speaking to Channel Nine's Today show and Seven's Sunrise on Monday

Paris spoke candidly to Sunrise's entertainment reporter Edwina Bartholomew about why she decided to film the documentary.

'This entire time, I have been playing a character, so the world has never truly known who I am. The real me is someone who is actually brilliant. 'I'm not a dumb blonde, I'm just really good at pretending to be one.'

When asked why she was willing to come clean about her life now, Paris explained: 'It was time for the world to finally know who I was.

'I feel like I've been through so much... there's so many misconceptions and preconceived notions about me.

'I don't want to be remembered as some airhead. I want to be respected for the businesswoman I am.'

'I'm not a dumb blonde. I'm brilliant': Paris spoke candidly about why she decided to film the documentary

Reflecting briefly about her infamous sex tape with then-boyfriend Rick Salomon, filmed at the height of their romance in 2001, The Simple Life star admitted that 'people were so cruel and evil.

'It was so painful to deal with. If that happened today, it would have been a completely different story.'

She also addressed the personal fallout from her fame, confessing: 'I was so lost and lonely. I was having to travel constantly, 250 days out of the year, and was always surrounded by strangers and cameras.

'I never had a chance to think about my real life.'

Drawing upon the success of her businessman father Richard and grandfather Barron Hilton, Paris explained: 'My family have been inspiring. It just runs in my blood to be a businesswoman.

'People just assume I have a silver spoon, and everything has been handed to me, and I've never had to work a day in my life. [But] it's actually the exact opposite.'

Over on the Today show, Paris elaborated on her achievements as a businesswoman, revealing that it was 'something that drives me.'

The former socialite also explained that her YouTube documentary, This Is Paris, was initially intended to be about her life now as a businesswoman.

However, she revealed she became close friends with the documentary's director Alexandra Dean and began speaking about the physical and mental abuse she faced as a teenager at a boarding school in Utah.

'There are families that have approached me who have pulled their children out of that school that I was at because they saw the trailer to my film.

'It's exciting that this is making a difference and going to help save children's lives.'

Paris' wealthy parents Kathy and Richard sent her to many boarding schools following a rebellious phase after living at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City with her family.

Paris spent 11 months at Provo Canyon School, the last in a series of institutions which focuses on behavioural and mental development.

Between 2011 and 2014, police responded to 56 calls for assault at Provo and 25 for sexual offences.

In a statement to People, the boarding school said: 'Originally opened in 1971, Provo Canyon School was sold by its previous ownership in August 2000.

'We therefore cannot comment on the operations or patient experience prior to this time.' MailOnline has contacted Provo Canyon School for further comment.

Elsewhere in the documentary, the heiress opened up about enduring 'multiple abusive relationships' in her life.

Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, whom were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change.

Nowadays, Paris is in a 'safe' and healthy relationship with entrepreneur Carter Reum, who she has been dating for nine months.

This Is Paris is set for release on YouTube on September 14.
