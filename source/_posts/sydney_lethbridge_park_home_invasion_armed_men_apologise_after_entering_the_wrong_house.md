A group of armed men apologised to a family after invading their home and realising they were in the wrong house.   

Samuel and Lupe Aukuso were watching television with their baby daughter and three-year-old son in their home on Mendana Street in Lethbridge Park in Sydney's west at 10:40pm on Monday. 

Suddenly the lights went off, prompting the Mr Aukuso, 29, to go outside to the power box and turn it back on.

But the young father was followed back inside by two masked men, one of which was armed with a handgun, while another man stood guard outside.   

Speaking to Nine News, Mr Aukuso said he and his family were 'really scared' that the men were going to shoot them. 

'I felt it, there was someone watching me. When I came back in, those two guys, big guys, they enter the house and almost laid hands on me,' he said. 

'It was really scary, my wife was screaming, my kids were too. 

'They were about do do it, maybe they were about to shoot us. I saw him looking at my kids, then they looked at me and then they suddenly stopped like that. 

'He said 'Sorry uce, wrong house' and then I saw him putting away a gun. I don't if it was a gun or a knife but I think it was a handgun, he put it back in his back pocket before he said that.' 

Uce is short for uso, which is a Samoan word for brother or sister, depending on gender. In this case, it meant brother.

After realising their mistake and apologising, the men drove off in a Toyota hatchback.  

No one in the Aukoso family was injured and no property was taken. 

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Tickner from Mount Druitt Police believes the home invaders were after the previous tenants, who may have been drug dealers.

'Upon realising the people in the house didn't appear to be the people they were looking for they apologised and left the scene,' Mr Tickner said. 

'Unfortunately, the people in the house prior to these people appear to be involved in some kind of drug activity.'

The previous tenants of the house moved out more than a year ago.
