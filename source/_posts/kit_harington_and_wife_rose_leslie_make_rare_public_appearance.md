Kit Harington and his wife Rose Leslie made a rare appearance in London on Friday, after spending much of 2020 away from the spotlight.

The couple, both aged 33, cut a low-key figure as they walked their Whippet dog through the streets of the capital, while wrapped up against the cold in their first sighting since they were seen at the Golden Globes in January. 

Their outing comes just days after Kit revealed he was brought up in a 'gender fluid' environment in his childhood and feels many men have an emotional 'blockage'.

Rose was wrapped up warm as she headed out in a thick cream jumper with a navy overcoat while she wore her hair in loose lengths.  

She paired the ensemble with superstar-worthy Gucci trainers. 

Kit was dashing as ever, wore a bomber jacket, a black polo neck, jeans and thick rim glasses, to give off a stylish off-duty vibe. 

The actor has mostly kept out of the spotlight this year since he attended the Golden Globes with his wife Rose. The couple keep their marriage private and prior to the event hadn't been snapped together for more than six months.

The former co-stars tied the knot in 2018. 

Kit portrayed Jon Snow on the HBO fantasy series for its entire run from 2011 to 2019 and won rave reviews for his performance. 

Earlier in the week, Kit told how he grew up idolising his mother, playwright Deborah Jane Catesby, who eschewed gender roles with him and his brother John.

Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: 'I asked for a Mighty Max and she bought me a Polly Pocket. I asked for an Action Man and I got a doll – it was very gender fluid from the word go. And I went with it.'

Out and about: The A-listers kept a low-profile 

The Game of Thrones star went on to say that he believes some men struggle with expressing their feelings because of attitudes passed down since World War II.

He said: 'I feel that emotionally men have a problem, a blockage, and that blockage has come from the Second World War, passed down from grandfather to father to son. 

'We do not speak about how we feel because it shows weakness, because it is not masculine. Having portrayed a man who was silent, who was heroic, I feel going forward that is a role I don’t want to play any more.'

Kit, who played Jon Snow on Game of Thrones, added that he does not think the world needs to see more of a 'masculine role'.
