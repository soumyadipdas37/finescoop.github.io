She was recently announced as one of the 12 contestants taking part in the upcoming series of Strictly Come Dancing.

And ahead of her debut on the dance floor, EastEnders star Maisie Smith showed her love for the environment as she and her pals spent the day picking up rubbish in their neighbourhood.

The 19-year-old actress, who plays Tiffany Butcher in the BBC soap, documented their good deed on Instagram on Friday, with the trio rapping and dancing while holding aloft bags of litter. 

Good deed: EastEnders star Maisie Smith showed her love for the environment as she and her pals spent the day picking up rubbish in their neighbourhood

Filming their efforts, Maisie revealed that the group had already filled two whole bags of rubbish during a walk around their local area.

She then called on her fans to do the same as she exclaimed 'pick up your rubbish!'

Clearly happy with their services to the community, the teenager and her friends then proceeded to dance and rap as they larked around in the park.

Altering the lyrics to the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air theme tune, they rapped: 'A couple of girls, they were up to some good, picking up the rubbish in the neighbourhood.'

They then fell about in giggles as they struggled with the rest of the words.

Maisie's good deed and her signing to Strictly comes despite her being under investigation for smoking a 'strong-smelling cigarette'. 

The actress was at the centre of controversy over the summer, when she was spotted smoking at the cigarette at the wheel of her car.   

A source told The Sun: 'It is unthinkable that Strictly would sign her after the few weeks she has had. The show is the pinnacle of the BBC and gives rising stars and established ones a huge step to more fame.

Well done: Filming their efforts, Maisie revealed that the group had already filled two whole bags of rubbish during a walk around their local area

Do your bit: She then called on her fans to do the same as she exclaimed 'pick up your rubbish!'

'So it’s very weird to give someone whose future was very unclear just weeks ago such an opportunity. Perhaps they see it as a way of nailing down a rising star rather than her leaving and taking with her a young audience.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Maisie and Strictly Come Dancing for comment at the time.

The report comes weeks after it was revealed that Maisie is being investigated by BBC bosses after she was spotted smoking the cigarette in question.

The Sun has reported that bosses were 'angry' and 'extremely disappointed' after Maisie was caught smoking a hand-rolled cigarette, after pulling over on an empty road in Essex on Sunday July 19.

Hilarious: They then fell about in giggles as they struggled with the rest of the words

The actress has also reportedly ruffled feathers after signing a big money TikTok deal, despite being told not to by soap chiefs.

Maisie apparently violated the terms of her EastEnders contract by inking a deal to promote musicians on the app. 

The teen previously allegedly turned down an eye-watering amount of money from a record label to promote their artists' music on her videos. 

She reportedly rejected the offer after being told it would breach her EastEnders contract, however she is believed to have gone on to accept a second deal.

An EastEnders spokeswoman confirmed to the publication: 'We are looking into this matter.' 

Meanwhile, the star reportedly turned down a record deal - which promised to make her 'the next Kylie Minogue' - so that she could take part on Strictly Come Dancing this year. 

The talented singer  is said to have been told by BBC bosses that the singing career would need to be put on hold if she wanted to remain on EastEnders and take part in Strictly.

Not impressed: Maisie, who plays Tiffany Butcher in the soap, has apparently violated the terms of her EastEnders contract by inking a deal to promote musicians on Tik Tok

A source told The Sun: 'Maisie wants to crack the music industry and several labels think she is really marketable. One told her she could be the next Kylie, with her girl-next-door looks and down-to-earth personality. 

'But she was told she could not take a record deal and continue on EastEnders and Strictly due to the BBC’s commercial rules.

'Maisie decided to take Strictly over the deal because she can revisit music after the show. This will give her an even bigger platform than EastEnders to show off her talents. She hopes it will be a huge chance for her.'
