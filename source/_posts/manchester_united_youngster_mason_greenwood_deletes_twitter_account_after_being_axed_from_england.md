Mason Greenwood has deleted his Twitter account following the aftermath of his exile from the England national team. 

The Manchester United forward, along with Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden, are at the centre of the latest England scandal after breaching Covid-19 protocols during their stay in Iceland with Gareth Southgate's squad. 

The FA are currently investigating the pair after they sneaked in two Icelandic girls, one a beauty queen, into their team hotel, breaking both Icelandic law and the FA's social distancing guidelines with people outside their bubble.

He and Man City midfielder Phil Foden have been sent home for breaking covid-19 protocol

Greenwood, who enjoyed a fantastic breakthrough season at Old Trafford last term, has now removed himself from Twitter following the backlash from the incident which saw both players sent home back to England.

Himself and Foden will miss the Three Lions' Nations League match with Denmark after both making appearances in the 1-0 victory over Iceland.

Ahead of the new season, Greenwood had been awarded the No 11 jersey at Manchester united but has since been reprimanded by his club for his actions on international duty.

A statement from the Red Devils said: 'Manchester United are liaising with the Football Association and are disappointed with the actions of Mason Greenwood over this situation.' 

The United youngster has remained silent following the removal of his Twitter presence, whilst Phil Foden has responded to the incident earlier on Monday.

Writing via Twitter on Monday evening, Foden said: 'Following the story which has emerged today regarding my actions in Iceland, I want to make a full apology.

Foden took to social media on Monday evening to issue a full apology to everybody involved

'I apologise to Gareth Southgate, to my England team mates, to the staff, supporters, and also to my Club and family.

'I am a young player with a lot to learn, but I am aware of the huge responsibility I have in representing Manchester City and England at this level.

'On this occasion I made a poor decision and my behaviour didn't meet the standards expected of me.

'I breached COVID-19 protocols put in place to protect myself and my England colleagues. As a consequence I will now miss the opportunity to travel to Denmark with the squad, and that hurts.'
