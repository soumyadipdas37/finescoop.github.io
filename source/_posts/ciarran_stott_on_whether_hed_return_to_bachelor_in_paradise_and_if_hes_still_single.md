Ciarran Stott invited his fans to ask him questions on Monday night, and the answers were revealing. 

The Bachelor in Paradise star held a Q+A session on Instagram Stories and was quizzed on several topics - including whether he would return to the show. 

The 25-year-old was very blunt in insisting he will never set foot in Paradise ever again - at least, not the local version.

'The Australian one – not a f**king chance!' he declared, adding with a wry expression, 'Never again. No.'

The British-born ladies man was also asked if he was single - and he admitted it was the most asked inquiry of the night. 

'It's like every scone one, who's your girlfriend, are you single!' he complained of the questions.

Earlier this month, he set tongues wagging once again, after being spotted cosying up to Big Brother star, Talia Rycroft, 22, in an Instagram video.

'Everyone is asking! I don't have girlfriend and yes I am single. Single!' Ciarran stated definitively.

According to The Wash Online earlier this month, the English export has lost on average 353 followers a day.  

Ciarran swatted fake tears from his eyes and joked, 'Oh it's terrible!' while pretending to sob. 

Then he added seriously: 'It is what it is. If you don't want to follow me don't follow me. Doesn't really bother me'.
