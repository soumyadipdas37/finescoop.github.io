While Irena kept quiet, Bella dominated the conversation with Locky's mother. She told cameras: 'I get nervous when I'm put on the spot and I talk a lot. I'm just nervous to make a good impression.'

At the table, she tells Brenda: 'It's kind of a weird situation because Irena and I aren't really good friends anymore.'
