Vicky Pattison has urged women not to compare their figures to other in a post about her own fitness journey.  

The former Geordie Shore star, 32, took to Instagram to mark the UK's National Fitness Day with a selection of photographs from her own quest for optimal health and the 'perfect' body over the years. 

Alongside snaps dating as far back as 2013, she penned: 'Happy National Fitness Day! To celebrate here are some photos of my own personal health and fitness journey from over the years.

'Keeping fit for me used to be all about achieving a particular aesthetic- in a word, it used to be all about being thin. I thought if I could be as small as possible I’d be fit, healthy and happy. But as you can see by these pictures: That wasn’t the case at all.'

The candid post was praised by fans who said they appreciated her honesty.

Vicky admitted that she used to be obsessed with being thin and thought achieving her desired body size would make her happy. Pictured: Vicky in 2013

Vicky said she has learned fitness isn't about an ideal body shape but instead showing respect for yourself. Pictured: Vicky in 2017

Vicky who boasts almost 5 million followers on Instagram, explained that fitness is no longer about achieving her dream body shape. 

She continued: 'Fitness and health aren’t about a size, a shape or a number! It’s about getting moving, it’s about respecting yourself and your body, it’s about that release of endorphins coursing through your body! 

'Exercise should be a celebration of what your body can do- not a punishment for what you’ve eaten and sometimes we forget that.

'We need to remember that health looks different on everyone and just because you aren’t a size 0 with a six pack doesn’t mean you aren’t fit & well! You can be a size 12, be super strong and resilient, train all the time, love yoga, get 8 hours a night, give birth to avocados, love the woman you’re becoming & still have a wobbly butt! 

'Similarly you can be a size 6 and have never set foot inside a gym, eat chips all the time, barely sleep & be wracked with anxiety! Please please PLEASE ladies: do not confuse ‘thin’ with ‘healthy.’ 

'Also do not covet another woman’s shape or worse criticism them. Slim or curvy- sometimes it just the way we are made and quite frankly I believe that variety is the spice of life anyway.'

Vicky urged her almost 5 million followers to stop coveting another woman's body shape, regardless if they're slim or curvy

She went on to add that women shouldn't spend their time focused on following strict exercise regimes.  

Vicky said: 'Everyone’s bodies are different and there are so many determining factors- genetics, height, natural shape to name but a few! So do not spend too much time comparing yourself to others and training to extremes in a desperate pursuit of perfection- train to be strong, to be happy, to be healthy and anything else that comes along with it... Is just a bonus.

'We are all fabulously flawed and beautiful in our own way remember that!! So on today,

'I encourage you beautiful lot to be more like the lass in the second half of these photos! I’d describe my body type as likes to workout but never says no to a cookie. And honestly, I’ve never been happier or healthier! Find something you love, that is good for you and do more of that!' 

Vicky who in 2013 went from a size 16 to a size six within just a few months, has been a victim of body shaming in the past.

Having consistently shared her workouts, the star became an ambassador of WW earlier this year in the hopes of embracing a healthy lifestyle.  

Vicky's latest post struck a chord with many of her followers who've struggled with their body image and racked up almost 100,000 likes. 

One person wrote: 'This is so inspiring and such a healthier view of health and fitness to what you normally see online. Feeds my soul'

'You're now a great role model to women well done! In those first photos you look so sad,' another said.

A third added: 'You look so much happier now. I'm pregnant at the moment and for the first time in my life I actually love my body. I regret wasting so much time over the years wishing I was that little bit thinner. Gimmie all the burgers'
