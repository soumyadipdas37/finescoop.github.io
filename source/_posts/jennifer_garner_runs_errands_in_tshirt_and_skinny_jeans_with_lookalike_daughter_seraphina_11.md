She's been focusing on her children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

And on Monday, Jennifer Garner was spotted running some errands in Beverly Hills with middle child Seraphina.

The actress, 48, and her 11-year-old daughter both made sure to wear disposable face masks on their outing as a precaution against spreading the coronavirus.

Garner showed off her workout-honed figure in a gray t-shirt and blue skinny jeans.

Her long hair was loose and she sported black-framed sunglasses.

Seraphina also left her long locks loose and wore sunglasses and she was dressed in a stripy blue shirt with black pants and cardigan.

Garner shares Seraphina, plus daughter Violet, 14, and son Samuel, eight, with her ex-husband Ben Affleck.

The couple split in 2015 after a decade of marriage but didn't finalize their divorce until 2018.

Affleck has since struck up a relationship with his Deep Water co-star Ana De Armas, who has been introduced to the children. 

Meanwhile, it's been reported that Garner's relationship with businessman John Miller is over.
