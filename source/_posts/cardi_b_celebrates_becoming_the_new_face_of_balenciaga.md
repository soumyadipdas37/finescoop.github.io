Cardi B is the new face of luxury fashion house Balenciaga.

The rapper, 27, posted her ultra-glamorous campaign onto her Instagram account, which sees her lying beside an assortment of toys in an exquisite midnight blue gown. 

The new Balenciaga campaign is currently being advertised at the Louvre Museum in Paris, along the banks of the Seine River.

'Ya lookin at the face of a @Balenciaga campaign! I remember how I felt seeing myself on a billboard in NYC Times Square but PARIS! Wish I was there to see it in person!' she captioned the snapshot.

In the high-fashion ad, Cardi lays in a playground littered with yellow toys alongside a chic white Balenciaga bag.

This is certainly not Cardi's first foray into fashion.

The style-conscious star previously collaborated with Fashion Nova to create her own collection for the online fashion store.

Earlier this year, Cardi also teamed up with Fashion Nova to help her fans amid the coronavirus crisis.

The WAP hitmaker and the retailer announced plans to donate $1 million to those in need during the pandemic, with the money being spread out in $1,000 instalments.

In a video, Cardi explained: 'You know sometimes you give to charity and you wonder, 'Is it really going to the people?' Well we're gonna make sure it goes to the people.'

In the caption, she wrote: 'I teamed up with them to help those that have been impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic. Many of you are struggling to pay bills, feed your families, and take care of your overall essential needs. (sic)'

To apply for the scheme, Cardi's followers needed to submit their applications by writing a 250-word personal narrative explaining how the virus changed their lives.

Richard Saghian, the Fashion Nova founder and CEO, said at the time: 'People are struggling to pay rent, buy food, medicine and other essentials for themselves and their families. We all feel compassion and concern for those affected by the coronavirus.'
