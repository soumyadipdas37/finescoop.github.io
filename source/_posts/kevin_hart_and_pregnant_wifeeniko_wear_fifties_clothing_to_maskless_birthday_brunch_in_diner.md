Comedian Kevin Hart and his pregnant second wife Eniko Parrish got dressed up in 1950s clothing to attend a brunch celebrating the 49th birthday of Harry Ratchford at a rented diner in Los Angeles on Sunday.

The 41-year-old Grammy nominee did his best Danny Zuko or Fonzie greaser style in a white undershirt, cuffed blue jeans, Converse sneakers, and black leather motorcycle jacket.

The expecting 36-year-old wore a floral maternity dotted frock, saddle shoes, neckerchief, and cat-eye shades.

'Old-school Sundays, Your name is Wilma or Thea or Thelma,' Kevin - who boasts 185.8M social media followers - instructed Eniko.

'My name is Troy the Tavern Tank. That's what they call me, baby. We old-schooling it today.'

Hart pretended to smoke an unlit Marlboro Light as he danced with Parrish - who will soon welcome his fourth child (her second), a daughter, whom they call '#BabyK.'

The Celebrity Game Face host is keeping the Fabletics brand ambassador close during this pregnancy as he publicly admitted to having cheated on her the last time she was expecting in 2017.

Kevin was 'fully in character' as he jammed to the jukebox and enjoyed classic diner fare at the party from masked employees.

Worryingly, none of the costumed guests - including the married couple of four years - protected themselves or others from the coronavirus by wearing masks or social distancing.

Indoor dining is currently prohibited in all Los Angeles restaurants, and even private gatherings can only contain up to 50 people.

As of Sunday, there have been over 260K confirmed COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 6,353 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University.
