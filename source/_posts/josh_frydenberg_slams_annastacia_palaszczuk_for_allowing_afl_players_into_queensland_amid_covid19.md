Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has criticised Annastacia Palaszczuk's major coup in securing the AFL grand final, accusing her of favouring sporting stars over desperate families needing to cross the border for medical reasons.

The Queensland Premier proudly announced that she'd secured the landmark match on Tuesday alongside AFL CEO Gil McLachlan, who was granted an exemption to fly in to the Sunshine State for the announcement.

The Gabba in Brisbane was awarded AFL's showpiece event over Perth's Optus Stadium and the Adelaide Oval on Wednesday. 

But Mr Frydenberg, along with hordes of others, have argued the celebrations were insensitive to families who had been barred from entering Queensland.

'I think the Queensland Premier has got some questions to answer here,' he told A Current Affair on Wednesday night. 

'How can it be okay for people to go up to prepare for a footy game, and its not okay to go to hospital for treatment?'

Mr Frydenberg referenced several tragic examples of New South Wales locals not receiving access to the Sunshine State during the pandemic.

'How can it be okay that a young woman loses an unborn child because of border confusion... that a four-year-old boy with cancer can be separated from his mother?

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has criticised Annastacia Palaszczuk's major coup in securing the AFL grand final, accusing her of favouring sporting stars over desperate families needing to cross the border for medical reasons

'These are cruel and confused implications from these strict border approaches... I think everyone needs to get a grip here and remember that we're first and last Australians.'    

But Ms Palaszczuk insisted it was a 'huge win' for Queenslanders, who have hosted more sporting games during the pandemic due to the state's successful handing of the COVID-19 crisis. 

October 24, 2020 will mark the first time in the leagues 124 year history that the decider has been played outside of Melbourne.

The event will be a major boost for Queensland's ailing tourism and events sector, which has been crippled alongside the rest of the nation due to draconian lockdown orders and the virus itself. 

But the huge influx of AFL officials, players and WAGS gave rise to claims of double standards, given the pain the state's draconian border restrictions are inflicting upon average people.  

Campbell Newman, the state's former LNP premier, tweeted: 'So if you are AFL royalty you can get into Queensland, with your family, but if you live in northern NSW with your seriously ill child you can't!

'Nothing demonstrates more starkly the politically cynical and elitist reality of Annastacia (Palaszczuk) and Dr Young's restrictions.'   

Before AFL bigwigs flew in, Kimberley Brown (pictured), from Ballina, in northern New South Wales, was unable to travel to Queensland for urgent surgery- and lost an unborn twin when NSW Health authorities told her to fly to Sydney instead

The AFL officials will still need to undergo the mandatory two week hotel-quarantine after flying into the state.

But the criticism erupted after a couple in Ballina, in northern NSW, expecting twins were told it would take too long to get an exemption to enter Queensland for emergency surgery. Local health officials told them to fly to Sydney instead.

Kimberley Brown was unable to obtain a travel exemption for urgent surgery in Queensland so instead was forced to fly to Sydney with a 16 hour wait.

Her unborn twins had developed twin transfusion syndrome - a disorder that leads to malnourishment and organ failure in one of the babies. 

Ms Brown lived just two hours from Queensland's Mater Hospital but instead had to wait 16 hours for an emergency flight and travel 750km to Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

An ultrasound later showed Ms Brown had lost one of the babies.

NSW Health has confirmed it had advised Ms Brown to travel to Sydney, rather than Queensland. 

Queensland Health insists it did not receive a request to send Ms Brown to Brisbane for emergency surgery. 

Deputy NSW Premier John Barilaro piled on Ms Palaszczuk on breakfast television on Wednesday. 

Mr Barilaro said it's hypocritical for Queensland to close its borders over concerns about COVID-19 in NSW, and yet let in hundreds of AFL officials, players and their families from the virus hotspot of Victoria.  

 Is it fair the AFL can fly into Queensland in their hundreds - while family, friends and the sick struggle to get over the border or are blocked?

'Four hundred AFL officials from coronavirus central will go across the border into Queensland yet a young family can't get emergency healthcare across the border,' he said.

'I think Annastacia Palaszczuk continues to show politics trumps good policy and I think she is undoing all her good work.'  

Just two new COVID-19 cases were recorded in Queensland in the 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday, with the number of active cases in an existing cluster remaining at 28.

NSW reported 17 new cases on Wednesday and Victoria, in Stage Four lockdown, 90 cases.

Victoria: Completely open, but other states are banning residents from going there

NSW: Border with Victoria is closed but others are open without restriction

Queensland: Open to everywhere but Victoria, NSW, and the ACT

Northern Territory: Open to everywhere but Victoria and Sydney, which must do hotel quarantine

South Australia: Closed to Victoria, NSW arrivals must self-isolate, rest are open

Tasmania: Closed to Victoria, everywhere else must do hotel quarantine

Western Australia: Closed to everywhere without an exemption 

Mr Barilaro argued the border closure is hurting NSW residents who need healthcare in Queensland. 

'I don't get it. I don't understand why the premier of Queensland can't see it. Show some heart.

'Show some ability to understand the impact this is having and understand that that Queensland border is a seamless border.' 

Ms Palaszczuk today brushed off the criticisms. 

She said winning the rights to host the grand final were an endorsement of her government's response to COVID-19. 

'This is a historic day - it's a historic day for the AFL, it's a historic day for Queensland,' she said.

'I do want to pay a special shoutout to all Queenslanders, who have done a great job especially as we've battled COVID as well.

'If it wasn't for that strong health response and the fact that every Queenslander has been part of that this would not have happened, so this is a win for Queensland as well.'

Quizzed about the healthcare border issue , Ms Palaszczuk said NSW residents requiring specialist treatment would have a streamlined process to apply for medical exemptions by the end of the week. 

Under the rules, NSW emergency patients are allowed to enter Queensland. 

Mr McLachlan's own press conference announcing the move was livestreamed from a hotel where he will serve out his quarantine period. 

Meanwhile, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian today hit out at Queensland's leader for her ongoing restrictions, saying she needs to show 'a bit of compassion'.

Ms Berejiklian's poor relationship with Ms Palaszczuk is an open secret and even she admitted it was fraught to Ben Fordham Live on 2GB on Wednesday morning.

'I've tried to establish a positive relationship, but it's a bit difficult when decisions are made without even telling us,' Ms Berejiklian said.

'Can I compare that to Dan Andrews and the Prime Minister? The three of us worked together on a very difficult decision about the Victorian and NSW border, and I would like to see that applied to all borders.

'I think that at this stage of the pandemic all of us should be thinking about how we can make life easier for our citizens, what we can do rather than what we can't do and that is certainly the head space we are in NSW.'

Queensland Liberal Senator Matt Canavan has also slammed the premier, saying Ms Palaszczuk is playing a 'political state of origin'.

'We have a pandemic and why is the Queensland Premier putting so much effort into a football game when she hasn't been able to give adequate health services to people?' Mr Canavan told the Today Show.

'We have had the tragic circumstance in the last week where someone may have lost a child because of the inefficiencies in the border controls, and Annastacia Palaszczuk is out there playing some kind of political State of Origin with this crisis rather than focusing on the real issue.

'Fix the community transmission in Brisbane, fix our borders.' 

Just two new cases of COVID_19 were recorded in Queensland in the 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday with the number of active cases in an existing cluster remaining at 28.

The current outbreak in the state's southeast is centred on the Corrective Services Academy at Wacol, southwest of Brisbane.

Ms Palaszczuk today rejected a question about whether she was proposing to 'pack the Gabba' while there was a 'significant spread' of the virus in southeast Queensland.

'But there isn't (a significant spread), there isn't. It's contained,' she said.

'No there is not, that's not correct. That's not correct - I reject the premise of your question.'  

The Queensland government will review the border closure at the end of this month.

The state's deputy police commissioner Steve Gollschewski said that since March, nearly 660,000 vehicles had been checked at the state borders and 290,000 incoming plane passengers had been screened.  

The premier said 18,000 tests had been conducted in 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday, more than double the 7480 in the previous 24 hours.

She also said stage four lockdowns will maintained in state prisons after a riot at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre, southwest of Brisbane, on Tuesday night.

'These measures are no different to the quarantine measures that have had to be put in place to keep everyone safe,' Ms Palaszczuk said.
