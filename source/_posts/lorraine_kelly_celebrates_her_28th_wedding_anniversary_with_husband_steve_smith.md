Lorraine Kelly looked on cloud nine as she shared a rare glimpse of her husband Steve Smith as they celebrated their 28th anniversary together.

The couple, who tied the knot in 1992, were treated to afternoon tea at The Ivy restaurant by their daughter Rosie, with Lorraine, 60, sharing a snap on Instagram.

The pair were all smiles as they both held up desserts with 'Happy Anniversary' written alongside it as their nearest and dearest sent their well wishes.

Lorraine wrote: 'A lovely lunch as a present from @rosiekellysmith at #theivymarlowgarden to celebrate our anniversary. Just perfect xxxx'.

The chat show also shared a photo of the couple taken on their wedding day as they left the church after saying 'I do'. 

Lorraine wrote: 'So this happened 28 years ago! Happy anniversary to my husband Steve who makes me laugh and is always in my corner. #anniversary #love #happy'.

The ITV star occasionally shares snaps of herself alongside Steve, who is a TV cameraman, to her Instagram but their relationship has mostly been out of the public eye.

The couple's daughter Rosie, who was born in 1994, also shared a throwback photo of her parents as she marked their special day.

Alongside a photo of the pair standing in a sunny location with their arms wrapped around each other, she wrote: 'My faves, Happy Anniversary'.

Rosie had been living in Singapore but returned home in recent months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Lorraine recently spoke to her daughter on Good Morning Britain in a pre-recorded segment, with Rosie explaining she 'used her common sense' and self-isolated for two weeks after returning home.

Rosie told her mum that despite the worldwide pandemic there were no medical checks when she touched down in the UK, with the only difference being there were just 16 people on her flight.  

She then went onto explain why she chose to self-isolate from her family for 14 days after flying home.

She said: 'At least two weeks, I didn't feel comfortable getting off a flight and coming straight home... I just got a leaflet, an NHS leaflet, it said if you think you have any symptoms then stay home.'
