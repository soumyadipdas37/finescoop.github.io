It's very rarely that all three judges on The Block are blown away by a room reveal.

But that was the case on Sunday's episode, when Darren Palmer, Neale Whitaker and Shaynna Blaze laid their eyes on Luke and Jasmin's 1910 master bathroom.

Darren could not hide his delight at specific details of the space, particularly the curved tile walls and skylight.   

'I'm just blown away!' The Block judge Darren Palmer (pictured) was momentarily lost for words over Luke and Jasmin's master bathroom on Sunday night's episode 

'I'm in love, it's so elegant, so pretty,' Darren said of the skylight. 'I'm just blown away by how beautiful that is.' 

Neale and Shaynna were equally blown away, with Neale describing the aesthetic as 'exceptional'.

'This is exceptional. They have given us a very, very modern bathroom, but I think they have remained faithful to those period cues they introduced last week,' he said.

Praise: Fellow judges Neale Whitaker and Shaynna Blaze were equally blown away with the space, with Neale describing the aesthetic as 'exceptional' 

The only minor faults the judges found were the lack of a toilet roll holder and the vanity being too close to the shower wall. 

For Harry and Tash's 1920's master ensuite, the judges were in awe of the green tiled wall and feature bath.

Neale said it felt like a contemporary bathroom, but with definite references to the era, while Darren described the space as 'glorious' with 'perfect' floor tiles.

Shaynna commended the couple for seamlessly using four different tiles in the room, while Neale said the space offered an exceptional level of sophistication.  

For Daniel and Jade's 1930's master ensuite, all three judges were captivated by the choice of fish scale tiles on the walls. 

Darren also found delight in the couple going with a matte grey tile on the floor, teamed with a 'sexy' gloss finish on the walls.

Jimmy and Tam's 1950's master ensuite boasted pink tones in the choice of wall tile, basins and luxe accessories. 

Shaynna described the colour palette as 'divine' and the vanity as 'streamlined and stunning'.

Darren noted the consistent detail, particularly with the wood panelling in both the master bedroom and master ensuite.

The only faults were the lack of lighting above the vanity. 

Luke and Jasmin tied in first place with Jimmy and Tam on 29 points, followed by another tie between Harry and Tash, and Sarah and George, on 28-and-a-half.

Daniel and Jade finished third on 28 points. 

The Block continues Monday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine.
