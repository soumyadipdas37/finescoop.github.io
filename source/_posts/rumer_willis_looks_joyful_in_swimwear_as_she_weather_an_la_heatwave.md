Representatives for Hammer and Willis did not immediately calls for comment. 

The outing comes just weeks after Armie and his ex Elizabeth announced they were going their separate ways following 10 years of marriage and two children together.

Armie posted a photo of him and Elizabeth in happier times, and wrote: 'Thirteen years as best friends, soulmates, partners and then parents. It has been an incredible journey, but together, we've decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage.

'As we enter into this next chapter, our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority.

'We understand this news lends itself to public dialogue, but in the interest of our children and our family, we're asking for privacy, compassion and love during this time.'

Armie and Elizabeth wed in 2010, and welcomed daughter Harper, five, and son Ford, three.

Rumer, meanwhile, was previously linked to actor Ricky Whittle in 2014. She was also reportedly 'infatuated' with her 2015 Dancing With The Stars partner Val Chmerkovskiy, even allegedly getting a tattoo commemorating their partnership.

But the tattoo was reportedly removed after Val began dating DWTS star Jenna Johnson, whom he ultimately married.
