It was one of the most tense finales The Bachelor has ever seen, as Locky Gilbert claimed he was in love with both finalists before making his choice on Thursday.

But ultimately, it was Bella Varelis who had her heart broken in the tense final scenes - leading the 25-year-old to storm off upon hearing the news.

Locky burst into tears and gasped for air as he delivered the news to Bella, who looked visibly shocked as he dumped in front of him as he dumped her in front of the nation - saying he needed 'more certainty' in a relationship.

Tears: Locky broke down as he told Bella the tragic news

'I fell in love with you the first day I saw you, and I saw those big brown eyes,' he said in an emotion-filled speech.

'Like, they just make me go crazy. And, like, when I told you I love you, like, I meant every single word. 

'I know you  don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty.' 

Heartbroken: Bella was left devastated with the blow

Upon hearing the news, Bella looked at the man - who had declared his love for her a day earlier - in complete disbelief. 

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added.

 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me,' she said in shock. 

After he responded by saying he was in love with her, Bella added: 'Well, why not follow through with a relationship, then?' 

He went on: 'Because I asked you in the pool - what do you see our next year looking like? And you were so... I needed a little bit more.'

 Furiously, she responded: 'You can't turn this around on me.'

She then stormed off, stating: 'My God... Can I leave. I'm going.'
