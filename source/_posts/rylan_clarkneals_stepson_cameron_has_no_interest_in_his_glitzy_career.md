Rylan Clark-Neal shared his pride for step-son Cameron a few weeks ago on Instagram, after the aspiring actor was accepted to prestigious drama school LAMDA.

The It Takes Two host, 31, typically keeps his private life away from the limelight, but broke this trend in July when Cameron, 20, got into the acting academy.

Rylan told MailOnline why he wanted to post about it - and insisted LAMDA didn't know that Cameron and he were family.

'I don’t share my private life or post about stuff at home,' Rylan told us. 'But I am proud of him so I wanted to post.

'And by the way, LAMDA had no idea I was his step-dad! It was nothing to do with me! Cameron got in entirely on his own merit. He worked so hard and it paid off.

'All I'm involved in is the dad side of things. Like "where are you going to live and how much is this going to cost me?"'

Rylan also pointed out that Cameron 'isn't fazed' by his step-dad's career.

Rylan said: 'By the way, LAMDA had no idea I was his step-dad! It was nothing to do with me! Cameron got in entirely on his own merit. He worked so hard and it paid off'

He met Cameron's father Dan after the latter was a contestant in a civilian series of Big Brother - for which Rylan was the host of sister show Bit On The Side.

They eventually married, with Rylan becoming a step-father as a result.

'Cameron takes the least interest in my career than anyone really,' Rylan went on. 'He is just not fazed. He meets famous people I know and he's just like, "hello!"'

'He is a really good actor. He did it in college and, anyone that has a 20-year-old will know, it can either go one way or the other. 

'Cameron auditioned, and put his head down. He was rehearsing every f**king day! I would hear it over and over. I could recite his audition piece word for word by the end of it.

'Then on the day people were finding out, my friend [presenter] Lucy Alexander's kid got in. And I was all, "God, Cameron's not in yet!" I was praying. He worked so hard for it!'

But all's well that ended well, with Rylan gushing over Cameron in July, sharing a snap of them both as they celebrated his success with a drink.

Alongside the photo, he wrote: 'Well I’m a proud one tonight. Our boy has been accepted to LAMDA !!! Completely overjoyed and so proud well done @cam.neal xxxxx'.

Rylan and Dan, 40, got engaged in September 2014 and married in November 2015 with stars including Eamon Holmes and Ruth Langsford, Amy Childs, Katie Price and Emma and Matt Willis in attendance.

In 2017, Cameron threw his support behind his dads by posing with them in a 'Come Out For LGBT' T-shirt for a pride campaign. 

Rylan added: 'All I'm involved in is the dad side of things. Like "where are you going to live and how much is this going to cost me?"'

Dan captioned the snap of the three of them: 'My son stands beside us in support of the #LGBT community. We all have a part to play, so #ComeOutForLGBT with us & @stonewalluk'

Stonewall’s campaign was implemented to encourage both gay and straight people to help make schools, homes and the workplace a safer place for LGBTQ+ people.

Rylan said of Cameron in a past interview: 'I look at him like he’s my own. He can talk to me – I’m Dad, but he can talk to me about sex! I’ll say, "As long as you’re being safe!" If that was Dan, he’d be like, "Stop it, Dad!"'

He also admitted he'd like to have children of his own one day, adding: 'I’m already a step-dad but, of course, I’d like to have kids. Since day one I’ve always wanted kids. I love babies.

'It’s always on the table, it’s just when the time is right. If I did have a baby, I’d be the sort to want a year off just to be a dad. There’s a lot that I’ve got to look at.'
