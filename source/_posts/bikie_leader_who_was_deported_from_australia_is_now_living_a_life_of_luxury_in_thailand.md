A bikie leader who was deported from Australia is now living the high life in a luxurious Thai mansion with his glamorous wife.   

Josef Armani Heart, once known as Joe Edwards, was sent back to New Zealand after his gang tried to start up a new chapter of the notorious Mongols Mob in Perth in 2017. 

The heavily-tattooed bikie boss now uses Instagram to boast about the new palatial home he shares with his wife and daughter near the beach destination Phuket.

A social media user congratulated the gang leader and said 'owning a house but in another country coming from the hood is inspiring'.

Heart replied: 'Mob life my brother.'

Mongrel Mob has dominated New Zealand's criminal scene since they sprouted up in 1962, with its members often distinguishing themselves with facial tattoos and wearing red.

Several Mongrel Mob chapters remained in Western Australia despite the deportations in 2017

The gang began recruiting members for Australian chapters in Perth, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Darwin from 2017 - the year Heart was caught at Perth Airport trying to bring gang uniforms into Western Australia. 

He was one of five gang members booted out of the state. 

His visa was cancelled on 'character grounds' and he was put on a plane home to New Zealand, before flying to Thailand to start a new life.
