An Australian chemical weapons expert who was tragically killed in a bomb blast in the Solomon Islands has been remembered by heartbroken friends as a 'modern day MacGyver' who risked his life to save others.

Australian Trent Lee, 40, and Briton Luke Atkinson, 57, died when an explosion ripped through a residential street in Honiara, the nation's capital, between 7.30pm and 8pm on Sunday.

Mr Lee was working as a bomb specialist for non-government organisation Norwegian People's Aid.

The organisation employed people to help remove undetonated explosives that had been littered across the Solomon Islands during World War II.

A close friend of the 40-year-old, Tony Bartlett, said he and his wife were now getting tattoos to remember their selfless mate.

Mr Lee had moved to the Solomon Islands 18 months ago with his partner and has been remembered as an extremely smart and selfless man

'He has got to be one of the smartest people in this world,' Mr Bartlett told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'This guy, he built his own cellular tower, his own generator. It's amazing what he could do for his community over there. He was a modern day MacGyver, there's nothing this man couldn't do.' 

Mr Bartlett said his friend even legally changed his middle name to 'danger' while getting his drivers licence in the Solomon Islands.

He said in the weeks before his death Mr Lee had removed up to 90 explosives.

'He would have saved thousands of lives. That was Trent,' Mr Bartlett said.

Mr Lee, who was originally from Newcastle, moved to the Islands 18 months ago with his wife Kathryn to build an eco-lodge.

During his time there he also worked as a chief chemist for a gold mine and taught locals how to build water supply systems.

In his younger years Mr Lee had been a champion mountain bike rider and his skills in cave diving scored him a spot on an Australian $1 stamp in 2017.

On the night of the explosion, residents rushed to the scene to see both men seriously injured.

Investigators are seen at the crime scene on Sunday night after the two men were killed 

Just a month before the fatal explosion, Mr Lee took to Facebook to talk about how dangerous his line of work was.

'Pretty much the most dangerous WW2 ammunition we find...it's cocked and ready to fire...one bump and it's all over,' he wrote on August 13. 

Sunday evening's bomb blast could be heard up to five kilometres away.  

Local police sealed off the blast area and launched an investigation.

A police statement said officers of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team and Forensics Department were at the scene.

The two men were conducting a non-technical survey on the contamination of unexploded ordnances in the Solomons, the police media statement said. 

The pair had been working to remove an explosive in Honiara when they were killed in the 'tragic accident' 

Inspector Clifford Tunuki said police spent the night clearing the explosion site. 

'Explosives ordinance disposal officers will have to render the scene safe before forensics and other investigators access the scene to find out what happened,' Inspector Tunuki told media. 

NPA deputy secretary-general Per Nergaard confirmed in a statement that Mr Lee and Mr Atkinson had died in the blast.

'This is a tragic accident. So far, we know that there has been an explosion with fatal consequences,' he said.

'Our main priority now is to offer assistance to relatives and colleagues and to clarify what has happened.

'The safety and security of our staff is our highest priority.'

NPA secretary-general Henriette Killi Westhrin said the organisation was devastated by the loss of two good colleagues.

'Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to their families, relatives and staff.'

The NPA has 1850 deminers working in 19 countries worldwide.

The organisation has since put all work removing explosives on hold while the deaths are investigated.

Thousands of unexploded devices remain on the Solomon Islands.
