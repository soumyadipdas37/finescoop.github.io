Denise Welch was the picture of confidence as she shared a stunning bikini image to her Instagram on Thursday morning.

The Loose Women panellist, 62, showcased her youthful-looking figure in a red two-piece for the photo taken from her recent sun-soaked getaway to Malta.

Detailing her health journey, the actress - who has been sober for eight years - revealed she once replaced her alcohol addiction with food, but has since managed to maintain her two-stone weight loss.

The former Coronation Street star cut a glamorous figure as she coordinated her swimwear with matching lipstick and nail polish, while complementing her appearance with metallic sandals.

Media personality Denise praised LighterLife for helping her embark on a healthier lifestyle seven years ago.

The TV star - who previously shed two stone in just two months - detailed in an accompanying caption: '7 yrs ago I joined @lighterlife as I’d put on over 2 stone after giving up alcohol.

'I realised I was on a slippery slope of replacing alcohol addiction with food addiction. I wanted a diet plan that would change my relationship with food not just help me lose the weight.

'@lighterlife was the only one using cognitive behavioural therapy alongside meal replacements (proven to be the best in the U.K. re vitamins, minerals required for daily intake). I lost 2st in 8 weeks and have kept it off ever since. 

'I use the flexifasting plan to feel healthier and to avoid gaining too much again. The osteoarthritis in my knees and back improved by 90% immediately and have never returned to where they were.'

The host added that she regularly catches up with doctors and dietary specialist who frequently advise the company. 

Denise ended her post: 'I have seen hundreds of lives changed for the better and type 2 diabetes reversed after people have reached their goal weight quickly and safely.

'I am thrilled that we are now seeing trials of this type of diet being held in the U.K. as we realise that obesity is one of the growing life threatening conditions in our country. 

'I am proud to be the ambassador and we need to acknowledge how important it is to look at why so many people emotionally eat and how food is to many what alcohol was to me. 

'Everyone deserves freedom from addiction especially now as anxiety and depression are on the increase #ad.' (sic)

In July, the thespian spoke about her battle with postnatal depression following the birth of her son Matt Healy, 31.

The Waterloo Road star revealed on Loose Women that she lost two stone in just four weeks as she was unable to eat anything in the month that followed the 1975's singer's birth in 1989.

Denise admitted at her lowest she tried to throw herself out of a taxi and the condition was her first experience of mental health issues. 

'I couldn't eat anything': In July, the media personality spoke about her battle with postnatal depression following the birth of her son Matt Healy, 31 (pictured in 2011) 

Speaking during the debate 'Were you birth body ready?', she told the panel: 'For me personally, there were some changes but I did lose all the weight because of course, another thing people don't talk enough about is the postnatal depression, which I had. 

'The physical side of what happened to me after the birth was totally irrelevant, I didn't even think about it. 

'Unfortunately, my illness meant I lost two stone in about four weeks because I couldn't eat anything. My mum had to give me meal replacements to try to keep that going. 

'As a result of that, I've had a natural birth, I've had a cesarean. So I've got the flabby tummy, I wet myself all the time, that did happen with that, so obviously I didn't do enough pelvic floor exercises. 

'And I got bigger boobs. I don't know why because I look at photos from before and I used to put Tim's socks down my bra to pad it out! 

'I don't know what the size was but I remember I went from having nothing to having these massive, well they're not massive... So there's a lot people don't tell you.'  

Denise released her book The Unwelcome Visitor: Depression And How I Survive It earlier this year, in which she speaks about her struggles - something she has been candid about for years.

Postnatal depression is a form of the mental-health condition that affects more than one in 10 women in the UK and US within a year of giving birth.

As many men can be affected as women, research suggests.  

Many parents feel down, teary and anxious within the first two weeks of having a child, which is often called the 'baby blues'.

But if symptoms start later or last longer, they may be suffering from postnatal depression.

Postnatal depression is just as serious as others form of the mental-health disorder. 

Symptoms include:

Sufferers should not wait for their symptoms to just go away.

Instead they should recognise that it is not their fault they are depressed and it does not make them a bad parent.

If you or your partner may be suffering, talk to your GP or health visitor.

Treatments can include self-help, such as talking to loved ones, resting when you can and making time to do things you enjoy. Therapy may also be prescribed. 

In severe cases where other options have not helped, antidepressants may be recommended. Doctors will prescribe ones that are safe to take while breastfeeding.

Postnatal depression's cause is unclear, however, it is more common in those with a history of mental-health problems. 

Lack of support from loved ones, a poor relationship with the partner and a life-changing event, such as bereavement, can also raise the risk.
