You can add the name of Tariq Lamptey to that of Mo Salah and Kevin de Bruyne. The Ones That Got Away, you might say.

For had Chelsea boss Frank Lampard found himself in front of a television in the hours before Sunday’s visit of Liverpool, it would have made for rueful viewing. How on earth did he sanction the teenager’s sale? And for £3million, no less.

Much has been made of Chelsea letting go of Salah and De Bruyne, two future PFA Player of the Year winners. It could be that Lamptey joins that list one day, too.

Lampard must really fancy Chelsea right-back Reece James, for Lamptey, at 19 and making just his 11th Premier League appearance, has the world at his feet.

Against Newcastle he invariably had the ball at his feet and black-and-white shirts in his wake. He retired hurt after 58 minutes - the hosts’ most accurate connections all game were with Lamptey’s ankles - but he could have walked off after eight minutes, job done.

By that point Brighton were two goals up against a clueless Newcastle, who seemingly had not watched Lamptey’s equally impressive performance against his old club Chelsea on Monday night.

If Steve Bruce and his staff had then they would not have tasked winger Allan Saint-Maximin with containing the front-running full-back. It felt like asking an unruly toddler to mind the gun, and as it was Newcastle shot themselves in the foot.

The French forward's second goal was initially ruled out for offside but was overturned by VAR

Lamptey had already served warning of his threat with one burst to the by-line when he then skipped into area and was toppled by the clumsy slide of Saint-Maximin on four minutes. Neal Maupay converted from the penalty spot.

Two minutes later and Lamptey was again charging forward unopposed, this time slipping a pass to Leandro Trossard and he centred for Maupay to clip home. The goal was flagged for offside but a VAR check arrived at the right decision.

Lamptey’s decision-making was equally sound and, just when it looked as if he had made a rash lunge in an attempt to thwart Callum Wilson as he ran clear on goal, the ball was scooped from the striker’s stride. It was phenomenal stuff.

Steve Bruce looked on as his Newcastle side failed to deal with Lamptey's Brighton

It took 20 minutes of Saint-Maximin being denied at one end and destroyed at the other before he switched flanks. Come the 33rd minute and the Frenchman was signalling to the bench that he’d had enough. 

It felt telling that, as he limped past the dugout and off down the tunnel, Bruce and his coaching staff stood motionless. Such inertia was reflective of how their team had played.

The government have advised against needless journeys this week. Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan travelled 350 miles to Tyneside for absolutely no reason.

Newcastle failed to register a shot on target for the whole match in a dismal home display

Where Graham Potter’s Brighton had a clear identity, game-plan and the ability to execute it, Newcastle had no shots on target and no ideas. They did have lots of fouls, however.

The visitors netted a deserved third seven minutes from time when the excellent Maupay fed Aaron Connolly and he curled into the far corner from 12 yards. It was all too easy.

Maupay and Trossard had earlier smacked the woodwork, while Wilson headed over when unmarked from six yards. But that was a rare sight at goal.

The game did end on a sour note for Brighton when Yves Bissouma was rightly sent off for a high boot in the face of Jamal Lewis. But the result was never doubt. In fact, it hadn’t been for the best part of 80 minutes.

Brighton are now unbeaten in eight matches away from home, the current best record in the Premier League.

In the form of Lamptey they have the league’s best right-back, too. And that says something given the competition.

Just what were Chelsea thinking?

Host commentator

That's all we've got time for on the live blog today. But the action is just about to begin in the Premier League as Chelsea host Liverpool in around 15 minutes time.

All the reaction to Brighton's win is on its way on the Sportsmail website as well as live coverage of the big game at Stamford Bridge.

Have a good evening!

Tariq Lamptey was given man of the match by Sky Sports and it was well deserved.

In the hour of football he played, he shown defensive astuteness and a willingness to affect matters at the top end of the pitch. A brilliant showing from the youngster.

All over at St James' Park. It was a training game for Brighton who controlled the match from start to finish.

Neal Maupay's early double gave Graham Potter's side a brilliant start while Aaron Connolly put some gloss on the performance with a goal just four minutes from the end.

Newcastle were abject. Not a single effort on target from Steve Bruce's side. They must be grateful the fans were not in the stadium for this one.

90+1 mins: Brighton came forward looking for more. Trossard leads the break and feeds Jahanbakhsh but the substitute's strike is blocked.

90 mins: Brighton make their final change of the match. Ali Jahanbakhsh replaces goalscorer Aaron Connolly.

There will be THREE minutes added on at the end of the game - but the Seagulls are already home and dry. 

89 mins: Decision reversed. Yves Bissouma is off. It looks harsh, but the midfielder's leg was very very high.

88 mins: Hold on. VAR has told referee Kevin Friend to look at the monitor. The official is having a look.

87 mins: Yves Bissouma challenges Jamal Lewis in the air. The midfielder swings his leg high up in the air and Lewis is down.

The challenge warrants only a yellow card but the Newcastle defender is still receiving treatment on the deck.

84 mins: Game. Set. Match. Brighton deserve the points and it's a lovely goal to seal it.

Neal Maupay drops deep, turns then charges at the Newcastle defence. He then feeds Aaron Connolly who peeled away nicely to find some space and he curls a lovely effort into the far corner.

Graham Potter's side are home and dry and there's still five minutes to go.

80 mins: Ten minutes left and Newcastle still haven't tested Mat Ryan in the Brighton goal.

They've played different formations and several strikers but it's not working for them yet. The visitors look very comfortable.

78 mins: It's Adam Lallana time at St James' Park as the former Liverpool man comes on for Solly March.

72 mins: Last throw of the dice from Steve Bruce and it's an attacking switch.

Jonjo Shelvey is taken off and striker Joelinton is on. The big forward didn't score many last season. His side need a couple of goals this afternoon.

His job was nearly made even harder as Aaron Connolly fires a whisker over the bar for Brighton. 

71 mins: Brighton his the woodwork again - this time the flag stays down.

Leandro Trossard runs through the midfield and lets fly from 20 yards. The ball bounces past Karl Darlow but the left hand post denies Brighton a third goal.

That would have sealed the game.

69 mins: Brighton nearly have a third as Aaron Connoly runs through down the left. He cuts inside and the ball hits the outside of the post.

The flag does go up eventually and replays show the Irish striker was offside in the move.

63 mins: Big chance for Newcastle. Miguel Almiron continues his bright start to the game by charging down the left hand side. He crosses from Callum Wilson who rises unchallenged in the penalty area but the striker can only head over the bar. What a miss.

61 mins: Neal Maupay charges at the Newcastle goal looking for his hat-trick. He pushes the ball onto his left foot and curls an effort goalwards but it is straight down the throat of Karl Darlow. 

58 mins: Slight surprise here as Tariq Lamptey, who has been excellent today, is taken off for Dan Burn.

The youngster has gone straight down the tunnel which suggests he is injured. He picked up a knock making a goal-saving tackle on Callum Wilson in the first-half.

52 mins: Newcastle have started this half brightly and Miguel Almiron is making a difference off the bench.

The Paraguayan winger takes his man on and crosses for Jonjo Shelvey, who scuffs his shot goalward and it squirms away.

50 mins: Small cry for a penalty from Newcastle as Ryan Fraser puts a cross in from the right towards Callum Wilson. Ben White comes across him and the Newcastle striker goes to ground. Referee unimpressed - nothing in that.

46 mins: Well, Steve Bruce has made a change. 

Miguel Almiron is the option he has brought off the bench. He replaces Andy Carroll, who was poor in that first half.

The Magpies get us back underway for the second half.

Steve Bruce needs to change something - and fast. Newcastle failed to test Mat Ryan in the opening 45 minutes.

They've already made one change as Allan Saint-Maximin was hauled off injured for Ryan Fraser. Could Joelinton be the option off the bench?

Newcastle bench: Ciaran Clark, Joelinton, Matt Ritchie, Emil Krafth, Miguel Almiron, Mark Gillespie

Tariq Lamptey has had a brilliant first-half for the Seagulls. Here's the timeline of his opening half of the match:

3 mins: Wins penalty after being hacked down by Allan Saint-Maximin.

8 mins: Plays crisp pass down the line for Leandro Trossard to set up Neal Maupay's second goal.

13 mins: Turns Saint-Maximin inside out and the Newcastle winger suffers an ankle injury. He is substituted later in the game.

28 mins: Makes goal-saving challenge to deny Callum Wilson a one-on-one opportunity.

45+4 mins: Fires shot late in the half but Karl Darlow saves.

If there were fans in St James' Park, they would be booing. Newcastle have been dire in this opening 45 minutes.

Neal Maupay scored two in the first eight minutes but young full-back Tariq Lamptey was key in the build-up of both goals. Graham Potter's side have been sharp and impressive as they search for their first points of the season.

Steve Bruce's side had just one shot in the first-half, which was not on target. The Magpies boss needs a rethink. 

45+4 mins: Tariq Lamptey nearly puts the game beyond all doubt when the ball falls to him in the penalty area.

The full-back fires a low shot towards the goal but Karl Darlow saves well with his feet and holds onto the rebound. 

45 mins: Ryan Fraser gets the first chance to stretch his legs and gets to the byline. He loops a cross into the danger area and Lewis Dunk is there to head over the bar for a corner to the Magpies.

We're into the first of FIVE minutes of stoppage time at the end of this first-half.

44 mins: Brighton win a free-kick which is cleared as far as Yves Bissouma, who takes a touch before blazing a shot into the stands.

42 mins: Newcastle still haven't tested Mat Ryan in the Brighton goal yet. Andy Carroll and Callum Wilson haven't really linked up front yet. 

39 mins: Leandro Trossard, who scored against Chelsea last week, runs straight through the Newcastle mdifield and shapes to shoot.

The Belgian pulls the trigger but the ball goes harmlessly over the bar. 

33 mins: Someone who is injured is Allan Saint-Maximin, who has not been able to recover from his earlier knock.

He's been hauled off for Ryan Fraser, who joined on a free transfer from Bournemouth earlier this summer.

Sportmail's CRAIG HOPE at St James' Park: 'Even if Tariq Lamptey had gone off injured after 30mins (he's back on but looking a bit sore), I think I would still have given him man of the match.'

28 mins: Newcastle have slight opening as Brighton give the ball away cheaply in the middle of the park.

Jonjo Shelvey plays in Callum Wilson but Lamptey sprints back to make a goal-saving challenge.

The young full-back was badly hurt by the challenge and looked in pain. He's back on the pitch now, though. 

26 mins: Tariq Lamptey continues his havoc on the Newcastle defence. He beats Jamal Lewis in a sprint race and the Magpies defender has no choice but to bring him down. The former Norwich man is in the book.

Two yellow cards for Newcastle so far this afternoon. Both down to Lamptey's pace.

Sportsmail's CRAIG HOPE at St James' Park: 'Brighton right-back Tariq Lamptey was getting the better of Allan Saint-Maximin to such an extent (at both ends of the pitch) that the Newcastle winger has now switched flanks.'

25 mins: Steve Bruce makes a minor tactical switch. He's swapped Jeff Hendrick and Allan Saint-Maximin on the wings. 

21 mins: Finally. Something from Newcastle. 

Saint-Maximin, who is moving a lot better right now, feeds Callum Wilson down the right. He moves towards goal but Aaron Webster puts in the block.

At the other end, Yves Bissouma lets fly from 20 yards out but it goes way over the bar. 

15 mins: Lamptey capitalises on Saint-Maximin's injury by getting in down the right-hand side. He puts in a low cross into the penalty area but Federico Fernandez gets in the way.

The tall centre-half nearly deflects the ball into his own net by Karl Darlow holds the ball well. Brighton look sharp, Newcastle are struggling. 

13 mins: More woe for Newcastle as Allan Saint-Maximin is struggling with an ankle problem. He's trying to carry on but he is not moving well.

At the other end, Lamptey fires away on the counter attack but his final touch is too big when through on goal and the ball is cleared.

11 mins: Tariq Lamptey is having a brilliant game. The wing-back is running rings around Newcastle at the moment.

Jonjo Shelvey hacks the teenager down in the middle of the pitch which earns him a place in the referee's book.

8 mins: Goal given! Both Maupay and Trossard were onside in the move and Graham Potter's side have a two-goal lead. 

What a start by the Seagulls! Steve Bruce does not know where to look...

7 mins: Another good Brighton move and Newcastle are saved by the offisde flag.

Lamptey puts in another good pass down the right and Leandro Trossard is away. He finds Maupay in the middle who taps home past Karl Darlow but the linesman puts his flag up.

VAR is having a look though...

4 mins: Confident from Neal Maupay, who slams the penalty in off the post. The Frenchman had ten goals last season, he's off the mark this time around. 

3 mins: And Brighton have a spot kick! Tariq Lamptey continues his positive start and is hacked down by Alan Saint-Maximin in the area. Neal Maupay to take...

2 mins: Positive start for Brighton and their promising full-back Tariq Lamptey. He puts in a dangerous cross towards Neal Maupay in the six yard box but Jamal Lascelles is there to make a vital stop.

0 mins: We're underway at St James' Park. Brighton kick us off...

The players are in the tunnel so let's get a reminder of how these teams line-up this afternoon...

Newcastle XI: Darlow, Manquillo, Fernandez, Lascelles, Lewis, Hayden, Shelvey, Hendrick, Saint-Maximin, Carroll, Wilson

Brighton XI: Ryan, White, Dunk, Webster, Lamptey, Bissouma, Alzate, March, Trossard, Maupay, Connolly

Just under 20 minutes until the first kick-off of the 2020-21 season at St James' Park and the players are going through the motions pre-match...

There are plenty of new signings in the Newcastle starting line-up but Steve Bruce's transfer activity is not done yet.

Sportsmail understands the Magpies are close to a deal for Peruvian midfielder Rdorigo Vilca in a move that could cost the club around £250,000.

Here's Simon Jones' story on the proposed move:

It was a difficult opening game for Brighton, who lost 3-1 to top-four challengers Chelsea on Monday evening. 

The Seagulls did look impressive in the game and were unlucky not to take anything from the game. Graham Potter needs a win to avoid any early talk of a relegation dogfight with Brighton looking to stay in the top-flight for a fifth successive season.

Steve Bruce may have been expecting another survival battle this season at Newcastle but has the opportunity to get maximum points from his opening two games.

The Magpies beat West Ham 2-0 last weekend thanks to goals from new boys Jeff Hendrick and Callum Wilson. 

After a summer filled with takeover speculation, Newcastle fans could start dreaming about a top-half finish with victory today. 

To say Newcastle vs Brighton has been an exciting Premier League fixture is a massive overstatement.

Since both sides were promoted to the top-fight in 2017, there have been just four goals in the six games between the two. To make matters worse, both of last season's games ended 0-0.

If we could have some goals this afternoon then that would be great. 

Graham Potter makes just one switch to the side that lost to Chelsea on Monday. 

Adam Lallana, who limped off in the first half of his Seagulls debut, drops down to the bench and Aaron Connolly gets the nod ahead of the ex-Liverpool man.

The Irishman partners Neal Maupay up front.

Newcastle have named the same line-up that beat West Ham 2-0 last weekend. It means Callum Wilson partners Andy Carroll up front while Ryan Fraser has to settle for another spot on the bench.

New boys Jeff Hendrick and Jamal Lewis also make their first appearance at St James' Park as a Magpies player.

Good afternoon all and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League clash between Newcastle and Brighton.

The two teams had different starts to the new season last weekend though three points this afternoon would help either side cast away any early relegation woes.
