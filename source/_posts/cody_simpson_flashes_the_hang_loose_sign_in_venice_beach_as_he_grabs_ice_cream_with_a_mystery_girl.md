He's a free agent, and it looks like he's relishing that status. 

Cody Simpson was spotted in Venice Beach, California on Friday, running around barefoot and grabbing a cone of ice cream with a mystery woman.

The Australian musician, 23, rocked a sporty ensemble for the outing, in a blue baseball cap, black Engine t-shirt and grey gym shorts.

Cody seemed in good spirits, flashing the 'hang loose' sign with his hand at the shutterbugs as he made his way with no footwear. 

As for his ice cream companion, she was a different date from the one Cody was seen with earlier this week, when he was snapped out for lunch in LA.  

Simpson's companion on Friday had a cheetah-print face mask which hung from one ear, and she wore a black tank top paired with bluejeans.

The sightings this week come as Simpson continues to embrace the single life, after his ten-month-long relationship with one Miley Cyrus came to an end in August.

Miley, 27, confirmed she'd split from Cody after less than a year of dating on Instagram in August, telling fans the pair are taking time apart to 'work on' themselves.

The Wrecking Ball hitmaker said she remains friends with the Australian singer, whom she has known for a decade.

Referencing her split from ex-husband Liam Hemsworth in August last year, Miley began: 'A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me, and control my narrative, and I'm just not accepting that.

'So today, it came out that me and my boyfriend have broken up,' she added.

She continued: 'It was confirmed by a "reliable source" even though no one is reliable in a relationship except the individuals who are participating in it.

'But right now, two halves can't make a whole and we're individually just working on ourselves to become the people that we wanna be, like everybody else at this age.'

Miley added: 'We are just deciding who we wanna be in our lives, what we wanna do, and so don't make it some drama story if next week we're hanging out, getting pizza.

'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not.'

On his own: 'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not,' Miley said of Cody; seen here this week on Instagram

The couple began dating in September 2019, shortly after Miley had ended her fling with U.S. reality star Kaitlynn Carter.

She was previously married to actor Hemsworth, but they separated in August 2019 after seven months of marriage.

And as for Cody, he seemed to be inspired later on Friday, strumming his guitar on his Instagram Stories while singing Nina Simone's timeless song Lilac Wine.

The lyrics he posted included: 'I lost myself on a cool damp night | Gave myself in that misty light | Was hypnotized by a strange delight'.
