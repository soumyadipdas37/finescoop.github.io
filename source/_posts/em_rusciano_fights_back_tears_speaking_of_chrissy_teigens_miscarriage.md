Em Rusciano fought back tears as she praised model Chrissy Teigen for 'bravely sharing her pain' after she revealed her miscarriage in photos she shared to Instagram on Thursday. 

Appearing on The Project, the 41-year-old Em, who has been open about her own miscarriage in 2017, showed compassion and praise for the Hollywood star.     

'[Something that] took all the air out of my lungs was as the devastating news that model Chrissy Teigen shared in some heartbreaking photos about the loss of her third child,' she said, immediately breaking down.

Em praised Chrissy for sharing her 'incredibly brave and raw' images, before explaining they were a reminder of her own lost pregnancy.     

'I think that kind of intimate pain ... when I looked at it, it took me back," she said, citing how one in four pregnancies end in a miscarriage.  

Em reflected on the loss of her own child, and the emotional journey she had. 

Emotional: '[Something] took all the air out of my lungs was as the devastating news that model Chrissy Teigen shared in some heartbreaking photos about the loss of her third child,' she said, immediately breaking down.

'When I went through it, I felt so alone and so overwhelmed,' she said. 

'To have someone of her stature post that, I think so many women are going to feel seen, and so many women will be permission to grieve properly.' 

Em finished by saying she hoped it allowed women to speak about the experience.    

Brave: 'I think that kind of intimate pain ... when I looked at it, it took me back, and I know a lot of women watching now - one in four pregnancies end this way,' Em said. Pictured: Chrissy Teigen and husband, John Legend 

'I hope that this encourages more people to talk about it. Because it is a horrible thing to go through and to feel alone when so many of us do go through it. 

She finished: 'I really hope that some good comes from this. But my heart just goes out to her.'   

Chrissy shared the heartbreaking news with a post and series of images on social media on Wednesday night, saying their little boy, 'Jack', has died following 'so many complications'.

Personal tragedy: Em spoke openly about her own miscarriage back in 2017, sharing that she had lost a son named Ray, in an emotional social media post. Here with husband, Scott

'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we've never felt before. We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn't enough'.

The devastating post included five black-and-white photos taken at the hospital, showing Chrissy crying on her bed as well as a shot showing her and John cradling their son.

She wrote: 'About 10 weeks ago I got the most wondrous surprise. I found out I was pregnant. I was going to announce it this Monday as we'd hit 13 weeks, but instead I will be at home in the most exquisite pain I can possibly fathom. 

'Yesterday I found out that my little boy, was lost to me. When my obstetrician told Scotty and I his words seemed foreign somehow.

'I'd only just seen my baby the week before on the ultra sound, kicking and waving. I'd heard his heart beat and began to imagine what type of person he'd become.' 

Em later went on to give birth to her son Elio Arthur Rusciano-Barrow in January, 2019.
