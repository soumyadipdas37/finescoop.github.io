A Florida couple have been arrested after authorities say they held a woman captive for 48 hours and beat, burned, cut, drugged and repeatedly sexually battered her until she managed to escape. 

Alexis Crawford, 20, and Christian White, 30, were apprehended on Monday and booked into the Levy County jail on charges of false imprisonment, sexual battery and aggravated battery. 

According to a statement from the Levy County Sheriff's Office, the case began unfolding on Sunday when the agency got a 'bizarre' 911 call concerning a 39-year-old woman who was held against her will at a home on NE 76th Street near Bronson. 

'LCSO Detectives responded to the scene and the victim told them a horrific story,' the sheriff's office stated.

Alexis Crawford, 20 (left), and Christian White, 30 (right), have been charged with false imprisonment, sexual battery and aggravated battery for allegedly holding a woman captive for two days and torturing her 

The victim recounted how she met White and Crawford, described as being on the run from Clay County authorities, through a mutual friend with whom they were staying on Saturday.  

That evening, the 39-year-old woman offered to pick up dinner for the group, but when she returned to the house the situation took a violent turn. 

The victim said she got into a fight with the 4-foot-11, 112-pound Crawford, who allegedly grabbed her and attempted to restrain her with zip ties. 

White then got involved in the fight and allegedly helped Crawford restrain the victim's feet and arms with zip ties. 

White has a vast criminal record in Clay County, including charges of domestic battery, domestic battery by strangulation, burglary and a host of traffic violations 

Over the next 48 hours, the woman was punched, cut, burned, drugged and repeatedly sexually battered, before she escaped on Sunday, according to the sheriff's office. 

Responding detectives observed cuts and burn marks on the victim's body that were consistent with her version of events.

The woman was transported to a hospital to be treated for her injuries.  

Later that same day, detectives tracked down and arrested Crawford and White. They are currently being held in jail on $3.25million bond each. 

Online arrest records indicate that White has a vast criminal record in Clay County, including charges of domestic battery, domestic battery by strangulation, burglary, and a long string of minor vehicular offenses dating back more than a decade. 

White's entry on the Levy County jail's roster lists him as a 'high risk' inmate.
