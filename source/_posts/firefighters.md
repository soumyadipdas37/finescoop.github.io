description: Our 28th October article last year Striking firemen want £10,000 pay rise mentioned that fire crews could already expect to pocket up to £50,000 a year after overtime. We would like to clarify that this top sum referred to what a senior manager might expect to earn. We are sorry if this was misunderstood.

Our 28th October article last year 'Striking firemen want £10,000 pay rise' mentioned that 'fire crews could already expect to pocket up to £50,000 a year after overtime.' We would like to clarify that this top sum referred to what a senior manager might expect to earn. We are sorry if this was misunderstood.
