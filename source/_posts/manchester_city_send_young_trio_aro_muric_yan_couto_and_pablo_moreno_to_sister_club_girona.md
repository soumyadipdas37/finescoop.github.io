Manchester City are sending a trio of young talents to sister club Girona on loan for the season.

Aro Muric, Yan Couto and Pablo Moreno are all expected to join the Spanish second division side in the coming days.

Moreno has a burgeoning reputation after signing from Juventus over the summer as part of an academy recruitment drive at City.

The 18-year-old is capped at youth level for Spain and can play anywhere across the front three.

City are hopeful of developing all three players into challenging for a first-team berth in the future, although the move to Girona is of more immediate significance to Muric.

The Kosovo international endured a difficult loan spell at Nottingham Forest last year, dropping out of the team after just four Championship games.

Full-back Couto signed from Coritiba in July with City beating Barcelona to his signature

Muric had a previous loan spell at NAC Breda cut short following a serious knee injury suffered by Claudio Bravo at the beginning of the 2018-19 campaign.

The 21-year-old was impressive during City’s run to winning the Carabao Cup that season but now needs consistent games.

Couto is a full back signed from Coritiba in Brazil for around £5million in July as City beat Barcelona to the 18-year-old’s signature.
