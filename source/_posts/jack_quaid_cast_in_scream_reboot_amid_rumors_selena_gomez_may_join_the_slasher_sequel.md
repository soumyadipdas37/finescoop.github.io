Jack Quaid is joining the cast of the upcoming Scream reboot.

The second generation actor, 28, just signed onto the Paramount Pictures and Spyglass Media venture, according to Variety.

The son of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan will join original stars Courteney Cox and David Arquette as they reprise their roles as news reporter Gale Weathers and sheriff Dewey Riley in the new film.

Quaid was first recognized for his work on the first two Hunger Games films. He currently appears in the gritty Amazon superhero series The Boys. His Scream character has not yet been named.

In addition to Quaid, Cox, and Arquette, the film's cast includes Vida's Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega of You and Jane The Virgin fame.

Fans threw another name into the mix last month when they noticed Cox, Arquette, Barrera and Ortega all began to follow actress/singer Selena Gomez on Instagram.

Intensifying rumors, the Friends alum told Gomez 'Can't wait to meet you' in a comment under a mid-August social media post.

Still, there has been no official news of a Selena casting.

And fans will have to wait some time for the fright fest.

Last week the movie's release date was pushed back from next year until January 2022.

But horror buffs got just a taste of a teaser last Friday when the series' official Twitter account shared a fleeting 10-second clip of the legendary Ghost Face mask.

'On January 14, 2022… We’re going to hear you SCREAM,' they tweeted along with an ominous closeup of the mask. 

The Scream saga started in 1996 with a bloody, self-referential teen horror romp directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson.

Scream was a sure hit, grossing $173million globally after being produced for a reported $15m. Sequels came in 1997, 2000 and 2011.

Filming on number five was initially expected to take place later this year in Wilmington, North Carolina. 

Ready Or Not's Matthew Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett are directing the reboot from a script penned by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick.
