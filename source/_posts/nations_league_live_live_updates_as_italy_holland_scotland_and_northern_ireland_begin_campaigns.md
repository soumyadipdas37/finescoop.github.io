Another night of Nations League action is upon us as Italy, Holland, Northern Ireland and Scotland all begin their campaign tonight. 

The Italians kick off their tournament against Bosnia and Herzegovina as Roberto Mancini hopes his side can get off to a fast start on home soil. 

The other match from Group 1 in League A will see Virgil van Dijk and his Holland team-mates host Poland after the recent departure of head coach Ronald Koeman, who left for Barcelona.  

Elsewhere, two home nations are beginning their new Nations League ventures as Northern Ireland travel to Romania in Group 1 of League B, whilst over in Group 2, Scotland welcome Israel as Steve Clarke hopes to begin in winning ways with ties against Czech Republic and Slovakia to come.

Here, Sportsmail's IEUAN IVETT will provide all the updates as another night of Nations League action unfolds.
