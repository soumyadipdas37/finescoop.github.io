Showing off her sun-kissed glow, Georgia accentuated her stunning features by styling her tresses into a sleek updo.

Nicole, 28, opted for a casual look in a black crop top and blue skinny jeans along with a black blazer.

Fran, 29, donned a black sleeveless minidress for the outing while she also sported a pair of matching heels. 

It comes after Georgia revealed she already feels 'so much more confident' with her new boobs, and said she had the operation after her 3.5stone weight loss left her with sagging skin and stretch marks.

The television personality told Closer magazine: 'I'd see myself on TV wearing swimwear and think, "Oh, my boobs don't look good", and it made me feel very self-conscious.'

Georgia went on to say she would limit what she would, only opting for padded tops or tops with high necklines. 

Explaining why she had surgery, the reality star said: 'I'm around 8.5st now, but when I was about 19 I was nearer 12st and my boobs were a lot bigger, I was working abroad and had a really unhealthy lifestyle, and I'd drink and just eat junk.

'But when my weight dropped a bit, so did my boobs, it looked like there was space to fill. I also had a problem with inverted nipples that I wanted to fix.'

Georgia first found fame with a brief stint on The Only Way Is Essex in 2014, before becoming a household name with an appearance on 2017's Love Island.

The bubbly reality star then gained an American fanbase when she starred in series 33 of The Challenge in 2018, reaching the final and finishing in eighth place.

The Challenge saw reality stars from around the world come together to compete in a series of physical and mental challenges in the hope of the scooping prize money.
