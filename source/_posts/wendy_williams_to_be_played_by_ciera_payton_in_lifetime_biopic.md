Wendy Williams, 56, is being immortalized in an upcoming Lifetime biopic. 

Actress Ciera Payton, 34, will take on the role as the daytime TV host opposite actor Morocco Omari, 45, who will play Williams' ex-husband Kevin Hunter, according to Deadline on Thursday.

The TV movie about the former radio host turned sometimes controversial daytime television darling will be accompanied by a full-length documentary on her life.

Production is set to begin this month on the biopic and will be directed by Darren Grant.

Wendy herself is executive producing the film which, according to the official description, will be 'a revealing look at Wendy’s journey, from her scrappy upstart days in urban radio to the success of her own syndicated talk show.'

Ciera, who is taking on the titular role, was initially discovered by Tyler Perry. She's best known for projects like The Oval, She's Gotta Have It and A Madea Family Funeral.

Playing Wendy's ex-husband Kevin, who is also her ex-manager and an ex-executive producer on The Wendy Williams Show, is actor Morocco Omari from Empire and P-Valley.

According to the official description it will be 'a revealing look at Wendy’s journey, from her scrappy upstart days in urban radio to the success of her own syndicated talk show'

Wendy and Kevin had an acrimonious split in 2019 after DailyMail.com broke the news that Hunter had fathered a child with his longtime mistress. The star later filed for divorce after 21 years of marriage. 

Before their split, sources said that part of the reason Kevin didn't leave Wendy over the years was because she supported him financially.

Kevin was an executive producer on her talk show and her manager but Wendy fired him from both gigs after their marriage crumbled. 

Wendy has hosted the syndicated hit The Wendy Williams Show since 2008 and, prior to that, was a longtime radio DJ.

Wendy Williams: The Hot Topic, the working title for the film, is a nod to the popular opening segment of her talk show where she serves up her often news-making opinions on the latest celebrity gossip.

The TV movie expected to be released sometime in 2021 on Lifetime and will be followed by a documentary.

'In it, Williams sheds her private persona and speaks directly to the camera from her Manhattan apartment, discussing the joy and the humiliation she has experienced since childhood,' Deadline reported.
