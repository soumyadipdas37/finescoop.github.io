She gave birth to her third child just a few month ago.     

And on Sunday, Lara Worthington (née Bingle) showed off her incredible post-baby body while out for a stroll with her dog.

The model-turned-businesswoman, 33, looked positively radiant as she hiked in the Hollywood Hills alongside her two boys and her puppy.

Lara enjoyed the fresh air as she held tightly onto the dog while soaking up the California sunshine on the brisk walk.

The statuesque stunner wore a long-sleeve blue t-shirt which flaunted a hint of her midriff. She paired it with blue tights. 

She finished her outfit with a pair of black Adidas shoes.

Lara accentuated her flawless skin with next to no makeup. She wore her blonded tresses back away from her face. 

It comes after the beauty modelled a tight black bodysuit earlier this month. Taking to Instagram, she posed with a black gym ball in her hand.

Lara stretched her athletic physique in another snap, and showed off her flexibility in the images.

'One week into three weeks working with @fluidformpilates... stay tuned,' she captioned the post.  

Lara lives in Los Angeles with her husband, actor Sam Worthington, who is best known for playing Jake Sully in the Avatar film series.

Earlier this year, the notoriously private couple welcomed their third child, a boy whose name they haven't disclosed.

The pair, who are also parents to sons Rocket, four, and Racer, two, are yet to reveal when exactly their baby was born.  

Lara had confirmed her pregnancy in November, telling Vogue Australia: 'I'm having a boy, early next year. It's my third boy and we're all very excited and very happy.

'I think any addition brings joy and happiness to the family, but more so when you can share it with the other boys. It's such a boy's club in my house!'
