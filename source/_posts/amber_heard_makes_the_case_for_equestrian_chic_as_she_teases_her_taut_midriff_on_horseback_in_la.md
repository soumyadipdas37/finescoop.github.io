Amber Heard has been continuing to fight a messy legal battle against ex-husband Johnny Depp.

But the Austin-born actress is finding ways to enjoy her downtime, after her upcoming court date was delayed.

She made a good case for equestrian chic on Monday, as she teased her taut midriff in a stunning black and white look while riding horseback in Los Angeles.

The 34-year-old sported a white button-down shirt, which was tied above her stomach, showing off her toned tummy.

It was paired with some skintight high-waisted black pants, tucked into a pair of black and brown leather riding boots, with a blue bandana face mask.  

Heard has posted photos of herself riding horses to Instagram in the past, calling it her 'happy place.'

She took to Instagram after her most recent riding session, in front of what appears to be a jumping course, writing: 'Barrel proximity = happiness'

The Aquaman actress also posted a photo to her Story, urging her 3.9million Instagram followers to donate to Habitat for Humanity. 

Depp, 57, recently requested a delay in their upcoming January court dates, which conflict with the filming schedule for Fantastic Beasts 3 in London. 

Heard argued in response that he's made 'no effort whatsoever' to make his schedule work with the court's, in the $50million defamation suit he filed against her early last year. 

Her team responded in court documents: 'Mr. Depp decided that, rather than speak with his employer to work his film commitments around his trial, he asks this court to subserviently reschedule around his employment and the entire film schedule and production.'

They also stated: 'Although Mr. Depp had been contacted in late June or July with the proposed filming dates, he did not alert [movie bigs] to the trial dates.' 

She argued that if the court accepted his request for a delay, it would adversely prevent her from filming Aquaman 2 in February.

The court subsequently postponed their trial to May, not because either of their filming schedules, but citing the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has already forced them to delay twice.      

The lawsuit comes after Heard wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post in December of 2018, which Depp's lawyers claimed 'depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.'

Meanwhile, Heard has launched a $100million countersuit, accusing her ex-husband of using trolls and social media bots in a 'smear campaign' against her.

She said in court documents that she's finally 'fighting back,' as she seeks to have Depp's 'frivolous lawsuit' tossed, claiming it continues his 'abuse and harassment.'

The documents read: 'This stream of false and defamatory accusations against Ms. Heard is all an attempt to ruin her life and career, simply because she was a victim of domestic abuse and violence at the hands of Mr. Depp, and had the audacity and temerity to finally come forward to end it.'
