Manchester City's social media team made an embarrassing gaffe on the club's website when they claimed to have signed long-term target Kalidou Koulibaly instead of £64million new man Ruben Dias.

City have been consistently linked with a move for Napoli centre back Koulibaly this summer, but instead it was Dias who came through the door on Tuesday in a club-record deal.

Despite the arrival of the Portuguese defender from Benfica, it appears the club had a template set up for the Koulibaly signing instead, and forgot to change a section at the bottom of the article.

Fans, therefore, were given a chance to win a signed Koulibaly shirt, despite him still plying his trade in Serie A for Napoli.

The mistake was quickly rectified, but not before it was screenshotted and shared across social media for the world to see.

Dias' arrival will significantly strengthen Pep Guardiola's defence after they conceded five goals against Leicester at the weekend.

As part of the deal, Nicolas Otamendi has gone the other way for £13.7m, and Dias has signed a six-year contract at the Etihad.

Manchester City's mistake comes just weeks after Chelsea's media team had made a gaffe of their own, failing to spell their own new signing's name right on the website.

Kai Havertz's £89m arrival was huge news across the world, but the club's 'Kia Havertz' mistake picked up plenty of traction on social media.
