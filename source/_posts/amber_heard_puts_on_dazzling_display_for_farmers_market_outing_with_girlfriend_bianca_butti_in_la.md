Amber Heard is in the middle of a messy legal battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp.

But the Austin-born actress is enjoying her downtime with loved ones, after her upcoming court date was delayed.

She put on a dazzling display Monday in a black halter neck dress, trimmed in eyelet lace, as she stepped out at a farmers market in Los Angeles with girlfriend Bianca Butti and her dog.

The 34-year-old finished the ensemble with a set of gold earrings, matching bangle, gold rings and black leather slip-on sandals.

Butti, 39, wore a white spotted dress shirt tucked into jeans, which were ripped at the hem, with black leather boots, blue aviators and a grey wide-brimmed hat. 

Depp, 57, recently requested a delay in his upcoming January court dates with Heard, which conflict with the filming schedule for Fantastic Beasts 3 in London. 

The Aquaman actress argued in response that he's made 'no effort whatsoever' to make his schedule work with the court's, in the $50million defamation suit he filed against her early last year.

Her team responded in court documents: 'Mr. Depp decided that, rather than speak with his employer to work his film commitments around his trial, he asks this court to subserviently reschedule around his employment and the entire film schedule and production.'  

They also stated: 'Although Mr. Depp had been contacted in late June or July with the proposed filming dates, he did not alert [movie bigs] to the trial dates.' 

She argued that if the court accepted his request for a delay, it would adversely prevent her from filming Aquaman 2 in February.

The court subsequently postponed their trial to May, not because either of their filming schedules, but citing the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has already forced them to delay twice.      

The lawsuit comes after Heard wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post in December of 2018, which Depp's lawyers claimed 'depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.'

The Pineapple Express actress was married to Depp from 2015 to 2017, accusing him of abuse during their divorce and ultimately settling for $7million, which she donated to the ACLU and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.

Meanwhile, Heard has launched a $100million countersuit, accusing her ex-husband of using trolls and social media bots in a 'smear campaign' against her.

She said in court documents that she's finally 'fighting back,' as she seeks to have Depp's 'frivolous lawsuit' tossed, claiming it continues his 'abuse and harassment.'

The documents read: 'This stream of false and defamatory accusations against Ms. Heard is all an attempt to ruin her life and career, simply because she was a victim of domestic abuse and violence at the hands of Mr. Depp, and had the audacity and temerity to finally come forward to end it.'
