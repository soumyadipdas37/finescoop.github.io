Paulina Porizkova has opened up about selling the New York City townhouse she shared with her late husband Ric Ocasek for three decades, saying the home where she raised her two sons has 'picked its next family.'

The 55-year-old model took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a photo of herself stepping out of her longtime home with a cardboard box in her arms as she gets ready to say goodbye to the property. 

Paulina is wearing a baggy shirt dress, and her gray-streaked hair is pulled off of her face. In her caption, she explained that she was hoping to sell the home to another family, and she was happy to report that she had gotten her wish.  

Sold: Paulina, 55 took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a photo of herself packing up her New York City townhouse, revealing another family is moving in 

End of an era: Paulina and her late husband Ric Ocasek lived in the Gramercy Park townhouse for 30 years

'Yes, the house that’s kept us all safe for thirty years, is now to embrace another family. I had a little talk with it when it was being shown, and told it to woo the sort of people it wanted. Or I’d sell it to Russian developers,' she wrote. 

'The house picked its next family. And I must say: it couldn’t have picked a better family,' she added. 'The spirit of art and love will stay right here where it belongs.'

At the end of her post, Paulina shared that the photo was taken by her new assistant Katy Allen-Kefalinos, and her 'super comfy dress' is from her cousin Kamila's company Julie & Kamila. 

'I risk wearing it to shreds,' she admitted. 

The day before, Paulina posted a photo of herself sporting wild hair and sweats as she packed up one of the rooms in the townhouse. 

Getting ready: The day before, the model posted a picture of herself packing up the living room. The five-bedroom townhouse sold for $10 million earlier this month

Moving: Earlier this month, she had garbage bags filled with stuff lined up in the hallway in her townhouse. She revealed a lot of the stuff was going to Ric's granddaughter Olivia Otcasek 

'A different kind of exercise: taking a break from "boxing." And the fuzzies are helping out,' she captioned the image, which shows her sitting on the floor with her dog and cat, surrounded by boxes. 

Paulina and Ric had quietly separated in 2017, and their Gramercy Park townhouse was originally listed in 2016 for $15.25 million, according to The Real Deal. 

Less than a month after the model found The Cars frontman dead in their home on September 15, 2019, at age 75, it was put back on the market for $13.9 million. After another price slash, the sale of the home closed earlier this month at $10 million.  

Dating back to the 1850s, the 5,760-square-foot, four-story townhouse has five bedrooms, 4.5 baths, a back garden, and a private recording studio. 

According to Mansion Global, the buyers only saw the property twice and plan to renovate it. 

Paulina has been mourning the loss of her estranged husband for the past year, and due to the coronavirus pandemic, she has spent most of 2020 quarantined in her home in upstate New York, only recently returning to the city every so often.

Back home: Paulina has started returning to the city in recent months 

Company: Paulina's son Oliver is pictured with their cat in their New York City townhouse 

She has been sharing photos of herself packing boxes, cleaning, and sorting through mementos for weeks now, though she had just recently confirmed her home had been sold. 

In one image from September 14, she has garbage bags filled with stuff lined up in the hallway in her townhouse. She revealed a lot of the stuff was going to Ric's granddaughter Olivia Otcasek. 

'A half a room’s worth,' Paulina wrote. 'This will take some time. Thank goodness for a quick visit from @oliviaotcasek who loves art books and fits all my old clothes and my new assistant @katerinawinemixer_ , super capable and also a fine photographer.' 

Olivia's last name is spelled Otcasek and not Ocasek like her famous grandfather's because her father Christopher had kept the original spelling of the family name.   

Ric had six sons, two from each of his three marriages. He and Paulina share sons Jonathan, 26, and Oliver, 22, who spell their last name Ocasek. 

Another photo from two weeks ago shows Paulina surrounded by piles of books and papers while cleaning out the office in the townhouse. 

'Ah... memories. Hope you guys are really into photos like this one — I’m not likely to be doing anything else for a while,' she captioned the image. 'As for my #wednesdaywearables: today — to sort and shred — I’m wearing the most comfortable dress I own, a @junibk original, designed by my cousin Kamila @topbunartist.'

Cleaning: Another photo from two weeks ago shows Paulina surrounded by piles of books and papers while cleaning out the office in the townhouse.

Hard to handle: Paulina has admitted that she has had a hard time packing up the belongings she shared with her late husband 

She also recently posted a snapshot of herself holding a blanket up to her face while cleaning out her home.

'Beginning the process of letting go of things- letting go of thirty years — letting go of everything I’ve known — everything that made me feel safe. Today is not [a] good day,' she admitted. 'But I know I have to keep moving. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. #sad #overwhelmed #feelinglonely #theendisjustthebeginning.' 

Earlier this month, Paulina shared a thinly-veiled revelation about her relationship with her late husband, hinting that The Cars frontman cheated on his second wife with her. 

She shared a throwback photo of herself with Ric on the set of the music video where they first met while opening up about their courtship. 

'I now realize our love started with a betrayal (of his then-wife) and ended with betrayal,' Paulina wrote alongside the photo, referring not only to the first days of their relationship, but also to the final days, during which Ric wrote her out of his will, accusing her of 'abandoning him.' 

Memories: Paulina recently spoke out about her relationship with late husband while sharing an image from the music video set where they met 

Opening up: The supermodel hinted that Ric cheated on his second wife Suzanne, whom he divorced in 1988, when embarking on his romance with her after they met ini 1984

The image shared by Paulina shows the model posing alongside Ric and director Timothy Hutton on the set of the music video for Cars' hit Drive in 1984, which is where the model and her late husband first met.

At the time, Ric was married to his second wife Suzanne Ocasek, with whom he tied the knot in 1971. The pair — who had two children together — divorced in 1988, four years after Ric met a then-18-year-old Paulina, and just one year before he wed the model.

Before Ric met Suzanne, he was married to his first wife Constance; they wed in 1963, before divorcing in 1971, just months before his second wedding.

Although it has previously been suggested that Ric's romance with Paulina overlapped his marriage to Suzanne, neither he nor his wives have ever publicly commented on it — until now.

Ric and Paulina were married for three decades before they separated in 2017, but they had not yet finalized their divorce when he passed away last September.

In her Instagram post, she referred to their 35-year-long romance, suggesting that they started their relationship almost immediately after they met on the set of The Cars' music video. 

Details: In her post, Paulina, who is pictured with Ric in 1990, one year after they married, referred to their '35-year' romance, suggesting they got together just after meeting

Controversy: At the time Ric (pictured with Paulina in 2018), who passed away in September 2019, was still married to Suzanne, but the couple divorced in 1988 

Family: Ric and Paulina, who had two sons during their marriage, quietly separated in 2017, but they had not yet finalized their divorce when he passed away  

'In the thirty-five years we spent together, most of the years were good,' she continued. 'That is what I am trying to learn to remember.' 

Paulina has been incredibly candid about her struggle to deal with her grief over Ric's passing as well as her feelings of 'hurt and betrayal' over his decision to cut her out of his will in the wake of their separation.

He also left no provisions for his two eldest sons, Adam and Derek, from his marriage to Constance; however, his other four children were all included.

During an appearance on CBS This Morning in February — Paulina's first interview since her estranged husband's passing — she opened up about her conflicting feelings for Ric, admitting that she was devastated by his decision to cut her out of his will because he felt she had 'abandoned him.'

The couple was separated and going through a divorce when he died, but because they were not legally divorced, Paulina, as his widow, may be entitled under New York law to an 'elective share' of his estate.

Ric specifically addressed the rule in his will, stating: 'Even if I should die before our divorce is final… Paulina is not entitled to any elective share… because she has abandoned me.

However, unless it can be proven in court that she did abandon him, she will likely be entitled to a one-third share of the musician's assets, which are listed as $5 million in 'copyrights', $100,000 in 'tangible personal property,' and $15,000 in cash.
