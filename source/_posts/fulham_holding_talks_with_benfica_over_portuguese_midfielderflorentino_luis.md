The Premier League new boys have activated their £8m option to sign anchorman Reed from the south coast club following their promotion to the top flight.

And Lemina is set to move to Craven Cottage on loan for an initial £2m fee, with an obligation for Fulham to buy him if they stay up.

Midfielder Reed has spent the season on loan at play-off final winners Fulham from Southampton.

Fulham, who beat neighbours Brentford in extra time at Wembley to secure promotion, had an option in the deal to buy Reed for £8m if they clinched promotion and a lower fee if they failed to go up.
