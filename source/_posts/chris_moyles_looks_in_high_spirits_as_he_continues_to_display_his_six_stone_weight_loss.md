Chris recently discussed his weight loss and detailed how he struggles to maintain his new physique.

Speaking to Ross Kemp on his podcast The Kempcast, Chris admitted he still suffers from body dysmorphia, despite having shrunk from 18 stone to 12 stone.

He admitted his strict regimen of weighing himself daily and barely eating all day Monday-Friday, before enjoying himself at the weekends.

He also claimed he still 'feels fat'.

He said: 'Before lockdown, Monday, Wednesday, Friday I would do the show we would have a quick meeting... and then I'd get to the gym and I'd train 11-12 or 11-1, depending on how fat I was feeling. I'm feeling really fat at the moment!

'I'm fascinated by body dysmorphia because I really have an issue with body dysmorphia, which I think most people do. I've lost six stone from my worst weight when I was 18 stone!

'I know my body really well now, and I'm still learning. I don't have the metabolism of an 18-year-old girl or boy, I just don't.'

He continued: 'I will, and people don't believe me, but I weigh myself six days a week, and I know you shouldn't and I know it's not for everyone, but I do that so I can learn about how my body works.

'I will train Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and I will watch what I eat and I'll eat very little. I do intermittent fasting and I'll eat at 6:30PM or 7PM and I'll be fine. I need to do that from the weekends that I have.'
