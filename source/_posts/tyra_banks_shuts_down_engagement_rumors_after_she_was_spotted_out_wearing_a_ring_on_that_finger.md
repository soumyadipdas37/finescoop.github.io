Tyra Banks is emphatically denying rumors that she is engaged to her beau Louis Bélanger-Martin.

The 46-year-old supermodel unequivocally shut down speculation that she was seen sporting an engagement ring recently during an appearance on Tamron Hall's daytime talk show Wednesday.

Banks has been doing press recently for her latest gig as the new solo host for season 29 of Dancing With the Stars.

Rumor mill: Tyra Banks unequivocally shut down speculation that she was seen sporting an engagement ring recently during an appearance on Tamron Hall's daytime talk show Wednesday

Last month, Tyra and Louis were seen out and about in Santa Monica, California and eagle-eyed fans noticed the star wearing a ring on her left ring finger - the one traditionally reserved for engagement and wedding rings.

Blurry photos from the outing made details about the piece of jewelry unclear but considering the fact that the duo has been dating for a year, people jumped to conclusions.

When asked by Hall about the ring and the rumors, Tyra rolled her eyes and brushed them off, explaining that the ring in question is not even close to an engagement ring. 

'They're talking about the ring,' she said incredulously to the talk show host. 'The ring is a crab. It's shaped like a crab.'

'They're talking about the ring,' she said incredulously to Tamron. 'The ring is a crab. It's shaped like a crab. And it's an opal, not a diamond.'

Tamron was shocked to hear that the bauble was shaped like a crustacean.  'And it's an opal, not a diamond,' Banks continued.

Tyra said she wished she was wearing it for the interview so she could show off how clearly it is not a symbol of impending nuptials - it's just a crab ring.

'It is not a crab opal engagement ring. It is just a ring,' the Top Model host said. 'The press gets it right sometimes but a lot of times they're bored.'

Despite not being ready to walk down the aisle, Banks and Bélanger-Martin appear to be going strong in their relationship.

'It is not a crab opal engagement ring. It is just a ring,' the Top Model host said. 'The press gets it right sometimes but a lot of times they're bored.'

The controversy: This photo and this ring, snapped in August, is what sparked the rumors

The businessman and the model mogul were first romantically linked in October of last year and have been spotted out together frequently in Los Angeles recently.  

Tyra, meanwhile, is finding her footing as the new host of Dancing With The Stars, replacing both Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews for season 29 which premiered earlier this month.

Unfortunately, it hasn't been smooth sailing for the star and fans of the long-running celebrity competition series have been vicious about Tyra's performance on social media. 

After the season premiere, a majority of the tweets desperately begged for the return of veteran hosts Tom and Erin who were shockingly canned in July.
