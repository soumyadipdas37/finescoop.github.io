She sure loves spooky season.

Vanessa Hudgens was at it again on Instagram on Thursday, heralding the impending arrival of Halloween at the end of next month with a 'spooky' and rather early post in which she was done up in a somewhat witchy ensemble.

The singer-actress, 31, sparkled in the heavily made-up lewk, with pouty lips, a heart-shaped mole, glittery bat-shaped hair berets and large hoop earrings.

The High School Musical star added a violet-colored filter to one of the still images, as well as an eye sparkle.

Her eyes were particularly emphasized with the help of generous helpings of cosmetics. 

Hudgens wore a pair of shiny nameplate necklaces as well, which said 'Witch' and 'Craft'.

In the video component to Vanessa's post, some creepy ambient music played in the background as she preened and posed for the camera.

The starlet captioned the post, 'Just because it’s Thursday... spooky bratz doll? Loool #spookyseason'.

And curiously enough, the comparison was rather spot on.

Vanessa continued to have fun on Instagram using the Stories feature, uploading further images and clips of herself in the Bratz-inspired ensemble.

One funny shot showed her looking especially loopy, with the caption 'Literally sitting by myself watching the Lakers game like dissss'.

She kept the witchy vibe going in other passages on her Stories, showing some motivational workout snippets in which she used a devil horn filter as well as one which gave her pentagram stars on her cheeks.

Five days ago, the Say OK songstress shared another rather Halloween-y post, showing her in a goth look that was trick-or-treat ready.

The caption for that post read, 'It’s that time againnnn' along with a devil emoji.

Judging from years past, Vanessa is sure to continue flooding her feed with more spooky fare as Hallow's Eve approaches.
