Michael Schumacher's son Mick appears set to follow in his father's footsteps with Formula One training sessions planned for this year, according to reports.

As the son of Ferrari legend Michael, there are high hopes for 21-year-old Mick, while he fights for this season's Formula 2 title.

German television channel RTL had earlier received information that Mick was in line for his debut on Friday in the Tuscan Grand Prix free practice.

Mick is the son of F1 legend Michael Schumacher, who won seven World Championships

But the outlet now claims he will definitely not be driving for a Ferrari client - Alfa Romeo or Haas - in Formula 1 free practice in Mugello, with the report quoting his PR advisor Timo Gans as saying :'I cannot confirm this report [of him participating].'

However, the same report also states should this year take part in some F1 training sessions, but details such as when and where are yet to be decided.

Mick will also drive the Ferrari F2004, his father's last world champion car, before the team's 1000th Grand Prix race on Sunday in Monza, Italy.

Whether he would follow his father in representing Ferrari remains to be seen, their team principal Mattia Binotto has already talked up Mick's abilities from inside the Ferrari Driver Academy.

Mick is currently competing for the F2 title and won his first race of the season on Saturday

Last month, Binotto told Bild am Sonntag: 'He's doing very well this season in Formula 2. His job was to improve and make progress and he is doing that.

'We'll soon discuss what we're going to do with him next year.'

Schumacher won his first F2 race of 2020 with victory in the feature race at Monza on Saturday.

A series of finishes on the podium means has the German sits in second place in the junior division's championship, six points behind fellow Ferrari Academy ace Callum Ilott.

But Mick will realise he has a long path ahead to live up to the legacy of father Michael, 51, who holds the record for the most World Championship titles in the sport.

However, the seven-time winner suffered a serious head injury in December 2013 when he was skiing with his son, one of two children with wife Corinna.

After years of treatment, the racing legend is reportedly conscious but his family have ensured his health matters remain incredibly private.

FIA president Jean Todt, who oversaw much of Schumacher's success at Ferrari, visited the German in July and said: 'I saw Michael last week.

'He is fighting. I hope the world will be able to see him again. That is what he and his family are working towards.'
