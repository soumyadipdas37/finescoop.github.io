He might only be 11 years old, but Australian guitar prodigy Taj Farrant is a rockstar in the making.  

The budding musician has just released his debut single, Just Can't Sleep.

But that's not the only success the youngster has had, having already performed with the likes of Carlos Santana, KISS and Rob Thomas on stage.

He told The Music this month about his passion for music and said he became hooked on playing guitar after his father and grandfather took him to an AC/DC concert.   

'As soon as I heard Angus play Shook Me All Night Long I was hooked,' Taj said. 

He went on to say that performing with Carlos Santana in Las Vegas was a 'dream come true.'

'I still can't believe it actually happened!' Taj said, saying the musician gave him plenty of advice. 

He also spoke about performing with rock legends KISS and said it came about after he performed at the Viper Room in LA. 

'KISS and I hung out for a couple of hours. Such great guys,' Taj said.

Taj - who hails from the NSW Central Coast - boasts 192,000 subscribers on YouTube and has 82,000 Instagram followers. 

He first burst onto the scene by appearing on the Ellen DeGeneres Show early last year, before going on to appear on Australia's Got Talent.

Taj told Ellen about the AC/DC concert, saying: 'I was on my pop's shoulders and I said, I want to do that for the rest of my life. But I didn't start playing until I was seven.'

He said he took lessons for about two years, before his father started teaching him to play. 

According to The Daily Telegraph, Taj is a fully-endorsed guitarist and has a number of sponsorship deals under his belt.  

In February last year, his father told the publication: 'I guess his end goal was to be fully endorsed.'

He added: 'He's pretty much achieved everything he wanted to.'
