Ayda Field has hilariously detailed the extremely shaky start to her relationship with husband Robbie Williams.

Thankfully, after the ghosting  their meeting eventually went ahead, with the TV star describing their first date as 'the most bizarre, rock star, pop star, crazy date'.

Cheeky! Ayda Field has hilariously detailed the extremely shaky start to her relationship with husband Robbie Williams

Ayda and Robbie began dating in 2007 before marrying in his home in the Mulholland Estates, Beverly Hills in August 2010. 

The happy couple share Theodora, eight, Charlton, five, Colette, two, and seven-month-old Beau, whose arrival was a surprise to fans on Valentine's Day. 

In the podcast, Ayda spoke about meeting Robbie, saying: 'Finally he suggested lunch one day, and I said 'Okay, let's meet for lunch.' And then that day I never f*cking heard from him!' And I was like 'Oh you b*****d!'

When the date finally went ahead, she explained: 'We finally end up making a plan. All I'll say is it was the most bizarre, insane, rockstar, popstar, crazy first date. And at the end of it, I was totally smitten...

Fuming! Speaking on the Made By Mammas podcast, The X Factor judge, 41, revealed that when she first met the pop star, 46, he suggested they go on a date, however she said: 'And then that day I never f*cking heard from him!' (pictured last year)

'I was super impressed by the tattoos because I had never dated a guy with tattoos.'

Suddenly romantic about the decision, Ayda said: 'There was something really divine that happened where all of the sudden...

'The universe opened up and I totally and completely understood who this man was and he totally and completely understood who I was [...] It was an electric moment. I felt like I'd known him my whole life.'

Speaking about how she has coped as a parent in lockdown, she said: 'There were definitely moments where I felt like I was in my groove and then moments where I thought I was the worst parent in the world.'

Nice! His inkings caught Ayda's eye as she said: 'I was super impressed by the tattoos because I had never dated a guy with tattoos'

She also spoke about breastfeeding: 'What I did find really intimidating was the breastfeeding immediately [...] I thought that would just be really natural and normal [...] You just plonk them on!'

Recalling Robbie's shock comments when Theodora was born, she went on: 'And do you know what that naughty popstar did?...

'He had some work to do; he had to leave the next day [...] And I get home from the hospital, I guess he's done Graham Norton, right? But he's not warned me about what he's said...

Their loves: The happy couple share Theodora, eight, Charlton, five, Colette, two, and seven-month-old Beau, whose arrival was a surprise to fans on Valentine's Day (pictured in June)

'And in the interview, I'm literally sitting with Teddy, just home from the hospital and we're watching Daddy on Graham Norton [...] They ask him about the birth and he says 'It was like watching his favourite pub burn down'.'

Ayda also revealed she feared she was suffering with postpartum depression: 'It was a wonderful time, but a really low time because I felt so physically depleted.'

'I had the fears in me, I don't know if it was post-partum [...] But it was that thing where I was really worried something was going to happen to her.'
