He's known to speak his mind when critiquing the room reveals on The Block.

And judge Darren Palmer issued a savage assessment of two bathrooms from competing teams on Sunday night's episode.

The interior design guru found the wall structure of Harry and Tash's bathroom to be concerning, before admitting to 'not liking anything' about Daniel and Jade's tiling. 

'It's a screw up!' The Block judge Darren Palmer (far left) issued a SAVAGE assessment of Harry and Tash's bathroom - before screwing his nose up at Daniel and Jade's tiling choices (pictured) on Sunday night's episode 

Sunday's episode saw the five teams choosing to style two rooms, one of which had to be a bathroom.  

Harry and Tash's 1920's bedroom started off on a positive note with all three judges, however their ensuite was a very different story.  

While Darren, Shaynna Blaze and Neale Whitaker were in awe of the colour palette and basin choice, Darren noticed a structural nightmare in builders having erected a straight frame crooked.

'It's a screw up! It's sad that an error like that can undo all of this hard work, especially in this stressful environment,' he said. 

Darren was also vocal when it came to assessing Daniel and Jade's 1930's bathroom. 

He was in awe of both kids' bedrooms they had styled moments prior, however he admitted to 'pretty much [not liking] all' of their bathroom.

'These three choices fight against each other': However, when it came to their bathroom, he criticised the use of three different tiles in the space. Pictured: Daniel and Jade 

Referencing the three different tiles used, he said: 'When you pair that, with that tile, it's two different feelings. The concrete, the marble and then this. These three choices fight against each other.' 

Darren also found fault in missing structural detail on the towel rail and gaps above the tiles on the walls.      

Meanwhile, for Sarah and George's 1940's bedroom and bathroom, it was all positive.

High note: Meanwhile, for Sarah and George's 1940's bedroom (pictured), it was all positive. Judge Neale Whitaker described it as 'breathtaking' with its sweeping ceiling and wall art 

No faults here: All three judges commended the couple for their 'quilt-look' tiling in the bathroom (pictured) and the 'spectacular' lighting 

All smiles: Sarah and George (pictured) were no doubt happy with the feedback

All three judges commended the couple for their 'quilt-look' tiling in the bathroom and the 'spectacular' lighting. 

There were no faults in Luke and Jasmin's 1910-themed children's room and ensuite.

Success: There were also no faults in Luke and Jasmin's 1910-themed children's room (pictured) and ensuite 

Winners: Luke and Jasmin (pictured) won this week's room reveal on 30 points 

Shaynna praised the couple for constructing a children's play area above the bed, while Neale and Darren described the room as a 'cute' space.

The judges were also in awe of the bathroom with its mustard and timber tones, with Neale gazing over the 'stunning colour palette'.   

It started off well for Jimmy and Tam with their 1950's bedroom, with Shaynna gushing over the wardrobe space.

He's impressed: Neale also adored their show-stopping feature wall (pictured) 

However, when it came to their bathroom in a bright peach and stone colour palette, the judges were concerned that it was too outside of the box.

'This is the hi-vis of bathrooms,' Darren joked, while Shaynna added that it's important to not be 'too niche' when attracting potential buyers.   

The episode saw Luke and Jasmin winning the room reveal with 30 points, followed by a tie on 29 with Sarah and George, and Jimmy and Tam.

Daniel and Jade placed third on 25-and-a-half points, and Harry and Tash on 23-and-a-half.  

The Block continues Monday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine

Too niche? However, when it came to their bathroom in a bright peach and stone colour palette, the judges were concerned that it was too outside of the box
