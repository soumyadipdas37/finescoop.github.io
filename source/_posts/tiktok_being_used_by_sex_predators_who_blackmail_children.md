Sex predators are targeting young children on popular social media app TikTok and blackmailing them into sending nude images and videos.

There has been a damning increase in online child sex abuse particularly during lockdown as kids remain inside on their phones.

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) have already arrested 161 disgusting predators and saved 134 children from abuse this year alone.

Detective Sergeant Daisie Beckensall said grooming is popular on social media apps like TikTok and Facebook, including gaming sites.

She explained that before the grooming process, the stranger pretends to be the child's friend before threatening to blackmail them. 

'We see a lot of friend requests from online predators looking for children to follow, and the children will usually follow them back,' she told The Herald Sun.  

'They start chatting online – they build up a rapport with the child, it starts off as an innocent and friendly chat, then they ask, ''Send me a photo of yourself''.'

As the paedophiles pretend to be of similar age to the children they're grooming, they also first ask for innocent photos.

Soon after, they become more demanding asking for sexualised images and threatening to tell the children's parents if they stop sending photos. 

'Once the predators have the photos, they use them to manipulate and put fear into kids.'

Detective Beckensall also said another worrying trend was children posting naked photos and videos of themselves because they think it is 'normal' after seeing it online.

With some students still studying at home, they might not be privy to the 'scrutiny' as they would if at school. 

She said it is important that parents tell their children to come forward if they are being bullied.

If someone is contacting your child and this contact is unwanted or makes them feel uncomfortable, here are some things you can do to help.
