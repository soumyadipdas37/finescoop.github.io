Manchester United are considering Watford's Ismaila Sarr as an alternative should they fail to make a breakthrough on Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho.

Sarr, 22, has been on Liverpool's shortlist and is rated around £45m by the Championship side.

United are running out of time in the window and have not made a breakthrough with Sancho

 Sarr, 22, has been on Liverpool 's shortlist and is rated around £45m by the Championship side

Sarr has impressed at Watford since his £25m move from Rennes last year but was unable to save the club from relegation to the second tier.

The winger played the full 90 minutes as Watford beat Luton in their first game of the new season on Saturday.

Sportsmail revealed on Sunday United were considering alternatives if their latest ploy to tempt Sancho away did not come to fruition.

And he could be an option if United's latest ploy to tempt Dortmund into selling Sancho fails

Dortmund have been adamant in recent weeks that the £108million-rated England international will stay with them for the season.

But should they fail to tempt Dortmund into selling with their offer of around £65m plus achievable add ons up to £90m, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will revert to alternatives.

Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik, Bournemouth's Josh King, Ivan Perisic of Inter Milan and Douglas Costa of Juventus have all been discussed, and now it appears Sarr - who was reportedly close to a move to Liverpool earlier this month - has joined that list.

The pressure is on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and United to deliver before the window slams shut

Meanwhile, AC MIlan have asked about taking United defender Diogo Dalot on loan.

United would prefer an outright sale for the Portugal Under 21 international. Milan have also discussed Tottenham's Serge Aurier and Max Aarons of Norwich.

United midfielder Andreas Pereira is also expected to finalise his loan move to Lazio this week. 

Talks are continuing over the deal with the option to make the transfer permanent for £25m.
