Reg Harrison - the oldest living FA Cup winner - has passed away at the age of 97, it has been confirmed.

The former winger lifted the trophy with Derby County back in 1946 following their 4-1 victory against Charlton at Wembley in the first FA Cup final since the second World War. 

But as first reported by The Times, Harrison died at around 9pm on Thursday night surrounded by family in the bungalow he had lived in for 54 years.

Harrison spent 11 years with Derby between 1944 and 1955, scoring 59 goals in 281 appearances for a club he had joined at the age of 16.

He then decided to end his playing career with short spells at Lancashire side Boston United and Derbyshire outfit Long Eaton United.  

But his most accomplished day in the game came aged 22 as he helped Stuart McMillan's side to the 4-1 victory over The Latics at the Old Wembley.

Harrison also had a brief managerial career after deciding to hand up his boots with former side Long Eaton.

However, his focus soon shifted to helping out young people in his hometown by setting up centres.

In February 2019, he was awarded Freedom of the City for services to the community by Derby City Council.
