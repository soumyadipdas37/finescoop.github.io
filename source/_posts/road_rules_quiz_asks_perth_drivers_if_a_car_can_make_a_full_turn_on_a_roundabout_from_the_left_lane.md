Perth drivers have been put to the test with a road rules quiz asking if a driver can make a full U-turn at a roundabout while using the left hand lane. 

The question was posted on Facebook by Transport WA on Tuesday with an image showing a red car in the left lane indicating to make a full turn on the roundabout.  

The arrows underneath the car indicate that the vehicle can only turn left or continue straight on the roundabout.

'Is the red car legally allowed to make a full turn on the roundabout from their position in the left lane?' WA Transport asked.

According to the road rules, drivers are not allowed to make a full turn at a multi-lane roundabout.

They can only use the left lane to turn off at the first exit or to go straight ahead.

Now share your opinion

The majority of residents got the question right, saying it was not was legal for the car to make the full turn. 

'No they can't from the left lane, only from the right lane,' one person wrote. 

'I'm going with no. They should be in the right lane and indicate left 90 degrees prior to exit,' another commented. 

'It would depend on the markings and signage at the roundabout. In this case no,' someone else wrote. 

'No. That lane is marked for left turns and straight on only. To complete a U turn at this roundabout, they would need to enter the roundabout in the right lane,' another commented. 

Other social media users joked that Perth drivers don't follow road rules and would make the illegal turn.

'Of course they can...So long as they give you the ''my bad'' wave after they cut you off,' one joked. 

'Hell yeah, just chuck the hazards on and everyone will move,' another commented.
