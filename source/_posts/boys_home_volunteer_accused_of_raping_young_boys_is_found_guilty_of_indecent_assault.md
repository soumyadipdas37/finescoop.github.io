A boys' home volunteer accused of sexually assaulting and raping young children in his care has been found guilty of two charges of indecent assault by a Sydney jury.

The man in his 60s, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to five of 26 historical charges, including one count of buggery.

He stood trial in the District Court for the remaining 21 charges, including four counts of buggery, some of which occurred in the 1970s and 1980s at numerous foster homes

The jury was directed to find verdicts of not guilty for two of the charges, and returned further verdicts of not guilty for the remaining 13 charges.

He had admitted sexually assaulting one boy at his parents' home in Sydney's inner west after he was regularly given permission to take children out for day and weekend leave.

Charges were laid after he made an admission of sexually assaulting a young boy to an undercover police officer posing as his victim in 2018.

During the phone call he admitted a number of sexual assaults, but denied other incidents the police officer raised.

The matter is due for sentence hearing on November 20.
