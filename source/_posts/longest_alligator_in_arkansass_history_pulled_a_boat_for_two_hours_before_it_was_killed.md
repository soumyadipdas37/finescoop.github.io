The longest alligator to be killed in Arkansas's history dragged a boat around for two hours before it was slain.

 Travis Bearden spotted the 13ft 11.5in, 800lb alligator while hunting with his father Gary, brother Cody and friend Tommy Kelley on Lake Merrisach. 

The four men were hunting on the last weekend permitted on Travis's licence this year on Saturday when they harpooned the beast.

They had been hunting the previous weekend but were unsuccessful, making the catch even more exciting. 

It pulled their boat around the lake for two hours before Travis got a clean shot and the men used a forklift truck to pull the animal into the air for photos.

In startling footage, the alligator is hoisted up by the forklift as it reverses on dry land.

The animal is nearly as long as the truck's extended mast, dangling in the air by its neck with its tail brushing the floor.

Travis told 5News: 'We weren’t real sure how big he was when we spotted him, and to our surprise after we harpooned it, it ended up being a giant.

'It [dragged] the boat around for almost 2 hours before I was able to get a clean shot on it. Having my dad and my brother there made it that much more special.

'I just sat back and listened to my dad tell stranger after stranger the story. I think he might be more excited than I am.'

Trey Reid from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission confirmed the catch the longest alligator harvested since Arkansas has had an alligator season.

The longest alligator previously harvested in Arkansas was 1.5in shorter at 13ft 10in and more than 1,380lb. 

After the catch, Travis wrote on Facebook: 'The new state record for Arkansas. 

'I've got to give a shoutout to everyone that played a huge part in me being able to harvest such a giant. 

'God for blessing me with the opportunity, my wife for being so supportive of me being gone these last two weekends, and all my family and friends for the help along the way. I can’t stop smiling.'
