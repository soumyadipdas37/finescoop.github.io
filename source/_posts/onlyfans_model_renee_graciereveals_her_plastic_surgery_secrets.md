OnlyFans queen Renee Gracie has amassed almost a million followers online with her raunchy photos and videos. 

And the 25-year-old certainly didn't hold back when revealing her plastic surgery secrets on Thursday. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Renee said she didn't think there was anything wrong with going under the knife.

'I love surgery, I think it's great,' the busty brunette said proudly, admitting to getting filler in her lips along with a breast augmentation.

Renee said she gained lots of confidence after getting a boob job about 'seven or eight' years ago. 

'I was a total prude, I never sent nudes to anyone, I hadn't even kissed anyone, I was really shy,' Renee said of her pre-surgery personality. 

Changes: 'I was a total prude, I never sent nudes to anyone, I hadn't even kissed anyone, I was really shy,' Renee (pictured) said, prior to the surgery

After the surgery, however, Renee said it opened up a whole new world. 

'I got my boobs done because I purely wasn't happy with how I looked. I didn't do it for anyone, I didn't have a boyfriend at the time, I literally just did it for me.' 

Renee said 'the way she felt about herself' after the procedure made her believe she would never tell anyone not to feel that way. 

Plump pout: 'I got lip filler in my lips and same thing. Someone made a comment that I had a small top lip, so I got self-conscious about it,' Renee (pictured) said 

Renee has previously admitted to a Brazilian butt lift. The former sportswoman also got her lips done a couple of years ago.  

'I got lip filler in my lips and same thing. Someone made a comment that I had a small top lip, so I got self-conscious about it. 

'So I did it for myself...It was the best thing I ever did. I get it done once or twice a year still. I would never stop someone getting that feeling of satisfaction.' 

Open minded: Renee (pictured) believed it was important for people to get 'all the surgery they need' in order to feel good about themselves

Renee believed it was important for people to get 'all the surgery they need' in order to feel good about themselves. 'If it's going to make you feel better, I would never say no.'

Despite only having an OnlyFans account for less than a year, Renee has already earned more than a million dollars.  

She will soon host a Content Day event, where she'll teach fans how to make money from selling their raunchy photos online.

Her course will include lessons on copyright law and making sure that your content isn't distributed by third parties without permission.

'There are laws about leaked pornography,' Renee said. 'If somebody posts a sexual photo of you, naked or not, it is illegal in most countries.

'I am now confident enough to give advice to girls about stuff I have unfortunately been though. There are things that are so important to know.'
