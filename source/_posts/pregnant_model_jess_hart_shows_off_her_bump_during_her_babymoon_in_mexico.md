Jessica Hart is enjoying a 'babymoon' holiday inÂ Mexico with her boyfriend, James Kirkham, as they await the arrival of their first child together.

And the 34-year-old model shared a video toÂ Instagram on Wednesday of herself flaunting her burgeoningÂ bump at the beach inÂ Cabo San Lucas.

The expectant mother looked glowing as she wiggled her hips and boasted that she had her own private beach for the next week.

'OOUURR BEACH for the next seven days #babymoon,' theÂ former Victoria's Secret model wrote in the caption.

In the video, she danced and giggled in a bikini, before playfully adjusting her tortoiseshell sunglasses and kissing NASCAR driver James.
