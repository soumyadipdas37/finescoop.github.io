They released their new music for their single Holiday last month.

Perrie Edwards, 27, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, 28, Jade Thirlwall, 27, and Jesy Nelson, 29, slipped into bikinis as they filmed the underwater-themed short in front of a green screen.

Revealing how they achieved the subaquatic look, the band members worked their angles in front of the screen to appear like they were submerged under water.

Part of the set was built up with rocks and other sea life, while a tinsel covered tree was positioned behind Jade in one particularly glitzy scene.

Perrie looked stunning in a quirky ruched bikini top, which was teamed with a pair of skimpy bottoms.

She wore her blonde locks in mermaid-esque waves and swept them up off her face into a ponytail.

In one shot, Leigh-Anne relaxed on a chaise lounge in a stylish asymmetric bikini, teamed with a pair of matching bikini bottoms with silver buckle detailing.

She wore her brunette locks scraped back into a high ponytail, which was plaited and cascaded down her back as she danced away to the music.

One of the highlighted of the film is when the four women dress up as mermaids, donning glistening fish tails and a metallic bask.

While elsewhere they writhed in the sand on the bed of the ocean.

Following the release of the behind-the-scenes snaps, the band joined Amanda Holden and Jamie Theakston to discuss their new album on Heart Breakfast. 

Jesy revealed the release will probably be close to Christmas, and explained: 'We've done the artwork, we've done everything for it now, so it's literally just a matter of time isn't it' 

Admitting to her nerves surrounding the situation, Leigh-Anne said: 'I'm not going to lie though, I am a little bit nervous about releasing it during this time, like, it's just so weird and I just hope that we get to go places.'

They later joined Roman Kemp on Capital FM and talked about their new talent show The Search and Jesy confidently admitted it was the 'best thing' she had ever seen on television.  

She said: 'It's just so fun and funny and entertaining, it's different, I don't feel like there's anything that's ever been done like this before, the whole format, us as judges.'

Discussing who they thought was the 'toughest' judge, the girls that admitted that Jesy was, but it a 'good way', while Perrie offers 'good technical advice'.  

Perrie said: 'In all fairness you would say that because you were there in the moment, a lot of it got cut, a lot of the not so good people got cut, and that's when I was probably a little bit more harsh.'
