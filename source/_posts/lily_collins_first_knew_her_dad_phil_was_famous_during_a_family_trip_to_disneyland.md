She's the daughter of Genesis star Phil Collins.

And Lily Collins admitted she first realised the level of her father's fame when they were on a family trip to Disneyland when she was a child, and she saw a man had the music icon's face on his t-shirt. 

Speaking candidly to Radio Times on Tuesday, the actress, 31, reminisced: 'I was being carried on my dad’s shoulders when this man started to walk towards us. 

Stardom: Lily Collins said on Tuesday she first knew her dad Phil was famous on a family trip to Disneyland when they met a fan who had the musician's face on his top (pictured in 2012)

'He had my dad’s face on his T-shirt and I didn’t quite get it. Then he saw my dad and asked for a photo — and it was a really weird moment. 

'I was thinking, “Why does he want a picture of my dad, and why is my dad on his T-shirt?”. Slowly but surely, I started to understand.'

Lily is the daughter of Phil's second wife Jill Tavelman, who he was married to from 1984 to 1996 following extramarital affairs during the drummer's Genesis tour in 1992 with Lavinia Laing.

Amusing Lily (pictured in Emily in Paris) admitted, 'I was thinking, “Why does he want a picture of my dad, and why is my dad on his T-shirt?”. Slowly but surely, I started to understand'

The Emily In Paris star went on to claim that she'd 'stay away' from starring in a biopic about her dad, as she wouldn't want to mix her personal and professional life.

She explained: 'I think I would want to keep that part of my life separate, but I’d be really fascinated to find out who they’d choose to play him.'

Lily added that her father is 'very proud' of her work as he loves her being an actor, and he is often 'super excited' whenever she gets cast in a new project. 

Lily revealed her beau Charlie McDowell had proposed to her during a trip to Sedona, New Mexico, earlier this month.

Her engagement comes after just one year of dating the The One I Love filmmaker, 37.

The actress took to Instagram on Friday to share the happy news alongside images of the couple kissing and the moment he proposed during a romantic date.
