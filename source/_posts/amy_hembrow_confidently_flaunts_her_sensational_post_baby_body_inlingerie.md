New mother Amy Hembrow recently revealed that she's become more body confident since welcoming her daughter five months ago.

And on Friday, the blonde bombshell, who is the eldest sister of fitness mogul Tammy Hembrow, proudly flaunted her post-baby body on Instagram.

The 30-year-old stripped down to a grey lingerie trimmed with white straps and bands, from underwear label Lounge Underwear.

She posed in the mirror for a selfie showing off her trim figure as her white track pants clung to her hips.

Last week Amy revealed that she's never felt more body confident since giving birth to her daughter.

In another photo shared online, she stripped down into a mocha coloured lingerie set by Lounge Underwear that put her best assets on display.

The Gold Coast-based businesswoman wrote in the caption: 'I don't think I've ever felt more comfortable in my own skin.'

'Crazy to think that before Aurora I was so self conscious but during my pregnancy I felt more confident every day, I think it's my new appreciation for my body and what it's gone through,' she added. 

Amy and her fiancé, Rory Carmody, welcomed Aurora on April 14.

In an Instagram post at the time, she shared her water birthing experience and said she had always wanted to stay at home for as long as possible before going to the hospital.

'I laboured at home from 1am until 7am, and then that's when my midwife said that I should come in [to the hospital].'

Amy said she 'chose not to know' how dilated she was during the labour, because she didn't want to get 'disheartened' if she still had a long way to go.

She was in the shower when she 'transitioned into the final stretch' of her labour, and was then 'asked to get into the water bath', where she listened to a playlist of Nick Cave songs and positive affirmations.

Amy was in the bath for just two hours before her daughter was born. In the room with her was her fiancé Rory and her younger sister Starlette Thynne.

Mother and daughter returned home later that day after their health check-ups.
