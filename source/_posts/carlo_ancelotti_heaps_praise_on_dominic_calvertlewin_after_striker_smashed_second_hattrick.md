Carlo Ancelotti heaped praise on Dominic Calvert-Lewis after the striker scored his second hat-trick of the season to progress Everton through to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup. 

Ancelotti said the 23-year-old was 'on fire' after opening the scoring against West Ham in the 11th minute of the game, before finding the next again in the 78th and 84th minute. 

Calvert-Lewis' performance will have given England manager Gareth Southgate a timely reminder of his talents before he selects his squad for this month's international triple header on Thursday.

'He is doing a fantastic job in the moment, he is really on fire and scoring a lot of goals,' Ancelotti said of the 23-year-old.

'He's in a very good moment. Whether he's the best (English striker) I don't know, but I don't care. For me, for us, he is.'

Fans were of the same opinion as the Everton manager and took to social media to praise Calvert-Lewis' efforts. 

One Twitter user joked that Calvert-Lewis drew similarities to Ronaldo, writing: 'Dominic Calvert Lewin should take off the mask now we know it's you Ronaldo.'

While another added: 'Calvert-Lewin is the best striker in Liverpool.' 







Victory may have come at a cost however, as Richarlison hobbled off shortly after firing Everton back in front in the 56th minute, while there were also problems for Allan and Jonjoe Kenny.

Ancelotti played down those injuries, but admitted Allan and Kenny may now miss Saturday's game against Brighton.

'Richarlison has a twist on his ankle but I think it's not so bad,' Ancelotti said. 'Allan had a muscle problem and Kenny a twist on his ankle. We have to check them tomorrow but it seems no so bad...

'Richarlison I think can recover for Saturday, Allan and Kenny will be more difficult.'

The win extended Everton's perfect start to the season to six games in all competitions, and they will be taken seriously in Thursday's quarter-final draw as they seek their first silverware since 1995.

Ancelotti continued: 'We have started really well. It was not a surprise because I think that his squad has a lot of quality.

'We were able to adapt very well with the new signings but the others came back with different ambitions and different motivations so now we are doing well.'

Richarlison, on the other hand, was hurt trying to tackle Ben Johnson and later hobbled off
