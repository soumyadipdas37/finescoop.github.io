'Baby boy/girl we are so excited for the arrival of your presence,' she began.

'My sister nicknamed my bump Rupert. Sophie was Bambi and I'm certainly feeling a lot bigger this pregnancy,' she continued.   

Tahlia added that she was spending as much quality time with her first daughter, Sophie, before she becomes a big sister.

'Looking forward to this years family holiday in the NRL off season, for a few days of beach, sun and family time,' she later added.

She had her long locks pushed back behind her hair and went makeup free. 

Tahlia announced her second pregnancy last month, posting a photo of herself as she showed off her bump with Tom and their one-year-old daughter, Sophie.
