The presenter described how he almost turned his back on showbiz after being rejected from the children's series.  

The star told how he 'briefly considered' following the career of his brother, Father Dermott Donnelly, who even conducted Dec's wedding to Ali Astall in 2015. 

In an extract, according to The Mirror, from his first autobiography with Ant, Ooh! What a Lovely Pair, he wrote: 'After that crushing rejection, I made a momentous decision: that was it - I was going to retire from acting. I was eleven.' 

And Dec, who is the youngest of seven children, described how he contemplated turning to religion after his audition didn't go to plan. 

He continued: 'Later on, when I was about fourteen, I did briefly consider following in his footsteps, and the footsteps of my Godfather, Father O'Connell, and becoming a priest.'
