'It was sad. It feels like a break-up almost because you develop such strong relationships with the cast with the crew and you get to do incredible things that you probably never get to experience without the show,' she told her followers on Instagram. 

John Mellencamp's daughter joined the West Coast franchise three years ago during season eight which aired between December 2017 and May 2018.

'That being said, I'm really looking forward to the future and being able to focus on my family, my friends, all in,' she added. 'I really feel like I have some exciting things ahead. And you know what? I'm pretty busy with this little nugs! So thanks a lot for coming on this journey with me and I'll see you soon!' 

'You are so smart, kind , thoughtful, funny & real. I look forward to witnessing what the universe has in store for you next. I know it's going to be amazing. You deserve it all. Cheers,' Kyle wrote to her friend

Last season: Teddi starred alongside Garcelle Beauvais, Denise Richards, Lisa Rinna, Erika Girardi and Dorit Kemsley in season 10

Former housewife Lisa Vanderpump took to her podcast All Things Vanderpump and addressed Teddi's departure from the show. 

When asked why she thought Teddi had been fired by Bravo execs, Lisa said: 'I don't know, people said because she was boring.

'I certainly didn't have a good experience with her, so boring would be one of the nicer things that I could say.' 

Lisa, for her part, left the show in season nine amid a fall out with former friends Kyle Richards and Dorit Kemsley.
