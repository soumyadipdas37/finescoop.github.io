Billie Piper has reportedly starred in the longest solo sex scene on British TV with her character in I Hate Suzie pleasuring herself for seven minutes and four seconds. 

The actress, 37, is seen fantasising about men and a woman as she self-pleasures on her bed in the Sky Atlantic series. 

Billie, who stars as the title character and co-wrote the series with playwright Lucy Prebble, 'was determined to show women doing it for themselves', a source told The Sun.

In episode four of the series Suzie is also seen taking the batteries out of her son Frank's robot for her sex toy. 

The source told the publication that it is 'not often' women are seen on TV 'enjoying themselves' 'solo'. 

They added: 'So frankly it makes a refreshing change to see such a long and animated scene like this one.'

It comes as BBC's Normal People featured over 41 minutes of amorous action across its 12 episodes with one episode showing 11 minutes of sex between stars Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal. 

The show follows Suzie as she slowly begins to unravel after the photos are published, the effects of which ricochet into every area of her life.  

As the episodes go on, the audience follows Suzie as she goes through stages of shock, denial, fear, shame, guilt, anger and eventually, acceptance.

Suzie is seen in the programme enjoying family life with her husband and child before this is interspersed with the horror she feels when she learns the secret images of her have been made public.

As the fallout continues, Suzie and her best friend and manager Naomi (Leila Farzad) try to hold her life, career and marriage to Cob (Daniel Ings) together. 

The singer-turned-actress burst onto the pop scene back in 1998 at the tender age of 15 with her debut chart-topping hit Because We Want To.

The mother-of-three has looked back over those days in I Hate Suzie.

Earlier this month, she told the Radio Times of tapping into her character: 'I know exactly what that feels like and I’m sure it feeds into my performance. I’m only coming to terms with a lot of it right now.  

'In my 20s a lot of my stress from that period was buried, and I still struggle to remember a lot of it. I don’t regret it. I love what I do and where I’m at personally.

'But I certainly wouldn’t want my children to go that way. There’s an anxiety of me as a child that I probably on some levels smother my children with.' 

Billie shares sons Winston, 11, and Eugene, eight, with ex-husband Laurence Fox, and has 19-month-old daughter Tallulah with Johnny Lloyd.
