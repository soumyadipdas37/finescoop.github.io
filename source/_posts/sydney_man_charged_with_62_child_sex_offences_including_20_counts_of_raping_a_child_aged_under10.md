A man is behind bars charged with 62 vile sexual assault offences against four children and a woman. 

The breakthrough in the case comes almost three years after detectives in Sydney's south-west launched an investigation into allegations the five victims were sexually assaulted by a man known to them between 1995 and 2012.

Detectives arrested a man, 43, at a home in nearby Rosemeadow on Monday morning.

Other charges included seven counts of aggravated sex assault and five counts of aggravated indecent assault of a minor aged under-16, two counts of assault with act of indecency and one count of sexual intercourse without consent.
