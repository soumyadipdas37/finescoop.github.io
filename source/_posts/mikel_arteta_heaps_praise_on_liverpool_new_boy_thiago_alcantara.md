Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes new Liverpool signing Thiago Alcantara is 'very special'.

The Reds purchased Thiago from Bayern Munich for a deal worth £25million earlier this month and made his debut in Liverpool's 2-0 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last weekend.

Arteta was speaking at his pre-match press conference as his side face two trips to Anfield with the first coming in the Premier League on Monday night.

Asked if Arsenal tried to sign Thiago, Arteta said: 'We don't discuss the things we try and do in the market, but I like him from my time in Barcelona.

'Incredible personality, great talent, very special, great qualities to play in midfield and yes, I think he is a great signing for Liverpool.'

Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will miss Monday's visit of Arsenal as he has not fully recovered from the knock which forced him off at half-time of Sunday's win at Chelsea.

The absence of the England midfielder increases the chance of a first start for new signing Thiago, who was Henderson's replacement at Stamford Bridge.

Klopp also received some good news with Joe Gomez set to return to training to give him the option of restoring his first-choice centre-back partnership, having been forced to play midfielder Fabinho there last weekend.

'Joe should be back today in training. Billy the Kid (17-year-old centre-back Billy Koumetio) is back in training. Joel (Matip) is not. Hendo is not yet, this game is for sure too early.'

New arrival Thiago impressed after he replaced Henderson at Stamford Bridge, and Jurgen Klopp hinted that he could make his first start for the Reds.

'We will see. We have a few days to train, some boys have to recover so we will see how we set up. 

'I have an idea but we time until Monday. He (Thiago) is in contention for sure. Let's see.'
