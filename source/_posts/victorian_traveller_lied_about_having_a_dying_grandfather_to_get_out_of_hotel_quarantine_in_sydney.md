A man from coronavirus-stricken Victoria allegedly lied about having a terminally ill grandfather so he could leave hotel quarantine in Sydney early.

The man, 30, arrived at Sydney Airport on September 4 without an exemption.

Authorities took the man to hotel quarantine, where he was to isolate for 14 days at his own expense.

However, the following day the man allegedly claimed to have documents stating he had a valid exemption.

The exemption claimed that he was in Sydney to visit his terminally ill grandfather and he was then allowed to leave hotel quarantine, police say.

NSW Police later determined that the man's grandfather was not in hospital.

Police arrested the man in Penrith, western Sydney, and charged him with failure to comply with a noticed direction in relation to COVID-19 and producing a false or misleading document.

The man was returned to hotel quarantine.

He will face Penrith Local Court on October 12.
