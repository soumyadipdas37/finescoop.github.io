The founder of a popular burger chain has slammed a video showing partygoers dancing shoulder to shoulder while his restaurants are crippled by COVID-19 social distancing rules.  

Milky Lane's Christian Avant shared footage showing revellers dancing at a Burleigh Heads park, on the Gold Coast, on Sunday night.

Hundreds of people are seen stomping their feet and waving their arms into the air to the beat of bongos as fire twirlers perform just metres away.

Mr Avant, who has a store at Surfers Paradise, accused authorities of double standards as he claimed a restaurant owner would have been fined thousands of dollars if they allowed as many people into their venue.  

'I'm all for people having fun but there seems to be different sets of rules for different scenarios,' he posted on Facebook. 

'I have friends that own bars, clubs and venues where if one single person dances or stands up, you get a heavy fine.'

Queensland has placed restrictions on cafes, restaurants and pubs to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

1) Venues that are smaller than 200 squared metres are limited to 50 patrons at one time.

2) Patrons can order and pay for their food at the counter but must be seated when eating their food.

3) Venues must keep the contact details of their patrons for 56 days.

4) Anyone who breaches health rules risks a $4,000 fine and six months imprisonment.

'But hundreds of people dancing side-by-side to bongos in a park gets past every current law and rule set by the Queensland Government.'

Venues that are smaller than 200 square metres are limited to one person per two square metres.

Restaurants must also keep the contact details of patrons for 56 days.

Fines of up to $4,000 and six months imprisonment can be handed out to anyone found in breach of health rules.

Mr Avant said the restrictions were badly damaging businesses.

'Let's even for a second look beyond the COVID virus factor and go into the current rulings and regulations around it,' he said.

'I'm still only allowed 30 per cent capacity at my Milky Lane restaurants and it's HEAVILY policed. 'We've probably lost $500k-1m in potential revenue due to the limitations during COVID.'

Mr Avant called for the Queensland Government to revise its restrictions for businesses.

'If things like this are 'allowed', then the state needs to open up and let hospitality operators have a piece of the pie too.' 

Daily Mail Australia contacted Queensland Police for comment.
