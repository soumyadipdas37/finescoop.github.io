Doctor Who fans may be forced to wait until 2022 for the new series after filming was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sources claimed the BBC sci-fi may not be ready in time for its planned air date in 2021, though this year's Christmas Special has already been filmed and will be broadcast as scheduled.

Doctor Who last appeared on screens in March as fans were floored to learn that the titular Time Lady's history had been a complete lie, with Jodie Whittaker's incarnation of the character stunned to learn she had thousands of hidden incarnations.

A source told The Mirror: 'Shooting safely is a slow process. If there is a series finished and ready to go next year it will be nothing short of a miracle.'

However a BBC insider went onto insist that bosses are optimistic filming can go ahead as planned and the new series can air in 2021.

They told the publication: 'Filming is going ahead as planned and we remain hopeful that the next series will air in 2021.'

It's thought that this year's Christmas Special, titled Revolution of the Daleks, was filmed before the COVID-19 outbreak and will air as planned over the festive season.

It's thought the special will be the final appearance for Bradley Walsh as Graham O'Brien and Tosin Cole as Ryan Sinclair.

Mandeep Gill is expected to remain on the show as Yasmin Khan and will continue to appear alongside The Doctor in the planned 13th series.

Currently filming for the new series is scheduled to begin next month, after production on a range of shows was delayed by the crisis.

Line Of Duty recently announced that filming had resumed on series six after being halted during the outbreak, while Call The Midwife have also confirmed production has resumed.

Doctor Who's last series ended on a shocking cliffhanger as the titular time traveller was transported to a mysterious alien spaceship.

She had just learned that her entire history on Gallifrey had been a lie, and she had also been the origin of her species' method of regeneration.
