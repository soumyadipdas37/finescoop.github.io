Scout Willis was on the go on Wednesday as she was seen taking care of errands around the city.

The 29-year-old daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis opted for a casual ensemble that highlighted her toned legs.

She wore a muted off-white sweatshirt with frayed cuffs which she tucked into her gray–blue jean shorts, which she rolled up slightly.

Scout added some extra style to the look with light brown loafers and simple white socks.

She contrasted the muted colors of her clothing with a floppy red handbag she carried under one arm, which matched the long red tassels on her keychain.

The celebrity daughter wore her raven locks parted down the middle and let them flutter about in the breeze.

She did her part to help slow the spread of the coronavirus by wearing a sky blue mask with clouds on it, in accordance with California Governor Gavin Newsom's order that Californians wear masks in all public places.

The day before, Scout urged her 204K Instagram followers to take part in the upcoming November election.

She posted a photo of a drawing of a man with extra arms and legs that was humorously titled Multitasking to show that people could check their voter registration status while they 'casually scroll through Instagram.'

'Don’t let this be the year you don’t make your voice heard, speak up for what you believe in, like this guy with all the extra limbs,' she wrote.

'If you celebrated national sibling day, national dog day or any of the associated days that people have randomly assigned as smol social media holidays you can definitely celebrate #nationalvoterregistrationday so you can proudly say #iamavoter and I support the environment, social equality and justice, immigrants, women's sovereignty over their bodies, the list goes on and on, so SUPPORT SOMETHING!' she concluded.

'Part 2) I am delighted by what I see. Part 3) I buy tap shoes on Etsy.

'Prologue) does anyone want to teach me to tap dance over zoom?' she added.
