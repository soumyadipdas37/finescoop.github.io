Denise Welch was told to 'calm down' by Eamonn Holmes during a very heated on Friday's This Morning.

The Loose Women panelist, 62, appeared on the show to discuss coronavirius 'scaremongering' as she argued that the government was scaring people with their overreaction to Covid-19 numbers.

And things got very intense as host Eamonn, 60, was forced to ask Denise to take things down a notch as she got very passionate, while Piers Morgan later tweeted that Denise was 'dumb and dangerous'.

Appearing via video link in Portugal, Denise hit out at the government for frightening people over the coronavirus pandemic, with the presenter stating: 'I've never felt so passionate about anything in my life.'

Discussing the pandemic, Denise said: 'I'm not saying this is over. I'm not saying how horrendous this virus is and was.

'But at the moment we have a one in 2million chance of dying of Covid and I have a one in three chance of getting cancer. So can the government please tell us the proper statistics?'

The debate, which also included Dr Sara Kayat, saw Denise also talk about people's mental health and the fact that people who suffer from the likes of cancer and heart disease were failing to receive the treatment they needed. 

Turning to Dr Sara for her opinion, Eamonn said of Denise: 'She's not extremely right-ring on all of this.'

To which Denise immediately snapped: 'Extremely right-wing? I'm not remotely right-wing, Eamonn.'

With Denise's passion clearly showing through, Eamonn interjected: 'I'm only using your quote back at you, right? Just calm down, right?'

During the debate, the former Coronation Street star also criticised media coverage of positive coronavirus news as she questioned why days when 'nobody dies of a corona-related illness', it's not reported.

As Eamonn suggested that some of Denise's views may cause panic amongst viewers, she retorted: 'How am I causing panic, Eamonn?!' 

The debate also saw Ruth Langsford's Loose Women co-star take aim at fellow ITV presenter Piers Morgan, as she fumed: 'I'm a T-list celebrity according to megastar Piers Morgan.'

And it seemed that Piers was tuning into the discussion as he took to Twitter to share his thoughts on Denise's opinions.  

The Good Morning Britain host, 55, tweeted: 'Dumb, deluded & dangerous Covid-deniers like Denise Welch need to stop being given airtime.

'Her idiotic, ill-informed ramblings - from a woman who never stops telling us that she suffers from mental illness - will cost lives by persuading people to think the virus isn't a threat.'
