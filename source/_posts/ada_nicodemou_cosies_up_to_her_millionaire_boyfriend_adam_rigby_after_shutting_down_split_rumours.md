In July, she denied rumors that she had split from her millionaire boyfriend, Adam Rigby, 50. 

And on Friday, Home and Away star Ada Nicodemou enjoyed a date night with her man. 

The 43-year-old shared a sweet picture of the pair to Instagram, showing them cosying up together on their night out.

'Off on a date night,' Ada captioned the post, showing that she and her beau were still going strong.

Fans expressed their relief that the couple were still together, with one writing: 'Aww this photo makes me so happy. I thought you weren't together.'

In March, Woman's Day reported the pair had 'quietly split'. 

It came after Adam was slapped with an AVO in January, following an alleged incident with Ada's ex-husband, Chrys Xipolitas, on Christmas Day. 

At the time, a source claimed the stress of the AVO matter had taken its toll on the couple, resulting in their supposed break-up.

'Of course it's been stressful for Ada and Adam, she can't help but feel guilty Adam has been dragged into her messy personal life,' the insider said.    

Back in January, Woman's Day reported that Adam and Chrys had been involved in an alleged dispute on the doorstep of Ada's home on Christmas Day.

The exact reason for their argument is unknown.

Adam attended an AVO hearing at Sutherland Local Court that same month, after NSW Police took out a temporary AVO on behalf of Chrys.

A NSW Police spokesperson said: 'On Wednesday 8 January 2020 at Sutherland Local Court, a 50-year-old man [Adam] was served with a provisional Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) following an application by NSW Police.'

The AVO reportedly forbids Adam to destroy or damage property that belongs to Chrys. Breaking the AVO terms could result in imprisonment for up to two years and a maximum fine of $5,500.

Ada and Chrys split in 2016 after nine years of marriage. They share custody of a seven-year-old son, Johnas Xipolitas. 

The couple also experienced the heartache of a stillborn child in 2014.

Ada began dating Adam, whom she met at a work function, several months after her separation.

Adam is the CEO and founder of Upside Realty, a fixed-fee real estate agency.
