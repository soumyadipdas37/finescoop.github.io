Animal lover Drew Barrymore helped tend to an injured dog who appeared to be the victim of a hit and run incident in New York on Tuesday.

The newly-minted talk show host, 45,  tried to calm the canine down, petting it softly while also comforting the pup's owner.

Big heart: Drew Barrymore stopped her morning routine to help a dog who was injured by an apparent hit and run in NYC 

Barrymore stroked the whimpering pup's head while listening to the shocked owner.

The 50 First Dates actress - who was dressed down in comfy in a grey maxi-cardigan that skimmed the top of the actress' lambskin lined slippers - used her signature charm to cheer up the situation, coaxing a smile from the overwhelmed owner's face as they talked.

A nearby worker also stopped to help, offering a blanket and what looked like dog treats to the traumatized pet.

In her acceptance speech the former child actress opened up about the unique bond between humans and their animals, saying: 'You have a relationship with pets that is unspoken; it is without words. 

'And sure we could all deal with a little less words in a relationships sometimes. We should just follow the dogs!' she laughed.

'There is such profoundness in connectivity and energy and altruism that we have with our animals, especially rescue animals, and they feel it back. And there is some level of symbiotic gratitude because you do save each other.'
