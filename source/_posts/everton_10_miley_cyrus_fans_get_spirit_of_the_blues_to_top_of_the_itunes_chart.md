Everton may have been knocked off the top of the Premier League table by Leicester on Sunday evening, but they're still No 1 after fans took a 35-year-old club anthem to first place in the iTunes chart.

Following Saturday's 2-1 victory away at Crystal Palace, which made it three Premier League wins from three for Carlo Ancelotti's men, thrilled fans began buying Spirit of the Blues in their droves.

Available for 79p on iTunes, the club's official record from 1985 soon began shooting up the charts, rising more than 1,000 places in a matter of hours.

Everton's double-winning team of 1984-85 inspired the release of Spirit of the BluesÂ 

Spurred on by a social media movement which saw fans put the catchy tune over the top of clips from famous TV shows and movies, the song officially displaced American popstar Miley Cyrus' Midnight Sky as the UK's No 1 tune on Sunday night.

Supporters began the attempt to get Spirit of the Blues top after watching Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison strike to send their side above the Foxes in the Premier League table on Saturday afternoon.

Delighted with their winning start to the season, which has also seen Ancelotti's side defeat Salford and Fleetwood to reach the last 16 of the Carabao Cup, Evertonians dared to dream of a return to the glory days of the eighties.

Spirit of the Blues was released shortly after the Toffees completed a First Division title and European Cup Winners' Cup double during the 1984-85 season.

The song is still played before games at Goodison Park to this day - and it is now getting recognition on national radio after its rapid climb up the charts.

The popular tune was featured on Radio X's The Chris Moyles Show on Monday morning, with fans continuing to download it - and an album entitled Forever Everton - in huge numbers online.

The club's official Twitter account even got involved on Saturday evening, dubbing the song over a video of Yerry Mina and Richarlison enjoying a dance class with local children on Merseyside last season.

Everton will be looking to make it six wins from six games when they face West Ham in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night, before Brighton visit Goodison in the Premier League this weekend.Â
