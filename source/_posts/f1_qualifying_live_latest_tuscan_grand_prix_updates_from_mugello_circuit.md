Tuscan Grand Prix qualifying gets underway today as Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas look for 1-2 grid start on Mugello Circuit.

The championship-leading team were stunned last time out at Monza when AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly claimed his maiden F1 win of his career following a pit-lane penalty for Hamilton as he looked in complete control.Â Â 

All eyes will be on Ferrari after a difficult season and their woes could run deeper with another disaster in their own country this weekend.Â Â 

Sportsmail's KISHAN VAGHELA will provide live F1 qualifying coverage including lap times, fastest laps, pit stops and crashes.Â 

Host commentator

'We have to be realistic you need to be in Mercedes to win the Championship, but those two seats are taken. It is mostly the team and the spirit and potential.

'There is more to come from that team [Aston Martin next year] than people have seen so far from.'

Strong words from Sebastien Vettel on his move.

It's been a difficult season so far for Ferrari, who are suffering their worst season in 30 years.

They are set toÂ celebrate 1,000th race on home soil in Mugello, but how do they get back on track? Can it start with qualifying?

Those words would be something we haven't really mentioned this season, and much in the last few seasons due to his dominance.

But Mugello be the circuit that adds some uncertainty though?

It is full of full-bore curves and roller-coaster rises and dips is a challenge the world champion says he is still getting used to, calling it 'intense' before qualifying.

Hamilton has often pulled a result out of the bag when he needs to, but with Bottas practice results he will need to so again.

1. Valterri Bottas 1:16.350

2. Max Verstappen +0.017

3. Lewis Hamilton +0.083

4. Lance Stroll +0.582

5. Pierre Gasly +0.696

6. Sergio Perez +0.811

7. Charles Leclerc +0.958

8.Alex Albon +1.008

9. Danni Kvyat +1.097

10. Romain Grosjean +1.105

Max Verstappen looks like he will be the closest contender to Mercedes duo Bottas and Hamilton for position on the grid, particuarly after the former swept practice.

But while there is a fabulous setting for today's qualifying and Sunday's race, a narrow track could well prove to be a challenge for all three.

Hello and welcome.

There were some amazing scenes a few days ago with Pierre Gasly but we are now in Tuscany for qualifying for the first ever Tuscan Grand Prix.

With the Vettel news of a move to Aston Martin and Bottas' excellent display in practice so far, this promises to be another thriller.
