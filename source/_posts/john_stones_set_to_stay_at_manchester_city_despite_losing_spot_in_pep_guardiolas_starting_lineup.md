John Stones plans to stay at Manchester City this summer and wants force his way back in to Pep Guardiola's starting line-up, according to reports.

The 26-year-old lost his place in the Manchester City and England starting line-ups last season and has not been picked for Gareth Southgate's Three Lions since the 2019 Nations League Finals. 

Stones has been linked with a move to several Premier League sides, including London trio Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham.

But according to the Telegraph, Stones will not be seeking a move away from the Etihad Stadium this summer and hopes to win back the trust of Guardiola.

The Spanish coach has already added to his defensive ranks this term with the £41million signing of Nathan Ake from Bournemouth.

With Stones behind the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Eric Garcia, Fernandinho and Nicolas Otamendi in the centre-back pecking order at Manchester City, that move looked to push Stones one step closer to the Etihad exit door. 

Chelsea were reportedly keen on Stones' services but the Blues have signed Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr this summer as defensive reinforcements.

Stones was also linked with a move to Arsenal and a reunion with former City assistant coach Mikel Arteta, but the Gunners opted to go for Lille defender Gabriel Magalhaes while William Saliba has returned from a loan spell at Saint-Etienne. 

The English defender arrived at City from Everton in 2016 for £50million which made him the second most-expensive Premier League defender at the time. 

The 26-year-old has since made 133 appearances in all competitions for Guardiola's side and has won two Premier League titles, two League Cups and one FA Cup triumph. 

He has also been capped 39 times for England and was part of the Three Lions squads that finished in third-place at the 2018 World Cup and the 2019 Nations League finals.
