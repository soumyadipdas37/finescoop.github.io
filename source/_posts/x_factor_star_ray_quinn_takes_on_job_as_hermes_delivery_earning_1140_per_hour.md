X Factor star Ray Quinn has 'taken up a job as a Hermes delivery driver earning £11.40 per hour' after he 'feared getting bored' during lockdown. 

The singer, 32, who went onto win Dancing On Ice in 2009, is believed to have started the job at the start of lockdown and delivers across the North West.  

The Hollyoaks actor is 'really popular' with fans and was described by a friend as a 'hard-grafting lad' who 'naturally loves being on the move', according to The Sun.

The source told the publication: 'He feared getting bored so applied for a job with Hermes and has been dropping off packages ever since.

'It’s kept him busy and he’s really popular — especially with fans who want a selfie.' 

MailOnline has contacted Ray's representatives for comment.

In January, Ray, who released his third album Undeniable last month, announced on Instagram that he had proposed to his girlfriend Emily Fletcher over New Year's.

Ray wrote: 'Welcome to the family my Queen #shesaidyes'  

The photo, also shared by teacher Emily, shows the blonde sitting on Ray's knee as she kisses the side of his face while showing off her sparkling diamond.

Captioning her post, Emily wrote: 'The most beautiful things are not seen or heard, but felt .... Falling in love with you is just indescribable.....Forever it is'.

Ray went public with his relationship with Emily in 2017, following his split from ex wife Emma Stephens in 2015, with whom he shares his seven-year-old son Harry.  

He told Star magazine at the time that he met Emily, who also has a young son, on a night out and sweetly insisted that meeting her was 'fate':

'She's a school teacher and we made it official last June. It was fate,' he gushed. 'I believe whatever's meant for you won't pass you by. I can't stand dating apps. A text message or a picture on Tinder is absolutely pointless.'   

Ray, who shot to fame on the third series of X Factor in 2006, split from West End actress Emma Stephens after three years of marriage.

At the time, he said: 'Emma and I have regrettably parted ways. Our lives, after a period of time, have gone down separate paths.

'Despite this obviously being a very difficult period in my life, I am keeping busy with my new music and will be continuing with my UK tour and the release of my new single as planned.'
