Premier Gladys Berejiklian is busy taking care of New South Wales' COVID situation.

But on Thursday the state leader, 49, stopped by the Kyle And Jackie O show where she made a very surprising revelation that left Married At First Sight's Martha Kalifatidis 'embarrassed.'

Host Kyle Sandilands, 49, welcomed Gladys, who joined the show over the phone, and introduced her to Jackie O's fill-in host, Martha, 31.

The radio shock jock asked the Premier: 'Did you ever watch MAFS?'

 After she and the reality star said hello, Gladys said: 'I did watch MAFS.'

Newsreader Brooklyn Ross chimed in: 'She loves reality TV, Gladys!'

But the Premiere's revelation proved to be a sore point for the Greek-beauty, who said: 'How embarrassing for me!' 

Kyle attempted to push the envelop with the Premier and asked if she had seen Martha's racy nude bathtub photo on Instagram.

'Kyle you're talking to the Premier, can you please stay on topic,' Gladys said with a laugh.

The photo the shock jock was referring to was of Martha naked in a bathtub with 'water flown in from Tasmania', shared on Instagram last month.

In the image, Martha covered her bare chest with one hand and crossed one leg over the other, tactfully concealing her modesty. 

Fans of the former makeup artist flocked to the comments section, describing the shot as 'iconic' and ready to 'break the Internet'.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia in June, Martha said 'never in her wildest dreams' did she believe that creating sponsored posts at home would become her full-time job, and expressed her surprise at how financially viable it is.

Although Martha did not reveal the exact figure she charges for branded content, it's estimated she makes anything up to $3,000 for a single sponsored selfie.
