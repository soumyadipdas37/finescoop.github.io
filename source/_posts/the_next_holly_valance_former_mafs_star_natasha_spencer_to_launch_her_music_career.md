Natasha Spencer found fame after she appeared on this year's season of Married At First Sight earlier this year.

And on Saturday, the 26-year-old financial analyst-turned-reality star revealed she is trying to launch a career as a singer.

Speaking on the Reality TV & Me podcast, Natasha revealed: 'I'm actually going into the studio on Thursday.'

'I'm going to do a cover with a pretty massive Australian singer,' she added.

When quizzed about who she is planning to collaborate with, Natasha played coy and revealed: 'He's pretty big. We're talking, I think 33 million plays on SoundCloud.'

'Sydney connections,' she then laughed off.

Natasha revealed the unlikely collaboration came about after someone heard her  singing while she was cleaning.

'I was singing while cleaning, and someone heard me and said, ''Oh my God you can sing'', and then called the person and now we're booked in on Thursday evening.''

'But why not just spread my seeds everywhere? Continue my five minutes of fame onto six,' she jokingly admitted.

The shock career move comes as Martha Kalifatidis, who appeared on MAFS just one year prior revealed surprised fans as she filled in as radio star Jackie 'O' Henderson's spot on The Kyle and Jackie O' show on Thursday.

One listener said the reality TV star 'was as good or if not better than when Jackie is there.' 

'Whilst I am not a huge fan of Martha. The show ran smoothly today and was as good or if not better than when Jackie is there,' another follower tweeted.
