 Zac Efron has confirmed his relationship with Byron Bay local Vanessa Valladares. 

Following months of romance speculation, the couple were spotted holding hands for the first time on Friday as they visited The Farm, a trendy restaurant hub in Byron Bay.   

Zac and Vanessa looked like any other local couple as they picked up a healthy-looking takeaway meal and matching cans of coconut water.  

It's official! Zac Efron, 32, proudly held hands with his new girlfriend Vanessa Valladares, 25, as they stepped out for a romantic lunch date at The Farm in Byron Bay, New South Wales, on Friday 

Clearly in good spirits, the smitten pair were seen merrily chatting and exchanging a few laughs as they made their way through The Farm's sun-drenched grounds. 

Zac dressed for comfort in a cream T-shirt by local Byron Bay label Afends, matched with tan-coloured shorts, black crew socks and white sneakers. 

The High School Musical star shielded his famous face with black sunglasses and a black baseball cap by Australian fashion brand Rip Curl.

Meanwhile, aspiring model Vanessa showcased her long, lean legs in a an orange-and-pink mini skirt, while swathing her slender torso beneath a blue button-up shirt. 

Shunning makeup for the low-key date, the curly-haired stunner completed her look with brown sandals, a gold necklace and a pair of aviator sunglasses. 

She was seen carrying her mobile phone and a set of car keys, suggesting that the couple had driven themselves to the eatery rather than being chaperoned by Zac's entourage.

The Hollywood star reportedly met Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress in Byron Bay.

She's rumoured to have quit her job and is said to be staying with Zac at Belongil Beach.  

Just last week, the pair returned from a skiing holiday in Thredbo, with photos showing the couple touching down at Ballina airport together.

While Vanessa's dating history is not yet known, Zac has had his fair share of famous exes.

In 2005 he began dating actress Vanessa Hudgens after meeting her on the set of High School Musical.

The pair broke up in December 2010.

Zac began dating model and entrepreneur Sami Miró in September 2014, but the pair called it quits in April 2016.   

The Disaster Artist actor has previously spoken about his struggles when it comes to finding love.  

Speaking to the UK Times in 2016, Zac said: 'Dating is something I’ll never be able to do. As in the dictionary definition of dating, because one way or another, I’ve impacted that person’s life and they’ll soon realise it'

'A date has to be very long to dispel whatever people think about me,' he added.  

It comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles last month. 

'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source revealed. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.'

Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.

But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted, hence why he cancelled his trip home.

Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket.

Meanwhile, Zac is rumoured to have recently 'inspected and put in an offer' on a home in Byron Bay, according to The Daily Telegraph.

'He didn't really want to go back to America': It comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles last month 

However, he was apparently outbid at the last minute by a rival buyer.

Zac was apparently disappointed because he had 'fallen in love' with Byron Bay.

While he is staying in Australia for the time being, the Baywatch star will have to return to America eventually due to his filming commitments.

He is scheduled to star in the Disney+ remake of Three Men and a Baby, based on the classic 1987 comedy starring Steve Guttenberg, Tom Selleck and Ted Danson. 

No wonder he's smitten! Vanessa (pictured) isn't afraid to how off her sensational physique in racy bikinis on Instagram
