Leonardo DiCaprio reveals in a new documentary series that he believes none of us will be 'equal' until we all vote.

The 45-year-old actor narrates the upcoming Whose Vote Counts, a joint production between Netflix and Vox Media, along with Selena Gomez and John Legend.

DiCaprio reveals in a sneak peek from the show (via People), where he explains why all Americans should vote, and how important it is this year.

'In 1776, voting was a privilege, almost exclusively for white men with property,' Dicaprio says in the clip.

'In the founding constitution, you will not find the right to vote. This right to vote has been a battlefield in American democracy,' adds a black female voter.

'If your vote didn't matter, why the hell are so many systems and people trying so hard to prevent you from voting?" a Black male voter says, before it comes back to DiCaprio.

'All of us may have been created equal. But we'll never actually be equal until we all vote. So don't wait,' DiCaprio says, as the sneak peek comes to an end.

DiCaprio also produces the docu-series in a partnership between his Appian Way Productions company, with Netflix and Vox Media. 

The series will include a number of voting resources from several organizations including Michelle Obama's nonpartisan group When We All Vote.

Netflix released the trailer for Whose Vote Counts, Explained last week, which also featured Stacey Abrams, Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Whose Vote Counts, Explained will be available to Netflix subscribers worldwide on Monday, September 28.
