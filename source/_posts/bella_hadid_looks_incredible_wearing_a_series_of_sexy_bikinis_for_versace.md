Bella Hadid made sure all eyes were on her when she posed wearing a series of bikinis for a new Versace campaign in Italy on Wednesday. 

The 23-year-old knelt up in the sand wearing a skimpy black triangle number wearing a series of chunky gold jewellery.

She wore her raven hair in a slicked back up-do, before slipping into a plunging patterned crop top which she wore with a black mini skirt. 

Life's a beach: Bella Hadid looked incredible wearing a series of sexy bikinis as she posed up a storm for a Versace campaign in Italy

The Versace Dylan Blue ad, shoot was shot back in June on the beach and Bella looked incredible in all the looks she wore by the brand. 

Also present on the day was Hailey Bieber who looked incredible in a pink triangle bikini. 

Bella is the face for the Versace Dylan Blue fragrance, while Hailey is fronting the second parfum - the Versace Dylan Turquoise fragrance.

Letting her hair down: Wearing a red top and denim, she gave a pal a big hug

In the Dylan Blue ad, Bella kicked off the video wearing large gold earrings with her brunette tresses slicked back into a bun as she posed in front of large rock.

The camera went up and around the rock as someone is heard saying 'the world turns around and around' as three other models lounging on the rock are seen.

It comes up to the other side and Bella is seen now lounging in the sand wearing a sheer chiffon blue dress with a gaping midsection - revealing her midriff and glimpses of her cleavage. She was also wearing a plunging bathing suit beneath.

Shady lady: She also wore an incredible blue Versace swimsuit as she sat under an umbrella 

Iconic: She wore lots of chunky gold jewellery on the day as she posed with a male model 

She wore new gold jewelry as she had one leg up and her head back toward the sand, with 'I was dancing with you in an infinite loop' heard.

The camera looped all the way around her until she appeared upside down in the frame. 

Bella then appears facing the camera and close up, back in the black cut-out crop top and bikini bottoms; the model was spraying herself with the Versace Dylan Blue Fragrance.

Sexy: Bella wore a plunging blue dress which had a huge split going up the front
