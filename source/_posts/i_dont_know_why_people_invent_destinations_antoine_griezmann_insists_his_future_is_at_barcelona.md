Antoine Greizmann has dismissed speculation about his future and insisted that he is settled at Barcelona.

Following the news that Lionel Messi will remain at the Nou Camp, there had been suggestions that Premier League clubs including Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal had been put on alert about the possibility of signing Griezmann.

However, the France international is adamant that he is staying at Barcelona. 

Antoine Griezmann dismissed speculation about his future and says he's staying at Barcelona

Griezmann told M6: 'Is my future at Barça? Yes, I don't know why people invent destinations to see if one day they will be right.

'There I am very good, I know I have the confidence of the club and the coach, so I am fine. It has been a very complicated season for all of us but we aim to restart again.' 

Griezmann's first season as a Barcelona player certainly didn't go to plan as he struggled

The Frenchman insisted that he has the backing of Barcelona's new manager Ronald Koeman

Griezmann joined Barcelona in 2019 from Atletico Madrid for £108million but his first season at the Nou Camp certainly didn't go to plan.

Barcelona ended the campaign without a trophy and Griezmann wasn't at his best as he scored 15 goals in 48 appearances.

The 29-year-old will hope to fare rather better next season as Barcelona enter a new era under Ronald Koeman.  

Koeman's side will get their LaLiga campaign underway on September 26 when they host Villarreal.
