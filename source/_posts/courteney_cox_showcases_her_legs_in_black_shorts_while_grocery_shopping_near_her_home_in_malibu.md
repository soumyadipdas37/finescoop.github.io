The cast of her upcoming Scream 5 has continued to grow, and may even include Selena Gomez.

But Courteney Cox enjoyed some down time on Thursday as she was spotted shopping for grocery at her local Whole Foods in Malibu. 

The actress, 56, cut a casual look in all black and flaunted her legs in the ensemble's shorts.

The Friends actress wore mid-thigh black shorts, with a plain black tee and white sneakers. 

She teamed the sporty outfit with a reusable black face mask and metal rimmed retro looking glasses. 

Courteney slicked her dark locks back into a messy bun as she headed into the store with her phone and wallet in hand.

Courtney is set to reprise her role as Gale Weathers in the upcoming Scream 5, over 20 years after the role in 1996 helped launch her career. 

She will return alongside her ex David Arquette, who will reprise his role as sheriff Dewey Riley, Neve Campbell who will return as Sidney Prescott, Jack Quaid, Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega. 

Fans threw another name into the mix last month when they noticed Cox, Arquette, Barrera and Ortega all began to follow actress/singer Selena Gomez on Instagram.

Intensifying rumors, the Friends alum told Gomez 'Can't wait to meet you' in a comment under a mid-August social media post.

Last week the movie's release date was pushed back from next year until January 2022.

Cox last participated in a Scream film back in 2011, for Scream 4. 

But horror buffs got just a taste of a teaser last Friday when the series' official Twitter account shared a fleeting 10-second clip of the legendary Ghost Face mask.

'On January 14, 2022… We’re going to hear you SCREAM,' they tweeted along with an ominous closeup of the mask.

The Scream saga started in 1996 with a bloody, self-referential teen horror romp directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. 

The original stared the likes of Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, and Drew Barrymore. 

Scream was a sure hit, grossing $173million globally after being produced for a reported $15m. Sequels came in 1997, 2000 and 2011.

Filming on number five was initially expected to take place later this year in Wilmington, North Carolina. 

Ready Or Not's Matthew Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett are directing the reboot from a script penned by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick.
