She may be a self-made near-billionaire but Kylie Jenner still has a soft spot for her regular neighborhood spots.

The 23-year-old make-up mogul was seen leaving a lunch at Calabasas favorite Sagebrush Cantina on Wednesday.

She flaunted curvaceous figure in a clinging sleeveless black bodysuit contrasted by flowy matching trousers as she left the local Mexican restaurant.

Though she dined in at the restaurant, she made sure to take all other precautions as she sported a plain black face mask as she hopped into her black Rolls Royce

No doubt Kylie is every bit the fashionista as on Tuesday she took to her Instagram to share photos of herself rocking a designer ensemble with her 195million followers.

She had the waist taken in, some buttons down the front removed in order to expose more of her chest, and she shortened the length of the dress.

The Kylie Cosmetics founder had a chainlink pouch purse, a highly sought after Bottega Veneta accessory, tucked under her arm as she posed for photos at her Hidden Hills home.

To coordinate with the bag's eye-catching strap, Jenner wore a pair of gold chainlink earrings.

She slipped her feet into a pair of white heels, also by Bottega Veneta, that featured a triangular heel and espadrille-inspired ankle straps. 

Kylie had her hair parted down one side and she let her lengthy brunette strands flow down her back.

She opted for a more subdued version of her go-to makeup look, which included a neutral pink pout, some soft winged eyeliner, and a generous amount of pink blush.

 The KUWTK star shared a total of six stunning snapshots with her 195million followers, which allowed them to get a 360 degree view of her outfit.
