A scarf is a must-have autumn accessory. Not only is it ideal for layering during confusing in-between weather, but it can add a pop of colour to any outfit and instantly elevate your look. 

The Mulberry Tree Print Scarf is a surprisingly chic, affordable and popular discovery on Amazon. At just £4.40, the scarf is a bargain buy and shoppers are snapping it up in a range of colours. 

Light but large in size, it's perfect for keeping in your bag should the weather change. Plus, with 13 colours available, you can find one for any occasion. 

The Mulberry Tree Print Scarf has become a popular buy with Amazon shoppers who have been impressed by the quality and style - all for under £5

'Beautiful scarf, & so much material' said one shopper in their review. 'Looks lovely on, looks great with jeans as lovely denim colour, looks quite expensive.'
