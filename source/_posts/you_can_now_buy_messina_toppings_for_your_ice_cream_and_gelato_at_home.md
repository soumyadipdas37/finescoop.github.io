Australia's beloved Gelato Messina has released a new range of take-home toppings for customers to add onto their favourite ice cream or gelato

The selection features three different flavours, including choc hazelnut, caramel and peanut butter

The chocolate hazelnut flavour is made from a rich blend of roasted Piedmont hazelnuts and cocoa, while the dulce de leche, which is Spanish for caramel, is made using a traditional South American milk jam.

The peanut butter flavour is ideal for peanut addicts, but is currently sold out.

The toppings are available across all Gelato Messina store locations.

Not only can the toppings be added to ice cream, but they can also be used to make delicious milkshakes - which will be sure to please on warm days

In the Sydney suburb of Rosebury, the tasty gelato toppings are made from scratch using the finest ingredients.

Not only can the toppings be added to ice cream, but they can also be used to make delicious milkshakes - which will be sure to please customers on warm days.

Messina recommends making the milkshakes by blending 30mL of the topping with 250mL of milk until perfectly smooth and combined.

As the toppings are made from rich ingredients, they might be quite thick but Messina recommends microwaving the blend for 40 seconds to soften it

'We need to try it!' one woman said, another added: 'Way too dangerous.'
