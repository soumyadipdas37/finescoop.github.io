David Warner is currently playing cricket for the Indian Premier League in the United Arab Emirates. 

And between games he took some time out to reflect on his marriage with his wife Candice Warner, 35. 

Posting to Instagram, the 33-year-old shared a throwback snap from their wedding and explained 'how lucky' he was to have her.   

'I truly am grateful!' On Tuesday, cricketer David Warner delivered a gushing tribute to his wife Candice (both pictured) as he reflected on the 'ups and downs' of their marriage 

'When time flies, you sometimes forget to reflect on how lucky we are, especially when you look back at memories,' he wrote. 

The sportsman explained that 'six years and three children later' he still loves to reminisce about all the reasons why he married his 'soul mate and best friend'.  

And while he admitted that the couple have experienced their fair share of 'laughter, tears, ups and downs', he is always 'grateful' to have Candice by his side.

'Words will never be enough to describe what @candywarner1 means to me. I truly am grateful I have such a strong, determined, loving, caring wife.'  

It comes after he bid his three daughters a sweet farewell last month before departing to play cricket for the United Arab Emirates. 

Posting to Instagram, David shared a sweet series of photos of his 'gorgeous girls' as they soaked up the sun in Sydney.

'My gorgeous girls enjoying a great day out,' he wrote underneath a series of photos.

'Extremely blessed to have such a supportive, understanding, caring and loving wife,' he continued.
