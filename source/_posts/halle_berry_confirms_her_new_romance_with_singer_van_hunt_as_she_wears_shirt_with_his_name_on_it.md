The Monster's Ball star, 54, wore a shirt with the 50-year-old musical artist's name on it, captioning the post, 'now ya know...' with a heart emoji after recent speculation she's in a new relationship.

The latest: Halle Berry, 54, made a fashion statement in confirming her romance singer Van Hunt on Instagram Thursday as she wore a shirt with the 50-year-old musical artist's name on it, captioning the post, 'now ya know...'

The A-list actress last month hinted she was seeing someone, writing, 'sunday,funday' alongside a shot of her feet mingled with a mystery man's.

The Cleveland native again shared a shot of their feet last month as she showed her gratitude for birthday greetings after she turned 54 on August 14.

The Bruised star and director wrote at the time: 'Waking up Vegas! Thank you for all the beautiful birthday wishes from my friends and my very supportive and loyal fans! You ALL helped to make my birthday extra special.'

Like Berry, Hunt has garnered critical acclaim in his field, winning a Grammy in 2007 for best R&B performance by a duo or group for his work on a cover of the Sly & the Family Stone song Family Affair.

Hint: Hunt shared a shot with the Oscar-winner on Instagram last month

She added heart filters to the post as she announced the new romance with the musician 

The star is a mother-of-two, to daughter Nahla, 12, with ex Gabriel Aubry, and son Maceo, six, with ex-husband Olivier Martinez.

The Catwoman star this past April appeared on an Instagram Live stream with her friend Lena Waithe, talking about her love life and parenting amid the early days of the COVID-19 shutdown.

'I've learned a lot being with my children,' she said. 'They are the best company for me right now, and when I divorced Maceo's dad I've been pretty alone by myself going on three years now. Decidedly so, for sure.

'I have decided to take time. I'm very much a relationship-oriented person, I always want to be with someone. But I decided, no I'm going to slow my roll, I'm going to take a minute and I'm going to spent time with me. And it's been so great that I think I might stay like this!'
