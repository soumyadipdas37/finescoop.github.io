She's the rogue Bachelor star who has been spilling secrets about the show since making her exit on the first episode.

And now Nadine Kodsi is back at it again, this time claiming to know who the final two women in Locky Gilbert's season are. 

In a lengthy Instagram post, the 30-year-old said that Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska will make it to the end of the show.

The criminologist admitted that she wasn't completely sure which of the two will win, despite previously stating on the So Dramatic podcast that Bella was the winner.

'I was told by several people that Bella wins,' she wrote.

'Remember I was only in the house for a short period of time, all my information has come from girls who were in there longer and from group chats.

'I did however state that it is between Irena and Bella. They are def top two. However, who actually wins 100% I can not possibly predict that as I am not god,' she continued.

'From what I have been told it’s Bella. So please if you’re going to place bets, gamble responsible as I don’t want to be the blame for anyone losing money.'

Nadine added: 'And as I have said to all people who are betting, I would bet on both evenly to be safe.'

'I was told by several people that Bella wins': Nadine believes that Bella will be the last woman standing 

It's been widely reported in the media that Bella and Irena are the final two, with Sportsbet betting odds also reflecting this.

Nurse Irena is currently the favourite to win, with 1.50 to Bella's 3.50 on Sportsbet.

As previous seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette have shown, betting odds are rarely wrong when it comes to predicting the winner.

As the odds continue to swing in Irena's favour with each passing episode, it is looking more likely that Bella will be the heartbroken runner-up.

Interestingly, before The Bachelor premiere on August 12, she and Irena had been TAB's joint favourites to win, with odds of $2.50 each.

It wasn't until after the first episodes went to air that Irena emerged as the clear favourite and Bella's odds started to lengthen.
