Footy WAG Rebecca Judd has been happily married to retired AFL star Chris Judd for the past decade.

But the 37-year-old took a trip down memory lane on Tuesday as she reminisced about the 'type' of guy she used to date before she met the footballer.

Rebecca said on the 3pm Pick-Up that she actually had a thing for British DJs while in her late teens.

Say what?! Rebecca Judd took a trip down memory lane on Tuesday as she reminisced about the 'type' of guy she used to date before she met  AFL champion Chris Judd 

'I was really, really into DJs. If they were a drum and bass DJ, then extra points. If they were from the UK, extra points,' Bec told her co-host Katie 'Monty' Dimond.

'And if they were Reebok classic sneakers, loved them!'

Rebecca revealed she had a wild streak in her youth, and would 'sneak into clubs' when she was 16 and 17 to check out who was on the decks.

'If they were from the UK, extra points!' Rebecca said on the 3pm Pick-Up that she actually had a thing for British DJs while in her late teens. Pictured as a teenager

'I used to sneak into this club when I was 16 or 17, and it was called the Drum Club with my fake ID and my braces. Acne,' she recalled. 

Despite her adolescent forays into dance music culture, Rebecca said she was glad she ended up with an Aussie sportsman. 

Monty pointed out that while DJs may seem appealing to younger women, their lifestyles are actually 'revolting'. 

All's well that ends well: Despite her adolescent forays into dance music culture, Rebecca said she was glad she ended up with an Aussie sportsman 

'Ugh. Foul. Foul,' Rebecca replied. '"I'm just going to do my shift. My 1am till 4am shift." Gross!' 

She concluded by saying that one particular crush of hers, DJ Frantik, scored extra points because his family owned the local fish and chip shop.

'I really liked him back in the day,' she said. 

He's the one: The Postcards host married Chris, a former captain of two AFL teams, in 2010

'He did shifts [at the fish and chip shop] during the week - so he had multiple careers,' she added.

'But he already had a girlfriend who was manager of the local Macca's. She was the manager, so she had extra street cred.'

'I wish you ended up with DJ Frantic so bad,' Monty laughed. 

Happily ever after! The couple share four children: son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and three-year-old twin boys Tom and Darcy

'I would have inherited the fish and chip shop! Love it,' Rebecca replied. 

The Postcards host married Chris, a former captain of two AFL teams, in 2010. 

The couple share four children: son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and three-year-old twin boys Tom and Darcy.

Still going strong: Rebecca and Chris have been married for 10 years
