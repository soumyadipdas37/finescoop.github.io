The first trailer has dropped for Bad President, a satire film chronicling Donald Trump's rise to power in 2016 which features porn star Stormy Daniels herself. 

The movie directed by Param Gill is set to be released October 12 on video-on-demand, with Jeff Rector taking on the lead role of Trump opposite Eddie Griffin as Satan. 

In the trailer, which came out hours before the first 2020 presidential debate on Tuesday, Rector's Trump is seen launching his 2016 campaign by making a deal with Griffin's Devil, who coaches him on how to 'take your powers of BS to a whole new level'.   

The film, inspired by real headlines, hits on some of the most memorable real moments of the unprecedented campaign, including Trump's targeted attacks on 'rapist' Mexicans and 'dangerous' Muslims, bragging about his sexual exploits and of course, the hush money scheme with Daniels.

The trailer opens with the Devil asking his minions who they should recruit to wreak havoc on Earth. 

'We work with Charles Manson, Richard Nixon, Hitler...when was the last time you ran into a genuine dark triad? Minions, do we have anybody that'll fit that bill?' the Devil asks. 

One minion raises his hand and says: 'I've got one,' as the screen cuts to Griffin as Trump - complete with a jarring fake tan and yellow quaff - strutting through a mansion.  

'He's a narcissist, he's Machiavellian, a psychopath,' the minion says before another exclaims: 'A dark triad!' 

Trump is then seen looking in a mirror and telling himself: 'If a guy from Kenya not even born in the US can become president, you can too.' 

That statement was in reference to the real Trump's repeated promotion of the birther conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. 

The next scene shows the Devil arriving at Trump's mansion to meet with him. 

'I can make you president. I guarantee you,' the Devil tells Trump.

'Besides running my global empire, besides being the biggest celebrity on TB, besides being the most handsome man in the world, a billionaire, and banging some of the hottest women in the world, I'm going to run for president,' Trump says 

Throughout the trailer the Devil is seen praising Trump for his unlikely rise to the top of the Republican presidential ticket 

'Besides running my global empire, besides being the biggest celebrity on TB, besides being the most handsome man in the world, a billionaire, and banging some of the hottest women in the world, I'm going to run for president,' Trump says into a speakerphone, prompting the person on the other end of the line to cackle uncontrollably.  

The Devil is then seen asking his minions: 'What psycho would vote for this son of a b—,' before a news clip shows an anchor saying: 'Donald Trump now leads the Republican field of presidential candidates.' 

The following shots show Trump promoting his campaign with the Devil by his side - before Daniels shows up at his door. 

Trump calls his personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen and tells him: 'We have a problem.'

In real life, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claimed that she had sex with Trump in 2006 while he was married to first lady Melania (a claim the White House denies). 

Cohen admitted to paying Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep her from telling her story publicly in 2016. Cohen said he arranged the payment at Trump's direction. 

The trailer ends with the Devil handing Trump his campaign slogan. 

'I'm counting on you to Make America Great Again,' the Devil says to Trump lounging in a bathtub.

VMI Worldwide picked up the global rights to Bad President back in June and shopped the movie at the Cannes virtual Marche. 

The film is scripted by Gill, the director, and John Buchanan, who are best known for their work on the 2014 comedy Going to America, which also starred Griffin.   

'Bad President is a film we all need to see especially before the 2020 election to remind us of the incidents that took place five years ago,' Gill said over the summer.

'I enjoyed taking Trump's true statements and unforgettable moments and turning them into something we could all laugh at.' 

VMI founder Andre Relis added: 'The world is laughing at Trump not with him – this film really nails it. 

'I am proud to be working with the very talented director and writer, Param Gill and happy to have the opportunity for VMI to premiere this film in Virtual Cannes.'
