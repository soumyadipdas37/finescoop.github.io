The nasty infection picked up by Cristiano Ronaldo has been likened to that of a bee sting by Portugal boss Fernando Santos.  

Santos was downbeat when asked about the health of his best player ahead of a Nations League double-header against Croatia and Sweden. 

Ronaldo picked up an infection on his right toe and is set to miss both games with Santos unconvinced that he will be '100 per cent OK' to play. 

 Cristiano Ronaldo's involvement in upcoming Nations League games remains in real doubt

Speaking to reporters, Santos said: 'I am very doubtful that he will be 100 per cent OK.

'He had been training well, then suddenly on Wednesday one of his toes was red, as if he'd been stung by a bee.

'Now we have to wait. With an infection, you don't know how long the recovery is going to take.'

Missing both games would cause great frustration for Ronaldo as he continues to stay patient in a bid to reach 100 international goals. 

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Ronaldo has been stuck on 99 goals for 10 months and this international break on the eve of the new season provided him the first opportunity to tally up a century of strikes for Portugal. 

His 99th goal came against Luxembourg in a 2-0 Euro 2020 qualifying win on November 17.  

Portugal won the Nations League last year with Ronaldo playing a starring role, hitting a hat-trick in the semi-final,  and so his absence to start their Nations League defence is a major disappointment for Santos.
