An Australian swimwear label endorsed by celebrities like Hailey Bieber sell more than 150 'one size fits all' swim pieces made from a special 'super stretchy fabric'.

Bond-Eye Swim has earned a reputation in the fashion industry for being at the forefront of bikini trends, curating ribbed material, cut out designs and popping colours in every capsule collection.

And while it does sell swimsuit options tailored from size small to large, allowing customers to mix and match tops and bottoms in varied sizes, it also offers a 'one size' option.

'We know what you're thinking - one size fits most? Really? But I'm not like most girls,' the fit guide on its website read.

'Our unique fit is achieved through the super stretchy fabric that moulds to your body shape and our carefully designed garment construction. 

'All our BOUND by Bond-Eye pieces are made to fit from an XXS to M (i.e. 6 – 12)'.

Within the BOUND range there are countless colours to choose from - including tie dye - and various levels of coverage.

'I just bought the Sasha suit for the second time! I can't wait to wear it. I've finally found a top that can fit my large chest perfectly,' one woman said.

'I love how your swimwear fits and suits all of us the same way... and it feels so comfortable too,' said another.

Social media images show women with various hair colours, skin tones and body shapes wearing the brand with ease

A third added: 'Finally swimwear that loves my body just the way I am'.
