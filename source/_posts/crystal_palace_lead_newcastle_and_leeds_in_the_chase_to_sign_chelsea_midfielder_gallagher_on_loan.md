Crystal Palace are leading the chase to sign Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher on loan.

The 20-year old is close to agreeing a new long term contract with Chelsea before going out on a temporary move for the season.

A number of Premier League sides, including Leeds and Newcastle, have expressed interest in the energetic England U21 international who impressed on loan at Swansea City last season.

Palace though have been eager to convince Gallagher to join them and have instigated talks with Chelsea and the player's representatives.

The 20-year-old came on as a second-half substitute for injured summer signing Hakim Ziyech in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Brighton in a friendly on Saturday.

Gallagher's current deal at Stamford Bridge runs until 2022 but any fears over his long-term future at the club appear to be over.

The midfielder moved to Wales in January after spending the first half of the season at Charlton.Â 

Gallagher played 19 times to help Steve Cooper's Swansea, who finished 6th and set up a play-off semi against Brentford.

But despite winning the first leg 1-0, Swansea collapsed at Griffin Park to lose 3-2 on aggregate.
