This is the shocking moment a motorcyclist pulling a wheelie lets off fireworks from his bike into the air while speeding down the busy A40 in West London.

The footage, thought to be taken in Perivale last week, shows a biker repeatedly firing the explosives from the front of their motorcycle frame.

A fellow rider caught the dangerous stunt on their helmet camera and could be heard shouting in the background.

The motorcyclist can be seen performing wheelies and shooting fireworks in the footage, thought to be taken on the A40 in Perivale last week 

The video was posted onto social media, with one Twitter use commenting: 'Must be what I heard last night?

'Thought it was a gun going off, couldn't see anything from my place but I could certainly hear engines being "driven" very fast/loud.' 

Towards the start of the clip, the motorcyclist can be seen overtaking drivers and three other bikers before lighting the fireworks.

The rider starts performing wheelies while aiming the explosives into the air, before they ping onto the road in front. 

Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident, tweeting that 'local officers have been informed'.

Similar footage previously showed a road rage cyclist shooting fireworks from a homemade device strapped to his pedal bike in Italy.

The angry cyclist took aim at motorbikers and almost hit them several times as he fired the explosives from the front of his bike frame.

With one hand on the handlebar, he used the other to pull a lighter from his pocket and he started lighting the fireworks. 

He shot fireworks at the man, who ducked and dived to avoid getting hit, until he ran out of ammunition. 

MailOnline has contacted the Met Police for comment.
