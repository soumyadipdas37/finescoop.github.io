A man who pocketed more than $1million after winning the Lotto twice has revealed how the jackpot changed his life. 

Michael, from Perth's northern suburbs, first won in June 2013 when he took home am OzLotto division two prize of $81,000.

'I thought, ''s*** there must have been a mistake'',' he told Perth Now. 

'You're just so happy. My mindset is ''you'll only do it [win big] once''.'

But Michael's luck didn't end there, with the Lotto player going on to win more than $1million in another draw.

Michael, who is self-employed, had already managed to pay off his mortgage after his first Lotto prize.

After his second win, Michael decided to buy a luxury sports car that he had always 'dreamed' of owning.

Describing himself as a 'simple guy', Michael explained he didn't want to blow his fortune on a big mansion where he'd spend all his time cleaning. 

He would rather cruise the streets of Perth and take his luxury car on a road trip to Geraldton, Albany or to the coast. 

Michael now works part-time but spends his free time looking after himself and doing what he loves.

In his spare time, Michael likes to go cray fishing and is able to sleep in (stock image)

He doesn't even need to set an alarm for his mornings, instead relying on outside noise to wake him up. 

'I can sleep in, go cray fishing. Life's not bad,' he said.

Despite his two wins, Michael continues to test his luck playing Lotto. 

Lotto players are vying for their shot at $40million this week with two $20million draws. 

There is the $20million Powerball on Thursday and another $20million up for grabs in Saturday's Lotto.
