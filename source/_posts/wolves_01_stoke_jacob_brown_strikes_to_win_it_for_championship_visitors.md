Wolves' record signing Fabio Silva missed a glorious chance for a debut goal as Stoke substitute Jacob Brown condemned Nuno Espirito Santo's men to two cup exits in as many months.

After their marathon 2019-20 campaign ended with defeat by Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final on August 11, Wolves crashed out of this term's Carabao Cup at the first attempt thanks to Brown's strike three minutes from full-time.

It could have been so different if Silva – a £35m buy from Porto – has kept his nerve moments earlier, but the 18-year-old volleyed wide in the 75th minute when it appeared easier to score. Stoke's victory set up a home tie with Gillingham in round four and left Wolves to reflect that one opportunity to win a trophy this term has gone as quickly as it came.

Nuno made six changes to the side that started the 2-0 win at Sheffield United on Monday, with Vitinha – another transfer window arrival from Porto along with Silva – making his full debut. 

Stoke made seven changes to the team that began their Championship campaign with a goalless draw at Millwall last Saturday.

The Stoke defenders gave Silva the traditional welcome to English football as the youngster was clattered in the 25th minute by Nathan Collins.

Before that, Silva had fired over from the edge of the box after controlling Oskar Buur's long pass on his chest, and soon afterwards he might have done better from close range after Adama Traore's cross had caused havoc in the Stoke box.

Wolves' best chance of a drab opening half fell to Leander Dendoncker, who drifted into space in the box and connected with Ruben Neves' chip with a header that fell narrowly wide. 

In first-half stoppage time, Traore – Wolves' liveliest player – saw a powerful shot well blocked by Harry Souttar.

With five across the back, Stoke had come to contain Wolves – yet they created two excellent chances in the first 20 minutes of the second half.

First Souttar rose at the far post and headed straight at John Ruddy from six yards, and then Steven Fletcher – less than a minute after replacing Sam Vokes – was denied by Conor Coady's fine block.

Once again behind closed doors, Wolves struggled to conjure up the energy needed to win

When Wolves had a rare chance to counter-attack, Silva found Pedro Neto and the substitute burst towards the Stoke box before playing a return pass. Silva cut inside only to see his strike deflected wide.

Then Silva wasted that wonderful opportunity for a debut goal. Neto's free-kick from deep picked out Willy Boly at the far post. The defender's header across goal was perfect for Silva, yet the teenager fluffed the chance, somehow steering his volley wide from an unmarked position inside the six-yard box.

With full-time approaching, Wolves were made to pay when James McClean powered in off the left and found Fletcher, who teed up Brown. The shot should really have been saved by Ruddy but he could only palm it into the net.

There was still time for Silva to shoot high and wide in stoppage time as Stoke held on.
