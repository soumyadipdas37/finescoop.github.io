Selma Blair has been enjoying plenty of quality family time at home with son Arthur Saint during quarantine.

But the Grammy nominee has also been able to steal away for some adult time with boyfriend Ron Carlson.

She packed on the PDA Saturday with her movie producer boyfriend, as they enjoyed a romantic stroll along the beach in Malibu.

The 48-year-old wrapped her legs around Carlson, 51, as he picked her up and walked toward the water.

She kept cozy in a black fleece pullover with light grey sweatpants, a black and white checkered scar and a matching striped face mask.

Carlson donned a tan sweater with palm tree-printed pajama pants, a blue camouflage face mask and a white bucket hat.
