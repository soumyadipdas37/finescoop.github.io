Wolves are close to completing the £35million signing of Barcelona right-back Nelson Semedo, according to reports.

Nuno Espirito Santo has been searching for a replacement for Matt Doherty following his departure to Tottenham and sees Semedo as the ideal candidate, according to Fabrizio Romano for the Guardian.

The Portugal international is deemed surplus to requirements at the Catalan club as new manager Ronald Koeman tries to overhaul the squad after a traumatic season and summer.

Wolves are reportedly close to agreeing the £35m transfer of Nelson Semedo from Barcelona

Nuno Espirito appears to have found his replacement for Matt Doherty who left for Tottenham

The report indicates Barca are holding out for £36m but there is confidence from all sides that the deal will be completed.

A further tweet from the sports journalist indicates the 26-year-old will sign a five-year deal with the Midlands club and will undergo a medical next week.

Semedo has made 124 appearances for Barcelona since signing in 2017 but was one of several players criticised in a rare trophyless season at the Nou Camp which culminated in a dismal 8-2 drubbing by Bayern Munich.

Should the deal go through, it will be Wolves' fifth major signing of the summer after bringing in Fabio Silva, Fernando Marcal, Vitor Ferreira and Ki-Jana Hoever. 

Wolves have already confirmed the signing of Ki-Jana Hoever from Liverpool this weekend

Versatile forward Diogo Jota also completed a £41m move to Liverpool on Saturday. 

Koeman appears to have secured another outgoing as Aturo Vidal is reportedly set to sign a two-year contract with Inter Milan for less than £1m, according to the same report.
