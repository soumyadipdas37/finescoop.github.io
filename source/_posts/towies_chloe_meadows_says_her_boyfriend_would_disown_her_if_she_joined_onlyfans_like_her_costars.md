Her relationship with banker boyfriend George Wales has gone from strength to strength in lockdown. 

And Chloe Meadows has revealed that marriage and babies are definitely on the cards for the pair - who are in the process of buying their first home together.  

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline ahead of the Series 26 launch on Sunday, the reality star, 27, went on to quip that one thing could split them up, however, joining X-rated subscription site, OnlyFans.

OnlyFans is an online service that allows public figures to charge fans a subscription to their site, where they often share content usually deemed too provocative for other social media platforms.

Although it is mainly used by amateur porn stars to share exclusive content with their fans, it has gained a slew of celebrity creators in recent months, including Chloe's former co-stars, TOWIE's Lauren Goodger and Celebrity Sex Pod's Chloe Khan. 

Asked if she would consider making an account, Chloe mused: 'My parents and boyfriend would disown me!' I'm gonna say no. 

'Bella Thorne made a million, it's crazy... but I don’t think so. I'm sure half the pictures are innocent, not that wild. But there is still a stigma. Everyone thinks its X-rated. It's not my bag!'

Talk soon turned to Chloe's boyfriend, George, who has managed to stay out of the spotlight despite his girlfriend's fame. 

The couple were childhood sweethearts but split in 2016, with Chloe admitting that was her motivation for joining TOWIE, as she wanted her ex to see her dating other people as 'revenge'. 

During her time on the show, Chloe struck up a romance with Taylor Barnett, who she was introduced to by Courtney Green, as he was the best friend of her ex, Myles Barnett.

However, things were not meant to be, and after a year of dating, Chloe ended up reconciling with city worker George.   

'Not my bag': Chloe quipped her boyfriend would 'disown' her if she joined X-rated subscription site Only Fans like her former co-star Lauren Goodger 

Asked if George would ever join Chloe on TOWIE like Taylor did, the reality star didn't rule out the possibility, but insisted the banker would never be a permanent fixture.  

She laughed: 'TOWIE ask me every week, constantly! He loves it, he's so flattered. 

'He would never come on as a full cast member, he has another job, but maybe as a cameo, so people don’t think I've made him up! Maybe one day.'

The pair have been going from strength to strength behind the camera, however, with the duo growing even closer during lockdown. 

Admitting she 'feels bad' for having had such a lovely experience when so many people struggled, she confessed: 'We had a nice time. I’m needy so I loved it!'

Chloe - who launched her own jewellery brand J Florence during lockdown - continued: 'We learnt to enjoy not going out, getting into series together and reading books. 

'If we ever were to have an argument (pre-corona), it would be about outside things like going out, and none of that was happening!' 

Put a ring on it: Although the pair are focusing on finding a house together first, Chloe confessed that she does expect a proposal soon

Although the pair are focusing on finding a house together first, Chloe confessed that she does expect a proposal soon. 

'A ring would not go amiss!' she laughed. 'We were recently in Santorini and the amount of people who messaged me saying I was going to get engaged! Even Courtney [Green]... and I thought they were going to ruin a surprise.' 

Revealing that she is willing to be patient for a little while longer, she mused: 'He wants to get the house secured. Get the house, then it's a waiting game!' 

Taking a step back: Although the pair see kids in their future, Chloe insisted that we won't be hearing the pitter patter for a while as the pair go travelling and enjoy their freedom

One matter that neither Chloe or George are in a rush for is having children. 

Although the pair see kids in their future, Chloe insisted that we won't be hearing the pitter patter for a while as the pair go travelling and enjoy their freedom.   

Chloe is also being kept busy for now by filming TOWIE, with the latest socially distanced series set to launch on the weekend. 

Explaining how the cast were able to keep the spark of the show alight amid the pandemic, she confessed: 'When we first went back it was really strange. 

'We'd be talking but standing two metres apart and it felt like we were shouting. But the magic of television means it doesn’t look silly, and now it feels normal.' 

Reflecting on her four-year stint on the show in light of the 10 year anniversary special, Chloe admitted she struggles to watch back some of her earlier scenes.     

'It's hard to look back, I was so much younger and didn’t know what I was doing. I struggled with confrontation

'But that's the best thing to come out of TOWIE, I learnt to stick up for myself'.  

TOWIE premieres Sunday at 9pm on ITVBe. Continues every Wednesday and Sunday.
