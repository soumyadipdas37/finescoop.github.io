Parents having their children baptised face an agonising decision over having grandparents present after Christenings were limited to just six people. 

Downing Street confirmed today that the Christian rite of faith will be subject to the Rule of Six. 

The decision has been taken despite weddings being allowed to go ahead with 15 guests from Monday and funerals allowed up to 30 mourners.

The decision will leave parents in a quandary. The baby is included in the total, plus a priest. 

If both parents are present that leaves only two more places to cover godparents and grandparents - or any other friends and family they wish to have present. 

The Church of England website suggests those being baptised should have 'at least three' godparents, although the parents can take up two of those roles, plus one other. 

The rule change comes days after Boris Johnson had his own son baptised.

Boris Johnson and his fiancee Carrie Symonds had their baby son Wilfred christened a Catholic, the largest Catholic cathedral in England and Wales has confirmed 

Westminster Cathedral said the couple had their four-month-old son baptised there in a ceremony on September 12 by Father Daniel Humphreys

The Prime Minister and fiancee Carrie Symonds had Wilfred christened a Catholic, it was confirmed this week.

Westminster Cathedral said the couple had their four-month-old son baptised there in a ceremony on September 12, conducted by Father Daniel Humphreys.

There was a small ceremony held in the cathedral's Lady Chapel, according to The Daily Telegraph.

It is understood the christening was a small ceremony held in the Henry VII Lady Chapel, a 16th-century building which is the burial place of 15 monarchs including Elizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots and James I 

The Prime Minister and Ms Symonds, who has previously talked about her Catholic faith on social media, were reportedly holding Wilfred as he was baptised.
