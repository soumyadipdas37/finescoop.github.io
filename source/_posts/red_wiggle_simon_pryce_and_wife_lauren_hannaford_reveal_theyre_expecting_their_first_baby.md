The Wiggles star Simon Pryce and his wife Lauren Hannaford are expecting their first baby.

The red Wiggle, 48, and fitness trainer Lauren, 33, shared the good news on Instagram on Sunday while celebrating Father's Day. 

Alongside two photos in which the performer cuddles up to his already heavily pregnant wife of three years, they revealed the baby is due next year.

Simon captioned the photos: 'Lauren and I are beyond excited and overjoyed to be expecting our first baby in early 2021.

'I already feel like I'm bursting with love. I think Lauren will be happy when it's born so I stop talking to her stomach, especially when we are in the supermarket aisle.'

He concluded by adding: 'Happy Father's Day to me. Well not quite yet but soon. #BabyPryce #2021'.

In the photos, Lauren showed off her blossoming bump while The Wiggles performer gently and lovingly cradled it. 

It's good news for the pair, who last year announced plans to start trying for a baby.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph late last year, Lauren said the couple have been 'talking about it forever' but their busy schedules have made it impossible.    

'We would love to have a family [but] it's just a matter of being in the same place at the right time for that to happen,' she told the publication. 

He added: 'I think Lauren will be happy when it's born so I stop talking to her stomach, especially when we are in the supermarket aisle. Happy Father's Day to me. Well not quite yet but soon'
