The Victorian government is considering banning indoor dining until community transmissions of COVID-19 reach zero and hold at that level for two weeks.

With just one week to go before the coronavirus-hit state's stay-at-home orders are due to end after more than two months, an announcement on what the road out of lockdown will look like is to be announced on Sunday.

So far Premier Daniel Andrews has given few details, but a new report by the Herald Sun on Sunday has revealed that ban on indoor dining will continue.

The modelling for the plan is based on a similar policy which was introduced in New York after the city was ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic back in April.

One of the state's leading restaurateurs has labelled the move a 'disaster' which will cost the already struggling hospitality industry 150,000 jobs.    

'They are locked into a death spiral that will see a lot of us go broke,' Chris Lucas, the CEO of Melbourne's largest restaurant group Lucas Restaurants, said.

The Restaurant and Catering Industry of Australia predicts about one third of the Victoria's food industry staff could be affected if the restrictions are extended.

Mr Lucas says further shutdowns will mean about 20 to 30 per cent of the state's restaurants and cafe will never re-open. 

In past few weeks government officials have been in talks with the hospitality sector about about the best way to exit lockdown.

But some in the industry have called the negotiations 'futile'.

That means about 150,000 jobs could be lost in the already struggling hospitality industry (pictured, an empty restaurant in Melbourne's Lygon Street)

'The industry consultations have been a platform used by the government to basically dictate to us what their plan is for each industry,' Mr Lucas said.

He claims any genuine concerns they've been dismissed and that a senior government minister told him the state government was committed to it's zero community transmissions policy at all costs.

'The so called plan that they are going around saying that they're getting industry input from is a lie,' Mr Lucas said.

In the past two weeks there have been been 531 community transmissions in Victoria. 

Health experts and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian have warned that COVID-19 infections may never reach zero and remain there for two weeks. 

But Mr Andrews has warned 'thousands' of Victorians would die if strict coronavirus restrictions were to be lifted too swiftly.

Stage Four restrictions in Melbourne, and Stage Three in the rest of the state, are set to end on September 13 at 11.59pm. 

But speaking on Saturday, a day ahead of his announcement on easing restrictions, Mr Andrews said lockdown was unlikely to end. 

Victorians have been cooped up since July 8 only permitted to leave the house for essential reasons like grocery shopping, health appointments, work and exercise. 

'To open up with those numbers would, of course, see the total number of coronavirus infections explode,' Mr Andrews said.

'It would see many, many hundreds, indeed thousands, of Victorians infected with this virus. 

'So, as frustrating, as challenging as it is, we need to stay the course on this. 

'That's why tomorrow we will outline a road map to ease these important restrictions, to ease out of the second wave, once it's appropriately and properly defeated. Truly defeated.' 

Victoria recorded 76 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths on Saturday, with the welcome infection numbers coming after a spike earlier in the week saw 113 new cases after days of double digit transmission.

If COVID-19 infections were to spread out-of-control, Australia's health system could become overwhelmed, according to modelling by the Grattan Institute (pictured, their report)

Friday was Victoria's deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 59 deaths announced - but 50 of those had occurred back in July and August in aged care homes.

Bombshell leaked documents also revealed on Thursday that Melbourne's strict Stage 4 lockdown could be extended by another two weeks. 

A top secret draft for Victoria's recovery appeared to reveal the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew and keep restrictions on businesses for an additional two weeks. 

While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked map is 'out of date', Mr Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Stage 4 restrictions.

'Everything is on the table,' he admitted. 'It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.' 

According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage 4 comes to an end.

The final decision will be announced on Sunday.
