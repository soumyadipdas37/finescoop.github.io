Kyle Sandilands recounted the humiliating moment he referred to actor Shane Jacobson as a 'Z-lister' without realising he could hear the conversation.

Speaking on The Kyle & Jackie O Show on Thursday, the 49-year-old radio shock jock said the cringeworthy incident had happened several years ago.

Kyle confessed he was in a 'bad mood' ahead of his interview with the 50-year-old actor alongside co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson.

Unknown to the veteran radio hosts, Shane was silently waiting for his interview on a satellite feed in a Melbourne studio.

Kyle said it had been a hectic morning and claimed one of his 'annoying' producers kept pestering him about his upcoming interview with the Kenny star.

'I screamed at the producer and said, "I don't give a f**k about Kenny the dunny guy! He can wait all f**king day for all I care,"' he recounted.

Jackie, 45, then interjected and reminded Kyle that he had actually referred to Shane as a 'Z-lister', describing the unfortunate incident as 'awful'.

'You called him a Z-lister. You said, "I'm not prerecording this Z-lister. Nobody even knows who he is,"' she reminded him.

Kyle admitted he 'felt bad' after learning Shane had overheard his whole conversation with the producer.

But he said Shane graciously laughed off the criticism, prompting Kyle to confess he would've handled it much differently if it had happened to him.

'I felt for him because I thought if that was me hearing someone, I'd bash them nearly to death. I know I would. I wouldn't be able to handle it,' he admitted.

Jackie said Shane's willingness to brush off Kyle's harsh remarks just proved he's 'the biggest sweetheart'.
