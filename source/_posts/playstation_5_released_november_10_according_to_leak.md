Sony's PlayStation 5 will be launched on November 20, according to an alleged leak by Amazon Japan.   

Amazon accidentally listed and then removed the console's release date, Gizmodo Japan first reported.

Sony's official word on when PS5 will come out isn't more specific than 'late 2020', even though it officially revealed the console back in June. 

The leak comes a couple of days after gaming rival Microsoft revealed the release date for its fourth generation consoles, the Series X and Series S – November 10.

Sony revealed the full design for the PlayStation 5 back in June but it's still yet to reveal an official word regarding a release date

PlayStation 5 and its related accessories go on sale on November 20, Gizmodo Japan's screen captures show. 

'Related products are still accepting reservations on Amazon.co.jp,' the site says.

'Somehow, I think it's very reasonable in terms of time.'  

It's already known that PlayStation 5 will be available in two models – one with a standard a disc drive and a second, 'PlayStation 5 Digital Edition,' without a disc drive.

The latter will likely only play games downloaded over the internet but not physical discs bought in stores.

Both will allow 'lightning-fast loading' and deeper immersion with support for haptic feedback, which applies vibrations to the gamer to match the gameplay.    

As well as the new console, Sony took the opportunity to announce a redesigned controller and a host of accessories, including a wireless charging station for its DualSense controllers, a media remote control, PlayStation-branded over-the-ear headphones with 3D audio support and a new HD Camera with dual 1080p lenses

PS5 accessories include a wireless charging station for its DualSense controllers, a media remote control for those who want to use it to stream video and PlayStation-branded over-the-ear headphones with 3D audio support.

The console will feature an 8-coreA MD Zen 2 CPU, a powerful AMD RNDA 2 graphics processor, 3D audio output and a speedy solid-state drive that will help games load faster.  

Sony also unveiled a range of new games, including entries in familiar franchises such as Resident Evil Village, Gran Turismo 7, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Horizon 2: Forbidden West, and Spider-Man: Miles Morales. 

PS5 owners will get an online multiplayer Grand Theft Auto Online completely free at launch. 

When the PS5 is released this holiday season, it will find itself up against Microsoft's fourth-generation Xbox range, which consists of the Series X and slimmer, cheaper Series S.  

The flagship Xbox Series X is priced at £449, while the compact version, the Xbox Series S, will retail at £249. 

Both the Xbox Series X (left) and Series S (right) will be available on November 10. Pre-orders for both begin September 22

Both will launch November 10, Microsoft confirmed on Wednesday, and pre-orders begin on September 22.

The devices will also be made available through its Xbox All Access programme, allowing players to split the cost across 24 months from £20.99 a month. 

Microsoft has said the Series X is the most powerful console it has ever made – featuring processing power twice that of the current generation Xbox One X. 

The fourth generation Xbox consoles have backwards compatibility, which allows them to play games from older consoles. 

The feature means gamers will have access to thousands of titles across four generations of content – from the original Xbox, released in 2001, to 2005's Xbox 360 and 2013's Xbox One.
