Seat's Ateca has been named by experts as the best second-hand car you can buy this year.

The versatile SUV took the crown in the What Car? Used Car of the Year Awards, with it receiving a stamp of approval from road testers for its spacious and well-equipped interior, class-leading handling, large boot and value for money.

But a large family-size SUV isn't for everyone. What if you're in the market for a city car or even a sporty convertible number? 

Fortunately, there's a list of the best models in each of 18 categories - and a budget-friendly choice for those who don't want to pay through the nose for a second-hand motor.

Second-hand star buy: What Car? says the Seat Ateca is the best used model on the market this year, offering great driving performance as well as practicality and reliability 

The Ateca, which only launched to the UK market in 2016, is the outright winner this year, being highly commended by What Car? for its strong line-up of efficient engines and an excellent reliability record. 

Its panel of experts made their selections based on all-round ability, reliability, value and the availability of desirable versions, then decided from a shortlist which models in each of the segments should be the winners. 

Mark Pearson, used cars editor at What Car?, described the victorious Ateca as 'an immensely likeable family SUV that can now be bought for less than half what you'd need to buy one new'.

The Ateca also won the top prize in the used family SUV of the year category. 

Mr Pearson added: 'None of the other category winners could match its combination of all-round desirability, practicality and affordability.

'We're delighted to award it the top gong. That it impressed us so much on its launch and it's still doing so today just goes to show how exceptionally good it is. It's a great used buy.'

Expert road testers endorsed the Seat SUVs range of strong and frugal petrol and diesel engines

Inside, the Seat feels modern, though does lack the high-quality interior of German rivals. While there are a lot of hard plastic materials, it does mean the cabin is durable and should stand the test of time

The Ateca was given a big thumbs up by What Car? for its practicality, including a capacious boot

While the Ateca received a glowing report form the consumer title, it isn't for all car buyers.

Some drivers will be looking for vehicles of different sizes and budgets. And for these buyers it has suggested top performers across the market. 

Luxury brand Audi topped four of the categories - more so than any other manufacturer - with the A4 winning used executive car of the year, and the A8 (luxury car), Q7 (luxury SUV) and TT (coupé) also picking up second-hand awards.

BMW, Hyundai and Skoda joined Seat in winning two categories each. 

Despite the impact of Covid-19 bludgeoning the automotive sector with significantly shrunken demand for new models, appetite for used cars has remained stable - and the desire for electric and hybrid vehicles is rising. 

What Car? named the current and previous-generation Nissan Leafs as the battery cars to have, while Hyundai's Ioniq took the hybrid crown.  

In addition, DS won the award for best used car scheme for the second year running for its 'outstanding' 24-month warranty on cars up to four years old, which eclipses rival offerings.
