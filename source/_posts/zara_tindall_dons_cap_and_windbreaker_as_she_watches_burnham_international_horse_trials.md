Zara Tindall took a break from competing today as she relaxed with her boxer dog Sway at the Burnham International Horse trials in Norfolk.

The Queen's eldest granddaughter, 39, has been pictured in recent days horseback as she competed in the dressage tests at the event.

But today, the royal, who won a Silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics, traded in her riding gear for jeans, a Land Rover windbreaker and black trainers and she laughed with friends while watching the events.

Zara, a mother-of-two, looked cheerful as she donned a matching navy Land Rover hat, and protected her eyes in sunglasses.

The daughter of Princess Anne, who works as an ambassador for Land Rover, went facemask-free and she tied her blonde hair up under her cap.

Zara's deal with the car company is believed to be worth up to £200.

She became an official ambassador for the brand in 2006, strengthening the brand's already impeccable royal connections.

The Queen is thought to have had no fewer than 30 Land Rovers, while they're also driven by all of the Queen's children and most of her grandchildren - as well as the Duchess of Cambridge's family.

She became the first person to be given the keys to a Range Rover Evoque in 2011 and has presented a women’s scholarship, for training in engineering, sponsored by the firm. And every year they sponsor her equestrian competitions.

In 2018,  she used a video interview as a Land Rover ambassador to discuss how she felt getting back on a horse again for the first time since giving birth to her daughter Lena, and announced she hasn't ruled out taking part in another Olympics.

As well as boxer Sway, the family also have  two black Labradors called Storm and Pepper.  

The outing comes as Zara and her former Rugby pro husband Mike Tindall both tested negative for Covid-19.

The couple, who have spent lockdown at their home on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Estate, were filmed taking the tests at the stables on their farm in Gloucestershire.

Both were relieved the tests came back negative, and the Tindalls are believed to have since travelled to Balmoral to see the Queen.

Zara and Mike took the BioSure tests in their role as ambassadors for Manchester-based cyber technology company VST Enterprises.

They then uploaded their results onto their VHealth Passport - which has been developed to help get sports fans back into major events and stadiums - where they appeared within seconds.

Zara winced as the pin-prick test was administered, which detects coronavirus antibodies and was performed under Covid-19 safe practice by Latus Health Care. 

The couple are taking part in a pilot scheme called FANS ARE BACK, which is being put to the government to get football, snooker, rugby, golf and equestrian sports fans back into stadiums and major sporting events next month.

Zara kept warm in a Land Rover cap and jacket. The royal is an ambassador for the branded and is thought to earn up to £200k for her work
