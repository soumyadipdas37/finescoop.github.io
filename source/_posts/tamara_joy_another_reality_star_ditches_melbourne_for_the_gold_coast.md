With Melburnians still facing stage-four lockdown, a number of models and reality stars are ditching the southern state and relocating to sunny Queensland.

And the latest Insta-famous socialite to head north is none other than Married At First Sight bride Tamara Joy.

The 31-year-old announced on Thursday she had 'turned her back' on coronavirus-stricken Melbourne and was hoping for 'bigger and better things' on the Gold Coast.

'Turned my back on Melbourne to focus on bigger and better things. Sorry Melbs, you'll always have a piece of my heart,' she told her Instagram followers. 

'For now though, Gold Coast you're mine! Xoxo.' 

In the accompanying photo, Tamara posed with her back to the camera in a pink bikini, while climbing the stairs of a beachside apartment. 

How the other half live: Tamara's announcement comes as Queensland's borders remain shut due to the coronavirus pandemic, and many Australians are feeling frustrated and envious of the lucky locals enjoying their gated paradise 

Tamara's post comes as Queensland's borders remain shut due to the pandemic, and many Australians are feeling frustrated and envious of the lucky locals enjoying their gated paradise.

Making matters worse is the army of local Instagram models and reality stars who insist upon rubbing their easy-going lives in the faces of their thousands of followers.

Kicking off the list of Insta-braggers is former Bachelorette Ali Oetjen, who spent Monday afternoon posing for envy-inducing photos in Noosa.

'Since being up here in Noosa I've been getting my car professionally cleaned,' chirped Ali as she posed in the sunshine next to her maroon vehicle. 

Beaming in a floaty white shirt and linen shorts, the blonde looked far more serene than how the millions stuck in Melbourne's stage-four lockdown must be feeling.

Elsewhere, Bachelor reject Steph Harper put her backside on display on Monday as she posed for a racy Instagram photo on her Gold Coast balcony.

'Not a bad place to be,' mused the blonde, referring to her idyllic locale.

However, the focal point of the image was not the balcony's view, but rather Steph's physique, which was barely covered by a skimpy black G-string and matching bra.

Fellow Bachelor alum Kaitlyn Hoppe also made her non-Queenslander fans seethe with jealously when she posed for a snap on her balcony overlooking the Gold Coast.

'Blue skies, white highs, won’t blind everything you hide,' wrote the blonde as she preened for the camera in a floral frock. 

Instagram sensation Tammy Hembrow has also been enjoying a similarly charmed existence inside her Gold Coast mansion.  

While Melbourne residents have struggled to cope with curfews and on-the-spot fines, Tammy has been sharing Instagram posts of herself in bikinis at the beach, attending parties and holidaying in the Whitsundays with her boyfriend, Matt Poole.

On Sunday, Married At First Sight's Jessika Power also sparked envy among her fans by sharing a photo of herself attending an exclusive bash in Surfers Paradise. 

Far from appearing concerned about the state of the world's crippling health emergency, Jessika beamed as she posed with fellow MAFS bride Ines Basic and ex-Bachelor stars Stephanie Harper, Charley Bond and Gemma White.

Skye Wheatley - who was slammed for staging a glamorous photo shoot in front of cleared-out toilet paper aisles in Coles at the height of panic buying in March - has also been documenting her fancy-free existence in Queensland amid the pandemic.

On Monday, the former Big Brother star uploaded a racy image to Instagram of herself lounging seductively by the ocean, alongside the caption: 'Feels like summer.'

Steve Irwin's 'hot niece' Rebecca Lobie uploaded a similar bikini photo earlier this month as she enjoyed a leisurely weekend trip to the beach.
