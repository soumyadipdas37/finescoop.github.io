Sandra Bullock has returned to the set of her upcoming Netflix movie after filming was shutdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 

With the crew wearing face masks and shields as they followed Sandra around the set in Surrey, Canada on Saturday, production looked dramatically different than any other film project just six months ago. 

Sandra, 56, was exempt from the mask-wearing as she threw herself into the role of Ruth Slater, a woman struggling to be accepted by society after serving time in prison for a violent crime.

Sandra wore a mustard yellow sweater, a fur lined jacket, jeans, and boots as she briskly walked across the film set with a look of concern on her face. 

She appeared to be talking with another actor, who had a steely expression across his complexion.

Wearing a midnight blue sweater, collared shirt and carrying a brief case, the actor was noticeably more dressed up than Sandra.  

Directed by Nora Fingscheidt, the film boasts a cast of Viola Davis, Jon Bernthal, and Vincent D'Onofrio.

Filming took place in Vancouver, Canada, but was put on hold after the pandemic struck in March, according to the Vancouver Sun.

Sandra plays a recently released prisoner who struggles to be accepted by friends and family following her sentence for a violent crime, leaving her to find her estranged sister, according to Variety.

The untitled film will be Sandra's second time teaming up with Netflix, following her hit 2018 horror film Bird Box.

In the meantime, Sandra has been spending time with her family under lockdown.

The actress has daughter Laila, eight, and son Louis, ten, whom she both adopted from Louisiana. 

She has been dating photographer Bryan Randall since 2015.
