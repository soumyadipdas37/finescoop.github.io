A high school assistant principal has recorded himself saying 'f*** the police' after telling cops 'what a s***y a*** job they were doing' during the Rochester protests. 

Steven Lysenko, a ninth-grade teacher at Spencerport High School, posted the clip on Facebook Live amid ongoing demonstrations over the the death of black man Daniel Prude, who lost consciousness after police held a hood over his head. 

Lysenko tells viewers he has been on a peaceful protest when 'our peacekeepers ended up shooting pepper spray at us for singing and chanting and telling them what a s***y a*** job they were doing'.

He added: 'They can f*** right off America. F*** the police. F*** Rochester police department. Thank you.'

After the footage went viral over the weekend the school district posted to Twitter Saturday to apologize and say it 'will be addressed as a confidential, personnel matter'.

The video sparked outrage among some, with one Twitter user, Jeff Belles, writing: 'Any Spencerport student with a similar rant on social media would have consequences. This is not respectful and encourages hate. Fire him.'

@Mindfullyrude wrote: 'This man is inciting and expressing hate towards law enforcement. Shame on him. Hateful individuals should not be allowed around children.'

But a petition to keep Lysenko at the school had more than 3,500 signatures as of Sunday afternoon.

Lysenko, who describes himself as a 'Husband, Father, Child, Advocate for Social Justice, Educator, Child of God', has been vocal on social media about the Black Lives Matter movement. 

In June he wrote: 'To any students-past or present-who follow me here: know that when you post '#WhiteLivesMatter, you are condoning White Supremacy. In that I will not abide!' 

He earlier apologized on Facebook for using 'police-centric and police-friendly language'.

Spencerport Schools said in their statement on Twitter: 'As we have stated consistently and clearly, Spencerport Central School District stands in solidarity in support of racial equality and systemic change.

'We remain committed to this change, and want all of our families to know we further stand in solidarity with peaceful protesters. However, when a District employee uses language in public or on social media that does not align with our Code of Conduct or demonstrate appropriate role modeling for students, that is something that we will not condone. These statements by our administrator have caused disruption within our school community.

'We apologize to our students, parents and community that you had to hear this language from one of our employees. This will be addressed as a confidential, personnel matter.'

Nine protesters were arrested overnight Saturday in Rochester as demonstrations over the the death of Daniel Prude earlier this year continued for a fourth night.

Three officers were treated at hospitals for injuries they suffered when 'projectiles and incendiary devices' were hurled at them during Saturday night's protests, Lt. Greg Bello of the Rochester police said in a news release.

The Democrat and Chronicle reported that some protesters were hit by projectiles as well as thousands marched through the streets of New York's third-largest city. No information about injuries to protesters was provided by police.

The New York Civil Liberties Union criticized the police use of 'military tactics' including sound cannons, flash bangs, tear gas, and pepper balls against the demonstrators.

'People speaking out are not enemy combatants, and to fire flash bangs, tear gas, and pepper balls at demonstrations against police violence only proves the point,' NYCLU Genesee Valley chapter director Iman Abid said in a statement Sunday. 'The mayor and RPD must stop these warfare tactics now.'

The marches took place as New York's attorney general announced Saturday that a grand jury would investigate Prude's death. 

Prude's death after his brother had called seeking help for his erratic behavior in March has sparked protests since video of the encounter was made public Wednesday, with protesters demanding police accountability and legislation to change how authorities respond to mental health emergencies.

Prude, 41, was naked and handcuffed when he was held down by officers who responded to his brother's call. 

Police body camera video shows the officers covering Prude's head with a 'spit hood' designed to protect police from bodily fluids, then pressing his face into the pavement for two minutes. Prude died a week later after he was taken off life support.

The Monroe County medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide caused by 'complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.' The report cited excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP, as contributing factors.

A police internal affairs investigation cleared the officers involved of any wrongdoing, concluding in April that their 'actions and conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and consistent with their training.' The seven officers were suspended Thursday after Prude's family released the video from the scene.

Mayor Lovely Warren thanked James for taking action in what she called 'a trying time in Rochester.' Protesters have called on Warren and Police Chief La'Ron Singletary to step down over the delay in releasing details of Prude's death.
