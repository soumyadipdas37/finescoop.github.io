A critic of home working has branded people who don't want to go back to the office 'selfish' for denying young people face-to-face contact. 

CEO of We Love Work, Paris Petgrave, south London, appeared on Good Morning Britain today alongside journalist Sally Jones, from Warwickshire, to discuss reports that nine out of ten people want to continue working away from the office. 

Paris insisted that remote working will help local areas thrive, but Sally argued it could be unfair for 'unestablished' and young workers, who benefit from face-to-face mentorship. 

She added that they're less likely to have a home environment, where they have plenty of space to work and a garden.  

Viewers were divided over the issue, and while many agreed with Paris, several felt 'what suits some people' isn't the best option for everyone, and that not being in a physical team-working environment could have implications for younger employees.

Journalist Sally Jones (pictured) Warwickshire, argued it could be unfair for 'unestablished' and young workers who benefit from face to face mentorship 

'I think they are [selfish], said Sally. 'I think really they're only really thinking of themselves. 

'It's great for people like me, who are established with a nice garden and fine for the PRs and the city boys and everyone who can do things online. 

'The young, people on the high street, newsagents, fish and chip shops nail bars. I would love to be going back into the office because those people are losing their jobs, and also the young people who aren't yet set up in their jobs.'  

Sally later went on: 'I think the people who are really going to suffer, the work landscape will never be the same, are the young. 







Some viewers agreed with Sally and felt that it can become 'unfair' when working from home, as many are in more advantaged situations than others







Viewers clashed over the issues, with some arguing that 'times have changed' and the pandemic has simply 'sped things up'

'Because there is so much in work that involves face-to-face interaction. I remember at the start of my career how much I learned from the hands-on mentoring.' 

However Paris felt it's 'ridiculous' to call working from home selfish, arguing that many are spending far more money in their local areas, and insisting that employers have been heading towards remote working 'for years'. 

'It's absolutely ridiculous to say that, said Paris, 'I've spent so much money in my local economy, investing in local coffee shops ordering from Uber Eats. 

'The businesses in my local area are thriving and remote working isn't a new thing, we have been heading there for years and this is part of the future of work, it is part of the new normal, it has been on the cards for years, even pre-pandemic

'So organizations and business in the city need to shift the business model, there are ways of supporting businesses and people who might have a smaller or tricky environment.'  

Viewers clashed over the issues, with some arguing that 'times have changed' and the pandemic has simply 'sped things up' - while others feel that 'what suits some' doesn't suit everyone. 

Agreeing with Paris, one viewer wrote: 'Flexible/home working has been creeping in for some time & organisations have been moving to home/office working location for several years now. The pandemic merely sped it up and forced some organisations to consider it. Times have changed and this needs to be factored In WFH.' 

Another said: 'Nothing selfish at all... The service industry will adapt and change, besides, sorry but I work for me and my family.' 

Sally told hosts Sean Fletcher and Ranvir Singh (both pictured) that working from home could have an impact on younger workers 

Meanwhile, other viewers agreed with Sally and felt that it can become 'unfair' when working from home, as many are in more advantaged situations than others. 

One wrote: 'Where it becomes unfair, is what if you don’t have the house space or privacy to work from home. And inexperienced employees makes it harder for them to learn not being in a physical team working environment could have implications. Or for being successful in apply for a job too.' 

Another wrote: 'I can see in time some people will be saying they are suffering mental health issues due to being isolated working from home! What suits some doesn’t others.' 

A third said: 'We have people not wanting to return from remote working, people who have had to remain at the business have had to pick up the slack that the remote workers can’t do so it’s no wonder. They have no consideration for the stress and pressure for those who remain at the business!'
