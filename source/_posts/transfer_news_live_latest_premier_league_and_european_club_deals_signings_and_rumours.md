The transfer window is well underway, with deals coming thick and fast as clubs look to bolster their squads ahead of the new season – which is just over a week away.

Clubs have until October 5 to wrap up their business but complications caused by the ongoing pandemic mean they'll be keen to get their signings in sooner in time for pre-season training.

Though Chelsea have finally got their Kai Havertz deal over the line, there are still a few loose ends to tie up.

Here, Sportsmail's TOBY MILES will provide live updates from Premier League and European clubs as they continue to negotiate and complete signings during the summer transfer window.
