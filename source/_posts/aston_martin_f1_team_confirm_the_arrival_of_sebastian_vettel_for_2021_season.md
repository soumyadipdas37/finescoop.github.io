Sebastian Vettel has been confirmed as an Aston Martin driver for the 2021 season - just hours after Sergio Perez revealed he was leaving the team. 

The four-time world champion suffered a poor season with Ferrari last year, with the manufacturer releasing the 33-year-old earlier this summer. 

He had been in talks with Aston Martin, who will rebrand from Racing Point in 2021, for several weeks after becoming a free agent and is now set to team up with Lance Stroll, the son of Lawrence Stroll - a co-owner of the team. 

Sebastian Vettel has been confirmed as an Aston Martin driver for the 2021 season 

The German became surplus to requirements at Ferrari after a poor campaign last year  

'I am pleased to finally share this exciting news about my future,' Vettel said. 

'I'm extremely proud to say that I will become an Aston Martin driver in 2021. It's a new adventure for me with a truly legendary car company. I have been impressed with the results the team has achieved this year and I believe the future looks even brighter.‍

'The energy and commitment of Lawrence [Stroll] to the sport is inspiring and I believe we can build something very special together.

'I still have so much love for Formula 1 and my only motivation is to race at the front of the grid. To do so with Aston Martin will be a huge privilege.'

Vettel is set to link up with Lance Stroll at his new team, set to rebrand as Aston Martin in 2021

It follows an annoucement from Mexican Perez that he would be leaving Racing Point after playing a key role in helping the team, previously known as Force India, from going out of business in 2018.

Perez said: 'Everything in life always has a beginning and an end, and after seven years together, my time with the team will come to an end after this season.

'It hurts a bit as I bet on the team during very rough times. We managed to overcome obstacles and I am very proud of saving the jobs of several of my team-mates.' 

Perez revealed his departure ahead of this weekend's Tuscan Grand Prix after seven years

'I'll keep the memories of the great moments lived together, the friendships and the satisfaction of always giving my all. 

'I will always be grateful for the opportunity given to me by [former owner] Vijay Mallya, who believed in me in 2014 and allowed me to continue my F1 career with Force India.

'To the current administration, led by Lawrence Stroll, I wish nothing but the best in the future, especially with the upcoming Aston Martin project.'
