Carrie Underwood has become one of the biggest names in country music, since winning season four of American Idol in 2005.

And the seven-time Grammy winner has frequently shown her appreciation for the women who came before her.

She paid tribute to Dolly Parton, Patson Cline and other queens of country Wednesday, as she performed a medley of hits at the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards.

The 37-year-old dazzled in a red floral gown, as she marked the 95th anniversary of the historic Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, where she took the stage.

She prefaced the song, speaking to the empty audience: 'Patsy and Loretta, Martina and Barbara, Reba and Dolly. These strong voices mean so much to me and to all the other female artists who stand on their shoulders.

'They are some of my heroes, and I am so honored to stand alongside them as a fellow member of the Grand Ole Opry. It's my pleasure to pay tribute to these legendary ladies as we celebrate the Opry's 95th anniversary.'

Carrie launched into Cline's Crazy, before transitioning into Loretta Lynn's You Ain't Woman Enough, Barbara Mandrell's I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool and Why'd You Come in Here by Parton.

She also squeezed Reba McEntire's The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia and Martina McBride's A Broken Wing into the medley.

The Cowboy Casanova artist made her predecessors proud when she beat out male nominees Luke Bryan, Eric Church and Luke Combs for Entertainer of the Year.

She tied with Thomas Rhett for the honor, which was a first for the prestigious award show's 55-year history.

Carrie and her fellow nominees previously opened the awards show with a medley of their own songs, as she performed Before He Cheats.

She put on a stunning display in a sparkling gold mini dress with billowy sleeves, as she sang into a matching gold microphone.

The Last Name artist was also nominated for Female Artist of the Year, which was ultimately awarded to Maren Morris.   

Carrie took to Instagram before the show, as she put rollers in her hair, while getting ready in some leopard-print leggings from her line CALIA by Carrie, writing: 'Getting ready for tonight! Let’s do this, @ACMawards!' 

After a five month delay, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, this year's show was moved from Las Vegas to Nashville for the first time, with no live audience.

Performers like Carrie hit the stage at three iconic locations for country music, including Grand Ole Opry, Ryman Auditorium and the Bluebird Cafe.
