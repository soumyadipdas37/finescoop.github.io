The grieving parents of a baby girl who died after being run over by the family's 4WD have told of how they broke the devastating news to her young sister and brother. 

Anna Seagren, aged 17 months, was killed when she was hit at the family's farm on Victor Harbor Road in Mount Jagged, South Australia, at about 3.45pm on Friday. 

'I saw her as soon as I made the mistake so I knew that she was gone,' said heartbroken mother Jessi Seagren.

Jessi had taken the vehicle to pick up her eldest daughter, Grace, from the bus stop when the tragic accident unfolded. 

South Australia Police said late on Friday night that paramedics had tried to save the girl at the scene, but sadly she could not be revived.

Jessie and her husband, Danny, then had to face the unbearable task of telling their other young children Grace, five, and three-year-old Jack that they would never see their little sister again.  

'We've told the other kids that she's an angel now and she's not going to come home anymore - but we can still talk to her and we love her, and that we were lucky to be her parents for those 17 months,' Jessi told Seven News Adelaide.

Jessi and Danny reached out to warn other parents who think it can never happen to them, pleading with them to slow down, don't rush and to give their babies an extra last cuddle.

'We just didn't see her come out,' Jessi said.

The parents told of how much they loved their beautiful little girl who completed their family and have said how much they would miss her. 

'She was really cheeky, really cuddly and affectionate. She was just a perfect, happy, boisterous, gorgeous girl,' Jessi told Adelaide Now. 

Shattered at their loss, the Seagrens remembered the happy tot for her cheerfulness and playful nature.

'She loved going on the motorbikes. 'She loved the chickens. She would chase them around,' Mrs Seagren said.

'(And) she loved her swimming lessons. She was learning to kick her legs.'

Anna was 'best mates' with her brother Jack and copied everything he did.

They said their baby girl will be 'really missed'.  

One child is run over in their own driveway across Australia each week, according to South Australia's Department for Infrastructure and Transport.

More than a third of children aged under six who died in crashes were killed 'off road' in yards, car parks and driveways. 

In Australia, one toddler is run over in their driveway every week.

On average, seven children die each year

90 per cent of those killed aged under five 

60 are seriously injured after being hit by a motor vehicle at home 

 70 per cent of those injured are aged under five

 TO KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE YOU CAN:

 Always supervise, hold their hands, when a vehicle is to be moved 

Put the children in the car when you move it  

Encourage children to play in areas far from the driveway 

Limit access to the driveway with fencing or gates

Know your car's blind spots
