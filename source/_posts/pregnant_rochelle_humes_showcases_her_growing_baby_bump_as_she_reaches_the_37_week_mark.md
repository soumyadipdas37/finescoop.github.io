She's weeks away from welcoming her third child with husband Marvin.

And Rochelle Humes took to Instagram on Saturday to give an update of her growing baby bump as she reached the 37 week stage.

The TV presenter, 31, looked incredible in a cream cable knit co-ord - the same ensemble she's worn to document her growing stomach throughout her pregnancy.

Rochelle flashed a warm smile at the camera as she pulled off a number of poses with her top pulled up, displaying her bare baby bump.  

The beauty kept her brunette tresses loose for the snaps, while she showcased her natural beauty with a neutral make-up palette. 

Captioning the images, Rochelle, who is expecting a baby boy, revealed how 'proud' she was having carried her unborn child.

She penned: 'And just like that I’ve cooked a full term baby. I know he’s not here yet but I’m feeling proud and 3rd time round I’m still in awe of what the human body can do.

'My favourite line when Marv asks me what I’m doing is “Growing a human, what are you doing?”  #37weekspregnant.'

Rochelle is also mum to daughters Alaia-Mai, seven, and Valentina, three, whom she shares with JLS star husband Marvin Humes, 35.

The couple married in 2012 at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire.

Earlier this month, Rochelle celebrated the beginning of her maternity leave as she enjoyed a night out with her husband.

Later Rochelle changed into a gorgeous paisley printed blazer dress as she and husband Marvin enjoyed their first weekend alone together in months, with the pair donning their matching bathrobes for a cute selfie. 

Earlier in the week Rochelle celebrated the beginning of her maternity leave after a busy few weeks, which included guest-hosting This Morning during the summer break.

The former singer previously Rochelle reflected on how her body has changed since learning she was pregnant with her third child.

Speaking to The Sun on Sunday's Fabulous magazine, she said: 'These boobs have grown out of nowhere! They're just massive! I don't know what to do with them. I've got back ache constantly and I didn't have that before.

'With my first two pregnancies, my boobs grew, but not like this. This is a whole new thing. Even though it's the third time, I'm definitely just getting used to this new body.'
