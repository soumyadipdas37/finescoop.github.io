The first picture of a murder victim whose body was found on fire on a south London street has been released by police.

Loeike Guei, 23, lived on Thornton Heath but was found on fire at 6.12am on Thursday, September 17 at Commonside East in Mitcham. 

Officers attended and the body of a man was found. His family are aware and are being supported by specially trained officers.

The death is being treated as suspicious. A post-mortem examination began yesterday and gave preliminary cause of death as a head injury.

At this time, no arrests have been made.

A crime scene remains in place and enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances.

The Met's Specialist Crime Command is investigating, led by Detective Chief Inspector Wayne Jolley.

He said: 'Loeike's family have been intensely shocked by the loss of their loved one and are at the very beginning of coming to terms with their grief.

'Foremost in our thoughts are their welfare – they are being supported by specially trained officers and we ask that their privacy is respected at this terribly sad time.

'We are in the initial stages of our investigation and are keeping an open mind with regards any motive.'

The force has been making 'good progress' with 'a number of leads' but want anyone else who saw anything to come forward.  

'What I need now is for anyone who has not spoken to us yet but have seen any suspicious activity or vehicles in the vicinity to make contact with us immediately,' he added.

'You may have information that may seem insignificant but could prove crucial to our investigation. 



'What matters most is that you make the call. Loeike's family are traumatised and we need the support of the public in bringing them justice.'

Tania Marszalek, 39, who lives on the road where the body was found, told the Sun: 'My dogs woke me up at around 6am.

'I was annoyed they had woken me up before my alarm and I checked outside to see what was going on - I saw a police officer tying a red tape cordon to the wing mirror of my car.

'I immediately wanted to know what was going on and I asked the officers who didn't tell me much at all.

'There are people on the street who are saying a guy was found at the end of the road on fire after being mutilated, he was still alive when he was found.'
