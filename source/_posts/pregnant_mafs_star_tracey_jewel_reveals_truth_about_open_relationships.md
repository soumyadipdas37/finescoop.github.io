Tracey Jewel is currently expecting a child with her partner Nathan 'Nate' Constable.

And now the former Married At First Sight star has revealed whether or not she'd consider getting into an open relationship with her lover.

Appearing on former co-star Dean Wells' new YouTube show Dangerous Ideas, the 37-year-old gave a very surprising answer when pressed on polyamory.

''I'm fine with open relationships': Pregnant Married At First Sight star Tracey Jewel has revealed whether she'd try out an open relationship with partner Nate Constable (pictured)

'I'm fine with open relationships if they're consensual and everyone's on the same page and it works for them, good for them,' she said.

'I'm at the stage in my life where personally, that doesn't work for me and I'm really happy in the relationship that I'm in.'

She added: 'But I have no judgement on other people.'  

Earlier in the interview, the Tracey said that life's never been better since she fell pregnant.

'After MAFS I went through a really hard time with some anxiety and the readjustment and all of that,' she said.

'I bumped into Nate who was actually my high school boyfriend from 20 years ago, and two years later we're now happily pregnant and life is great, he's amazing.'

Tracey, who is already a mother to 10-year-old daughter Grace, also said that she's always wanted a second child, but 'didn't know if it was on the cards for me'.

The wellness entrepreneur announced her baby joy with Nathan on September 19.

'We're having a baby! We are so happy to share our beautiful news with everyone,' she wrote on Instagram.

'I have always believed in second chances and my second baby I've been waiting so long for,' she added. 

'I bumped into Nate who was actually my high school boyfriend from 20 years ago, and two years later we're now happily pregnant and life is great, he's amazing,' she gushed. 

'My daughter Grace is going to be an amazing big sister and I'm so so grateful to be experiencing pregnancy and motherhood again with my love Nate x.'

She also posted a picture of her ultrasound and a baby onesie that read: 'Coming soon.'

The baby is Tracey and Nathan's first child together. She shares her daughter Grace, nine, with her ex-husband, Jacob Anthonisz.

While the pregnancy may come as a surprise for some, Tracey revealed she wanted to have a child with Nathan in January last year.

'I definitely want more children, a hundred per cent! I'm only 36, I've got quite a few years left,' she told WHO magazine.

'I decided that going forward I definitely want kids so I need to be with someone where that's an option. That door is open and that's really important to me.'
