Crystal Palace captain Luka Milivojevic missed the vital sudden death penalty in an incredible shootout to allow Bournemouth through in the Carabao Cup second round.

The two sides couldn't be split in 90 minutes, and it took 21 penalties to find a winner in the shootout at the Vitality Stadium.

After all 20 outfield players scored, both goalkeepers missed - and then Milivojevic's second penalty was saved by Asmir Begovic.
