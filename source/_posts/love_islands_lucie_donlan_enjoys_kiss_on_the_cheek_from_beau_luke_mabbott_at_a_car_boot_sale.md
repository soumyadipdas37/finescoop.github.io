They've been going strong since publicly announcing their relationship in July.

And Lucie Donlan, 22, appeared to be smitten with her beau Luke Mabbott, 25, as they enjoyed a stroll around a car boot sale in Redcar on Sunday.

The former Love Islanders wrapped up warm for the outing in their winter coats, with the Justin Bieber lookalike even planting a tender kiss on his girlfriend's cheek.

Lucie cut a stylish figure as she looked at the bargains on offer in a pink and blue rain coat which she paired with some light ripped denim jeans.

The blonde beauty completed her relaxed ensemble with a grey beanie hat and pair of black Converse trainers.

Luke also opted for a laid-back look in a black tracksuit and trainers, adding a splash of colour to his outfit with a sage green hat under his hoodie.

It appeared as if Lucie found a gem at the boot sale as she was seen carrying a small blue plate as the couple made their way out of the event at Redcar Racecourse.

It comes after Luke shared a snap of himself cuddling with Lucie on the beach after a surf session in Newquay.

Posing with his arms wrapped around the stunner as he sat behind her, the 25-year-old also dedicated a few gushing words to his belle.

Captioning the image, the handsome reality star wrote: 'In life it’s not where you go, it’s who you travel with... I’m so lucky and forever grateful to have you @lucierosedonlan And yes... we live in wetsuits!' 

Responding to her beau's post, Lucie wrote under the snap: 'Your so special to me... bring on making more memories with you.' [sic]

All smiles: The couple appeared to be in good spirits as they chatted to pals during the day

It comes after Lucie went public with her Love Island beau Luke at the start of July.

Soon after the announcement, Luke branded the surfer his 'partner in crime' in a sweet social media post.

The former heating engineer and the model looked loved-up as they shared a hug on the beach during a romantic surfing trip in Yorkshire.

Luke and Lucie sported matching wetsuits as they put on a cosy display in the image uploaded to the hunk's platform, which he captioned: 'My partner in crime.'

The surfer commented: 'Youuuu' with a heart-eyed emoji, while fellow Love Islander Luke Trotman, who confirmed the pair's romance days earlier, cheekily wrote: 'Double date but no surfing.' (sic) 

Just hours after going Instagram official, the Luke's ex-girlfriend Demi Jones – who he was partnered up with on Love Island's winter 2020 series – appeared to make a thinly-veiled dig at her co-star as she liked a tweet about being 'better off alone'.
