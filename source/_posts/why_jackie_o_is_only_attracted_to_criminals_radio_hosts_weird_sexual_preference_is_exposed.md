She became one of Australia's most eligible bachelorettes after splitting from her husband Lee in 2018.

And on Tuesday, Jackie 'O' Henderson revealed her bizarre sexual preference, which also seemingly confirmed why she hasn't been able to find her Mr. Right. 

Speaking on her KIIS 106.5 breakfast radio show, the 45-year-old admitted that she has noticed her wandering eye for criminals.

Acquired taste: Jackie 'O' Henderson revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Tuesday that she's only attracted to criminals  

'When I look at news stories and see pictures of people who the articles are about, I would say 98% of the time the hot guy always turns out to be the felon,' she said. 

'I see the picture and say ''he's hot, what's he about?,'' Oh, he’s another criminal,' she laughed off.

The mother-of-one went on to explain that she is concerned about her growing attraction to criminals, and doesn't want to end up with a bad boy.

'It's really worrying Kyle, I don't want to end up with someone like that,' she said.

In an attempt to expose Jackie's wild side, her co-host Kyle Sandilands arranged for a group of males to appear in the studio for her to pick out the best looking men.

Each line up contained two males who didn't have a criminal past, and one that did.

'It's really worrying Kyle, I don't want to end up with someone like that' she said 

But luck wasn't on Jackie's side, each time choosing the man with a 'criminal' past.

Kyle, 49, didn't appear shocked by her results, instead telling Jackie: 'Just fall into it... You know what it’s like...'

'A lot of my friends wanna bang you too even the ones in jail,' he continued.
