Manchester United lost their only match of pre-season on Saturday but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was still able to pluck two crucial positives. 

Donny van de Beek and Dean Henderson are the only new faces welcomed into United's dressing room so far this summer, with both getting involved as United lost 1-0 to Aston Villa in Birmingham. 

United kickstart their Premier League campaign next Saturday against Crystal Palace and Solskjaer was buoyed by the performances of his new arrivals. 

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was pleased with his two new boys' first outings of this season

Dean Henderson impressed despite Manchester Unites suffering a 1-0 loss to Aston Villa

New £40m man Donny van de Beek also featured and Solskjaer was delighted with his showing

'There were some positives,' the Norwegian told MUTV. 

'I thought Deano showed his authority back there and he played like a proper Man United goalkeeper. 

'Donny was maybe the biggest plus in the outfield. He's such a finder of space and he creates time for himself with his timing and movement. 

'I was very happy with his performance.'    

United could on fit in one pre-season match after their long Europa League run into August

Henderson is set to challenge for David de Gea's spot after the Spaniard's drastic dip in form

Midfielder Van de Beek arrived for £40m from Ajax while Henderson has finally broken into the Old Trafford first-team after two seasons on-loan at Sheffield United.

The 23-year-old keeper is set to challenge David de Gea for the No 1 spot this season, after the Spaniard's poor form last term led Solskjaer to consider his options.  

United regrouped after a short break just two weeks ago, owing to their Europa League semi-final run which stretched into August. 

Solskjaer admitted a number of players 'clearly needed minutes' after the defeat to Villa, with United struggling for a cutting-edge in attack and falling to an Ollie Watkins winner.
