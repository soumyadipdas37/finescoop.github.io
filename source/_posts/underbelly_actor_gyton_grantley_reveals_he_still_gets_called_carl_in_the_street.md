Underbelly actor Gyton Grantley still gets called 'Carl' regularly on the street, after playing slain gangster Carl Williams in 2008 series. 

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph this week, the 40-year-old admitted the show turned his life 'upside down' with fans still recognising him as the character. 

'I still get called Carl every day when I'm out on the street,' he confessed.

The actor first played Carl Williams in Underbelly in 2008. He later reprised the role for the 2014 spin-off Fat Tony & Co, and most recently in Informer 3838 this year.

Carl Williams was a central gangland figure in Melbourne. He was a convicted drug trafficker and murderer. He was killed while in prison in April, 2010. 

Gyton admitted he is 'done' now with the character. But said when he last portrayed Carl it was like meeting an old friend. 

'It is like catching up with one of those dear old friends you haven't seen for years,' he said.

'You may be a little anxious about how it's going to go and after about 20 seconds you're cracking the same jokes and having the same conversations.'

Gyton is an ambassador for Polished Man, which seeks to address the global scourge of family violence. 

The actor has previously said how the hit show changed his life while speaking to News Ltd back in June, 2018.

'My life got turned upside down overnight. I was famous all of a sudden,' he said.  

'I had paparazzi outside my front door for a few months and everywhere you look there was just eyes.'     

Gyton is married to glamorous wife Alex Ortuso with the pair sharing two kids: Rocco, four, and Sohi, one.
