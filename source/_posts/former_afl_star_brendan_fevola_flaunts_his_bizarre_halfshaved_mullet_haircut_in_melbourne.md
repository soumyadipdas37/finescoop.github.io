He proudly flaunted his bizarre half-shaved mullet on Thursday evening. 

And shortly after debuting his new look, former AFL star Brendan Fevola took to the streets of Melbourne to show off his questionable new 'do.

The 39-year-old was seen out for a stroll amid the city'shard lockdown, dressed down in a white T-shirt and blue shorts.

He also had on his face mask that has 'not today rona' emblazoned across the front.

As he looked down at his car keys, the FOX FM radio host's odd hairstyle was on full display, with Brendan revealing the bare top and sides and the dark curly locks on the back of his head.  

On Thursday, Brendan shared a photo on Instagram showing the bald front of his head and the remaining part of his mane.

He hilariously captioned the snap: 'Looking grouse 2020'.

It comes after Brendan unveiled several dramatic looks back in Melbourne's April lockdown. 

The sports star dyed his hair green and purple to represent his employer's trademark logo.

'New day, new hair style,' he wrote, before offering a spirited plug for his show with co-stars Fifi Box and Byron Cooke. 

'Make sure you are tuning in 6 till 10 Mon to Fri,' he said, adding fans could also download the smart phone app. 

Brendan also informed his legion of fans his daughter Leni did the dye job.

The shock look came after the AFL player, who is normally a brunette, admitted he 'got bored' while cooped up at home and decided to change his hair colour.

After his hair initially went yellow, Brendan later unveiled a lighter blond colour after a second dye attempt. 

'I'm so not posing here,' he cheekily wrote underneath in Instagram post with his peroxide blonde hair.   

Blond Bombshell! He also rocked a platinum blonde 'do

The former Carlton footy star then joked 'just a candid shot of my grouse look', alongside the hashtags 'new hair' and 'blonds have more fun'. 

Brendan claimed he was channeling Eminem's Slim Shady look with his newly bleached hair and said: 'ISO got me doing weird s**t'.
