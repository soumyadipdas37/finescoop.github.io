Gogglebox star Jad Nehmetallah is believed to be one of Channel 10's 'top picks' for the upcoming season of The Bachelor.

And it seems everyone in the TV industry has heard about the rumours, with the exception of perhaps one person: 2019 Bachelorette Angie Kent.

Despite spending two years as co-stars on Gogglebox, Angie appeared to have no idea who Jad was when asked about the gossip in Sydney earlier this month.  

'Who's Jad?' Former Gogglebox star Angie Kent (L) appeared to have a mind blank when she is asked for her thoughts on co-star becoming the next Bachelor. Pictured with Yvie Jones (R)

A photographer asked Angie, 30, if she thought Jad would be a good Bachelor, and she replied: 'Who's Jad?'

'Jad from Gogglebox,' the snapper added, to which she responded: 'I have no idea who you are talking about.'

It wasn't until one of her male companions prompted her that Angie said: 'Oh, right... Yeah... I actually... yeah he would be good.'

Ouch!  In exclusive footage obtained by Daily Mail Australia, Angie, 30, replied: 'Who's Jad?' when asked if she thinks Gogglebox's Jad Nehmetallah would make a good Bachelor

It's possible Angie and Jad never physically met when they were on Gogglebox together because the households film their segments at their own homes and don't record as a group.

However, they almost certainly would have known of each other.

It comes just days after Jad addressed recent speculation he was being considered for next year's Bachelor. 

No clue! In an attempt to help trigger her memory, the photographer replied: 'Jad from Gogglebox,' to which she replied: 'I have no idea who you are talking about'

Speaking to Lifestyle, the 34-year-old said: 'It's insane how many people online and in person have been mentioning it.'

'I am interested in finding love and starting a family but I'm having way too much fun with Matty and Sarah Marie [Fahd] on the couch to do anything else,' he added.

'And Malik's not ready to take over my seat just yet, so I'll be holding onto it for as long as I can!' 

Setting the record straight: Gogglebox's Jad Nehmetallah recently addressed rumours he is being considered as a candidate for next year's season of Channel 10's The Bachelor 

'I've been busy working hard and spending my time working with charities, supporting businesses during COVID,' he continued. 

Jad previously told the website he had imagined his life at 34 would be different.

'I always pictured myself married by now with two to three kids,' he said at the time.
