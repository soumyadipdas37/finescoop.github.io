The Battle of Grunwald took place on July 15, 1410, with Polish and Lithuanian forces on one side and the German Teutonic Knights on the other – experts say there were more than 50,000 soldiers in total.

The feud between the groups was over the Tuetonic's expansion along the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea and the group's greed for power.

Following a gruesome fight, the Polish-Lithuanian army defeated the Teutonic leadership, leaving their fighters either dead or taken as war prisoners.

The victory also allowed Polland-Lithuania to emerge as one of Europe's most powerful states.

'In seven years of our archaeological research we have never had such an exciting, important and well-preserved find,' he stressed.

Many of these amateur archaeologists bring along a metal detector, which is how Aleksander Miedwiedew uncovered the axes.

He discovered the relics in a marshy area of the field, hiding two feet below the surface.

Miedwiedew explained to The First News that the swampy landscape protect the aces from air and corrosion, which is why they looked as if they were just made.

'It was a huge shot of endorphins, adrenaline plus a hundred. It was like flying to the moon,' he said describing the moment he stumbled upon the axes.

'Like crossing a bridge between people from 1410 and us.'

Over the years, archaeologists and volunteers have discovered hundreds of other relics from the Battle of Grunwald, mainly short swords and spear heads used by the soldiers.
