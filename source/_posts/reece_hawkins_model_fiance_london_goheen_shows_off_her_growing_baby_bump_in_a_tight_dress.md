She recently announced she is expecting her first child with fiancé, Reece Hawkins. 

And on Friday, London Goheen showed off a glimpse of her baby bump as she posed while enjoying a relaxing walk in a park.

The 22-year-old American model shared a photo to Instagram, flaunting her trim pins in a tight white mini dress while cradling her growing bump.

In the photo, London smiled for the camera while she gently placed her hand on her blossoming bump.

The raven-haired beauty let her luscious locks cascade down her shoulders, and kept her makeup minimal with a flawless visage, mascara and a plump pink pout.

London and Reece revealed they're expecting a child earlier this month, just weeks after announcing their engagement.

London's post comes after she was slammed for charging followers to see photos of her baby bump on OnlyFans.

She copped backlash on social media after revealing she was going to be charging people $14.99 per month on the subscription service. 

OnlyFans is a subscription-based adult website where content can range from something as innocent as a suggestive selfie, all the way to hardcore pornography.

'She's literally charging people for her OnlyFans to view pics of her bump? What the f**k,' one follower wrote on London's pregnancy announcement.

Another person commented: 'Wow sis is really charging $9.99 per month to see her pregnancy photos lol.' 

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia earlier this month, London defended her decision to show off her baby bump on OnlyFans.

'I have chosen to show detailed parts of my pregnancy on that platform because I've had to experience harassment and bullying for the last two years over my relationship with Reece,' she explained.

She added: 'I have 100 per cent control of my profile and what people have access to and comment on. I never said it was compulsory. People can choose if they wish to subscribe or not.' 

Reece also shares two children with his ex-partner Tammy Hembrow: son Wolf, five, and daughter Saskia, four.
