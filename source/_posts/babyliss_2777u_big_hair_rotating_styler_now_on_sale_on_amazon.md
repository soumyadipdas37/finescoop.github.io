Juggling a round brush and hair dyer to achieve a salon-style blow-dry from home can be more hassle than it's worth.

For a quick way to add bouncy volume and shine to your hair, a two-in-one streamlined brush and dryer is the way to go. 

Scoring points for performance, ease and cost, the BaByliss Big Hair Rotating Styler is a popular hair tool with Amazon shoppers. The styler allows you to place the barrel right at your root to build volume for a salon-like finish within minutes. And all with just one hand.

The BaByliss 2777U Big Hair Rotating Styler is now on sale on Amazon for only £33. 24 and shoppers can't believe the salon-like results 

What's more, you can now snap up the top-rated styler for just £33.35 on Amazon- a 17 per cent saving and less than a trip to the hairdresser.  

The BaByliss Big Hair Rotating Styler has received over 2,800 ratings on Amazon with shoppers raving about the 'absolutely fantastic results', describing how it 'actually looks like you've been to the salon for a blow out'.

The popular hair dryer brush is Amazon's Choice for 'rotating hair curler' and is being hailed a 'game changer' for salon-worthy blowouts in half the time. 

Combining the drying power of a 700W hairdryer with a stylish rotating brush, the Big Hair styler re-creates the volumising technique used by the hairdressers but in an easy to use design. 

The dryer brush rotates as you style and powers hot air through the body of the brush and vent holes in the brush head, while the soft mixture of boar and nylon bristles creates smoothness and shine. 

Unlike hair straighteners or curlers, you don't have to wait until your hair is completely dry before using the Big Hair Styler- saving you time in the mornings or before a night out. While some shoppers report that it takes a little getting used to, the majority confirm that it's very easy to master after a couple of tries. 

'Within 10 minutes my hair looks like I have had a professional blow-out and it lasts for several days! FYI I bought the 42mm and it is perfect. I have shoulder length wavy thick hair.'

The styler features a 42 mm ceramic barrel that adds fullness and body as you dry, while the soft bristled brush gives your hair optimum shine and smoothness

Shoppers obsess over the hair tool for its ability to create bouncy hair no matter your hair type. 

'I absolutely love it, so easy to use, has saved me so much time. I have thick, coarse, frizzy, long hair, and it usually takes me so much time to straighten. I can never get it looking nice and have to not wash it so often to allow my hair to settle. 

'I can now wash my hair more frequently as styling it is so quick with this styler. I've had compliments, with people thinking I've had my hair professionally blow-dried.'

The BaByliss Big Hair Rotating Styler works well on varying hair lengths, so you don't need long hair to take advantage of the tool.

One happy shopper wrote: 'I've only had mine a week, have a bob which is just below the neck level and already feel I couldn't manage without it - adds volume which stays. Only took a few days to get the hang of it and much faster than using a hairdryer.'

Another agreed, adding how the styler has helped the condition of her hair thanks to cutting down on other hair tools: 'Salon look every time, my fringe has loads of oomph and I now get comments on my hair all the time! Also, it's definitely better for my hair than blow-drying and straightening, my hair seems to be in much better condition.'
