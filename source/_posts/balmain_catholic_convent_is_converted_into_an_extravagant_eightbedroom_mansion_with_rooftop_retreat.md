A Catholic convent has been converted into an extravagant mansion, complete with a gym, 600-bottle wine cellar, eight-metre ceilings and an indoor lift that moves between four floors.

Built by Australian architect Edmund Blackett in 1876, 14c Jane Street in Balmain, in Sydney's inner-west, started life as the Convent of the Immaculate Conception, a school home to 10 nuns and 30 boarders who took lessons in a study hall large enough to seat 300 pupils.

After closing its doors due to financial hardship, a 20th-century renovation divided the school into three private residences before it was restored to its original glory in 2011 as part of a project to preserve historic buildings.

The redesign has transformed the landmark - which is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register as a structure of 'High Local Significance' - into a one-of-a-kind family home with a rooftop entertainment deck overlooking the Harbour Bridge.

Vaulted ceilings tower eight metres above the living room, decorated in a Gothic style in a nod to the building's heritage

Eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms are spread over 702 square metres of internal space - a staggering 482 bigger than the average floor size of a New South Wales home which sat at 220.3 in 2018, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

Vaulted ceilings tower between up to eight metres above the spacious living room and kitchen-cum-dining area, which is fitted with a floor-to-ceiling bookcase, custom timber cabinets and Italian marble.

Other standout features include a self-contained guest apartment, a master suite with its own lounge room and office as well as premium kauri floorboards and cedar doors which run throughout the house.

Outside, multiple balconies jut out over the landscaped garden where a barbecue and dining patio runs along the edge while an ornate fountain acts as centre-piece.

The house is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of 'Gothic-revival' architecture in the Harbour City, where many Victorian-era buildings were demolished by developers and replaced by concrete blocks from the 1950s onwards.

Staircases crisscross between the four floors, with spacious landing areas in between

The property has even greater potential than its current state because it comes with pre-approved planning permission for a swimming pool and space to build a four-car parking garage - a far cry from its humble convent beginnings.

Bresic Whitney listing agent Adrian Oddi said the unique property has already attracted interest from overseas just days after it hit the market with a price tag of $12million on Saturday, September 19.

'The owners have given it a complete overhaul...the buyer pool for this property will stretch well out of Balmain,' Mr Oddi told realestate.com.au.
