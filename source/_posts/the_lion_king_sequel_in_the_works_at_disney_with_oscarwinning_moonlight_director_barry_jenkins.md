Walt Disney Studios is gearing up for a live-action sequel to 2019's The Lion King, Deadline reported on Tuesday.

The Mouse House has tapped Oscar-winning Moonlight director Barry Jenkins to helm the upcoming project, taking over for director Jon Favreau.

The story will reportedly 'further explore the mythology of the characters' from both the 1994 animated film and the the live-action remake like Mufasa, Simba, Nala, and the whole Pride Rock gang.

'Helping my sister raise two young boys during the '90s, I grew up with these characters,' Jenkins told Deadline.

'Having the opportunity to work with Disney on expanding this magnificent tale of friendship, love and legacy while furthering my work chronicling the lives and souls of folk within the African diaspora is a dream come true.'

The 2019 adaptation of the Disney classic starred Donald Glover as Simba, Beyonce as Nala and James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa.

Disney used cutting edge photo-realistic technology to make the animals look like their real live counterparts.
