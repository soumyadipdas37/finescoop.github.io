Brewster and Morfit have been dating since July, just a few weeks after Brewster filed for divorce from her estranged husband, film producer Andrew Form.

Brewster and Form first met on the set of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning and they were engaged in November 2006 and married in March 2007.

Brewster and Form share two children together, seven-year-old Julian and four-year-old son Rowan.

Sources told People that Brewster and Form 'quietly separated' earlier this year, while indicating the split was 'amicable.' 

'They have the utmost respect for each other,' the source said. 'They remain committed to lovingly co-parent their two children as a team.'

Brewster is slated to reprise her role as Mia Torretto in the highly-anticipated F9, the ninth installment of the Fast & Furious franchise.

The film was originally slated for release on May 22, though Universal Pictures pushed it to April 2, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

She recently starred in Hooking Up alongside Brittany Snow, Sam Richardson and Vivica A. Fox, which hit theaters in late March, just before theaters closed due to the pandemic.
