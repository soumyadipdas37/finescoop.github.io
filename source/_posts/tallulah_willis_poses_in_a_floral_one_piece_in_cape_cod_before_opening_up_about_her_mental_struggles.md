Tallulah Willis has been living her best life at her mother Demi Moore's house in Idaho with her boyfriend Dillon. 

The loved up pair have been practically inseparable during quarantine, occupying themselves by doing water activities, having stream side picnics and taking scenic couples photos. 

Last week it appears as if the two made the jump from Idaho to Cape Cod, Massachusetts as the designer and mental health advocate posted dreamy snaps from their picturesque vacation to Instagram.

On Monday, It appeared as if the couple were getting a feel for parenthood as the pair playfully basked in the water with a family friend's child. 

Holding matching sand pails and splashing around, Tallulah, 26, giggled uncontrollably with the young girl as she and boyfriend Dillon all held hands.

The statuesque beauty who has an extensive bathing suit collection, wore a black floral one piece with cutouts on the bodice.

The Wyllis designer captioned the photo, 'pure pure pure elation'. She added, ' ***all 3 water babies have tested negative' referring to their COVID-19 tests results before traveling and seeing friends.

Beauty in strength: Though Tallulah has seemed to be in good spirits these past few months the fashion designer and mental health advocate is always one to candidly discuss how her mood ebbs and flows

The daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, has been very open about her struggles with mental health and even an eating disorder.

Though she has seemed to be in good spirits these past few months Tallulah is always one to candidly discuss how her mood ebbs and flows. 

Switching gears from her ethereal beach snaps, Tallulah bravely opened up to her 332K Instagram followers on Tuesday. 

In honor of September being National Suicide Prevention Month, the brunette beauty Instagrammed a baby photo of herself shot by legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz with a poignant caption. 

 I have low days, and in my lowest of lows, limbs heavy from exhaustion, I have questioned if I have the energy to keep pushing another day. Truly a horrifying sentiment to have swimming in your head. But then I try to remember, I do it for her. I do it because she needs a voice, a champion, a Big Kid; To tell her it’s ok, that she is safe that she is protected. If you look in the mirror and feel like what stares back is not worthy of love and care, if you can’t trust your own intrinsic value as a human being, do it for them. Do it for them until one day, one alarmingly beautiful day, you can do it for yourself. baby Buu shot by Annie #nationalsuicidepreventionmonth
