Aston Villa have turned their attentions to Joshua King after missing out on his former Bournemouth team-mate Callum Wilson.

Villa missed out on Wilson when the forward opted to join Newcastle and are now considering an offer for Norway's King, who scored nine goals for club and country last season.

Boss Dean Smith has not given up hope of signing top target Ollie Watkins from Brentford, even though they have yet to reach the Championship club's £25million valuation.

Smith is desperate to improve his attacking options, both through the middle and wide.

Neither Wesley - who is still recovering from a serious knee injury - nor Mbwana Samatta made a significant impact last season, when Villa avoided the drop on the final day of the campaign.

With their pursuit of Watkins set to go to the wire, Villa want a new man in place by the time they start their campaign against Sheffield United on September 20.

Villa are not in action this weekend as they were scheduled to face Manchester City, who have been given a week's grace by the Premier League due to their involvement in the Champions League last month.
