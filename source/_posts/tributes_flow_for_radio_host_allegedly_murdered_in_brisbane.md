The Brisbane radio community is mourning the death of a presenter and promoter allegedly murdered by two men last week.

Andy Stephens, who also went by the name Andy C, was found dead at his home in Taringa, Brisbane, last Thursday.

Michael Bradley Small and Scott Richard Gordon, both aged 33, were charged with Mr Stephen's murder on Monday.

The 48-year-old was a popular and well-respected figure of the city's underground music scene.

A friend of Mr Stephens said he was 'shocked and upset' in a heartbreaking social media post.

'We are always chatting and to only learn last night is still a shock to my system. I don't want to believe it. You cant be gone, I only just spoke with you,' he said. 

'One thing you will never be forgotten - so many shows and content found online, and (I've) been crying all night listen to content and our voice chats.

'Will f**king miss you man and karma will happen … You will not be forgotten!'

Small appeared via video link to the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday where he was formally charged with one count of murder, the Courier Mail reports.

Gordon also faced court via video link for a brief mention of his own murder charge.  

Police allege the duo killed Mr Stephens on August 30, five days before his body was found in a Waverley Street home.
