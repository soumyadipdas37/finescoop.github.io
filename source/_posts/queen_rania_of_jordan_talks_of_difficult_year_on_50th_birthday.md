It's a milestone that's most often celebrated with a huge party, but all Queen Rania of Jordan wants for her 50th is for her loved ones to be 'healthy and safe and nearby'.

The mother-of-four, who is married to King Abdullah II, 58, is celebrating her birthday today after a 'very difficult year' - with the global pandemic and her country's lockdown resulting in some days that 'seemed to last a lifetime' for the royal.

Speaking to Hello!, Queen Rania said: 'It has been a very difficult year, but I am thankful that my country is doing all it can to limit the spread of Covid-19 within our borders and put our people’s health and wellbeing first.'

Last week, Jordan reimposed some restrictions and extended curfew hours in response to increasing coronavirus outbreaks.

Throughout the country's lockdown earlier this year, Queen Rania's children - Crown Prince Hussein, 26, Princess Iman, 23, Princess Salma, 19 and Prince Hashem, 15 - were with their family, which the mother said was a 'blessing'.

‘Throughout this global crisis, there have been days that seemed to last a lifetime, followed by months that flew by in a haze,’ the royal admitted.

When revealing her birthday wish this year, she said: ‘On my birthday, as long as the people I love are nearby, and they are healthy and safe, I could not possibly ask for more.’

The royal confessed that she usually wished for more time with her husband and their children, but said that ‘time is all she’s had’ this year, adding that they were ‘grateful to be together’.

Queen Rania and King Abdullah II, who got engaged just six months after they first met at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend, have been married since June 1993.

Glamorous Queen Rania went to school in Kuwait and studied a business degree in Cairo, Egypt, before marrying into royalty.  

She paid a touching tribute to her husband on their 27th wedding anniversary in June.

Taking to Instagram, the mother-of-four shared a heartwarming snap where she was captured smiling and walking hand-in-hand with King Abdullah II.  

Captioning the post in Arabic and English, she penned: 'How could you not fall in love with that smile, over and over again for 27 years! So lucky and grateful to have you by my side, happy anniversary. #Love #Jordan #LoveJO.'
