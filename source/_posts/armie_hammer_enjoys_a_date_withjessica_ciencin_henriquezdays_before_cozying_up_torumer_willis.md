But in May, Jessica seemingly ended things with the Sweet Home Alabama star for good when she posted a scathing message to Twitter, accusing the actor of 'cheating.'

'Having a child with someone makes you want to forgive them more than you usually would, it makes you believe they are better than they are,' she began.

'But it takes a really sh*t human to cheat on their partner (correction: now ex partner) in the middle of pandemic.

'Thank you for reminding me why I left you in the first place. I deserve better than this. Our son deserves better than this,' read one portion of Jessica's emotionally charged post.
