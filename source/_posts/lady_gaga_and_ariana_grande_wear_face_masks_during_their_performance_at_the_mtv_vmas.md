Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande put on a fierce performance at the 2020 MTV VMAs on Sunday evening - easily stealing the show.

Marking a bizarre return to awards season amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the event was filmed over days at several different locations with production abiding by social distancing guidelines as it aired 'live' 

The event was initially tipped to be hosted from Brooklyn's Barclays Center however a change in plans saw the show shifted to pre-records, despite MTV claiming much of the show would remain live. 

The showstopping set was a medley of Gaga's songs including 911, Rain On Me, and Stupid Love, from her hit album Chromatica.

Making a statement on abiding by safety guidelines, Gaga, 34, wore a LED face mask throughout her set, as well as Ariana, 27, who wore a black silk mask, as she joined her for their hit For Rain On Me.

Making a statement: Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande perform in face masks at the 2020 MTV VMAs in New York City on Sunday evening

The pair wore similar outfits to that of the video for Rain On Me, which was a big winner on the night. 

The performance was kicked off by Gaga under a blanket as she watched a TV, which teased a performance by Britney Spears and N*Sync from an old MTV VMAs event.

She then got up from the couch and began singing the track 911 from her latest album, before Ariana also came on stage with her.

Singing it out: Ariana belted her notes through a black satin face mask

Trailing them in the glam stakes was Miley Cyrus who came out swinging - quite literally - as she performed her song Midnight Sky from a giant mirror ball. 

Miley, 27 wore a very skimpy outfit for the performance of the song, which she sang live.

The pop star is known for making a big splash at the event, having previously caused an outcry when she performed in latex bra and pants alongside Robin Thicke back in 2013.

Showing off her long legs while holding on to a chain, Miley belted out her tune as she put on a spirited performance. 

The Weeknd opened the show with a performance of his hit song - Blinding Lights - on the rooftop of the Edge, which is the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere.

The Canada-born star came into the night with six nominations including Artist Of The Year, and five for the song's video: Video Of The Year, Best R&B, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Direction by Anton Tammi. 

Looking bloodied and bruised to match the cover of his latest studio album After Hours, the hitmaker kicked things off seemingly passed-out, laying on the ground in a pre-recorded clip.

As the intro to the song progressed, The Weeknd stood up to reveal his 1980s-era ensemble of black pants, red blazer and black shirt and tie.

The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.

This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines.

MTV explained its plans for the show to ‘[span] all five boroughs’ of New York, to ‘pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.’

Nominations this year were dominated by pop performers Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, with nine nods each, while Billie Eilish and The Weeknd followed closely behind with six each.

They all appear in the top prize category, Video of the Year, which finds Eilish's Everything I Wanted going up against Eminem and Juice WRLD's Godzilla, Future and Drake's Life Is Good, Gaga and Grande's Rain on Me, Taylor Swift's The Man, and The Weeknd's Blinding Lights.

Lady Gaga isn't exactly a wallflower when it comes to red carpet events, but at the 2020 MTV VMAs, the superstar singer totally stole the show! 

With the help of stylist Nicola Formichetti, she wore looks by the likes of Area, Valentino and Iris van Herpen (and of course some seriously fierce face masks!), but it was this emerald green ensemble by Christopher John Rogers that really made us swoon. 

It looks like a ballgown, but it's actually a taffeta skirt and matching top, and we love the voluminous shape and kimono sleeves. The designer is one to watch, and Lady Gaga is joining an elite list of fans - Michelle Obama and Tracee Ellis Ross for starters! 

This Autumn/Winter '20 collection look will soon be available exclusively at NET-A-PORTER (click right to be ready and waiting with your credit card), but for now, make them green with envy in a Gaga-inspired gown from our edit below.
