She became a mom for the first time back in May.

And on Sunday, Chloe Sevigny, 45, enjoyed an outing in downtown Manhattan, New York, with her five-month-old son Vanja and her boyfriend Sinisa Mačković.

The star of HBO's Big Love showed her fashionista credentials in a blue shirt dress paired with black cowboy boots.

The dress had a thigh-skimming ruffled hem and she left the top button of the collared number undone to reveal a gold pendant necklace.

She had on statement sunglasses along with a disposable face mask and carried a black purse. 

Mačković opted for a baggy dark red pinstripe shirt and black shorts and also wore a mask.

The couple started dating in 2018 and confirmed the arrival of their first child together via social media on May 2. 

Sevigny recently admitted to W Magazine that going out these days, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, makes her anxious. 

'I would say that my neuroses around that have really amped up because of the small child and my mother,' she told the publication. 'I guess it’s not even neuroses at this point, it’s just what everybody is doing. It’s common.' 

She added that she gets annoyed when out with her son when people pass by who aren't wearing face coverings.

'I like to push him around in the stroller, and a lot of people walk by shouting without masks on. Like, just put it on! Is it that hard?' she said.
