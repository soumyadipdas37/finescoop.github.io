Alex Reid's fiancée Nikki Manashe has revealed that she is 'excited and petrified' as she starts IVF treatment again as she must self-isolate until she is 28 weeks pregnant.

London-based Nikki, 35, and Alex, 45 - the ex-husband of glamour model Katie Price - have suffered five miscarriages and have already undergone four IVF cycles in their journey to become parents. 

The IVF blogger described how she has 'always wanted big family' and the couple are hoping to transfer two of their four embryos which raises the possibility of twins. 

Honest: Alex Reid's fiancée Nikki Manashe has revealed that she is 'excited and petrified' as she starts IVF treatment again as she must self-isolate until she is 28 weeks pregnant



Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'I am excited and petrified which is such an oxymoron but I am. 

'There are no words. I cannot explain it - it is amazing but extremely frightening.

'I am putting my body through so much and it is so painful - emotionally and physically.' 

Distance: The blogger is forced to self-isolate for five months, up until she is 28 weeks pregnant, due to the immune-suppressing nature of the medication

Nikki, who has a high number of natural killer cells that causes her body to 'fight pregnancy like an infection', must undergo intralipid drips to bring down the cells. 

Therefore the blogger is forced to self-isolate for five months, up until she is 28 weeks pregnant, due to the immune-suppressing nature of the medication.

She said: 'I have to self-isolate on my own I can see friends and family from a distance but I have to wear a visor and a mask - I can't even go to the supermarket or see Alex.

'All of the different scans go on until November to prepare my body for becoming a mum and bringing down my natural killer cells - which is what they believed made me miscarry and without them diagnosing that I would miscarry again.

'It has taken many many years to find a reason why and I pray to God this is why.'  

Yet Nikki described how she is trying to 'keep as numb as possible' in order to 'protect' herself after her previous cycles have resulted in devastating heartbreak.

She said: 'It is excitement versus reality when it comes to IVF - I am trying to keep as numb as possible. I am trying to protect myself. 

'Every time I have got excited and passed every hurdle and got pregnant we have had the scans and seen the heartbeat and everything has gone perfect and then it doesn't. 

'I am literally taking tomorrow as it comes because mentally I think I wouldn't be able to cope.' 

In it together: The couple plan to transfer two of their four healthy embryos, following a series of scans, that are 'ready and waiting' for them which raises the possibility of twins

Nikki said: 'The next huge question is how many embryos to put inside my womb. I think we are going to go with two. 

'There is a huge possibility of twins. That would be amazing. I have always wanted a big family.

She added: 'I have always said to Alex I would like to use the embryos we have then I would like to adopt as well.' 

Candid: Nikki shared a picture on herself on Instagram in February with a cannula in her arm captioned: 'One step closer baby Reid. I haven't given up on holding you in my arms'

However Nikki, who has an Instagram page and YouTube channel documenting her IVF journey, also spoke of the hurtful comments she has received on social media.  

She said: 'I don't understand why someone would go out of their way to spread evil and nastiness to someone who is showing such vulnerability and spreading awareness on such a taboo topic. 

'It hurts, I am human and I am extremely emotional and it is a very sensitive topic.'

Speaking about her IVF journey through lockdown, Nikki said: 'It has made me age. I am lot more content with being on my own now.' 

'Lockdown has prepared me for this lockdown. I am not scared anymore and sharing my journey on my Instagram is keeping me sane.'   

The IVF blogger has coached more than 2000 women privately and helped spread awareness, with diet plans and dealing with the emotional journey that comes with IVF.  

Nikki runs the blog, www.ivfchasingdreams.com, and has since started a YouTube channel - IVF Chasing Dreams. 

In September 2019, Alex sadly announced he and Nikki lost their fifth child following another round of IVF. 

The former Celebrity Big Brother star posted the sad news to Instagram with a poignant quote. 

Alex posted a quote which read: 'I never got to hold you or bounce you on my lap. I never got to read to you or watch you as you nap. You slipped away so quickly before I said your name. And I want the world to know, I loved you just the same.'

In-vitro fertilisation, known as IVF, is a medical procedure in which a woman has an already-fertilised egg inserted into her womb to become pregnant.

It is used when couples are unable to conceive naturally, and a sperm and egg are removed from their bodies and combined in a laboratory before the embryo is inserted into the woman.

Once the embryo is in the womb, the pregnancy should continue as normal.

The procedure can be done using eggs and sperm from a couple or those from donors.

Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that IVF should be offered on the NHS to women under 43 who have been trying to conceive through regular unprotected sex for two years.

People can also pay for IVF privately, which costs an average of £3,348 for a single cycle, according to figures published in January 2018, and there is no guarantee of success.

The NHS says success rates for women under 35 are about 29 per cent, with the chance of a successful cycle reducing as they age.

Around eight million babies are thought to have been born due to IVF since the first ever case, British woman Louise Brown, was born in 1978.

Chances of success

The success rate of IVF depends on the age of the woman undergoing treatment, as well as the cause of the infertility (if it's known).

Younger women are more likely to have a successful pregnancy.

IVF isn't usually recommended for women over the age of 42 because the chances of a successful pregnancy are thought to be too low.

Between 2014 and 2016 the percentage of IVF treatments that resulted in a live birth was:

29 per cent for women under 35

23 per cent for women aged 35 to 37

15 per cent for women aged 38 to 39

9 per cent for women aged 40 to 42

3 per cent for women aged 43 to 44

2 per cent for women aged over 44
