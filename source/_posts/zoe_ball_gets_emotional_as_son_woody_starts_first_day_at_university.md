Zoe Ball bid an emotional farewell to her son Woody as he began university in Bristol on Wednesday.

The radio presenter, 49, was joined by her ex-husband Fatboy Slim, real name Norman Cook, who she shares her son with, and she shared a slew of snaps from their trip after dropping him off.

One snap saw Zoe put on an animated display as Woody smiled with glee and the DJ, 56, posed behind them, while another snap saw father and son pose together in what appeared to be his dorm in student halls.

Zoe and Norman's daughter Nelly, ten, also posed for a photo with Woody, as she wrapped her arms around him.

The teen put on a casual display for the big day as he paired a yellow football shirt with grey jeans, while he also wore a black face mask amid the coronavirus crisis.

Gushing about sending her eldest off to university, Zoe wrote: '#Bristol take care of my best boy. #wooniversity #feels #proudmama LOVE for any emotional parents out there.'

Zoe's posts come after Jamie Oliver shared a heartfelt message wishing his eldest daughter Poppy well as she heads off to university.

The celebrity chef, 45, took a drip down memory lane as he shared a collage of his now 18-year-old daughter as a child. 

Alongside the snaps, Jamie wrote: 'I can’t believe this young lady my first born Poppy has headed off to university, OMG where did that little girl go!?!?

'Emotional and exciting times for young people all around the country in these very strange times I wish you all the best of luck. 

'Good luck Pops love you so much take this great opportunity and run like the wind!!!! Love Dad x x x x'. 

The pictures included Poppy blowing out the candles on a cake and wearing a pink crown hat on her eighth birthday.

Along with Daisy, Jamie is also father to Daisy, 17, Petal, 11, Buddy, nine, and River, three, with his wife Jools, 45.

The businessman recently admitted that homeschooling his children during lockdown had been 'misery'.

Jamie said while some of his brood were given plenty of work to keep them going throughout lockdown, other teachers have left him to fill in the gaps himself. 

He explained: 'I had one kid that had really good home-schooling and one that was kind of left to it. 

'I think for parents all around the country, home-schooling has been a blend of misery and... and misery.'

Hands on: Jamie has had his hands full, juggling Poppy, Daisy, 17, Petal, 11, Buddy, nine, and River, three, with his wife Jools (pictured in 2016)

In June, Jamie celebrated 20 years of marriage to wife Jools.   

Jools shared a shot of herself letting loose on the dance floor during their 10-year wedding anniversary celebrations.

Taking to Instagram, the author uploaded the fun-filled image, which showed her heavily pregnant as she donned an off-the-shoulder ivory gown.  

As she hit the floor with both hands in the air, her pals were putting on an energetic display, including actor-turned-filmmaker Dexter Fletcher, 54.

Captioning the shot, mother-of-five Jools wrote: 'Just found this @jaseflem123 @dexfletch @ellyflem 10 years ago at our wedding anniversary....best moves jase (little buds in my tummy 8months pregnant..think this may have been a dance off).'
