Rumer Willis transformed into a Kim Kardashian lookalike in her latest album of Instagram videos this Wednesday.

The resemblance was apt as the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore was advertising Kim's shapewear line SKIMS.

She posed up a storm in a skintight black bodysuit in front of a massive display comprised of several of Kim's glamour posters.

The ad appears to be part of Kim's star-studded one-year anniversary campaign for SKIMS, which includes such names as La La Anthony and Addison Rae.

Rumer emphasized her sculpted midriff and shapely legs in the sizzling outfit as she shot her best smoldering stare at the camera.

An old-fashioned rotary phone set was sitting on the floor beside Rumer and she held the phone itself to her ear as it rang away.

Eventually someone answered Rumer's call and a female voice could be heard on the other end of the line saying: 'Hello?'

She aimed a pensive gaze at something off-camera, tilting her head to one side and wearing her long curly black hair free. 

Bruce and Demi, who also have two other daughters called Scout, 29, and Tallulah, 26, have been divorced since 2000. 

However they have stayed friendly and in fact even turned heads by going into self-isolation together in Idaho with their daughters early in the coronavirus lockdowns.

They were later joined by Bruce's current wife Emma Heming with whom he shares his daughters Mabel, eight, and Evelyn, six.

Scout appeared on the Dopey self-help podcast in late April and revealed why Emma had waited to join the rest of the group in Idaho. 

'My stepmom was going to come up here too with my little sisters. [But] my younger sister… [who has] never gotten a talk about not f***ing with hypodermic needles…. she found [needles at a park and] she actually tried to poke her shoe with it and poked her foot,' Scout revealed.

'So my stepmom had to be in LA waiting to, like, get the results for taking her to the doctor. My dad came up here early and then travel got crazy and my stepmom stayed in LA with my little sisters.'

She said during that podcast episode, according to Us Weekly: 'It’s been really funny having both my parents at the this house where they, like, raised us,.'

Scout, who like her parents and sisters is sober, shared: 'It’s kind of divine time to just hang out with them. … I’m very grateful to be with my family.'
