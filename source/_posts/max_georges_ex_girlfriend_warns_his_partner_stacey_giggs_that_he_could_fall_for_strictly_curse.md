Max George's ex girlfriend has warned his new partner Stacey Giggs that he could succumb to the 'Strictly curse' after he reportedly dumped her over the phone. 

According to The Sun, Carrie Baker has claimed Max, 32, would revel in the attention of other women, including Jennifer Lopez and Amy Willteron, when they were together. 

The claims come in stark contrast to a friend of Stacey's who has insisted the couple are not worried about Max falling for his partner on Strictly Come Dancing.

Max's ex Carrie, who dated him for five years, told the publication that he previously asked her father for permission to propose but later changed his mind.

She also claimed that he would down 16 pints a night and regretted getting engaged to actress Michelle Keegan because he was drunk when he proposed. 

She said: 'I wouldn’t like to be in her shoes. Everyone knows what Strictly is like — and I know what Max is like. He’s a serial flirter. 

'I thought I was going to marry him and have his children. I’ve never been in love like that and it broke my heart when he left. He handled it all wrong and ­people need to know the truth.'

Max is said to have got Carrie pregnant but she later miscarried and he moved on with Stacey, 41, after their relationship ended.  

Carrie and Max met in February 2014 in LA bar Rock And Reilly’s where she was working as a waitress and he was trying to crack the US market as a solo artist. 

The beauty queen admitted she was immediately attracted to The Wanted singer and invited him to a party after her shift and they hung out 'all night'.

Carrie said she had moved into his one-bedroom apartment near Sunset Boulevard only weeks later and became pregnant during their first year together but sadly lost the baby.

Carrie said: 'I wouldn’t like to be in her shoes. Everyone knows what Strictly is like — and I know what Max is like. He’s a serial flirter'

She also said that her ex would go to the pub four nights a week and tell her he was planning on only having one or two drinks but could end up having up to 16.

Carrie told the publication that Max did not want her to accompany him to red carpet events in case it would upset his female fans, however she would later see photos of him out with other girls, including a brunch with model Amy Willerton.

Max insisted nothing happened between them and Carrie also claimed Jennifer Lopez's manager got in touch, saying she wanted to meet him. 

Carrie, who is studying to become a nurse, said Max became stressed about money so the pair moved into her mother's Las Vegas apartment in 2017 to save for their own place.

She explained that Max would travel back and forth to the UK for work and she came to Britain to spend Christmas with him in December 2018 where everything seemed alright.  

However, in February 2019 Carrie said she received a tearful call from Max telling her that she deserved to be happy and he couldn't give her that while living in England.  

Two months later, her mother informed her Max had a new girlfriend and Carrie went online and saw it was Stacey.

Carrie claimed mutual friends told her he first got together with Stacey while they were still seeing each other but Max promised her he didn't start dating Stacey until after they had already split.

Carrie said she can't see the couple being happy together and claimed Max called her in secret from his friend's phone last December but she is now over him and does not believe anything he says.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Max George and Michelle Keegan for comment.  

It comes after a source close to Stacey told new! magazine that she and Max are not worried about the infamous Strictly curse. 

The source said: 'They’re very solid. He’s totally smitten with her. Everyone goes on about the Strictly curse, but she’s not worried at all. 

'They trust each other totally. They’ve got a very good, strong relationship and she’s very supportive of him.

'It was her idea. She told him, "This could be great for you." She’s so supportive of Max. Behind every successful man there’s a strong woman and Stacey is that. She wanted him to do this.'

In July, Max told how he hoped to marry Stacey, who is the ex wife of footballer Ryan Giggs, one day and have children.

He told The Sun: 'I've always said I've wanted kids but never committed to it in my own head but I think Stacey's the one. 

'We would love to add to the family at some point, that would be amazing. Obviously there are no guarantees but I'm sure we both feel the same way.'

The couple recently enjoyed a holiday to Spain where they were joined by Stacey's children Liberty, 17, and Zach, 13. 

Back in March, it was reported Stacey was shopping for a new £1.5million house with Max, following one year of dating, after putting the £3.5million pad she shared with her ex Ryan up for sale.

Stacey reportedly invited The Wanted singer to move in with her at her Worsley home, near Manchester back in October, after seven months together.

A source told The Sun: 'Stacey was planning to move before she met Max because the house was getting too big for her but now things have moved on so quickly they've decided to buy somewhere together.

'She was cautious that things were moving too rapidly at first, but they are absolutely head-over-heels in love. She's never been so happy – ever.'

Stacey's relationship with the singer is her first reported romance since she parted ways for good from sportsman Ryan, whom she split from in 2017.

Ryan and Stacey finalised a £40million divorce after he cheated on her with Big Brother star Imogen Thomas during their 10-year marriage.

The Welsh football coach also had an eight-year relationship with his brother Rhodri's partner Natasha throughout the duration of his marriage.
