New Chelsea signing Thiago Silva has opened up on meeting the young fan who shot to fame by rapping a song in his honour during last year's Glastonbury Festival.

Teenager Alex Mann went viral after he was plucked from the crowd to join artist Dave on stage, before reciting every word of the song 'Thiago Silva' while wearing a Paris Saint-Germain shirt.

Later that summer, the youngster was invited to Paris to meet Silva, who signed the jersey and relived the famous performance.

'It was a very unusual situation because I had never heard of the song before,' Silva said.

'This video of the lad Alex coming out of the crowd wearing my shirt, he got on stage and sang the song with all the other artists and it went viral.

'Of course, it arrived to me in Paris and I then got the opportunity to meet Alex and thank him because sometimes us footballers lose the idea of the influence and reach that we have.

'So I was really happy, it was pleasing that there's a song with my name. I remember that day well.'

Silva is expected to make his Chelsea debut in the Carabao Cup against Barnsley this week
