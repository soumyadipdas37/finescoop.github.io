A $79 white kitchen trolley from Kmart with multiple storage compartments is being praised by customers across Australia.

The trolley has a table top, drawer, wine rack, basket, side hooks and is built with wheels that can be locked into place.

Several shoppers shared images to the Kmart Homes, Ideas and Hacks Facebook group to reveal how the trolley has helped save kitchen space and add style to their homes.

'Loving my white kitchen trolley, ideal for small houses,' Jeanette said online and placed her air fryer and milkshake maker on the bench top. 

Another customer had a similar idea and placed her thermomixer on top and other gadgets at the bottom.

'Brought the white kitchen trolley from Kmart yesterday for the thermomixer, loving the space it gives me,' shopper Shannon said and posted a picture.

The trolley itself is 86 centimetres high and 57 centimetres wide, making it the perfect addition to any kitchen

The hooks on the side can be used to hold kitchen towels, the basket is ideal to store vegetables and the bottom space can store other items or food products such as bread.

The bench top can also be used to hold a small microwave, fruit bowl or plant.

The trolley itself is 86 centimetres high and 57 centimetres wide, making it the perfect addition to any kitchen.

Those who have purchased the product have said it's 'very sturdy' for the price and have been 'surprised' with its good quality form.

'I got the black one, same design and it's perfect for my air fryer,' one woman said on Facebook.

'I'm looking forward to the one I'm getting,' another said.

Others said the product is perfect for those who are renting, have limited space and don't want to spend a lot of money.
