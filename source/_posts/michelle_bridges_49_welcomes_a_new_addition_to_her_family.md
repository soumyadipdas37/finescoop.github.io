Fitness guru Michelle Bridges has welcomed a new addition to the family. 

On Wednesday, the 49-year-old brought home an adorable cavoodle puppy, which she and her son Axel, four, named Banjo.

Michelle shared a slew of photos of their furry friend to Instagram, and wrote: 'The Adventures of Banjo. Yes I'm crazy... but oh so in love.'

The former Biggest Loser trainer then shared a second photo of her son cuddling the pint-sized pooch. 

She told her followers: 'Okay, I've been questioning myself, being a single parent, trying to run businesses, trying to give my son the most grounded wonderful life and run a household, as to what the %text@! I was thinking getting a puppy?'

She finished the caption: 'This photo answers it.' 

Michelle has been running her business empire from Bowral, after moving out of her former marital home in Sydney earlier this year following her split from ex-partner Steve 'Commando' Willis.

But the ex-Biggest Loser star hasn't let her training regimen slip, and flaunted her toned torso while shooting promotional content for her activewear range, MB Active, last month.

Bonding: 'Ok. I've been questioning myself, being a single parent, trying to run businesses, trying to give my son the most grounded wonderful life and run a household, as to what the %text@! I was thinking getting a puppy?!?!??!!!??,' Michelle wrote

'Back at it! And SO happy to be too! Today's photo shoot was for my new range... it’s form meets tech meets cool,' she captioned her post shared to Instagram.   

In the accompanying snap, Michelle showed of her toned physique in a maroon crop top and matching leggings. 

The mother of one looked ageless wearing flawless foundation, pale pink eyeshadow and lashings of mascara.

It follows a tumultuous year for Michelle, who split from Commando in January.

The couple began dating in 2015, after splitting from their respective partners, and welcomed their son, Axel in December that year.

They announced their split in January this year. After their break-up, Michelle was arrested for drink driving on Australia Day and was later convicted.

She was fined $750 and had her licence disqualified for three months, after pleading guilty to mid-range drink driving.

A tearful Michelle said outside court: 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep remorse, shame and humiliation [over] this incident and extreme lack of judgment.

'I would like to apologise to my family, friends and community for this gross error in judgment and the consequences of these actions will haunt me forever.'
