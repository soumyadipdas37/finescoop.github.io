This year's Academy of Country Music Awards is a bit different, as the COVID-19 pandemic means no live audience.

But the biggest names in country music are still putting on a glam display for their fans watching from home.

Carrie Underwood put her hair in rollers Wednesday, as she, Miranda Lambert, Gwen Stefani and other celebs got ready for the star-studded 55th annual awards show in Nashville.

The 37-year-old got cozy in leopard-print leggings from her line CALIA by Carrie, while curling her gorgeous blonde locks in a trailer, writing: 'Getting ready for tonight! Let’s do this, @ACMawards!'

She's set to perform during the show, at which she's nominated for Entertainer of the Year and Female Vocalist of the Year.  

Lambert, 36, shared a video to her story from the hair and makeup chair, as she rocked a floral blouse and jammed out to a cover of I Say A Little Prayer.

She teased her performance, which took place in a local cafe, writing: 'Glam jam prep! Tune in tonight for Bluebird at the @bluebirdcafetn'

Lambert previously won her 35th ACM Award, which was announced before the show, taking home Music Event of the Year for Fooled Around and Fell in Love.

Hopefully, she'll be able to social distance from ex-husband Blake Shelton, 44, and partner Gwen Stefani, 50, who are set to perform their new duet Nobody But You. 

Stefani showed off her look beforehand, taking to Instagram with a boomerang of herself running in place, writing: '@acmawards tonight w @blakeshelton'

Ready to go: Stefani, 50, showed off her look beforehand, taking to Instagram with a boomerang of herself running in place, writing: '@acmawards tonight w @blakeshelton'

Stay gold: She donned a white denim jacket with gold fringe down the sleeves, over a white top with gold chain necklaces and matching bangles. The Hollaback Girl artist paired the jacket with matching cut-off white denim short shorts, also featuring gold fringe

Supportive spouse: She also included a gif of Shelton, showing support for her partner, who's nominated for four awards, including Song of the Year for God's Country

Romantic duet: The couple also prepared to perform their new duet Nobody But You at the awards show

She donned a white denim jacket with gold fringe down the sleeves, over a white top with gold chain necklaces and matching bangles.

The Hollaback Girl artist paired the jacket with matching cut-off white denim short shorts, also featuring gold fringe.

She finished the ensemble with some black fishnet stockings, which were tucked into a pair of knee-high gold stilettos.

Stefani did some twirls, as she hung out around her hair and makeup trailer, comparing the look to Marilyn Monroe's famous white dress.

She also included a gif of Shelton, showing support for her partner, who's nominated for four awards, including Song of the Year for God's Country.

Nicole Kidman, 53, supported husband Keith Urban, 52, from afar, as he hosted, performed and was nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year.

She posted a video of herself watching him speak on her laptop, as she enjoyed the show from home in Australia, writing: 'Wishing I was there, but streaming @KeithUrban on the #ACMawards here in #ByronBay'
