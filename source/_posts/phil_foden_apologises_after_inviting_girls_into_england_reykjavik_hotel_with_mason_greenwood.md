Phil Foden has now spoken out after being axed from the England senior squad for inviting girls into the team hotel in Iceland, along with Mason Greenwood.

The youth pair made arrangements with an Icelandic model and her friend to come to the official team hotel, which was under quarantine rules.

Foden and Greenwood have been ejected from the England squad as a result by manager Gareth Southgate, and now the Manchester City youngster has issued a statement via social media to apologise for his actions.

Phil Foden, pictured here on a snapchat taken by one of the young women invited to the England hotel, has apologised for his 'poor decision' after being axed from the senior squad 

Foden took to social media on Monday evening to issue a full apology to everybody involved

Writing on Twitter on Monday evening, Foden said: 'Following the story which has emerged today regarding my actions in Iceland, I want to make a full apology.

'I apologise to Gareth Southgate, to my England team mate, to the staff, supporters, and also to my Club and family.

'I am a young player with a lot to learn, but I am aware of the huge responsibility I have in representing Manchester City and England at this level.

One of the women was videoed while on the phone to Foden and Greenwood, making plans

'On this occasion I made a poor decision and my behaviour didn't meet the standards expected of me.

'I breached COVID-19 protocols put in place to protect myself and my England colleagues. As a consequence I will now miss the opportunity to travel to Denmark with the squad, and that hurts.' 

It is understood that Foden is now concerned about how this event will affect his England status long-term, along with his standing in the City senior team. 

After the story came to light, footage soon emerged online via social media of the girls speaking on the phone with the England players, arranging to meet.

In the video the Icelandic girls, one of whom is 20-year-old model Nadia Sif Lindal Gunnarsdottir, ask how the stars are going to sneak them into the hotel.

At the other end of the line, Foden could be heard responding: 'What you coming to the hotel for?', before Greenwood appears to say to his team-mate in the background: 'what do you think?'

Later footage then shows the footballers with the model and her cousin and best friend Lara Clausen, a 19-year-old law student. 

England U23 boss Aidy Boothroyd has also had his say on the matter, telling Sportsmail: ‘I’m surprised and disappointed. Young people can be naïve but without knowing all the facts it’d be difficult for me to go into any detail.

‘I’ve been banging on about stretching talent and that’s what I believe in. Good players need to be progressed. This incident isn’t anything to do with the playing side of things.'

Boothroyd went on to outline how conversations would now be had within the junior England ranks - which Foden and Greenwood had graduated from - in order to warn players against these kind of reckless actions. 

‘We’ll be having a conversation about it with the leadership team (Ben Godfrey, Tom Davies, Eddie Nketiah) tonight and then with the rest of the lads as well.'

Icelandic police have now fined both Foden and Greenwood 250,000 Icelandic Krona (£1,300) for the rule breach during the coronavirus pandemic, which must be paid by the individuals themselves and not by the FA or their clubs.
