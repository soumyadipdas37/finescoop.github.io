A pair of Ukrainian sailors' pork predilection will see them punted from Perth after five kilograms of prohibited pig products were seized from their bags.

The biosecurity breaches will see them booted from Australia and likely banned from returning for three years.

One man failed to declare almost 2kg of raw pork fat, 660 grams of salami and 100g of pork rind.

He also had 870g of fish that hadn't been gutted, 350g of other fish and 340g of chicken in his luggage.

The man's fellow traveller failed to declare 2.2kg of pork meat and fat.

The pair arrived last Friday on a flight from Singapore to Perth, where they were hoping to quarantine for two weeks before linking up with a commercial ship at Fremantle.

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said the men were the 13th and 14th people to have their visas cancelled under beefed up biosecurity laws since October 2019.

'Each of the items seized could pose a direct threat to our agricultural industries and environment,' he said on Tuesday.

'Australia will not tolerate people putting our world-class clean, green reputation at risk by failing to declare food on arrival in Australia.'
