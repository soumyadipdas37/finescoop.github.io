A Range Rover driver filmed the moment four police officers surrounded him on his own driveway in front of his wife and newborn baby.

The man, named Robert, exploded into an expletive-ridden rant when the police officers pulled up to his house in Point Cook, in Melbourne's south-west, on Wednesday.

His friend posted the video to Facebook, saying it was the third time the man 'has been harassed by these f**king clowns', over some 'little social media posts'.

Footage shows Robert sitting in his car in front of his house waiting for the police officer to come to his window and filming them in his rear-view mirror.

A police officer introduces himself and says he is from the Public Order Response Team before asking Robert for a driving licence.

'I don't have my driver's licence on me... I can give you my name,' he responds.

'Do you want to call any more f**king police because this is f**king harassment. I don't understand any of your laws and I don't understand any of your sh*t'.

He claims the police 'followed him down the road' and stopped outside his house and informs them they are filming.

The police officers continue to stand around the car as they question him.

'This is the best for me, and thank you for the harassment,' Robert yells before an officer asks if he's finished.

Robert then goes on a rant about how the police are 'paedophile protectors' and questions why he has been pulled over.

A police officer responds: 'We saw you driving a motor vehicle on a highway'.

The response sends him into a rage and gets out of the Range Rover.

His wife, who is carrying his newborn baby, comes to stand next to him and also films the encounter.

Robert then films all the police officer's names before questioning again, why he was pulled over.

When an officer tells him he was pulled over for 'driving a motor vehicle on a highway' he responds saying it 'isn't an offence'.

'We didn't tell you it was for any offence, we just wanted to check your driver's license,' another officer says.

Robert continues to demand the police get off his property, but they remain standing where they are.

'This is harassment,' his wife can be heard saying in the video.

'You're a bunch of gutless cowards that pick on old ladies and people,' Robert yells.

'That's right, get the f**k off my property. I told you my name, if you didn't listen then you can f**k off.'

The police try to explain to him that there are no charges and they just came to talk to him but Robert continues to yell and tell them to 'get off' his property.

'You gutless piece of paedophile protecting f**ks. That's right, remember who you work for,' Robert yells.

'Wait until the public wake up and take you on. Wait until that happens then you'll experience real fear, you gutless piece of sh*ts.'

His wife tells him to go inside but Robert continues to walk up and down the street yelling 'paedophile protectors'.

'Save the children, they're trying to harass people,' he yells in his rant.

The footage was posted to Facebook on Wednesday and has quickly garnered more than 1,000 reactions and 1,500 comments.

Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they had been made aware of the video.

'Police are aware of a video circulating on social media where a man abuses police members after being intercepted driving a motor vehicle in Point Cook yesterday,' a spokesperson said.

'Victoria Police reminds all drivers that the Road Safety Act requires that they must state their name and address and produce their driver licence when requested to do so by a police officer.'
