Chris Cuomo is becoming quite the social media star thanks to his 17-year-old daughter Bella, who is helping propel her dad to TikTok fame by featuring him in her viral dance videos. 

The latest father-daughter clip sees the duo getting into a fun play fight, with Chris pretending to throw a punch at his daughter, before busting out some disco-inspired moves while taking on a viral dance routine to Ne-Yo's hit Because Of You. 

50-year-old Chris's appearance in his daughter's latest video is by no means the first time he has joined her on the social media app, however it still prompted a flurry of excitement from her followers - with one even proclaiming that they 'love Bella's dad more than their own'.  

Take that! CNN host Chris Cuomo, 50, threw a punch at his 17-year-old daughter Bella during a funny play fight that was filmed for her TikTok 

Back at ya! The teenager shoved her dad in the clip, which saw the pair filming a viral dance routine to Ne-Yo's hit Because Of You

The video begins with Chris and Bella backing towards one another, while their dog jumps up in between the two of them. 

They then purposefully collide, before spinning around to face one another, with Bella playfully shoving her dad in the chest, prompting him to swing at her, throwing an impressive right hook towards his daughter - who ducks to miss it. 

With big smiles on their faces, Bella and Chris then bust into the choreographed dance, which has taken TikTok by storm over the last week. 

First they bump forearms, before turning towards the camera and rolling their arms in a disco-style move, then snaking their heads in opposite directions, remaining perfectly in-sync the entire time. 

In her caption, Bella joked that the family's rescue dog Alabama 'wanted in on' the dance, thanks to the pup's enthusiastic response to the duo's dance moves. 

'The dog desperately needs some attention, I can relate,' one commenter joked about the pup's attempts to join in the dance.  

But while Alabama certainly put on a spirited show, it was Chris who won the majority of fan in the comments section, with hundreds of people chiming in to voice their admiration for the news anchor. 

'Bella sweetie I am so sorry but I'm in love with your dad,' one person wrote. 

Another added: 'I love your father more than my own.'    

Woah: The dance, which has gone viral on TikTok over the past few weeks, sees the participants backing into one another before pretending to get in a fight 

Busting some moves: After their play fight, the father-daughter duo began dancing to the beat - while their dog Alabama jumped up in the background 

Popular: Bella's TikTok followers went wild for the clip, with the CNN host earning a legion of admirers in the comments section 

Wholesome: Others praised Chris and Bella's close bond, with one person commenting, 'This is freaking adorable' 

One person simply wrote: 'Is your dad single?' 

Some even called for Chris to set up his own TikTok account, rather than simply making cameo appearances in his daughter's videos.  

However others focused on the more wholesome nature of the video, praising the close bond between Bella and her dad, with one writing: 'That father daughter relationship goals.' 

'This is freaking adorable,' another chimed in.   

Chris, who has been married to his wife Cristina since 2001, has made multiple cameos in various videos shared by his daughter, and always seems to attract a legion of fans whenever he appears in the brief videos.   

Earlier this month, the CNN host once again wowed Bella's followers when he appeared in the background of one of her videos, showing off for her fans and followers by flexing his biceps while she performed a trendy dance routine. 

Bella, who is the eldest of Chris's three children with wife Cristina, didn't make any hints about her dad's surprise appearance in the caption of the video - simply writing, 'Dance dance revolution' while posting the clip. 

In the video, Bella is seen standing in what looks like the family's home gym at their Long Island property, leaning over to start her camera recording, before stepping back to begin her dance to Kendrick Lamar's Money Trees. 

Putting on a show: Earlier this month, Chris wowed Bella's followers by boldly flexing his muscles for the camera in the background of one of her videos 

Flexin': The CNN host appeared to have just finished a workout at the family's Long Island home, and was seen wearing a cut-off T-shirt and a baggy pair of shorts 

Muscling in on the action: Bella, who is Chris's eldest child, was performing a popular dance to Kendrick Lamar's Money Trees when her dad suddenly appeared in the frame 

There is a man standing behind her at the start of the clip - and just seconds after she starts dancing, her dad wanders into the frame, looking as though he has just completed a workout. 

But while Chris has showed off some of his smoothest moves on his daughter's TikTok in the past, he neglected to join in the routine on this occasion, and instead began flexing his bicep as she continued the dance. 

 Fan club: Chris has appeared in a few videos on Bella's TikToks over the past few months

Wearing a black cut-off T-shirt and a pair of baggy shorts, a rather sweaty Chris gazes at the camera for a few seconds, with a rather confused look on his face, before lifting up his arm to show off his muscles. 

He continues flashing his biceps for the camera as Bella finishes up her dance - even when another woman sticks her head into the frame to see what he's doing.  

But while Chris's friend seemed less than impressed with his flexing display, Bella's TikTok followers couldn't wait to express their delight over the quirky clip.  

Within minutes of the teen posting the video, hundreds of people had commented on the clip - with many sharing their deepest admiration for Chris and his muscles, while others even went as far as to ask Bella whether her dad is 'single'. 

'Chris Cuomo [is] ripped,' one person wrote, while another added: 'Chris is so hot.' 

One particularly enthusiastic Chris fan told his daughter to 'move' out of the way to give her followers a better view of her dad, commenting: 'Girl I love you but move.' 

Others joked about Chris's rather brazen display, with one noting: 'Chris knows what he's doing!' 

Family: Chris and his wife Cristina, who married in 2001, have three children together - Bella, 14-year-old Mario, and 10-year-old Carolina 

Singing and dancing: In April, Chris appeared alongside Bella and Carolina in a fun Mamma Mia-themed video 

Another chimed in: 'Dude [is] yoked out of his mind holy moly.'  

'Am I the only one who didn't know he was this jacked,' one person agreed. 

Even when he was at the end of his battle with COVID-19, the father-of-three found the time to film a video with Bella and her younger sister Carolina, ten, joining the siblings for an all-singing, all-dancing clip that was posted to the oldest Cuomo daughter's account in April. 

In the video, the trio are seen singing along to ABBA hit Angel Eyes - performing the version from Mamma Mia 2, a particularly popular son on the app. But rather than lip syncing to a recording of the song, as many users do, the Cuomo family went all out by singing their own version. 

Carolina and Bella take center stage in the clip, sitting in the foreground of the video while their dad is seen standing in the background - wearing one of his signature baseball caps. 

But as the song starts and the girls start singing, Chris can't resist leaning forward to join them, singing several random lines, before dancing around in the background. 

The father-of-three, who appears to be eating a snack in the clip, throws his hands up in the air and waves his arms around, before the trio lose their place with the lyrics and burst into a fit of giggles. 

Despite the slight flub at the end of the clip, the video proved incredibly popular with viewers, racking up more than 129,000 views and 14,600 likes - while dozens of people commented to share well wishes with the family.
