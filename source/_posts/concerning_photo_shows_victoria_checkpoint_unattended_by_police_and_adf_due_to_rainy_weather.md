Photographs show how a part of Melbourne's ring of steel was left unattended by police because of heavy rain.  

The image shows the Little River checkpoint on the Princes Freeway near Geelong unmanned due to wet weather.

It was captured about 8.30am on Thursday, while cars continued to travel past the dreary and unchecked barrier.  

'Little River checkpoint unattended at the moment due to rain. Police and ADF personnel in their tents,' Mr Templeton's post read.

The picture follows state premier Daniel Andrews setting up a 'ring of steel' around Melbourne, in a bid to prevent residents from travelling to regional Victoria where COVID-19 restrictions have eased. 

Although there are no actual fences in place, police are using checkpoints at major highways, automatic number plate recognition and extra patrols at bus and train stations to catch city dwellers trying to escape strict lockdown. 

Melburnains caught trying to flee could be fined $4,957 for leaving the restricted area and breaching public health rules without 'an appropriate excuse'.

There are seven permanent checkpoints across metropolitan Melbourne, which is currently under Stage 4 restrictions.

Regional Victoria moved to Stage 2 on Wednesday night.

Twitter users reacting to Mr Templeton's post labelled the premier's 'ring of steel' as 'rusty' and dissolving in the rain.

'So let me get this right. When it rains the police and ADF all huddle together in a caravan and a tend. Anyone see a problem here,' one person commented.

'Looks more like a ring of fairly floss to me,' another said.

'#DanOfSteel's rusty ring,' a third person commented. 

Police and ADF personnel were seen manning the checkpoint when the rain stopped and sun came out about 30 minutes later.

The isolation of Australia's second biggest city is similar to the lockdown of Wuhan, the Chinese metropolis of nine million where coronavirus was identified late last year.

Wuhan was shut down on 23 January as all flights, trains and buses in and out were cancelled, and steel fences were set up outside apartment buildings to keep residents at homes.

The lockdown was lifted in April after 11 weeks - four weeks fewer than Melbourne's shutdown is due to last.  

The 'ring of steel' comes as Victoria recorded 28 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday.

The figure is the state's lowest daily total since 24 June.

As part of operation 'ring of steel', officers will check cars with caravans and fishing rods as well as increase patrols at camp sites and national parks to catch any city dweller escapees.

There will also be increased checks at popular holiday destinations, such as the Mornington Peninsula where many well-heeled Melburnians have second homes. 

The major checkpoints were set up on the Princes Freeway at Little River on Wednesday, heading to Geelong and the Calder Freeway near Sunbury on the way to Bendigo.

Premier Andrews is desperate to stop coronavirus spreading from Melbourne to the regions, which have suffered significantly fewer case numbers and were removed from lockdown on Wednesday night. 

He said: 'Whether you want to call it a ring of steel or a border or whatever the term, the key aim is very simple: only those who have to go to regional Victoria and have a lawful reason to go to regional Victoria can go to regional Victoria.

'We've got to be inflexible on this.' 

He added: 'The police are not mucking about. If you are from Melbourne and you are in regional Victoria and do not have an appropriate excuse, you will be fined. 

'Victorians have given a lot but we need to guard the low numbers in regional Victoria.

'Anyone who thinks they might take a punt on heading to regional Victoria and not getting caught, I think your odds are very poor.'

Melbourne's lockdown will last 15 weeks, a month longer than the lockdown of Wuhan (pictured), the Chinese city where the virus was first identified late last year

Mr Andrews also asked pub landlords to check customers' identification to make sure they are not from Melbourne. 

'If you're not from regional Victoria, then you should not be at the pub, and that compliance will be very, very important,' he said.

Victoria was placed back into lockdown on 8 July after coronavirus escaped from hotel quarantine in late May and spread rapidly. 

Some 700 cases were recorded in one day on August 5 and more than 700 people have died, who have mostly been in aged care.

Under Mr Andrews' road map out of restrictions, Melbourne will remain locked down until weekly average cases drop below five, which is not expected until October 26.

This would mean Melbourne's lockdown would have lasted 15 weeks - a month longer than the shutdown of Wuhan.

The four reasons to leave home no longer apply to regional Victoria.

Most workplaces are reopening and schools are returning with staggered starts.

Gathering limits have increased to 10 people outdoors and up to five nominated visitors from another household bubble.

Restaurants are operating with a cap of 10 seated patrons indoors and 50 outdoors. 

Gathering limits have also increase to 10 people at weddings, 20 mourners at funerals and 10 people - plus one faith leader - at outdoor religious gatherings.

Children can return to community sport too, and adults will be able to take part in non-contact sport.

Mr Andrews announced the eased restrictions for regional Victorians on Tuesday.  

'I am so, so pleased and proud of every single regional Victorian who has stayed the course, follow the rules and got tested,' he said.

'There is no greater evidence to the people of Melbourne that this strategy, getting numbers low, is essential.'

Melbourne took its first tentative steps out of lockdown on Monday, with those living alone or single parents allowed to have one visitor, outdoor exercise extended to two hours and the curfew's start time pushed back an hour to 9pm.    

Outdoor gathering limits will increase to 10 people. That number does not include infants under the age of 12 months.

People in regional Victoria will also be able to leave their homes without restriction. 

Limits for outdoor religious gatherings and weddings will increase to 10 people, while funeral limits will rise to 20 mourners.

Five visitors are allowed in a home from a nominated household.

Schools will return to normal operation over the first two weeks of Term 4.  

Outdoor auctions will be allowed to have a maximum of 10 people in attendance.

Children can return to community sport and adults can take part in non-contact sport.  

Regional Victorians can travel and holiday within regional parts of the state - with tourist accommodation in those areas also opening up
