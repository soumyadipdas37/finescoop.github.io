An Australian home baker has impressed other foodies online after sharing how she made delicious scones in her 3.2 litre air fryer from Kmart.

Jezzica, from Melbourne, posted to a popular cookery group and said they were the 'best scones' she's ever made.

The recipe is simple to follow, uses three ingredients and only takes ten minutes to make.

'I could only fit five at a time. When doing [a] second batch, check on the scones after eight minutes,' she said.

To make the fresh scones, Jezzica used flour, butter and milk and preheated the air fryer for five minutes at 200 degrees Celsius.

In a bowl, she first added the butter into the flour and mixed with her hands 'until it resembled bread crumbs'.

She then made a well in the middle of the flour, added in the milk and combined together to create the dough.

After kneading a dough, she made the scones shapes with a two-centimetre thickness and cooked in the air fryer for ten minutes.

The recipe is simple to follow, uses only three ingredients and only takes ten minutes to make, including flour, butter and milk 

The social media post received praise from more than 400 others who were impressed with the simple home baking recipe.

'You can't beat a scone for an easy, yummy snack,' one woman said.

'I'm going to try these tomorrow,' another added.

A third said: 'Scones cook well if next to each other, don't be afraid to squish them in.'

The $69 air fryer has proven to be incredibly versatile over the past few months as amateur cooks have shared their simple creations to others online.
