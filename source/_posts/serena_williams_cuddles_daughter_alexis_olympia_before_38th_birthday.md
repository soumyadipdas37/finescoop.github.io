Serena Williams has quite a weekend ahead of her. 

On Saturday, the tennis champ will celebrate her 38th birthday and just one day later she is set to play in the first round of the French Open.

But, none of those things stopped her from taking a break from training to enjoy some snuggle time with her three-year-old daughter Alexis Olympia in a new Instagram post on Friday.

'Fun times,' the all time great captioned her latest Instagram post.

Serena shared two snaps with her daughter taken at the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy where she has been preparing for the French Open.

In the first snap the mother of one looked down at her little girl adoringly while the toddler was sprawled on a small trampoline.

The second sees the mother-daughter-duo locked in a sweet embrace with Serena planting a kiss on her daughter while she looked up at the camera.

Williams has been hard at work, preparing to face fellow American Kristie Ahn in the first round of the French Open women's singles on Sunday. Meanwhile her sister Venus will be facing off against Anna Karolina Schmiedlová.

Serena recently shared one of the tricks she uses to help get her body ready to play and it is quite chilling.

The star was pictured grimacing while stepping into a frigid ice bath at the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy.

The Academy captioned the shot: 'If you’re not making this face when entering an ice bath, are you even doing ice bath?'

Big weekend! Not only will Williams play in the French Open this weekend, she will also celebrate her 38th birthday

Like the Olympic gold medalist that she is, Serena managed to ignore the pain from the icy waters and flash a megawatt smile to the camera. 

The French Open is following strict health and safety protocols due to the COVID-19 pandemic after its original date was delayed for the same reason.

Unlike the recent US Open, the French Open isn't using the typical American 'bubble' model and will allow fans to sit socially distanced in the stands.

'Up to four people in a single party will be able to sit adjacent to one another. Seats on the outside courts will be open, but there will have to be at least one empty seat between spectators,' ESPN reported about safety protocols (Pictured at the US Open)

Adding: 'Everyone older than 11 will have to wear a mask or face covering at all times, and there will be hand sanitizer dispensers installed all around the stadium.'

Also, unlike at the US Open when Serena and other elite players stayed in private residences, players can only stay in one of two designated hotels in Paris, according to Yahoo. 

During the US Open, Serena was cheered on in the stands by her husband, Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, their daughter.
