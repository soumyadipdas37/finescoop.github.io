The husband of Government minister Chloe Smith is a Covid-19 conspiracy theorist who has called coronavirus a 'mental illness'.

Sandy McFadzean attended Saturday's march in London along with 10,000 other anti-vaxxers protesting against lockdown measures.

The ex-paratroop officer also retweeted a poster for the march, which called for no track and trace, an end to social distancing and no facemasks.

Minister of State for the Constitution and Devolution Ms Smith - who is MP for Norwich North - has supported the government's policies against coronavirus and changed her Twitter name during the pandemic to reflect the government message of 'Stay Alert, Save Lives'.

However, Mr McFadzean denies the existence of Covid-19, writing on Twitter: 'Government need to be clear. Either there is a killer virus on the loose or there isn't. (Spoiler alert: There isn't)'.

In July, he wrote: 'Covid-19 is most likely an outbreak of mental illness.'

Mr McFadzean wrote on Twitter: 'Government need to be clear. Either there is a killer virus on the loose or there isn't. (Spoiler alert: There isn't)' In July, he wrote: 'Covid-19 is most likely an outbreak of mental illness.' Above, his Twitter account, which was deleted yesterday

More than 10,000 Covid-19 conspiracy theorists who believe the virus is a hoax gathered in London's Trafalgar Square on Saturday to protest against lockdown restrictions and vaccination programmes

Mr McFadzean also mentioned StandUp X in one Twitter post - a group which believes coronavirus will force vaccinations on people for the benefit of pharmaceutical companies and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

His account was deleted on Wednesday afternoon after Ms Smith, 38, was contacted by her local newspaper, the Eastern Daily Press reported.

Signs at Saturday's march, which was led by conspiracy theorist David Icke, also included a poster calling for Mr Gates to be jailed, along with Ms Smith's colleague, health secretary Matt Hancock.

More than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who believe coronavirus is a hoax gathered for the 'Unite for Freedom' rally which started at noon in the capital.

The demonstrators called for an 'end to Government lies' and the restoration of all freedoms as they marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament.

Previously, Mr McFadzean retweeted posts describing the government as 'globalist puppets' and 'tyrants'.

One post he retweeted swore at the government for announcing fines on people who joined mass gatherings.

The vice president at bank Credit Suisse also retweeted a post comparing the arrest of one of the march organiser's, Piers Corbyn, to the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. 

Mr Corbyn, brother of former Labour leader Jeremy, was arrested and fined £10,000 after the march for the offence of holding a gathering of more than 30 people in an outdoor place.

Other speakers included David Icke, who believes coronavirus is linked to 5G technology.

Norwich South Labour MP Clive Lewis said: 'There's absolutely no way I'd hold anyone responsible for the views of their partner.

'However, if my partner was spouting forth a load of Covid conspiracy, anti-vaccination nonsense, it is very likely the subject might come up for discussion at some point over tea.'

Chloe Smith proposed to her future husband in 2013 after a four-month romance.

She said at the time it was 'love at first sight' when she met the former soldier at a charity event.

'I just loved the way Sandy talked,' she said in 2013. 'I was instantly attracted to his really relaxed manner and we just hit it off straight away. 

'We share a great interest in the way the world works and what makes people tick.'

Mr McFadzean, a financial consultant, said at the time: 'One of the features of our relationship is that we have quite clear views on equality and we are a very equal couple. We realised really quickly that we wanted to be together.' 

MailOnline has contacted Ms Smith for comment. 

Chloe Smith was first elected in 2009 at a by-election following the resignation of Labour MP Ian Gibson, and was the youngest MP in the Commons at the time at 27.

In October 2011, she was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury in a move that surprised many and allegedly happened because then prime minister David Cameron believed she was a trained accountant.

She was formerly a management consultant for Deloitte.
