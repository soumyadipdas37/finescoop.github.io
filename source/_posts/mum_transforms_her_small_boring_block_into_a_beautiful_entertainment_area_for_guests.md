A mum has revealed how she transformed her 'small boring block' in her backyard into a beautiful entertainment area for guests - and she did the whole thing for just $7,500.

Australian woman Amie Mejia said she had been quoted between $11,500 and $12,000 by a carpenter to sort her outside area, but knew she didn't want to spend that much.

Instead, Amie and her partner took the project into their own hands and they laid the deck together, furnishing it with budget items from Kmart and The Reject Shop.

In total, Amie said she and her partner saved 'at least $5,000' by doing it themselves, and she wouldn't change it for the world.

'Our backyard makeover!' Amie posted on Facebook, alongside photos of her deck before and afterwards.

'Amazing what you can do with a small block. A very boring space transformed into a lovely entertainment area.' 

To carry out the project, the Australian mum said she and her partner first bought all of the materials from Bunnings for around $3,500. 

Then, they dug up as much soil and grass around the base as possible to avoid any moisture sitting on the timber.

'We had a carpenter lay the foundation, which cost $4,000, and then my husband laid the deck so no labour cost,' Amie wrote.

'It took him about 20 hours across two weeks after work and was a bit of a backbreaking job.'

She added: 'But it was worth it, as all our quotes were around $11,500-$12,000 - so we saved about $5,000.'

Once the decking was done, it was just about decoration.

For this, Amie said she bought some wall pallets from The Reject Shop to decorate the area, as well as some fairy lights from the discount store.

She added furniture and plants from Bunnings and Kmart, and said their family love spending time in their new outdoor area now.

AFTER: 'This looks amazing and I'm definitely saving it as inspo for our new build,' one homeowner posted of the transformation (pictured after)

Thousands who saw the budget outdoor transformation on Facebook said they loved it and would love to try something similar.

'This looks amazing and I'm definitely saving it as inspo for our new build,' one homeowner posted.

'Wow, what a cracker job, you should be proud,' another added.

Others said they had been inspired to transform their own home's outdoor area after seeing Amie's home.
