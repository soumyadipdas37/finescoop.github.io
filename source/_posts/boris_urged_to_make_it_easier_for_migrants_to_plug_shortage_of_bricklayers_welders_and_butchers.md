Boris Johnson was urged to make it easier for migrant workers to enter Britain to become builders and even butchers today - as he launched a scheme to provide new skills for Brits left unemployed by coronavirus.

The independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) recommended that meatsellers, bricklayers and welders be added to the UK's shortage occupation list (SOL) - which helps migrants get work visas to fill jobs where there are not enough native applications.

They were suggested along with care workers by the MAC to 'relieve pressure when freedom of movements ends' in December.

Jobs on the SOL are  'subject to different, more favourable, migration arrangements, enabling employers to access a wider pool of suitable workers, more quickly'. 

Other jobs also recommended for the UK-wide shortage list include: archaeologists, cyber security specialists, vets, pharmacists, nurses, paramedics, secondary school teachers for certain subjects, architects, social workers, artists, some classical dancers and musicians, meat hygiene inspectors, electricians, mechanics and fishermen. 

But the announcement this morning came as Mr Johnson was in Exeter trying to launch his own scheme amid plummeting ratings of his handling of the coronavirus crisis.

The PM offered digital boot camps and free college courses as part of a £2.5billion scheme guaranteeing retraining to anyone without A-Levels or equivalent qualifications.

Professor Brian Bell, the MAC chairman, admitted it was 'extraordinary' to see butchers on the list but said it was a reflection on the attitude of 'governments of all persuasions for decades now'

Here are the Shortage Occupation Lists recommended by the Migration Advisory Committee for the UK, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Health professionals are the only role listed on the Welsh list.

The UK-wide Shortage Occupation List includes:

The list for Scotland includes:

The list for Northern Ireland includes:

There are fears millions of Britons could lose their jobs due to the impact of Covid-19 on the economy and the limited nature of rescue measures outlined by Chancellor Rishi Sunak. 

Professor Brian Bell, the MAC chairman, admitted it was 'extraordinary' to see butchers on the list but said it was a reflection on the attitude of 'governments of all persuasions for decades now'.

'I don't think we've done a very good job of linking where we see shortages with a training and education programme that actually thinks about addressing these shortages,' he said.

'As far as we are aware, we are the only advisers to government that actually produce essentially a list of where we think there are shortages in particular occupations.

'Perhaps other parts of government do but I'm not aware of it.

'Of course what we're doing it for is the immigration system.

'We're not doing it to advise the Department for Education about what sort of training programmes might be needed in the future.

'And there is a gap there I think that other countries do better at linking this kind of forward looking aspect of where are the shortages, what should we be doing about it.'

Prof Bell also said those industries need to do more to attract resident workers, adding: 'If we continue to see occupations saying 'oh we will just rely on immigration' then the likelihood is that the community will become progressively less sympathetic to their case.

'There is clear potential for a better future in terms of training programmes to make sure British workers can fill those jobs in the future.' 

Mr Johnson today said the UK had fallen behind other countries in technical skills, partly due to 'snooty' attitudes to vocational qualifications.

And in a snipe seemingly aimed at his own backbenchers he said the UK had also been 'hamstrung' by a lack of investment in infrastructure and 'antiquated' planning rules.

Addressing students at Exeter College in Devon, the Prime Minister said: 'The British economy is in the process of huge and rapid change, driven by the internet and the possibilities of remote communication.

'But as old types of employment fall away, opportunities are opening up with dizzying speed - vast new sectors in which this country already leads or can lead the world.'

His speech today came after Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his latest package to prop up jobs, but confirmed that the massive furlough bailout will end next month - despite fears the numbers on the dole queue will soar.

Mr Johnson vowed to help those people find new roles as the economy reels from the impact of the pandemic.

From April, adults without an A-Level or equivalent qualification will be offered a free, fully-funded college course - providing them with skills valued by employers, and the opportunity to study at a time and location that suits them.

Higher education loans will also be made more flexible, allowing adults and young people to space out their study across their lifetimes, take more high quality vocational courses in further education colleges and universities, and to support people to retrain for jobs of the future.

The Prime Minister suggested that some jobs in traditional shops, pubs or restaurants may be gone for good, saying coronavirus 'has compressed that revolution' in areas like online shopping.

'Let's imagine that you are 30 years old, you left school without A-levels and you are thinking - you were in retail or hospitality - you could find a job in the wind farm sector in the North East, or in space technology in Newquay or in construction here in Exeter,' he added.

Boris Johnson bemoaned a lack of British-educated coronavirus lab technicians today.

Addressing students in Exeter he said that over the last few months he had been to many labs where experts, 'many of them young, are working flat out on testing samples – testing for the disease, testing for the efficacy of potential vaccines, testing the tests'.

He said ti was hard work which required a high level of skill and experience, but added: 'Every time I have been fascinated to find that a sizeable proportion of the technicians are from overseas.

'And though I welcome that, because it is one of the glories of our education system that it attracts so many people from around the world, we have to face the fact – that at this moment when we need them so much, there is a shortage of UK-trained lab technicians, just as there is a shortage of so many crucial skills.

'Workers, and skilled mechanics, and skilled engineers, and we are short of hundreds of thousands of IT experts.

'And it is not as though the market does not require these skills. The market will pay richly.

The problem is one of supply – and somehow our post-18 educational system is not working in such a way as to endow people with those skills.'
