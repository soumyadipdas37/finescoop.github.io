A lucky driver managed to escape a crash unharmed after his truck overturned because it could not withstand the weight of its top heavy trailer.

A man was driving his truck across a busy bypass in Irving, Texas, on September 17 when his trailer flipped over and sent the vehicle crashing into a road barrier.

The car was travelling in the right-hand lane of the bypass in Dallas-Fort Worth as other vehicles overtook it on its left, dashcam footage shows. 

In the video, the truck begins to turn the corner but the top heavy trailer sways unsteadily as the small car struggles to hold the weight of the large attachment.

Dashcam video footage shows the trailer, which has a Hummer strapped securely on top, topples over as the truck attempts to veer around a corner

The truck topples over when it veers around the corner as it is not able to withstand the weight of the long trailer, which has a Hummer securely strapped on top.

The truck smashes into the safety barrier on the bypass after skidding along the road on its side, the footage shows.

Another car, which had been driving alongside the truck before the crash, narrowly avoided the crash after managing to overtake the vehicle just before it lost control.

The driver of the truck also had a lucky escape as the safety barrier prevented his vehicle from toppling over the side of the bypass, instead pushing the overturned car back into the middle of the road. 

The driver who recorded the dashcam footage said that the man who was driving the truck had somehow managed to escape unharmed.

He added: 'My commute home in DFW on my dashcam.

'The trailer was way too top-heavy with a hummer on the top and the driver took the bypass going to fast One gentleman in the truck was perfectly fine.'

The footage of the crash has been shared on YouTube and viewed more than 40,000 times by shocked individuals.

One person said: 'Wow that could have ended a lot worse if he made it over that retaining wall.'

Another commented: 'Damn hope he had insurance and walked away from that!'

Other users commended the truck driver on effectively strapping down the vehicle on top of the trailer, which managed to stay securely attached throughout the crash.

Rollovers can be caused by a truck changing direction too sharply or turning a corner too quickly.
