Details of the domestic violence restraining order filed against Tamar Braxton are coming to light.

The Love And War singer's ex-boyfriend, David Adefeso, alleges Braxton attacked him while he was driving his car, and that she threatened to have him killed.

He added that she unexpectedly started punching in the jugular, which caused him to become disoriented while behind the wheel on his Rolls-Royce, according to documents obtained by TMZ.

Adefeso, 49, went on to claim that Braxton began to trash the car when he pulled over and parked the vehicle, damaging the camera and rearview mirror, and that he suffered bruising to his neck and shoulder area.

After the incident in question, the businessman said Braxton confessed that her ex-husband wanted to 'send goons' to kill him six months ago, but she stopped it from happening.

According to those same same court documents, he says she has since threatened to let those 'goons' loose on him. Adefeso subsequently filed for the temporary restraining order in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 

The following day Adefeso addressed his request for a restraining order, and some of the tumultuous events that led to his split with Braxton, on YouTube Live, as reported by ET.

He first made a point to talk about the seriousness of mental health concerns in America and how society needs to take away the 'stigma' behind it.

'It's important that we continue to stand by and support people who have mental health [issues],' he urged viewers, before making it clear that he had no intention of 'speaking out ill against someone who I love so much.'

After professing his love and support to Braxton, Adefeso stated that he had 'been a victim of domestic violence; domestic assault' in video statement

After professing his love and support to his ex-girlfriend, Adefeso stated that he had 'been a victim of domestic violence; domestic assault.' 

Braxton, herself, has yet to address the accusations, but a source has told The Blast that it was Adefeso who was the aggressor during the altercation, something Adefeso adamantly denied during his statement.

'I will never never bring myself to attack Tamar, somebody I spent so long with. I never will. It's just not something I would do. I will speak the truth,' he said of the allegations levied against him.

'I have never, ever, ever; I never will, ever put my hand on a woman, ever. I grew up in a household; my parents were together for 50 years and my mom and dad were the most loving and kind couple to each other. I didn't grow up in that environment, the Nigerian native revealed with obvious emotion.

'I never, ever put my hands on Tamar Braxton or any women in my entire life.'

Just this past August, Braxton credited Adefeso with 'saving her life' after she allegedly tried to commit suicide in an emotional Instagram post. He found her unresponsive at a Downtown LA hotel in an alleged suicide attempt in July.

The singer was transported to a hospital and later was moved to another facility that specialized in mental health treatments.

After her hospitalization, David spoke out publicly about her condition, and how she had been struggling with depression. 

'Please continue to send prayers and hope as Tamar continues the path to recovery and ultimate happiness.,' he told The Blast. 

Adefeso has appeared with the R&B singer's reality TV show, Braxton Family Values, which aired from 2011 until 2019.
