She's currently making the most of summer by holidaying with her roommate and former Love Island co-star Arabella Chi.

And Harley Brash mixed business with pleasure as she took part in a sun-soaked photoshoot with ISAWITFIRST.COM at O Beach in Ibiza on Tuesday.

The reality star, 21, turned up the heat as she slipped into an animal print swimsuit while showcasing her best poses.

Highlighting her enviable figure, the former estate agent stunned in the patterned one-piece, which featured cut-out detailing across its bodice.

The TV star opted for comfort when it came to her footwear as she ditched her signature heels in favour of going barefoot and flashed her sleek white pedicure in the process.

Proving less is more, the Geordie beauty accessorised with just a pair of dainty earrings and a gold necklace.

Straight, glossy tresses framed her stunning features, which were accentuated with neutral-toned make-up.

The holidaymaker will face 14 days of quarantine when she returns to the UK after the government pulled its air bridge with Spain following a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Harley rose to fame on last year's Love Island, when she was partnered up with Chris Taylor and later became the first couple to split after leaving the villa.

The media personality revealed details about her single life during an interview with FUBAR Radio.

She said: 'I’m happy being single at the moment. I’m just enjoying myself. I’m having fun. I don’t kiss and tell but it is nice.' 

The blonde bombshell also blamed their 'busy schedules' for pulling them apart from each other. 

She confessed: 'We were just better off as friends…we had such busy schedules and we both realised that it was better to break it off now and we could still be friends.

The former couple's relationship appeared to be on the rocks when fans noticed they were sat apart from one another at the Love Island final.
