Opting for a minimalistic aesthetic, Lea showed off the tranquil looking white room with hints of wood accents sprinkled about. 

Undoubtedly a very peaceful space for both mother and baby, Lea decorated the room with a basket of cozy blankets and pillows and photograph of a horse. 

She chose a cherry wood crib for her baby and a grey and white color palette to compliment the chic yet understated room tone. 

Michele also showed her followers a few of the baby books she has started to accumulate, most notably Each Peach Pear Plum, a classic picture book from 1978.

Blessing: Lea also shared a sweet snap of her son's foot resting on a muslin blanket

The actress - who has called motherhood a 'true blessing' - followed up with another peek at baby Ever, sharing a snap of the tot's foot resting on a muslin blanket. 

Lea and her husband Zandy, 36, were first linked in 2017 before the pair got engaged a year later and married in March 2019. The pair were friends for a couple years before things turned romantic and their whirlwind romance kicked off. 

A close source told People magazine that friends of Lea were 'thrilled that she's found happiness' with Zandy after going through a lot before the pair linked up.

The notoriously private couple first announced their pregnancy news after Lea posted a photo to Instagram in April.

Amid all her pregnancy joy, Lea experienced the heartbreaking loss of fellow Glee cast member Naya Rivera after the actress was reported missing following a lake trip with her son on July eighth. 

The following week on July 13, the 33-year-old's body was found seven years to the day that Lea's ex and fellow Glee cast member Cory Monteith tragically overdosed in Vancouver on heroin and alcohol in 2013.

Lea took to social media to mourn the loss of both cast members as the whole Glee family rallied around each other to support Naya Rivera and her family after her body was found in Lake Piru, CA after she tragically drowned in the lake in a 'matter of minutes.'

Despite the tragedies that ensued this summer Lea has been trying to lay low with her husband and their new baby as she has felt incredibly grateful for her precious little family at this time. 

Lea Michele first rose to fame on Glee as Rachel Berry in 2009. 

The Broadway actress turned TV star got her start in the performing world in productions like Les Misérables and Spring Awakening.
