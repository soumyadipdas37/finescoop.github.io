Stacey Solomon cut a casual figure as she and husband Joe Swash went grocery shopping on Monday.

The couple took their brand new Volkswagen T6 camper van with them after Joe, 38, purchased it as a surprise to his girlfriend and their family.

Stacey, 30, opted for a laid back look for the outing, donning a baby blue jumper with a 'Smile' print and matching tracksuit bottoms.

The Loose Women presenter also sported a pair of white trainers while she styled her brunette locks into an updo.

Stacey put safety first for the outing as she wore a face mask while taking her shopping to the van.

Joe also opted for a casual look, wearing a grey jumper with black skinny jeans and a matching cap. 

It comes after the former EastEnders star purchased the pristine white van as a surprise for his girlfriend Stacey which she dubbed a 'monstrosity' on Saturday.

Joe captioned the snap: 'Welcome to the family. Southlands Motor Company you guys did an amazing job thanks.' 

The doting father-of-two revealed on his Instagram on Friday that he was heading 'up north' to collect 'something very exciting', according to The Mirror. 

Joe, who shares one-year-old son Rex with Stacey, described how he couldn't 'wait to make some memories' as he showed his followers the 'new addition' to the Swash/Solomon family.    

However Loose Women panellist Stacey was not exactly impressed with the van, which can retail at around £45,000, as she described as a 'monstrosity'.

Speaking on her Instagram stories, she zoomed in on the motor from the upstairs window and said: 'Oh my God - what the hell Joe?' 

Joe, who is dad to son Harry, 13, from a previous relationship, added: 'Our new home on wheels mate - our new home do you like it?' 

The mother-of-three playfully pushed a beaming Joe onto the bed adding: 'When did you get that?' 

Stacey captioned her post with a laughing face emoji and penned: 'When he gets something in his head...

'Is he actually joking... I was so tired last night I walked passed that monstrosity thinking someone had parked up and gone to the pub or something only to find out it's ours apparently.' 

Yet Stacey, who is also mum to sons Zachary, 12, and Leighton, eight, later shared a heartwarming picture of her three boys and Joe in the back of the camper van. 

She penned: 'Those faces though... I knew once he'd got this idea into his head it was inevitable...

Happy: Joe captioned the snap: 'Welcome to the family. Southlands Motor Company you guys did an amazing job thanks'

'I didn't realise how soon though. Usually it takes him a week just to text me back so I thought it'd have years before he made this happen. 

'I am excited for him and the boys and our adventures. I love them so much and making memories with them is my favourite thing in the world. So here we go. 

'First memory they will have is the school run. Bye bye normal car hello camper.' 

The VW camper boats plush leather seats and vibrant blue LED lighting across the top of the window along with a mini oven and fridge.
