Brandi Glanville has claimed that she got supportive messages from Heather Locklear amid her feud with Denise Richards.

However she alleged that Heather is unwilling to discuss the actress on TV because Denise purportedly once sent her a cease and desist.

Appearing on Wednesday night's episode of Watch What Happens Live, Brandi, 47, told her story to Real Housewives producer Andy Cohen.

Although Brandi's interview aired Wednesday hours after Denise's rep told Variety she was quitting the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, it was taped the day before. 

The current Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills season has been roiled by drama involving Brandi's claim that Denise had an extramarital affair with her last April.

Denise celebrated her second wedding anniversary with Aaron Phypers this week and has consistently denied that the affair with Brandi ever took place.

'So Heather just reached out to me and said: "Thank you," with a bunch of hearts and prayers. And I was like, it just made me feel like I was probably bringing this side of Denise out for everyone to see. And I wrote back: "Of course. The truth always comes out." And she wrote a bunch of more hearts,' Brandi told Andy.

Allegations: Brandi claimed Heather declined to discuss the matter on Watch What Happens Live because she 'had a cease and desist from Denise....'; Heather is pictured in 2013

Her side: Denise's departure from RHOBH went public hours before part two of the three-part season 10 reunion aired where she said Brandi was 'not a friend of mine'

'And then I said: "Hey, you should be on Watch What Happens Live with me," and she said: "I've already had a cease and desist from Denise so I'm not gonna do it."'

Denise reportedly sent a cease and desist to Bravo to get the network to stop broadcasting material about Brandi's affair allegation.

She is also claimed to have sent similar cease and desists to co-stars as well as to Evolution, the production company behind the show, Page SIx reports. 

Months ago Brandi also wrote on Instagram that Denise 'sent me a cease-and-desist [so] I will not talk about her.'

Heather and Denise used to be close pals but their friendship broke apart in the late 2000s as their respective marriages collapsed.

Denise divorced Heather's former Spin City co-star Charlie Sheen in 2006. In the months following her filing Denise took up with Bon Jovi's Richie Sambora.

Richie used to be married to Heather, who filed in February 2006 for a divorce that was ultimately finalized in April 2007.

There was speculation that Denise tore Richie away from her friend but she denied this version of events to Redbook in 2008.

'I was no longer friends with Heather months before Richie and I got together. I don't want to say what caused the split, but she and I weren't even speaking then' she said.

'It wasn't ever like we'd be shopping and go back to her house and I'd flirt with her husband. Yes, I got together with Heather's soon-to-be ex-husband, but no, I didn't have an affair with him. If Heather and I had been friends at that time, I would never have crossed that line. But we weren't,' Denise insisted.

'The friendship was not salvageable, and in the beginning Richie and I just talked as friends because we were dealing with similar situations. We never planned for anything to happen,' she said. 

'Did I question the decision? Yes. Did I know it wouldn't go over well? Of course. I'm a grown woman and I know what I did and the repercussions of it. I get why the public thinks I'm an awful person who stole someone's husband,' Denise confessed.

Acting: Heather and Denise even shared an on-screen kiss on Spin City

'But in my heart, I know I did not break up their marriage. If either Richie or I had felt our marriages were fixable, we wouldn't have crossed that line.'

Denise's departure announcement from The Real Housewives OF Beverly Hills came the day that the second part of the three-part pre-taped season 10 reunion aired.

'The word of the night is calculated #timing #Are you f***ing kidding me,' Brandi tweeted Wednesday night.

Denise said on Wednesday's reunion episode that Brandi was 'not a friend of mine,' but on that night's episode of Watch What Happens Live Brandi said: 'We were definitely friends and more than friends actually.' 

'Calculated #timing': Not only are the Real Housewives reunion episodes pre-taped, but apparently Brandi's Watch What Happens Live shot was filmed a day before its air-date as well

Ciao: Beverly Hills Housewife Erika Jayne, whom Denise has clashed with on the show, appeared to take an online dig at her after her exit made headlines

Beverly Hills Housewife Erika Jayne, whom Denise has clashed with on the show, appeared to take an online dig at her after her exit made headlines.

Erika tweeted a Small Wonder GIF of a door slam along with the word: 'Bye' and a waving hand emoji. 

Denise became a Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills in 2018 just three years after Brandi left the reality series after three seasons in the main cast. 

On the current season, at a group dinner in Rome, Denise blew up at her fellow Housewives whom she felt had relentlessly 'interrogated' her about Brandi's claim.

The meal deteriorated into a massive row where Denise slammed her co-stars as 'mean girls' and fled the table before a producer convinced her to come back.

This February she responded to an Instagram comment claiming she had an 'open marriage' and insisted that she is '100% monogamous to my husband.'

Last year the onetime Bond girl revealed that both she and Aaron got happy ending massages at her suggestion during their romance.

'If I was just doing it to make a splash, why would I not have done it last season? Then they would have brought me back full-time this season because they would have had a giant full f**king story line,' Brandi said in July of her allegations. 

She asserted to Us Weekly: 'I didn’t say it last season because I was worried that I was a cheater after she’s like: "Oh, Aaron’s going to kill me if he finds out." I thought: "What is she talking about?" That is bulls***."'

The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills rose to be the 'top-rated cable program on Wednesday nights' amid this storyline, according to Variety.
