A Christian school assistant who was sacked for posting on Facebook about plans to teach LGBT relationships in primary schools is taking her case to an employment tribunal. 

Kristie Higgs, 44, was dismissed for gross misconduct by Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, last year. 

Mrs Higgs claims senior staff compared her views to those of 'Nazi rightwing extremists' after they saw a screenshot of a private Facebook post, The Times reported. 

The case begins at the Bristol employment tribunal today, where Mrs Higgs is seeking £56,000.  

Kristie Higgs, 44, was dismissed for gross misconduct by Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, last year 

The mother-of-two shared and commented on Facebook posts which raised concerns about relationship education at her son's Church of England primary school. 

Mrs Higgs, who was posting on Facebook, under her maiden name, shared two posts in October 2018. 

In one, she urged people to sign an online petition against making relationships education mandatory. 

In the other, she shared an article from JudyBeth, an American conservative Christian commentator, about the rise of 'transgender ideology' in children's books in American schools.

Next to the article, she wrote: 'This is happening in our Primary Schools now!'  

The Christian Legal Centre is supporting Mrs Higgs's case at the employment tribunal, which begins today. 

She is seeking £56,000, although the figure could go down because she has since found work. 

Lawyers representing Mrs Higgs, who worked at the school as a pastoral worker and administrator for seven years, will argue that her sacking breached her freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

Ahead of the hearing, Mrs Higgs said: 'Nothing could have prepared me for what happened. 

In one of the two Facebook posts, she shared an article from JudyBeth, an American conservative Christian commentator

'I was told that the reasons behind my sacking were nothing to do with my Christian beliefs - it had everything to do with my Christian beliefs. 

'The whole experience broke my heart. I have been punished for sharing concerns about relationships and sex education. 

'My number one concern has always been the effect that learning about sex and gender in school will have on children at such a young age. I have not discriminated against anyone. 

'Through my case I want there to be renewed freedom for others, especially Christians, to express their beliefs and opinions without fear of losing their jobs.'

A spokesperson for Farmor's School said: 'As this matter is subject to ongoing tribunal proceedings it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage.'
