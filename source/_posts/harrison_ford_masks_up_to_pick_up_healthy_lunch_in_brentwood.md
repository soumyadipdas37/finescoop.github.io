Oscar nominee Harrison Ford picked up take-out from organic salad restaurant sweetgreen inside the Brentwood Gardens Plaza in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

The 78-year-old Hollywood silver fox made sure to protect himself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a black mask, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for public outings on June 18.

As of Wednesday, there have been over 262K confirmed coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 6,401 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University.

Harrison sported a grey T-shirt, blue jeans, and black boots for his healthy lunch outing.

Ford's street sighting came the morning after the 54th birthday festivities of his eldest son Ben from his 15-year marriage to first wife Mary Marquardt, which ended in 1979.

The Call of the Wild actor and Mary are also parents of son Willard, 51; and he has two children - daughter Georgia, 30; and son Malcolm, 32 - from his second marriage to the late Melissa Mathison.

Harrison and his third wife Calista Flockhart are officially empty nesters now that their 19-year-old son Liam is attending Amherst College in Massachusetts.

The married couple of a decade originally met at the 2002 Golden Globe Awards.

The 55-year-old Ally McBeal alum might get a chance to reprise her White House Press Secretary character Cat Grant in the sixth and final season of The CW's Supergirl, which premieres midseason next year.
