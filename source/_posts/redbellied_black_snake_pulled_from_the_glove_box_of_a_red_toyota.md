A red-bellied black snake has been pulled from the glove box of a red Toyota after a woman spotted the venomous reptile while driving.

The woman was behind the wheel in Lowood, about 60 kilometres west of Brisbane, when she noticed the snake on Monday.

She pulled over in front of a chemist and called Andrew's Snake Removal to remove the metre-long creature from the car.

'The lady driving obviously got a hell of a fright as she saw it coming out while driving,' Andrew's Snake Removal wrote on Facebook, alongside a video of the removal.

'I opened up the glove box and there it was sitting nice and content.'

The snake catcher grabbed the serpent by his tail and begun to pull his body through a gap at the top of the glove box.

'He was sitting right in your glove box,' the snake catcher told the woman.

He then softly jiggled the snake's belly to free him from the car.  

'C'mon buddy,' he said before the snake fell through the gap. 

Andrew's Snake Removal said it had been a 'busy day' but he was glad to have freed the snake swiftly.

'Its usually a nightmare to find a snake when its got in to a car but luckily found this guy pretty quickly,' the Facebook post read.
