Barcelona star Lionel Messi has endured a turbulent summer after asking for a move and then performing a dramatic U-turn when it became clear he couldn't leave on a free transfer.

And the 33-year-old Argentine was less than impressed with the unwanted attention he received from Gimnastic de Tarragona midfielder Javier Ribelles on his return to action in a pre-season friendly on Saturday.

The six-time Ballon d'Or winner didn't get on the scoresheet in Barcelona's 3-1 victory, but he did deliver an x-rated rant.

Goal.com reported that according to Gimnastic midfielder Javier Ribelles, Messi called him an 'a**hole' for fouling him during the match.

'What are you doing, idiot? Do you want to stop kicking me, a**hole?' Messi said, according to Ribelles. 

In an attempt to defuse the row, the Gimnastic player replied to Leo's x-rated rant by saying: 'It's that if you're the best I have to kick you, I can't let you turn because you're going to beat me.'

Messi made his return for Barcelona for the first time since his dramatic transfer U-turn by playing 45 minutes of the Catalan club's pre-season friendly win over Gimnastic de Tarragona. 

The 33-year-old was named in the starting line-up by new manager Ronald Koeman as goals from Ousmane Dembele, Antoine Griezmann and Phillipe Coutinho secured the victory as they get set to embark on another season.
