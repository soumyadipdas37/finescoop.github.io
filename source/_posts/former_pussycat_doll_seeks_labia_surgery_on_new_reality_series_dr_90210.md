Former Pussycat Doll Jessi Peralta is seeking surgery to repair her torn labia on Monday night's premiere of Dr. 90210, E!'s new reality series that follows four female doctors in Beverly Hills.  

In a preview clip from the episode, the 38-year-old So You Think You Can Dance alum has a consultation with Dr. Cat Begovic, who proves to be more sympathetic than the male doctor she had previously met with. 

'I had some tearing on my labia,' she says of the injury, which she suffered when she gave birth to her daughter in 2016. 'They tried to sew it up. I could feel the thread being pulled through the skin, but because I didn’t have any pain medication I pretty much wimped out.'

Going under the knife: Jessi Peralta, 38, consults with Dr. Cat Begovic about labia surgery on Monday's night's premiere of the E! reality series Dr. 90210

Hard to handle: In a preview clip from the episode, Peralta explains that she experienced 'some tearing' on her labia when she gave birth to her daughter in 2016

Dr. Begovic assures her that she didn't 'wimp out,' noting that not too many people can handle the pain of having 'sutures in that area' without any numbing medication.  

'As a woman, you want to feel sexy and it’s just made me very self-conscious,' Peralta admits to the plastic surgeon. 

In her testimonial, the mom further explains her reasons for wanting the surgery, saying it has to with more than just function.  

'Let’s say a hook ripped your cheek in half. Could you still eat? Yeah, I can chew on the other side of my mouth. Can you still smile? Yeah, but it looks really crazy,' she says. 'Everything functions well, but it just looks a little crazy. So, if you can have it fixed, why not?'

Feeling shy: The former Pussycat Doll, pictured in 2010, admits the appearance of her labia has negatively affected her sex life with her husband because she's now self-conscious

Peralta says the appearance of her labia has also negatively affected her sex life with her husband because she is now more self-conscious that she had ever been before.

'Prior to the injury, I was much much more free sexually with my husband. Ever since, I am not confident enough to allow the access that he wants,' she says, laughing. 'Access has been denied.' 

Peralta admits that she had previously looked into getting surgery to repair the damage, but the doctor minimized her concerns. 

'I did have an experience with a male OB/GYN who told me, "Oh why would you do that? It’s not worth it. You just look like any ol' woman that’s had a baby, and who cares?" And it’s like, I care and that’s enough of a reason,' she tells Dr. Begovic, who readily agrees. 

Candid: 'Prior to the injury, I was much much more free sexually with my husband. Ever since, I am not confident enough to allow the access that he wants,' she tells the plastic surgeon 

'Exactly, and I’m so glad that you didn’t let that discourage you or make you feel bad in any way. You caring is enough,' the doctor assures her.

'See, you understand because you’re another woman,' Peralta notes. 

In her testimonial, the mom points out that a man would never wait to get something like this done if they were suffering. 

'If a man were to experience some crazy penile experience, I’m sure he would have that fixed immediately. So why can’t women feel that same sense of urgency?' she asks. 

Prerogative: The mom says a male doctor of hers dismissed her interest in surgery, saying: 'Oh why would you do that? It’s not worth it. You just look like any ol' woman that’s had a baby'

Just saying: In her testimonial, Peralta points out that a man would never wait to fix 'some crazy penile experience' 

At the end of the clip, Peralta admits to Dr. Begovic that she is a big fan of hers. 

'I found you on Snapchat,' she says. 'I was just so inspired by you and just found it fascinating to watch you do surgeries.'

Peralta says she was also drawn to the doctor because of her admittedly perfectionist tendencies.    

'Really, like 100 per cent of my effort is focused on having it look as perfect as possible,' Dr. Begovic says of her work as a plastic surgeon.
