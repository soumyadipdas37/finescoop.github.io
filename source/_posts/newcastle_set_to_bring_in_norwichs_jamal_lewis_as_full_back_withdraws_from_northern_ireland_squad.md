Jamal Lewis has withdrawn from the Northern Ireland squad to complete a £15million move to Newcastle United.

The Norwich full-back was due to be in line to face Norway in the Nations League on Monday evening but will instead finalise proceedings at St James' Park, according to Sky Sports.

The 22-year-old defender is set to be the Magpies' third summer signing of the week after Steve Bruce brought in Bournemouth duo Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser.

Striker Wilson joined in a £20million transfer from the Cherries while attacking midfielder Fraser moved on a free transfer after his Bournemouth contract expired on June 30. 

The 22-year-old saw a move to Liverpool fall through earlier this summer and had interest from Crystal Palace and Leicester after an impressive season in the top-flight with Norwich last term. 

Lewis played 28 times for Daniel Farke's side but couldn't stop his team from suffering relegation straight back to the Championship.

The defender came through the youth academy in East Anglia after joining from Luton in 2014 and made 100 appearances in all competitions for Norwich since then. 

Lewis played 90 minutes for Northern Ireland in Friday night's 1-1 draw with Romania but will not feature at all for the Norway clash. 

The match on Friday was Lewis' 18th international cap of his career, having made his Northern Ireland debut in 2018. 

Lewis could make his Newcastle debut on Saturday when his new side travel to West Ham for a 3pm kick-off.
