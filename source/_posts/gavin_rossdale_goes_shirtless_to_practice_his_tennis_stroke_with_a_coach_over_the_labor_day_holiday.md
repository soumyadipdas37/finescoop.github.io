While some celebrities are taking to the beach or their boats to celebrate the Labor Day holiday, Gavin Rossdale is spending the day on the tennis court.

The 54-year-old Bush singer was spotted going shirtless while practicing his tennis stroke on a court in Malibu on Monday afternoon.

The frontman was practicing under the tutelage of the celebrity tennis coach known simply as Coach Patrick.

Rossdale made headlines last month when he was seen stepping out with a mystery blonde at an outdoor market in Malibu.

He was spotted with his arm around the young blonde at the Trancas Country Market in Malibu on Tuesday.

The singer was seen taking his beloved Pomeranian pooch Chewy for a walk as they strolled through the market.
