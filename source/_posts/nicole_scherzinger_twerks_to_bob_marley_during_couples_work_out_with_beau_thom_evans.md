They shared snaps and footage of themselves working out together on numerous occasions during lockdown.

And Nicole Scherzinger and her boyfriend Thom Evans made sure they were staying on top of their fitness game yet again with a couples workout in Malibu on Friday.

The Pussycat Dolls star, 42, showed off her incredible physique as she twerked to Bob Marley's classic song Could You Be Loved during the exercise session.

The singer donned blue patterned sports leggings and a matching sports bra as she larked around to the music.

Her beau, rugby player Thom, 35, showed off his muscles in a black vest and shorts as he coordinated his playful moves with Nicole.

Nicole put on a confident display during the workout video to the reggae tune which was posted to her Instagram Story.

Their work out session comes after they celebrated Labour Day weekend together with Simon Cowell's family in Malibu.

Nicole took to her Instagram earlier this week to share a series of videos and selfies with Simon's girlfriend Lauren Silverman and their son Eric.   

Posting a pair of loved-up snaps with her shirtless beau Thom, Nicole penned the caption: 'Happy #LaborDay weekend. Thank you to the essential workers for all your hard work, particularly in these challenging times.

'We are so grateful for you and celebrate you this weekend!'

They may have been dating for less than a year, but Nicole and Thom are clearly devoted to one another and divide their time between her LA pad and London. 

According to reports, Nicole is trying for a baby with her former rugby player beau.

The singer is said to be keen to start a family of her own with Thom, as the couple are looking to the future and intend on purchasing a property together in London.

A friend told The Sun: 'Thom told pals he's been taking supplements to boost fertility. Nicole and Thom are ridiculously loved-up, and have had serious conversations about everything from marriage to babies.

'No one would be surprised if they had some baby news in the coming months.

'Thom currently lives with his brother and a housemate in London which hardly makes for a romantic love nest. They are looking to buy a house together once lockdown is over.'

Nicole's representatives declined to comment and MailOnline also contacted Thom's representatives who are yet to comment.
