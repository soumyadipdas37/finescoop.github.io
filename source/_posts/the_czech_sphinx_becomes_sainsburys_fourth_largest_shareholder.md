A billionaire investor known as the 'Czech Sphinx' has become the fourth-largest shareholder in Sainsbury's.

Daniel Kretinsky, who is already the biggest shareholder in Royal Mail through his firm Vesa Equity, has built up a 3.05 per cent stake in the supermarket giant worth £130million.

The arrival of the 45-year-old on the share register will raise eyebrows in the City and in the Sainsbury's boardroom. 

Daniel Kretinsky, who is already the biggest shareholder in Royal Mail through his firm Vesa Equity, has built up a 3.05 per cent stake in Sainsbury's worth £130m

It is not known what Kretinsky's intentions are but the move sparked speculation that he would be pushing for change at the supermarket in order to boost its value. 

Sainsbury's shares rose 3.3 per cent, or 6.15p, to 191.15p as investors welcomed his arrival as a powerful shareholder.

The son of an informatics professor and a constitutional court judge, Kretinsky owns Sparta Prague football club. 

He made his money in energy, forging one of Europe's largest energy groups through more than a decade of deals, but has been diversifying and scouring retail, media and other areas for investments.

Shares in Sainsbury's are down nearly 17 per cent this year.
