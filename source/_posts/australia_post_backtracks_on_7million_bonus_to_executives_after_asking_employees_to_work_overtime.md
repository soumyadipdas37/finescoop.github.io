Australia Post has backtracked on rewarding $7million in bonus payments to executives after asking staff to volunteer to work overtime due to a massive backlog.

The agency's Victorian workforce was asked to 'urgently' help deliver packages thanks to a boom in deliveries, which saw parcel numbers up 186 per cent in the state in the third week of August during COVID-19 restrictions. 

This is thanks to increasing demand for online shopping, and limited staffing numbers at warehouses due to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. 

Despite the request, Australia Post's CEO Christine Holgate and senior executives were due to be handed bonuses totalling up to $7million - which has now been scrapped.

'Today the Australia Post board determined that no short-term incentive payment would be made to the executive team for financial year 2020,' chairman Lucio Di Bartolomeo said in a statement on Wednesday.

'I have every confidence in the executive team and their commitment to excellent performance in the year ahead.'

Ms Holgate, who receives an eye-watering $2.5million salary, making her the highest paid national civil servant, and senior executives took a 20 per cent pay cut in March due to the effects of COVID-19. 

She was estimated to receive $1million in bonuses. while executives could expect to receive $600,000 if the board decided to go ahead with pay rises.  

Australia Post recorded a $7.5billion revenue and a profit before tax of $53.6million in August.

Deliveries general manager Rod Barnes sent out an email to Victorian staff on Monday, including those in administration and finance, to beg for volunteers to help deliver parcels.

Workers would require a drivers licence, a car and be able to lift up to 16kg repeatedly to help with parcel pick-up services from facilities in Dandenong South, Bayswater and Brooklyn.

Facilities have been short-staffed due to social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic, creating a nationwide backlog.

'The work will involve minimal contact with others and you will be provided with personal protective equipment and training to ensure you are as safe and prepared to help your frontline teammates and our customers,' Mr Barnes wrote.

The agency had also already warned of delayed Father's Day parcels due to the backlog and reduced shift work in Melbourne (Pictured: people lining up at South Yarra post office on August 24)

An Australia Post spokesman confirmed that asking workers to work overtime to help deliver was normal.

'That's why – like we do in the lead up to Christmas each year – we have put the call out to our Melbourne office team members to help us with our record volumes if they can,' the spokesman said. 

'Our people who help out on the weekend will receive time in lieu. We will also reimburse our people for the use of their cars as per our usual mileage and expenses claim process.

'So far we've had around 200 of our Melbourne office based team members express interest to lend a hand to their front line colleagues to deliver for customers during one of our busiest periods ever, particularly in Victoria.'

Australia Post had previously requested from the government that deliveries be made every second day up until June 30 next year.

The agency had also already warned of delayed Father's Day parcels due to the backlog and reduced shift work in Melbourne.
