McDonald's will be chased for millions of dollars after a franchisee was found to be denying workers paid toilet and drink breaks.

A former worker at the fast food giant, Chiara Staines, won a landmark case in the Federal Court against Brisbane franchisee Tantex Holdings on Monday.

Ms Staines was denied ten minute paid breaks on all but three occasions while working at a McDonald's restaurant in Brisbane between May 8, 2017 to June 15, 2019.

Tantext Holdings was ordered to pay $1,000 in compensation to the former worker and all Australians McDonald's employees will now be legally entitled to paid water and toilet breaks.

The Retail and Fast Food Workers Union are now working to compensate hundreds of thousands of other workers who claim they weren't allowed breaks.

'At the moment we are concerned with the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of workers who may be interested in compensation,' Union secretary Josh Cullinan said.

'I am yet to meet the mystical worker that gets all their ten-­minute paid breaks and I have spoken to thousands of McDonald's workers. 

'I think these workers are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, that's beyond doubt.'

In making his decision in the Federal Court on Monday, Justice John Logan said 'The right to access the toilet or a drink of water was, in my view, a workplace right'.

Justice Logan also said Tantex general manager Chris Crenicean had threatened McDonald's employees who lobbied for their entitled breaks.

'It was unconscionable … absolutely to deny workers an ability to use the toilet when required or to drink water as needed,' he said. 

'That is so, irrespective of whether they are children, although it is hardly edifying that the threat of such denial was made to a group which, on the evidence, necessar­ily must have included children.' 

Mr Cullinan said on top of the $1,000 in compensation, Ms Staines had been paid $800 by McDonald's for the time she was not paid.

Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Staines said it was 'just amazing' that her case would benefit other fast food workers across the country.   

'It's what we were hoping for, it's incredibly common for McDonald's and other fast food workers to not allow for breaks. So hopefully this will put an end to that,' she said.   

 Ms Staines said she was 'glad' her legal battle, which began almost two years ago, had finally come to an end. 

'It was such a relief, it really was. This whole thing has been going on since the end of 2018 and the beginning of court proceedings were early this year,' she said.

Reflecting on her time at McDonald's, the former worker said her bosses would often deny going to the toilet or make her wait. 

'If you were desperate, you could go (to the toilet) but usually they would make you wait until there were fewer customers,' she said. 

She has since quit her job at McDonald's and is now studying child care. 

Mr Cullinan said 'McDonald's workers have long been exploited'.  

'When the major McDonald's franchisee, Tantex, stole rest breaks from workers, they broke the law.' 

'Our actions finally returned their penalty rates in February but the theft of rest breaks are common across the McDonald's network. Until now, those employers have not been held to account.

'This is the first time that a Union, and workers, have successfully sued McDonald's in Australia but it will not be the last.'

With the backing of the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, Ms Staines brought a case against the franchisee Tantex Holdings earlier this year.  

McDonald's staff have been entitled to paid ten-minute drink breaks under McDonald's Australia Enterprise Agreement 2013, which was approved by the Fair Work Commission on July 24, 2013.   

According to the enterprise agreement, all employees are entitled to a 10-minute drink break when they work a shift between four to nine hours.

If they work more than nine hours, staff are entitled to two 10-minute breaks.

This is in addition to a meal break if working longer than five hours.  

Tantex's general manager Christopher Crenicean responded to a union campaign with a lengthy rant (pictured) in Facebook group for their fast food employees in January

Earlier this year, RAFFWU launched a campaign against Tantex, accusing the company of breaking the enterprise agreement by denying toilet breaks. 

Tantex's general manager Christopher Crenicean responded with a lengthy rant in Facebook group for their fast food employees to which Justice Logan deemed threatening.

'On your shift, this ten-minute break would be the only time you would ever be permitted to have a drink or go to the toilet. So I hope to God you don't get thirsty on your next shift because we just wouldn't be able to allow a drink. Fair is fair right?' Mr Crenicean wrote in January. 

'But as we go above and beyond for our people and we like to treat you guys much better than this, we allow ALL our employees regardless of shift length to have a drink of water as you require and go to the bathroom as you require.'

'Are we really such bad guys? It actually works better in our favour to follow this legislation and keep you all working non-stop,' he said to finish off the message.
