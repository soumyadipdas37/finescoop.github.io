You don't have to spend a lot of money to get the most from your hairdryer. 

In fact, according to Amazon shoppers, this basic hair dryer checks all the right boxes. So much so that it's amassed close to 4,000 reviews and a near-perfect score of 4.6 out of 5. 

Whether you're after a voluminous bouncy 'do' or you're seeking a super sleek finish, the TRESemme 5542DU 2200W Power Smooth and Shine Dryer does the hard work for you. Plus, it's now reduced to only £15 on Amazon, which makes it a beauty bargain.  

The TRESemme Power Smooth and Shine Dryer is impressive for fast drying and effortless styling - leaving hair with a high shine finish

The Amazon review section helps take the guesswork out of finding the best products for you. With 75 per cent of shoppers awarding the TRESemme Power Smooth and Shine Dryer a full-five star rating, it's a popular and recommended buy. 

Shoppers have raved about the £15 hairdryer calling it a 'powerful dryer that is so light to use'. It's not just the performance that has been commended but the results too. 

'The dryer is a belter, I live with frizz on the ends of my hair I used this, and the straightness was so shiny, and no frizz at all, just long lushes hair. Best dryer I've ever bought.' 

The Power Dryer 2200 features two heat and two-speed settings as well as a cool setting for finishing and setting your style.

It's super powerful (2200 watts) for strong airflow, meaning you can achieve a bouncy blow-dry in little to no time. The speedy blow-dry time has been a huge draw for many shoppers, not just saving them time but reducing damage as they use less heat on their hair.

'Where beforehand it would take me 20 minutes to dry my hair with my old hairdryer this takes just 3 MINUTES. I have checked this with a stopwatch multiple times.

It also doesn't leave you with frizzy, dried-out, been-attacked-with-a-leaf-blower hair. My hair feels smooth and soft, and the cool shot leaves you with a nice shine too. I'm over the moon with this hairdryer (and my scalp is pretty happy with it too!).'

Delighted shoppers have shared hundreds of five-star reviews online praising the £15 TRESemme Power Smooth and Shine Dryer

One satisfied reviewer noted that unlike professional-grade dryers that can sometimes be heavy, the TRESemme Power Smooth and Shine Dryer is pretty lightweight meaning you won't get a dead arm styling your hair. 

'Incredibly lightweight and surprisingly powerful! Whilst my hair is fine I do have a lot of it so takes ages to dry usually - not the case with this hairdryer! Dries my hair super quick and as it’s light, you don’t get that achey arm feeling. Definitely recommended.'

While it perhaps doesn't have some of the settings of more high-end dryers, this doesn't seem to be a problem with shoppers. Thanks to the constant stream of balancing ions to enhance conditioning of your hair and eliminate frizz, shoppers have reported shiny hair with a glossy finish.

One delighted shopper raved: ''I am honestly amazed by the difference this hairdryer makes. It cut my drying time in half, but more importantly, my hair is sleek, straight and frizz-free! I don't need to use straighteners anymore, and my hair feels softer than ever. Very happy with the results, and at this bargain price I would definitely recommend.'
