Argos became the butt of shoppers' joked after advertising a pair of curtains that 'look like cigarettes'.

The British retailer advertised its printed border eyelet curtains at a reduced price of £5.99.

The bottom third of the drapes is a mustard yellow colour, while the rest is an off-white shade. 

The way the eyelets are positioned causes the curtains to fall in waves which makes them look like 10 vertical cylinders - and people spied a likeness to a packet of 10 cigarettes.

The interior design item was previously listed as £15 but was available in the Argos clearance sale for a third of its original price. 

The image of the curtains, widely shared online, shows the floor-length drapes hanging from a silver pole - but several shoppers pointed out they bear a striking resemblance to a 10-pack of cigarettes.

Dozens took to social media to mock the design fail, which saw Argos trending on Twitter yesterday.

One tweeted: 'Argos have released these curtains that appear to look like Richmond Superkings.'

Another wrote: '£5.99 for a set of curtains that look like a packet of cigarettes from @Argos_Online.'

And another asked: 'Why have Argos made curtains looking like JPS Superkings,' followed by a series of crying emojis.

While one joked: 'Ten cigars would have been better.' 

The curtains are no longer listed for sale, however retailers can purchase the same design in shades of natural and grey.

The original description of the curtains on the Argos website read: 'Looking to liven up a room with bright and colourful curtains?

'We can help you there. These unlined 2-tone Dublin curtains are 100 per cent cotton and will give you lots of natural light and plenty of privacy.

'We love their eyelet design for its fast and fiddle-free fitting and should disaster strike you can pop them in the wash. Like your room a bit darker?

'These curtains are also available fully lined.'

According to a screenshot of the mustard curtains shared online, the curtains boasted an average four out of five stars out of 18 reviews.
