Whitney Port was seen with her husband Tim Rosenman and son Sonny in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

The family of three was dressed casually as they went out for coffee. Whitney and Tim wore masks but Sonny, aged three, did not.

This comes after the designer said on her latest With Whit podcast that she is holding off on getting pregnant again because she wants to feel more 'mentally stable.'

Family-of-three: Whitney Port was seen with her husband Tim Rosenman and son Sonny in Los Angeles on Tuesday

Looking every inch the doting parents, the pair's tot stood in between his mom and dad in a white shirt rainbows on the front and a bright smile. 

Port oozed a casual-cool vibe dressed in a backwards baseball cap, beige long sleeve, matching sneakers and a pair of grey sweatpants. 

Meanwhile, her husband sported a blue cap and charcoal grey shorts. 

After experiencing a devastating miscarriage last year, Port has been open about her conflicted feelings about trying to get pregnant again in a Tuesday interview.

'I know deep down I would like to have another baby. I want Sonny to have another sibling. I feel it would complete our family,' she began.

No mask: The family of three was dressed casually as they went out for coffee. Whitney and Tim wore masks but Sonny, aged three, did not 

She explained: 'Our family feels complete, but it doesn't feel fully to the extent complete, like the ultimate level of greatness, that I think our family could be.'  

 Port also admitted she has 'some work' to do on herself, before feeling 'ready to take on this next layer of responsibility.' 

While she talked about previously 'leaving it all up to fate' and 'going off' her birth control, Port has recently begun focusing on getting her 'emotions straight.'  

She confessed: 'I really don't feel in a mentally stable place to get pregnant right now.'

To prevent feeling 'anxiety-ridden' during her next pregnancy, she has been trying 'therapy, mediation and various self help things.' 

Rosenman agreed on wanting to expand their family, but only went Port felt ready.  

She then wishes she had 'just done it earlier,' before saying, 'Oh wait, we did and I miscarried.'  

Acknowledging the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, she noted, 'The thought of having a baby right now, terrifies me' because of hospital restrictions for pregnant women.
