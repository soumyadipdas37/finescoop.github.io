With the seventh season of Black-ish arriving sometime next year, series creator Kenya Barris is developing a third spin-off of the flagship series.

Barris is developing Old-ish, which will center on Laurence Fishburne as Earl a.k.a. Pops and Jennifer Lewis as Ruby, the parents of main character Andre Johhnson, played by Anthony Anderson, according to The Hollywood Reporter. 

If the spin-off is ordered to series, it will be the third to be spun off from Black-ish, following Grown-ish, following Zoey Johnson's (Yara Shahidi) in college, and Mixed-ish, a prequel series following a young Rainbow Johnson (Arica Himmel) growing up with a black mother (Tika Sumpter) and white father (Mark-Paul Gosselaar).

The Old-ish spin-off will follow Earl and Ruby as they give love another chance, several years after they split.

They both move into a home in a 'rapidly gentrifying' neighborhood of Los Angeles, as they meet characters who are both old and new to the neighborhood while trying to make their marriage work one more time.

Fishburne has recurred on Black-ish since the first season and appeared in 60 of the show's 141 episodes, while Lewis has been a series regular since Season 2.

Barris will write the pilot script and serve as an executive producer alongside Fishburne and Johnson, along with E. Brian Dobbins, with Lewis credited as a producer.

ABC Signature will produce the series alongside Barris' Khalabo Ink Society. and Fishburne and Helen Sugland's Cinema Gypsy.

Barris had a first-look deal with ABC, but he left the network for a lucrative pact with Netflix in 2018, where he created Black AF, which recently got a second-season renewal.

Still, Barris has 'remained friendly' with ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke, who picked up Grown-ish at ABC's cable network Freeform.

Grown-ish will debut its fourth season on Freeform in 2021, while Mixed-ish will be back for its second season on ABC sometime in the 2020-2021 TV season. 

Barris also pushed Disney execs to release the 2018 Black-ish episode Please, Baby, Please on Hulu last month, which was famously shelved and lead Barris to negotiate an early exit at ABC to pave the way for a three-year eight-figure deal at Netflix.

Despite his massive deal at Netflix (on top of his first-look film deal at 20th Century Fox), his contract allows him to be 'deeply involved' with Black-ish and all of its spin-offs, including writing the Old-ish pilot. 

Barris is also developing a documentary about Civil Rights attorney Ben Crump, along with a musical animated series called Entergalactic.

He is also in negotiations for a Juneteenth musical where he will team up with Pharrell Williams, though his sketch comedy show Astronomy Show was canceled after just one season.
