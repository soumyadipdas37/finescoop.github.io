She is known to show off fun dance moves on social media. 

But Britney Spears flexed her athletic ability as she walked on her hands in a video posted to Instagram on Thursday. 

The 38-year-old pop-star told her 26.4m followers that 'seeing the world upside down is waaaaay better.'

She donned a hot-pink tube top, black mini shorts and red Adidas sneakers as she flipped herself upside down. 

Her blonde hair was tied back into a ponytail and fell back over her head as she walked on the grassy area near lush trees. 

Walking about six-feet, Britney kept lifting and setting down her hands, keeping her legs straight above her body, before flipping back down. 

It's not clear where the Oops! I Did It Again hitmaker was for her sunset activity.

New way of walking: Her blonde hair was tied back into a ponytail and fell back over her head as she walked on the grassy area near lush trees. Walking about six-feet, Britney kept lifting and setting down her hands, keeping her legs straight above her body, before flipping back down.

On Wednesday, she posted a video asking followers if they are 'truly happy' that appeared to from her Los Angeles backyard. 

Britney has been at the center of a conservatorship battle that has heated up recently. 

She revealed in new court filings obtained by TMZ that she's done with live performances — at least for the time being.

She made the disclosure as her battle with her father Jamie Spears has intensified over her ongoing conservatorship.

Jamie has been at the helm of Britney's affairs for more than 10 years following her involuntary psychiatric hold in 2008.

In her documents, the singer objected to her father's attempts to bring back Andrew Wallet as a co-conservator, a job he held from 2008–2019.

But dad Jamie has hit back, claiming Britney's stated objections to Wallet's appointment are inaccurate and requesting a hearing to determine the facts in his own legal docs.

The pop star has recently been trying to unseal court documents so that the public could see them, and her lawyer expressed support for the #FreeBritney movement earlier this month.
