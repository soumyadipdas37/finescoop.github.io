While still in his 20s, he suffered the loss both of his father — broadcasting legend Sir David Frost, who succumbed to a heart aneurysm in 2013 — and his eldest brother Miles just two years later, aged only 31, to an undiagnosed heart condition.

But it is precisely that double hammer blow which has persuaded George Frost to decry what he describes as the 'ridiculous' handling of the coronavirus outbreak and, in particular, the new ban on meetings of more than six people.

'It's the biggest knee-jerk reaction — so much more than the symptoms have merited,' George tells me.

He points out that the Covid-19 death rate is extremely low —comparable, in fact, to the 12 people under the age of 35 who die each week from undetected heart problems. 

'Are we banning sport among that age group? Of course we aren't!' fumes George.

As founder of rum brand The Duppy Share, George says that, working in the hospitality industry, he constantly hears of those now despairing of the future, with more and more of them seeking help from the industry charity. 

'They are contacting it with terrible mental health problems. Whether they've been furloughed or not, they've lost their core reason to be — and for what? The Government-led reaction to this will be looked back on with shame and incredulity.'

George, 33, hopes to marry magician Katherine Mills before Christmas — but only if his older brother Wilf, who works in America, can make it home.

Wilf's return, adds George, would be the perfect Christmas present for his 'incredibly stoic' mother Lady Carina Frost, daughter of the 17th Duke of Norfolk.

'She's lost her son and her husband. It is utterly insane she can no longer have friends over.'

Kylie Minogue's branded £9 rosé at Tesco failed to tickle the tastebuds of Carol Decker, singer with the Aussie star's Eighties chart rivals, T'Pau. 

'Sadly and it gives me no pleasure to say it, this is undrinkable,' complains Decker, who urged Kylie to 'do a tasting' before inflicting her wines on sensitive palates. 

Wait until she samples Phillip Schofield's widely derided Waitrose red ...

Ousted from A Question Of Sport in the BBC's cull of the white and middle-aged, at least Phil Tufnell can get some more sleep. 

'I once appeared with Tuffers on Celebrity Apprentice and he looked so shocking at the 8.30am call that I asked what time he had gone to bed,' recalls former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie. 

'He said: 'About 45 minutes ago.' ' Kelvin suggests Tufnell and the axed Sue Barker paid the price for being 'too old, too loyal'.

The businesswoman, who built a successful career while raising nine children with her husband, was inducted yesterday into the House of Lords.

Sharing a picture from Westminster of herself in full regalia, she tells me: 'It was really hot — ironically it was the first 'Covid-safe' ceremony involving robes. But worth overheating for.'

The 54-year-old said: 'I intend to use the platform for good — and of course that includes further work towards gender equality.'

It's a jungle in there! 

Former Pirelli model Christina Estrada, who was awarded £75million after her divorce from late Saudi billionaire Walid Juffali, was enjoying a last hurrah before the imposition of the rule of six.

The 57-year-old was just one of the well-heeled guests partying among fake parrots and wild cats at private members' club Annabel's, which held its annual Jungle party at the weekend. 

Estrada, who during her celebrated divorce case claimed that she required £1 million a year for new clothes, posed in a silver dress between two dancers wearing Brazilian-themed costumes.

'Time to rule and rest in the sumptuousness of Annabel's,' she said.

'Enjoy it while we still can.'

With parts of Central London still far quieter than usual, I'm heartened to hear of the example set by David Cameron.

Though these days based at the family home in Oxfordshire, he was in town last night to entertain admirers at the final event of the prestigious Wimbledon Bookfest.

'It was only announced 24 hours in advance,' a London bookworm tells me of the former PM's appearance, at which he talked about his memoirs, For The Record. 'Tickets sold out in hours.'

The 'bookfest' had already heard from London glitterati like Ruby Wax and Jeremy Vine, who had appeared in a marquee on Wimbledon Common — which might sound like the perfect setting for Dave and the £25,000 shepherd's hut in which he slaved away on his masterpiece.

But he opted, instead, for the grandeur of the Great Hall at King's College School, Wimbledon. More fitting for a former PM.

Theatreland might be struggling during the pandemic, but Noises Off playwright Michael Frayn thinks social distancing could breathe new life into the art form when theatres reopen. 

'There's something to be said for social distancing on the stage — some directors do a lot of it,' says Frayn. 

'Things like love scenes are much more effective if you get the lovers apart, on opposite sides of the stage, and make them play to each other across the width of it.

'I really don't think we lose very much if all the people who are supposed to have sword fights onstage have to stay well out of bash-bash-bash range of each other.'

TV cook Nadiya Hussain, who baked the Queen's 90th birthday cake, now has her eyes on creating a special confection for her hero, Sir David Attenborough. 

'I would absolutely love to make a cake for Sir David, whether it's his birthday or not, because I absolutely adore him,' she swoons.

'Apart from David, I wish that my grandad were still alive, because he'd never eaten cake in his life.

'He was from Bangladesh, where cake is not a thing.'



Hollywood star Rose McGowan, a MeToo cheerleader, says swimming with her dog, Pearl, helps her keep a cool head.

Sharing a picture of herself in the sea while holding her Havanese aloft, she describes this act of canine communion as 'healing' and 'cleansing'.

'Pearl was prescribed to me by my trauma doctor for my PTSD and is a registered Emotional Support Animal,' explains Rose.

'I am so grateful this little being has come into my life as a healing force for good.'
